1
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm here with a couple of professors </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Wilfrid laurier to talk about the </v>

2
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Lindsay Shepherd scandal and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened with Professor Rambo Canada and</v>

3
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.210
<v Speaker 1>Pimlott and administrator Adrianne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joel,</v>

4
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.350
<v Speaker 1>Adrian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right Atria,</v>

5
00:00:27.351 --> 00:00:29.590
<v Speaker 1>Joel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I think is the Unsung,</v>

6
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.370
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unsung villain in this entire </v>

7
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.460
<v Speaker 1>process because she seems to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>escaped relatively unscathed,</v>

8
00:00:36.461 --> 00:00:39.790
<v Speaker 1>even though I think her role is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible than anyone else's.</v>

9
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you guys introduce yourself </v>

10
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.921
<v Speaker 1>and talk about what you've been doing at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wilfrid laurier and also just let </v>

11
00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:48.160
<v Speaker 1>everybody know why we're meeting.</v>

12
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

13
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Dave Haskell and uh,</v>

14
00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:55.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm a prophet Laura Day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the Faculty of Liberal Arts.</v>

15
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is my colleague.</v>

16
00:00:56.851 --> 00:00:57.450
<v Speaker 2>Will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will,</v>

17
00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.850
<v Speaker 2>how do we come into this whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is,</v>

18
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.950
<v Speaker 2>this didn't just happen with the Lindsay</v>
<v Speaker 2>affair,</v>

19
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 2>like to background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We support maximum freedom of expression</v>

20
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.960
<v Speaker 2>and we've really found each other along </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a few other professors who feel the</v>

21
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:17.121
<v Speaker 2>same way that we do that free expression</v>
<v Speaker 2>and free inquiry is the core value of a </v>

22
00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 2>university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And but sort of how did we run out</v>

23
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.870
<v Speaker 3>each other business school?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

24
00:01:22.871 --> 00:01:27.871
<v Speaker 3>so my exposure to the faculty of Arts is</v>
<v Speaker 3>minimal and I've been really sheltered </v>

25
00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:30.900
<v Speaker 3>from this professionally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but watching what's happening in the U.</v>

26
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:33.360
<v Speaker 3>s watching what was happening to you at </v>
<v Speaker 3>uft,</v>

27
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm a Grad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did my phd here and um,</v>

28
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.860
<v Speaker 3>it was in January that our university </v>
<v Speaker 3>leadership sent out an email,</v>

29
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.190
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>explaining to the faculty how to think </v>

30
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.470
<v Speaker 3>about the trump travel ban and declaring</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

31
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.540
<v Speaker 3>its,</v>
<v Speaker 3>its commitment to diversity,</v>

32
00:01:52.541 --> 00:01:57.520
<v Speaker 3>equity and inclusivity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was really offended by that,</v>

33
00:01:57.521 --> 00:02:01.540
<v Speaker 3>that they would see fit to pronounce on </v>
<v Speaker 3>a political issue in another country.</v>

34
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.460
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>offended.</v>

35
00:02:03.461 --> 00:02:05.640
<v Speaker 3>Why I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

36
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.980
<v Speaker 3>I've got a phd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm able to reach my own conclusions </v>

37
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:11.530
<v Speaker 3>about whether these things are good or </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>

38
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't need my administration preaching</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me about the,</v>

39
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.310
<v Speaker 3>the right way to think about an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a political issue,</v>

40
00:02:18.311 --> 00:02:19.370
<v Speaker 3>particularly consumer.</v>

41
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.400
<v Speaker 3>So why do you think they did that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think they were thinking </v>

42
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.960
<v Speaker 3>when they did that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that sort of seems self evident,</v>

43
00:02:25.961 --> 00:02:26.630
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>To the Snot,</v>

44
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.370
<v Speaker 3>the administration's role to dictate a </v>
<v Speaker 3>political stance to the faculty.</v>

45
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.840
<v Speaker 3>That's just clearly not their role.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what do you think they were thinking?</v>

46
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.740
<v Speaker 3>It would seem like a manifestation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump derangement syndrome.</v>

47
00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:43.741
<v Speaker 3>It seems like just the same reaction </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the Democrats in the US for having </v>

48
00:02:43.741 --> 00:02:48.230
<v Speaker 3>that they lost to this horrible person </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they couldn't understand why and it </v>

49
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.900
<v Speaker 3>was so reprehensible and here was yet </v>
<v Speaker 3>another terrible thing that he was doing</v>

50
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.140
<v Speaker 3>and we must all agree how bad it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

51
00:02:56.141 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean even if the funny thing is even </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can make that and say</v>

52
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.100
<v Speaker 4>personally and even socially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea that you could make that case </v>

53
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.110
<v Speaker 4>and then be university administration </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then tell your faculty to think that</v>

54
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:13.111
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's taking it in a whole </v>

55
00:03:13.111 --> 00:03:14.821
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's taking it to a whole whole </v>

56
00:03:14.821 --> 00:03:15.310
<v Speaker 4>different level of presump </v>
<v Speaker 4>presumptuousness.</v>

57
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.570
<v Speaker 4>Did that come from our administration?</v>
<v Speaker 4>From the diversity and equity from the </v>

58
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 4>administration,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the leadership,</v>

59
00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:22.230
<v Speaker 4>the university leadership.</v>

60
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.330
<v Speaker 2>I remember the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's confusing because I remember we </v>

61
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 2>also got an email from the diversity and</v>
<v Speaker 2>equity office when when trump won and </v>

62
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.200
<v Speaker 2>they said that they've created a safe </v>
<v Speaker 2>space and they were going to be open for</v>

63
00:03:36.201 --> 00:03:39.260
<v Speaker 2>extra hours in case anybody needed to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>and find</v>

64
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.920
<v Speaker 4>comfort.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

65
00:03:40.921 --> 00:03:42.570
<v Speaker 4>That happened a lot in the United </v>
<v Speaker 4>States.</v>

66
00:03:42.571 --> 00:03:43.470
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you think?</v>

67
00:03:43.471 --> 00:03:45.630
<v Speaker 4>At least the Americans have some </v>
<v Speaker 4>justification for it,</v>

68
00:03:45.631 --> 00:03:47.490
<v Speaker 4>given that it's their country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

69
00:03:47.491 --> 00:03:52.491
<v Speaker 4>we need safe spaces because a </v>
<v Speaker 4>conservative was elected in the United </v>

70
00:03:52.491 --> 00:03:52.890
<v Speaker 4>States and they're not even in our </v>
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>

71
00:03:52.891 --> 00:03:55.010
<v Speaker 4>It does seem to be a little bit on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>absurd side.</v>

72
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just to me,</v>

73
00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't send out an email when </v>

74
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.071
<v Speaker 2>Justin Trudeau won and I have to imagine</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there were some students who were </v>

75
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:07.750
<v Speaker 2>offended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's got to be conservative </v>

76
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.750
<v Speaker 2>students at l'oreal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

77
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.550
<v Speaker 2>It's very much a one sided conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we talk about administration,</v>

78
00:04:10.551 --> 00:04:12.530
<v Speaker 2>when we talk about the diversity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>equity office,</v>

79
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.830
<v Speaker 2>they talk about diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they really don't mean it because </v>

80
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.700
<v Speaker 2>they do not want those students who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideologically diverse.</v>

81
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.030
<v Speaker 2>They talk about inclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they purposely will exclude those </v>

82
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.420
<v Speaker 2>students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And an email like that is proof positive</v>

83
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.770
<v Speaker 2>of that kind of exclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what?</v>

84
00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.480
<v Speaker 4>Well that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was the thing that just got me </v>

85
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.240
<v Speaker 4>hopping mad and I was emailing back and </v>
<v Speaker 4>forth with a colleague at Queens,</v>

86
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.700
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we were talking about the importance</v>

87
00:04:37.701 --> 00:04:40.240
<v Speaker 4>of free speech and this had outraged me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

88
00:04:40.241 --> 00:04:45.241
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he sent me a link to a star article </v>

89
00:04:45.241 --> 00:04:48.581
<v Speaker 4>that David had written.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is now maybe a month later in </v>

90
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.270
<v Speaker 4>February or March about a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guest speaker.</v>

91
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.870
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Daniel.</v>

92
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.590
<v Speaker 4>Roberta.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

93
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.440
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

94
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.650
<v Speaker 4>And that she couldn't speak and where </v>
<v Speaker 4>she was,</v>

95
00:04:54.651 --> 00:04:55.280
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

96
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.740
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>commercial lawyer.</v>

97
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

98
00:04:57.441 --> 00:04:58.310
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

99
00:04:58.311 --> 00:05:01.190
<v Speaker 4>So merely because she served as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>defense lawyer for someone,</v>

100
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.670
<v Speaker 4>she was pilloried.</v>

101
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.780
<v Speaker 2>Well this was another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when people look at the Lindsay </v>

102
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.390
<v Speaker 2>Shepherd affair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not an isolated case at Wilfrid </v>

103
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.230
<v Speaker 2>laurier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something that is,</v>

104
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.480
<v Speaker 2>it is a regular occurrence and now it </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't always as high profile,</v>

105
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.710
<v Speaker 2>but whether it's students in my office </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying I can't speak,</v>

106
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:28.100
<v Speaker 2>whether it's my colleagues sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying to their students who believes </v>

107
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.491
<v Speaker 2>that they're stifled and every hand goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and there have been cases of that </v>

108
00:05:31.491 --> 00:05:34.941
<v Speaker 2>colleagues have come and told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've got these other examples like </v>

109
00:05:34.941 --> 00:05:38.421
<v Speaker 2>when Daniel came to speak at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Brantford campus of Wilford Laurey and </v>

110
00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:42.720
<v Speaker 2>some students agitated until she was </v>
<v Speaker 2>forced not to do so and,</v>

111
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.060
<v Speaker 2>and my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>My President Greg,</v>

112
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.430
<v Speaker 2>we should provide some background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was the case.</v>

113
00:05:47.431 --> 00:05:48.230
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so give me a.</v>

114
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.950
<v Speaker 2>She was a CBC journalist who was accused</v>
<v Speaker 2>of sexual assault and sexual misbehavior</v>

115
00:05:52.951 --> 00:05:56.700
<v Speaker 2>by a number of people who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately let go at CBC,</v>

116
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 2>who was dragged</v>

117
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.140
<v Speaker 1>viciously through the press,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

118
00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:05.141
<v Speaker 1>and then was found innocent in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>courts now,</v>

119
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.370
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he had a defense lawyer.</v>

120
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.750
<v Speaker 1>The defense lawyer had been invited to,</v>

121
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:09.910
<v Speaker 4>to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

122
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.940
<v Speaker 4>She was part of the defense team.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was going to speak and she wasn't </v>

123
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:14.940
<v Speaker 4>going to speak about the Ghomeshi trial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

124
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:20.130
<v Speaker 4>she was going to talk about what it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like to be a high power powerful lawyer,</v>

125
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.010
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

126
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:27.140
<v Speaker 4>in the big city in Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I mean that would have been really </v>

127
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.701
<v Speaker 4>valuable for the criminology students,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the students who were agitating </v>

128
00:06:29.921 --> 00:06:33.970
<v Speaker 4>against her really with the support of </v>
<v Speaker 4>several professors,</v>

129
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.170
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were saying,</v>

130
00:06:35.171 --> 00:06:35.500
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

131
00:06:35.501 --> 00:06:37.510
<v Speaker 4>if she comes on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it will trigger students.</v>

132
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:38.760
<v Speaker 4>It will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

133
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.830
<v Speaker 4>it will mentally harm students.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that was used as justification </v>

134
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.010
<v Speaker 4>for the act.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Interesting to,</v>

135
00:06:45.011 --> 00:06:47.870
<v Speaker 4>to me to see that these claims of harm </v>
<v Speaker 4>and so forth or</v>

136
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.890
<v Speaker 1>generally put forth by people who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>no clinical expertise whatsoever.</v>

137
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.970
<v Speaker 1>And their idea is that the way that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all that,</v>

138
00:06:55.971 --> 00:07:00.971
<v Speaker 1>the way to aid people's mental health is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to protect them and there's no evidence </v>

139
00:07:00.971 --> 00:07:04.571
<v Speaker 1>for that whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the second is that in your attempts </v>

140
00:07:04.571 --> 00:07:09.011
<v Speaker 1>to protect them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best thing to do is to shelter them </v>

141
00:07:09.011 --> 00:07:10.040
<v Speaker 1>from exposure to ideas that would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenging or frightening,</v>

142
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.550
<v Speaker 1>which is precisely the opposite of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>a clinician does when he's trying to.</v>

143
00:07:13.551 --> 00:07:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Or she is trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

144
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.930
<v Speaker 1>deal with someone who has access </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>

145
00:07:17.931 --> 00:07:21.860
<v Speaker 1>What you do in a case where someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>has access anxiety,</v>

146
00:07:21.861 --> 00:07:23.840
<v Speaker 1>even as a consequence of a trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

147
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:29.290
<v Speaker 1>is you get them to voluntarily expose </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves to increasingly larger doses </v>

148
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.640
<v Speaker 1>of exactly what frightens them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the curative route.</v>

149
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.710
<v Speaker 1>So not only is it a advice that's being </v>
<v Speaker 1>disseminated,</v>

150
00:07:36.711 --> 00:07:41.711
<v Speaker 1>say by people who aren't clinicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually advice that's being </v>

151
00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:44.621
<v Speaker 1>disseminated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are promoting the opposite of what </v>

152
00:07:44.621 --> 00:07:45.740
<v Speaker 1>an informed clinician would do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't.</v>

153
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.360
<v Speaker 1>That isn't my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

154
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.840
<v Speaker 1>that's as close to a consensus as </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything you could reach among clinical </v>

155
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:52.850
<v Speaker 1>practitioners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

156
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.420
<v Speaker 1>One rules for clinical improvement is </v>
<v Speaker 1>get your story straight,</v>

157
00:07:56.421 --> 00:07:58.250
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk about your past,</v>

158
00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.090
<v Speaker 1>sorted out and expose yourself to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you're afraid of that you're</v>

159
00:08:02.091 --> 00:08:04.400
<v Speaker 1>inclined to avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the pathway to,</v>

160
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.640
<v Speaker 1>to resilience and more robust mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>health.</v>

161
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So tell us the story a bit.</v>

162
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:14.530
<v Speaker 1>You guys have an inside view of what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened on the Wilfred laurier campus </v>

163
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.120
<v Speaker 1>since the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Lindsay Shepherd fair broke.</v>

164
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.540
<v Speaker 4>I should just say that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

165
00:08:18.541 --> 00:08:23.541
<v Speaker 4>after this rubber tie event,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I read David's piece and immediately </v>

166
00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:27.090
<v Speaker 4>emailed him and just say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's how we injured and uh,</v>

167
00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:32.210
<v Speaker 4>we met and we had lunch and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in just talked about free speech and the</v>

168
00:08:33.061 --> 00:08:35.730
<v Speaker 4>Chicago statement and how can we get it </v>
<v Speaker 4>implemented the university,</v>

169
00:08:35.731 --> 00:08:38.130
<v Speaker 4>but we just couldn't see any way forward</v>
<v Speaker 4>and really.</v>

170
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.200
<v Speaker 4>So that's another thing we want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>discuss.</v>

171
00:08:40.201 --> 00:08:42.570
<v Speaker 4>You guys have rewritten the Chicago </v>
<v Speaker 4>statement,</v>

172
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:47.870
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that it's more appropriate in the </v>

173
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:47.870
<v Speaker 4>Canadian context,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

174
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.140
<v Speaker 4>We call it the Laurie Laurie a statement</v>
<v Speaker 4>for freedom of expression.</v>

175
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:49.800
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

176
00:08:49.801 --> 00:08:53.580
<v Speaker 4>And you've been trying to convince or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you're trying to be in,</v>

177
00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:58.880
<v Speaker 4>you've been trying to communicate the </v>
<v Speaker 4>university authorities to have that </v>

178
00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.810
<v Speaker 4>ratified essentially adopted as a state </v>
<v Speaker 4>of principles and have you had any </v>

179
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:03.600
<v Speaker 4>success with that or what's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequence?</v>

180
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:08.630
<v Speaker 4>They deferred to a task force that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be held and we can certainly.</v>

181
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:13.700
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as in is that in the aftermath of the </v>

182
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:13.980
<v Speaker 4>shepherd affairs that going to be part </v>
<v Speaker 4>of it really do anything over the summer</v>

183
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:18.980
<v Speaker 4>just because it just seemed too big a </v>
<v Speaker 4>mountain a and there seemed to be no way</v>

184
00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:23.900
<v Speaker 4>to introduce the idea right now you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>got your</v>

185
00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.470
<v Speaker 2>catalyst and Lindsay shepherd becomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>the catalyst and and,</v>

186
00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:32.730
<v Speaker 2>and you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a object lesson in what goes on at </v>

187
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.720
<v Speaker 2>l'oreal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also what an object lesson in how </v>

188
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.091
<v Speaker 2>you handle these free speech opponents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's really given a model that other </v>

189
00:09:43.721 --> 00:09:45.850
<v Speaker 2>students I hope will follow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>

190
00:09:45.851 --> 00:09:49.770
<v Speaker 2>it was through this robot tie thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got to know each other and,</v>

191
00:09:49.771 --> 00:09:51.030
<v Speaker 2>and a few others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

192
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:55.600
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple more of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so about five I think he told me.</v>

193
00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:56.590
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

194
00:09:56.591 --> 00:10:00.340
<v Speaker 2>so the rope Italians incident really </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought us out of the woodwork.</v>

195
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.750
<v Speaker 2>We started a chat and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

196
00:10:01.751 --> 00:10:04.570
<v Speaker 2>we see this problem on our university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what to do.</v>

197
00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:08.020
<v Speaker 2>And then when the Lindsay Shepherd </v>
<v Speaker 2>scandal broke,</v>

198
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:12.040
<v Speaker 2>we all immediately we were emailing as </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's happened again,</v>

199
00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.050
<v Speaker 2>is essentially what we were saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we said,</v>

200
00:10:14.051 --> 00:10:15.850
<v Speaker 2>we've got to do something about this.</v>

201
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:17.380
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd already,</v>

202
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:23.880
<v Speaker 2>I was out on a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a trip and I came home and I said to </v>

203
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:23.880
<v Speaker 2>my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where are the newspapers?</v>

204
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.220
<v Speaker 2>This was a November twelfth when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story broke Christie Blatchford story.</v>

205
00:10:27.221 --> 00:10:28.240
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey honey,</v>

206
00:10:28.241 --> 00:10:29.170
<v Speaker 2>where are the newspaper?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

207
00:10:29.171 --> 00:10:30.820
<v Speaker 2>I can't let you see him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

208
00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:32.410
<v Speaker 2>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

209
00:10:32.411 --> 00:10:37.411
<v Speaker 2>you cannot read the papers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course it was [inaudible] </v>

210
00:10:37.411 --> 00:10:37.930
<v Speaker 2>Christie Blatchford articles in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as soon as I read it,</v>

211
00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:43.380
<v Speaker 2>I was beside myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it's happened again and this </v>

212
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:43.380
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is really terrible.</v>

213
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.500
<v Speaker 2>They've attacked a Ta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is what they've done.</v>

214
00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:49.950
<v Speaker 2>So I contact with the full force of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>administration and claims that she had </v>

215
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:53.590
<v Speaker 2>done mental harm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>broken two laws to laws,</v>

216
00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:58.360
<v Speaker 2>federal and provincial is sincerely </v>
<v Speaker 2>worried that they were going to railroad</v>

217
00:10:58.361 --> 00:10:59.170
<v Speaker 2>this young lady</v>

218
00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.090
<v Speaker 4>so they could have easily taken her to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Ontario Human Rights Code.</v>

219
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.050
<v Speaker 2>The mission would have had field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was gonna Happen?</v>

220
00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.910
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I contacted Christie Blatchford.</v>

221
00:11:05.911 --> 00:11:07.200
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you put me in touch with her?</v>

222
00:11:07.201 --> 00:11:10.860
<v Speaker 2>She was kind enough to do so I got in </v>
<v Speaker 2>touch with Lindsay and I said,</v>

223
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:16.790
<v Speaker 2>I know that this is a terrible time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you've got a professor who supports </v>

224
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:17.880
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew that these gentlemen also would,</v>

225
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:23.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then quickly I as quickly as I </v>

226
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.731
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote an op Ed for the Toronto Star </v>

227
00:11:25.731 --> 00:11:26.460
<v Speaker 2>that we just again to saying this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

228
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.960
<v Speaker 2>The world needs to be aware of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was really after that,</v>

229
00:11:29.961 --> 00:11:32.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Monday after the story broke on the</v>

230
00:11:32.041 --> 00:11:33.840
<v Speaker 2>Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we started to talk and,</v>

231
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.390
<v Speaker 2>and how can we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can we assist Lindsey and,</v>

232
00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:38.090
<v Speaker 2>and how can,</v>

233
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:40.190
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the orbit helped you.</v>

234
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:43.110
<v Speaker 4>And the fact that the star ran it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>quite remarkable as well.</v>

235
00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:47.850
<v Speaker 4>So hurry to the star.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Star really does want to do its best</v>

236
00:11:47.851 --> 00:11:49.650
<v Speaker 4>to champion free expression.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

237
00:11:49.651 --> 00:11:52.200
<v Speaker 4>Well you'd think journalists would </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually be concerned about that to some</v>

238
00:11:52.201 --> 00:11:53.620
<v Speaker 4>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think they are.</v>

239
00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:58.621
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that's happened to me </v>

240
00:11:58.621 --> 00:12:00.061
<v Speaker 4>in the last year is that although the </v>
<v Speaker 4>press coverage of what I did just to </v>

241
00:12:00.061 --> 00:12:03.991
<v Speaker 4>remind people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So last year I made a video about bill </v>

242
00:12:03.991 --> 00:12:06.441
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was the bill who's provisions </v>

243
00:12:06.441 --> 00:12:07.300
<v Speaker 4>Lindsay Shepherd theoretically </v>
<v Speaker 4>transgressed against.</v>

244
00:12:07.301 --> 00:12:11.110
<v Speaker 4>Just to be clear about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and when I first made the video,</v>

245
00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:13.960
<v Speaker 4>I was accused by all sorts of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including journalists,</v>

246
00:12:13.961 --> 00:12:14.890
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

247
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:20.490
<v Speaker 4>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>making unnecessary noise and being </v>

248
00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:20.590
<v Speaker 4>unnecessarily alarmist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which were the minor accusations.</v>

249
00:12:20.591 --> 00:12:22.510
<v Speaker 4>And then the more major accusations were</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

250
00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was all the things that you'd expect a</v>

251
00:12:24.821 --> 00:12:25.450
<v Speaker 4>far right.</v>

252
00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:30.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm an agitator to be a bigot and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>transphobic and racist and all of these </v>

253
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:31.210
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

254
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:35.200
<v Speaker 4>but what was interesting was that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>journalists,</v>

255
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.630
<v Speaker 4>by and large,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially the main journalists,</v>

256
00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.460
<v Speaker 4>turned around on that issue really </v>
<v Speaker 4>quickly.</v>

257
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:44.580
<v Speaker 4>It was probably within three weeks </v>
<v Speaker 4>because what happened was a couple of </v>

258
00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.761
<v Speaker 4>them actually went and read the policy </v>
<v Speaker 4>documents that I had referred to on the </v>

259
00:12:47.761 --> 00:12:52.440
<v Speaker 4>Ontario Human Rights Commission website,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which are still there and which are </v>

260
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:52.990
<v Speaker 4>still appalling and have led exactly to </v>
<v Speaker 4>this situation with Lindsey.</v>

261
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.940
<v Speaker 4>And as soon as they read what I had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

262
00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:58.090
<v Speaker 4>being uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

263
00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:59.800
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what outing,</v>

264
00:12:59.801 --> 00:13:04.801
<v Speaker 4>let's say in my video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they started to understand that </v>

265
00:13:04.801 --> 00:13:06.580
<v Speaker 4>this was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I wasn't just ringing a bell for no</v>

266
00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.440
<v Speaker 4>reason at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was actually reasonable,</v>

267
00:13:08.441 --> 00:13:13.441
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of people to go after me to begin with </v>

268
00:13:13.441 --> 00:13:15.601
<v Speaker 4>because Canada is such a safe and </v>
<v Speaker 4>peaceful place and our political </v>

269
00:13:15.601 --> 00:13:19.171
<v Speaker 4>situation and economic situation has </v>
<v Speaker 4>been so stable that when someone comes </v>

270
00:13:19.171 --> 00:13:19.540
<v Speaker 4>out and says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

271
00:13:19.541 --> 00:13:24.130
<v Speaker 4>we're in danger of making a major error,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the logical first response should be,</v>

272
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.500
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something wrong with you.</v>

273
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.600
<v Speaker 4>It's like we're flying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something wrong with you.</v>

274
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:30.940
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

275
00:13:30.941 --> 00:13:32.800
<v Speaker 4>Well in Indiana.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's reasonable.</v>

276
00:13:32.801 --> 00:13:37.801
<v Speaker 4>I think it was reasonable for me to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>hit hard in the aftermath of doing that </v>

277
00:13:37.801 --> 00:13:38.650
<v Speaker 4>because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

278
00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:41.740
<v Speaker 4>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whistleblowers in Canada are alarmist in</v>

279
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:46.750
<v Speaker 4>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have very little to be alarmist about </v>

280
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:46.750
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This.</v>

281
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:46.750
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now,</v>

282
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:48.100
<v Speaker 4>so fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this thing happened with Lindsay.</v>

283
00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:50.830
<v Speaker 4>What have you seen happening on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Wilfred laurier campus?</v>

284
00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.130
<v Speaker 4>Things that I'm not particularly proud </v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

285
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.570
<v Speaker 4>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

286
00:13:55.571 --> 00:14:00.340
<v Speaker 4>I knew that a will and some other </v>
<v Speaker 4>colleagues were going to come to the aid</v>

287
00:14:00.341 --> 00:14:05.341
<v Speaker 4>of Lindsey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I was thinking that once her </v>

288
00:14:05.341 --> 00:14:07.951
<v Speaker 4>recording became public that we would </v>
<v Speaker 4>just have a flood of professors coming </v>

289
00:14:08.771 --> 00:14:11.910
<v Speaker 4>to support our cause,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is we had a lorry,</v>

290
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.130
<v Speaker 4>a statement for freedom of expression </v>
<v Speaker 4>modeled on the Chicago statement.</v>

291
00:14:15.131 --> 00:14:17.260
<v Speaker 4>We thought that immediately people would</v>
<v Speaker 4>just say,</v>

292
00:14:17.261 --> 00:14:22.261
<v Speaker 4>of course we need to reinforce that this</v>
<v Speaker 4>needs to be the primary mission free </v>

293
00:14:22.541 --> 00:14:27.541
<v Speaker 4>expression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>free inquiry needs to be the primary </v>

294
00:14:27.541 --> 00:14:27.541
<v Speaker 4>mission.</v>

295
00:14:27.541 --> 00:14:27.790
<v Speaker 4>And we got that a pretty fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We really did.</v>

296
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.380
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

297
00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:32.380
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and got it on change.org.</v>

298
00:14:32.381 --> 00:14:37.381
<v Speaker 4>And then where I was emailing everybody </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I knew and trying to get people </v>

299
00:14:37.381 --> 00:14:39.940
<v Speaker 4>interested and I would say out of 50 </v>
<v Speaker 4>emails I sent,</v>

300
00:14:39.941 --> 00:14:44.260
<v Speaker 4>I got 15 signatures from personal </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationships.</v>

301
00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:49.770
<v Speaker 4>So even with personal relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could only get a 30 percent hit </v>

302
00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:52.951
<v Speaker 4>rate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what do you think's stopping </v>

303
00:14:52.951 --> 00:14:54.140
<v Speaker 4>professors from signing that say are </v>
<v Speaker 4>clambering on board,</v>

304
00:14:54.141 --> 00:14:57.350
<v Speaker 4>especially in the aftermath of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>shepherd recording,</v>

305
00:14:57.351 --> 00:15:02.351
<v Speaker 4>which we should point out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is one of the things that's very </v>

306
00:15:02.351 --> 00:15:05.021
<v Speaker 4>interesting is that outside Wilford </v>
<v Speaker 4>Laurey and perhaps outside universities </v>

307
00:15:07.311 --> 00:15:12.311
<v Speaker 4>that are in the same boat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the reaction to that recording was </v>

308
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:15.160
<v Speaker 4>universal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

309
00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:18.350
<v Speaker 4>And and national and international and </v>
<v Speaker 4>uniform.</v>

310
00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.630
<v Speaker 4>And the reaction was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the hell.</v>

311
00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:25.690
<v Speaker 4>This is scandalous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing about this that is </v>

312
00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:25.690
<v Speaker 4>acceptable.</v>

313
00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:29.290
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so what's what struck me is so </v>

314
00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:31.811
<v Speaker 4>remarkable is that even though there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>been international outrage over this </v>

315
00:15:31.811 --> 00:15:36.041
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and very and not an outrage of a sort </v>

316
00:15:36.231 --> 00:15:39.440
<v Speaker 4>that's only been disputed by a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>small number of people,</v>

317
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.690
<v Speaker 4>at least to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wilfred laureate responded on mosques,</v>

318
00:15:43.691 --> 00:15:45.950
<v Speaker 4>let's say as if this was somehow </v>
<v Speaker 4>debatable.</v>

319
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:51.230
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as if there were two sides of the story </v>

320
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.230
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>

321
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.230
<v Speaker 4>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

322
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:53.930
<v Speaker 4>I thought Rambo Canada and Pim Lot who </v>
<v Speaker 4>were the professors,</v>

323
00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:59.270
<v Speaker 4>did what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was appalling for in </v>

324
00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:03.160
<v Speaker 4>upgrading her and in the manner in which</v>
<v Speaker 4>they did it and in the language that </v>

325
00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:07.271
<v Speaker 4>they used.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I thought what was truly terrifying </v>

326
00:16:07.271 --> 00:16:10.121
<v Speaker 4>was the presence of Adrian Joel at that </v>
<v Speaker 4>inquisition because she was a </v>

327
00:16:10.121 --> 00:16:14.260
<v Speaker 4>administrator who was hired specifically</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do exactly what she was doing by </v>

328
00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:18.170
<v Speaker 4>legislated necessity on the part of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ontario Liberal government.</v>

329
00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:23.200
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it wasn't just the university </v>

330
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.851
<v Speaker 4>that was involved in this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Her position was set up because of </v>

331
00:16:24.851 --> 00:16:27.341
<v Speaker 4>legislative necessity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is something also to keep in mind </v>

332
00:16:27.341 --> 00:16:27.341
<v Speaker 4>when we're going after the university's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

333
00:16:27.341 --> 00:16:30.110
<v Speaker 4>So you had a hard time getting faculty </v>
<v Speaker 4>on board.</v>

334
00:16:30.111 --> 00:16:34.310
<v Speaker 4>How many faculty members didn't sign it </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of,</v>

335
00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:38.180
<v Speaker 4>out of how many faculty?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Five hundred and 50 full time and now.</v>

336
00:16:38.181 --> 00:16:40.490
<v Speaker 4>And so you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well what's going on with them?</v>

337
00:16:40.491 --> 00:16:41.570
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that some.</v>

338
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:44.420
<v Speaker 4>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know this is hard to believe,</v>

339
00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:49.421
<v Speaker 4>but maybe unaware.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even now there's a big proportion that </v>

340
00:16:49.421 --> 00:16:50.460
<v Speaker 4>are unaware.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I unbelievable.</v>

341
00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:52.030
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

342
00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.460
<v Speaker 4>well that's it's own mystery because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know where you'd have to have been</v>

343
00:16:55.461 --> 00:16:58.490
<v Speaker 4>in the last month to not have noticed </v>
<v Speaker 4>that this has happened,</v>

344
00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.430
<v Speaker 4>that people perhaps in the sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the computer sciences,</v>

345
00:17:01.431 --> 00:17:02.330
<v Speaker 4>the math,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

346
00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:06.230
<v Speaker 4>they've got their head down and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing the research and and so and so.</v>

347
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:08.000
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>diabolical there.</v>

348
00:17:08.001 --> 00:17:13.001
<v Speaker 4>I think that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got very few signatures from the </v>

349
00:17:13.001 --> 00:17:16.960
<v Speaker 4>business faculty meet some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of people just aren't engaged.</v>

350
00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:22.380
<v Speaker 4>It's a bit of a commuter school a little</v>
<v Speaker 4>bit so I think people are just getting </v>

351
00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:22.970
<v Speaker 4>on with their research and their </v>
<v Speaker 4>teaching.</v>

352
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:25.120
<v Speaker 4>Maybe not aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's a.</v>

353
00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:30.140
<v Speaker 4>that's an interesting thing in and of </v>
<v Speaker 4>itself because I think part of what's </v>

354
00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:33.641
<v Speaker 4>led to the occupation of the university,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say by the radical postmodern </v>

355
00:17:34.371 --> 00:17:38.900
<v Speaker 4>types is the proclivity of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientists in particular,</v>

356
00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:44.080
<v Speaker 4>but also I would say the more serious </v>
<v Speaker 4>scholars to be focusing narrowly on </v>

357
00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.110
<v Speaker 4>their field of inquiry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is essentially what they should be</v>

358
00:17:45.111 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 4>doing and not paying attention to any of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the broader contextual issues.</v>

359
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Which is actually a perfectly fine </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy.</v>

360
00:17:52.201 --> 00:17:53.250
<v Speaker 1>When things are going well,</v>

361
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:55.080
<v Speaker 2>but a terrible strategy when they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

362
00:17:55.590 --> 00:18:00.590
<v Speaker 2>and what you also see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we've got these people who might not </v>

363
00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:02.790
<v Speaker 2>be aware and we've got the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the few who are aware and are supporting</v>

364
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.880
<v Speaker 2>maximum free expression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you've got these other people </v>

365
00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:08.370
<v Speaker 2>who are convinced that maximum free </v>
<v Speaker 2>expression,</v>

366
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.980
<v Speaker 2>free inquiry is not a good thing for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>university.</v>

367
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:16.640
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those people are definitely </v>

368
00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.471
<v Speaker 2>congregated within the arts and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>humanities and they justify it because </v>

369
00:18:18.471 --> 00:18:22.611
<v Speaker 2>they are applying a social justice lens </v>
<v Speaker 2>or what they would call a critical </v>

370
00:18:22.611 --> 00:18:25.220
<v Speaker 2>theory lens to this entire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this entire issue.</v>

371
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:26.550
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how,</v>

372
00:18:26.551 --> 00:18:29.850
<v Speaker 2>how about a quick summary of critical </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory or critical theory?</v>

373
00:18:29.851 --> 00:18:34.851
<v Speaker 2>I mean in a nutshell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an idea that came from the </v>

374
00:18:34.851 --> 00:18:38.001
<v Speaker 2>Frankfurt school in Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It transfers over to Columbia </v>

375
00:18:38.001 --> 00:18:38.001
<v Speaker 2>University.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

376
00:18:38.001 --> 00:18:40.590
<v Speaker 2>it is some German scholars who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>Marxists.</v>

377
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:45.680
<v Speaker 2>And what they are saying is that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Marxism as an economic unit or as an </v>

378
00:18:46.231 --> 00:18:48.570
<v Speaker 2>economic philosophy really doesn't work.</v>

379
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:53.570
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't transfer very well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's change it over to a social </v>

380
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:53.570
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a,</v>

381
00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:55.890
<v Speaker 2>it's a theory of oppressor and </v>
<v Speaker 2>oppressed.</v>

382
00:18:55.891 --> 00:18:57.750
<v Speaker 2>And it's very bifurcated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>

383
00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:01.590
<v Speaker 2>you are either one or the other and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are the oppressed,</v>

384
00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.870
<v Speaker 2>you're good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're the oppressor,</v>

385
00:19:03.871 --> 00:19:05.460
<v Speaker 2>you're bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's as simple as that.</v>

386
00:19:05.461 --> 00:19:07.380
<v Speaker 2>There's no nuance or okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

387
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:12.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm being as bad as they are to to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm giving you the really broad </v>

388
00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.701
<v Speaker 2>strokes on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but essentially it does set up the </v>

389
00:19:16.701 --> 00:19:18.230
<v Speaker 2>villain and the victim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

390
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:23.280
<v Speaker 2>and it is the idea that we must do </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything to silence the villain,</v>

391
00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:27.050
<v Speaker 2>the oppressor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to center the oppressed.</v>

392
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.970
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we will elevate the oppressed.</v>

393
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.150
<v Speaker 2>And same thing happened essentially with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the French,</v>

394
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.030
<v Speaker 2>a deconstructionist to 1970.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

395
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.980
<v Speaker 2>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the motivation behind it.</v>

396
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:43.100
<v Speaker 2>But when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you hear them talk about critical </v>

397
00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.670
<v Speaker 2>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is not critical thinking.</v>

398
00:19:44.671 --> 00:19:49.671
<v Speaker 2>There's a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so parents will hear while they're </v>

399
00:19:49.671 --> 00:19:49.671
<v Speaker 2>teaching critical theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that a good thing?</v>

400
00:19:49.671 --> 00:19:54.170
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because critical thinking means I'm </v>

401
00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:54.170
<v Speaker 2>going to show you both sides of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>

402
00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:59.060
<v Speaker 2>Critical theory means I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>deliberately give you one side of the </v>

403
00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:02.841
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell you who's right and </v>

404
00:20:02.841 --> 00:20:05.151
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell you who's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an oppressor and oppressed the </v>

405
00:20:05.151 --> 00:20:05.151
<v Speaker 2>oppressors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bad guy.</v>

406
00:20:05.151 --> 00:20:09.240
<v Speaker 2>The oppressed is the good guy and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very manipulative way of.</v>

407
00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:09.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

408
00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:10.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

409
00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:15.860
<v Speaker 1>so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say two reasons why people </v>

410
00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:16.260
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't sign the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

411
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:16.890
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

412
00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:21.980
<v Speaker 1>the petition one is they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else and they're just not </v>

413
00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:21.980
<v Speaker 1>interested in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

414
00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:22.320
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fair enough,</v>

415
00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:24.480
<v Speaker 1>even though I think that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous at the moment.</v>

416
00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:29.520
<v Speaker 1>The second is that they're actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophically or ideologically opposed</v>

417
00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:30.590
<v Speaker 1>to the proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

418
00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:35.840
<v Speaker 1>And so to what degree do you think the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ladder is the determining factor behind </v>

419
00:20:36.361 --> 00:20:39.540
<v Speaker 1>the relatively small degree of support </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>

420
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:41.460
<v Speaker 1>that you guys have been able to draw </v>
<v Speaker 1>out?</v>

421
00:20:41.461 --> 00:20:42.960
<v Speaker 1>The big thing that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

422
00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 1>a group of faculty signed an open letter</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the University of about the</v>

423
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.220
<v Speaker 4>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

424
00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:49.830
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that,</v>

425
00:20:49.831 --> 00:20:54.831
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the administration needed to make </v>

426
00:20:54.831 --> 00:20:54.831
<v Speaker 4>the campus safe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

427
00:20:54.831 --> 00:20:56.050
<v Speaker 4>They did the same thing with me after I </v>
<v Speaker 4>made my video.</v>

428
00:20:56.051 --> 00:21:01.051
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I made the campus unsafe and 200 people </v>

429
00:21:01.051 --> 00:21:01.051
<v Speaker 4>signed up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He signed a petition.</v>

430
00:21:01.051 --> 00:21:01.051
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

431
00:21:01.051 --> 00:21:04.570
<v Speaker 2>What does unsafe mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is the problem.</v>

432
00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.320
<v Speaker 2>The the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the left,</v>

433
00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:11.770
<v Speaker 2>the far left are taking words that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a traditional meaning,</v>

434
00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:16.771
<v Speaker 2>a traditional definition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're blowing that definition </v>

435
00:21:16.771 --> 00:21:17.470
<v Speaker 2>completely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely away,</v>

436
00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:22.640
<v Speaker 2>and and at one time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>harm meant that there was an infliction </v>

437
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:28.110
<v Speaker 2>of damage that would have lasting effect</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it would compromise the appearance </v>

438
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:29.380
<v Speaker 2>or the function,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

439
00:21:29.381 --> 00:21:31.570
<v Speaker 2>We can think about damage to a car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

440
00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:35.350
<v Speaker 2>lasting and it's affecting the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the appearance or the function.</v>

441
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:39.050
<v Speaker 2>That's what harm is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they've stretched that definition so</v>

442
00:21:39.051 --> 00:21:44.051
<v Speaker 2>that it becomes meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That my an objectionable idea becomes </v>

443
00:21:44.051 --> 00:21:46.870
<v Speaker 2>harm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that when you show a video,</v>

444
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.620
<v Speaker 2>you've made a place unsafe and that</v>

445
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.260
<v Speaker 4>that's the language of trigger warnings </v>
<v Speaker 4>and safe spaces,</v>

446
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:58.060
<v Speaker 4>but it's disingenuous that there was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>trans rally and one of the speakers said</v>

447
00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:00.130
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>letting I can quote this,</v>

448
00:22:00.131 --> 00:22:05.131
<v Speaker 4>apparently letting Peterson's views be </v>
<v Speaker 4>heard in the classroom is violence is </v>

449
00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.400
<v Speaker 4>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

450
00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:06.940
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

451
00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:09.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

452
00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:10.870
<v Speaker 4>You can react with violence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

453
00:22:10.871 --> 00:22:15.871
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's often what I think that I've </v>

454
00:22:15.871 --> 00:22:17.431
<v Speaker 4>thought a lot about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the tenants of postmodernism </v>

455
00:22:17.431 --> 00:22:18.910
<v Speaker 4>left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I would say of critical theory,</v>

456
00:22:18.911 --> 00:22:22.120
<v Speaker 4>but particularly of postmodernism in </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's more Marxist variance,</v>

457
00:22:22.121 --> 00:22:27.121
<v Speaker 4>is that the only motivation for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>construction of hierarchies is power and</v>

458
00:22:28.691 --> 00:22:29.470
<v Speaker 4>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's.</v>

459
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:35.400
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's lots of reasons for producing </v>

460
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:35.400
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

461
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.340
<v Speaker 4>There's hierarchies of competence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's hierarchies of interest,</v>

462
00:22:36.341 --> 00:22:38.650
<v Speaker 4>there's hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies of aesthetic quality,</v>

463
00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:43.800
<v Speaker 4>like there's all sorts of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wherever you can make a qualitative </v>

464
00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:43.800
<v Speaker 4>judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you make a hierarchy.</v>

465
00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:47.820
<v Speaker 4>So there's the idea that power is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>only driving force between behind the </v>

466
00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:52.240
<v Speaker 4>construction of hierarchies is </v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely preposterous.</v>

467
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:57.710
<v Speaker 4>So you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well why in the world would anyone make </v>

468
00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:58.930
<v Speaker 4>that claim that it's only power that </v>
<v Speaker 4>exists while as far as I can tell,</v>

469
00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:03.990
<v Speaker 4>at least one of the reasons is that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>justifies the use of power and if you </v>

470
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:05.950
<v Speaker 4>have your position because of power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is basically tyranny,</v>

471
00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:09.430
<v Speaker 4>then I'm fully warranted in my use of </v>
<v Speaker 4>power against you.</v>

472
00:23:09.431 --> 00:23:14.431
<v Speaker 4>That's all there is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think it's a great justification </v>

473
00:23:14.431 --> 00:23:14.431
<v Speaker 4>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

474
00:23:14.431 --> 00:23:18.811
<v Speaker 4>So how many people signed the petition </v>
<v Speaker 4>stating that the campus had become </v>

475
00:23:18.811 --> 00:23:20.380
<v Speaker 4>unsafe?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was like 79,</v>

476
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:22.580
<v Speaker 4>79.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like that.</v>

477
00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:27.690
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you got more people signing a </v>

478
00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:27.940
<v Speaker 4>petition claiming that what shepherd did</v>
<v Speaker 4>made the campus on Save,</v>

479
00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:29.530
<v Speaker 4>then you did getting some.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

480
00:23:29.531 --> 00:23:34.531
<v Speaker 4>so that's interesting because one of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>things we're going to address later is </v>

481
00:23:34.531 --> 00:23:37.120
<v Speaker 4>the president's letter as a consequence </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the inquiry into the Lindsay Shepherd</v>

482
00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.010
<v Speaker 4>affair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and one of the things she says,</v>

483
00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:44.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm a people who've tried to downplay </v>
<v Speaker 4>what happened at Lindsay at Wilford </v>

484
00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.250
<v Speaker 4>Laurey have said basically</v>

485
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:49.050
<v Speaker 2>two or three things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is that,</v>

486
00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:55.410
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shepherd is not to be trusted and </v>

487
00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:55.410
<v Speaker 1>she's really like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

488
00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:56.440
<v Speaker 1>a subtle arm of the right wing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one.</v>

489
00:23:56.610 --> 00:24:01.610
<v Speaker 1>One.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that she's a reprehensible </v>

490
00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:01.610
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

491
00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:01.610
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are Pedrosa.</v>

492
00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:01.950
<v Speaker 1>I know they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They directly went after it.</v>

493
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:06.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm quite sneaky that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second is that pim lot,</v>

494
00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:10.610
<v Speaker 1>ramboo Canada and Joel misinterpreted </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill [inaudible],</v>

495
00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:12.490
<v Speaker 1>which I think is absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>preposterous.</v>

496
00:24:12.491 --> 00:24:15.730
<v Speaker 1>I think they interpreted exactly the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was written,</v>

497
00:24:15.731 --> 00:24:20.731
<v Speaker 1>especially if you consider the </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounding policies and that's what I </v>

498
00:24:20.731 --> 00:24:23.221
<v Speaker 1>was warning about last September and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>third is that this was an isolated </v>

499
00:24:23.381 --> 00:24:28.381
<v Speaker 1>incident and doesn't truly reflect the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality either of Wilfrid laurier or </v>

500
00:24:28.381 --> 00:24:30.760
<v Speaker 1>other campuses and not stated explicitly</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the president's letter,</v>

501
00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:34.270
<v Speaker 1>and so that's one of the things I wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to discuss because I don't buy that.</v>

502
00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:39.300
<v Speaker 1>I think this wasn't an anomaly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This wasn't people stepping out of line </v>

503
00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.950
<v Speaker 1>and I think the proof of that is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>what Rambo candidate or pim law,</v>

504
00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:43.570
<v Speaker 1>because we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

505
00:24:43.571 --> 00:24:48.571
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're ideologically committed </v>

506
00:24:48.571 --> 00:24:50.520
<v Speaker 1>professors and they and they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not very professional in their </v>

507
00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:54.301
<v Speaker 1>administrative abilities and they went </v>
<v Speaker 1>after a Ta unprofessionally and </v>

508
00:24:54.301 --> 00:24:54.301
<v Speaker 1>stupidly.</v>

509
00:24:54.301 --> 00:24:54.820
<v Speaker 2>That's bad.</v>

510
00:24:55.870 --> 00:25:00.870
<v Speaker 1>That's not really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's really bad was that there was a </v>

511
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:02.860
<v Speaker 1>paid administrator at the meeting who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was hired to do exactly that,</v>

512
00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:08.070
<v Speaker 1>and so the fact that she was there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the proof to me that this is not only </v>

513
00:25:08.111 --> 00:25:13.111
<v Speaker 1>not an isolated incident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a logical and it logical </v>

514
00:25:13.981 --> 00:25:18.981
<v Speaker 1>and inevitable consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>legislative moves that made these </v>

515
00:25:18.981 --> 00:25:23.060
<v Speaker 1>bureaucratic positions necessary and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>practical reality that these </v>

516
00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:25.380
<v Speaker 1>administrative positions do exist on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>campuses.</v>

517
00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:28.860
<v Speaker 1>So there's no isolated incident issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

518
00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:34.010
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you think Lindsay's been treated </v>

519
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:34.010
<v Speaker 1>at Wilfrid laurier?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's your,</v>

520
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:36.630
<v Speaker 1>what's your impression of her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of her personal situation there?</v>

521
00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.740
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so on the positive side,</v>

522
00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:45.460
<v Speaker 2>there have been students who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>rallied to her support and that's been </v>

523
00:25:45.951 --> 00:25:50.951
<v Speaker 2>really encouraging to see a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was some students on campus who are </v>

524
00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:56.260
<v Speaker 2>dedicated to freedom of expression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They mostly are coming from the </v>

525
00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:57.930
<v Speaker 2>conservative clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

526
00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:01.640
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the conservative political </v>
<v Speaker 2>club or other conservative groups.</v>

527
00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:06.920
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although definitely invitations have </v>

528
00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.600
<v Speaker 2>been extended to other groups of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>political stripes or other.</v>

529
00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:11.750
<v Speaker 2>They really haven't rallied to Lindsey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sadly.</v>

530
00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:17.010
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so those students have to a certain </v>

531
00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:20.141
<v Speaker 2>extent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>befriended her or brought her under </v>

532
00:26:20.141 --> 00:26:21.830
<v Speaker 2>their wing or just began associating </v>
<v Speaker 2>with her and saying,</v>

533
00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:24.920
<v Speaker 2>how can we support you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in her classes,</v>

534
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:28.100
<v Speaker 2>and I'm just going from what I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I follow her on twitter,</v>

535
00:26:28.101 --> 00:26:31.000
<v Speaker 2>so I see what's been going on there </v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently,</v>

536
00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:36.550
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think this is inaccurate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other Grad students are being quite </v>

537
00:26:36.741 --> 00:26:37.130
<v Speaker 2>scathing.</v>

538
00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I've heard from her and from</v>

539
00:26:39.481 --> 00:26:42.450
<v Speaker 1>her tweets is that at least they're cold</v>
<v Speaker 1>at minimum,</v>

540
00:26:42.451 --> 00:26:47.451
<v Speaker 1>they're cold and the professors as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the one who told her that she </v>

541
00:26:47.451 --> 00:26:50.160
<v Speaker 1>couldn't use her laptop in class because</v>
<v Speaker 1>she didn't want to be recorded.</v>

542
00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:55.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't script this level of </v>

543
00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:55.370
<v Speaker 2>idiocy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my.</v>

544
00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:57.110
<v Speaker 2>My thought is students always ask me a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Hascall,</v>

545
00:26:57.111 --> 00:26:59.120
<v Speaker 2>can I record what you're talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

546
00:26:59.121 --> 00:26:59.600
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

547
00:26:59.601 --> 00:27:01.510
<v Speaker 2>The answer is yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The answer's yes.</v>

548
00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:06.520
<v Speaker 2>Because you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't say anything in my class that I </v>

549
00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.200
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't publicly say because I and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to be accountable.</v>

550
00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.630
<v Speaker 2>I want people to know what I'm saying in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my class.</v>

551
00:27:11.631 --> 00:27:14.000
<v Speaker 2>I want them to know I'm fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm balanced.</v>

552
00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:16.730
<v Speaker 2>I present both sides of the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not afraid of that.</v>

553
00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:22.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are people afraid of accountability </v>

554
00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:22.420
<v Speaker 2>that that's beyond my understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

555
00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:22.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

556
00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very good,</v>

557
00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:25.180
<v Speaker 1>that's a very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

558
00:27:25.181 --> 00:27:25.900
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

559
00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

560
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:34.100
<v Speaker 1>I think what we'll do now is go through </v>
<v Speaker 1>this letter because what happened </v>

561
00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:38.190
<v Speaker 1>yesterday I guess is the president had </v>
<v Speaker 1>appointed a third party fact finder to </v>

562
00:27:38.201 --> 00:27:41.220
<v Speaker 1>look into what happened with the Lindsay</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shepherd Fair.</v>

563
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there were concerns about that </v>

564
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:47.761
<v Speaker 1>because many people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including Christie Blatchford were </v>

565
00:27:47.761 --> 00:27:50.731
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the lawyer that's representing </v>

566
00:27:50.731 --> 00:27:51.430
<v Speaker 1>Lindsay Howard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Howard Levin,</v>

567
00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:56.640
<v Speaker 1>was concerned that the person who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>appointed to do the third party </v>

568
00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:00.061
<v Speaker 1>investigation wouldn't be neutral </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he had tweeted his agreement </v>

569
00:28:00.061 --> 00:28:04.681
<v Speaker 1>with a variety of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call them politically correct </v>

570
00:28:04.681 --> 00:28:07.171
<v Speaker 1>issues quite publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't look like he's done a </v>

571
00:28:07.171 --> 00:28:09.781
<v Speaker 1>credible job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That that's what it appears to me </v>

572
00:28:09.781 --> 00:28:12.030
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The president who is very closed mouth </v>

573
00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:16.230
<v Speaker 1>or new assiduously neutral about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole affair has released a report and I</v>

574
00:28:16.421 --> 00:28:21.421
<v Speaker 1>thought we could go through it and talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about whether or not we think that it </v>

575
00:28:21.421 --> 00:28:23.020
<v Speaker 1>addressed the issues reasonably so </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think it did in some part,</v>

576
00:28:23.021 --> 00:28:24.280
<v Speaker 1>but I think it didn't in others.</v>

577
00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:29.370
<v Speaker 1>So this is from mcclatchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deborah mcclachi,</v>

578
00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Phd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the president and new vice </v>

579
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:34.380
<v Speaker 1>chancellor at Wilford Laurey and </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively new at it,</v>

580
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.020
<v Speaker 1>so she's really been raked through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>coals thoughts for sure.</v>

581
00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:42.080
<v Speaker 1>She was still vice president academic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the second most senior </v>

582
00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.260
<v Speaker 1>physician for the last five or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's accustomed to this.</v>

583
00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

584
00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:50.850
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it is time for some clarity </v>

585
00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:51.820
<v Speaker 1>around the events of the past few weeks </v>
<v Speaker 1>here at Wilfrid laurier university,</v>

586
00:28:51.821 --> 00:28:53.830
<v Speaker 1>stemming from the very regrettable </v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting,</v>

587
00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:56.170
<v Speaker 1>so that's an interesting turn of phrase </v>
<v Speaker 1>to begin with.</v>

588
00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:58.010
<v Speaker 1>That followed the showing of a TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

589
00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:03.020
<v Speaker 1>clipped by a teaching assistant during a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tutorial as the newly appointed </v>

590
00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.710
<v Speaker 1>president and vice chancellor of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible 106 year old institution.</v>

591
00:29:05.711 --> 00:29:08.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm here to set the record straight and </v>
<v Speaker 1>announced some important changes.</v>

592
00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:12.370
<v Speaker 1>The issue has highlighted some </v>
<v Speaker 1>deficiencies but input,</v>

593
00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:15.100
<v Speaker 1>but as importantly at is created </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities.</v>

594
00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well to me that's a.</v>

595
00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:22.620
<v Speaker 1>that's a kind of marketing doublespeak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we could just go with the </v>

596
00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:26.371
<v Speaker 1>deficiencies issue for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Opportunities for Laurie to improve our </v>

597
00:29:26.371 --> 00:29:28.000
<v Speaker 1>own performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to lead a broader discussion on academic</v>

598
00:29:28.001 --> 00:29:33.001
<v Speaker 1>freedom and freedom of expression and </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities to work together as a </v>

599
00:29:33.041 --> 00:29:36.370
<v Speaker 1>community to demonstrate the strengths </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have as an institution.</v>

600
00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:42.030
<v Speaker 1>When the issue first broke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I erred on the side of caution as a </v>

601
00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:42.030
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a president,</v>

602
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:47.160
<v Speaker 1>as the president of Laurie am sensitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the viewpoints and concerns of our </v>

603
00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:47.620
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>staff and faculty.</v>

604
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:52.830
<v Speaker 1>As an employer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am cognizant that the four people who </v>

605
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:53.650
<v Speaker 1>were in that meeting room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our employees and one is also a student.</v>

606
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:57.850
<v Speaker 1>All four are entitled to due process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not want to rush judgment.</v>

607
00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:03.030
<v Speaker 1>Rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to ensure we were able to </v>

608
00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:04.861
<v Speaker 1>objectively assess the facts and make </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound decisions flowing from that </v>

609
00:30:04.861 --> 00:30:04.861
<v Speaker 1>assessment.</v>

610
00:30:04.861 --> 00:30:09.480
<v Speaker 1>That seems reasonable enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say the events that have </v>

611
00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.510
<v Speaker 1>transpired probably justified her </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach.</v>

612
00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I had taken issues with some of</v>

613
00:30:12.791 --> 00:30:16.180
<v Speaker 1>the things that she had said and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>said when she was on the agenda,</v>

614
00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:21.240
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We hired an external fact finder with </v>

615
00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.331
<v Speaker 1>expertise in human resources issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have received the report and we are </v>

616
00:30:24.331 --> 00:30:26.380
<v Speaker 1>taking decisive action to ensure these </v>
<v Speaker 1>events will not be repeated.</v>

617
00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:30.790
<v Speaker 1>The report along with what we already </v>
<v Speaker 1>knew has led me to the final conclusions</v>

618
00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:35.820
<v Speaker 1>following conclusions and actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were numerous errors in judgment </v>

619
00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:40.801
<v Speaker 1>made in the handling of the meeting with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ms Dot Lindsay Shepherd the Ta of the </v>

620
00:30:40.801 --> 00:30:42.190
<v Speaker 1>tutorial and question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

621
00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:44.980
<v Speaker 1>the meeting never should have happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

622
00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:50.160
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the most damning </v>

623
00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:50.160
<v Speaker 1>statement and the entire report I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>say because she.</v>

624
00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:54.900
<v Speaker 1>And then she says no formal complaint </v>
<v Speaker 1>nor informal concern relative to a </v>

625
00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:54.900
<v Speaker 1>lorry.</v>

626
00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:58.030
<v Speaker 1>A policy was registered about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>screening of the video.</v>

627
00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:00.250
<v Speaker 1>This was confirmed in the fact finding </v>
<v Speaker 1>report.</v>

628
00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:02.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we can take that apart a little bit.</v>

629
00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:05.230
<v Speaker 1>No formal complaint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

630
00:31:05.231 --> 00:31:10.231
<v Speaker 1>So Rambo Kana claimed that one or more </v>
<v Speaker 1>students had complained.</v>

631
00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:16.920
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't say how many and he wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>say what the nature of the complaint </v>

632
00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:16.920
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

633
00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.180
<v Speaker 1>what this document seems to indicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is that,</v>

634
00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.640
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there was a complaint,</v>

635
00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:26.670
<v Speaker 1>which it leaves vague,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was nothing that would constitute </v>

636
00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:29.640
<v Speaker 1>a genuine complaint in an administrative</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense and that's why the meeting should </v>

637
00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.450
<v Speaker 1>have never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess one question would be,</v>

638
00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:36.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if any appropriate disciplinary </v>

639
00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:38.800
<v Speaker 1>action should be taken against Rambo </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mckenna and pim lot.</v>

640
00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.680
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know the answer to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

641
00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:45.700
<v Speaker 1>they're not administrative experts and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think faculty can be,</v>

642
00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:51.030
<v Speaker 1>but by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like I understand exactly </v>

643
00:31:52.031 --> 00:31:54.760
<v Speaker 1>what happened to bring about the meeting</v>
<v Speaker 1>to begin with.</v>

644
00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:55.960
<v Speaker 1>Do you guys know?</v>

645
00:31:56.860 --> 00:32:01.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever we do know we've had to piece </v>

646
00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:03.710
<v Speaker 2>together from different media reports </v>
<v Speaker 2>because as has been said,</v>

647
00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:09.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our president is not releasing the </v>

648
00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:09.590
<v Speaker 2>findings of this like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be,</v>

649
00:32:09.591 --> 00:32:12.020
<v Speaker 2>this is a secret.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Independent investigation.</v>

650
00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.690
<v Speaker 2>We will never know what it actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>says.</v>

651
00:32:14.691 --> 00:32:16.850
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>recommendations are.</v>

652
00:32:16.851 --> 00:32:18.950
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we can take her at her word that</v>

653
00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:20.510
<v Speaker 2>she's telling us what's</v>

654
00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:23.270
<v Speaker 1>and why is she making it secret or </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping it secret?</v>

655
00:32:23.271 --> 00:32:24.450
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the,</v>

656
00:32:24.451 --> 00:32:26.750
<v Speaker 1>this concern with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you call it?</v>

657
00:32:26.751 --> 00:32:28.820
<v Speaker 1>Confidentiality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be the,</v>

658
00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:30.260
<v Speaker 1>the what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

659
00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:33.580
<v Speaker 1>the camouflage behind which these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>are always hidden.</v>

660
00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:37.170
<v Speaker 2>That seems to be implied and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or even said explicitly,</v>

661
00:32:37.171 --> 00:32:41.620
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen other cases where been </v>
<v Speaker 2>disciplinary measures and,</v>

662
00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:45.050
<v Speaker 2>and we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get more details than this.</v>

663
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:46.010
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

664
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:51.040
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the level of </v>

665
00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:51.040
<v Speaker 2>confidentiality that is required under </v>
<v Speaker 2>law,</v>

666
00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.690
<v Speaker 2>but what I can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'll let,</v>

667
00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.460
<v Speaker 2>will talk about what the disciplinary </v>
<v Speaker 2>actions can be.</v>

668
00:32:55.880 --> 00:33:00.880
<v Speaker 2>Let's keep in mind that when Ramboo </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada said that there had been a </v>

669
00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.200
<v Speaker 2>complaint and it says here that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't,</v>

670
00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:07.640
<v Speaker 2>he then echos that in his apology to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lindsay.</v>

671
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:09.500
<v Speaker 2>He then says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

672
00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:11.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm paraphrasing here,</v>

673
00:33:11.331 --> 00:33:14.750
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not being completely accurate in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of what he exactly said,</v>

674
00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:19.960
<v Speaker 2>but he said something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course there are things I can't </v>

675
00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:20.300
<v Speaker 2>discuss because of the complaint that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was made by a student.</v>

676
00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:25.780
<v Speaker 2>So he's echoing what seems to be an </v>
<v Speaker 2>untruth and while this is about</v>

677
00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:29.120
<v Speaker 1>closest statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you might imagine in a statement like</v>

678
00:33:29.121 --> 00:33:31.040
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stating that it was an untruth,</v>

679
00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:36.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said no formal complaint nor </v>

680
00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:39.410
<v Speaker 1>informal concern relative to a lorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A policy was registered.</v>

681
00:33:39.411 --> 00:33:40.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

682
00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:41.090
<v Speaker 1>that's</v>

683
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:42.330
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>

684
00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:46.900
<v Speaker 1>That's as close as you could get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two coming right out and saying that the</v>

685
00:33:46.901 --> 00:33:49.600
<v Speaker 1>statement that there was a complaint was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a falsehood.</v>

686
00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:51.600
<v Speaker 2>And I just want to follow that thread </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a second.</v>

687
00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:57.140
<v Speaker 2>So here we have a controversy that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>started on an untruth and it seems to be</v>

688
00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:06.320
<v Speaker 2>that this is part of the whole modus </v>
<v Speaker 2>operandi here when we're here and </v>

689
00:34:06.901 --> 00:34:10.260
<v Speaker 2>there's been harm and it's unsafe </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence,</v>

690
00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.510
<v Speaker 2>daily violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although again,</v>

691
00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:14.130
<v Speaker 2>when the media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>global,</v>

692
00:34:14.131 --> 00:34:19.131
<v Speaker 2>National News,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Globe and Mail checked in to see if </v>

693
00:34:19.131 --> 00:34:21.510
<v Speaker 2>there were any police reports related to</v>
<v Speaker 2>any harassment or any threats.</v>

694
00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:24.700
<v Speaker 1>No police reports had university of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Toronto.</v>

695
00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:26.260
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at some point,</v>

696
00:34:26.261 --> 00:34:28.360
<v Speaker 1>don't we have to say there was a boy who</v>
<v Speaker 1>cried wolf.</v>

697
00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Well this is even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is more egregious.</v>

698
00:34:31.151 --> 00:34:33.500
<v Speaker 1>Even though then claiming harm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean because you know,</v>

699
00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:37.330
<v Speaker 1>maybe people were getting nasty tweets </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so forth and I suspect they were,</v>

700
00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:39.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is,</v>

701
00:34:39.911 --> 00:34:44.911
<v Speaker 1>is that Rambo Canada and pim lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>directly claimed that there had been a </v>

702
00:34:44.911 --> 00:34:44.911
<v Speaker 1>complaint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

703
00:34:44.911 --> 00:34:47.670
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a big problem that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoroughly addressed</v>

704
00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:50.300
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and in either somebody,</v>

705
00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:55.520
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>heard about the tutorial and the fact </v>

706
00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.080
<v Speaker 5>that a Peterson video was shown a and </v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

707
00:34:57.370 --> 00:35:01.580
<v Speaker 5>kind of found out somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he decided that was unacceptable</v>

708
00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:07.290
<v Speaker 1>and that the right way to approach it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was to claim that a student had </v>

709
00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:07.990
<v Speaker 1>complained because it's not a problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he found it.</v>

710
00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:11.080
<v Speaker 1>It's not such a big problem that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>found unacceptable.</v>

711
00:35:11.081 --> 00:35:14.680
<v Speaker 1>Let's say it is his class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he has a right to talk to,</v>

712
00:35:14.681 --> 00:35:19.681
<v Speaker 1>is ta about what's going to be shown and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's not going to be showing even </v>

713
00:35:19.681 --> 00:35:20.890
<v Speaker 1>though he handled it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think reprehensive in that meeting,</v>

714
00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:25.990
<v Speaker 1>but he could come out and say look like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is what the sort of thing I want to</v>

715
00:35:25.991 --> 00:35:28.120
<v Speaker 1>be discussed in my class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with Peterson.</v>

716
00:35:28.121 --> 00:35:30.220
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a jerk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

717
00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.560
<v Speaker 1>here's the other things you should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrating on,</v>

718
00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:37.560
<v Speaker 1>but to come out and say a student </v>
<v Speaker 1>complained and then to buttress that the</v>

719
00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:38.370
<v Speaker 1>accusation</v>

720
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:41.830
<v Speaker 4>that she had violated federal and </v>
<v Speaker 4>provincial law as well as the university</v>

721
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:46.690
<v Speaker 4>bring in and I don't understand why Joel</v>
<v Speaker 4>was there without some sort of follow up</v>

722
00:35:46.691 --> 00:35:50.550
<v Speaker 4>paper work or evidence of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a complaint.</v>

723
00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:50.950
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

724
00:35:50.951 --> 00:35:52.080
<v Speaker 4>I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

725
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:57.320
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the reason for that is that the </v>

726
00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.841
<v Speaker 4>positions that people like Joel occupy </v>
<v Speaker 4>are so ill defined and so fundamentally </v>

727
00:36:00.811 --> 00:36:02.900
<v Speaker 4>reprehensible in their organization and </v>
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>

728
00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:06.570
<v Speaker 4>in their aims is that this is exactly </v>
<v Speaker 4>the sort of thing that you would expect.</v>

729
00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:11.430
<v Speaker 4>And so I thought she didn't say much in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that little inquisitorial recording,</v>

730
00:36:11.431 --> 00:36:16.431
<v Speaker 4>but I thought the thing she did say were</v>
<v Speaker 4>spectacularly concerning.</v>

731
00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.070
<v Speaker 4>Let's put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The way the discipline.</v>

732
00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:20.600
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

733
00:36:20.601 --> 00:36:22.590
<v Speaker 4>what is the discipline?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you have any sense of this?</v>

734
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:24.060
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

735
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:25.530
<v Speaker 4>I can't speculate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

736
00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.780
<v Speaker 4>Communications are uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well what,</v>

737
00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:33.380
<v Speaker 4>what happens when somebody lies or when </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody brings forth that complaint </v>

738
00:36:33.511 --> 00:36:34.500
<v Speaker 4>that wasn't a complaint.</v>

739
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:35.760
<v Speaker 4>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is that.</v>

740
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:40.790
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the things this document </v>

741
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.790
<v Speaker 4>does not address,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's a big problem.</v>

742
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:44.370
<v Speaker 4>It's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there was no complaint and the reason</v>

743
00:36:44.371 --> 00:36:49.371
<v Speaker 4>she was disciplined was because there </v>
<v Speaker 4>were because there was a claim that </v>

744
00:36:49.371 --> 00:36:50.100
<v Speaker 4>there was a complaint like that's well </v>
<v Speaker 4>we can,</v>

745
00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:53.370
<v Speaker 4>we don't have to beat that to death </v>
<v Speaker 4>claim that there's harm.</v>

746
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.820
<v Speaker 4>What about if there's a claim that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>campus has daily violence?</v>

747
00:36:57.150 --> 00:37:01.200
<v Speaker 4>What if there's a claim that such and </v>
<v Speaker 4>such area has become unsafe?</v>

748
00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:06.380
<v Speaker 4>Does that need to be proven or should we</v>
<v Speaker 4>be seeking disciplinary action against </v>

749
00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.430
<v Speaker 4>people who are making those claims?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a very good,</v>

750
00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:09.840
<v Speaker 4>that's a very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

751
00:37:09.841 --> 00:37:10.540
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's,</v>

752
00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:12.840
<v Speaker 4>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a problem that isn't addressed in</v>

753
00:37:12.841 --> 00:37:13.980
<v Speaker 4>this report.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a big one.</v>

754
00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:15.390
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

755
00:37:15.391 --> 00:37:20.391
<v Speaker 4>and I mean the president is obviously </v>
<v Speaker 4>not happy with this because she also </v>

756
00:37:20.391 --> 00:37:24.480
<v Speaker 4>says the errors in judgment.</v>

757
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:26.940
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No formal complaint,</v>

758
00:37:26.941 --> 00:37:30.600
<v Speaker 4>no informal concern was registered about</v>
<v Speaker 4>the screening of the video.</v>

759
00:37:30.601 --> 00:37:32.760
<v Speaker 4>This was confirmed in the fact finding </v>
<v Speaker 4>report.</v>

760
00:37:32.761 --> 00:37:34.590
<v Speaker 4>So they're not beating around the Bush </v>
<v Speaker 4>about this.</v>

761
00:37:34.591 --> 00:37:39.591
<v Speaker 4>There are stating very clearly the </v>
<v Speaker 4>errors in judgment were compounded by </v>

762
00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:43.560
<v Speaker 4>misapplication of existing university </v>
<v Speaker 4>policies and procedures,</v>

763
00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:48.920
<v Speaker 4>basic guidelines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>basic guidelines and best practices on </v>

764
00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:52.641
<v Speaker 4>how to appropriately execute the roles </v>
<v Speaker 4>and responsibilities of staff and </v>

765
00:37:52.641 --> 00:37:55.740
<v Speaker 4>faculty were ignored,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just not understood,</v>

766
00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:58.290
<v Speaker 4>ignored or not understood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

767
00:37:58.291 --> 00:38:00.570
<v Speaker 4>That's a pretty damn damning statement </v>
<v Speaker 4>there too.</v>

768
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:05.870
<v Speaker 4>So I don't even know how the particular </v>
<v Speaker 4>here I heard Howard levins say that she </v>

769
00:38:06.571 --> 00:38:11.571
<v Speaker 4>was entitled to some sort of represent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lindsay was entitled to some </v>

770
00:38:11.571 --> 00:38:14.421
<v Speaker 4>representation under the bylaws of our </v>
<v Speaker 4>university and she was supposed to have </v>

771
00:38:14.421 --> 00:38:14.490
<v Speaker 4>had that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that nobody offered that.</v>

772
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:20.390
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's an administrative followup at </v>

773
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:22.311
<v Speaker 4>the level of employee employer </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationships to say nothing of the </v>

774
00:38:22.311 --> 00:38:25.610
<v Speaker 4>academic issues at stake here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't have policies and procedures </v>

775
00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:26.790
<v Speaker 4>about how to carry out and acquisition </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's not what she's saying.</v>

776
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:30.500
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a med eval document that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can use,</v>

777
00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:36.240
<v Speaker 4>but one thing Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd want to point out here is that the </v>

778
00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:36.240
<v Speaker 4>errors and were compounded</v>

779
00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:39.520
<v Speaker 6>by misapplication of existing university</v>
<v Speaker 6>policies,</v>

780
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:42.190
<v Speaker 6>misapplication of existing university </v>
<v Speaker 6>policies.</v>

781
00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:47.400
<v Speaker 6>At the end of this document,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she's going to say that our gender and </v>

782
00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:47.530
<v Speaker 6>sexual violence policy needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>reviewed.</v>

783
00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:50.170
<v Speaker 6>So which is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was,</v>

784
00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:51.630
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Was it an error,</v>

785
00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.890
<v Speaker 6>an application or an error in policy </v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

786
00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:55.750
<v Speaker 6>and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is confusing.</v>

787
00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:56.410
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it is.</v>

788
00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:00.790
<v Speaker 6>Because my suggestion would be the </v>
<v Speaker 6>policy is terribly flawed.</v>

789
00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:05.850
<v Speaker 6>We have a colleague who's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>free speech proponents at our </v>

790
00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:06.610
<v Speaker 6>university,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dr Andrew Robinson.</v>

791
00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:11.730
<v Speaker 6>He is an expert in human rights law and </v>
<v Speaker 6>he went through our gendered and sexual </v>

792
00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:15.901
<v Speaker 6>violence policy with a fine tooth comb </v>
<v Speaker 6>and he says this document is unworkable.</v>

793
00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:20.530
<v Speaker 6>It makes thought a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he wrote an op Ed to that effect.</v>

794
00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:23.300
<v Speaker 6>So my point would be,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and what,</v>

795
00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:28.340
<v Speaker 6>and who did he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what organization is he part of </v>

796
00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:28.340
<v Speaker 6>interest?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

797
00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:28.340
<v Speaker 6>but which,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which,</v>

798
00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:28.540
<v Speaker 6>which,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which,</v>

799
00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:30.310
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>human rights and human diversity.</v>

800
00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:31.510
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's exactly.</v>

801
00:39:31.511 --> 00:39:32.810
<v Speaker 6>It says field.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

802
00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:34.450
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so when he looked at this,</v>

803
00:39:34.451 --> 00:39:39.451
<v Speaker 6>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this goes beyond what the Ontario </v>

804
00:39:39.451 --> 00:39:42.001
<v Speaker 6>government was even asking for.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it gets to the point where it </v>

805
00:39:42.001 --> 00:39:45.961
<v Speaker 6>actually makes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can be guilty of thought crime.</v>

806
00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:51.600
<v Speaker 6>You can be guilty of transphobia without</v>
<v Speaker 6>any intent if someone,</v>

807
00:39:53.471 --> 00:39:55.180
<v Speaker 6>if someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've been harmed mentally,</v>

808
00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:58.810
<v Speaker 6>that is enough for conviction under this</v>
<v Speaker 6>particular policy.</v>

809
00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:01.810
<v Speaker 6>It's the same with the Ontario Human </v>
<v Speaker 6>Rights Commission's policies.</v>

810
00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:04.980
<v Speaker 6>Intent doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So this isn't in this application.</v>

811
00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:06.280
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm saying,</v>

812
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:09.710
<v Speaker 6>did Adriana Joelle actually get it </v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

813
00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:15.360
<v Speaker 6>And so is that a misapplication or do so</v>
<v Speaker 6>it'll be interesting if the university </v>

814
00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:17.920
<v Speaker 6>does discipline her,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if she gets legal representation,</v>

815
00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:22.980
<v Speaker 6>who claimed that she was actually </v>
<v Speaker 6>applying the policies correctly because </v>

816
00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:22.980
<v Speaker 6>that is the question.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

817
00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:24.370
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it could be two things.</v>

818
00:40:24.371 --> 00:40:29.371
<v Speaker 6>It can be the policies are flawed and </v>
<v Speaker 6>this is the consequence and they were </v>

819
00:40:29.371 --> 00:40:29.371
<v Speaker 6>misapplied.</v>

820
00:40:29.371 --> 00:40:31.600
<v Speaker 6>We don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if there's definitely ambiguity here</v>

821
00:40:31.601 --> 00:40:33.130
<v Speaker 6>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that's a crucial issue.</v>

822
00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:38.220
<v Speaker 6>I think Lindsay was guilty under the </v>
<v Speaker 6>gender and sexual violence policy and </v>

823
00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:40.120
<v Speaker 6>she was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Adrian was accusing her.</v>

824
00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:42.280
<v Speaker 6>She was [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

825
00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:46.030
<v Speaker 6>it would have been an Ontario human </v>
<v Speaker 6>rights code violation,</v>

826
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:51.270
<v Speaker 6>but GSP,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she was right if there had been a </v>

827
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.270
<v Speaker 6>complaint.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right,</v>

828
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:52.320
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

829
00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:57.700
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And how many angels can dance on the </v>

830
00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:57.700
<v Speaker 6>head?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

831
00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:58.870
<v Speaker 6>Procedures in how to apply university </v>
<v Speaker 6>policies.</v>

832
00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:03.930
<v Speaker 6>Same issue here and under what </v>
<v Speaker 6>circumstances were not followed the </v>

833
00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:07.591
<v Speaker 6>training of key individuals to meet the </v>
<v Speaker 6>expectations of the university and </v>

834
00:41:07.591 --> 00:41:10.720
<v Speaker 6>addressing such an issue as an issue as </v>
<v Speaker 6>such as this was not sufficient and must</v>

835
00:41:10.721 --> 00:41:12.340
<v Speaker 6>be improved.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

836
00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:15.790
<v Speaker 6>The question is who are these key </v>
<v Speaker 6>individuals?</v>

837
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:18.830
<v Speaker 6>Do they mean Rambo cannot pim lot and </v>
<v Speaker 6>Joel is they,</v>

838
00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:20.350
<v Speaker 6>are they putting all three of those in </v>
<v Speaker 6>there?</v>

839
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:25.470
<v Speaker 6>And then the next question would be how </v>
<v Speaker 6>are they going to improve the training </v>

840
00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:30.151
<v Speaker 6>of key individuals?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because that actually worries me as a </v>

841
00:41:30.151 --> 00:41:30.151
<v Speaker 6>faculty member,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

842
00:41:30.151 --> 00:41:33.571
<v Speaker 6>Because whenever the administration </v>
<v Speaker 6>decides that it's going to engage in </v>

843
00:41:33.571 --> 00:41:34.370
<v Speaker 6>some additional training of faculty</v>

844
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:36.710
<v Speaker 4>members,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then that raises the hair on the back of</v>

845
00:41:36.711 --> 00:41:37.140
<v Speaker 4>my neck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

846
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:40.400
<v Speaker 4>is this unconscious bias training?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what they're talking about?</v>

847
00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.280
<v Speaker 4>Which has been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I think,</v>

848
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:44.270
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember.</v>

849
00:41:44.271 --> 00:41:49.271
<v Speaker 4>I've just read recently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no himself who developed the iat just </v>

850
00:41:49.271 --> 00:41:52.901
<v Speaker 4>published a review paper stating clearly</v>
<v Speaker 4>stating clearly that attempts to reduce </v>

851
00:41:53.571 --> 00:41:56.330
<v Speaker 4>unconscious bias by explicit explicit </v>
<v Speaker 4>training.</v>

852
00:41:56.331 --> 00:41:59.500
<v Speaker 4>There's no evidence whatsoever that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>have any positive effect.</v>

853
00:41:59.501 --> 00:42:03.150
<v Speaker 4>And that was nozick himself who helped </v>
<v Speaker 4>develop the IAT [inaudible],</v>

854
00:42:03.151 --> 00:42:05.240
<v Speaker 4>the little coterie that develop that </v>
<v Speaker 4>test.</v>

855
00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:09.650
<v Speaker 4>I'm a chair of the Harvard Psychology </v>
<v Speaker 4>Department.</v>

856
00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:14.680
<v Speaker 4>I'll remember her name in a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Green walled Anthony Greenwald and </v>

857
00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:15.440
<v Speaker 4>Nozek.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's her name?</v>

858
00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:20.530
<v Speaker 4>Mazda three of them developed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're starting to fragment a bit </v>

859
00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:21.440
<v Speaker 4>because the thing is being pushed way </v>
<v Speaker 4>too hard.</v>

860
00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:26.620
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a test that's valid for the </v>

861
00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:28.931
<v Speaker 4>purposes that it's being put to and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>know it perfectly well even though </v>

862
00:42:28.931 --> 00:42:31.100
<v Speaker 4>they're consulting about it and have </v>
<v Speaker 4>made quite an enterprise out of it.</v>

863
00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:32.300
<v Speaker 4>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Zack is,</v>

864
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:37.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems to be a pretty credible </v>

865
00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:37.550
<v Speaker 4>scientist and he's actually looking at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the data and it's clear that the,</v>

866
00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:41.270
<v Speaker 4>these unconscious bias training programs</v>
<v Speaker 4>have zero positive impact.</v>

867
00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:44.090
<v Speaker 4>There's some evidence that they have </v>
<v Speaker 4>negative impact because of course people</v>

868
00:42:44.091 --> 00:42:46.910
<v Speaker 4>don't like being accused of being </v>
<v Speaker 4>unconscious racists.</v>

869
00:42:46.911 --> 00:42:51.911
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm wonder is that the kind of </v>

870
00:42:51.911 --> 00:42:53.771
<v Speaker 4>training,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's nothing in here that says </v>

871
00:42:53.771 --> 00:42:56.081
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is the problem that it says </v>

872
00:42:56.081 --> 00:42:58.271
<v Speaker 4>there will be training unconscious bias.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that the same as systemic </v>

873
00:42:58.271 --> 00:42:59.060
<v Speaker 4>discrimination?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

874
00:42:59.061 --> 00:43:04.061
<v Speaker 4>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the neurological equivalent of </v>

875
00:43:04.061 --> 00:43:04.061
<v Speaker 4>systemic discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so imagined discredit,</v>

876
00:43:04.061 --> 00:43:07.220
<v Speaker 4>systemic discrimination is built into </v>
<v Speaker 4>the structure of the system,</v>

877
00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:12.370
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unconscious bias is built into your </v>

878
00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:15.341
<v Speaker 4>perceptual structures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So even before you act or think you're </v>

879
00:43:15.341 --> 00:43:18.770
<v Speaker 4>biased towards against the members of an</v>
<v Speaker 4>outgroup that's the claim,</v>

880
00:43:18.771 --> 00:43:22.040
<v Speaker 4>and not only biased in against the </v>
<v Speaker 4>members have outgroup,</v>

881
00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:25.510
<v Speaker 4>which is a different claim that biased </v>
<v Speaker 4>in favor of your ingroup,</v>

882
00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.200
<v Speaker 4>which of course almost every human being</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

883
00:43:27.201 --> 00:43:29.030
<v Speaker 4>especially if you think about your </v>
<v Speaker 4>family,</v>

884
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:30.980
<v Speaker 4>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

885
00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:36.040
<v Speaker 4>that implicit bias also manifests itself</v>
<v Speaker 4>in behaviors that would essentially be </v>

886
00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:40.730
<v Speaker 4>categorizable as racist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least at a low level.</v>

887
00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:44.240
<v Speaker 4>And there's very little evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the implicit bias that this test,</v>

888
00:43:44.241 --> 00:43:48.350
<v Speaker 4>hypothetically measures,</v>
<v Speaker 4>manifests itself in measurable behavior.</v>

889
00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:49.250
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

890
00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:55.040
<v Speaker 5>we went through a thing in the summer </v>
<v Speaker 5>where they ran a regression on salaries </v>

891
00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:59.600
<v Speaker 5>at lorry and found that women were paid </v>
<v Speaker 5>a little bit less than men by about four</v>

892
00:44:00.151 --> 00:44:01.900
<v Speaker 5>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so they gave all the time</v>

893
00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:04.460
<v Speaker 4>include jade,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did they include age as a covariate?</v>

894
00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:08.900
<v Speaker 4>The answer to that would be no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The model was a,</v>

895
00:44:08.901 --> 00:44:09.940
<v Speaker 4>it had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

896
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:11.890
<v Speaker 4>rank,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

897
00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:16.100
<v Speaker 4>and I don't know that it had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it only had four categories of professor</v>

898
00:44:16.101 --> 00:44:20.090
<v Speaker 4>though when this has been done at </v>
<v Speaker 4>University of Michigan for instance,</v>

899
00:44:20.091 --> 00:44:24.290
<v Speaker 4>because I looked at comparables,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had 21 categories of professor,</v>

900
00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:29.030
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or 21 departments at ours.</v>

901
00:44:29.031 --> 00:44:30.770
<v Speaker 4>We had four.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you were comparing,</v>

902
00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:36.620
<v Speaker 4>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>within the business school who might be </v>

903
00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:38.160
<v Speaker 4>in marketing versus someone who.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

904
00:44:38.161 --> 00:44:43.161
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know from setting up regression </v>

905
00:44:43.161 --> 00:44:45.110
<v Speaker 4>equations ad nauseum that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the covariates that you included in the </v>

906
00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:46.590
<v Speaker 4>equation determine the outcome of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the,</v>

907
00:44:46.591 --> 00:44:48.830
<v Speaker 4>of the year equation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the conclusion they reached,</v>

908
00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:52.280
<v Speaker 4>the explanation for the statistical </v>
<v Speaker 4>significance of the Jenica efficient was</v>

909
00:44:52.281 --> 00:44:54.290
<v Speaker 4>systemic discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

910
00:44:54.291 --> 00:44:54.920
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

911
00:44:54.921 --> 00:44:55.290
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

912
00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:58.610
<v Speaker 4>that wasn't the conclusion they reached.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the conclusion.</v>

913
00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:03.610
<v Speaker 4>They stepped into the inquiry width and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they gerrymandered the statistics until </v>

914
00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:05.110
<v Speaker 4>they found a regression equation that </v>
<v Speaker 4>supported their,</v>

915
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:07.240
<v Speaker 4>their initial claim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that was,</v>

916
00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:08.990
<v Speaker 4>that's not an inquiry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>

917
00:45:08.991 --> 00:45:11.150
<v Speaker 4>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I hear you saying is there's really</v>

918
00:45:11.151 --> 00:45:16.151
<v Speaker 4>no scientific basis for this idea that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there could be this unconscious bias </v>

919
00:45:16.151 --> 00:45:20.380
<v Speaker 4>that could drive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is evidence that were full of </v>

920
00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:21.950
<v Speaker 4>unconscious biases,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we couldn't even see if we didn't</v>

921
00:45:21.951 --> 00:45:26.951
<v Speaker 4>have unconscious biases because we have </v>
<v Speaker 4>to use shortcuts and heuristics to just </v>

922
00:45:26.951 --> 00:45:31.121
<v Speaker 4>process the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The issue is what measurable impact does</v>

923
00:45:31.281 --> 00:45:36.281
<v Speaker 4>that have on behavioral?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the first thing and it's minimal </v>

924
00:45:36.281 --> 00:45:36.281
<v Speaker 4>at best.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

925
00:45:36.281 --> 00:45:39.740
<v Speaker 4>it's not easy to distinguish between </v>
<v Speaker 4>racial bias and novelty avoidance,</v>

926
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:45.190
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because what you'd have to do is you'd </v>

927
00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:45.190
<v Speaker 4>have to find a person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>interracial group,</v>

928
00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:48.050
<v Speaker 4>say a white person who is just as </v>
<v Speaker 4>familiar with black people as with white</v>

929
00:45:48.051 --> 00:45:53.051
<v Speaker 4>people and then show that there was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bias because otherwise you can't </v>

930
00:45:53.051 --> 00:45:53.420
<v Speaker 4>distinguish it from a novelty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>novelty aversion,</v>

931
00:45:53.570 --> 00:45:55.850
<v Speaker 4>and people are characterized by novelty </v>
<v Speaker 4>aversion.</v>

932
00:45:56.180 --> 00:46:00.530
<v Speaker 4>You already have developed a preference </v>
<v Speaker 4>for that cop over this cup.</v>

933
00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:02.360
<v Speaker 4>I mean it happens that quickly and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

934
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:05.360
<v Speaker 4>It's that subtle and great and grand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>

935
00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:10.600
<v Speaker 4>So the first issue is we can't really </v>
<v Speaker 4>distinguish unconscious bias from </v>

936
00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:11.690
<v Speaker 4>perceptual habit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

937
00:46:11.691 --> 00:46:15.410
<v Speaker 4>or from or stereotyping from </v>
<v Speaker 4>categorization for that matter,</v>

938
00:46:15.411 --> 00:46:20.411
<v Speaker 4>and that literature is being under </v>
<v Speaker 4>assault in a major way in the social </v>

939
00:46:20.411 --> 00:46:23.471
<v Speaker 4>psychology literature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But even assuming that an implicit bias </v>

940
00:46:23.471 --> 00:46:24.380
<v Speaker 4>does exist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you might,</v>

941
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:29.950
<v Speaker 4>there might be grounds for by noting </v>
<v Speaker 4>that people do have an in group </v>

942
00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:31.730
<v Speaker 4>preference safe for their family members</v>
<v Speaker 4>and perhaps even for the racial members,</v>

943
00:46:31.731 --> 00:46:36.731
<v Speaker 4>although it's hard to distinguish that </v>
<v Speaker 4>from novelty or from familiarity </v>

944
00:46:36.731 --> 00:46:37.550
<v Speaker 4>preference,</v>
<v Speaker 4>putting all that aside,</v>

945
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:43.030
<v Speaker 4>which you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no evidence that these courses </v>

946
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:47.321
<v Speaker 4>that are put in place to reduce that </v>
<v Speaker 4>bias have any effect whatsoever on the </v>

947
00:46:47.321 --> 00:46:48.170
<v Speaker 4>bias it's complete.</v>

948
00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:53.440
<v Speaker 4>Even the people who are pushing the IAT </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the idea of implicit bias are </v>

949
00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:53.540
<v Speaker 4>willing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

950
00:46:53.541 --> 00:46:57.080
<v Speaker 4>all these things that we're doing to try</v>
<v Speaker 4>to reduce it have absolutely no effect.</v>

951
00:46:57.081 --> 00:46:58.970
<v Speaker 4>Or if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a negative effect.</v>

952
00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:04.060
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just we don't know that what the </v>

953
00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:05.741
<v Speaker 4>training is going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess where we went down this rabbit </v>

954
00:47:05.741 --> 00:47:05.741
<v Speaker 4>hole was we don't know what the training</v>
<v Speaker 4>is going to be.</v>

955
00:47:05.741 --> 00:47:06.200
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't know.</v>

956
00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:11.970
<v Speaker 4>We have no evidence to assume.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have no reason to assume that the </v>

957
00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:13.700
<v Speaker 4>training is going to address the proper </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem and every reason to be skeptical</v>

958
00:47:13.701 --> 00:47:14.780
<v Speaker 4>that it won't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

959
00:47:14.781 --> 00:47:16.730
<v Speaker 4>So next,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

960
00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:20.450
<v Speaker 4>there is also institutional failure that</v>
<v Speaker 4>allowed this to happen.</v>

961
00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:25.810
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't know what that means because </v>

962
00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:25.810
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to know what the institutional </v>
<v Speaker 4>failure was,</v>

963
00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:27.440
<v Speaker 4>but that's a pretty broad and she says </v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

964
00:47:27.441 --> 00:47:28.880
<v Speaker 4>when there is institutional failure</v>

965
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:33.580
<v Speaker 6>ultimately starts and ends with me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well that's a nice statement and okay,</v>

966
00:47:33.581 --> 00:47:38.581
<v Speaker 6>she's taking responsibility for it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but unless it's specified what the </v>

967
00:47:38.581 --> 00:47:39.100
<v Speaker 6>institutional failures are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just hand waving.</v>

968
00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:44.520
<v Speaker 6>Going forward,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we will implement improve training and </v>

969
00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:46.060
<v Speaker 6>new procedures and engage in a very </v>
<v Speaker 6>specific administrative review.</v>

970
00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:51.360
<v Speaker 6>Details would be nice to strengthen and </v>
<v Speaker 6>enhance confidence in what students and </v>

971
00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:53.140
<v Speaker 6>employees can expect it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Lori specifically,</v>

972
00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:56.350
<v Speaker 6>there was no wrongdoing on the part of </v>
<v Speaker 6>Ms.</v>

973
00:47:56.351 --> 00:48:01.351
<v Speaker 6>Dot Shepherd in showing the clip from </v>
<v Speaker 6>Tvo in her tutorial showing a video clip</v>

974
00:48:01.691 --> 00:48:06.691
<v Speaker 6>for the purposes of an academic </v>
<v Speaker 6>discussion is a reasonable classroom </v>

975
00:48:06.691 --> 00:48:06.880
<v Speaker 6>teaching tool.</v>
<v Speaker 6>While thank God for that,</v>

976
00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:11.910
<v Speaker 6>given that Ti vo is a publicly funded,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a middle of the road left leaning,</v>

977
00:48:12.311 --> 00:48:15.970
<v Speaker 6>liberal news media establishment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a credible one for sure.</v>

978
00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:21.180
<v Speaker 6>I wish that early on immediately </v>
<v Speaker 6>following this story breaking that </v>

979
00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:28.770
<v Speaker 6>administration had said exactly that </v>
<v Speaker 6>because remember for more than a month </v>

980
00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:31.420
<v Speaker 6>now the public,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Canadian public has wondered,</v>

981
00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:36.810
<v Speaker 6>can you show tv Ontario videos in </v>
<v Speaker 6>classrooms that Lori,</v>

982
00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:39.270
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I'm not.</v>

983
00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:40.350
<v Speaker 6>I'm not joking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

984
00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:45.540
<v Speaker 6>Like this was this and there has not </v>
<v Speaker 6>been an answer from administration on </v>

985
00:48:46.091 --> 00:48:47.500
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Very basic question.</v>

986
00:48:47.501 --> 00:48:52.501
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and so people who are thinking about </v>

987
00:48:52.501 --> 00:48:52.660
<v Speaker 6>sending their kids to l'oreal are </v>
<v Speaker 6>thinking,</v>

988
00:48:52.661 --> 00:48:57.661
<v Speaker 6>is that the place where they didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether or not you could show public </v>

989
00:48:57.661 --> 00:49:02.521
<v Speaker 6>television in a classroom?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that the place where it took a </v>

990
00:49:02.521 --> 00:49:07.110
<v Speaker 6>independent investigation to come to the</v>
<v Speaker 6>conclusion that it's okay to play a clip</v>

991
00:49:08.111 --> 00:49:11.770
<v Speaker 6>from the agenda that we still don't?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

992
00:49:11.771 --> 00:49:14.320
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It is the place where all of that was in</v>

993
00:49:14.321 --> 00:49:19.321
<v Speaker 6>doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is Wilfred laureate is the place </v>

994
00:49:19.321 --> 00:49:19.810
<v Speaker 6>where those things were in doubt and so </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're not quite as in doubt,</v>

995
00:49:19.811 --> 00:49:21.760
<v Speaker 6>but we also still don't know what else </v>
<v Speaker 6>is.</v>

996
00:49:22.330 --> 00:49:24.550
<v Speaker 6>What else is still in doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

997
00:49:24.551 --> 00:49:26.170
<v Speaker 6>Because if that can be you wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

998
00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:28.120
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's pretty damn innocuous.</v>

999
00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:33.240
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Any instructional material needs to be </v>

1000
00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:35.971
<v Speaker 6>grounded in the appropriate academic </v>
<v Speaker 6>underpinnings to put it in context for </v>

1001
00:49:35.971 --> 00:49:36.820
<v Speaker 6>the relevance of the learning outcomes </v>
<v Speaker 6>of the course.</v>

1002
00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:39.760
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1003
00:49:39.761 --> 00:49:44.761
<v Speaker 6>the questionnaire is any instructional </v>
<v Speaker 6>material needs to be grounded in the </v>

1004
00:49:44.761 --> 00:49:46.960
<v Speaker 6>appropriate academic underpinnings.</v>
<v Speaker 6>To put it in context,</v>

1005
00:49:46.961 --> 00:49:51.961
<v Speaker 6>the question there is who decides what </v>
<v Speaker 6>the appropriate academic underpinnings </v>

1006
00:49:51.961 --> 00:49:54.810
<v Speaker 6>to put it in context are because that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>supposed to be the.</v>

1007
00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:58.090
<v Speaker 6>That's supposed to be the bailiwick of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the professor period.</v>

1008
00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:03.300
<v Speaker 6>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and with with some leeway for the for </v>

1009
00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:05.561
<v Speaker 6>the teaching assistance and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I worry when I hear about context </v>

1010
00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:10.590
<v Speaker 6>because I've seen opinion pieces from </v>
<v Speaker 6>some of my colleagues who tell me that </v>

1011
00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:15.151
<v Speaker 6>the appropriate context is within the </v>
<v Speaker 6>frame of social justice or within the </v>

1012
00:50:15.151 --> 00:50:16.930
<v Speaker 6>frame of critical theory.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1013
00:50:16.931 --> 00:50:21.931
<v Speaker 6>that's what I'm kind of said to shepherd</v>
<v Speaker 6>was that while part of the reason you </v>

1014
00:50:21.931 --> 00:50:23.440
<v Speaker 6>were wrong was because you portrayed it </v>
<v Speaker 6>neutrally.</v>

1015
00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:28.130
<v Speaker 6>If you had contextualized it essentially</v>
<v Speaker 6>have you had connects July's Peterson</v>

1016
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:33.130
<v Speaker 4>as Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was Rambo kind of statement than </v>

1017
00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:35.651
<v Speaker 4>it would have been perhaps appropriate </v>
<v Speaker 4>to to to edit the video and that is </v>

1018
00:50:35.651 --> 00:50:37.430
<v Speaker 4>equivalent to leading the witness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1019
00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:42.610
<v Speaker 4>And leading the witnesses when we have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lawyer up an authority figure telling </v>

1020
00:50:42.610 --> 00:50:46.841
<v Speaker 4>the person on the stand what to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking my ideas and putting them into </v>

1021
00:50:46.841 --> 00:50:47.530
<v Speaker 4>that person's mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1022
00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:49.580
<v Speaker 4>Well that's how you produce unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 4>bias.</v>

1023
00:50:50.350 --> 00:50:52.430
<v Speaker 4>But.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But my point would be,</v>

1024
00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:56.250
<v Speaker 4>so I'm not saying that this is in here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we really need clerical error.</v>

1025
00:50:56.251 --> 00:50:57.140
<v Speaker 4>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a.</v>

1026
00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:02.200
<v Speaker 4>that's a sentence that doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That I'm not happy about appropriate </v>

1027
00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:06.221
<v Speaker 4>academic underpinnings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To put it in context for the relevance </v>

1028
00:51:06.221 --> 00:51:06.740
<v Speaker 4>of the learning outcomes of the course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>

1029
00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:09.950
<v Speaker 4>It's just administrative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Double speak the whole way through.</v>

1030
00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:14.000
<v Speaker 4>You present in class in order.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The criteria for evaluating that.</v>

1031
00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:16.280
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I showed videos all the time.</v>

1032
00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:21.280
<v Speaker 4>Every class says they have the adequate </v>
<v Speaker 4>underpinnings.</v>

1033
00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:22.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's.</v>

1034
00:51:22.111 --> 00:51:24.270
<v Speaker 4>That's the question is who decides that </v>
<v Speaker 4>did the.</v>

1035
00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:26.420
<v Speaker 4>The answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a simple answer to that.</v>

1036
00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:28.550
<v Speaker 4>The professor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the answer.</v>

1037
00:51:28.551 --> 00:51:30.740
<v Speaker 4>There isn't another answer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no board,</v>

1038
00:51:30.741 --> 00:51:33.770
<v Speaker 4>there's no higher authority,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing else you know,</v>

1039
00:51:33.771 --> 00:51:38.771
<v Speaker 4>and I show I do show clips from Hitler </v>
<v Speaker 4>in my class and my personality class </v>

1040
00:51:38.771 --> 00:51:40.070
<v Speaker 4>when we talk about orderliness and </v>
<v Speaker 4>totalitarianism,</v>

1041
00:51:40.071 --> 00:51:45.071
<v Speaker 4>I show clips from the triumph of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>will and I show this other documentary </v>

1042
00:51:45.071 --> 00:51:47.000
<v Speaker 4>called Crumb,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is about,</v>

1043
00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:52.380
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an underground cartoonist from the 19 </v>

1044
00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:55.421
<v Speaker 4>sixties named Robert Crumb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it is an absolutely shocking </v>

1045
00:51:55.421 --> 00:51:58.661
<v Speaker 4>documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you ever wanted to know more </v>

1046
00:51:58.661 --> 00:51:59.210
<v Speaker 4>than you want to know about rapists and </v>
<v Speaker 4>serial killers,</v>

1047
00:51:59.211 --> 00:52:01.460
<v Speaker 4>that documentary will tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really,</v>

1048
00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:05.360
<v Speaker 4>it's a tough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a tough watch.</v>

1049
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:07.580
<v Speaker 4>No one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

1050
00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:13.420
<v Speaker 4>I can't imagine a like a committee </v>
<v Speaker 4>reviewing my teaching materials and </v>

1051
00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:19.340
<v Speaker 4>allowing those things to go forward </v>
<v Speaker 4>without challenge.</v>

1052
00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:21.580
<v Speaker 4>It'd be a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1053
00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:25.280
<v Speaker 4>The ensuing discussion also needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>handled properly.</v>

1054
00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:27.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1055
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:34.000
<v Speaker 4>we have no reason to believe this </v>
<v Speaker 4>discussion was not handled well in the </v>

1056
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:34.000
<v Speaker 4>tutorial in question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1057
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.920
<v Speaker 4>So whatever handled property means </v>
<v Speaker 4>Lindsay Shepherd managed it,</v>

1058
00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:40.220
<v Speaker 4>which I think is a good sign here </v>
<v Speaker 4>because if we take that as the model,</v>

1059
00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:43.390
<v Speaker 4>Lindsay did present the information </v>
<v Speaker 4>neutrally.</v>

1060
00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:44.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1061
00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:46.670
<v Speaker 4>and she was not taking sides and if </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's our model,</v>

1062
00:52:46.671 --> 00:52:47.600
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a good sign.</v>

1063
00:52:47.601 --> 00:52:48.350
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's good.</v>

1064
00:52:48.351 --> 00:52:49.370
<v Speaker 4>So that's acceptable</v>

1065
00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:56.410
<v Speaker 5>by this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because we're going to three or four </v>

1066
00:52:56.410 --> 00:52:58.631
<v Speaker 5>paragraphs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Find out that we need enhanced training </v>

1067
00:52:58.631 --> 00:52:58.631
<v Speaker 5>for tea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>

1068
00:52:58.631 --> 00:53:01.330
<v Speaker 5>So did she handle it properly?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why do we need to treat it?</v>

1069
00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:01.730
<v Speaker 5>The training?</v>

1070
00:53:01.810 --> 00:53:02.930
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's row on.</v>

1071
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:07.950
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's going to do the training because </v>

1072
00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:09.871
<v Speaker 4>it's not going to be the faculty because</v>
<v Speaker 4>the faculty don't have time or the </v>

1073
00:53:09.871 --> 00:53:13.561
<v Speaker 4>inclination for that matter to run that </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of trains are going to be the </v>

1074
00:53:13.561 --> 00:53:13.561
<v Speaker 4>diversity and equity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1075
00:53:13.561 --> 00:53:13.561
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1076
00:53:13.561 --> 00:53:15.460
<v Speaker 4>that's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's going to do the training?</v>

1077
00:53:15.790 --> 00:53:17.980
<v Speaker 4>I have apologized to ms dot shepherd </v>
<v Speaker 4>publicly,</v>

1078
00:53:17.981 --> 00:53:22.981
<v Speaker 4>as has Dr Lew Rambo Khanna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's supervising professor the </v>

1079
00:53:22.981 --> 00:53:27.271
<v Speaker 4>university has conveyed to her today </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the results of the fact report to </v>

1080
00:53:27.271 --> 00:53:31.221
<v Speaker 4>make the results of the fact finding </v>
<v Speaker 4>report to make sure she understands it </v>

1081
00:53:31.221 --> 00:53:33.240
<v Speaker 4>is clear that she was involved in no </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrongdoing.</v>

1082
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:34.170
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1083
00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:36.650
<v Speaker 4>for someone who is involved in no wrong </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing,</v>

1084
00:53:36.651 --> 00:53:39.630
<v Speaker 4>she should bloody well got raked over </v>
<v Speaker 4>the coals for the last month.</v>

1085
00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:45.140
<v Speaker 4>So the university is taking concrete </v>
<v Speaker 4>steps to make changes to ensure this </v>

1086
00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:46.110
<v Speaker 4>doesn't happen again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1087
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.950
<v Speaker 4>well good.</v>

1088
00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:52.460
<v Speaker 4>It has been made clear to those who were</v>
<v Speaker 4>involved in the meeting with Ms Dot </v>

1089
00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:55.701
<v Speaker 4>shepherd that their conduct does not </v>
<v Speaker 4>meet the high standards I set for staff </v>

1090
00:53:55.701 --> 00:53:55.701
<v Speaker 4>and faculty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1091
00:53:55.701 --> 00:53:56.730
<v Speaker 4>that is a big question there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1092
00:53:57.810 --> 00:54:02.010
<v Speaker 4>How has it been made clear to those who </v>
<v Speaker 4>were involved in the meeting with Ms Dot</v>

1093
00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:07.010
<v Speaker 4>Shepherd?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That their conduct does not meet those </v>

1094
00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:07.010
<v Speaker 4>high standards?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because we don't know.</v>

1095
00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:10.850
<v Speaker 4>Does that mean that the president talked</v>
<v Speaker 4>to them as there'd being disciplinary </v>

1096
00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:11.100
<v Speaker 4>action like we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we.</v>

1097
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:16.190
<v Speaker 4>Because if it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know what would be </v>

1098
00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:18.471
<v Speaker 4>appropriate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I would say that not knowing what </v>

1099
00:54:18.841 --> 00:54:21.750
<v Speaker 4>was done is not appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1100
00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:27.950
<v Speaker 4>and I think it deserves specifics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's what got me into this was </v>

1101
00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:32.110
<v Speaker 4>the Christie Blatchford,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his article was very accurate because </v>

1102
00:54:32.110 --> 00:54:33.810
<v Speaker 4>she already had the audio,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then when we heard the audio,</v>

1103
00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:36.990
<v Speaker 4>it was so appalling what was done to her</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that room.</v>

1104
00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:40.150
<v Speaker 4>It was such horrible bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1105
00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:41.740
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and just such a violation of whether the</v>

1106
00:54:41.741 --> 00:54:46.741
<v Speaker 4>university should stand for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what all of the anger,</v>

1107
00:54:46.831 --> 00:54:49.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the devil's in the details.</v>

1108
00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:55.720
<v Speaker 4>So it's the same with the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how it has been made clear to those who </v>

1109
00:54:55.720 --> 00:55:00.071
<v Speaker 4>are involved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So because I don't mean maybe this is </v>

1110
00:55:00.071 --> 00:55:04.751
<v Speaker 4>something we could talk about too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what would constitute </v>

1111
00:55:04.751 --> 00:55:06.170
<v Speaker 4>appropriate disciplinary measures as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>concept.</v>

1112
00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:11.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have here three people acting on a </v>

1113
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:15.131
<v Speaker 4>nonexistent complaint who produced an </v>
<v Speaker 4>international scandal that damaged </v>

1114
00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:20.980
<v Speaker 4>lindsay in a real sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although it might have also made her </v>

1115
00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:20.980
<v Speaker 4>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it certainly,</v>

1116
00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:24.290
<v Speaker 4>it certainly didn't have to because a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lesser person would have crumbled.</v>

1117
00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:29.320
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if she would feel that she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think she might take exception to </v>

1118
00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:29.320
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1119
00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:33.280
<v Speaker 4>she certainly has not claimed any kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of victim status through this whole </v>

1120
00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:36.941
<v Speaker 4>thing and I think that no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's more a testament to her </v>

1121
00:55:36.941 --> 00:55:40.061
<v Speaker 4>character than,</v>
<v Speaker 4>than anything else because I mean she </v>

1122
00:55:40.061 --> 00:55:41.540
<v Speaker 4>was subject to the kind of attacks I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would say that would have snowed under a</v>

1123
00:55:41.541 --> 00:55:46.010
<v Speaker 4>lesser person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she has risen to this challenge.</v>

1124
00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:47.090
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely,</v>

1125
00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:48.020
<v Speaker 4>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1126
00:55:48.021 --> 00:55:48.290
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1127
00:55:48.291 --> 00:55:53.291
<v Speaker 4>and thank God for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then there has been real harm done </v>

1128
00:55:53.291 --> 00:55:56.000
<v Speaker 4>to the university as far as.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how you would quantify that</v>

1129
00:55:56.001 --> 00:55:58.640
<v Speaker 4>and financial terms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I suspect it's substantial.</v>

1130
00:55:58.641 --> 00:56:03.641
<v Speaker 4>But reputational terms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean now I would say internationally </v>

1131
00:56:03.641 --> 00:56:04.520
<v Speaker 4>this is what Wilford Laurey is known </v>
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>

1132
00:56:04.850 --> 00:56:07.220
<v Speaker 4>so maybe that's an overstatement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think so.</v>

1133
00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:10.070
<v Speaker 4>As these are individual employment </v>
<v Speaker 4>issues,</v>

1134
00:56:10.071 --> 00:56:12.770
<v Speaker 4>I cannot go into greater detail on any </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual case.</v>

1135
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:17.950
<v Speaker 4>Well that could be but know that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>university has and is taking action to </v>

1136
00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:22.121
<v Speaker 4>rectify the situation and send a clear </v>
<v Speaker 4>signal that this cannot and will not </v>

1137
00:56:22.121 --> 00:56:23.890
<v Speaker 4>happen again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That sounds pretty forthright.</v>

1138
00:56:23.891 --> 00:56:24.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

1139
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:30.750
<v Speaker 4>One key improvement highlight is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>need to enhance our faculty and Ta </v>

1140
00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:31.570
<v Speaker 4>Training.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1141
00:56:32.170 --> 00:56:34.150
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

1142
00:56:34.151 --> 00:56:37.180
<v Speaker 4>as a faculty member,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whenever I see that I don't see the role</v>

1143
00:56:37.181 --> 00:56:40.780
<v Speaker 4>of the administrators at a university to</v>
<v Speaker 4>to train the faculty.</v>

1144
00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:45.930
<v Speaker 4>That's not their role.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their role is to move paper around for </v>

1145
00:56:45.930 --> 00:56:49.861
<v Speaker 4>the faculty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fundamentally it is the responsibility </v>

1146
00:56:49.861 --> 00:56:53.161
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>instructors to develop guidelines for </v>

1147
00:56:53.161 --> 00:56:53.230
<v Speaker 4>the roles and expectations of their tax.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fair enough.</v>

1148
00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:56.470
<v Speaker 4>The university also has high </v>
<v Speaker 4>expectations of professors.</v>

1149
00:56:56.471 --> 00:57:00.130
<v Speaker 4>As Ta supervisors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we recognize the need to do more in this</v>

1150
00:57:00.131 --> 00:57:05.131
<v Speaker 4>area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We wreck the university's intent is to </v>

1151
00:57:05.131 --> 00:57:09.451
<v Speaker 4>enhance the training and support for </v>
<v Speaker 4>both the supervisors and teaching </v>

1152
00:57:09.451 --> 00:57:10.780
<v Speaker 4>assistants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>making these mandatory and standardized.</v>

1153
00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:13.660
<v Speaker 4>That's my favorite part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>

1154
00:57:13.690 --> 00:57:15.280
<v Speaker 4>Dismal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that.</v>

1155
00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:20.310
<v Speaker 4>So my suspicions as a skeptic are that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the making of training for faculty,</v>

1156
00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:29.310
<v Speaker 4>Mandatory and standardized will do more </v>
<v Speaker 4>harm than this scandal has done over the</v>

1157
00:57:31.691 --> 00:57:32.170
<v Speaker 4>long run.</v>

1158
00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:35.440
<v Speaker 3>So we don't know what the training is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know who's going to do it.</v>

1159
00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:36.910
<v Speaker 3>We don't know what it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

1160
00:57:36.911 --> 00:57:38.230
<v Speaker 3>but the one thing we do now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it</v>

1161
00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:41.870
<v Speaker 4>mandatory?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mandatory and standardized,</v>

1162
00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:43.160
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1163
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:48.190
<v Speaker 4>Mandatory and standardized.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Be Interesting to see how they'll do </v>

1164
00:57:48.190 --> 00:57:51.251
<v Speaker 4>that too because it isn't so easy to </v>
<v Speaker 4>make training mandatory for faculty </v>

1165
00:57:51.251 --> 00:57:51.251
<v Speaker 4>members.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1166
00:57:51.251 --> 00:57:55.390
<v Speaker 4>You can't just do that by fit because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they can generally tell you to go to </v>

1167
00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:58.220
<v Speaker 4>hell and should gendered and sexual </v>
<v Speaker 4>violence policy.</v>

1168
00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:04.540
<v Speaker 4>It has become clear to us that managing </v>
<v Speaker 4>the new gendered and sexual violence </v>

1169
00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:08.651
<v Speaker 4>policy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now that's the one that's mandated by </v>

1170
00:58:08.651 --> 00:58:08.651
<v Speaker 4>the provincial government.</v>

1171
00:58:08.651 --> 00:58:13.180
<v Speaker 2>So it was bill a one 63,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the provincial bill that said you need </v>

1172
00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:15.620
<v Speaker 2>to have a policy on gendered and sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence.</v>

1173
00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:19.640
<v Speaker 2>According to our colleague Dr Andrew </v>
<v Speaker 2>Robinson.</v>

1174
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:24.670
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we go way beyond what the province even </v>

1175
00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:26.730
<v Speaker 2>asked for to the point where it becomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>unmanageable and,</v>

1176
00:58:26.810 --> 00:58:29.480
<v Speaker 2>and you have instances of thought crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1177
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:34.510
<v Speaker 2>So that's what we have like this like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this where you can claim that somebody </v>

1178
00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:38.330
<v Speaker 2>is transphobic for simply showing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>video.</v>

1179
00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:39.660
<v Speaker 3>Can I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I read you?</v>

1180
00:58:39.690 --> 00:58:44.690
<v Speaker 3>The definition is this from the gender </v>
<v Speaker 3>is from our policies,</v>

1181
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:49.870
<v Speaker 3>from our policy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is an action that reinforces gender </v>

1182
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:52.410
<v Speaker 3>inequalities resulting in physical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual,</v>

1183
00:58:52.411 --> 00:58:53.880
<v Speaker 3>emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 3>economic,</v>

1184
00:58:53.881 --> 00:58:54.660
<v Speaker 3>or mental harm.</v>

1185
00:58:55.550 --> 00:58:57.350
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what's the first part of that again?</v>

1186
00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:57.880
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1187
00:58:58.430 --> 00:58:59.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get lost,</v>

1188
00:58:59.241 --> 00:59:04.241
<v Speaker 3>don't you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is an action that reinforces gender </v>

1189
00:59:04.241 --> 00:59:04.241
<v Speaker 3>inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1190
00:59:04.241 --> 00:59:09.030
<v Speaker 4>so let's start with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>An action that reinforces gender </v>

1191
00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:10.330
<v Speaker 4>inequalities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1192
00:59:10.331 --> 00:59:15.331
<v Speaker 4>So the first thing we might point out is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that no one knows what the hell that </v>

1193
00:59:15.331 --> 00:59:15.331
<v Speaker 4>means,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1194
00:59:15.331 --> 00:59:20.040
<v Speaker 4>It's a box that you can put anything in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So actions that's a problem because </v>

1195
00:59:20.351 --> 00:59:25.351
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It isn't obvious to what constitutes an </v>

1196
00:59:25.351 --> 00:59:25.351
<v Speaker 4>action or an inaction for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I mean,</v>

1197
00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:29.780
<v Speaker 4>and then that reinforces gender </v>
<v Speaker 4>inequalities,</v>

1198
00:59:30.590 --> 00:59:31.280
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that,</v>

1199
00:59:31.281 --> 00:59:36.281
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the sort of sentence that only </v>

1200
00:59:36.281 --> 00:59:38.681
<v Speaker 4>someone who's ideologically possessed to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the maximum would create because you </v>

1201
00:59:38.681 --> 00:59:40.130
<v Speaker 4>can't parse it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gender inequalities.</v>

1202
00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:43.740
<v Speaker 4>Like what does that mean exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

1203
00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:45.650
<v Speaker 4>Well anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>discrimination,</v>

1204
00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:48.590
<v Speaker 4>sex or gender,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't talk about discrimination.</v>

1205
00:59:48.591 --> 00:59:50.690
<v Speaker 4>It talks about inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1206
00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:51.650
<v Speaker 4>Which is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

1207
00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:53.170
<v Speaker 4>it would be different if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the,</v>

1208
00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:55.790
<v Speaker 4>the phrasing had included the words </v>
<v Speaker 4>discrimination.</v>

1209
00:59:56.360 --> 01:00:01.360
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the next part is a resulting in </v>

1210
01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:01.360
<v Speaker 4>physical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sexual,</v>

1211
01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:02.240
<v Speaker 4>emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 4>economic or mental harm.</v>

1212
01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:03.290
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1213
01:00:03.291 --> 01:00:05.510
<v Speaker 4>So it says broadly construed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>both,</v>

1214
01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:09.170
<v Speaker 4>both clauses are as broadly construed as</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can be,</v>

1215
01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:13.700
<v Speaker 4>and the reason for that is to allow </v>
<v Speaker 4>maximum scope per interpretation,</v>

1216
01:00:13.850 --> 01:00:15.740
<v Speaker 4>which is exactly what happened with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Adrian Joel.</v>

1217
01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:16.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental harm,</v>

1218
01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:17.960
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental harm.</v>

1219
01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:19.790
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as you pointed out,</v>

1220
01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:25.720
<v Speaker 2>mental harm is not backed up by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>empirical evidence apart from </v>

1221
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000
<v Speaker 2>posttraumatic stress syndrome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like cognitive behavioral therapy would </v>

1222
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.111
<v Speaker 2>suggest that you actually can do mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>good by exposing someone to </v>

1223
01:00:35.111 --> 01:00:39.221
<v Speaker 2>objectionable ideas when they've eaten </v>
<v Speaker 2>in moderation in order to help them </v>

1224
01:00:39.221 --> 01:00:40.600
<v Speaker 2>become less mentally fragile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1225
01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:43.130
<v Speaker 2>Scott Lilienfeld out of emory </v>
<v Speaker 2>university,</v>

1226
01:00:43.450 --> 01:00:45.790
<v Speaker 2>very credible scholar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1227
01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:49.630
<v Speaker 2>he is one of the mass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's written several textbooks on psycho</v>

1228
01:00:49.631 --> 01:00:50.450
<v Speaker 2>pathology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1229
01:00:50.451 --> 01:00:55.451
<v Speaker 2>He knows his stuff and just this year he</v>
<v Speaker 2>put out a paper where you explored the,</v>

1230
01:00:56.030 --> 01:00:59.090
<v Speaker 2>the empirical evidence around </v>
<v Speaker 2>microaggressions,</v>

1231
01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:03.200
<v Speaker 2>and he did all of the literature and </v>
<v Speaker 2>microaggressions that are of course,</v>

1232
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:08.500
<v Speaker 2>these innocuous actions that are deemed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be bigoted or,</v>

1233
01:01:09.041 --> 01:01:12.840
<v Speaker 2>or somehow sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's rudeness essentially.</v>

1234
01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:17.210
<v Speaker 2>They are actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's showing a video of from Tvo is what</v>

1235
01:01:17.211 --> 01:01:20.390
<v Speaker 2>a microaggression is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what he said was,</v>

1236
01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:25.540
<v Speaker 2>there is absolutely no evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no evidence that </v>

1237
01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:28.790
<v Speaker 2>microaggressions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these objectionable ideas lead to mental</v>

1238
01:01:28.791 --> 01:01:29.180
<v Speaker 2>harm.</v>

1239
01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:34.500
<v Speaker 4>He also said that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the concept itself is extraordinarily </v>

1240
01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:34.680
<v Speaker 4>ill defined,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is also a big problem.</v>

1241
01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:37.210
<v Speaker 4>That was the beginning of our </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation.</v>

1242
01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:40.660
<v Speaker 4>Everything is if you make the box big </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough,</v>

1243
01:01:40.661 --> 01:01:41.890
<v Speaker 4>you can put anything into it</v>

1244
01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:47.230
<v Speaker 2>and and what you see in this gender and </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence policy that will,</v>

1245
01:01:47.231 --> 01:01:52.231
<v Speaker 2>is reading from there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're actually go on to say that this </v>

1246
01:01:52.231 --> 01:01:52.231
<v Speaker 2>can include</v>

1247
01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:55.590
<v Speaker 4>Heterosexism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you can be your,</v>

1248
01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:58.310
<v Speaker 4>your mental crime can be heterosexism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1249
01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:03.360
<v Speaker 4>So what if I said something in class,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the empirical evidence strongly </v>

1250
01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:06.150
<v Speaker 4>suggests that raising children in a two </v>
<v Speaker 4>parent family leads to better outcomes,</v>

1251
01:02:06.450 --> 01:02:10.480
<v Speaker 4>which it does by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it like and seriously it does that.</v>

1252
01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:14.700
<v Speaker 4>Then also that's the question of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well arguably right?</v>

1253
01:02:14.701 --> 01:02:16.350
<v Speaker 4>Arguably our transcripts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that policy.</v>

1254
01:02:16.351 --> 01:02:20.070
<v Speaker 4>Now here's an interesting thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it has become</v>

1255
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:23.160
<v Speaker 1>clear to us that managing the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>gendered and sexual violence,</v>

1256
01:02:23.161 --> 01:02:28.161
<v Speaker 1>Paul's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has led to a confusion in its </v>

1257
01:02:28.161 --> 01:02:28.161
<v Speaker 1>application.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1258
01:02:28.161 --> 01:02:31.161
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is back to the issue we </v>

1259
01:02:31.161 --> 01:02:32.541
<v Speaker 1>described earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a confused confusion in the </v>

1260
01:02:32.541 --> 01:02:33.180
<v Speaker 1>application or in the policy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you just read the damn policy.</v>

1261
01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Now it seems to me that there's no way </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could apply that policy without </v>

1262
01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:42.231
<v Speaker 1>confusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not a confusion in its </v>

1263
01:02:42.231 --> 01:02:42.231
<v Speaker 1>application,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its.</v>

1264
01:02:42.231 --> 01:02:45.860
<v Speaker 1>It might also be that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a confusion in the policy </v>

1265
01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:45.860
<v Speaker 1>written right into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1266
01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:47.340
<v Speaker 1>so that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's of crucial importance,</v>

1267
01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:49.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

1268
01:02:49.410 --> 01:02:54.410
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interviews conducted by the fact </v>

1269
01:02:54.410 --> 01:02:55.860
<v Speaker 1>finder confirmed that the rationale for </v>
<v Speaker 1>invoking the GSV P did not exist.</v>

1270
01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:58.740
<v Speaker 1>It was misapplied and was a significant </v>
<v Speaker 1>overreach.</v>

1271
01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not so sure about that because I </v>

1272
01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:07.131
<v Speaker 1>know that these kinds of policies emerge</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the same sort of policy framework </v>

1273
01:03:07.131 --> 01:03:09.090
<v Speaker 1>that characterizes the Ontario Human </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rights Commission.</v>

1274
01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:13.350
<v Speaker 1>It's the same people doing it and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ontario Human Rights Commission policies</v>

1275
01:03:13.351 --> 01:03:18.351
<v Speaker 1>are written so that they can be broadly </v>
<v Speaker 1>misapplied with no significant </v>

1276
01:03:19.051 --> 01:03:20.550
<v Speaker 1>overreach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1277
01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:21.990
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1278
01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:27.080
<v Speaker 1>so that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To provide clarity of the policies </v>

1279
01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:30.741
<v Speaker 1>intent and to strengthen accountability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We will engage in an administrative </v>

1280
01:03:30.741 --> 01:03:35.451
<v Speaker 1>review with the goal of finding the </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate structure to oversee and </v>

1281
01:03:35.451 --> 01:03:37.320
<v Speaker 1>execute the GSPP and its accompanying </v>
<v Speaker 1>procedures.</v>

1282
01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:41.250
<v Speaker 1>We will also undertake a full review of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the policy and its procedures.</v>

1283
01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so good.</v>

1284
01:03:42.330 --> 01:03:47.330
<v Speaker 1>So they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're saying while it might've been </v>

1285
01:03:47.330 --> 01:03:49.401
<v Speaker 1>misapplied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe the policy itself also has </v>

1286
01:03:49.401 --> 01:03:49.401
<v Speaker 1>some problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

1287
01:03:49.401 --> 01:03:52.350
<v Speaker 2>this is really good news and we had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>meeting with our colleague Andrew Andrew</v>

1288
01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:53.640
<v Speaker 2>Robinson today and we said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1289
01:03:53.650 --> 01:03:54.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about this?</v>

1290
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.560
<v Speaker 2>And he was pleased.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1291
01:03:56.590 --> 01:04:01.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if some good has come out of this </v>

1292
01:04:01.590 --> 01:04:04.180
<v Speaker 2>controversy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one of those good things because</v>

1293
01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:07.300
<v Speaker 2>definitely the gendered and sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence policy,</v>

1294
01:04:07.301 --> 01:04:09.550
<v Speaker 2>we haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lori isn't workable.</v>

1295
01:04:09.850 --> 01:04:14.850
<v Speaker 2>It is prejudiced against certain people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and certain ideas and so it needs to be </v>

1296
01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:17.890
<v Speaker 2>reworked because at this is not an </v>
<v Speaker 2>inclusive document.</v>

1297
01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:18.880
<v Speaker 2>It excludes</v>

1298
01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:21.180
<v Speaker 1>and so it needs to be fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a good thing.</v>

1299
01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:27.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's also a canary in the coal mine </v>

1300
01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:27.300
<v Speaker 1>for similar policies at universities all</v>
<v Speaker 1>across Canada.</v>

1301
01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:32.560
<v Speaker 1>We'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe broader because one of one </v>

1302
01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:34.290
<v Speaker 1>thing you'd hope is that the Lindsay </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shepherd affair has produced enough,</v>

1303
01:04:34.291 --> 01:04:39.291
<v Speaker 1>may be negative repercussions to set </v>
<v Speaker 1>people back on their heels a little bit </v>

1304
01:04:39.291 --> 01:04:43.191
<v Speaker 1>and make them dig into these policies </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I can't imagine that there's </v>

1305
01:04:43.191 --> 01:04:46.730
<v Speaker 1>another university in Canada who would </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy partaking in a scandal of </v>

1306
01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:46.860
<v Speaker 1>equivalent magnitude.</v>

1307
01:04:47.770 --> 01:04:50.050
<v Speaker 2>What I would hope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and on that point,</v>

1308
01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:54.490
<v Speaker 2>Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone is a student or if someone is</v>

1309
01:04:54.491 --> 01:04:57.250
<v Speaker 2>a faculty member,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ask for the evidence.</v>

1310
01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:01.240
<v Speaker 2>That's what I've learned from this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of claims out there.</v>

1311
01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:04.060
<v Speaker 2>Mental harm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our campuses become unsafe.</v>

1312
01:05:04.350 --> 01:05:07.020
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ideas that are contained in the,</v>

1313
01:05:07.021 --> 01:05:09.910
<v Speaker 2>the gendered and sexual violence policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying,</v>

1314
01:05:09.911 --> 01:05:14.380
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the evidence that proves this?</v>

1315
01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:17.620
<v Speaker 2>Because this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what a university is to be based</v>

1316
01:05:17.621 --> 01:05:17.830
<v Speaker 2>on</v>

1317
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:21.430
<v Speaker 6>from the enlightenment to today.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We are supposed to be able to say,</v>

1318
01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:26.460
<v Speaker 6>here's the evidence for why we do this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the further we get away from </v>

1319
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:29.500
<v Speaker 6>evidence and the more we embrace </v>
<v Speaker 6>ideology,</v>

1320
01:05:29.650 --> 01:05:32.920
<v Speaker 6>we completely remove what the mission of</v>
<v Speaker 6>a university is supposed to be.</v>

1321
01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:35.710
<v Speaker 6>And the idea of evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we removed the idea of evidence,</v>

1322
01:05:35.711 --> 01:05:39.850
<v Speaker 6>which means we remove the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 6>knowledge because there's no distinction</v>

1323
01:05:39.851 --> 01:05:41.450
<v Speaker 6>between knowledge and evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1324
01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:42.550
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

1325
01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:45.460
<v Speaker 6>so if you are a student and you want to </v>
<v Speaker 6>say,</v>

1326
01:05:45.530 --> 01:05:48.490
<v Speaker 6>what can I do say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's the evidence of mental harm?</v>

1327
01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:50.800
<v Speaker 6>What's the evidence that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that this,</v>

1328
01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:52.980
<v Speaker 6>that I'm transphobic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's the wealth?</v>

1329
01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:58.050
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so partly what you're also saying there </v>

1330
01:05:58.050 --> 01:05:58.300
<v Speaker 6>is a restatement of the old presumption </v>
<v Speaker 6>of innocence idea.</v>

1331
01:05:58.560 --> 01:05:59.590
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

1332
01:05:59.591 --> 01:06:01.810
<v Speaker 6>you're accusing me of something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Prove it.</v>

1333
01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:03.250
<v Speaker 6>I'm innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Adi,</v>

1334
01:06:03.550 --> 01:06:05.260
<v Speaker 6>prove it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Where's your evidence?</v>

1335
01:06:05.550 --> 01:06:06.390
<v Speaker 6>Now I know when we do it.</v>

1336
01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:07.450
<v Speaker 6>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1337
01:06:07.451 --> 01:06:10.810
<v Speaker 6>part of that is tied up with this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with the sexual harassment issue,</v>

1338
01:06:10.811 --> 01:06:12.690
<v Speaker 6>because increasingly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and this is,</v>

1339
01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:17.700
<v Speaker 6>this is this has started,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think most particularly the United </v>

1340
01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:21.450
<v Speaker 6>States,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're moving towards a preponderance of </v>

1341
01:06:21.450 --> 01:06:21.790
<v Speaker 6>evidence standard instead of a </v>
<v Speaker 6>assumption of innocence standard.</v>

1342
01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:26.850
<v Speaker 6>That's especially true with these sexual</v>
<v Speaker 6>harassment policies that are being </v>

1343
01:06:26.850 --> 01:06:30.060
<v Speaker 6>derived by derive from institutions and </v>
<v Speaker 6>administrators concerned with such </v>

1344
01:06:32.351 --> 01:06:35.140
<v Speaker 6>things as the gendered and sexual </v>
<v Speaker 6>violence policy.</v>

1345
01:06:35.350 --> 01:06:40.350
<v Speaker 6>And that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's related to the comment you made </v>

1346
01:06:40.350 --> 01:06:40.930
<v Speaker 6>earlier about the lawyer who wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>allowed to speak right,</v>

1347
01:06:40.931 --> 01:06:44.830
<v Speaker 6>because she had the temerity to offer </v>
<v Speaker 6>someone who is accused of a crime,</v>

1348
01:06:44.831 --> 01:06:46.840
<v Speaker 6>a legal defense,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right when,</v>

1349
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:51.870
<v Speaker 6>when apparently what we were supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 6>do with just assume that the people who </v>

1350
01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:55.891
<v Speaker 6>were making the accusations were right </v>
<v Speaker 6>because they claimed that they were </v>

1351
01:06:55.891 --> 01:06:55.891
<v Speaker 6>wronged.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So and,</v>

1352
01:06:55.891 --> 01:06:56.860
<v Speaker 6>and to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to be,</v>

1353
01:06:57.140 --> 01:06:58.600
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we always have to do our caveats,</v>

1354
01:06:58.601 --> 01:06:58.930
<v Speaker 6>don't we?</v>

1355
01:06:59.170 --> 01:07:04.170
<v Speaker 6>We say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know that we want to protect people </v>

1356
01:07:04.170 --> 01:07:07.060
<v Speaker 6>who are victims like I each of us would </v>
<v Speaker 6>agree,</v>

1357
01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.360
<v Speaker 6>but it can't be done at this sac by </v>
<v Speaker 6>sacrificing truth.</v>

1358
01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:15.420
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't protect people from being </v>

1359
01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:15.420
<v Speaker 6>victimized by undermining the rule of </v>
<v Speaker 6>law.</v>

1360
01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:17.890
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>quite the contrary because ultimately it</v>

1361
01:07:17.891 --> 01:07:19.720
<v Speaker 6>comes back to bite you in the behind.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1362
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:20.860
<v Speaker 6>So that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And very,</v>

1363
01:07:20.861 --> 01:07:22.420
<v Speaker 6>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So.</v>

1364
01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:23.620
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In the interim,</v>

1365
01:07:23.621 --> 01:07:28.621
<v Speaker 6>we will ensure access to the existing </v>
<v Speaker 6>support and complaints procedures by </v>

1366
01:07:28.621 --> 01:07:30.730
<v Speaker 6>providing management and oversight </v>
<v Speaker 6>through the Austin Office of dispute,</v>

1367
01:07:30.731 --> 01:07:33.100
<v Speaker 6>Resolution and support.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1368
01:07:33.101 --> 01:07:34.170
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure what that means.</v>

1369
01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:35.910
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually very good news.</v>

1370
01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:36.630
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1371
01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:38.100
<v Speaker 3>Means that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1372
01:07:38.310 --> 01:07:43.310
<v Speaker 3>the oversight of this is being removed </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the diversity and equity office and</v>

1373
01:07:43.621 --> 01:07:45.870
<v Speaker 3>put under the president's direct </v>
<v Speaker 3>control.</v>

1374
01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:49.320
<v Speaker 3>So she doesn't think that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsible.</v>

1375
01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:52.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm very worried about diversity and</v>

1376
01:07:52.861 --> 01:07:54.040
<v Speaker 3>equity office over</v>

1377
01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:56.610
<v Speaker 6>this suggests that the president should </v>
<v Speaker 6>be,</v>

1378
01:07:56.630 --> 01:08:01.630
<v Speaker 6>it suggests the president is also </v>
<v Speaker 6>worried about the diversity and equity </v>

1379
01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:04.100
<v Speaker 6>office that she has said we're not a </v>
<v Speaker 6>bit,</v>

1380
01:08:04.170 --> 01:08:08.520
<v Speaker 6>but the fact that she has done this is </v>
<v Speaker 6>really a strong sign that,</v>

1381
01:08:08.570 --> 01:08:13.570
<v Speaker 6>that she is aware that that office needs</v>
<v Speaker 6>to be needs to be right or at least that</v>

1382
01:08:14.101 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 6>she's concerned enough the reputation</v>

1383
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:20.980
<v Speaker 1>of the university so that she's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to let the same mistake happen </v>

1384
01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:20.980
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a good thing.</v>

1385
01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:22.250
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't care why she's doing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly,</v>

1386
01:08:22.490 --> 01:08:24.410
<v Speaker 1>but it's a good thing that it is being </v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

1387
01:08:24.411 --> 01:08:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fine.</v>

1388
01:08:25.251 --> 01:08:25.990
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

1389
01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:31.090
<v Speaker 1>that's good news that this has the added</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit of improved accountability as </v>

1390
01:08:31.090 --> 01:08:33.170
<v Speaker 1>that office reports through to me as </v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

1391
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:34.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1392
01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:39.340
<v Speaker 1>Well you can see in those lines that </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's not particularly happy about </v>

1393
01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:42.791
<v Speaker 1>what's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what sort of financial hit </v>

1394
01:08:42.791 --> 01:08:45.011
<v Speaker 1>Wilfrid laurier took because you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that while the donors are going </v>

1395
01:08:45.011 --> 01:08:49.811
<v Speaker 1>to be a lot more conservative than the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the professors and the </v>

1396
01:08:49.811 --> 01:08:49.811
<v Speaker 1>administrators and the students.</v>

1397
01:08:49.811 --> 01:08:50.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a,</v>

1398
01:08:51.090 --> 01:08:54.570
<v Speaker 2>we've been contacted by a group of </v>
<v Speaker 2>alumni who have now organized.</v>

1399
01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:57.320
<v Speaker 2>They haven't yet released what would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

1400
01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:02.360
<v Speaker 2>their press release,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but slowly they've been reaching out to </v>

1401
01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:04.350
<v Speaker 2>other alumni and it's the lorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a alumni for free expression.</v>

1402
01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:09.620
<v Speaker 2>And what they have said is their mandate</v>
<v Speaker 2>is one to withhold all donations until </v>

1403
01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:14.040
<v Speaker 2>laurie a excepts the Loria statement for</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom of expression.</v>

1404
01:09:14.430 --> 01:09:15.870
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1405
01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:19.560
<v Speaker 2>I haven't checked in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just someone acting on her own.</v>

1406
01:09:19.710 --> 01:09:21.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a Lauria alumni.</v>

1407
01:09:22.170 --> 01:09:27.170
<v Speaker 2>She has I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>contacts within the alumni association </v>

1408
01:09:27.170 --> 01:09:29.940
<v Speaker 2>and she just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she sent us some contact information and</v>

1409
01:09:29.941 --> 01:09:31.110
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what I'm doing,</v>

1410
01:09:31.111 --> 01:09:33.930
<v Speaker 2>wanted you to know I support your </v>
<v Speaker 2>efforts and I'm,</v>

1411
01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:36.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm working on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll let you know when I'm ready to go.</v>

1412
01:09:36.691 --> 01:09:37.860
<v Speaker 2>And so that was really encouraging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1413
01:09:37.890 --> 01:09:42.890
<v Speaker 3>I have a colleague who does a survey of </v>
<v Speaker 3>chief financial officers quarterly to </v>

1414
01:09:42.890 --> 01:09:47.351
<v Speaker 3>gauge their optimism about the economy </v>
<v Speaker 3>and started down at Duke and he's </v>

1415
01:09:47.351 --> 01:09:51.091
<v Speaker 3>starting it now for Canada and he got </v>
<v Speaker 3>responses from to a he because he sent </v>

1416
01:09:51.201 --> 01:09:52.670
<v Speaker 3>out an email to shortly after this </v>
<v Speaker 3>broke,</v>

1417
01:09:52.671 --> 01:09:55.460
<v Speaker 3>he got responses from two alumni who </v>
<v Speaker 3>just said,</v>

1418
01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:56.150
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1419
01:09:56.210 --> 01:09:58.100
<v Speaker 3>why should I participate in this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why should I help you?</v>

1420
01:09:58.101 --> 01:09:59.810
<v Speaker 3>This is not so I don't have any respect </v>
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>

1421
01:09:59.930 --> 01:10:01.750
<v Speaker 3>These are alumni of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1422
01:10:01.810 --> 01:10:05.330
<v Speaker 3>of Wilfrid laurier university as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I can imagine too that enrollment is</v>

1423
01:10:05.331 --> 01:10:07.040
<v Speaker 3>going to take a pretty vicious hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1424
01:10:07.041 --> 01:10:10.430
<v Speaker 3>our business school is quite excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a great car program.</v>

1425
01:10:10.431 --> 01:10:11.980
<v Speaker 3>We in the finance area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tech,</v>

1426
01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:16.460
<v Speaker 3>a lot of very strong students and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>compete for top tier students in Ontario</v>

1427
01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:19.870
<v Speaker 3>of the entry average is like 89 or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something and,</v>

1428
01:10:19.871 --> 01:10:20.960
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we really could be for the,</v>

1429
01:10:20.970 --> 01:10:25.970
<v Speaker 3>what we call the high flyers and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can choose any school right in the </v>

1430
01:10:25.970 --> 01:10:26.350
<v Speaker 3>province,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1431
01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1432
01:10:27.071 --> 01:10:32.071
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't take much of a hit to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reputation to give people who have </v>

1433
01:10:32.071 --> 01:10:32.071
<v Speaker 1>options,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason to go elsewhere,</v>

1434
01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:37.110
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you lose the best people and </v>

1435
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.110
<v Speaker 1>that's when things really started</v>

1436
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.660
<v Speaker 2>the fall apart and what you might begin </v>
<v Speaker 2>to see.</v>

1437
01:10:37.661 --> 01:10:40.160
<v Speaker 2>And I would say that this is something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that uh,</v>

1438
01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:45.240
<v Speaker 2>the general public might look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch what happens to the entrance </v>

1439
01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.750
<v Speaker 2>averages in the arts and humanities that</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1440
01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:48.670
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we might not take a hit,</v>

1441
01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:54.540
<v Speaker 2>but let's see if the average is take a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hit because suddenly and currently the </v>

1442
01:10:55.031 --> 01:10:59.440
<v Speaker 2>entrance average to get into our general</v>
<v Speaker 2>arts program in communications.</v>

1443
01:10:59.441 --> 01:11:04.441
<v Speaker 2>Let's just talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Communications is mid seventies with an </v>

1444
01:11:04.441 --> 01:11:06.520
<v Speaker 2>average of 60 in English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1445
01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:07.510
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1446
01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:08.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1447
01:11:09.190 --> 01:11:09.580
<v Speaker 2>basically</v>

1448
01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:12.840
<v Speaker 1>a failing grade because I'm just few </v>
<v Speaker 1>handy in the NASA.</v>

1449
01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:13.950
<v Speaker 1>In high school</v>

1450
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:16.210
<v Speaker 6>you'll get 60 you really well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1451
01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:21.230
<v Speaker 6>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's basically the grading basically </v>

1452
01:11:21.230 --> 01:11:21.230
<v Speaker 6>runs from 60,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it goes zero.</v>

1453
01:11:21.230 --> 01:11:23.910
<v Speaker 6>You didn't hand it in 60 to 100.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You handed it in.</v>

1454
01:11:24.210 --> 01:11:29.210
<v Speaker 6>And let's keep in mind that the tutorial</v>
<v Speaker 6>that Lindsay was running was a grammar </v>

1455
01:11:29.210 --> 01:11:34.161
<v Speaker 6>tutorial.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The content of which looked a lot like </v>

1456
01:11:34.161 --> 01:11:34.161
<v Speaker 6>grade six curriculum.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1457
01:11:34.161 --> 01:11:39.140
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well that gets us into a discussion of </v>

1458
01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:39.140
<v Speaker 6>the schools in general,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we're all ready.</v>

1459
01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:43.440
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm thinking that maybe it's not a good </v>

1460
01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:43.680
<v Speaker 6>idea to lower standards any anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right,</v>

1461
01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:44.720
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

1462
01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:45.870
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1463
01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:50.960
<v Speaker 6>So academic freedom and freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 6>expression for those who have chosen to </v>

1464
01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:55.140
<v Speaker 6>use this incident as an indictment of </v>
<v Speaker 6>Wilfrid laurier university or the plight</v>

1465
01:11:55.141 --> 01:11:59.490
<v Speaker 6>of Canadian universities in general,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I say your assertion is unreasonable and</v>

1466
01:11:59.491 --> 01:12:00.330
<v Speaker 6>unfounded.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1467
01:12:00.331 --> 01:12:01.740
<v Speaker 6>we better stop this interview.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1468
01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:02.430
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1469
01:12:02.650 --> 01:12:04.200
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can say that all you want.</v>

1470
01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:04.700
<v Speaker 6>I.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1471
01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:09.800
<v Speaker 6>I would say instead that what happened </v>
<v Speaker 6>at Wilfrid laurier is a precise </v>

1472
01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:13.851
<v Speaker 6>manifestation of exactly the sort of rot</v>
<v Speaker 6>that both produced bill [inaudible] and </v>

1473
01:12:13.851 --> 01:12:18.591
<v Speaker 6>that I was warning about last September.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so I don't think the assertion is </v>

1474
01:12:18.591 --> 01:12:21.180
<v Speaker 6>unreasonable in an unfounded at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And here's one piece of data.</v>

1475
01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:25.350
<v Speaker 6>Eighty percent of humanities papers are </v>
<v Speaker 6>not sighted once,</v>

1476
01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:29.420
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so.</v>

1477
01:12:29.450 --> 01:12:31.500
<v Speaker 6>So let's just translate that for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>viewing public.</v>

1478
01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:36.560
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That means that they're producing </v>

1479
01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.300
<v Speaker 6>scholarship that nobody looks at that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that even their friends don't look at.</v>

1480
01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:39.420
<v Speaker 6>And because,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

1481
01:12:39.421 --> 01:12:44.421
<v Speaker 6>so what a citation is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is I read someone's paper and I find a </v>

1482
01:12:44.421 --> 01:12:45.090
<v Speaker 6>good idea in it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then I use that idea to buttress and</v>

1483
01:12:45.091 --> 01:12:46.530
<v Speaker 6>idea of my own or to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or to,</v>

1484
01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:48.780
<v Speaker 6>or to riff off or to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or to,</v>

1485
01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:52.560
<v Speaker 6>or to criticize even for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then I cite them,</v>

1486
01:12:52.561 --> 01:12:54.300
<v Speaker 6>I say who they were and when they </v>
<v Speaker 6>published it.</v>

1487
01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:57.690
<v Speaker 6>And then the paper,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the size that there's a huge bureaucracy</v>

1488
01:12:57.691 --> 01:13:02.691
<v Speaker 6>that keeps track of citations and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 6>major indication of academic ability to </v>

1489
01:13:02.691 --> 01:13:02.910
<v Speaker 6>be cited,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1490
01:13:02.911 --> 01:13:03.390
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1491
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:08.510
<v Speaker 6>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like it's academic payment to be </v>

1492
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:08.510
<v Speaker 6>cited.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1493
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:11.640
<v Speaker 6>So 80 percent of humanities papers don't</v>
<v Speaker 6>get cited once.</v>

1494
01:13:12.330 --> 01:13:15.300
<v Speaker 6>It's absolute failures,</v>
<v Speaker 6>absolute failure as a game.</v>

1495
01:13:15.301 --> 01:13:17.990
<v Speaker 6>If someone wanted to play a game,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1496
01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:23.020
<v Speaker 6>I would suggest that they go and they </v>
<v Speaker 6>look at the publications of the </v>

1497
01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:27.330
<v Speaker 6>professors in a particular area and see </v>
<v Speaker 6>if the titles all sound the same.</v>

1498
01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:31.770
<v Speaker 6>And if they all say something about </v>
<v Speaker 6>intersectionality,</v>

1499
01:13:32.370 --> 01:13:36.840
<v Speaker 6>a colonialism and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and these other various,</v>

1500
01:13:36.890 --> 01:13:39.750
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>social justice words,</v>

1501
01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:43.050
<v Speaker 6>you might wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 6>am I going to get taught the same course</v>

1502
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:43.920
<v Speaker 6>again?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And again,</v>

1503
01:13:43.921 --> 01:13:47.610
<v Speaker 6>by every professor in this program,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because it seems to me that all of their</v>

1504
01:13:47.611 --> 01:13:49.290
<v Speaker 6>research is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is very similar.</v>

1505
01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:50.700
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

1506
01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:55.760
<v Speaker 6>and how can that be when there's such a </v>
<v Speaker 6>broad base of knowledge and the world </v>

1507
01:13:55.830 --> 01:14:00.150
<v Speaker 6>that we can have such similarity between</v>
<v Speaker 6>every publication,</v>

1508
01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:01.920
<v Speaker 6>which then goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>

1509
01:14:01.921 --> 01:14:05.730
<v Speaker 6>Why do I need to read my colleague stuff</v>
<v Speaker 6>when it's exactly like my own,</v>

1510
01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:07.800
<v Speaker 6>which,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which we see.</v>

1511
01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:10.370
<v Speaker 6>So just just as a baseline Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how many,</v>

1512
01:14:10.670 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 6>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what would you say</v>

1513
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:17.100
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is someone who is doing some good </v>

1514
01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:17.100
<v Speaker 1>research?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>

1515
01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:17.650
<v Speaker 1>how many citations would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would they be receiving?</v>

1516
01:14:17.651 --> 01:14:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Maybe collectively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>

1517
01:14:19.941 --> 01:14:21.160
<v Speaker 1>what are we looking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thousands.</v>

1518
01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:21.940
<v Speaker 1>Thousands?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1519
01:14:21.941 --> 01:14:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Well a good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>

1520
01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:29.040
<v Speaker 1>if you write a good paper then like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great paypal,</v>

1521
01:14:29.490 --> 01:14:31.480
<v Speaker 1>paypal will get you 100 citations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1522
01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:34.520
<v Speaker 1>An outstanding overwhelmingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>outstanding pay.</v>

1523
01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:37.220
<v Speaker 1>I'll get you a thousand citations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1524
01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.760
<v Speaker 1>10 isn't none.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1525
01:14:39.770 --> 01:14:44.470
<v Speaker 1>if you register with 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but zero is that failure.</v>

1526
01:14:45.010 --> 01:14:50.010
<v Speaker 1>It means your work had zero impact it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means your work wasn't worth the </v>

1527
01:14:50.010 --> 01:14:50.780
<v Speaker 1>paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was published on this.</v>

1528
01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:55.800
<v Speaker 1>This brings us to a kind of interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>little issue with regards to the rot in </v>

1529
01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:56.440
<v Speaker 1>the universities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

1530
01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:58.630
<v Speaker 1>which Deborah mccloud she says does not </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>

1531
01:14:58.631 --> 01:15:01.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's how the game works is that we set</v>

1532
01:15:01.541 --> 01:15:04.270
<v Speaker 1>up a little ideological garden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1533
01:15:04.271 --> 01:15:09.271
<v Speaker 1>The 10 of us play in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we all publish in the same </v>

1534
01:15:09.271 --> 01:15:11.380
<v Speaker 1>journal and we peer review each other's </v>
<v Speaker 1>articles and we just published them.</v>

1535
01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:14.200
<v Speaker 1>There's no critique or very little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

1536
01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:18.790
<v Speaker 1>the barrier for publication is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very low when it should be very high,</v>

1537
01:15:18.791 --> 01:15:21.400
<v Speaker 1>like a good journal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good journal will reject.</v>

1538
01:15:21.401 --> 01:15:23.530
<v Speaker 1>Ninety percent of the papers that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1539
01:15:23.650 --> 01:15:24.060
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

1540
01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:25.120
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

1541
01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:26.950
<v Speaker 1>are submitted to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1542
01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:32.190
<v Speaker 1>So rejection rates really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question is why do the papers get</v>

1543
01:15:35.441 --> 01:15:38.770
<v Speaker 1>published since no one reads them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have nothing to offer.</v>

1544
01:15:38.771 --> 01:15:40.480
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>straightforward.</v>

1545
01:15:41.410 --> 01:15:46.410
<v Speaker 1>The journals are extremely expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are way more expensive than they should </v>

1546
01:15:46.410 --> 01:15:47.830
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just to buy a single paper online for</v>

1547
01:15:47.831 --> 01:15:51.160
<v Speaker 1>the ordinary person is like $40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is more than a hardcover book.</v>

1548
01:15:51.161 --> 01:15:53.050
<v Speaker 1>That's just a download,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the PDF.</v>

1549
01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:55.900
<v Speaker 1>And so the journal itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the libraries are full of them,</v>

1550
01:15:55.901 --> 01:16:00.901
<v Speaker 1>are very expensive and the subscriptions</v>
<v Speaker 1>are very expensive and so what happens </v>

1551
01:16:00.901 --> 01:16:04.681
<v Speaker 1>is the professors pressure the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university libraries to by the journals </v>

1552
01:16:04.681 --> 01:16:08.860
<v Speaker 1>and the library funds the publisher and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so the publishers will publish anything.</v>

1553
01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Routledge is a good example of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much to my chagrin because they </v>

1554
01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:15.190
<v Speaker 1>published my first book but and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be a great publishing house,</v>

1555
01:16:15.191 --> 01:16:20.191
<v Speaker 1>but they'll publish damn near anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is that the </v>

1556
01:16:20.191 --> 01:16:22.921
<v Speaker 1>libraries are forced to pay radically </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflated prices for the publications </v>

1557
01:16:23.501 --> 01:16:28.501
<v Speaker 1>that no one ever reads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so people right to publish in </v>

1558
01:16:28.501 --> 01:16:32.641
<v Speaker 1>journals that libraries have to purchase</v>
<v Speaker 1>at inflated prices to produce knowledge </v>

1559
01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:38.340
<v Speaker 1>that no one will ever read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the little scandal that </v>

1560
01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:42.030
<v Speaker 1>plagues the humanities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it characterizes the humanities </v>

1561
01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:44.941
<v Speaker 1>more than plagues them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that there's no systemic </v>

1562
01:16:44.941 --> 01:16:45.070
<v Speaker 1>rot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say in the universities,</v>

1563
01:16:45.071 --> 01:16:46.770
<v Speaker 1>especially in the humanities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is just not right.</v>

1564
01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:49.610
<v Speaker 3>This is just far too general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There.</v>

1565
01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:54.150
<v Speaker 3>There is rot and it's not everywhere and</v>
<v Speaker 3>this just reveals that.</v>

1566
01:16:54.151 --> 01:16:57.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't think she's that familiar with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the situation.</v>

1567
01:16:57.001 --> 01:17:02.001
<v Speaker 3>She's in and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've been listening to some of your </v>

1568
01:17:02.001 --> 01:17:03.450
<v Speaker 3>work and Jonathan Haidt trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand what's been going on over the</v>

1569
01:17:03.451 --> 01:17:08.451
<v Speaker 3>last two years in universities protected</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I am in a business school and </v>

1570
01:17:08.451 --> 01:17:10.220
<v Speaker 3>starting to realize that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

1571
01:17:10.230 --> 01:17:14.300
<v Speaker 6>It's social justice perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fields are fine so far.</v>

1572
01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:16.040
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the business schools,</v>

1573
01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:18.830
<v Speaker 6>although there are moves into the </v>
<v Speaker 6>business schools,</v>

1574
01:17:18.831 --> 01:17:22.040
<v Speaker 6>but they're still doing all right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Philosophy is not doing too badly.</v>

1575
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:27.070
<v Speaker 6>Like there are disciplines that have </v>
<v Speaker 6>still remained untouched and mostly </v>

1576
01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:31.361
<v Speaker 6>what's happened so far is that if the </v>
<v Speaker 6>discipline has a strong economic or </v>

1577
01:17:31.361 --> 01:17:35.621
<v Speaker 6>scientific footing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's proved much harder to corrupt and </v>

1578
01:17:35.621 --> 01:17:38.830
<v Speaker 6>empirical for my part.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I play in the playground of sociology</v>

1579
01:17:39.021 --> 01:17:40.610
<v Speaker 6>of religion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but all my stuff,</v>

1580
01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:43.250
<v Speaker 6>well most of my stuff is quantitative so</v>
<v Speaker 6>I actually,</v>

1581
01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:45.790
<v Speaker 6>I wasn't familiar with what was going </v>
<v Speaker 6>on.</v>

1582
01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:50.980
<v Speaker 6>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I go to conferences where everybody has </v>

1583
01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:53.741
<v Speaker 6>to have strong empirical evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I publish in journals that are </v>

1584
01:17:53.741 --> 01:17:56.801
<v Speaker 6>international journals that are the </v>
<v Speaker 6>scientific study of religion is what we </v>

1585
01:17:57.021 --> 01:17:58.160
<v Speaker 6>do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

1586
01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:03.360
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm familiar with food co and that </v>

1587
01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:03.360
<v Speaker 6>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's not where I play,</v>

1588
01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:07.300
<v Speaker 6>so I wasn't really exposed to what's </v>
<v Speaker 6>going on and you don't and you don't </v>

1589
01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:07.300
<v Speaker 6>really think.</v>

1590
01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:09.430
<v Speaker 6>Well they kept no reason to be that </v>
<v Speaker 6>concerned about it.</v>

1591
01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:15.390
<v Speaker 6>Well this is it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but then I'm trying to get into the </v>

1592
01:18:15.390 --> 01:18:17.280
<v Speaker 6>headspace of some of my colleagues.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I got out of text book,</v>

1593
01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:19.750
<v Speaker 6>it was called race class and gender and </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1594
01:18:19.770 --> 01:18:24.770
<v Speaker 6>it's an anthology that's used in </v>
<v Speaker 6>cultural studies courses in women's </v>

1595
01:18:24.770 --> 01:18:26.810
<v Speaker 6>studies courses and it sorta the Goto </v>
<v Speaker 6>text.</v>

1596
01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:31.840
<v Speaker 6>So I'm told and I'm reading it and I </v>
<v Speaker 6>turned it and I turn to page 14 and I </v>

1597
01:18:32.091 --> 01:18:37.091
<v Speaker 6>can tell you it's page 14 because I was </v>
<v Speaker 6>so astounded by what I found and it </v>

1598
01:18:37.091 --> 01:18:37.440
<v Speaker 6>said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1599
01:18:37.670 --> 01:18:38.600
<v Speaker 6>we the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1600
01:18:38.601 --> 01:18:43.601
<v Speaker 6>it says objectivity as found through </v>
<v Speaker 6>rational thought is a western and </v>

1601
01:18:44.331 --> 01:18:48.230
<v Speaker 6>masculine concept that we will challenge</v>
<v Speaker 6>throughout this text.</v>

1602
01:18:48.260 --> 01:18:48.710
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

1603
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.790
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1604
01:18:49.791 --> 01:18:53.420
<v Speaker 6>And I said it's too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's too bad that you're shocked by that</v>

1605
01:18:53.630 --> 01:18:58.630
<v Speaker 6>because the want to go for irrational pc</v>
<v Speaker 6>types have been saying exactly that </v>

1606
01:18:58.731 --> 01:18:59.960
<v Speaker 6>since the 19 seventies.</v>

1607
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:02.720
<v Speaker 6>Like that is exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Make no mistake about it.</v>

1608
01:19:02.721 --> 01:19:05.090
<v Speaker 6>This is why mcclachi is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This isn't,</v>

1609
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:07.310
<v Speaker 6>this isn't something they're secreting </v>
<v Speaker 6>in.</v>

1610
01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:09.860
<v Speaker 6>This is the dead statement.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

1611
01:19:09.861 --> 01:19:11.180
<v Speaker 6>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1612
01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:16.590
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the whole notion of logic and coherence </v>

1613
01:19:16.590 --> 01:19:19.010
<v Speaker 6>and empirical data for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The evidence.</v>

1614
01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:24.430
<v Speaker 6>Let's question,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's question the definition of </v>

1615
01:19:24.430 --> 01:19:26.891
<v Speaker 6>evidence because the underlying idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Remember the underlying idea here is </v>

1616
01:19:26.891 --> 01:19:28.610
<v Speaker 6>that all hierarchies are predicated on </v>
<v Speaker 6>power.</v>

1617
01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:32.900
<v Speaker 6>So if the reason that I put forward </v>
<v Speaker 6>something as evidence isn't because it's</v>

1618
01:19:32.901 --> 01:19:37.901
<v Speaker 6>evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's because it's evidenced that I get </v>

1619
01:19:37.901 --> 01:19:39.110
<v Speaker 6>to have that position of power.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so if you're a postmodernist and you</v>

1620
01:19:39.111 --> 01:19:39.440
<v Speaker 6>say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1621
01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:44.441
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to question your evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what you think you're saying is you're </v>

1622
01:19:44.441 --> 01:19:45.860
<v Speaker 6>going to question my claim to that </v>
<v Speaker 6>arbitrary power.</v>

1623
01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:49.670
<v Speaker 6>The whole idea that there's evidence </v>
<v Speaker 6>outside of claims of arbitrary power.</v>

1624
01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:52.520
<v Speaker 6>The postmodernist dispensed without the </v>
<v Speaker 6>19 seventies.</v>

1625
01:19:52.670 --> 01:19:57.670
<v Speaker 6>That's Derrida.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's exactly what he said in all this </v>

1626
01:19:57.670 --> 01:20:01.811
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've been trying to get samples of </v>

1627
01:20:01.811 --> 01:20:01.811
<v Speaker 6>thousands so that I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1628
01:20:01.811 --> 01:20:02.960
<v Speaker 6>this is a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We can say something,</v>

1629
01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:04.480
<v Speaker 6>God just in generalized.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1630
01:20:04.481 --> 01:20:09.481
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That just demonstrates how thoroughly </v>

1631
01:20:09.481 --> 01:20:09.481
<v Speaker 6>entrenched you are in the reining </v>
<v Speaker 6>patriarchal ideology,</v>

1632
01:20:09.481 --> 01:20:14.151
<v Speaker 6>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I was just hoping to get beyond </v>

1633
01:20:14.151 --> 01:20:14.151
<v Speaker 6>anecdotal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no beyond that.</v>

1634
01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:16.770
<v Speaker 6>There's no beyond anecdotal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's become a methodology.</v>

1635
01:20:16.771 --> 01:20:21.771
<v Speaker 6>That's odd.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's called auto ethnography is a </v>

1636
01:20:21.771 --> 01:20:25.671
<v Speaker 6>technical term for it and auto </v>
<v Speaker 6>ethnography is the publication of a </v>

1637
01:20:25.671 --> 01:20:29.901
<v Speaker 6>journey of a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of a private diary essentially in a </v>

1638
01:20:29.901 --> 01:20:34.460
<v Speaker 6>hypothetically reputable,</v>
<v Speaker 6>reputable academic journal.</v>

1639
01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:41.480
<v Speaker 6>It's only because of in the last three </v>
<v Speaker 6>or four years that these things have </v>

1640
01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:41.480
<v Speaker 6>been happening and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1641
01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:42.030
<v Speaker 6>where?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Where do they get this?</v>

1642
01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:45.690
<v Speaker 6>How do they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how do they find these thoughts?</v>

1643
01:20:45.930 --> 01:20:46.410
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1644
01:20:46.411 --> 01:20:47.040
<v Speaker 6>we don't.</v>

1645
01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:49.560
<v Speaker 6>We don't want to fall into the mistake </v>
<v Speaker 6>of making,</v>

1646
01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:52.710
<v Speaker 6>of making the assumption that this </v>
<v Speaker 6>hasn't been thought through.</v>

1647
01:20:53.490 --> 01:20:56.670
<v Speaker 6>People are just misunderstanding what </v>
<v Speaker 6>evidence is.</v>

1648
01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:02.000
<v Speaker 6>That isn't what's happening at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When they say they want to question the </v>

1649
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.241
<v Speaker 6>definition of evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's exactly what they mean when they </v>

1650
01:21:05.241 --> 01:21:05.241
<v Speaker 6>say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we want a question,</v>

1651
01:21:05.241 --> 01:21:10.160
<v Speaker 6>the definition of evidence because the </v>
<v Speaker 6>definition of evidence currently </v>

1652
01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:12.030
<v Speaker 6>supports the scientific power structure </v>
<v Speaker 6>in chemistry say,</v>

1653
01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:14.430
<v Speaker 6>and that's fundamentally dominated by,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's say,</v>

1654
01:21:14.431 --> 01:21:19.431
<v Speaker 6>white men.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We can go after the definition of </v>

1655
01:21:19.431 --> 01:21:19.530
<v Speaker 6>evidence itself and that's how we're </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to bring it down,</v>

1656
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:24.830
<v Speaker 6>and so the next on the hit list are </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to be the biologists that are </v>

1657
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:27.000
<v Speaker 6>already under attack from the paper.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It said that mathematics is whiteness.</v>

1658
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.560
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1659
01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:28.790
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Definitely.</v>

1660
01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:32.280
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know that mathematics could </v>
<v Speaker 6>have a race.</v>

1661
01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:38.020
<v Speaker 6>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Thinking the thing is there's nothing </v>

1662
01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:38.020
<v Speaker 6>logical about these claims.</v>

1663
01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:40.260
<v Speaker 6>Once you accept this central axioms,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the axioms are straightforward.</v>

1664
01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:43.740
<v Speaker 6>The world is a battleground of power </v>
<v Speaker 6>hierarchies.</v>

1665
01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:49.100
<v Speaker 6>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There isn't anything else outside of </v>

1666
01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:51.891
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and each power hierarchy generates its </v>

1667
01:21:51.891 --> 01:21:55.281
<v Speaker 6>own internal narrative including rules </v>
<v Speaker 6>for what constitutes evidence that </v>

1668
01:21:56.731 --> 01:22:01.731
<v Speaker 6>support and buttress the structure of </v>
<v Speaker 6>that hierarchy and because the </v>

1669
01:22:01.741 --> 01:22:06.741
<v Speaker 6>hierarchy's exclude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then it's in the best interests of the </v>

1670
01:22:06.741 --> 01:22:08.340
<v Speaker 6>people who are excluded to invert the </v>
<v Speaker 6>hierarchy and of course they also regard</v>

1671
01:22:08.341 --> 01:22:12.510
<v Speaker 6>that as just even though that's part of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the incoherence of the entire argument,</v>

1672
01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:14.520
<v Speaker 6>that's where they have to turn to to </v>
<v Speaker 6>Marxism,</v>

1673
01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:17.340
<v Speaker 6>but make no mistake about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This isn't.</v>

1674
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:18.780
<v Speaker 6>This isn't accidental.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It isn't.</v>

1675
01:22:18.781 --> 01:22:21.360
<v Speaker 6>People misunderstanding what constitutes</v>
<v Speaker 6>evidence.</v>

1676
01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:22.650
<v Speaker 6>Not at all.</v>

1677
01:22:22.770 --> 01:22:27.770
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been listening to some of your </v>

1678
01:22:27.770 --> 01:22:28.890
<v Speaker 3>lectures on this for the last year and </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking you sound a little deranged.</v>

1679
01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:31.350
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1680
01:22:31.351 --> 01:22:34.290
<v Speaker 6>I might be a little deranged deranged </v>
<v Speaker 6>about this.</v>

1681
01:22:34.970 --> 01:22:39.970
<v Speaker 3>And then this whole episode with Lindsay</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shepherd just proves that in every </v>

1682
01:22:39.970 --> 01:22:42.170
<v Speaker 3>dimension of this is about power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1683
01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:43.650
<v Speaker 3>the double speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1684
01:22:43.651 --> 01:22:46.910
<v Speaker 3>the changing of terminology from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>expulsion.</v>

1685
01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:49.880
<v Speaker 3>People's ideas could be violent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The circling,</v>

1686
01:22:49.881 --> 01:22:51.920
<v Speaker 3>the sacred,</v>
<v Speaker 3>circling around the victim group.</v>

1687
01:22:52.190 --> 01:22:52.530
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look</v>

1688
01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:58.040
<v Speaker 6>what happened at Wilfrid laurier.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One of the things that were so bloody </v>

1689
01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:00.811
<v Speaker 6>interesting that I thought was just </v>
<v Speaker 6>fascinating was the unbelievably </v>

1690
01:23:01.090 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 6>strategic attempt to transform shepherd </v>
<v Speaker 6>into perpetrator and</v>

1691
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:10.980
<v Speaker 4>Rambo Kana and pim law into the victims,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially Rocana as a professor of </v>

1692
01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:10.980
<v Speaker 4>color.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1693
01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:12.640
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what happens,</v>

1694
01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:15.340
<v Speaker 4>the reverse narrative was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1695
01:23:15.341 --> 01:23:18.850
<v Speaker 4>Lindsay shepherd was using something </v>
<v Speaker 4>like her white privilege and their white</v>

1696
01:23:18.851 --> 01:23:23.710
<v Speaker 4>tiers to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to harass a poor professor of color.</v>

1697
01:23:23.711 --> 01:23:26.280
<v Speaker 4>Untenured professor of color.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1698
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:30.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that there was every attempt made on</v>

1699
01:23:30.161 --> 01:23:35.161
<v Speaker 4>the part of the people who are going </v>
<v Speaker 4>after shepherd to make that the </v>

1700
01:23:35.161 --> 01:23:35.161
<v Speaker 4>narrative.</v>

1701
01:23:35.161 --> 01:23:35.161
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1702
01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:40.280
<v Speaker 3>in the they started accusing everyone of</v>
<v Speaker 3>being trans phobic just right out of the</v>

1703
01:23:40.481 --> 01:23:41.920
<v Speaker 3>blocks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Within days of this,</v>

1704
01:23:41.921 --> 01:23:43.840
<v Speaker 3>we were all tired without epithet.</v>

1705
01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:49.640
<v Speaker 2>Immediately labels have been just flying</v>
<v Speaker 2>and without any regard to the intent of </v>

1706
01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:50.390
<v Speaker 2>the person or even the content.</v>

1707
01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:53.310
<v Speaker 4>Here's something interesting about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>transphobia issue too,</v>

1708
01:23:53.460 --> 01:23:58.460
<v Speaker 4>so I've had at least now a number of </v>
<v Speaker 4>discussions with trans people by the </v>

1709
01:23:58.460 --> 01:24:03.111
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also a number of letters from trans </v>

1710
01:24:03.111 --> 01:24:03.111
<v Speaker 4>people over the last year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about 40 of them as a matter of fact,</v>

1711
01:24:03.111 --> 01:24:07.851
<v Speaker 4>which is a lot of letters because there </v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't that many trans people and every </v>

1712
01:24:07.851 --> 01:24:11.691
<v Speaker 4>single one of them I think I got one </v>
<v Speaker 4>letter from a trans person who wasn't </v>

1713
01:24:11.691 --> 01:24:15.201
<v Speaker 4>happy with what I was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but every single one of the other </v>

1714
01:24:15.201 --> 01:24:18.171
<v Speaker 4>letters said the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We are sick and tired of being the </v>

1715
01:24:18.171 --> 01:24:21.621
<v Speaker 4>poster child for these activists who </v>
<v Speaker 4>claim to speak in our name because </v>

1716
01:24:21.621 --> 01:24:25.791
<v Speaker 4>that's another thing that we should be </v>
<v Speaker 4>very aware of is just because an </v>

1717
01:24:25.791 --> 01:24:28.371
<v Speaker 4>activist comes out and says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a member of this minority group and </v>

1718
01:24:28.371 --> 01:24:32.181
<v Speaker 4>therefore I speak for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the first time it might be </v>

1719
01:24:32.181 --> 01:24:35.331
<v Speaker 4>true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the second claim is not only just </v>

1720
01:24:35.331 --> 01:24:35.331
<v Speaker 4>unjustifiable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's actually,</v>

1721
01:24:35.331 --> 01:24:38.680
<v Speaker 4>I would say it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not racist exactly,</v>

1722
01:24:38.681 --> 01:24:43.681
<v Speaker 4>but it's groups just because it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>predicated on the assumption that just </v>

1723
01:24:43.681 --> 01:24:45.100
<v Speaker 4>because you happen to be the member of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>class,</v>

1724
01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:48.250
<v Speaker 4>that you're a representative member of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that class,</v>

1725
01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:53.280
<v Speaker 4>that class is so homogenous that </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone in it is the same enough so </v>

1726
01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:57.631
<v Speaker 4>that all the members within it can speak</v>
<v Speaker 4>for all the other members used to call </v>

1727
01:24:57.631 --> 01:24:58.660
<v Speaker 4>that racism when it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it applied to racial category.</v>

1728
01:24:58.910 --> 01:25:03.910
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Lindsay has been very good to point </v>

1729
01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:06.661
<v Speaker 2>out and so if some of the media that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there have been a transgendered students</v>

1730
01:25:07.001 --> 01:25:12.001
<v Speaker 2>at Laurie who have spoken out in support</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Lindsay and we have to keep this in </v>

1731
01:25:12.161 --> 01:25:14.350
<v Speaker 2>mind that this is not a transgendered </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>

1732
01:25:14.530 --> 01:25:19.530
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and neither was my comments on bill </v>

1733
01:25:19.530 --> 01:25:22.800
<v Speaker 2>because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all I know that Lindsey,</v>

1734
01:25:23.381 --> 01:25:26.260
<v Speaker 2>as she even said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she is not transphobic.</v>

1735
01:25:26.350 --> 01:25:29.020
<v Speaker 2>She supports the rights of transgendered</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1736
01:25:29.050 --> 01:25:31.660
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's unequivocal in that.</v>

1737
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:32.590
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1738
01:25:32.670 --> 01:25:35.230
<v Speaker 2>and I think that that's just cover story</v>
<v Speaker 2>her for her.</v>

1739
01:25:35.231 --> 01:25:36.640
<v Speaker 2>True,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right beliefs,</v>

1740
01:25:37.670 --> 01:25:42.670
<v Speaker 2>and there are transgendered students who</v>
<v Speaker 2>have come to her support and at great </v>

1741
01:25:42.670 --> 01:25:45.340
<v Speaker 2>personal cost to themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like those are some brave people.</v>

1742
01:25:45.341 --> 01:25:50.341
<v Speaker 2>They're right there to break with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>group that the hostility in that group </v>

1743
01:25:50.341 --> 01:25:52.900
<v Speaker 2>is real in the activist end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>

1744
01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:54.440
<v Speaker 2>You Bet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Bet.</v>

1745
01:25:54.441 --> 01:25:54.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're</v>

1746
01:25:54.650 --> 01:25:59.650
<v Speaker 3>so quick to take over this issue as </v>
<v Speaker 3>their own and claim that the,</v>

1747
01:26:01.471 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 3>the debate itself was and</v>

1748
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:09.010
<v Speaker 4>that it was just cover for this </v>
<v Speaker 4>transphobic climate that existed and it </v>

1749
01:26:09.301 --> 01:26:11.570
<v Speaker 4>has nothing to do with transgender </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1750
01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:14.910
<v Speaker 4>It's funny too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You saw the same thing with um,</v>

1751
01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:20.200
<v Speaker 4>Rinaldo Walcott when he was on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>director of the women's in diversity </v>

1752
01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:20.810
<v Speaker 4>women's and gender studies at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the,</v>

1753
01:26:20.910 --> 01:26:21.900
<v Speaker 4>at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at,</v>

1754
01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:26.910
<v Speaker 4>at the University of Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He claimed that he claimed like four </v>

1755
01:26:26.910 --> 01:26:30.251
<v Speaker 4>times in that interview that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>University of Toronto was a white </v>

1756
01:26:30.251 --> 01:26:33.191
<v Speaker 4>supremacist organization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I thought I just don't know what to </v>

1757
01:26:33.191 --> 01:26:36.761
<v Speaker 4>make of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I traveled down to my office about </v>

1758
01:26:36.761 --> 01:26:36.780
<v Speaker 4>a week after that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1759
01:26:37.250 --> 01:26:42.250
<v Speaker 4>that interview and I happened by some </v>
<v Speaker 4>students who were standing outside </v>

1760
01:26:42.250 --> 01:26:44.960
<v Speaker 4>waiting to write an exam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's about 100 of them may,</v>

1761
01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:48.920
<v Speaker 4>and like this is particularly true at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the University of Toronto.</v>

1762
01:26:48.921 --> 01:26:50.060
<v Speaker 4>I would say that</v>

1763
01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:56.960
<v Speaker 6>you couldn't look at that group of </v>
<v Speaker 6>students for more than two seconds and </v>

1764
01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:58.030
<v Speaker 6>think that that was a white supremacist </v>
<v Speaker 6>organization.</v>

1765
01:26:58.290 --> 01:27:03.290
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's so ethnically diverse.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you think that the University of </v>

1766
01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:07.030
<v Speaker 6>Toronto is a white supremacist </v>
<v Speaker 6>organization,</v>

1767
01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:12.600
<v Speaker 6>then what that essentially means is that</v>
<v Speaker 6>the most tolerant institution in the </v>

1768
01:27:12.941 --> 01:27:17.620
<v Speaker 6>most tolerant city in the most tolerant </v>
<v Speaker 6>province in the most tolerant country in</v>

1769
01:27:17.621 --> 01:27:21.550
<v Speaker 6>the world is white supremacist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's like,</v>

1770
01:27:22.850 --> 01:27:25.940
<v Speaker 6>well then I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

1771
01:27:26.090 --> 01:27:28.820
<v Speaker 6>I don't even know what you could.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Especially when you say that,</v>

1772
01:27:28.821 --> 01:27:33.821
<v Speaker 6>as someone who's a full professor,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if he's a full professor </v>

1773
01:27:34.370 --> 01:27:36.680
<v Speaker 6>who's a professor at that institute.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

1774
01:27:36.710 --> 01:27:41.710
<v Speaker 6>where's your evidence for this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That same professor was using racial </v>

1775
01:27:41.710 --> 01:27:44.800
<v Speaker 6>slurs against Lindsay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yes.</v>

1776
01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:48.380
<v Speaker 6>The white tiers thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're also misogynistic,</v>

1777
01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:50.420
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because it's white girl tears.</v>

1778
01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:53.090
<v Speaker 6>I could never ever</v>

1779
01:27:54.570 --> 01:27:58.470
<v Speaker 6>do something like that to any student of</v>
<v Speaker 6>any race.</v>

1780
01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:03.680
<v Speaker 6>I just don't understand how the people </v>
<v Speaker 6>on the far left can rationalize that </v>

1781
01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:04.240
<v Speaker 6>kind of behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It,</v>

1782
01:28:04.370 --> 01:28:09.370
<v Speaker 6>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's so they can rationalize it with </v>

1783
01:28:09.370 --> 01:28:10.590
<v Speaker 6>power,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but in terms of civility,</v>

1784
01:28:10.591 --> 01:28:14.370
<v Speaker 6>just incivility in recognizing the </v>
<v Speaker 6>humanity in every person.</v>

1785
01:28:15.090 --> 01:28:18.420
<v Speaker 6>How can you resort to those kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 6>racial slights?</v>

1786
01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:19.620
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't.</v>

1787
01:28:19.830 --> 01:28:24.830
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand how you can say don't</v>
<v Speaker 6>be racist and then you make racial </v>

1788
01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:26.790
<v Speaker 6>comments terribly racist comments.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>

1789
01:28:26.791 --> 01:28:28.350
<v Speaker 6>I don't under do people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1790
01:28:28.351 --> 01:28:33.351
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's the idea there is </v>

1791
01:28:33.351 --> 01:28:34.491
<v Speaker 6>straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You cannot on her racist comments </v>

1792
01:28:34.491 --> 01:28:36.360
<v Speaker 6>against the dominant group.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the rule.</v>

1793
01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:39.670
<v Speaker 6>If there's a dominant group,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so once you identify them as oppressor,</v>

1794
01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:44.720
<v Speaker 6>you can say anything you want about them</v>
<v Speaker 6>because by definition this is axiomatic </v>

1795
01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:48.680
<v Speaker 6>in the ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't say anything racist about the </v>

1796
01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:48.990
<v Speaker 6>oppressors,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that that's like a rule.</v>

1797
01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:53.460
<v Speaker 6>It's a rule of discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So here's where I go with this.</v>

1798
01:28:53.490 --> 01:28:57.450
<v Speaker 6>For self interest,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you not realize when you say,</v>

1799
01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:00.750
<v Speaker 6>I don't care about your efin white </v>
<v Speaker 6>fragility?</v>

1800
01:29:00.751 --> 01:29:02.100
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that not well cut.</v>

1801
01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:06.300
<v Speaker 2>Is that as I get his name right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Walcott,</v>

1802
01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:08.190
<v Speaker 2>Walcott,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't say,</v>

1803
01:29:08.230 --> 01:29:13.230
<v Speaker 2>but others other pundits have said that </v>
<v Speaker 2>in it's appeared on Lindsay Lindsay's </v>

1804
01:29:13.230 --> 01:29:16.970
<v Speaker 2>twitter page where they've assaulted her</v>
<v Speaker 2>there or that's too dramatic where </v>

1805
01:29:16.970 --> 01:29:19.470
<v Speaker 2>they've made insulted her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're insulted her there.</v>

1806
01:29:19.670 --> 01:29:21.470
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my,</v>

1807
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:23.520
<v Speaker 2>my point would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in your self interest,</v>

1808
01:29:23.550 --> 01:29:28.550
<v Speaker 2>do you not realize that you are giving </v>
<v Speaker 2>ammunition to the real white </v>

1809
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:30.960
<v Speaker 2>supremacists?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you not realize that there are really</v>

1810
01:29:31.170 --> 01:29:36.170
<v Speaker 2>dangerous people on the right who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for that exact kind of comment </v>

1811
01:29:36.170 --> 01:29:37.730
<v Speaker 2>to rationalize their behavior?</v>

1812
01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:39.400
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're trying to burn something down,</v>

1813
01:29:39.401 --> 01:29:42.910
<v Speaker 4>what makes you think you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>so careful about how it burns down?</v>

1814
01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:44.550
<v Speaker 4>And I really mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

1815
01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:45.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

1816
01:29:45.481 --> 01:29:50.481
<v Speaker 4>I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have interactions with the right wing </v>

1817
01:29:50.481 --> 01:29:53.820
<v Speaker 4>racial supremacists online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not very happy with me and it's </v>

1818
01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:57.211
<v Speaker 4>because I called them out for the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of behavior that the leftists </v>

1819
01:29:57.211 --> 01:29:57.211
<v Speaker 4>manifest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like,</v>

1820
01:29:57.390 --> 01:30:02.390
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not impressed by your manifestation </v>

1821
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:02.530
<v Speaker 4>of group identity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uber All let's say.</v>

1822
01:30:03.070 --> 01:30:08.070
<v Speaker 4>But I understand that the radical right </v>
<v Speaker 4>wingers are playing the same game as the</v>

1823
01:30:08.171 --> 01:30:09.640
<v Speaker 4>radical left winger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you might say,</v>

1824
01:30:09.641 --> 01:30:11.980
<v Speaker 4>well why would the radical left wingers </v>
<v Speaker 4>play into their hands?</v>

1825
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.970
<v Speaker 4>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1826
01:30:12.971 --> 01:30:17.971
<v Speaker 4>if you're trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're trying to burn the whole damn </v>

1827
01:30:17.971 --> 01:30:20.101
<v Speaker 4>house down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then why not inflame the people who are </v>

1828
01:30:20.101 --> 01:30:20.101
<v Speaker 4>most likely to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you might think,</v>

1829
01:30:20.101 --> 01:30:20.510
<v Speaker 4>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1830
01:30:20.650 --> 01:30:25.650
<v Speaker 4>that's not in anybody's best interest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's the stated aim of this </v>

1831
01:30:25.650 --> 01:30:25.650
<v Speaker 4>ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1832
01:30:25.650 --> 01:30:30.361
<v Speaker 4>They want to invert the pie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to invert the Patriarchy </v>

1833
01:30:30.361 --> 01:30:30.361
<v Speaker 4>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1834
01:30:30.361 --> 01:30:34.240
<v Speaker 4>what's the patriarchy while it's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>White Supremacist University of Toronto.</v>

1835
01:30:35.110 --> 01:30:39.100
<v Speaker 4>So who cares if you're handing your </v>
<v Speaker 4>opponents weapons,</v>

1836
01:30:39.220 --> 01:30:44.220
<v Speaker 2>you're hoping that it will escalate that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people on the left as well as the </v>

1837
01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:45.130
<v Speaker 2>people on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1838
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:51.790
<v Speaker 4>So its power because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the same thing has happened at </v>

1839
01:30:51.790 --> 01:30:55.130
<v Speaker 4>evergreen state and the whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>justification there was racism.</v>

1840
01:30:55.970 --> 01:30:57.770
<v Speaker 4>I know when they went in after Bret </v>
<v Speaker 4>Weinstein,</v>

1841
01:30:57.800 --> 01:31:00.320
<v Speaker 4>who is about is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean Brent is,</v>

1842
01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:02.840
<v Speaker 4>he's a Bernie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a Bernie supporter,</v>

1843
01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:03.920
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

1844
01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:06.950
<v Speaker 4>They eat their own.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Last week from Mike Paris,</v>

1845
01:31:06.951 --> 01:31:11.951
<v Speaker 4>who is the only colleague of his that </v>
<v Speaker 4>publicly defended him and he emails me </v>

1846
01:31:12.291 --> 01:31:17.291
<v Speaker 4>and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been following the story closely </v>

1847
01:31:17.291 --> 01:31:17.291
<v Speaker 4>and I just want to reach out and just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1848
01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:22.660
<v Speaker 4>commiserate with you and wonder is there</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything we can do or talk about it </v>

1849
01:31:22.660 --> 01:31:22.660
<v Speaker 4>together?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I thought,</v>

1850
01:31:22.670 --> 01:31:24.440
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're from evergreen state,</v>

1851
01:31:24.441 --> 01:31:29.441
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a nightmare and we're not that </v>

1852
01:31:29.441 --> 01:31:32.030
<v Speaker 4>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's the same pattern repeated.</v>

1853
01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:36.940
<v Speaker 4>It's not about transgender people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>their rights and,</v>

1854
01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:42.000
<v Speaker 4>and just the victim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't know the term transgender </v>

1855
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:42.380
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As far as I'm concerned,</v>

1856
01:31:42.381 --> 01:31:47.381
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're like sacrificial animals on the </v>

1857
01:31:47.381 --> 01:31:47.381
<v Speaker 4>altar of bill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See 16,</v>

1858
01:31:47.381 --> 01:31:49.490
<v Speaker 4>the activists have a new group that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>oppressed to wave the flag for,</v>

1859
01:31:49.491 --> 01:31:51.420
<v Speaker 4>to push forward their radiology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1860
01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:56.480
<v Speaker 4>and as NSA said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the consistent message I've got from </v>

1861
01:31:56.480 --> 01:31:58.610
<v Speaker 4>transsexual people is I wish they just </v>
<v Speaker 4>shut the hell up and quit putting us out</v>

1862
01:31:58.611 --> 01:31:59.450
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

1863
01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:00.250
<v Speaker 4>in the public</v>

1864
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:05.250
<v Speaker 6>eye in that guys,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because all they're doing is making our </v>

1865
01:32:05.250 --> 01:32:05.250
<v Speaker 6>life more difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

1866
01:32:05.250 --> 01:32:05.250
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't matter.</v>

1867
01:32:05.250 --> 01:32:06.370
<v Speaker 6>We're trying to tear down the </v>
<v Speaker 6>patriarchy.</v>

1868
01:32:06.371 --> 01:32:08.440
<v Speaker 6>Who cares if your life is being made </v>
<v Speaker 6>more difficult?</v>

1869
01:32:08.930 --> 01:32:13.930
<v Speaker 6>It's like you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't make an omelet without </v>

1870
01:32:13.930 --> 01:32:13.930
<v Speaker 6>breaking a few eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We want to keep that in mind.</v>

1871
01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:18.960
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Laurie prepares our students and </v>

1872
01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:19.930
<v Speaker 6>instructors for difficult discussions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1873
01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:25.680
<v Speaker 6>probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We support our teachers in navigating </v>

1874
01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:26.170
<v Speaker 6>complex and divisive issues with care </v>
<v Speaker 6>and confidence.</v>

1875
01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:29.200
<v Speaker 6>That's a more credible statement.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1876
01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:34.380
<v Speaker 6>especially given the outcome of this is </v>
<v Speaker 6>just want to take you back to the </v>

1877
01:32:34.380 --> 01:32:37.381
<v Speaker 6>lessons of the previous paragraph.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Lauria has commitment to academic </v>

1878
01:32:37.381 --> 01:32:38.990
<v Speaker 6>freedom or freedom of expression.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1879
01:32:39.010 --> 01:32:41.930
<v Speaker 6>that's unequivocal perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

1880
01:32:41.950 --> 01:32:45.150
<v Speaker 6>Except that they won't adopt the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Chicago principles.</v>

1881
01:32:45.151 --> 01:32:48.360
<v Speaker 6>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>something else to keep in mind that the.</v>

1882
01:32:48.810 --> 01:32:53.810
<v Speaker 6>I think this is the first time anybody's</v>
<v Speaker 6>talked about this when we were </v>

1883
01:32:53.810 --> 01:32:55.000
<v Speaker 6>established in 1973.</v>

1884
01:32:55.510 --> 01:33:00.510
<v Speaker 6>The Wilfred Laurier Act says </v>
<v Speaker 6>specifically that this university will </v>

1885
01:33:03.101 --> 01:33:08.101
<v Speaker 6>be dedicated to research and teaching in</v>
<v Speaker 6>the spirit of free inquiry and free </v>

1886
01:33:08.861 --> 01:33:13.861
<v Speaker 6>expression.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is the establishing act of our </v>

1887
01:33:13.861 --> 01:33:14.740
<v Speaker 6>universe charter statement and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

1888
01:33:14.741 --> 01:33:18.400
<v Speaker 6>and that is what it says is our mission.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So in fact,</v>

1889
01:33:18.460 --> 01:33:23.460
<v Speaker 6>we are breaking the law by not standing </v>
<v Speaker 6>behind maximum free expression.</v>

1890
01:33:26.501 --> 01:33:31.240
<v Speaker 6>And Max free inquire because it is right</v>
<v Speaker 6>in our very founding principle,</v>

1891
01:33:31.241 --> 01:33:36.241
<v Speaker 6>our very founding charter in the fact </v>
<v Speaker 6>that we are so hesitant to to just </v>

1892
01:33:37.121 --> 01:33:41.770
<v Speaker 6>embrace that and say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we know that it's within this contest of</v>

1893
01:33:41.771 --> 01:33:45.250
<v Speaker 6>ideas that the best facts come forward </v>
<v Speaker 6>and knowledges advanced.</v>

1894
01:33:46.150 --> 01:33:48.910
<v Speaker 6>Why are we afraid of that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why are we afraid?</v>

1895
01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:53.920
<v Speaker 6>What's made made every university a </v>
<v Speaker 6>great university because we're doubtful </v>

1896
01:33:54.371 --> 01:33:56.740
<v Speaker 6>about the integrity of the institution </v>
<v Speaker 6>like this.</v>

1897
01:33:56.820 --> 01:34:01.820
<v Speaker 6>This critique that whose claim is that </v>
<v Speaker 6>our institutions are patriarchal.</v>

1898
01:34:02.381 --> 01:34:06.160
<v Speaker 6>Institutions are fundamentally corrupt </v>
<v Speaker 6>and oppressive is sufficiently.</v>

1899
01:34:06.940 --> 01:34:10.600
<v Speaker 6>What would you say makes people </v>
<v Speaker 6>sufficiently guilty so they're perfectly</v>

1900
01:34:10.601 --> 01:34:15.100
<v Speaker 6>willing to circumvent their adherence to</v>
<v Speaker 6>policies,</v>

1901
01:34:15.460 --> 01:34:19.270
<v Speaker 6>to charter policies like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just think that at some point you have</v>

1902
01:34:19.271 --> 01:34:21.460
<v Speaker 6>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is why you were created.</v>

1903
01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:24.250
<v Speaker 6>Maybe we should get back to this and </v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe.</v>

1904
01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:28.390
<v Speaker 6>I mean maybe there's a someone who is in</v>
<v Speaker 6>the provincial parliament who's going to</v>

1905
01:34:28.391 --> 01:34:33.391
<v Speaker 6>say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm kind of upset that you've actually </v>

1906
01:34:33.391 --> 01:34:34.720
<v Speaker 6>rejected the very founding charter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would hear,</v>

1907
01:34:34.721 --> 01:34:39.721
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's no one in the current in the </v>

1908
01:34:39.721 --> 01:34:40.270
<v Speaker 6>current legislature that would do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Certainly not in the current government.</v>

1909
01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:41.440
<v Speaker 6>Not by any,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not it,</v>

1910
01:34:41.470 --> 01:34:42.730
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no chance at all.</v>

1911
01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:44.390
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1912
01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:49.440
<v Speaker 6>we support our teachers in navigating </v>
<v Speaker 6>complex and divisive issues with care </v>

1913
01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:51.670
<v Speaker 6>and confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We are leaders in ensuring our students,</v>

1914
01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:56.700
<v Speaker 6>faculty,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and staff have the necessary supports </v>

1915
01:34:56.700 --> 01:34:59.401
<v Speaker 6>and tools to help those who've </v>
<v Speaker 6>experienced marginalization and </v>

1916
01:34:59.401 --> 01:34:59.401
<v Speaker 6>discrimination to engage fully.</v>

1917
01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:01.190
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So now you see the reversal,</v>

1918
01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:02.120
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right away.</v>

1919
01:35:02.330 --> 01:35:07.330
<v Speaker 6>Here is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and this happens every time now that a </v>

1920
01:35:07.330 --> 01:35:09.761
<v Speaker 6>modern university,</v>
<v Speaker 6>virtually every time that a modern </v>

1921
01:35:09.761 --> 01:35:09.980
<v Speaker 6>university comes out with a statement in</v>
<v Speaker 6>favor of free speech,</v>

1922
01:35:10.130 --> 01:35:14.630
<v Speaker 6>the next thing they do is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is bringing this competing set of claims</v>

1923
01:35:14.631 --> 01:35:15.410
<v Speaker 6>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1924
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:21.070
<v Speaker 6>to help those who have experienced </v>
<v Speaker 6>marginalization and discrimination to </v>

1925
01:35:21.070 --> 01:35:25.331
<v Speaker 6>engage fully.</v>
<v Speaker 6>As soon as the word marginalization is </v>

1926
01:35:25.331 --> 01:35:25.740
<v Speaker 6>in there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then you know that that postmodern ethos</v>

1927
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:26.480
<v Speaker 6>has,</v>
<v Speaker 6>has,</v>

1928
01:35:26.570 --> 01:35:27.470
<v Speaker 6>has,</v>
<v Speaker 6>has,</v>

1929
01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:31.520
<v Speaker 6>has,</v>
<v Speaker 6>has manifested itself within the,</v>

1930
01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:34.040
<v Speaker 6>within the confines of the document </v>
<v Speaker 6>property.</v>

1931
01:35:34.041 --> 01:35:39.041
<v Speaker 6>Grounded academic debate at laureate </v>
<v Speaker 6>occurs everyday and encourages critical </v>

1932
01:35:39.041 --> 01:35:39.950
<v Speaker 6>thinking and civil discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1933
01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:44.180
<v Speaker 6>ideas that one finds objectionable </v>
<v Speaker 6>should be challenged and debated.</v>

1934
01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:49.420
<v Speaker 6>The common good of society depends on </v>
<v Speaker 6>the search for knowledge and it's free </v>

1935
01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:49.420
<v Speaker 6>expression.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

1936
01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:54.070
<v Speaker 6>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Free expression and academic university </v>

1937
01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:58.480
<v Speaker 6>academic freedom at the university </v>
<v Speaker 6>require accompanying responsibilities </v>

1938
01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:00.200
<v Speaker 6>and accountabilities to be met by </v>
<v Speaker 6>members of the university community.</v>

1939
01:36:00.290 --> 01:36:02.610
<v Speaker 6>The other shoe drops.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1940
01:36:02.620 --> 01:36:04.370
<v Speaker 6>even that statement,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not so bad.</v>

1941
01:36:04.371 --> 01:36:05.140
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

1942
01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:08.720
<v Speaker 6>Faculty members have responsibilities </v>
<v Speaker 6>and they should be accountable.</v>

1943
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:13.870
<v Speaker 6>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that university should be a </v>

1944
01:36:13.870 --> 01:36:13.870
<v Speaker 6>civil place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that it should be civil,</v>

1945
01:36:14.030 --> 01:36:17.450
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that there should be tolerance,</v>

1946
01:36:17.690 --> 01:36:22.690
<v Speaker 6>but tolerance is very different from an </v>
<v Speaker 6>embrace and a complete embrace of what </v>

1947
01:36:22.690 --> 01:36:25.500
<v Speaker 6>diversity is now defined as.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Or equity is defined.</v>

1948
01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:29.210
<v Speaker 6>Tolerance means I disagree,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I'm going to let you speak anyway.</v>

1949
01:36:29.570 --> 01:36:31.580
<v Speaker 6>And that really is the goal of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>university.</v>

1950
01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:32.930
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so anyway.</v>

1951
01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:33.610
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1952
01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:34.180
<v Speaker 6>We,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>

1953
01:36:34.220 --> 01:36:37.220
<v Speaker 6>we will continue to ensure that we are </v>
<v Speaker 6>protected against protecting,</v>

1954
01:36:37.221 --> 01:36:39.380
<v Speaker 6>against and dealing with hate and </v>
<v Speaker 6>intolerance.</v>

1955
01:36:39.410 --> 01:36:41.780
<v Speaker 6>These have those have no place in civil </v>
<v Speaker 6>society.</v>

1956
01:36:42.230 --> 01:36:47.230
<v Speaker 6>See that I'm not so sure about that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hate and intolerance have no place in </v>

1957
01:36:48.231 --> 01:36:50.180
<v Speaker 6>civil society.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The problem with that is hate,</v>

1958
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:52.370
<v Speaker 6>hate and intolerance is not defined </v>
<v Speaker 6>here.</v>

1959
01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:57.540
<v Speaker 6>That is the problem and the I keep </v>
<v Speaker 6>hearing hate speech is not free speech.</v>

1960
01:36:58.250 --> 01:36:59.450
<v Speaker 6>And then when I asked,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1961
01:36:59.451 --> 01:37:01.010
<v Speaker 6>what do you mean by hate speech?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

1962
01:37:01.011 --> 01:37:02.690
<v Speaker 6>that is the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1963
01:37:02.691 --> 01:37:05.390
<v Speaker 6>the other thing too is I'm actually </v>
<v Speaker 6>allowed to hate you.</v>

1964
01:37:06.530 --> 01:37:11.530
<v Speaker 6>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You might've done something that makes </v>

1965
01:37:11.530 --> 01:37:12.530
<v Speaker 6>me hate you but that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But there are limits on what I can do as</v>

1966
01:37:12.531 --> 01:37:14.600
<v Speaker 6>a consequence of that hate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that is not.</v>

1967
01:37:14.601 --> 01:37:19.601
<v Speaker 6>So there's two problems.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The first problem is this is a big one </v>

1968
01:37:19.601 --> 01:37:20.630
<v Speaker 6>who defines hate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a major problem.</v>

1969
01:37:20.930 --> 01:37:22.820
<v Speaker 6>And the second is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1970
01:37:22.850 --> 01:37:27.850
<v Speaker 6>you don't limit hate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't limit hate anymore than you </v>

1971
01:37:27.850 --> 01:37:30.581
<v Speaker 6>can limit anger or aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you can limit the manner in which </v>

1972
01:37:30.581 --> 01:37:32.130
<v Speaker 6>people conduct themselves when they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>motivated by those emotions.</v>

1973
01:37:32.150 --> 01:37:37.150
<v Speaker 6>And let's be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there is really a clear definition of </v>

1974
01:37:37.150 --> 01:37:38.840
<v Speaker 6>hate when you look at the criminal code </v>
<v Speaker 6>under sections three,</v>

1975
01:37:38.841 --> 01:37:39.920
<v Speaker 6>18,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and 3:19,</v>

1976
01:37:40.130 --> 01:37:45.130
<v Speaker 6>it says you cannot advocate physical </v>
<v Speaker 6>violence against an identifiable group.</v>

1977
01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:48.470
<v Speaker 6>I am totally on board with that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like let's,</v>

1978
01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:53.270
<v Speaker 6>let's be clear.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't say go and hurt these people.</v>

1979
01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:56.130
<v Speaker 6>I got that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But that's really clear.</v>

1980
01:37:57.240 --> 01:37:58.170
<v Speaker 6>Where's that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Definitely.</v>

1981
01:37:58.610 --> 01:38:03.610
<v Speaker 6>I just want to see all the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There is something we discussed earlier </v>

1982
01:38:03.610 --> 01:38:05.400
<v Speaker 6>is while then we can gerrymander the </v>
<v Speaker 6>definition of hurt,</v>

1983
01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:06.930
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1984
01:38:06.931 --> 01:38:09.750
<v Speaker 6>I'm talking physical advocating,</v>
<v Speaker 6>physical violence,</v>

1985
01:38:09.850 --> 01:38:11.210
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Physical after that,</v>

1986
01:38:11.250 --> 01:38:13.200
<v Speaker 6>physical in there because the criminal </v>
<v Speaker 6>code also does.</v>

1987
01:38:13.210 --> 01:38:17.370
<v Speaker 6>I think it does it in such a way to say </v>
<v Speaker 6>we can harm what is harm.</v>

1988
01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:22.400
<v Speaker 6>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>harm is longterm infliction of damage </v>

1989
01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:26.310
<v Speaker 6>that compromises your ability to </v>
<v Speaker 6>function or your appearance.</v>

1990
01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:29.790
<v Speaker 6>It's a pragmatic definition is grounded </v>
<v Speaker 6>in common law.</v>

1991
01:38:29.791 --> 01:38:34.791
<v Speaker 6>So we actually have a history of </v>
<v Speaker 6>defining it so that safe and let's not </v>

1992
01:38:34.791 --> 01:38:38.391
<v Speaker 6>move away from these definitions because</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're the thing that allow us to have </v>

1993
01:38:38.391 --> 01:38:40.290
<v Speaker 6>conversations that are uncomfortable but</v>
<v Speaker 6>needed.</v>

1994
01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:43.620
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>good.</v>

1995
01:38:44.010 --> 01:38:45.160
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1996
01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:48.930
<v Speaker 6>these have no place in civil society,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let alone on a university campus.</v>

1997
01:38:49.020 --> 01:38:51.780
<v Speaker 6>They will not be tolerated at Lori.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

1998
01:38:51.781 --> 01:38:52.450
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we see you.</v>

1999
01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:57.620
<v Speaker 6>We saw an example of that not being </v>
<v Speaker 6>tolerated with the Lindsay Shepherd </v>

2000
01:38:57.620 --> 01:39:00.060
<v Speaker 6>case.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I remain concerned by the way faculty,</v>

2001
01:39:00.061 --> 01:39:02.230
<v Speaker 6>staff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and students involved in aspects of this</v>

2002
01:39:02.231 --> 01:39:04.410
<v Speaker 6>situation were targeted with such </v>
<v Speaker 6>vitriol.</v>

2003
01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:07.320
<v Speaker 6>Now now things are starting to get out </v>
<v Speaker 6>of hand.</v>

2004
01:39:07.590 --> 01:39:10.080
<v Speaker 6>I remain concerned by the way faculty,</v>
<v Speaker 6>staff,</v>

2005
01:39:10.081 --> 01:39:13.840
<v Speaker 6>and students involved in aspects of this</v>
<v Speaker 6>situation were targeted with what,</v>

2006
01:39:13.890 --> 01:39:15.600
<v Speaker 6>with such vitriol,</v>
<v Speaker 6>vitriol.</v>

2007
01:39:15.601 --> 01:39:17.550
<v Speaker 6>That's acid day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

2008
01:39:17.551 --> 01:39:18.210
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is she,</v>

2009
01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:21.000
<v Speaker 6>you think she's talking about the tweets</v>
<v Speaker 6>that Lindsay has received them,</v>

2010
01:39:21.090 --> 01:39:23.940
<v Speaker 6>is that faculty,</v>
<v Speaker 6>staff and students.</v>

2011
01:39:23.970 --> 01:39:27.210
<v Speaker 6>So not just Lindsey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I just wonder is this,</v>

2012
01:39:27.630 --> 01:39:32.040
<v Speaker 6>does this apply to those who have been </v>
<v Speaker 6>advocating free speech?</v>

2013
01:39:32.190 --> 01:39:32.970
<v Speaker 6>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

2014
01:39:33.020 --> 01:39:34.320
<v Speaker 6>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm pointing it out there.</v>

2015
01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:39.440
<v Speaker 6>I mean all of us who have come out in </v>
<v Speaker 6>favor of maximum free speech have been </v>

2016
01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:44.240
<v Speaker 6>subjected to a lot of vitriol,</v>
<v Speaker 6>both emails and it's always anonymous </v>

2017
01:39:44.581 --> 01:39:47.520
<v Speaker 6>emails.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's always from people who will not say</v>

2018
01:39:47.521 --> 01:39:49.140
<v Speaker 6>who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

2019
01:39:49.220 --> 01:39:54.220
<v Speaker 6>but my point would be I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>unless there was something that simply </v>

2020
01:39:54.220 --> 01:39:55.860
<v Speaker 6>said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I am threatening your life.</v>

2021
01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:57.620
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I deleted.</v>

2022
01:39:58.050 --> 01:40:00.390
<v Speaker 6>That's what I do because this is what </v>
<v Speaker 6>happens.</v>

2023
01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:05.600
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wish people were civil but they're </v>

2024
01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:07.701
<v Speaker 6>not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no discussing heart issues </v>

2025
01:40:07.701 --> 01:40:07.701
<v Speaker 6>without conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like that's just not happening.</v>

2026
01:40:07.701 --> 01:40:12.530
<v Speaker 6>The question is how you live with the </v>
<v Speaker 6>conflict and you can't limit it to none </v>

2027
01:40:12.530 --> 01:40:13.290
<v Speaker 6>because then people can't have a </v>
<v Speaker 6>conflict.</v>

2028
01:40:13.291 --> 01:40:15.370
<v Speaker 6>They can solve a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so what you do is you.</v>

2029
01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:19.470
<v Speaker 6>You Limited well as we've limited quite </v>
<v Speaker 6>successfully in our country to date,</v>

2030
01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:24.500
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>We use the definitions of violence that </v>

2031
01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:26.781
<v Speaker 6>have prevailed throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 6>establishment of English common law and </v>

2032
01:40:26.781 --> 01:40:29.660
<v Speaker 6>that works just fine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My concern about that paragraph is that </v>

2033
01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:32.070
<v Speaker 6>she's cowtowing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's say,</v>

2034
01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:36.150
<v Speaker 6>to concerns about the way that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>people who actually,</v>

2035
01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:41.300
<v Speaker 6>let's say perpetrated this event were </v>
<v Speaker 6>dealt with by members of the general </v>

2036
01:40:41.881 --> 01:40:46.881
<v Speaker 6>public,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so member members of the university </v>

2037
01:40:46.881 --> 01:40:51.321
<v Speaker 6>community must be supported to work and </v>
<v Speaker 6>study in an environment free of </v>

2038
01:40:51.321 --> 01:40:54.090
<v Speaker 6>discrimination and harassment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a tougher and they have</v>

2039
01:40:54.090 --> 01:40:59.090
<v Speaker 4>my commitment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We will continue to make this a </v>

2040
01:40:59.090 --> 01:40:59.090
<v Speaker 4>university priority.</v>

2041
01:40:59.090 --> 01:41:03.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a sentence that worries me in an </v>

2042
01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:04.530
<v Speaker 4>environment free of discrimination and </v>
<v Speaker 4>harassment and they have my.</v>

2043
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:09.060
<v Speaker 4>The problem is it's so difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 4>distinguish that between real dispute.</v>

2044
01:41:09.710 --> 01:41:11.310
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you're.</v>

2045
01:41:11.370 --> 01:41:13.470
<v Speaker 4>If you're committed to a line of </v>
<v Speaker 4>argumentation,</v>

2046
01:41:13.471 --> 01:41:15.570
<v Speaker 4>you stake your whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your whole life on it,</v>

2047
01:41:15.571 --> 01:41:20.571
<v Speaker 4>say your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your whole academic career and you're </v>

2048
01:41:20.571 --> 01:41:21.480
<v Speaker 4>engaged in a dispute with someone else </v>
<v Speaker 4>who holds a contrary view point.</v>

2049
01:41:21.690 --> 01:41:25.200
<v Speaker 4>There's going to be heat and sparks </v>
<v Speaker 4>generated by that exchange.</v>

2050
01:41:25.230 --> 01:41:30.230
<v Speaker 4>There has to be because otherwise you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>not talking about anything of any </v>

2051
01:41:30.230 --> 01:41:30.230
<v Speaker 4>importance.</v>

2052
01:41:30.230 --> 01:41:30.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we all agree,</v>

2053
01:41:30.230 --> 01:41:31.850
<v Speaker 2>we don't need free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2054
01:41:31.851 --> 01:41:33.680
<v Speaker 2>that's standard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing,</v>

2055
01:41:33.710 --> 01:41:35.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I read this line,</v>

2056
01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:39.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>members of the university community must</v>

2057
01:41:39.261 --> 01:41:44.261
<v Speaker 2>be supported to work and study in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment free of discrimination and </v>

2058
01:41:44.261 --> 01:41:48.311
<v Speaker 2>harassment and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just wonder how equally that idea </v>

2059
01:41:50.181 --> 01:41:55.181
<v Speaker 2>has been applied at my university so far</v>
<v Speaker 2>because certainly we know that our </v>

2060
01:41:55.760 --> 01:42:00.740
<v Speaker 2>president has sent out letters of </v>
<v Speaker 2>support to the Lgbtq community,</v>

2061
01:42:01.010 --> 01:42:04.190
<v Speaker 2>which she was right to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they are feeling harassed,</v>

2062
01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:07.640
<v Speaker 2>I have no problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time,</v>

2063
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:10.130
<v Speaker 2>there are official bodies at our </v>
<v Speaker 2>university,</v>

2064
01:42:10.131 --> 01:42:15.131
<v Speaker 2>the women's center and other bodies that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are under the auspices of the diversity </v>

2065
01:42:15.131 --> 01:42:16.180
<v Speaker 2>and Equity Office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2066
01:42:16.270 --> 01:42:19.580
<v Speaker 2>if I'm correct that are petitioning to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a,</v>

2067
01:42:19.581 --> 01:42:24.581
<v Speaker 2>there's a pro life group on campus and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are petitioning to have them </v>

2068
01:42:24.581 --> 01:42:25.580
<v Speaker 2>defunded and shut down.</v>

2069
01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:26.420
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2070
01:42:26.421 --> 01:42:31.421
<v Speaker 4>so did Debra mccloud,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she sent out a letter to all the people </v>

2071
01:42:31.421 --> 01:42:31.421
<v Speaker 4>who are supporting the shepherd to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2072
01:42:31.421 --> 01:42:32.660
<v Speaker 4>we're really sorry about older</v>

2073
01:42:33.730 --> 01:42:35.150
<v Speaker 2>your responses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My point,</v>

2074
01:42:36.230 --> 01:42:41.230
<v Speaker 2>our president is aware that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>group on campus that are marginalized.</v>

2075
01:42:42.290 --> 01:42:45.590
<v Speaker 2>These are the prolife students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't care what your position is,</v>

2076
01:42:45.591 --> 01:42:49.280
<v Speaker 2>pro life or pro choice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever your position is,</v>

2077
01:42:49.281 --> 01:42:51.890
<v Speaker 2>you bloody will have to admit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's at least a debate.</v>

2078
01:42:51.950 --> 01:42:53.260
<v Speaker 2>There is a debate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2079
01:42:53.261 --> 01:42:58.261
<v Speaker 2>and the point I would make is here truly</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a marginalized group of students who </v>

2080
01:42:58.671 --> 01:43:01.280
<v Speaker 2>have received no support from our </v>
<v Speaker 2>university.</v>

2081
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:04.190
<v Speaker 2>None.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know my president is aware because</v>

2082
01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:09.220
<v Speaker 2>early on in this controversy I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and another matter is that these </v>

2083
01:43:09.261 --> 01:43:11.660
<v Speaker 2>students are being attacked or I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

2084
01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:16.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to use hyperbolic language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These students are being harassed and </v>

2085
01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:20.951
<v Speaker 2>they are being harassed because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were being threatened with having their </v>

2086
01:43:20.951 --> 01:43:22.910
<v Speaker 2>funding removed by official bodies of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the university.</v>

2087
01:43:23.290 --> 01:43:28.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well there's the prolife students are </v>

2088
01:43:28.290 --> 01:43:28.290
<v Speaker 4>real canaries in the coal mine as far as</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm concerned,</v>

2089
01:43:28.290 --> 01:43:28.830
<v Speaker 4>regardless of what you think about,</v>

2090
01:43:29.110 --> 01:43:33.880
<v Speaker 2>do anything represent diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideological diversity.</v>

2091
01:43:34.450 --> 01:43:37.930
<v Speaker 2>But we're not seeing any reception of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these diverse students.</v>

2092
01:43:38.230 --> 01:43:43.230
<v Speaker 2>Do they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they being included in this </v>

2093
01:43:43.230 --> 01:43:43.340
<v Speaker 2>diversity and inclusion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2094
01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:47.890
<v Speaker 2>they're being excluded purposely by </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual offices of my university.</v>

2095
01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:49.340
<v Speaker 2>So I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2096
01:43:49.830 --> 01:43:52.070
<v Speaker 2>that's standard practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say on campuses</v>

2097
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:54.050
<v Speaker 6>across the country,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just uneven,</v>

2098
01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:59.480
<v Speaker 6>it's uneven,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I think that what what we need to </v>

2099
01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:03.191
<v Speaker 6>see a is just a policy that applies to </v>
<v Speaker 6>all students and not just those who </v>

2100
01:44:03.321 --> 01:44:08.321
<v Speaker 6>smell right or are orthodox to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>social justice or who were in the.</v>

2101
01:44:08.750 --> 01:44:11.420
<v Speaker 6>What would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Acceptable class of victims.</v>

2102
01:44:12.310 --> 01:44:17.310
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It bears repeating in the current </v>

2103
01:44:17.310 --> 01:44:17.310
<v Speaker 6>context that Laurie is support for our </v>
<v Speaker 6>lesbian,</v>

2104
01:44:17.310 --> 01:44:17.420
<v Speaker 6>gay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bi,</v>

2105
01:44:17.421 --> 01:44:18.170
<v Speaker 6>trans,</v>
<v Speaker 6>queer,</v>

2106
01:44:18.171 --> 01:44:23.171
<v Speaker 6>and two spirited campus community and </v>
<v Speaker 6>transgender people in particular is </v>

2107
01:44:23.171 --> 01:44:26.921
<v Speaker 6>unwavering.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It isn't the obvious that it bears </v>

2108
01:44:26.921 --> 01:44:29.141
<v Speaker 6>repeating in the current context because</v>
<v Speaker 6>the issue here fundamentally is that </v>

2109
01:44:29.141 --> 01:44:33.310
<v Speaker 6>Lindsay Shepherd was was subject to an </v>
<v Speaker 6>administrative inquisition despite the </v>

2110
01:44:34.041 --> 01:44:38.810
<v Speaker 6>fact that she was 100 percent innocent </v>
<v Speaker 6>by the university's own standards,</v>

2111
01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:43.960
<v Speaker 6>and so it doesn't bear repeating in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>current context that is support for our </v>

2112
01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:48.731
<v Speaker 6>lbgt to Lgbtq campus community and pr </v>
<v Speaker 6>and transgender people.</v>

2113
01:44:50.541 --> 01:44:53.360
<v Speaker 6>In particular is unwavering.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It actually isn't about them.</v>

2114
01:44:53.660 --> 01:44:58.660
<v Speaker 6>It's not about them at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's about the fact that she got </v>

2115
01:44:58.660 --> 01:45:00.320
<v Speaker 6>pilloried for doing something that she </v>
<v Speaker 6>was actually right to do.</v>

2116
01:45:00.620 --> 01:45:05.150
<v Speaker 6>So I'm not happy with the fact that this</v>
<v Speaker 6>paragraph was inserted into here.</v>

2117
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:10.270
<v Speaker 6>I think it's an indication of exactly </v>
<v Speaker 6>the kind of administrative weakness that</v>

2118
01:45:10.341 --> 01:45:12.470
<v Speaker 6>allowed this sort of event to occur to </v>
<v Speaker 6>begin with.</v>

2119
01:45:12.610 --> 01:45:12.780
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>

2120
01:45:13.150 --> 01:45:14.910
<v Speaker 7>this is the theme though,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right,</v>

2121
01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:18.520
<v Speaker 7>of the Justice Warriors,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is that this is the victim group they've</v>

2122
01:45:18.521 --> 01:45:20.440
<v Speaker 7>repeated over and over that there's been</v>
<v Speaker 7>violence,</v>

2123
01:45:20.441 --> 01:45:22.060
<v Speaker 7>harassment,</v>
<v Speaker 7>vitriol.</v>

2124
01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:27.360
<v Speaker 7>Everybody's picking up on that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The union president said that it was </v>

2125
01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:28.170
<v Speaker 7>daily occurrence.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The president's repeated.</v>

2126
01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:31.720
<v Speaker 7>She's issued a campus wide email and </v>
<v Speaker 7>response to the open letter saying,</v>

2127
01:45:32.050 --> 01:45:34.120
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're going to make this a safe campus.</v>

2128
01:45:34.510 --> 01:45:36.810
<v Speaker 7>She's repeating it here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So the validation,</v>

2129
01:45:36.811 --> 01:45:36.890
<v Speaker 7>yes,</v>

2130
01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:41.950
<v Speaker 6>their narrative of victimization </v>
<v Speaker 6>emerging from the Lindsay Shepherd </v>

2131
01:45:41.950 --> 01:45:41.950
<v Speaker 6>event.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Without evidence,</v>

2132
01:45:41.950 --> 01:45:42.330
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>

2133
01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:45.660
<v Speaker 6>we actually send an email to our </v>
<v Speaker 6>faculty,</v>

2134
01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:48.360
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Union president and we said,</v>

2135
01:45:49.230 --> 01:45:54.030
<v Speaker 6>we're concerned about this daily </v>
<v Speaker 6>violence on campus.</v>

2136
01:45:54.270 --> 01:45:58.290
<v Speaker 6>Could you please supply us with evidence</v>
<v Speaker 6>of this?</v>

2137
01:45:58.291 --> 01:45:59.850
<v Speaker 6>And she wrote back and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2138
01:46:00.830 --> 01:46:02.310
<v Speaker 6>what did she say something</v>

2139
01:46:02.820 --> 01:46:04.980
<v Speaker 7>as I'm telling everyone in the press,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>

2140
01:46:05.530 --> 01:46:06.850
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because it would inflate,</v>

2141
01:46:06.851 --> 01:46:11.851
<v Speaker 6>didn't she say because it would inflame </v>
<v Speaker 6>the situation even further with </v>

2142
01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.600
<v Speaker 6>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So how,</v>

2143
01:46:13.750 --> 01:46:18.750
<v Speaker 6>how in the world providing evidence that</v>
<v Speaker 6>something like that with members of the </v>

2144
01:46:18.750 --> 01:46:22.471
<v Speaker 6>union,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we are paying our fees just like </v>

2145
01:46:22.471 --> 01:46:22.540
<v Speaker 6>everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And we just,</v>

2146
01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:27.600
<v Speaker 6>we wanted substantiate some </v>
<v Speaker 6>substantiation to these claims that </v>

2147
01:46:28.721 --> 01:46:30.170
<v Speaker 6>there was violence as a daily.</v>

2148
01:46:30.190 --> 01:46:32.380
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the whole premise is that there's injury</v>

2149
01:46:32.381 --> 01:46:34.930
<v Speaker 7>happening and that's why we can't speak </v>
<v Speaker 7>about these things.</v>

2150
01:46:35.110 --> 01:46:40.110
<v Speaker 7>So if they can establish the violence,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then maybe we're sympathetic to the </v>

2151
01:46:40.110 --> 01:46:40.900
<v Speaker 7>argument that the space shouldn't occur.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But.</v>

2152
01:46:40.901 --> 01:46:45.400
<v Speaker 7>But that's susceptible to bogus claims.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If there's no substantiation,</v>

2153
01:46:46.060 --> 01:46:47.920
<v Speaker 7>you can't build policy that way.</v>

2154
01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:49.980
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not without</v>

2155
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:54.980
<v Speaker 4>getting into the kind of trouble that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>already emerged in light of recent </v>

2156
01:46:54.980 --> 01:46:56.490
<v Speaker 4>events.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have added measures to improve campus</v>

2157
01:46:56.491 --> 01:46:58.500
<v Speaker 4>safety while it is by.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2158
01:46:58.530 --> 01:46:59.370
<v Speaker 4>See that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2159
01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:04.520
<v Speaker 4>that actually seems to me to be the one </v>
<v Speaker 4>sentence in this article so far.</v>

2160
01:47:04.921 --> 01:47:09.921
<v Speaker 4>That's actually a mistake because by </v>
<v Speaker 4>going forward with what practices are </v>

2161
01:47:12.641 --> 01:47:17.641
<v Speaker 4>that are going to improve campus safety,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then the president is validating the </v>

2162
01:47:18.001 --> 01:47:23.001
<v Speaker 4>claims of the people who claim that this</v>
<v Speaker 4>occurrence produced an unsafe </v>

2163
01:47:23.311 --> 01:47:25.110
<v Speaker 4>environment on the campus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2164
01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:26.650
<v Speaker 4>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2165
01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:31.980
<v Speaker 4>I think that that was weak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We will ensure that all students,</v>

2166
01:47:32.131 --> 01:47:37.131
<v Speaker 4>staff and faculty know exactly what our </v>
<v Speaker 4>commitment to academic freedom and </v>

2167
01:47:37.131 --> 01:47:37.440
<v Speaker 4>freedom of expression means in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>classroom.</v>

2168
01:47:37.740 --> 01:47:40.020
<v Speaker 4>That would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To that end,</v>

2169
01:47:40.021 --> 01:47:43.920
<v Speaker 4>we have established the task force on </v>
<v Speaker 4>freedom of expression to take input from</v>

2170
01:47:43.921 --> 01:47:46.230
<v Speaker 4>our community,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which we should point out,</v>

2171
01:47:46.710 --> 01:47:49.260
<v Speaker 4>which won't include Lindsay Shepherd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2172
01:47:49.261 --> 01:47:51.570
<v Speaker 4>Because she asked to be part of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>taskforce.</v>

2173
01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:53.610
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe that they offered it to her.</v>

2174
01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:54.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm not exactly sure.</v>

2175
01:47:55.270 --> 01:48:00.270
<v Speaker 2>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some Grad students nominated her and it </v>

2176
01:48:00.270 --> 01:48:03.181
<v Speaker 2>was prior to the revelation being made </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it would be the position would be </v>

2177
01:48:03.181 --> 01:48:06.400
<v Speaker 2>filled by the president of the graduate </v>
<v Speaker 2>students association who,</v>

2178
01:48:07.060 --> 01:48:09.370
<v Speaker 2>and I think this was poor form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2179
01:48:10.030 --> 01:48:15.030
<v Speaker 2>just before that announcement was made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the president of the Graduate Students </v>

2180
01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:20.760
<v Speaker 2>Association put out a statement where I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if it's a he or she or a,</v>

2181
01:48:21.161 --> 01:48:22.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

2182
01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:24.380
<v Speaker 2>gender pronoun use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

2183
01:48:25.250 --> 01:48:29.890
<v Speaker 2>that they were standing 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind the Trans and Lgbtq.</v>

2184
01:48:29.950 --> 01:48:30.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the.</v>

2185
01:48:30.970 --> 01:48:35.970
<v Speaker 4>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that they were going to sit on </v>

2186
01:48:35.970 --> 01:48:35.970
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the taskforce would indicate that all</v>

2187
01:48:35.970 --> 01:48:37.330
<v Speaker 4>students would be represented properly,</v>

2188
01:48:37.330 --> 01:48:42.010
<v Speaker 2>but it's just the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They showed this incredible bias.</v>

2189
01:48:42.340 --> 01:48:43.510
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they said,</v>

2190
01:48:43.511 --> 01:48:45.550
<v Speaker 2>and we're going to be sitting on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't,</v>

2191
01:48:45.551 --> 01:48:50.551
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that that does a service to</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the Grad students who they </v>

2192
01:48:50.551 --> 01:48:50.551
<v Speaker 2>represent.</v>

2193
01:48:50.740 --> 01:48:54.590
<v Speaker 4>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at best practices beyond Lori pay.</v>

2194
01:48:54.620 --> 01:48:59.620
<v Speaker 4>They could look at Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that'd be good and develop a clear </v>

2195
01:48:59.620 --> 01:48:59.800
<v Speaker 4>tangible and you never know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they will.</v>

2196
01:48:59.850 --> 01:49:01.810
<v Speaker 4>You never know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And develop a clear,</v>

2197
01:49:01.811 --> 01:49:04.900
<v Speaker 4>tangible set of practical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>implementable guidelines that will bring</v>

2198
01:49:04.901 --> 01:49:09.901
<v Speaker 4>clarity to this issue for our own </v>
<v Speaker 4>classrooms and we'll have the potential </v>

2199
01:49:09.901 --> 01:49:13.141
<v Speaker 4>to serve as best practices for others.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's exactly what you guys are </v>

2200
01:49:13.141 --> 01:49:13.960
<v Speaker 4>recommending.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is my commitment to you.</v>

2201
01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:19.200
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's not like the University of </v>

2202
01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:19.200
<v Speaker 4>Chicago is a lightweight</v>

2203
01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:21.180
<v Speaker 2>and it's not just the University of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chicago over 30 universities.</v>

2204
01:49:21.181 --> 01:49:25.050
<v Speaker 2>Many of them Ivy League have adopted the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chicago statements to great effect.</v>

2205
01:49:25.051 --> 01:49:25.560
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2206
01:49:25.650 --> 01:49:26.790
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is.</v>

2207
01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:30.660
<v Speaker 2>This is something that has worked that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is working.</v>

2208
01:49:31.170 --> 01:49:33.150
<v Speaker 2>It's clearly something that should </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen in Canada.</v>

2209
01:49:33.151 --> 01:49:35.580
<v Speaker 2>It would be a wonderful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be a wonderful thing to do.</v>

2210
01:49:35.610 --> 01:49:36.750
<v Speaker 2>Would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be so wonderful.</v>

2211
01:49:36.751 --> 01:49:41.250
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like we're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>institute this policy that hasn't worked</v>

2212
01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:46.460
<v Speaker 2>and that hasn't been been accepted by </v>
<v Speaker 2>really prominent universities in the US </v>

2213
01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:48.130
<v Speaker 2>and it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't</v>

2214
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:53.130
<v Speaker 6>involve us a law or legal ease.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It is simply a statement of philosophy </v>

2215
01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:58.830
<v Speaker 6>about what we want and which is maximum </v>
<v Speaker 6>free expression and free inquiry within </v>

2216
01:49:58.830 --> 01:49:58.830
<v Speaker 6>the bounds of the law.</v>

2217
01:49:59.290 --> 01:50:03.180
<v Speaker 7>And I just think this task force is </v>
<v Speaker 7>going to be a disaster because,</v>

2218
01:50:03.510 --> 01:50:04.680
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the justice,</v>

2219
01:50:04.940 --> 01:50:09.940
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>advocates aren't interested in free </v>

2220
01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:09.940
<v Speaker 7>speech,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2221
01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:13.170
<v Speaker 7>they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they want to forbid certain forms of </v>

2222
01:50:13.170 --> 01:50:14.110
<v Speaker 7>speech and it's just a question of which</v>
<v Speaker 7>topics and who's going to come</v>

2223
01:50:14.140 --> 01:50:16.300
<v Speaker 6>troll the lender might be enough public </v>
<v Speaker 6>screwed.</v>

2224
01:50:16.330 --> 01:50:18.700
<v Speaker 6>Like I don't think interest in Wilfrid </v>
<v Speaker 6>laurier.</v>

2225
01:50:18.810 --> 01:50:22.030
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure that the president would be </v>
<v Speaker 6>real happy if this went away,</v>

2226
01:50:22.450 --> 01:50:27.450
<v Speaker 6>but I think the probability that it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to go away is very low because I </v>

2227
01:50:27.450 --> 01:50:31.081
<v Speaker 6>think Wilford Laurey is now being </v>
<v Speaker 6>watched and being watched by very many </v>

2228
01:50:31.081 --> 01:50:32.620
<v Speaker 6>people to see what the genuine outcome </v>
<v Speaker 6>of this will be.</v>

2229
01:50:32.830 --> 01:50:35.920
<v Speaker 6>And I think that even if it was ignored </v>
<v Speaker 6>by the mainstream media,</v>

2230
01:50:35.921 --> 01:50:40.921
<v Speaker 6>which it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not going to be ignored by people </v>

2231
01:50:40.921 --> 01:50:43.470
<v Speaker 6>on Youtube and the people who've been </v>
<v Speaker 6>who've been generating content </v>

2232
01:50:43.470 --> 01:50:44.280
<v Speaker 6>associated with Lindsay shepherd and </v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2233
01:50:44.350 --> 01:50:47.740
<v Speaker 6>the magnitude of that content online is </v>
<v Speaker 6>absolutely overwhelming.</v>

2234
01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:49.960
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if the Wilfred laureate </v>
<v Speaker 6>administrators.</v>

2235
01:50:49.961 --> 01:50:52.240
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because you know people older than 40,</v>

2236
01:50:52.241 --> 01:50:54.580
<v Speaker 6>you usually don't know much about online</v>
<v Speaker 6>media,</v>

2237
01:50:54.790 --> 01:50:58.330
<v Speaker 6>but the amount of commentary this has </v>
<v Speaker 6>been generating,</v>

2238
01:50:58.420 --> 01:51:03.420
<v Speaker 6>this is generated on youtube is </v>
<v Speaker 6>absolutely beyond belief like it was a </v>

2239
01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:03.420
<v Speaker 6>major scandal.</v>

2240
01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:06.370
<v Speaker 6>Back to the task force though,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and we'll you've said this in the past,</v>

2241
01:51:06.910 --> 01:51:11.910
<v Speaker 6>the freedom of expression proponents,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we already are the compromise position </v>

2242
01:51:11.910 --> 01:51:16.120
<v Speaker 6>because we are saying we want you to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>able to articulate whatever position you</v>

2243
01:51:16.121 --> 01:51:21.121
<v Speaker 6>have.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We want you to be able to like we are </v>

2244
01:51:21.121 --> 01:51:24.301
<v Speaker 6>the compromise position.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're not saying we want to shut down </v>

2245
01:51:24.301 --> 01:51:24.790
<v Speaker 6>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whatever your position is,</v>

2246
01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:27.160
<v Speaker 6>let's hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's that.</v>

2247
01:51:27.190 --> 01:51:32.190
<v Speaker 6>That is where we are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So we're already in that compromise </v>

2248
01:51:32.190 --> 01:51:35.821
<v Speaker 6>position in the boundaries of the law,</v>
<v Speaker 6>within the boundaries of the law in </v>

2249
01:51:35.821 --> 01:51:37.360
<v Speaker 6>respect to the university in its </v>
<v Speaker 6>operations.</v>

2250
01:51:37.361 --> 01:51:38.350
<v Speaker 6>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

2251
01:51:38.380 --> 01:51:42.520
<v Speaker 6>so we're already saying we want all </v>
<v Speaker 6>these sides to be able to be hurt.</v>

2252
01:51:42.521 --> 01:51:47.521
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's already approved diversity of </v>

2253
01:51:47.521 --> 01:51:47.521
<v Speaker 6>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It is.</v>

2254
01:51:47.521 --> 01:51:50.290
<v Speaker 6>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so what I have to look at is many of</v>

2255
01:51:50.291 --> 01:51:55.291
<v Speaker 6>the colleagues that I have who are on </v>
<v Speaker 6>the left and are hoping for restriction </v>

2256
01:51:55.291 --> 01:51:58.330
<v Speaker 6>of free expression are really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to a certain extent,</v>

2257
01:51:58.660 --> 01:52:00.400
<v Speaker 6>linguistic imperialists.</v>

2258
01:52:00.790 --> 01:52:03.780
<v Speaker 6>That's exactly why I objected to bill </v>
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible].</v>

2259
01:52:04.180 --> 01:52:09.180
<v Speaker 6>I said that I wasn't going to let the </v>
<v Speaker 6>linguistic imperialists take control </v>

2260
01:52:09.180 --> 01:52:13.171
<v Speaker 6>over my voice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The fact that it happened to be about </v>

2261
01:52:13.171 --> 01:52:15.751
<v Speaker 6>transgender pronouns with.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well that was just how that problem </v>

2262
01:52:15.751 --> 01:52:16.690
<v Speaker 6>manifested itself at that period of </v>
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>

2263
01:52:16.930 --> 01:52:18.700
<v Speaker 6>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that what have you called them?</v>

2264
01:52:18.701 --> 01:52:21.160
<v Speaker 6>Linguistic imperialist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's exactly right.</v>

2265
01:52:21.161 --> 01:52:22.180
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and these,</v>

2266
01:52:22.210 --> 01:52:27.210
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these idiot ideologues on the radical </v>

2267
01:52:27.210 --> 01:52:29.761
<v Speaker 6>left who were so good at neologisms are </v>
<v Speaker 6>unbelievably good at grasping the </v>

2268
01:52:29.761 --> 01:52:31.390
<v Speaker 6>linguistic territory.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean the,</v>

2269
01:52:31.410 --> 01:52:35.170
<v Speaker 6>the propagation of words like cis </v>
<v Speaker 6>gendered is a perfect example of that.</v>

2270
01:52:35.630 --> 01:52:36.600
<v Speaker 6>So it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2271
01:52:36.601 --> 01:52:41.601
<v Speaker 6>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand how they can be so </v>

2272
01:52:41.601 --> 01:52:44.020
<v Speaker 6>against colonialism and imperialism and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then want to do that in,</v>

2273
01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:46.140
<v Speaker 6>in the sphere of language,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in</v>

2274
01:52:46.140 --> 01:52:49.910
<v Speaker 4>an authoritarian structure which can </v>
<v Speaker 4>only be abused.</v>

2275
01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:50.640
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

2276
01:52:50.730 --> 01:52:55.730
<v Speaker 4>that's part of the weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See there's this weird marriage between </v>

2277
01:52:55.730 --> 01:52:57.030
<v Speaker 4>postmodernism in Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2278
01:52:57.031 --> 01:53:02.031
<v Speaker 4>Which makes no sense because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually can't be a postmodernist and I </v>

2279
01:53:02.031 --> 01:53:03.510
<v Speaker 4>guess you can be a critical thinker and </v>
<v Speaker 4>a Marxist,</v>

2280
01:53:03.540 --> 01:53:08.540
<v Speaker 4>but you cannot be a postmodernist data </v>
<v Speaker 4>Marxist at the same time because the </v>

2281
01:53:08.540 --> 01:53:12.150
<v Speaker 4>postmodernists hypothetically are </v>
<v Speaker 4>critical of grand narratives,</v>

2282
01:53:12.180 --> 01:53:13.410
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't believe that they,</v>

2283
01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:15.780
<v Speaker 4>that they have in a universal validity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>

2284
01:53:15.781 --> 01:53:18.840
<v Speaker 4>the problem with that is that without a </v>
<v Speaker 4>grand narrative you can't act,</v>

2285
01:53:19.170 --> 01:53:23.130
<v Speaker 4>but they sneak the Marxism in through </v>
<v Speaker 4>the back door and then the justification</v>

2286
01:53:23.131 --> 01:53:26.670
<v Speaker 4>I think is for these authentic </v>
<v Speaker 4>authoritarian impositions is that,</v>

2287
01:53:26.920 --> 01:53:31.920
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter as long as the right </v>

2288
01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:32.280
<v Speaker 4>people are being hurt by them and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>right people would be the people who are</v>

2289
01:53:32.281 --> 01:53:37.281
<v Speaker 4>in positions of power now who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who have no justification for being in </v>

2290
01:53:37.281 --> 01:53:38.510
<v Speaker 4>those positions of power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2291
01:53:38.550 --> 01:53:43.550
<v Speaker 4>Because they don't stable solution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're making the assumption that </v>

2292
01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:45.090
<v Speaker 4>what's being sought after is a stable </v>
<v Speaker 4>solution,</v>

2293
01:53:45.660 --> 01:53:50.660
<v Speaker 4>and I think that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a dangerous assumption </v>

2294
01:53:50.660 --> 01:53:53.270
<v Speaker 4>because I think that the university </v>
<v Speaker 4>activists mean exactly what they say </v>

2295
01:53:54.270 --> 01:53:56.820
<v Speaker 4>when they say that we should be flipping</v>
<v Speaker 4>over the patriarch.</v>

2296
01:53:56.870 --> 01:54:00.500
<v Speaker 7>They've put no counterproposal forward </v>
<v Speaker 7>throughout this.</v>

2297
01:54:00.501 --> 01:54:02.870
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like they don't have a solution,</v>

2298
01:54:03.230 --> 01:54:06.440
<v Speaker 7>a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're not even talking about a list of</v>

2299
01:54:06.441 --> 01:54:11.441
<v Speaker 7>forbidden topics and who's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 7>adjudicated and what the appeals </v>

2300
01:54:11.441 --> 01:54:11.630
<v Speaker 7>process,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so that's always.</v>

2301
01:54:11.660 --> 01:54:12.800
<v Speaker 7>That's always done post hoc.</v>

2302
01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:18.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That way you can keep the level of fear </v>

2303
01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:18.120
<v Speaker 4>that you can keep adding to the list as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

2304
01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:19.440
<v Speaker 4>Definitely that will because it's way </v>
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>

2305
01:54:19.441 --> 01:54:24.441
<v Speaker 4>It's way better if you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's way better if you want to exercise </v>

2306
01:54:24.441 --> 01:54:27.501
<v Speaker 4>power over people to never let them be </v>
<v Speaker 4>sure which policies they're violating </v>

2307
01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:30.390
<v Speaker 4>and I think that what happened to </v>
<v Speaker 4>Lindsay Shepherd is an excellent example</v>

2308
01:54:30.391 --> 01:54:31.740
<v Speaker 4>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's a.</v>

2309
01:54:31.741 --> 01:54:36.741
<v Speaker 4>it's a canonical example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's the Orwellian idea of freedom is</v>

2310
01:54:36.841 --> 01:54:41.841
<v Speaker 4>the ability to say two plus two equals </v>
<v Speaker 4>four and they want to keep avoiding the </v>

2311
01:54:41.841 --> 01:54:45.651
<v Speaker 4>ability to say two plus two is four by </v>
<v Speaker 4>creating new answers and moving on and </v>

2312
01:54:45.740 --> 01:54:50.740
<v Speaker 4>he just went through this whole process </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a statement unfree expression and </v>

2313
01:54:51.121 --> 01:54:53.460
<v Speaker 4>it goes on for paragraphs and paragraphs</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the last,</v>

2314
01:54:53.700 --> 01:54:58.700
<v Speaker 4>nearly the last sentence is freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 4>expression does not trump all other </v>

2315
01:54:58.700 --> 01:55:02.580
<v Speaker 4>rights in the university community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Freedom of expression.</v>

2316
01:55:02.790 --> 01:55:05.700
<v Speaker 4>Can only thrive constructively when </v>
<v Speaker 4>accompanied by other rights,</v>

2317
01:55:05.790 --> 01:55:09.480
<v Speaker 4>including the equality rights of equity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>diversity,</v>

2318
01:55:09.481 --> 01:55:10.950
<v Speaker 4>and inclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>

2319
01:55:10.980 --> 01:55:15.980
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so now you no longer have free </v>

2320
01:55:15.980 --> 01:55:15.980
<v Speaker 4>expression and that's the snake in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>garden right there.</v>

2321
01:55:15.980 --> 01:55:15.980
<v Speaker 4>Eating that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2322
01:55:15.990 --> 01:55:17.130
<v Speaker 4>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this,</v>

2323
01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:18.300
<v Speaker 4>but how.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean those,</v>

2324
01:55:18.330 --> 01:55:21.150
<v Speaker 4>those are so complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's individual rights and group.</v>

2325
01:55:21.510 --> 01:55:26.510
<v Speaker 7>There's positive rights and negative </v>
<v Speaker 7>rights and they're all in this salad </v>

2326
01:55:26.510 --> 01:55:29.250
<v Speaker 7>with no guidance as to how you're going </v>
<v Speaker 7>to trade them off against each other.</v>

2327
01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:34.280
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like you say it just ad hoc as we </v>

2328
01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:34.280
<v Speaker 7>go forward.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We'll.</v>

2329
01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:38.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was so funny to produce an entire </v>

2330
01:55:38.420 --> 01:55:40.311
<v Speaker 4>document talking about freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 4>expression and then put a sentence like </v>

2331
01:55:40.311 --> 01:55:41.490
<v Speaker 4>that in is a Coda psyllid if.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And by the way also this,</v>

2332
01:55:41.550 --> 01:55:42.660
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a second,</v>

2333
01:55:42.870 --> 01:55:44.400
<v Speaker 4>it's also this,</v>

2334
01:55:44.610 --> 01:55:49.610
<v Speaker 6>it's that little admixture of poison.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It destroys the integrity of the entire </v>

2335
01:55:49.801 --> 01:55:50.820
<v Speaker 6>argument and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

2336
01:55:50.850 --> 01:55:55.850
<v Speaker 6>and to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and to put all those words in their </v>

2337
01:55:55.850 --> 01:55:55.850
<v Speaker 6>diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2338
01:55:55.850 --> 01:55:55.950
<v Speaker 6>What the hell do you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

2339
01:55:56.340 --> 01:56:01.340
<v Speaker 6>Inclusivity or.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a word that really that's when I </v>

2340
01:56:01.340 --> 01:56:04.521
<v Speaker 6>really have trouble with because it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>very difficult to understand even what </v>

2341
01:56:04.521 --> 01:56:07.431
<v Speaker 6>that means and equity equity is equality</v>
<v Speaker 6>of outcome and so that's an impossible </v>

2342
01:56:07.981 --> 01:56:12.981
<v Speaker 6>goal to begin with because it multiplies</v>
<v Speaker 6>in difficulty as you add number of </v>

2343
01:56:13.171 --> 01:56:14.910
<v Speaker 6>measurement dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2344
01:56:15.330 --> 01:56:20.330
<v Speaker 6>So.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's the intersectionality </v>

2345
01:56:20.330 --> 01:56:20.330
<v Speaker 6>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so to speak.</v>

2346
01:56:20.330 --> 01:56:20.330
<v Speaker 6>So.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All right,</v>

2347
01:56:20.330 --> 01:56:21.390
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well with the task force,</v>

2348
01:56:21.391 --> 01:56:26.391
<v Speaker 6>the interesting thing is we'll didn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>want to sit on it because having looked </v>

2349
01:56:26.581 --> 01:56:27.710
<v Speaker 6>at what had happened,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2350
01:56:27.711 --> 01:56:30.480
<v Speaker 6>I suppose it was the experience at UBC </v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

2351
01:56:30.980 --> 01:56:34.050
<v Speaker 6>well I just saw big arguments happening </v>
<v Speaker 6>with no,</v>

2352
01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:37.380
<v Speaker 6>no possibility of a constructive outcome</v>
<v Speaker 6>and so.</v>

2353
01:56:37.380 --> 01:56:41.790
<v Speaker 6>But I was more hopeful and I understand </v>
<v Speaker 6>wills position completely,</v>

2354
01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:43.230
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

2355
01:56:43.231 --> 01:56:48.231
<v Speaker 6>Well it's easy as a faculty member to </v>
<v Speaker 6>get pulled into interminable </v>

2356
01:56:48.231 --> 01:56:49.710
<v Speaker 6>administrative duties that have no </v>
<v Speaker 6>positive outcome whatsoever.</v>

2357
01:56:49.711 --> 01:56:51.510
<v Speaker 6>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's pretty much par for the course.</v>

2358
01:56:51.540 --> 01:56:52.370
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he makes the,</v>

2359
01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:55.530
<v Speaker 6>I mean your most compelling argument.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well to one,</v>

2360
01:56:55.620 --> 01:56:59.550
<v Speaker 6>look what happened at UBC and two were </v>
<v Speaker 6>already in a compromised position.</v>

2361
01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:01.380
<v Speaker 6>You mean what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what more can you want?</v>

2362
01:57:01.860 --> 01:57:03.580
<v Speaker 6>And I get that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I,</v>

2363
01:57:03.690 --> 01:57:07.560
<v Speaker 6>I have let my name stand for nomination.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2364
01:57:07.590 --> 01:57:08.880
<v Speaker 6>we'll see this week.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess,</v>

2365
01:57:08.881 --> 01:57:12.630
<v Speaker 6>whether or not I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if I'll get voted.</v>

2366
01:57:12.660 --> 01:57:14.940
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the things we should find out and</v>

2367
01:57:14.970 --> 01:57:19.970
<v Speaker 6>publicize is whether any people who have</v>
<v Speaker 6>a strong free speech orientation will </v>

2368
01:57:19.970 --> 01:57:22.060
<v Speaker 6>end up on that task force.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean that,</v>

2369
01:57:22.290 --> 01:57:24.410
<v Speaker 6>that's absolutely critical.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Important.</v>

2370
01:57:24.420 --> 01:57:29.420
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they'll certainly get their work done </v>

2371
01:57:29.420 --> 01:57:31.131
<v Speaker 6>quickly if no one running the free </v>
<v Speaker 6>speech side is on it because they'll </v>

2372
01:57:31.131 --> 01:57:31.131
<v Speaker 6>just say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

2373
01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:36.200
<v Speaker 6>But maybe they'll have to create a list </v>
<v Speaker 6>of their own about what can't be talked </v>

2374
01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:36.200
<v Speaker 6>about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2375
01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:37.020
<v Speaker 6>Who knows where that will go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2376
01:57:37.021 --> 01:57:41.310
<v Speaker 6>and one thing that strikes me though is </v>
<v Speaker 6>just the disregard for history,</v>

2377
01:57:41.540 --> 01:57:46.540
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people who are marginalized or would be </v>

2378
01:57:46.540 --> 01:57:50.601
<v Speaker 6>considered in the marginalized group.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If we look at how did they get the </v>

2379
01:57:50.601 --> 01:57:52.200
<v Speaker 6>rights that they have today,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2380
01:57:52.470 --> 01:57:56.250
<v Speaker 6>How did that happen was because of free </v>
<v Speaker 6>expression,</v>

2381
01:57:56.280 --> 01:57:57.180
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Actually,</v>

2382
01:57:58.110 --> 01:58:01.040
<v Speaker 6>the easy case to make for free speech is</v>
<v Speaker 6>left wing.</v>

2383
01:58:01.300 --> 01:58:06.300
<v Speaker 6>It's like powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People don't need their free speech </v>

2384
01:58:06.300 --> 01:58:06.300
<v Speaker 6>protected.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're powerful,</v>

2385
01:58:06.300 --> 01:58:10.820
<v Speaker 6>they're rich.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They can say whatever the hell they </v>

2386
01:58:10.820 --> 01:58:12.381
<v Speaker 6>want.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's people who are precisely </v>

2387
01:58:12.381 --> 01:58:13.020
<v Speaker 6>marginalized and oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who need all the protection of the law.</v>

2388
01:58:13.021 --> 01:58:14.420
<v Speaker 6>Of course they want to weight it against</v>
<v Speaker 6>saying,</v>

2389
01:58:14.421 --> 01:58:19.421
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we want to have people without power to </v>

2390
01:58:19.421 --> 01:58:20.970
<v Speaker 6>have the freedom of expression,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but let's make this a quicker process by</v>

2391
01:58:20.971 --> 01:58:24.930
<v Speaker 6>making sure those that have power can't </v>
<v Speaker 6>speak whoever those who have power,</v>

2392
01:58:25.010 --> 01:58:27.180
<v Speaker 6>it's not just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2393
01:58:27.181 --> 01:58:27.960
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could say,</v>

2394
01:58:27.961 --> 01:58:32.961
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wouldn't it be wonderful if those who </v>

2395
01:58:32.961 --> 01:58:32.961
<v Speaker 6>had unfair power weren't allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 6>speak?</v>

2396
01:58:32.961 --> 01:58:32.961
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2397
01:58:32.961 --> 01:58:37.640
<v Speaker 6>maybe it wouldn't be wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but who the hell is going to decide who </v>

2398
01:58:37.640 --> 01:58:40.650
<v Speaker 6>has power and who has unfair power?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like the devil's in the details there.</v>

2399
01:58:40.990 --> 01:58:45.940
<v Speaker 6>So the only fair application of this </v>
<v Speaker 6>principle is to let everybody have equal</v>

2400
01:58:45.941 --> 01:58:48.970
<v Speaker 6>opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not equal outcome by the way.</v>

2401
01:58:49.030 --> 01:58:50.680
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the free market solution,</v>

2402
01:58:50.681 --> 01:58:55.681
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because you can't determine these by </v>

2403
01:58:55.681 --> 01:58:56.020
<v Speaker 6>central Fiat because it's technically </v>
<v Speaker 6>impossible,</v>

2404
01:58:56.110 --> 01:58:59.020
<v Speaker 6>which is actually something </v>
<v Speaker 6>postmodernist should know because that's</v>

2405
01:58:59.021 --> 01:59:01.660
<v Speaker 6>actually one of the logical consequences</v>
<v Speaker 6>of their philosophy.</v>

2406
01:59:01.940 --> 01:59:06.940
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Things are too complicated to decide by </v>

2407
01:59:06.940 --> 01:59:06.940
<v Speaker 6>Fiat in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but.</v>

2408
01:59:06.940 --> 01:59:11.240
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is there anything else that you guys </v>

2409
01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:11.240
<v Speaker 6>want to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

2410
01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:14.350
<v Speaker 6>that you've observed as a consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 6>this Lindsay shepherd of fair or that or</v>

2411
01:59:14.351 --> 01:59:17.290
<v Speaker 6>that you're hopeful about or pessimistic</v>
<v Speaker 6>about what,</v>

2412
01:59:17.340 --> 01:59:18.550
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's the,</v>

2413
01:59:18.970 --> 01:59:21.610
<v Speaker 6>how do we solve this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just the way we're solving it.</v>

2414
01:59:21.940 --> 01:59:25.570
<v Speaker 6>This is the way to solve it is to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is to have W.</v>

2415
01:59:25.780 --> 01:59:28.720
<v Speaker 6>I think this is a textbook case of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>utility of free speech.</v>

2416
01:59:29.380 --> 01:59:31.600
<v Speaker 6>Shepherd was able to make her case </v>
<v Speaker 6>publicly.</v>

2417
01:59:31.720 --> 01:59:34.840
<v Speaker 6>There's been a huge debate about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's been some moves made on the part</v>

2418
01:59:34.841 --> 01:59:38.200
<v Speaker 6>of the university that looked positive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We've got ample opportunity.</v>

2419
01:59:38.201 --> 01:59:40.750
<v Speaker 6>Everyone has ample opportunity to have </v>
<v Speaker 6>their voice heard.</v>

2420
01:59:40.751 --> 01:59:42.220
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this video we're making tonight,</v>

2421
01:59:42.221 --> 01:59:44.890
<v Speaker 6>I'll probably be watched by 150,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>

2422
01:59:45.070 --> 01:59:50.070
<v Speaker 6>so like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and we had a perfectly reasonable </v>

2423
01:59:50.070 --> 01:59:50.070
<v Speaker 6>discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2424
01:59:50.070 --> 01:59:52.020
<v Speaker 6>I think we gave credit where credit was </v>
<v Speaker 6>due with regards to this document and,</v>

2425
01:59:52.230 --> 01:59:57.230
<v Speaker 6>and are jointly hopeful that something </v>
<v Speaker 6>positive will come of it and made some </v>

2426
01:59:57.230 --> 02:00:02.131
<v Speaker 6>pointed critiques about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>about what it does contain and what it </v>

2427
02:00:02.131 --> 02:00:05.911
<v Speaker 6>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we don't want to underestimate the </v>

2428
02:00:05.911 --> 02:00:08.401
<v Speaker 6>utility of doing these things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's useful and I think the fact that </v>

2429
02:00:08.401 --> 02:00:11.371
<v Speaker 6>you guys have this little cabal of </v>
<v Speaker 6>people at Wilfrid laurier who are </v>

2430
02:00:11.371 --> 02:00:14.791
<v Speaker 6>willing to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was shocked when when you wrote that </v>

2431
02:00:14.791 --> 02:00:15.900
<v Speaker 6>op ad and when the Toronto Star </v>
<v Speaker 6>published it,</v>

2432
02:00:15.910 --> 02:00:20.910
<v Speaker 6>I mean nothing like that from an </v>
<v Speaker 6>academic happened in relationship to me </v>

2433
02:00:20.921 --> 02:00:25.921
<v Speaker 6>last year and Bill [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 6>we've seen such uniformity of outcry </v>

2434
02:00:25.921 --> 02:00:30.270
<v Speaker 6>about this from all the newspapers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>glove star son,</v>

2435
02:00:30.300 --> 02:00:35.300
<v Speaker 6>which,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which really just shows you the </v>

2436
02:00:35.300 --> 02:00:35.860
<v Speaker 6>disconnect between what is happening in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the academy and what is happening.</v>

2437
02:00:35.980 --> 02:00:38.320
<v Speaker 6>It's a disconnect of staggering </v>
<v Speaker 6>magnitude.</v>

2438
02:00:38.680 --> 02:00:40.480
<v Speaker 6>People outside the academy say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2439
02:00:40.500 --> 02:00:45.500
<v Speaker 6>how can you believe that they have what </v>
<v Speaker 6>they've been saying is really this </v>

2440
02:00:45.500 --> 02:00:47.290
<v Speaker 6>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this actually happened.</v>

2441
02:00:47.380 --> 02:00:51.760
<v Speaker 6>That's the universal response and and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you know the response on the campuses as</v>

2442
02:00:52.210 --> 02:00:52.630
<v Speaker 6>well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2443
02:00:52.631 --> 02:00:56.020
<v Speaker 6>It happened and we were right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have a solution.</v>

2444
02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:58.150
<v Speaker 6>I have a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's not a solution,</v>

2445
02:00:58.151 --> 02:01:02.590
<v Speaker 6>but it's A.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I call it an inoculant actually.</v>

2446
02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:07.800
<v Speaker 6>So yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's get the statement for freedom of </v>

2447
02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:09.370
<v Speaker 6>expression at our university and similar</v>
<v Speaker 6>statements at all universities.</v>

2448
02:01:09.550 --> 02:01:12.550
<v Speaker 6>Why the federal government is not tying </v>
<v Speaker 6>funding to this.</v>

2449
02:01:12.551 --> 02:01:17.551
<v Speaker 6>I know that the Conservatives Med </v>
<v Speaker 6>suggestion that I made to the </v>

2450
02:01:17.551 --> 02:01:17.551
<v Speaker 6>conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well this is,</v>

2451
02:01:17.551 --> 02:01:18.880
<v Speaker 6>this is what needs to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but in addition to that,</v>

2452
02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:24.120
<v Speaker 6>I think that young people and parents of</v>
<v Speaker 6>young people need to look at what's </v>

2453
02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:28.471
<v Speaker 6>happening and they need to start </v>
<v Speaker 6>educating their kids at home and they </v>

2454
02:01:28.471 --> 02:01:28.471
<v Speaker 6>need to start.</v>

2455
02:01:28.471 --> 02:01:32.800
<v Speaker 6>And I've written several op-eds where </v>
<v Speaker 6>I've said people ask me,</v>

2456
02:01:32.801 --> 02:01:37.801
<v Speaker 6>what is the solution that I say?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Start watching the videos of Jordan </v>

2457
02:01:37.801 --> 02:01:38.950
<v Speaker 6>Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Start watching the videos.</v>

2458
02:01:39.070 --> 02:01:40.460
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's Jonathan Heit,</v>

2459
02:01:40.490 --> 02:01:41.180
<v Speaker 6>Jonathan.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hi.</v>

2460
02:01:41.181 --> 02:01:43.270
<v Speaker 6>You Bet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look into the Heterodox Academy.</v>

2461
02:01:43.310 --> 02:01:44.750
<v Speaker 6>They know what they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who,</v>

2462
02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:48.770
<v Speaker 6>who definitely are scholars of repute,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2463
02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:50.870
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they are moderate in the,</v>

2464
02:01:50.900 --> 02:01:52.790
<v Speaker 6>like incredibly civil.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2465
02:01:52.910 --> 02:01:55.340
<v Speaker 6>there are also some people outside of </v>
<v Speaker 6>academia.</v>

2466
02:01:55.341 --> 02:01:56.090
<v Speaker 6>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

02:02:13.551 --> 02:02:15.470
<v Speaker 6>know she knows you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She was at one of your rallies.</v>

2473
02:02:15.471 --> 02:02:18.760
<v Speaker 6>I spotted a video there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She is in the background there.</v>

2474
02:02:18.830 --> 02:02:23.830
<v Speaker 6>Another young lady as a woman who is her</v>
<v Speaker 6>name is roaming millennial.</v>

2475
02:02:24.260 --> 02:02:24.500
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2476
02:02:24.500 --> 02:02:26.270
<v Speaker 6>I don't roaming millennial.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'd been on her show.</v>

2477
02:02:26.300 --> 02:02:28.220
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you bet.</v>

<v Speaker 6>That girl,</v>

2480
02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:34.190
<v Speaker 6>you bet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I would say start watching these.</v>

2481
02:02:34.620 --> 02:02:39.620
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well the young people are watching them </v>

2482
02:02:39.620 --> 02:02:39.620
<v Speaker 6>in droves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2483
02:02:39.620 --> 02:02:39.620
<v Speaker 6>she has a big following,</v>
<v Speaker 6>roaming millennial,</v>

2484
02:02:39.620 --> 02:02:44.111
<v Speaker 6>and I'm grateful for that because in </v>
<v Speaker 6>fact when these students go into the </v>

2485
02:02:44.111 --> 02:02:47.321
<v Speaker 6>university classroom,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if they choose to go into the arts or </v>

2486
02:02:47.321 --> 02:02:49.901
<v Speaker 6>the humanities,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're going to go in with knowledge </v>

2487
02:02:49.901 --> 02:02:52.810
<v Speaker 6>where they can say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I realize it's tough to challenge a </v>

2488
02:02:52.810 --> 02:02:53.150
<v Speaker 6>professor,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but start a facebook group and say,</v>

2489
02:02:53.210 --> 02:02:58.210
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>did you know that there are other ideas </v>

2490
02:02:58.210 --> 02:03:00.521
<v Speaker 6>to do?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know that there's an opposite side </v>

2491
02:03:00.521 --> 02:03:00.521
<v Speaker 6>of this debate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2492
02:03:00.521 --> 02:03:03.950
<v Speaker 6>we should.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Or we could also encourage parents who </v>

2493
02:03:03.950 --> 02:03:06.101
<v Speaker 6>might be listening or or students </v>
<v Speaker 6>thinking about going to university who </v>

2494
02:03:06.101 --> 02:03:09.671
<v Speaker 6>might be listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that check to see where the </v>

2495
02:03:09.671 --> 02:03:12.731
<v Speaker 6>university stands on free speech and if </v>
<v Speaker 6>they dampen down their support for free </v>

2496
02:03:12.731 --> 02:03:14.840
<v Speaker 6>speech and for your inquiry with </v>
<v Speaker 6>statements about diversity,</v>

2497
02:03:14.841 --> 02:03:17.600
<v Speaker 6>inclusivity and equity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then go somewhere else.</v>

2498
02:03:17.660 --> 02:03:20.120
<v Speaker 6>It's a worry.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Another thing,</v>

2499
02:03:20.300 --> 02:03:25.300
<v Speaker 6>and this is just beginning in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we have a society for academic freedom </v>

2500
02:03:25.300 --> 02:03:27.890
<v Speaker 6>and scholarship that professors can join</v>
<v Speaker 6>if a,</v>

2501
02:03:27.930 --> 02:03:32.930
<v Speaker 6>if a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>sorry if a professor has joined the </v>

2502
02:03:32.930 --> 02:03:33.110
<v Speaker 6>Society for academic freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 6>scholarship,</v>

2503
02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:36.980
<v Speaker 6>you can be pretty sure they are going to</v>
<v Speaker 6>be wanting to give you both sides of the</v>

2504
02:03:36.981 --> 02:03:40.640
<v Speaker 6>story.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that's not a bad check either for.</v>

2505
02:03:40.670 --> 02:03:45.670
<v Speaker 6>Do they have to do their research though</v>
<v Speaker 6>the students to do diligence while </v>

2506
02:03:45.670 --> 02:03:45.710
<v Speaker 6>that's good,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it'll educate them.</v>

2507
02:03:46.130 --> 02:03:51.130
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean Lindsay Shepherd definitely got </v>

2508
02:03:51.130 --> 02:03:51.130
<v Speaker 6>educated over the last two months.</v>

<v Speaker 6>auto ethnography for you.</v>

2512
02:04:00.650 --> 02:04:05.650
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I caused an international scandal by </v>

2513
02:04:05.650 --> 02:04:05.650
<v Speaker 6>just revealing what had actually </v>
<v Speaker 6>happened.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Well to talk to me first of all,</v>

2518
02:04:16.311 --> 02:04:21.311

<v Speaker 6>Certainly not on record and certainly </v>

2519
02:04:21.311 --> 02:04:21.980
<v Speaker 6>not common for them to be writing and </v>
<v Speaker 6>speaking openly about such issues.</v>

2520
02:04:21.981 --> 02:04:24.500
