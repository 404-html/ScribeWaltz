1
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.330
<v Speaker 1>We talk about phenomenology last time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

2
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.880
<v Speaker 1>I tried to make the case that</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenology,</v>

3
00:00:20.801 --> 00:00:23.830
<v Speaker 1>at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was an attempt to include</v>

4
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.883
<v Speaker 1>the entire domain of subjective </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience inside the definition of </v>

5
00:00:30.341 --> 00:00:31.174
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

6
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.333
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.033
<v Speaker 1>When Roger's talked about mental health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was speaking of something that that </v>

8
00:00:46.061 --> 00:00:51.061
<v Speaker 1>superseded just rational coherence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogers also touched on</v>

9
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.270
<v Speaker 1>a topic that's become very well </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed since the time of Rogers,</v>

10
00:00:58.271 --> 00:01:00.430
<v Speaker 1>which is the topic of embodied </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognition.</v>

11
00:01:00.431 --> 00:01:01.264
<v Speaker 1>It's become increasingly clear</v>
<v Speaker 1>to artificial intelligence researchers </v>

12
00:01:06.611 --> 00:01:07.444
<v Speaker 1>particularly</v>

13
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.253
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

14
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:13.483
<v Speaker 1>the enlightenment idea of rationality as</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a disembodied sort of spiritual </v>

15
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:23.120
<v Speaker 1>function is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is wrong in principle.</v>

16
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.020
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the brain sets itself up</v>

17
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.413
<v Speaker 1>with the body is the way that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed when we were talking about </v>

18
00:01:34.311 --> 00:01:35.144
<v Speaker 1>piaget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that the mind is built from motor </v>

19
00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:39.974
<v Speaker 1>actions up and the concepts that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind uses aren't abstract categories </v>

20
00:01:45.141 --> 00:01:49.100
<v Speaker 1>that describe reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're more like tools that allow us to</v>

21
00:01:49.101 --> 00:01:52.640
<v Speaker 1>do things in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they're predicated,</v>

22
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.480
<v Speaker 1>their validity is predicated on the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have a body.</v>

23
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.270
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that Rogers was </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to emphasize,</v>

24
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.870
<v Speaker 1>and I think there's a long history of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this in</v>

25
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.573
<v Speaker 2>in</v>

26
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.910
<v Speaker 1>western thought over the last few </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand years,</v>

27
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.620
<v Speaker 1>that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are faculties of,</v>

28
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.203
<v Speaker 1>of apprehension that are higher than </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationality and some of those are </v>

29
00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:25.164
<v Speaker 1>embodied.</v>

30
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.063
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

31
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:29.543
<v Speaker 1>it's a variant in Floridian theory </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the Friday ends of course </v>

32
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:32.184
<v Speaker 1>thought that it was necessary to attend </v>
<v Speaker 1>to emotions and motivational states and </v>

33
00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:36.894
<v Speaker 1>to integrate them with the ego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it takes that idea further in some </v>

34
00:02:42.301 --> 00:02:46.830
<v Speaker 1>sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>by treating the inputs of the body.</v>

35
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.383
<v Speaker 1>So motivational states and emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also perhaps the capacity to mirror </v>

36
00:02:51.301 --> 00:02:55.830
<v Speaker 1>other people as a prerequisite for </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental health.</v>

37
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 1>And so the other thing that Rogers </v>
<v Speaker 1>emphasizes</v>

38
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.053
<v Speaker 1>is to pay attention to how it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>your experiential field is manifesting </v>

39
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 1>itself while you speak and interact with</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

40
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.100
<v Speaker 1>And he was hoping and pr and striving </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards a kind of unification.</v>

41
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.023
<v Speaker 1>It was analogous to the unification that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are described to you that young talked </v>

42
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:25.370
<v Speaker 1>about in his last book</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

43
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.343
<v Speaker 1>There's another practical element to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this that I should tell you that that I </v>

44
00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:29.704
<v Speaker 1>think is unbelievably useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked last time a little bit about </v>

45
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:38.281
<v Speaker 1>the necessity of listening to people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques that you could use to do that</v>

46
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.080
<v Speaker 1>in the effort to improve your </v>
<v Speaker 1>communications and and,</v>

47
00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.123
<v Speaker 1>and also to improve the degree to which </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were gathering information that was </v>

48
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 1>practically useful to you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrective.</v>

49
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 1>But with the Rogerian techniques to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>

50
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:53.854
<v Speaker 1>you could do the same thing with regards</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the relationship between your </v>

51
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.993
<v Speaker 1>intellectual rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of your knowledge as </v>

52
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:03.184
<v Speaker 1>represented at the highest level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>verbal abstraction and the platform on </v>

53
00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:12.100
<v Speaker 1>which that knowledge is hypothetically </v>
<v Speaker 1>implemented.</v>

54
00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:16.960
<v Speaker 1>So you can imagine in the [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>mode of development,</v>

55
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.063
<v Speaker 1>you start to learn how to move and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>those movements are chained in evermore </v>

56
00:04:21.941 --> 00:04:26.941
<v Speaker 1>complex sequences and those sequences </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to become representable abstractly</v>

57
00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:29.950
<v Speaker 1>so that you can describe yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

58
00:04:29.951 --> 00:04:30.784
<v Speaker 1>as a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And hypothetically as you decompose the </v>

59
00:04:34.181 --> 00:04:37.180
<v Speaker 1>idea of good person down towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>specific actions,</v>

60
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.343
<v Speaker 1>that whole hierarchy is internally </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistent in that you're a good person </v>

61
00:04:43.421 --> 00:04:47.020
<v Speaker 1>in your self representation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also enact all the things that a</v>

62
00:04:47.021 --> 00:04:47.854
<v Speaker 1>good person would enact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's no flaws in the entire </v>

63
00:04:50.591 --> 00:04:51.424
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the weird thing about having an </v>

64
00:04:54.581 --> 00:04:59.581
<v Speaker 1>intelligence that's dissociable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that you can think up things</v>

65
00:04:59.771 --> 00:05:00.604
<v Speaker 1>without acting them out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you can also formulate self </v>

66
00:05:03.131 --> 00:05:03.964
<v Speaker 1>representations in ideas that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>fully integrated with the manner in </v>

67
00:05:09.701 --> 00:05:10.960
<v Speaker 1>which you actually act.</v>

68
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.230
<v Speaker 1>So you can have a concept of yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

69
00:05:13.231 --> 00:05:18.231
<v Speaker 1>and even an ideological framework that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>only vaguely related to your,</v>

70
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.780
<v Speaker 1>to the programming that's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantiated in your body.</v>

71
00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:25.510
<v Speaker 1>And Rogers would consider that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

72
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.130
<v Speaker 1>he has a technical term for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

73
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.020
<v Speaker 1>well it's a form of internal disharmony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>non congruent.</v>

74
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.720
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

75
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.360
<v Speaker 1>that's his term and the non congruent </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

76
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.920
<v Speaker 1>A very interesting one because in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience you can feel it.</v>

77
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.253
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's something that you could try </v>

78
00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:45.994
<v Speaker 1>as an experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's as effective and </v>

79
00:05:48.101 --> 00:05:51.010
<v Speaker 1>experiment as the listening experiment </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we discussed last time.</v>

80
00:05:51.011 --> 00:05:55.840
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very common for modern people,</v>

81
00:05:55.841 --> 00:05:57.800
<v Speaker 1>especially intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern people,</v>

82
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.520
<v Speaker 1>to identify themselves with the contents</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their intellect.</v>

83
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.470
<v Speaker 1>But that's a strange thing to do in many</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense in many ways because first of all,</v>

84
00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:08.780
<v Speaker 1>obviously you're not just the content of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your intellect,</v>

85
00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:09.614
<v Speaker 1>your also your emotions and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations and your body and so forth </v>

86
00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:14.390
<v Speaker 1>and your embeddedness within a social </v>
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>

87
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:15.643
<v Speaker 1>But especially if you're intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tempting to identify yourself with </v>

88
00:06:19.131 --> 00:06:19.964
<v Speaker 1>the contents of your intellect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's no reason to assume </v>

89
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:23.174
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever that those contents are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact congruent with the programming of </v>

90
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:29.780
<v Speaker 1>your body or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even with its natural inclinations.</v>

91
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:34.781
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can abstract also means that you can</v>

92
00:06:35.451 --> 00:06:36.284
<v Speaker 1>learn abstract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means you can pull in concepts </v>

93
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:39.374
<v Speaker 1>from the world at a level of abstraction</v>
<v Speaker 1>that may have virtually nothing to do </v>

94
00:06:42.621 --> 00:06:43.454
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's certainly the case if you're </v>

95
00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:49.370
<v Speaker 1>educated because you read all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and the,</v>

96
00:06:49.371 --> 00:06:50.204
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reading and all the investigating </v>

97
00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:53.234
<v Speaker 1>that you do at an abstract level allows </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to have theories about being in </v>

98
00:06:56.481 --> 00:06:57.314
<v Speaker 1>theories about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's no necessity that those </v>

99
00:06:59.931 --> 00:07:00.764
<v Speaker 1>theories about being in yourself have </v>
<v Speaker 1>any basis in who or what you actually </v>

100
00:07:04.251 --> 00:07:06.740
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that can,</v>

101
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:07.993
<v Speaker 1>that makes you into the inauthentic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the existential perspective and </v>

102
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.340
<v Speaker 1>the Rogerian perspective would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>incongruent.</v>

103
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:15.383
<v Speaker 1>There are,</v>

104
00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.473
<v Speaker 1>you're not a singular entity at all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple levels at which you exist and </v>

105
00:07:22.321 --> 00:07:24.150
<v Speaker 1>that can cause conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

106
00:07:24.151 --> 00:07:29.151
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're acting out in ideology </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're convinced of its rational</v>

107
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.860
<v Speaker 1>integrity and coherence and utility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that utility,</v>

108
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:37.870
<v Speaker 1>that ideology doesn't fulfill you as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

109
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.610
<v Speaker 1>That's certainly an existential claim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fundamental existential claim.</v>

110
00:07:41.611 --> 00:07:42.444
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we'll talk about in in the next </v>

111
00:07:44.041 --> 00:07:44.874
<v Speaker 1>lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are thinkers like soldier Nansen </v>

112
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:52.070
<v Speaker 1>who've ascribed the worst catastrophes </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the 20th century to exactly that kind</v>

113
00:07:52.411 --> 00:07:53.244
<v Speaker 1>of inauthenticity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the development of a coherent </v>

114
00:07:55.201 --> 00:07:58.410
<v Speaker 1>and rational ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say like a Communist ideology.</v>

115
00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:01.830
<v Speaker 1>And then the attempt to force that on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and and on people,</v>

116
00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:02.813
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that the rational </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulation and the reality of the </v>

117
00:08:05.581 --> 00:08:07.860
<v Speaker 1>people in the world have very little in </v>
<v Speaker 1>common.</v>

118
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:10.803
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you detect your own </v>

119
00:08:11.921 --> 00:08:14.770
<v Speaker 1>inauthenticity or your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own incongruent?</v>

120
00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:16.563
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogers had this idea that he called </v>

121
00:08:18.521 --> 00:08:23.521
<v Speaker 1>subception which was maybe something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you might regard as a sixth sense.</v>

122
00:08:24.281 --> 00:08:25.114
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like a proprietors centric </v>
<v Speaker 1>perception and that's the perception </v>

123
00:08:31.361 --> 00:08:32.194
<v Speaker 1>that you have of your body as it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>reacting and localized in time and </v>

124
00:08:36.701 --> 00:08:37.534
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's sort of like touch the </v>

125
00:08:39.311 --> 00:08:40.610
<v Speaker 1>feeling but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

126
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:45.620
<v Speaker 1>it's your sense of how you're reacting </v>
<v Speaker 1>internally and where you are.</v>

127
00:08:45.621 --> 00:08:49.420
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that is subserved by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>autonomic nervous system,</v>

128
00:08:49.421 --> 00:08:52.900
<v Speaker 1>which is reporting to you about various </v>
<v Speaker 1>states of being in your body.</v>

129
00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:01.320
<v Speaker 1>Rogers believed that you could use the </v>
<v Speaker 1>information that's being provided to you</v>

130
00:09:01.991 --> 00:09:02.824
<v Speaker 1>from your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of bottom up to determine when you </v>

131
00:09:05.921 --> 00:09:06.754
<v Speaker 1>were being inauthentic or non congruent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've thought about this for a long </v>

132
00:09:10.991 --> 00:09:14.350
<v Speaker 1>time and tried to sort it out in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>practical manner.</v>

133
00:09:14.351 --> 00:09:15.184
<v Speaker 1>And what I've concluded is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could try this for a couple of </v>

134
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.050
<v Speaker 1>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an extremely interesting exercise.</v>

135
00:09:20.051 --> 00:09:25.051
<v Speaker 1>So you sorta have to detach yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>from your thoughts and your and what you</v>

136
00:09:25.571 --> 00:09:27.460
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you got to assume,</v>

137
00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:28.593
<v Speaker 1>you start by assuming that what you say </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what you think is not necessarily </v>

138
00:09:31.091 --> 00:09:31.924
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course that's just the case </v>

139
00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.650
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of what you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

140
00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:36.723
<v Speaker 1>most of what you think and most of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you say are the opinions of other </v>

141
00:09:39.521 --> 00:09:40.354
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are things you've read or things </v>

142
00:09:41.531 --> 00:09:42.364
<v Speaker 1>people have told you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that that's a benefit in some </v>

143
00:09:44.531 --> 00:09:48.100
<v Speaker 1>ways because you get all those thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 1>that other people have spent a long time</v>

144
00:09:48.101 --> 00:09:50.650
<v Speaker 1>formulating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a disadvantage in that it's not</v>

145
00:09:50.651 --> 00:09:53.230
<v Speaker 1>exactly you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

146
00:09:53.231 --> 00:09:57.310
<v Speaker 1>so you detach yourself from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're no longer your thoughts or or,</v>

147
00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.293
<v Speaker 1>or the things that you say or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're no longer all of them and now </v>

148
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.370
<v Speaker 1>what you're going to try to find out is</v>

149
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.053
<v Speaker 1>which of your thoughts and things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you say are you and maybe so you not </v>

150
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.100
<v Speaker 1>utilize the rest or maybe so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can correct the rest because they're not</v>

151
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:18.060
<v Speaker 1>representative of yourself as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an integrated being.</v>

152
00:10:18.061 --> 00:10:19.680
<v Speaker 1>They don't take everything into account.</v>

153
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:24.573
<v Speaker 1>My sense has been that you can tell when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying something that's not </v>

154
00:10:27.311 --> 00:10:32.170
<v Speaker 1>authentic by feeling out whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes you weak or strong.</v>

155
00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:33.993
<v Speaker 1>Now you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes when you're conversing with </v>

156
00:10:35.471 --> 00:10:36.304
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say something that embarrasses </v>

157
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.010
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Nisha said,</v>

158
00:10:39.011 --> 00:10:39.844
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone has perjured themselves at </v>

159
00:10:42.101 --> 00:10:44.920
<v Speaker 1>least once in the attempt to maintain </v>
<v Speaker 1>their good name,</v>

160
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.230
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an exact quote,</v>

161
00:10:47.231 --> 00:10:48.580
<v Speaker 1>but I've got the gist of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

162
00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:49.773
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you're saying things to impress</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone or you're saying things to </v>

163
00:10:52.841 --> 00:10:56.350
<v Speaker 1>remain part of your political group or </v>
<v Speaker 1>your social group or whatever.</v>

164
00:10:56.351 --> 00:10:57.184
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you have attributes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal attributes that might be </v>

165
00:10:59.861 --> 00:11:03.430
<v Speaker 1>positive that you're ashamed of and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to speak about them.</v>

166
00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.280
<v Speaker 1>So there's a falseness about yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation,</v>

167
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.983
<v Speaker 1>watch for two weeks and see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a rule that if you start to say </v>

168
00:11:14.061 --> 00:11:14.894
<v Speaker 1>something and it makes you feel weak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to describe exactly what that </v>

169
00:11:18.441 --> 00:11:19.274
<v Speaker 1>means to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it means is that I can feel things </v>

170
00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:23.653
<v Speaker 1>coming apart sort of in my mid section.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's an autonomic phenomena </v>

171
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:33.820
<v Speaker 1>and the subjective senses of false hood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I've just stepped off to solid</v>

172
00:11:35.421 --> 00:11:38.510
<v Speaker 1>ground and onto something that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>support me well,</v>

173
00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.450
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels like a self betrayal.</v>

174
00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:42.284
<v Speaker 1>So that's existential inauthenticity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can feel it right away and then the </v>

175
00:11:45.051 --> 00:11:47.870
<v Speaker 1>rule is shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that happens,</v>

176
00:11:47.871 --> 00:11:48.704
<v Speaker 1>stop talking and then feel around and </v>
<v Speaker 1>see if you can find some words that you </v>

177
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:57.130
<v Speaker 1>say in that situation that don't produce</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sensation.</v>

178
00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:58.173
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see this played out in different </v>

179
00:12:01.481 --> 00:12:02.770
<v Speaker 1>forms of drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

180
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.420
<v Speaker 1>there's a scene in the Lord of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rings,</v>

181
00:12:04.421 --> 00:12:08.320
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I believe it's Gollum and Bilbo,</v>

182
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:12.800
<v Speaker 1>it's the Lord of the rings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

183
00:12:12.801 --> 00:12:13.611
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bill boats,</v>

184
00:12:13.611 --> 00:12:14.444
<v Speaker 1>Lord of the rings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the hobbit because the hobbits </v>

185
00:12:15.321 --> 00:12:15.981
<v Speaker 1>Frodo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

186
00:12:15.981 --> 00:12:18.350
<v Speaker 1>So it's Bilbo there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got it wrong.</v>

187
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.120
<v Speaker 1>So the other way around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

188
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:23.360
<v Speaker 1>so gollum and Frodo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

189
00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:24.373
<v Speaker 1>are going across the swamp and the swamp</v>
<v Speaker 1>is full of essentially full of dead </v>

190
00:12:28.401 --> 00:12:29.234
<v Speaker 1>Saul's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they have to step very carefully in </v>

191
00:12:31.491 --> 00:12:32.324
<v Speaker 1>order to not fall off the track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the stones are sort of hidden </v>

192
00:12:34.311 --> 00:12:35.144
<v Speaker 1>underneath the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the implication there is that in </v>

193
00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:40.640
<v Speaker 1>order to follow a trail property,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to pick your,</v>

194
00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.013
<v Speaker 1>your ground very carefully and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to test it to see if it's solid or </v>

195
00:12:44.511 --> 00:12:47.540
<v Speaker 1>you'll slip off into this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well essentially what it is is chaos.</v>

196
00:12:47.541 --> 00:12:48.374
<v Speaker 1>You'll slip off into chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a dramatic representation of </v>

197
00:12:52.281 --> 00:12:54.770
<v Speaker 1>what I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm suggesting to you,</v>

198
00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.840
<v Speaker 1>it's like all you have to do is notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

199
00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.510
<v Speaker 1>and you have to pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

200
00:12:59.511 --> 00:13:00.344
<v Speaker 1>so to some degree what you're doing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact is you're making your capacity to </v>

201
00:13:03.231 --> 00:13:07.280
<v Speaker 1>pay attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super ordinate to your capacity to think</v>

202
00:13:07.281 --> 00:13:08.890
<v Speaker 1>and to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you,</v>

203
00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:09.733
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might ask yourself while exactly </v>

204
00:13:10.881 --> 00:13:11.714
<v Speaker 1>what are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while I said you can identify yourself </v>

205
00:13:13.371 --> 00:13:15.800
<v Speaker 1>with your intellect and that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very common.</v>

206
00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:19.070
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like the worst sin of </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent people,</v>

207
00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:24.760
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't all you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are lots of reasons for making</v>

208
00:13:24.771 --> 00:13:29.270
<v Speaker 1>the assumption that attention is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher order function than intellect.</v>

209
00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.640
<v Speaker 1>Because attention is what teaches </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellect.</v>

210
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:34.670
<v Speaker 1>So if by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you pay very,</v>

211
00:13:34.671 --> 00:13:39.410
<v Speaker 1>very careful attention to what you say </v>
<v Speaker 1>without having the automatic,</v>

212
00:13:39.411 --> 00:13:40.244
<v Speaker 1>without bringing the automatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumption that what you say is you to </v>

213
00:13:43.641 --> 00:13:46.550
<v Speaker 1>bear on the conversation and then also </v>
<v Speaker 1>to feel like you have to defend it.</v>

214
00:13:46.551 --> 00:13:47.384
<v Speaker 1>Once you say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll find very rapidly that very much </v>

215
00:13:49.371 --> 00:13:51.980
<v Speaker 1>of what you think can say has absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do with you.</v>

216
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:53.833
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the dead souls that are in that </v>

217
00:13:56.571 --> 00:13:57.404
<v Speaker 1>little scene that I described to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of manifesting themselves in your </v>

218
00:14:00.441 --> 00:14:01.274
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're dead ideas that other people </v>

219
00:14:02.421 --> 00:14:05.270
<v Speaker 1>have created and some of them might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>applicable to you.</v>

220
00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.133
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might have the right to them so to </v>

221
00:14:08.091 --> 00:14:08.924
<v Speaker 1>speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but lots of the malt and you're using </v>

222
00:14:10.911 --> 00:14:11.744
<v Speaker 1>the words as camouflage or self defense </v>
<v Speaker 1>or as an attempt to attain status and </v>

223
00:14:16.101 --> 00:14:19.130
<v Speaker 1>the status hierarchy or to make yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>look smarter than you are.</v>

224
00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:19.963
<v Speaker 1>Or there's all sorts of reasons or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or to hide what you think from other </v>

225
00:14:23.181 --> 00:14:24.014
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see this and undergraduate essays all </v>

226
00:14:25.641 --> 00:14:26.474
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So cause the essays are full of cliches </v>

227
00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.310
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not all that obvious.</v>

228
00:14:31.311 --> 00:14:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Why a cliche is a bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it cliche is a bad thing.</v>

229
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:37.610
<v Speaker 1>In the same way that being possessed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dead is a bad thing.</v>

230
00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like a cliche isn't you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something else.</v>

231
00:14:41.871 --> 00:14:43.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the other,</v>

232
00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:45.710
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not living.</v>

233
00:14:45.711 --> 00:14:48.860
<v Speaker 1>It has nothing to do with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason that students use</v>

234
00:14:48.861 --> 00:14:49.694
<v Speaker 1>cliches is because it's easier than </v>
<v Speaker 1>using your own genuine creative </v>

235
00:14:53.991 --> 00:14:58.610
<v Speaker 1>formulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can just default to cliche use.</v>

236
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:59.623
<v Speaker 1>But there's something more insidious </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that is that if you write an essay </v>

237
00:15:02.271 --> 00:15:06.110
<v Speaker 1>that's nothing but a string of cliches </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get criticized,</v>

238
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:08.330
<v Speaker 1>then you're not being criticized.</v>

239
00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:13.300
<v Speaker 1>What's being criticized is the cliches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can hide behind that and the the</v>

240
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:15.280
<v Speaker 1>part of you that's wise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

241
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:17.840
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but treacherous thinks,</v>

242
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:19.760
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the criticism doesn't really apply to me</v>

243
00:15:19.761 --> 00:15:20.870
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

244
00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.290
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really say what I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's this kind of sense,</v>

245
00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:25.760
<v Speaker 1>you get that you've gotten away with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

246
00:15:25.761 --> 00:15:28.600
<v Speaker 1>which is a terrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I read undergraduate essays,</v>

247
00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:31.330
<v Speaker 1>what I see very frequently is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the first essay,</v>

248
00:15:31.331 --> 00:15:33.560
<v Speaker 1>it's just nothing but cliches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's awful.</v>

249
00:15:33.561 --> 00:15:34.850
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dull.</v>

250
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:39.020
<v Speaker 1>You can hardly stand reading it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing in it that's gripping or</v>

251
00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:39.854
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe the second essay you can </v>

252
00:15:41.781 --> 00:15:42.614
<v Speaker 1>see there's a layer of cliche and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>now and then the person will be brave </v>

253
00:15:46.401 --> 00:15:49.190
<v Speaker 1>enough to poke up a thought of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own.</v>

254
00:15:49.191 --> 00:15:52.250
<v Speaker 1>It'll just sort of poke up somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe in three pages in,</v>

255
00:15:52.251 --> 00:15:53.084
<v Speaker 1>it's like this little green shoot that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>barely alive and the person is brave </v>

256
00:15:57.561 --> 00:15:59.870
<v Speaker 1>enough to pop it up in the hope that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

257
00:15:59.871 --> 00:16:02.390
<v Speaker 1>maybe it won't get wall up down with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sledge hammer.</v>

258
00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:05.090
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things I tried to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to point that out.</v>

259
00:16:05.091 --> 00:16:05.691
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

260
00:16:05.691 --> 00:16:07.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something,</v>

261
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:09.590
<v Speaker 1>there's a real thought here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real original thought.</v>

262
00:16:09.591 --> 00:16:11.990
<v Speaker 1>It's something that you have the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>to cause.</v>

263
00:16:11.991 --> 00:16:12.824
<v Speaker 1>It's derived from your own experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your own knowledge and you </v>

264
00:16:15.111 --> 00:16:18.410
<v Speaker 1>formulated it in an original and </v>
<v Speaker 1>compelling way.</v>

265
00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:22.310
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with that is that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get criticized for that,</v>

266
00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.680
<v Speaker 1>you're just going to pull right back </v>
<v Speaker 1>into your shell.</v>

267
00:16:24.681 --> 00:16:25.514
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause that hurts because it's actually </v>

268
00:16:26.901 --> 00:16:27.734
<v Speaker 1>part of you that you've exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a terrifying thing to expose </v>

269
00:16:30.891 --> 00:16:31.910
<v Speaker 1>yourself like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

270
00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:36.950
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an absolute prerequisite to genuine</v>

271
00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:40.550
<v Speaker 1>communication and thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

272
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.033
<v Speaker 1>the ancient Mesopotamians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't got time to tell you this </v>

273
00:16:45.411 --> 00:16:48.950
<v Speaker 1>story if you want to hear it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can come to my maps of meaning class</v>

274
00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:50.023
<v Speaker 1>in your fourth year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the most ancient Mesopotamians had </v>

275
00:16:52.131 --> 00:16:55.350
<v Speaker 1>figured out 5,000 years ago or so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

276
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:56.443
<v Speaker 1>the highest God in the hierarchy of God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so sorta like the highest value or the </v>

277
00:17:00.441 --> 00:17:04.700
<v Speaker 1>thing that should be imitated most </v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully was a god that whose,</v>

278
00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:09.530
<v Speaker 1>whose head had eyes all the way around </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and who spoke magic words.</v>

279
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:13.220
<v Speaker 1>And so the words he spoke could make the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sunrise and make the sunset very,</v>

280
00:17:13.221 --> 00:17:14.054
<v Speaker 1>very powerful speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason the Mesopotamians had </v>

281
00:17:17.751 --> 00:17:18.584
<v Speaker 1>figured this out to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the degree they had was because they </v>

282
00:17:20.451 --> 00:17:22.850
<v Speaker 1>realized that the capacity to pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>

283
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:26.360
<v Speaker 1>which is the eyes of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we really pay attention with her</v>

284
00:17:26.361 --> 00:17:27.194
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the capacity to speak </v>

285
00:17:28.401 --> 00:17:30.560
<v Speaker 1>properties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact the highest virtue.</v>

286
00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.293
<v Speaker 1>And so then you can check yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see all you have to do is </v>

287
00:17:34.581 --> 00:17:35.414
<v Speaker 1>listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you would listen to someone else </v>

288
00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.570
<v Speaker 1>and you have to feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

289
00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:42.650
<v Speaker 1>do I actually believe that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that actually my thought?</v>

290
00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:43.693
<v Speaker 1>And really I'll tell you what you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>find is 95% of what you say has nothing </v>

291
00:17:47.631 --> 00:17:48.464
<v Speaker 1>to do with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's quite shocking to do this </v>

292
00:17:50.191 --> 00:17:52.980
<v Speaker 1>because you'll start to say something </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll think,</v>

293
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:54.413
<v Speaker 1>oh that doesn't feel quite right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't make me feel solid when </v>

294
00:17:57.961 --> 00:17:58.794
<v Speaker 1>I say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about that that I'm </v>

295
00:18:00.481 --> 00:18:03.510
<v Speaker 1>subordinating myself to something or </v>
<v Speaker 1>hiding in some way.</v>

296
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:05.970
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what you're doing,</v>

297
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:10.500
<v Speaker 1>but you'll find out that</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost everything that's</v>

298
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:15.250
<v Speaker 1>abstractly represented right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be that way.</v>

299
00:18:15.251 --> 00:18:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Cause you guys are also young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense,</v>

300
00:18:18.041 --> 00:18:20.950
<v Speaker 1>you know way more than you can actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

301
00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've been taught all these things,</v>

302
00:18:23.081 --> 00:18:26.830
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just in your head.</v>

303
00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:27.993
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have you rather than the other way </v>

304
00:18:29.231 --> 00:18:31.210
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Carl Jung said,</v>

305
00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:34.780
<v Speaker 1>people don't have ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas have people.</v>

306
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:38.620
<v Speaker 1>And that's something to really think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about because then you want to watch and</v>

307
00:18:38.621 --> 00:18:39.454
<v Speaker 1>see what ideas there are floating around</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your head and start to figure out </v>

308
00:18:42.341 --> 00:18:45.820
<v Speaker 1>where they came from because it's highly</v>
<v Speaker 1>probable that they're controlling you.</v>

309
00:18:45.821 --> 00:18:49.990
<v Speaker 1>Just like a Marionette is controlled by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the puppeteer.</v>

310
00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.393
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very similar and there's an </v>

311
00:18:53.561 --> 00:18:54.394
<v Speaker 1>inauthenticity about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that brings us into </v>

312
00:18:56.351 --> 00:18:57.184
<v Speaker 1>existentialism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now I want to talk to you a little </v>

313
00:18:58.481 --> 00:18:59.314
<v Speaker 1>bit about existentialists because </v>
<v Speaker 1>existentialists are very concerned with </v>

314
00:19:02.381 --> 00:19:03.310
<v Speaker 1>authenticity.</v>

315
00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.910
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say that above all </v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

316
00:19:06.911 --> 00:19:10.120
<v Speaker 1>existentialists are concerned with </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

317
00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:11.883
<v Speaker 1>Now of course we know that it's not very</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy to define exactly what constitutes </v>

318
00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:16.864
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would also say there are various </v>

319
00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:22.810
<v Speaker 1>definitions of truth that can be used </v>
<v Speaker 1>for different purposes.</v>

320
00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:25.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause your definitions of truth can also</v>

321
00:19:25.511 --> 00:19:27.970
<v Speaker 1>have a tool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>light function and,</v>

322
00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:28.983
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and finally that we can't come up with </v>

323
00:19:30.491 --> 00:19:35.491
<v Speaker 1>an ultimate definition of truth because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not infinitely informed,</v>

324
00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:36.993
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So ignorance is going to underlie our </v>

325
00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:39.844
<v Speaker 1>claims all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't eradicate the validity </v>

326
00:19:43.901 --> 00:19:47.560
<v Speaker 1>of the concept of truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think one of the ways you can deal</v>

327
00:19:47.561 --> 00:19:48.394
<v Speaker 1>with that existentially is that you may </v>
<v Speaker 1>not be able to determine what's true at </v>

328
00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:52.774
<v Speaker 1>any given moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's quite a different matter to </v>

329
00:19:55.541 --> 00:19:57.970
<v Speaker 1>determine what's false.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot easier.</v>

330
00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.740
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things I often tell my </v>
<v Speaker 1>clients,</v>

331
00:19:59.741 --> 00:20:00.521
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

332
00:20:00.521 --> 00:20:02.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

333
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:04.120
<v Speaker 1>here's the way to clean up your life.</v>

334
00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:11.730
<v Speaker 1>Stop doing the things that you know are </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong that you could stop doing.</v>

335
00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:13.691
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

336
00:20:13.691 --> 00:20:15.900
<v Speaker 1>it's a fairly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fairly limited attempt.</v>

337
00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:16.743
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to say that you know </v>

338
00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:21.430
<v Speaker 1>what the good is or what the truth is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>any ultimate sense.</v>

339
00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:22.563
<v Speaker 1>But we will presume that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you're doing that for one </v>

340
00:20:24.581 --> 00:20:25.600
<v Speaker 1>reason or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

341
00:20:25.601 --> 00:20:26.434
<v Speaker 1>are not in your best interests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about them that you </v>

342
00:20:28.481 --> 00:20:31.540
<v Speaker 1>just know you should stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are kind of self evident to you.</v>

343
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:33.880
<v Speaker 1>Other things you're going to be doubtful</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it about.</v>

344
00:20:33.881 --> 00:20:36.880
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to know which way is up</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which way is down.</v>

345
00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:40.780
<v Speaker 1>But there are things that you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know you shouldn't do.</v>

346
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.033
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of those you won't stop doing for </v>

347
00:20:43.751 --> 00:20:45.430
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have the discipline.</v>

348
00:20:45.431 --> 00:20:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe there's a secondary pay off.</v>

349
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.273
<v Speaker 1>You don't believe it's necessary or it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much of a sacrifice or you're angry </v>

350
00:20:51.071 --> 00:20:53.650
<v Speaker 1>or resentful or or afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

351
00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.513
<v Speaker 1>So forget about those for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's another subset that you </v>

352
00:20:57.791 --> 00:20:59.860
<v Speaker 1>could stop doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be little thing.</v>

353
00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:03.340
<v Speaker 1>Well that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop doing it and see what happens.</v>

354
00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:04.623
<v Speaker 1>And what will happen is your vision will</v>
<v Speaker 1>clear a little bit and then something </v>

355
00:21:08.381 --> 00:21:13.060
<v Speaker 1>else will pop up in your field of </v>
<v Speaker 1>apprehension that you will also know you</v>

356
00:21:13.061 --> 00:21:13.894
<v Speaker 1>should stop doing and that you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop doing because you strengthened </v>

357
00:21:16.451 --> 00:21:17.284
<v Speaker 1>yourself a bit by stopping doing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular stupid thing that you were </v>

358
00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:22.030
<v Speaker 1>doing before that just puts you together</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit more.</v>

359
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:27.390
<v Speaker 1>And you could do that repeatedly for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for an indefinite period of time.</v>

360
00:21:27.761 --> 00:21:29.260
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

361
00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:30.123
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't necessarily mean that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to ever be able to </v>

362
00:21:32.021 --> 00:21:37.021
<v Speaker 1>formulate a clear and final picture of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes the truth and the good.</v>

363
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:38.463
<v Speaker 1>But it does mean that you'll be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>continually move away from what's </v>

364
00:21:41.261 --> 00:21:44.280
<v Speaker 1>untruth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's bad and you know,</v>

365
00:21:44.281 --> 00:21:45.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a bad start.</v>

366
00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:46.961
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soldier,</v>

367
00:21:46.961 --> 00:21:49.630
<v Speaker 1>an incident who will talk a lot about in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next lecture,</v>

368
00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:50.913
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn was a great Russian writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a book called the Gulag </v>

369
00:21:53.651 --> 00:21:54.484
<v Speaker 1>archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was instrumental in bringing down </v>

370
00:21:55.931 --> 00:21:59.380
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union and Solzhenitsyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Viktor Frankl,</v>

371
00:21:59.381 --> 00:22:02.680
<v Speaker 1>who you'll also read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was very much convinced that the reason,</v>

372
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:06.010
<v Speaker 1>the horrors of the Soviet Union and of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

373
00:22:06.011 --> 00:22:09.640
<v Speaker 1>of Nazi Germany and of Mao's China and </v>
<v Speaker 1>various other places around the world,</v>

374
00:22:09.641 --> 00:22:12.850
<v Speaker 1>he was very convinced that the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>those horrors took place,</v>

375
00:22:12.851 --> 00:22:13.684
<v Speaker 1>the death and torture of hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of people was because the </v>

376
00:22:16.811 --> 00:22:17.644
<v Speaker 1>individuals that made up that those </v>
<v Speaker 1>societies were inauthentic in their own </v>

377
00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:22.653
<v Speaker 1>use of of thought and speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it isn't a following orders </v>

378
00:22:27.671 --> 00:22:29.350
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that at all.</v>

379
00:22:29.351 --> 00:22:30.184
<v Speaker 1>It's a bottom up pathology theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the reason the whole state is </v>

380
00:22:33.551 --> 00:22:37.690
<v Speaker 1>pathological is because the individuals </v>
<v Speaker 1>that compose it are pathological,</v>

381
00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:40.780
<v Speaker 1>not because they're good and following </v>
<v Speaker 1>orders.</v>

382
00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:42.863
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

383
00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.980
<v Speaker 1>I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that to be the case.</v>

384
00:22:46.981 --> 00:22:47.814
<v Speaker 1>I do believe that the catastrophes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the state are a consequence of the </v>

385
00:22:53.131 --> 00:22:56.640
<v Speaker 1>amalgamated pathologies of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals,</v>

386
00:22:56.641 --> 00:22:57.474
<v Speaker 1>especially they're willful blindness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so another thing that you might </v>

387
00:23:01.351 --> 00:23:03.840
<v Speaker 1>think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because most young people do think about</v>

388
00:23:03.841 --> 00:23:04.674
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is what is it that you can do in order </v>

389
00:23:07.441 --> 00:23:08.274
<v Speaker 1>to</v>

390
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:11.703
<v Speaker 1>aid the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say like you might if you were </v>

391
00:23:13.211 --> 00:23:15.130
<v Speaker 1>thinking about being an </v>
<v Speaker 1>environmentalist.</v>

392
00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell,</v>

393
00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:20.860
<v Speaker 1>the one sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Route to aiding the world is to clean up</v>

394
00:23:20.861 --> 00:23:24.460
<v Speaker 1>your existential space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

395
00:23:24.461 --> 00:23:26.170
<v Speaker 1>you're not telling anyone else what to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

396
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:30.010
<v Speaker 1>That's a big plus and second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

397
00:23:30.011 --> 00:23:30.844
<v Speaker 1>the more you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you're going to be able to do </v>

398
00:23:33.401 --> 00:23:34.630
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

399
00:23:34.631 --> 00:23:35.680
<v Speaker 1>And so you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

400
00:23:35.681 --> 00:23:36.514
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to clean up the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might start by cleaning up your </v>

401
00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:44.200
<v Speaker 1>phenomenal logical space and see how far</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get with that.</v>

402
00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:47.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a difficult thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you do it,</v>

403
00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:48.063
<v Speaker 1>the better you get at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more capable you are of of handling </v>

404
00:23:51.951 --> 00:23:54.800
<v Speaker 1>larger and larger problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how you should start.</v>

405
00:23:54.801 --> 00:23:59.801
<v Speaker 1>You should start with what's right in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your grasp and with what you can control</v>

406
00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:03.260
<v Speaker 1>and not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll enables you to practice.</v>

407
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:04.220
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's the,</v>

408
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:06.510
<v Speaker 1>here's an offshoot of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an existential offshoot.</v>

409
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:07.423
<v Speaker 1>So here's a hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you imagine the existentialists </v>

410
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:11.533
<v Speaker 1>continually claim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlike the psychoanalysts that people </v>

411
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:16.723
<v Speaker 1>are psychopathological not because say </v>
<v Speaker 1>of childhood trauma or neurosis or </v>

412
00:24:22.101 --> 00:24:23.960
<v Speaker 1>repression or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

413
00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:24.973
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>failure to integrate elements of the Ed </v>

414
00:24:26.811 --> 00:24:27.644
<v Speaker 1>into the ego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They existentialist claim that the </v>

415
00:24:29.781 --> 00:24:30.614
<v Speaker 1>reason that people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopathological is because the </v>

416
00:24:33.111 --> 00:24:33.944
<v Speaker 1>conditions of existence are so tragic </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's inevitable that people become </v>

417
00:24:37.671 --> 00:24:39.590
<v Speaker 1>psychopathological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

418
00:24:39.591 --> 00:24:41.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's the argument?</v>

419
00:24:41.481 --> 00:24:44.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are self conscious,</v>

420
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:46.610
<v Speaker 1>so that's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

421
00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.640
<v Speaker 1>and because we're self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that we're going to die.</v>

422
00:24:49.641 --> 00:24:50.474
<v Speaker 1>We're aware of our temporal limitations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's our real catastrophe because </v>

423
00:24:54.261 --> 00:24:55.094
<v Speaker 1>no other animal has that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like elephants looked like they've got </v>

424
00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:00.350
<v Speaker 1>kind of a dim apprehension of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not articulate.</v>

425
00:25:00.351 --> 00:25:03.170
<v Speaker 1>So they can't really get to the final </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage of,</v>

426
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:04.423
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assessing their existence in </v>

427
00:25:06.261 --> 00:25:08.720
<v Speaker 1>relationship to its,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its finitude.</v>

428
00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:09.823
<v Speaker 1>And of course everyone knows that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're prone to illness of all sorts </v>

429
00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:14.970
<v Speaker 1>and aging and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

430
00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:20.050
<v Speaker 1>so is everyone else they know and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be damaged in comprehensively by</v>

431
00:25:20.871 --> 00:25:23.570
<v Speaker 1>untruth and by false hood and bye bye </v>
<v Speaker 1>betrayal.</v>

432
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:24.560
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

433
00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:29.270
<v Speaker 1>and also that there's 150 things wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you that you're acutely aware of at</v>

434
00:25:29.271 --> 00:25:30.710
<v Speaker 1>almost all times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

435
00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:31.693
<v Speaker 1>you fall short of perfection along </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much any access of comparison </v>

436
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.433
<v Speaker 1>that you wish to generate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the existential point of view on </v>

437
00:25:40.011 --> 00:25:40.844
<v Speaker 1>that is that all of that's enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make the default condition of human </v>

438
00:25:43.671 --> 00:25:46.460
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychopathological.</v>

439
00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:47.743
<v Speaker 1>It's like the weight of existence itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>is sufficient to make normal </v>

440
00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.610
<v Speaker 1>pathological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

441
00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.580
<v Speaker 1>and it's a very powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very powerful argument.</v>

442
00:25:58.581 --> 00:25:59.414
<v Speaker 1>Cause one of the things you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's certainly something I've asked </v>

443
00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:05.270
<v Speaker 1>when I've dealt with people who have ag </v>
<v Speaker 1>or a phobia for example,</v>

444
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:06.770
<v Speaker 1>who are afraid to go out.</v>

445
00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.433
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're afraid to go up because they </v>

446
00:26:08.781 --> 00:26:09.614
<v Speaker 1>might have a heart attack and then that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be too far away from the </v>

447
00:26:11.271 --> 00:26:12.920
<v Speaker 1>hospital and then they'll die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

448
00:26:12.921 --> 00:26:13.754
<v Speaker 1>they make fools of themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's basically the agoraphobic </v>

449
00:26:16.131 --> 00:26:19.280
<v Speaker 1>spheres.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's biological mortality plus social</v>

450
00:26:19.281 --> 00:26:20.240
<v Speaker 1>exposure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

451
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:21.133
<v Speaker 1>It's bad enough to die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you die in public while </v>

452
00:26:23.301 --> 00:26:25.610
<v Speaker 1>everyone's looking at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>

453
00:26:25.611 --> 00:26:27.830
<v Speaker 1>you get the worst of both worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it is,</v>

454
00:26:27.831 --> 00:26:28.664
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not such a mystery that people are </v>

455
00:26:29.811 --> 00:26:33.170
<v Speaker 1>agoraphobic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a mystery that other people aren't,</v>

456
00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:34.591
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

457
00:26:34.591 --> 00:26:39.050
<v Speaker 1>and from the existential point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mystery starts to become the,</v>

458
00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:44.680
<v Speaker 1>the ubiquity of normality given the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intolerable conditions of existence.</v>

459
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a much more powerful viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's correct to,</v>

460
00:26:47.911 --> 00:26:52.911
<v Speaker 1>because there's no reason to assume that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the default condition of mankind is like</v>

461
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:57.030
<v Speaker 1>calm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rational acceptance of fate.</v>

462
00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:58.013
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have to very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very specific conditions that you're in </v>

463
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.570
<v Speaker 1>before you're calm and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

464
00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:03.061
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

465
00:27:03.061 --> 00:27:03.894
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling comfortable and sort of hopeful </v>

466
00:27:05.011 --> 00:27:05.844
<v Speaker 1>about the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's a rare state to </v>

467
00:27:07.081 --> 00:27:09.480
<v Speaker 1>achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can assume that's normal,</v>

468
00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:10.793
<v Speaker 1>at least to some degree in our society </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's unbelievably </v>

469
00:27:12.961 --> 00:27:16.230
<v Speaker 1>technologically sophisticated and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not hungry that often.</v>

470
00:27:16.231 --> 00:27:18.360
<v Speaker 1>We're not cold that often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

471
00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:21.790
<v Speaker 1>or even sick that often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to think of that is the norm.</v>

472
00:27:21.791 --> 00:27:23.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

473
00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:24.630
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely not.</v>

474
00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:28.080
<v Speaker 1>That's it's a miracle that it's ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

475
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:30.833
<v Speaker 1>Now the other claim the existentialists </v>
<v Speaker 1>make fundamentally is something like </v>

476
00:27:33.601 --> 00:27:34.434
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

477
00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.053
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the fundamental conditions of </v>

478
00:27:37.951 --> 00:27:42.300
<v Speaker 1>existence are tragic at at minimum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's worse,</v>

479
00:27:42.301 --> 00:27:43.134
<v Speaker 1>there's evil too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is different than tragedy because </v>

480
00:27:45.301 --> 00:27:47.640
<v Speaker 1>evil is sort of like unnecessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>tragedy,</v>

481
00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:49.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause there's earthquake say,</v>

482
00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:51.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are you going to blame about that?</v>

483
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:52.583
<v Speaker 1>But then there's you going to school and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know there's four people who've got </v>

484
00:27:55.141 --> 00:27:57.630
<v Speaker 1>it out for you and all they do is pound </v>
<v Speaker 1>you flat.</v>

485
00:27:57.631 --> 00:27:58.464
<v Speaker 1>Every time you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you enter the building or make fun of </v>

486
00:28:00.031 --> 00:28:01.920
<v Speaker 1>you and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to torture you to death.</v>

487
00:28:01.921 --> 00:28:04.350
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not tragedy.</v>

488
00:28:04.351 --> 00:28:06.350
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not accident.</v>

489
00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:09.090
<v Speaker 1>It's not your accidental subjugation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fate.</v>

490
00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:09.953
<v Speaker 1>It's some horror show perpetrated on you</v>
<v Speaker 1>by people whose only goal is to make </v>

491
00:28:14.851 --> 00:28:17.640
<v Speaker 1>sure that there's more suffering in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world rather than less.</v>

492
00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:18.653
<v Speaker 1>So you also have to put up with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we'll leave that aside for the time </v>

493
00:28:21.331 --> 00:28:22.164
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're stuck in your pathology because </v>

494
00:28:24.991 --> 00:28:28.830
<v Speaker 1>of the conditions of existence are </v>
<v Speaker 1>intolerable to a self conscious being.</v>

495
00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:30.750
<v Speaker 1>We'll say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you might ask,</v>

496
00:28:30.751 --> 00:28:33.180
<v Speaker 1>well what could you do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

497
00:28:33.181 --> 00:28:34.014
<v Speaker 1>here's one potential answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Answer is see what happens if you </v>

498
00:28:38.821 --> 00:28:42.810
<v Speaker 1>stop doing things you know to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>inadequate and wrong.</v>

499
00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:48.050
<v Speaker 1>So the hypothesis is every time you </v>
<v Speaker 1>engage in an activity like that,</v>

500
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:51.500
<v Speaker 1>you weaken yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put yourself down first,</v>

501
00:28:51.501 --> 00:28:52.334
<v Speaker 1>you remove your own self confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also fail to take the </v>

502
00:28:55.551 --> 00:28:59.210
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to expand your domain of </v>
<v Speaker 1>competence.</v>

503
00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:04.970
<v Speaker 1>What would life be like if you didn't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

504
00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.960
<v Speaker 1>And the existential claim is it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

505
00:29:08.961 --> 00:29:11.120
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a weak claim in some ways.</v>

506
00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:13.940
<v Speaker 1>The claim is bots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's two.</v>

507
00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:17.060
<v Speaker 1>One is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't do that,</v>

508
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:19.820
<v Speaker 1>if you don't try to fix the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could fix,</v>

509
00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:22.520
<v Speaker 1>things will go from bad to worse for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>

510
00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:26.210
<v Speaker 1>And that will spread out and it will </v>
<v Speaker 1>take everyone else's life along with it.</v>

511
00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:28.580
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's on the negative end.</v>

512
00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.830
<v Speaker 1>So you don't do it because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative end.</v>

513
00:29:30.831 --> 00:29:31.664
<v Speaker 1>But then there's a positive claim to </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is maybe if you stopped bullying </v>

514
00:29:35.721 --> 00:29:36.710
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

515
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:39.463
<v Speaker 1>the tragic conditions of existence would</v>
<v Speaker 1>become because you would be strong </v>

516
00:29:42.581 --> 00:29:45.120
<v Speaker 1>enough to tolerate them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

517
00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.353
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's analogous to use idea of </v>

518
00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:53.590
<v Speaker 1>progression towards the self because </v>
<v Speaker 1>young has a very strong,</v>

519
00:29:53.591 --> 00:29:57.850
<v Speaker 1>is existential theme underlying his work</v>
<v Speaker 1>derived mostly from nature.</v>

520
00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:00.790
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the most optimistic.</v>

521
00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:05.820
<v Speaker 1>It's the only optimistic hypothesis I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever seen in psychology.</v>

522
00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:08.463
<v Speaker 1>Truly optimistic hypothesis because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's other hypotheses like the </v>

523
00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:12.813
<v Speaker 1>positive illusions hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is basically life is so tragic </v>

524
00:30:16.421 --> 00:30:19.300
<v Speaker 1>that you have to tell yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

525
00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:23.290
<v Speaker 1>happy false hoods just so you don't go </v>
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>

526
00:30:23.291 --> 00:30:27.310
<v Speaker 1>And that's what normal people do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is an absolutely appalling</v>

527
00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:29.180
<v Speaker 1>philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

528
00:30:29.181 --> 00:30:31.450
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the ultimate and cynicism that,</v>

529
00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:32.770
<v Speaker 1>but still there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

530
00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:33.623
<v Speaker 1>there's a huge literature on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposedly utility of positive </v>

531
00:30:36.071 --> 00:30:36.904
<v Speaker 1>illusions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's also the associated </v>

532
00:30:38.861 --> 00:30:43.861
<v Speaker 1>sort of terror management hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that the purpose of your belief</v>

533
00:30:44.231 --> 00:30:47.980
<v Speaker 1>systems is to protect you from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety of death,</v>

534
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:49.023
<v Speaker 1>which has sort of a variant of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Friday and idea that religion was a </v>

535
00:30:51.881 --> 00:30:52.714
<v Speaker 1>childish delusion designed to protect </v>
<v Speaker 1>people from terror of their own </v>

536
00:30:56.201 --> 00:30:57.034
<v Speaker 1>mortality.</v>

537
00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Very powerful critique of religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's one that I happen to think</v>

538
00:31:01.631 --> 00:31:02.464
<v Speaker 1>is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean one of the problems with Freud's </v>

539
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.820
<v Speaker 1>formulation is that it fails to deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

540
00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:09.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>concepts like the underworld and hell.</v>

541
00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:11.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to just whip up a belief</v>

542
00:31:11.981 --> 00:31:14.830
<v Speaker 1>system to protect yourself against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fear of death,</v>

543
00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:15.933
<v Speaker 1>why in the world would you envision </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like an eternity of suffering </v>

544
00:31:19.511 --> 00:31:21.790
<v Speaker 1>worse than death?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you ever step out of line,</v>

545
00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:24.910
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to understand how that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a defense mechanism.</v>

546
00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cynic would say,</v>

547
00:31:26.471 --> 00:31:27.304
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only reason that say Christians </v>

548
00:31:28.301 --> 00:31:30.460
<v Speaker 1>invented hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they didn't,</v>

549
00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:33.850
<v Speaker 1>it's a very old idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is so that they had somewhere convenient</v>

550
00:31:33.851 --> 00:31:35.440
<v Speaker 1>to put people who didn't agree with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

551
00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:40.390
<v Speaker 1>But you have to be unbelievably cynical </v>
<v Speaker 1>to assume that that's the only reason I,</v>

552
00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:41.253
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any historical </v>
<v Speaker 1>support for the idea that that's the </v>

553
00:31:43.991 --> 00:31:44.824
<v Speaker 1>only reason.</v>

554
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:46.263
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm going to tell you some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you some stories that </v>

555
00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:50.283
<v Speaker 1>some of the most famous existentialists </v>
<v Speaker 1>and history told their their ideas and </v>

556
00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.150
<v Speaker 1>quotations and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

557
00:31:56.290 --> 00:32:00.370
<v Speaker 1>the existentialists that I've read are </v>
<v Speaker 1>often the most powerful of writers.</v>

558
00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:04.690
<v Speaker 1>So Dostoyevsky's an existentialist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn and says an existentialist.</v>

559
00:32:04.691 --> 00:32:08.980
<v Speaker 1>And so as Viktor Frankl who survived the</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration camps and Kierkegaard,</v>

560
00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:12.160
<v Speaker 1>very weird collection of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're,</v>

561
00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:13.213
<v Speaker 1>they're fundamental belief systems were </v>
<v Speaker 1>often very much at odds with one </v>

562
00:32:16.001 --> 00:32:16.834
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are atheists and some of </v>

563
00:32:17.651 --> 00:32:20.890
<v Speaker 1>them are Orthodox Christians especially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

564
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:22.263
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause a lot of the literary </v>

565
00:32:23.381 --> 00:32:26.860
<v Speaker 1>existentialists were Russian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can come at existentialism from a</v>

566
00:32:26.861 --> 00:32:27.694
<v Speaker 1>variety of origin points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what they have in common is what I </v>

567
00:32:30.821 --> 00:32:31.654
<v Speaker 1>kind of outlined is that the first idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the essential preconditions of life </v>

568
00:32:35.261 --> 00:32:39.590
<v Speaker 1>are sufficiently tragic to render the </v>
<v Speaker 1>normative state of humanity,</v>

569
00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:40.573
<v Speaker 1>pathological and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and health something as something and </v>

570
00:32:43.581 --> 00:32:45.980
<v Speaker 1>health and wholeness is something very </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to,</v>

571
00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:49.790
<v Speaker 1>to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspire to or accomplish.</v>

572
00:32:49.791 --> 00:32:54.791
<v Speaker 1>And that and that the road to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>health is the reduction of deceit.</v>

573
00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:56.443
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a thing that's also very </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about the existentialist </v>

574
00:32:58.461 --> 00:32:59.330
<v Speaker 1>cause they make a very</v>

575
00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:04.510
<v Speaker 1>straightforward moral claim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that lies make people sick.</v>

576
00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:05.523
<v Speaker 1>And I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you in my experience as a </v>

577
00:33:07.091 --> 00:33:08.260
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

578
00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:09.453
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you some of the things that </v>

579
00:33:10.391 --> 00:33:11.224
<v Speaker 1>make people sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them have nothing to do with </v>

580
00:33:13.571 --> 00:33:16.970
<v Speaker 1>the psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The things that make people sick,</v>

581
00:33:16.971 --> 00:33:17.804
<v Speaker 1>car while they get unemployed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like unemployment just lays people </v>

582
00:33:21.251 --> 00:33:22.084
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're conscientious and </v>

583
00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:25.960
<v Speaker 1>they just devour themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's so stressful,</v>

584
00:33:25.961 --> 00:33:27.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you're unemployed,</v>

585
00:33:27.101 --> 00:33:31.150
<v Speaker 1>well your finances become shaky almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>right away.</v>

586
00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.073
<v Speaker 1>Plus you don't have any routine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus you're not involved in anything </v>

587
00:33:34.601 --> 00:33:37.060
<v Speaker 1>meaningful in relationship to society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

588
00:33:37.061 --> 00:33:39.730
<v Speaker 1>And then you start to eat yourself up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with doubts and,</v>

589
00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.200
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

590
00:33:41.201 --> 00:33:41.831
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

591
00:33:41.831 --> 00:33:42.664
<v Speaker 1>self criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're a conscientious </v>

592
00:33:44.621 --> 00:33:45.454
<v Speaker 1>person or especially if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious person who's high in </v>

593
00:33:48.041 --> 00:33:50.890
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like unemployment will just flatten</v>

594
00:33:50.891 --> 00:33:55.891
<v Speaker 1>you and then the death or illness of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself or close relative,</v>

595
00:33:56.081 --> 00:33:58.540
<v Speaker 1>that's really hard on people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

596
00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:03.413
<v Speaker 1>there and there were situations at work </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are difficult so people are </v>

597
00:34:05.731 --> 00:34:07.920
<v Speaker 1>bullied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they have a terrible supervisor or</v>

598
00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:08.993
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they're in a pathological social </v>

599
00:34:10.861 --> 00:34:12.340
<v Speaker 1>structure so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

600
00:34:12.430 --> 00:34:13.263
<v Speaker 1>they're basically being bullied and </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressed with every step they take or </v>

601
00:34:16.231 --> 00:34:18.000
<v Speaker 1>they're in a very horrendous </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

602
00:34:18.001 --> 00:34:20.640
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then things start to turn a bit.</v>

603
00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:21.810
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

604
00:34:21.811 --> 00:34:22.644
<v Speaker 1>so you can lose your job and you can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>ill or dying and so can people around </v>

605
00:34:27.121 --> 00:34:29.490
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that'll lay low on a lot of the time</v>

606
00:34:29.491 --> 00:34:30.330
<v Speaker 1>and no wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

607
00:34:30.331 --> 00:34:31.630
<v Speaker 1>It's logical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when,</v>

608
00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:35.370
<v Speaker 1>when people come to me with those sorts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of problems,</v>

609
00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:37.890
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I often notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not psychological.</v>

610
00:34:37.891 --> 00:34:40.290
<v Speaker 1>I tell the people that that's not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological problem.</v>

611
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:43.410
<v Speaker 1>You're unemployed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an actual problem.</v>

612
00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:45.840
<v Speaker 1>And it's really useful to distinguish </v>
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>

613
00:34:45.841 --> 00:34:47.160
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

614
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:48.023
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something that psychiatric </v>

615
00:34:49.831 --> 00:34:51.630
<v Speaker 1>diagnosis does it very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very badly.</v>

616
00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:53.033
<v Speaker 1>If someone comes to me and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed so they're not sleeping </v>

617
00:34:55.981 --> 00:34:57.630
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel terrible in the morning,</v>

618
00:34:57.930 --> 00:34:58.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

619
00:34:58.501 --> 00:35:00.150
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have a lot of energy.</v>

620
00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:03.630
<v Speaker 1>They're having a hard time experiencing </v>
<v Speaker 1>any positive emotion.</v>

621
00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.780
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult for them to move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

622
00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:06.723
<v Speaker 1>and they have a lot of negative thoughts</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the past and the present and the </v>

623
00:35:08.761 --> 00:35:09.594
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do an analysis of their life first to </v>

624
00:35:11.641 --> 00:35:12.091
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

625
00:35:12.091 --> 00:35:13.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a job that's,</v>

626
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:15.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right that,</v>

627
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:17.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that did at least isn't horrifying.</v>

628
00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:18.773
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it okay for you to go to work in the </v>

629
00:35:19.681 --> 00:35:20.514
<v Speaker 1>morning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have an intimate relationship </v>

630
00:35:21.721 --> 00:35:25.350
<v Speaker 1>that's basically functional d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have some friends you know,</v>

631
00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:26.243
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are your relationships with your family </v>

632
00:35:27.571 --> 00:35:28.860
<v Speaker 1>members?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

633
00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:32.010
<v Speaker 1>Are you reasonably healthy apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart from the depression?</v>

634
00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:36.060
<v Speaker 1>And do you have useful and interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>things to do that aren't related to your</v>

635
00:35:36.061 --> 00:35:36.894
<v Speaker 1>career?</v>

636
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:38.003
<v Speaker 1>And if the person says yes to all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those and they're still feeling </v>

637
00:35:39.991 --> 00:35:40.890
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I think,</v>

638
00:35:40.891 --> 00:35:42.690
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this person is depressed.</v>

639
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.750
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they don't have a problem.</v>

640
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:48.870
<v Speaker 1>They're just depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in my experience,</v>

641
00:35:48.871 --> 00:35:52.230
<v Speaker 1>those are the people who respond quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>well to antidepressants.</v>

642
00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:53.483
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause their nervous system isn't </v>

643
00:35:54.331 --> 00:35:55.164
<v Speaker 1>calibrating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an analysis of their situation to </v>

644
00:35:58.321 --> 00:35:59.154
<v Speaker 1>the reality of the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's as if they're lower status </v>

645
00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:03.473
<v Speaker 1>according to their status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comparitor which is a very primordial </v>

646
00:36:05.911 --> 00:36:08.760
<v Speaker 1>thing since even lobsters have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's their status.</v>

647
00:36:08.761 --> 00:36:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Comparitor isn't paying attention to </v>
<v Speaker 1>their actual status.</v>

648
00:36:11.881 --> 00:36:13.770
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

649
00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:15.600
<v Speaker 1>temperamentally high in negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

650
00:36:15.601 --> 00:36:19.260
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe it's because they had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatized earlier in their life.</v>

651
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:22.620
<v Speaker 1>And so they're much more sensitive to </v>
<v Speaker 1>any signs of failure.</v>

652
00:36:22.621 --> 00:36:24.750
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easier to knock them down.</v>

653
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:27.210
<v Speaker 1>But then you have the other people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

654
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:29.303
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have a job and they ha they </v>

655
00:36:31.951 --> 00:36:32.784
<v Speaker 1>never have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe they're 30 or 35 no real </v>

656
00:36:35.881 --> 00:36:38.730
<v Speaker 1>stable employment history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no real educational history.</v>

657
00:36:38.731 --> 00:36:42.030
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty patchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One or more illnesses.</v>

658
00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:46.020
<v Speaker 1>And then family members who are just out</v>
<v Speaker 1>for there,</v>

659
00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:48.283
<v Speaker 1>absolute destruction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like families can be unbelievably </v>

660
00:36:50.601 --> 00:36:51.434
<v Speaker 1>pathological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're in meshed in the familial </v>

661
00:36:53.331 --> 00:36:55.550
<v Speaker 1>situation where for one reason or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

662
00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.610
<v Speaker 1>as soon as they get up off the ground a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>

663
00:36:58.820 --> 00:36:59.653
<v Speaker 1>someone knocks them back down and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe they have a drug or </v>

664
00:37:03.201 --> 00:37:06.620
<v Speaker 1>alcohol problem to go along with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they have a relationship with someone</v>

665
00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:07.663
<v Speaker 1>who has a drug and alcohol problem or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental illness and sometimes you see </v>

666
00:37:10.461 --> 00:37:13.310
<v Speaker 1>people who have like all five of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things going on at the same time.</v>

667
00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:14.563
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

668
00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:17.283
<v Speaker 1>that's not precisely mental illness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now a lot of that's associated with </v>

669
00:37:21.791 --> 00:37:23.500
<v Speaker 1>deceit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

670
00:37:23.501 --> 00:37:24.334
<v Speaker 1>they're entangled in relationships and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in relationships with themselves that </v>

671
00:37:27.191 --> 00:37:31.600
<v Speaker 1>are pathologically untrue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've seen people,</v>

672
00:37:31.601 --> 00:37:32.470
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who</v>

673
00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:36.383
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people who are in families </v>
<v Speaker 1>where probably nothing they were ever </v>

674
00:37:39.691 --> 00:37:44.100
<v Speaker 1>told was true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it was never just true.</v>

675
00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:48.450
<v Speaker 1>It was always twisted and bent in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>way by whoever was talking to them.</v>

676
00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:49.553
<v Speaker 1>For the purposes of that person power or</v>
<v Speaker 1>domination or or positive illusion or </v>

677
00:37:55.231 --> 00:37:56.064
<v Speaker 1>delusion or something like all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication within the family was </v>

678
00:37:58.951 --> 00:38:02.890
<v Speaker 1>motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there,</v>

679
00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:04.013
<v Speaker 1>it's so awful to grow up in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment like that because you can't </v>

680
00:38:06.781 --> 00:38:09.330
<v Speaker 1>get a grip on what's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

681
00:38:09.331 --> 00:38:10.164
<v Speaker 1>it can get worse than that in that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person will tell you that they love you </v>

682
00:38:12.721 --> 00:38:13.554
<v Speaker 1>and they'll act all sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but every time you do anything that's </v>

683
00:38:16.231 --> 00:38:17.064
<v Speaker 1>even vaguely productive and useful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll just criticize you to death and </v>

684
00:38:21.211 --> 00:38:23.190
<v Speaker 1>all the wild telling you that they love </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

685
00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:28.350
<v Speaker 1>It's really horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's all tangled up with deception</v>

686
00:38:28.351 --> 00:38:28.980
<v Speaker 1>and lies.</v>

687
00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:33.150
<v Speaker 1>And it's a weird thing because if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the Freudian hypotheses,</v>

688
00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.313
<v Speaker 1>you'll notice that Freud attributed an </v>
<v Speaker 1>awful lot of psychopathology to </v>

689
00:38:36.791 --> 00:38:37.960
<v Speaker 1>repression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

690
00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.153
<v Speaker 1>But I think the distinction between </v>
<v Speaker 1>repression and self deception or deceit </v>

691
00:38:43.001 --> 00:38:43.834
<v Speaker 1>is very permeable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what's the difference between </v>

692
00:38:48.851 --> 00:38:52.300
<v Speaker 1>repressing something and lying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself about it?</v>

693
00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:53.763
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud would say often that repression </v>

694
00:38:55.031 --> 00:38:57.490
<v Speaker 1>occurs unconsciously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I really wonder about that.</v>

695
00:38:57.491 --> 00:38:58.324
<v Speaker 1>I think that what happens is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>something happened or you did something </v>

696
00:39:01.931 --> 00:39:06.550
<v Speaker 1>that you don't like and it's bothering </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and you could think it through,</v>

697
00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:09.640
<v Speaker 1>but you just decide not to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just don't think it through.</v>

698
00:39:09.641 --> 00:39:12.310
<v Speaker 1>So it's left vague and uncertain and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

699
00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:16.150
<v Speaker 1>fairly emotionally salient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you just refuse to think it through.</v>

700
00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.313
<v Speaker 1>And you practice doing that until you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>built up a habit of not thinking that </v>

701
00:39:22.151 --> 00:39:24.130
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you forget that you've built up</v>

702
00:39:24.131 --> 00:39:24.880
<v Speaker 1>the habit.</v>

703
00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.980
<v Speaker 1>And then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's being repressed unconsciously.</v>

704
00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:28.960
<v Speaker 1>But I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

705
00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.970
<v Speaker 1>or at least you knew when you first did </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

706
00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:34.090
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you meet people who are acting in a</v>

707
00:39:34.091 --> 00:39:36.820
<v Speaker 1>twisted in peculiar way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you ask yourself,</v>

708
00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:39.160
<v Speaker 1>they're very manipulative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say you ask yourself,</v>

709
00:39:39.161 --> 00:39:43.180
<v Speaker 1>well do they know what they're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer to that could be,</v>

710
00:39:43.181 --> 00:39:44.014
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

711
00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:46.000
<v Speaker 1>but another answer could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

712
00:39:46.001 --> 00:39:48.850
<v Speaker 1>but they knew once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they knew,</v>

713
00:39:48.851 --> 00:39:51.460
<v Speaker 1>when they made the decision to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>acting like that,</v>

714
00:39:51.461 --> 00:39:52.294
<v Speaker 1>but after they did it a hundred times or</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and made it into an automatic </v>

715
00:39:55.181 --> 00:39:57.640
<v Speaker 1>routine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then they forgot its origin.</v>

716
00:39:57.641 --> 00:40:00.970
<v Speaker 1>And now it runs autonomously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now they don't know.</v>

717
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:05.050
<v Speaker 1>But they did know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>

718
00:40:05.051 --> 00:40:05.884
<v Speaker 1>this is the sort of point and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the real point of the existentialists </v>

719
00:40:08.441 --> 00:40:09.274
<v Speaker 1>were</v>

720
00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:12.083
<v Speaker 1>clinical psychology and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the claims of morality start to </v>

721
00:40:15.181 --> 00:40:16.014
<v Speaker 1>become very tightly aligned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's something that the psychiatric </v>

722
00:40:19.501 --> 00:40:21.930
<v Speaker 1>and psychological industries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

723
00:40:21.931 --> 00:40:22.764
<v Speaker 1>don't really tackle head on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My experience has been that in these </v>

724
00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:28.200
<v Speaker 1>situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

725
00:40:28.201 --> 00:40:29.034
<v Speaker 1>where the person has five terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>things going on in their life that </v>

726
00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:36.780
<v Speaker 1>there's just deception twisted in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>strewn in,</v>

727
00:40:36.781 --> 00:40:39.750
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are betraying each other.</v>

728
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:41.970
<v Speaker 1>There's no fidelity in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships.</v>

729
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:44.550
<v Speaker 1>There's no clear and genuine </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication.</v>

730
00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:45.653
<v Speaker 1>Everything's manipulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one admits to what they're really up </v>

731
00:40:48.511 --> 00:40:49.291
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

732
00:40:49.291 --> 00:40:51.870
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of false and Saccharin </v>
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>

733
00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:53.850
<v Speaker 1>which has absolutely nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>

734
00:40:53.851 --> 00:40:55.830
<v Speaker 1>It's all for appearance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

735
00:40:55.831 --> 00:40:58.380
<v Speaker 1>and you cannot be healthy in a situation</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

736
00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't think in my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

737
00:41:00.781 --> 00:41:03.860
<v Speaker 1>apart from terrible luck cause you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get cancer,</v>

738
00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:06.120
<v Speaker 1>diabetes or any number of awful things.</v>

739
00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:09.510
<v Speaker 1>In my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart from the tragedies of life,</v>

740
00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:13.590
<v Speaker 1>there is nothing that hurts people more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than deception,</v>

741
00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:19.160
<v Speaker 1>lies do people in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's an existentialist claim.</v>

742
00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:22.930
<v Speaker 1>The claim is first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while life is basically unbearable.</v>

743
00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:25.260
<v Speaker 1>That's an existential claim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's,</v>

744
00:41:25.261 --> 00:41:26.094
<v Speaker 1>there's the hope that with sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 1>caution and attention and clarity of </v>

745
00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.430
<v Speaker 1>thought and speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can match.</v>

746
00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 1>You can it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

747
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:34.933
<v Speaker 1>you can master it to the point where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could even accept the fact that it's </v>

748
00:41:37.551 --> 00:41:39.710
<v Speaker 1>tragic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you multiply,</v>

749
00:41:39.711 --> 00:41:42.500
<v Speaker 1>it's tragedy with the use of deceit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

750
00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:45.710
<v Speaker 1>forget it because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one thing to be hurt,</v>

751
00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you break your leg.</v>

752
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:50.360
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's another thing to be attacked by two</v>

753
00:41:50.361 --> 00:41:51.194
<v Speaker 1>or three people who break your leg and </v>
<v Speaker 1>do everything they can to demean you at </v>

754
00:41:54.201 --> 00:41:57.500
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like lots of people break their leg</v>

755
00:41:57.501 --> 00:41:58.334
<v Speaker 1>and they're not traumatized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very few people who can go through </v>

756
00:42:00.891 --> 00:42:03.860
<v Speaker 1>the ladder experience without being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

757
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:06.290
<v Speaker 1>seriously and permanently damaged.</v>

758
00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:10.433
<v Speaker 1>Here's Pascal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the first existentialists when I </v>

759
00:42:13.381 --> 00:42:14.214
<v Speaker 1>considered the brief span of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>swallowed up in the eternity before and </v>

760
00:42:17.611 --> 00:42:18.444
<v Speaker 1>behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the small space that I feel or even see </v>

761
00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:25.140
<v Speaker 1>engulfed in the infinite immensity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>spaces,</v>

762
00:42:25.141 --> 00:42:27.540
<v Speaker 1>which I know not and which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

763
00:42:27.541 --> 00:42:28.374
<v Speaker 1>not me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am afraid and I wonder to see myself </v>

764
00:42:32.251 --> 00:42:33.084
<v Speaker 1>here rather than there for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason why I should be here </v>

765
00:42:37.081 --> 00:42:40.500
<v Speaker 1>rather than there or now rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

766
00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Now another thing the existentialists do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

767
00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:45.840
<v Speaker 1>that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're Romantics,</v>

768
00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:50.130
<v Speaker 1>they're not enlightenment rationalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason they're romantics</v>

769
00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:53.010
<v Speaker 1>is because they actually don't believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that life is rational.</v>

770
00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.153
<v Speaker 1>And Pascal's comment on on what what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>existentialists often called thrownness </v>

771
00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:03.150
<v Speaker 1>is a description of the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrationality of life.</v>

772
00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:04.013
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

773
00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:06.180
<v Speaker 1>here you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

774
00:43:06.181 --> 00:43:07.770
<v Speaker 1>why you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why here?</v>

775
00:43:07.771 --> 00:43:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Why now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why the way you look,</v>

776
00:43:09.961 --> 00:43:12.930
<v Speaker 1>why with your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you're gender?</v>

777
00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:14.573
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no answer to any of those </v>

778
00:43:15.091 --> 00:43:16.110
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just</v>

779
00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:21.880
<v Speaker 1>how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's blind and random chance.</v>

780
00:43:21.881 --> 00:43:22.714
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even if it's not that there's </v>

781
00:43:24.401 --> 00:43:25.234
<v Speaker 1>something arbitrary about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's something that's arbitrary </v>

782
00:43:28.451 --> 00:43:31.540
<v Speaker 1>and not self evidently just or fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

783
00:43:31.541 --> 00:43:33.580
<v Speaker 1>cause maybe you could've been born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

784
00:43:33.581 --> 00:43:37.210
<v Speaker 1>there are people around the world who </v>
<v Speaker 1>make their living in garbage heaps,</v>

785
00:43:37.211 --> 00:43:38.044
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's whole families and whole </v>

786
00:43:39.071 --> 00:43:42.910
<v Speaker 1>societies that live out in the garbage </v>
<v Speaker 1>dumps and all they do is pick out,</v>

787
00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:44.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

788
00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:48.570
<v Speaker 1>the metal and glass that will enable </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to sort of glean out of living.</v>

789
00:43:48.571 --> 00:43:49.001
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

790
00:43:49.001 --> 00:43:50.740
<v Speaker 1>why the hell aren't you born there </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of,</v>

791
00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:51.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting right here.</v>

792
00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:54.520
<v Speaker 1>So there's an irrational element to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

793
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't justify it.</v>

794
00:43:56.381 --> 00:43:59.530
<v Speaker 1>You can't explain it and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really even know what to do about it.</v>

795
00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:00.573
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

796
00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:05.290
<v Speaker 1>do you owe an existential debt to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who were born much worse off than</v>

797
00:44:05.291 --> 00:44:05.770
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

798
00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:09.070
<v Speaker 1>Or is it just okay that it's that way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

799
00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:11.560
<v Speaker 1>it's a problem that that by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the problem,</v>

800
00:44:11.561 --> 00:44:16.150
<v Speaker 1>the existentialists called thrownness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is you're arbitrarily here in that</v>

801
00:44:16.151 --> 00:44:18.730
<v Speaker 1>form and there's no explanation for it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

802
00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:19.703
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that's outside of human </v>

803
00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:24.910
<v Speaker 1>concepts of say justice and equity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fairness and,</v>

804
00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:25.893
<v Speaker 1>and even sensibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Pascal also points to the fact </v>

805
00:44:29.261 --> 00:44:30.430
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

806
00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:34.080
<v Speaker 1>we're localized things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

807
00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:38.910
<v Speaker 1>you're right there and there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what isn't right there around you.</v>

808
00:44:38.911 --> 00:44:39.744
<v Speaker 1>So you're a small thing against a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinitely large potential span of </v>

809
00:44:46.111 --> 00:44:46.944
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's also an existential </v>

810
00:44:48.721 --> 00:44:51.570
<v Speaker 1>challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the challenge of the finite against</v>

811
00:44:51.571 --> 00:44:52.920
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the infinite.</v>

812
00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:54.713
<v Speaker 1>And that's also an existential problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that it isn't your problem or </v>

813
00:44:59.341 --> 00:45:01.830
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more ad problem.</v>

814
00:45:01.831 --> 00:45:04.200
<v Speaker 1>It's just a problem that springs out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being human.</v>

815
00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:36.410
<v Speaker 1>One of the places where existentialism </v>
<v Speaker 1>and phenomenology touch</v>

816
00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:38.773
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenologists of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the case that reality is best </v>

817
00:45:43.041 --> 00:45:46.070
<v Speaker 1>conceived of as the totality of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

818
00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:50.060
<v Speaker 1>even if that includes things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't normally consider you.</v>

819
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.983
<v Speaker 1>But certainly it includes things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions and motivations and bodily </v>

820
00:45:53.631 --> 00:45:56.360
<v Speaker 1>sensations and all the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't precisely rational.</v>

821
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:58.303
<v Speaker 1>The existentialists would take that </v>
<v Speaker 1>claim and push it a bit farther by </v>

822
00:46:01.461 --> 00:46:02.294
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is analogous to something I </v>

823
00:46:03.601 --> 00:46:04.790
<v Speaker 1>already told you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

824
00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:10.000
<v Speaker 1>the degree to which that </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenological field,</v>

825
00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:14.980
<v Speaker 1>your field of experience is fractured </v>
<v Speaker 1>and incoherent and paradoxical,</v>

826
00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:17.643
<v Speaker 1>that that that occurs in pr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>precise proportion to the week to the </v>

827
00:46:21.671 --> 00:46:26.410
<v Speaker 1>weakening of the spirit within you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily has to be strong in order to</v>

828
00:46:26.411 --> 00:46:29.860
<v Speaker 1>remain on corrupted by the tragic </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions of existence.</v>

829
00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:31.023
<v Speaker 1>So along with the existentialist claim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that life is unbearable and </v>

830
00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:36.093
<v Speaker 1>it's in its very nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tragic and unbearable in its very </v>

831
00:46:38.471 --> 00:46:43.471
<v Speaker 1>nature is the idea that that's made </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse by your own set of inadequacies,</v>

832
00:46:44.441 --> 00:46:45.274
<v Speaker 1>inadequacies that you could repair and </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse that to the degree that you are </v>

833
00:46:49.181 --> 00:46:51.760
<v Speaker 1>rife with inadequacies that you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>repair,</v>

834
00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:52.773
<v Speaker 1>you're going to make the tragic </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation that's integral to life worse </v>

835
00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:59.230
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only for yourself but also for other</v>

836
00:46:59.231 --> 00:47:00.064
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So out of existentialism also </v>

837
00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:05.770
<v Speaker 1>automatically arises a kind of moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity,</v>

838
00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:11.490
<v Speaker 1>which is that you can't just sit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolation and be useless and resentful.</v>

839
00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:14.493
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're useless and resentful and you </v>

840
00:47:16.571 --> 00:47:19.300
<v Speaker 1>refuse to address the things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know you should address,</v>

841
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:22.360
<v Speaker 1>you can't help but pathologize </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything around you,</v>

842
00:47:23.350 --> 00:47:24.183
<v Speaker 1>and so you're stuck with a moral duty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the existentialists would would say </v>

843
00:47:27.851 --> 00:47:28.990
<v Speaker 1>more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would say,</v>

844
00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:35.910
<v Speaker 1>if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder that existential burden,</v>

845
00:47:37.931 --> 00:47:42.520
<v Speaker 1>that existential moral burden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will inevitably suffer for it.</v>

846
00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:46.510
<v Speaker 1>You cannot get out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're stuck with it.</v>

847
00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:48.363
<v Speaker 1>So the existentialists are great </v>
<v Speaker 1>believers in freewill in that you have </v>

848
00:47:51.761 --> 00:47:54.820
<v Speaker 1>choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the wheel has parameters,</v>

849
00:47:54.821 --> 00:47:55.654
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are still things that you can't </v>

850
00:47:56.261 --> 00:47:58.030
<v Speaker 1>get away with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of them is</v>

851
00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:00.473
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fundamentally can't get away with </v>

852
00:48:02.341 --> 00:48:03.174
<v Speaker 1>being immoral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The structure of existence is set up </v>

853
00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:07.713
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you might say if you </v>

854
00:48:09.371 --> 00:48:10.204
<v Speaker 1>were thinking about it existentially is </v>
<v Speaker 1>immoral things are precisely those </v>

855
00:48:13.751 --> 00:48:14.584
<v Speaker 1>things that you can't get away with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why people have identified them </v>

856
00:48:17.741 --> 00:48:18.574
<v Speaker 1>as immoral is that they will inevitably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the consequences of enacting will </v>

857
00:48:22.211 --> 00:48:27.040
<v Speaker 1>inevitably be brought to bear on you or </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the people you love for.</v>

858
00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:29.890
<v Speaker 1>They'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll snap back in some way.</v>

859
00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:30.963
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I see this in psychotherapy very </v>

860
00:48:32.441 --> 00:48:33.274
<v Speaker 1>often too,</v>

861
00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:43.100
<v Speaker 1>people will engage in the same kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior over and over.</v>

862
00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:43.973
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a classic definition of </v>

863
00:48:44.451 --> 00:48:45.284
<v Speaker 1>insanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is insanity is doing the same </v>

864
00:48:47.091 --> 00:48:50.090
<v Speaker 1>thing over and over and expecting a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different outcome each time.</v>

865
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:52.580
<v Speaker 1>And there's an element of self deception</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that.</v>

866
00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:54.890
<v Speaker 1>Like people will</v>

867
00:48:56.370 --> 00:48:57.203
<v Speaker 1>run out a procedure that ends in tragedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they'll repeat that over and </v>

868
00:49:00.091 --> 00:49:00.924
<v Speaker 1>over and you can lay out for them the </v>
<v Speaker 1>causal connection between their actions </v>

869
00:49:04.891 --> 00:49:08.490
<v Speaker 1>and their conceptions and outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'll listen,</v>

870
00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:11.340
<v Speaker 1>but there's no change whatsoever and </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

871
00:49:11.341 --> 00:49:13.890
<v Speaker 1>And so then they run through the routine</v>
<v Speaker 1>again and bang.</v>

872
00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:14.993
<v Speaker 1>And what they're doing is immoral </v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely because whenever they </v>

873
00:49:18.631 --> 00:49:19.464
<v Speaker 1>implemented it produces the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe they claim to want to avoid </v>

874
00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:23.671
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

875
00:49:23.671 --> 00:49:24.504
<v Speaker 1>relativists martyred relativists like to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of virality as something that's </v>

876
00:49:27.001 --> 00:49:29.220
<v Speaker 1>just the arbitrary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's a cultural construction.</v>

877
00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:32.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and society one thinks that a is bad and</v>

878
00:49:32.941 --> 00:49:36.150
<v Speaker 1>society to thinks that B is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you get right down to it,</v>

879
00:49:36.151 --> 00:49:38.400
<v Speaker 1>there's no commonality underneath all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

880
00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:41.400
<v Speaker 1>But the existentialists sort of undercut</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that and they just say,</v>

881
00:49:41.401 --> 00:49:42.234
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

882
00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:48.123
<v Speaker 1>what's immoral?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or those things that you could change </v>

883
00:49:49.901 --> 00:49:53.500
<v Speaker 1>that you do that result in outcomes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are catastrophic for you.</v>

884
00:49:54.310 --> 00:49:57.820
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what immoral is.</v>

885
00:49:58.480 --> 00:49:59.313
<v Speaker 1>And so that's universal because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really matter what the details </v>

886
00:50:01.811 --> 00:50:02.591
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

887
00:50:02.591 --> 00:50:06.610
<v Speaker 1>like what you do that's immoral could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>very much different than what you do.</v>

888
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:08.430
<v Speaker 1>It might be temperamental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

889
00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:11.080
<v Speaker 1>we're each in our own playing field in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

890
00:50:11.350 --> 00:50:13.120
<v Speaker 1>But there's a commonality underneath </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

891
00:50:13.121 --> 00:50:14.860
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well for example,</v>

892
00:50:14.861 --> 00:50:16.750
<v Speaker 1>you won't get away with deceiving </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

893
00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:17.943
<v Speaker 1>You just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason you can't is because you </v>

894
00:50:19.721 --> 00:50:21.940
<v Speaker 1>need a model of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the world.</v>

895
00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:23.970
<v Speaker 1>And if you try to live in a model of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

896
00:50:23.971 --> 00:50:26.710
<v Speaker 1>it isn't like the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll just bump into the world.</v>

897
00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:28.363
<v Speaker 1>And so the the deception brings with it </v>
<v Speaker 1>its own punishment and that's why it's </v>

898
00:50:31.641 --> 00:50:32.474
<v Speaker 1>immoral.</v>

899
00:50:40.690 --> 00:50:44.650
<v Speaker 1>There's other elements of existentialism</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think are extremely interesting.</v>

900
00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:45.543
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the definition of Truth and </v>

901
00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:47.823
<v Speaker 1>existentialism is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is different than the definition of </v>

902
00:50:50.501 --> 00:50:53.530
<v Speaker 1>truth that might be characteristic of </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective materialism.</v>

903
00:50:53.531 --> 00:50:58.531
<v Speaker 1>So truths that are truths from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective of objective materialism are</v>

904
00:50:58.901 --> 00:51:02.350
<v Speaker 1>scientific truths and they're usually </v>
<v Speaker 1>descriptive truths.</v>

905
00:51:02.351 --> 00:51:03.184
<v Speaker 1>And so the truth claims of science go </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like this all undertake a </v>

906
00:51:07.391 --> 00:51:08.224
<v Speaker 1>procedure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'll tell you about and I'll </v>

907
00:51:10.541 --> 00:51:14.590
<v Speaker 1>observe the outcomes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you undertake that procedure</v>

908
00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:17.950
<v Speaker 1>and you observe the outcomes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>outcomes are the same,</v>

909
00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:18.933
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'll do this maybe a hundred times </v>

910
00:51:20.201 --> 00:51:24.850
<v Speaker 1>just to be certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we'll assume that what that outcome</v>

911
00:51:24.851 --> 00:51:25.684
<v Speaker 1>is is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a definition of a procedure </v>

912
00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:29.973
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the experiment that elicits the </v>

913
00:51:31.541 --> 00:51:32.374
<v Speaker 1>outcome and then the demonstration that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the outcome is constant across </v>

914
00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:38.440
<v Speaker 1>observers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a lovely definition of truth.</v>

915
00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:39.273
<v Speaker 1>And it obviously has extreme utility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because it helps you separate </v>

916
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:43.833
<v Speaker 1>subjective fantasy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a form of reality from other </v>

917
00:51:46.871 --> 00:51:47.704
<v Speaker 1>forms of realities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So another form of reality would be </v>

918
00:51:49.661 --> 00:51:50.494
<v Speaker 1>collectively apprehensible reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to confuse those two </v>

919
00:51:53.201 --> 00:51:53.951
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

920
00:51:53.951 --> 00:51:54.784
<v Speaker 1>that's actually a sign of if not not </v>
<v Speaker 1>naivety and a state of undeveloped </v>

921
00:52:02.261 --> 00:52:03.094
<v Speaker 1>differentiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can also be a sign of insanity </v>

922
00:52:04.451 --> 00:52:06.770
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterizes schizophrenia,</v>

923
00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:07.623
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't tell the difference between </v>

924
00:52:08.801 --> 00:52:11.980
<v Speaker 1>what only they experience and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else experiences.</v>

925
00:52:11.981 --> 00:52:16.090
<v Speaker 1>So the scientific definition of truth is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a perfectly reasonable definition,</v>

926
00:52:16.091 --> 00:52:19.180
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the existential definition </v>
<v Speaker 1>of truth.</v>

927
00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:22.900
<v Speaker 1>The existential definition of truth is </v>
<v Speaker 1>more action predicated.</v>

928
00:52:23.350 --> 00:52:26.830
<v Speaker 1>So for the existentialists truth is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of being,</v>

929
00:52:27.490 --> 00:52:31.090
<v Speaker 1>it's not a collection of descriptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's more,</v>

930
00:52:31.091 --> 00:52:33.010
<v Speaker 1>it's more embodied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

931
00:52:33.130 --> 00:52:34.630
<v Speaker 1>from the PSG and point of view.</v>

932
00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:37.390
<v Speaker 1>And so truth is reflected in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in what you act.</v>

933
00:52:37.391 --> 00:52:39.250
<v Speaker 1>So neat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would say for example,</v>

934
00:52:40.550 --> 00:52:44.500
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter what you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it matters what you do.</v>

935
00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:46.660
<v Speaker 1>And if I want to figure out what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe,</v>

936
00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:49.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watch how you act.</v>

937
00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:54.550
<v Speaker 1>And I assume that your true beliefs are </v>
<v Speaker 1>those that are directing your actions.</v>

938
00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:59.230
<v Speaker 1>And so truth is discovered in action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very different claim.</v>

939
00:52:59.350 --> 00:52:59.811
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

940
00:52:59.811 --> 00:53:00.644
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the claim of a passive </v>

941
00:53:01.721 --> 00:53:04.810
<v Speaker 1>observer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the claim of someone who's actively</v>

942
00:53:04.811 --> 00:53:07.570
<v Speaker 1>interacting with the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course we are always acting.</v>

943
00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:11.470
<v Speaker 1>We're always acting interactively with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

944
00:53:11.471 --> 00:53:12.304
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we don't act interactively with the </v>

945
00:53:15.491 --> 00:53:17.410
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we cease to exist.</v>

946
00:53:17.650 --> 00:53:20.200
<v Speaker 1>So we have to do that merely to maintain</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>

947
00:53:20.201 --> 00:53:25.150
<v Speaker 1>And so the existential claim would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>given that in our essential nature,</v>

948
00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:30.680
<v Speaker 1>there are ways that you can act that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your improper Ndu.</v>

949
00:53:33.890 --> 00:53:36.720
<v Speaker 1>Technically it's like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you want a,</v>

950
00:53:37.590 --> 00:53:38.423
<v Speaker 1>and then you act in a bunch of ways that</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes it absolutely impossible that you </v>

951
00:53:41.341 --> 00:53:44.040
<v Speaker 1>will get a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like an existentialist would say,</v>

952
00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:46.740
<v Speaker 1>well there's something wrong with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Schema.</v>

953
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

954
00:53:48.091 --> 00:53:48.924
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not necessarily a moral because </v>

955
00:53:51.331 --> 00:53:53.640
<v Speaker 1>that would only be if you were willfully</v>
<v Speaker 1>blind to it.</v>

956
00:53:53.641 --> 00:53:54.780
<v Speaker 1>But they would certainly say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

957
00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:58.680
<v Speaker 1>it's got this self contradictory element</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes it wrong.</v>

958
00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:00.353
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

959
00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:07.080
<v Speaker 1>so in so far it's like this in so far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're acting,</v>

960
00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:11.520
<v Speaker 1>you're acting towards the name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want something and then in so far as</v>

961
00:54:11.521 --> 00:54:13.830
<v Speaker 1>you want something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you want,</v>

962
00:54:13.831 --> 00:54:18.831
<v Speaker 1>it constitutes the framework within </v>
<v Speaker 1>which you evaluate the utility and truth</v>

963
00:54:19.981 --> 00:54:21.330
<v Speaker 1>of your actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

964
00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:22.313
<v Speaker 1>So it's like you come up with a theory </v>
<v Speaker 1>of truth just because you're doing </v>

965
00:54:24.361 --> 00:54:25.194
<v Speaker 1>something and the theory is a that what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want is acceptable to want and you </v>

966
00:54:28.951 --> 00:54:30.810
<v Speaker 1>know that can be true or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter.</v>

967
00:54:30.811 --> 00:54:31.644
<v Speaker 1>You just assume that and be that</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things that will get you to that </v>

968
00:54:36.711 --> 00:54:40.760
<v Speaker 1>and are appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't get out of that.</v>

969
00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:41.623
<v Speaker 1>If you're doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making a claim about the </v>

970
00:54:43.851 --> 00:54:46.250
<v Speaker 1>structure of the world and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutes appropriate action.</v>

971
00:54:46.251 --> 00:54:49.250
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you make any action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't get out of that.</v>

972
00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:52.913
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

973
00:54:53.110 --> 00:54:53.943
<v Speaker 1>Nisha said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can one live it all truths are bloody </v>

974
00:54:57.251 --> 00:54:58.084
<v Speaker 1>truths to me and then that's an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things I really like </v>

975
00:55:01.571 --> 00:55:03.430
<v Speaker 1>about reading the existentialists too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

976
00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:04.533
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no abstract disembodiment in </v>

977
00:55:07.151 --> 00:55:07.984
<v Speaker 1>their philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that the people who are writing </v>

978
00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:14.500
<v Speaker 1>as existentialists are committed to what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say they want to.</v>

979
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:16.900
<v Speaker 1>They want to enact what they say in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

980
00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:18.303
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's romantic because it does </v>

981
00:55:19.481 --> 00:55:23.470
<v Speaker 1>involve emotions and motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It see with reasoning alone,</v>

982
00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:24.453
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment view of reason was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason and the passions were </v>

983
00:55:27.551 --> 00:55:28.384
<v Speaker 1>antagonistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all the passions could do would be </v>

984
00:55:30.041 --> 00:55:34.330
<v Speaker 1>to cloud reason and that it was reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>job to lift itself up above the body and</v>

985
00:55:34.331 --> 00:55:36.890
<v Speaker 1>the emotions and clarified the nature of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

986
00:55:36.891 --> 00:55:37.724
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the existentialists would deny that </v>

987
00:55:39.101 --> 00:55:40.090
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would say,</v>

988
00:55:40.091 --> 00:55:40.421
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

989
00:55:40.421 --> 00:55:43.300
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that the purpose,</v>

990
00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:47.860
<v Speaker 1>the appropriate mode of being is to act </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>

991
00:55:48.610 --> 00:55:51.190
<v Speaker 1>And rationality can be a guide to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but can also,</v>

992
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:53.860
<v Speaker 1>it can also deceive and all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

993
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:58.360
<v Speaker 1>The passions inform you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't cloud your reasoning,</v>

994
00:55:58.361 --> 00:56:01.390
<v Speaker 1>although of course they can because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to be kind of single minded.</v>

995
00:56:01.391 --> 00:56:03.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can take you off course,</v>

996
00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:08.020
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>enemies of rational clarity per se.</v>

997
00:56:08.350 --> 00:56:09.183
<v Speaker 1>And when the existentialists right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell they put their whole being </v>

998
00:56:13.541 --> 00:56:14.231
<v Speaker 1>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

999
00:56:14.231 --> 00:56:16.120
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gripping and passionate.</v>

1000
00:56:31.810 --> 00:56:32.643
<v Speaker 1>The existentialists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've also identified sort of classes of </v>

1001
00:56:36.491 --> 00:56:41.491
<v Speaker 1>pathology that are unique in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are outside the purview of standard</v>

1002
00:56:42.651 --> 00:56:45.100
<v Speaker 1>psychology and psychiatry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1003
00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:48.203
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1004
00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:49.333
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see often if you're looking at </v>

1005
00:56:50.481 --> 00:56:51.314
<v Speaker 1>debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say between atheists and religious </v>

1006
00:56:52.371 --> 00:56:53.204
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that tends to set the </v>

1007
00:56:54.861 --> 00:56:55.694
<v Speaker 1>atheist back on their heels is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>observation that the religious people </v>

1008
00:56:58.191 --> 00:57:01.220
<v Speaker 1>make that if there's no final meaning to</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

1009
00:57:01.610 --> 00:57:04.700
<v Speaker 1>then there's no meaning to anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that it immediately elicits,</v>

1010
00:57:04.701 --> 00:57:08.750
<v Speaker 1>it's a kind of nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if nothing means anything,</v>

1011
00:57:08.751 --> 00:57:09.584
<v Speaker 1>why do anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a reasonable argument because </v>

1012
00:57:11.481 --> 00:57:14.330
<v Speaker 1>doing things requires effort and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>say to yourself,</v>

1013
00:57:14.331 --> 00:57:16.280
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why should I do x or y?</v>

1014
00:57:16.281 --> 00:57:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Especially if x is difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If who the hell's going to know when the</v>

1015
00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:22.580
<v Speaker 1>thousand years are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the hell is going to know where in a</v>

1016
00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:24.320
<v Speaker 1>hundred years or why does it matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways?</v>

1017
00:57:25.130 --> 00:57:25.963
<v Speaker 1>And then the atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so tie themselves up in knots trying to </v>

1018
00:57:27.831 --> 00:57:30.860
<v Speaker 1>address that issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the existentialists take a different</v>

1019
00:57:30.861 --> 00:57:32.090
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nisha said,</v>

1020
00:57:32.091 --> 00:57:32.924
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1021
00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:36.960
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he viewed the emergence of nihilism as a</v>

1022
00:57:36.961 --> 00:57:37.794
<v Speaker 1>kind of cultural pathology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you remember of course that it </v>

1023
00:57:40.261 --> 00:57:42.720
<v Speaker 1>was Nietzsche who said God is dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1024
00:57:42.721 --> 00:57:47.580
<v Speaker 1>You see that scrolled out in like </v>
<v Speaker 1>washroom graffiti from time to time.</v>

1025
00:57:47.610 --> 00:57:48.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1026
00:57:48.530 --> 00:57:48.961
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1027
00:57:48.961 --> 00:57:51.420
<v Speaker 1>it's like a truism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't what Nisha said.</v>

1028
00:57:51.450 --> 00:57:52.283
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God is dead and we have killed him and </v>

1029
00:57:53.551 --> 00:57:55.920
<v Speaker 1>we'll never find enough water to wash </v>
<v Speaker 1>away the blood,</v>

1030
00:57:56.130 --> 00:57:58.170
<v Speaker 1>which is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very different statement.</v>

1031
00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:01.410
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like he was proclaiming it </v>
<v Speaker 1>triumphantly.</v>

1032
00:58:02.250 --> 00:58:05.250
<v Speaker 1>It was more like a catastrophic loss of </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning,</v>

1033
00:58:05.550 --> 00:58:06.383
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of loss of meaning that the </v>

1034
00:58:07.051 --> 00:58:07.884
<v Speaker 1>terror management theorists would say </v>
<v Speaker 1>would produce like a traumatic </v>

1035
00:58:10.741 --> 00:58:11.574
<v Speaker 1>pathology.</v>

1036
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Now what needs you observed was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1037
00:58:15.401 --> 00:58:16.234
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course you all know this to some </v>

1038
00:58:17.591 --> 00:58:19.840
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in the course of the development of</v>

1039
00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:20.863
<v Speaker 1>scientific knowledge and rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a contradiction between our </v>

1040
00:58:24.281 --> 00:58:25.114
<v Speaker 1>historical moral knowledge formulated </v>
<v Speaker 1>and religious terms and our descriptive </v>

1041
00:58:28.721 --> 00:58:32.050
<v Speaker 1>rational knowledge emerged conflict </v>
<v Speaker 1>between science and religion.</v>

1042
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:33.303
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of that conflict is a losery </v>

1043
00:58:34.421 --> 00:58:35.254
<v Speaker 1>because the purpose of religion is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you how to act and the purpose of </v>

1044
00:58:37.691 --> 00:58:38.524
<v Speaker 1>science is to provide clear descriptions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of of what universally apprehensible </v>

1045
00:58:44.081 --> 00:58:44.914
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not working in precisely the </v>

1046
00:58:46.061 --> 00:58:49.300
<v Speaker 1>same domains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter niches.</v>

1047
00:58:49.330 --> 00:58:51.250
<v Speaker 1>Observation was this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

1048
00:58:51.251 --> 00:58:52.084
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty clear that the scientific </v>

1049
00:58:54.010 --> 00:58:58.480
<v Speaker 1>lists are going to demolish the </v>
<v Speaker 1>substructure of Western religious belief</v>

1050
00:58:58.481 --> 00:58:59.314
<v Speaker 1>and then of course the substructure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of belief all the way around </v>

1051
00:59:01.181 --> 00:59:04.420
<v Speaker 1>the world and there's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences to that.</v>

1052
00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:07.640
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be two consequences,</v>

1053
00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:11.750
<v Speaker 1>and he predicted this say an 1850 it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like 1850 and will to power.</v>

1054
00:59:11.751 --> 00:59:12.584
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that what's going to happen in </v>

1055
00:59:15.561 --> 00:59:16.394
<v Speaker 1>Europe is that there'll be the rise of </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialist slash communist Utopian that </v>

1056
00:59:21.981 --> 00:59:22.814
<v Speaker 1>will possess people and that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce a war and the consequence of </v>

1057
00:59:26.601 --> 00:59:27.434
<v Speaker 1>that war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will be that hundreds of millions </v>

1058
00:59:29.241 --> 00:59:30.074
<v Speaker 1>of people die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he predicted that like 80 years </v>

1059
00:59:34.551 --> 00:59:35.660
<v Speaker 1>before it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1060
00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:36.523
<v Speaker 1>maybe less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think of the Russian revolution </v>

1061
00:59:37.851 --> 00:59:38.684
<v Speaker 1>as a precursor of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which Dostoyevsky would've certainly </v>

1062
00:59:40.401 --> 00:59:41.234
<v Speaker 1>viewed it as a precursor of that now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's totalitarianism on one side </v>

1063
00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:48.120
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the dangers</v>

1064
00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:52.693
<v Speaker 1>and other danger is nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then now nihilism emerges because </v>

1065
00:59:55.101 --> 00:59:59.300
<v Speaker 1>you shatter the meaning structure within</v>
<v Speaker 1>which action is conceptualized.</v>

1066
00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:03.350
<v Speaker 1>And so those are like two emergent </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathologies that threatened people.</v>

1067
01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:04.543
<v Speaker 1>Now if you talk to someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic and rationalist or almost </v>

1068
01:00:07.221 --> 01:00:09.410
<v Speaker 1>always nihilistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're depressed,</v>

1069
01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:13.580
<v Speaker 1>they'll say things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I already told you,</v>

1070
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:18.500
<v Speaker 1>what difference does it make anyways?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Dostoyevsky played out those themes,</v>

1071
01:00:18.501 --> 01:00:20.780
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in in a really very,</v>

1072
01:00:20.781 --> 01:00:22.580
<v Speaker 1>very powerful way and a number of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>books.</v>

1073
01:00:22.581 --> 01:00:24.380
<v Speaker 1>So the possessed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1074
01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:27.290
<v Speaker 1>it's funny cause Dostoyevsky and Nichi </v>
<v Speaker 1>road at the same time,</v>

1075
01:00:27.291 --> 01:00:29.660
<v Speaker 1>and Dostoevsky wrote literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nature Road Philosophy,</v>

1076
01:00:29.661 --> 01:00:33.620
<v Speaker 1>but they were doing exactly the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing in Dostoyevsky's the possessed,</v>

1077
01:00:33.621 --> 01:00:34.454
<v Speaker 1>he talked about description of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian political economic ideological </v>

1078
01:00:39.021 --> 01:00:39.854
<v Speaker 1>scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what he saw happening was that as </v>

1079
01:00:41.451 --> 01:00:44.510
<v Speaker 1>people moved away from there in </v>
<v Speaker 1>measurement,</v>

1080
01:00:44.511 --> 01:00:47.120
<v Speaker 1>in a historically condition meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

1081
01:00:47.121 --> 01:00:47.954
<v Speaker 1>so that was say Judeo Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they started to become susceptible </v>

1082
01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:54.800
<v Speaker 1>to utopian rationalist utopian </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologies.</v>

1083
01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:55.633
<v Speaker 1>It was so out with one belief system in </v>
<v Speaker 1>with another and the other was more </v>

1084
01:01:00.321 --> 01:01:01.154
<v Speaker 1>dangerous because like the religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>system sort of emerged from the bottom </v>

1085
01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:04.994
<v Speaker 1>up and they were weird and mythical and </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to understand from a </v>

1086
01:01:07.581 --> 01:01:08.414
<v Speaker 1>rationalist perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the Utopian schemes were </v>

1087
01:01:10.971 --> 01:01:11.804
<v Speaker 1>rational constructions in theology is </v>
<v Speaker 1>very narrow and they're just imposed on </v>

1088
01:01:15.351 --> 01:01:16.184
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for the example of the communists </v>

1089
01:01:17.331 --> 01:01:21.740
<v Speaker 1>would say from each according to his </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to each according to his need,</v>

1090
01:01:21.830 --> 01:01:24.380
<v Speaker 1>which sounds wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you put it into practice,</v>

1091
01:01:24.381 --> 01:01:27.920
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's instantly genocidal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Nisha said,</v>

1092
01:01:27.921 --> 01:01:29.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as</v>

1093
01:01:30.790 --> 01:01:31.623
<v Speaker 1>the modern world suffers through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>contradiction between scientific </v>

1094
01:01:35.771 --> 01:01:37.330
<v Speaker 1>rationality and</v>

1095
01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:43.990
<v Speaker 1>ritual religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>historically conditioned,</v>

1096
01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:48.760
<v Speaker 1>the consequence of that is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>that two pathologies will emerge.</v>

1097
01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:50.313
<v Speaker 1>One is reliance on totalitarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say to the degree that </v>

1098
01:01:53.651 --> 01:01:54.484
<v Speaker 1>any of you are any logical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you've succumb to the one pole of </v>

1099
01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:01.503
<v Speaker 1>of post religious pathology and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've done is replace adherence to one </v>

1100
01:02:05.771 --> 01:02:06.604
<v Speaker 1>set of beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though religious beliefs are not </v>

1101
01:02:09.401 --> 01:02:10.234
<v Speaker 1>precisely beliefs with another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's rationally constructed and </v>

1102
01:02:12.761 --> 01:02:15.520
<v Speaker 1>incredibly dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

1103
01:02:15.521 --> 01:02:17.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it isn't going to be totalitarianism,</v>

1104
01:02:17.351 --> 01:02:18.184
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing that's so interesting </v>

1105
01:02:21.181 --> 01:02:22.014
<v Speaker 1>about the existentialist does they make </v>
<v Speaker 1>a forthright claim that regardless of </v>

1106
01:02:26.341 --> 01:02:31.341
<v Speaker 1>whether or not the fact that people will</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn to those alternatives is a rational</v>

1107
01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:36.210
<v Speaker 1>can be rationalized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense that it would happen.</v>

1108
01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:38.810
<v Speaker 1>It's still pathological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it,</v>

1109
01:02:38.811 --> 01:02:40.450
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like an a priori statement.</v>

1110
01:02:40.450 --> 01:02:41.283
<v Speaker 1>So I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1111
01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:44.010
<v Speaker 1>let's say you're nihilistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1112
01:02:44.011 --> 01:02:45.030
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lack,</v>

1113
01:02:45.090 --> 01:02:45.923
<v Speaker 1>you have a lot of doubt about life's </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning and purpose and it's like it's </v>

1114
01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:49.771
<v Speaker 1>eating at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1115
01:02:49.771 --> 01:02:51.390
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a disease of the soul.</v>

1116
01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:52.523
<v Speaker 1>And you'll come to me and you tell me 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>logical reasons why what you say has to </v>

1117
01:02:55.801 --> 01:02:56.634
<v Speaker 1>be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say those are excellent </v>

1118
01:02:58.951 --> 01:02:59.784
<v Speaker 1>logical reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're making a very powerful </v>

1119
01:03:01.051 --> 01:03:04.140
<v Speaker 1>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter.</v>

1120
01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:05.483
<v Speaker 1>It's irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that you're nihilistic means </v>

1121
01:03:07.411 --> 01:03:08.244
<v Speaker 1>that you're infected with a pathology </v>
<v Speaker 1>and whether or not you can justify it </v>

1122
01:03:10.861 --> 01:03:11.694
<v Speaker 1>rationally is completely irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All it means is that your rational mind </v>

1123
01:03:15.571 --> 01:03:18.660
<v Speaker 1>is capable of spinning off a sequence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>logical tricks.</v>

1124
01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:22.440
<v Speaker 1>And the ultimate truth is it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>undermining your ability live.</v>

1125
01:03:22.890 --> 01:03:25.170
<v Speaker 1>And so it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it wrong?</v>

1126
01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:28.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't care why it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not relevant.</v>

1127
01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:29.333
<v Speaker 1>Why it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's relevant is you can't live like </v>

1128
01:03:32.191 --> 01:03:33.024
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's an existential claim cause </v>

1129
01:03:34.651 --> 01:03:37.110
<v Speaker 1>the existentialists are interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>different kinds of truth.</v>

1130
01:03:37.290 --> 01:03:38.123
<v Speaker 1>They would say that a truth you cannot </v>
<v Speaker 1>live is not true because their </v>

1131
01:03:44.281 --> 01:03:47.040
<v Speaker 1>definition of truth is different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's predicated on action.</v>

1132
01:03:47.550 --> 01:03:49.920
<v Speaker 1>And then the totalitarianism claim is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing.</v>

1133
01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:52.650
<v Speaker 1>So let's say that you're an ardent right</v>
<v Speaker 1>winger,</v>

1134
01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:53.753
<v Speaker 1>or you're an ardent socialist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you're an ardent feminist or an </v>

1135
01:03:56.281 --> 01:04:01.020
<v Speaker 1>environmentalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or who cares what the ISM is.</v>

1136
01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:06.740
<v Speaker 1>You've abstracted out a bunch of axioms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You develop a coherent representation of</v>

1137
01:04:08.371 --> 01:04:13.371
<v Speaker 1>the world and it's pathological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what the content is.</v>

1138
01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:19.080
<v Speaker 1>It's pathological because it's not you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not you.</v>

1139
01:04:19.081 --> 01:04:19.914
<v Speaker 1>If it was you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then a million other people wouldn't </v>

1140
01:04:21.181 --> 01:04:22.014
<v Speaker 1>believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the existentialists would say if a </v>

1141
01:04:25.201 --> 01:04:28.890
<v Speaker 1>million other people believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely false.</v>

1142
01:04:29.550 --> 01:04:31.470
<v Speaker 1>And they're not talking about scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>claims.</v>

1143
01:04:31.470 --> 01:04:34.140
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a whole different order of,</v>

1144
01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:35.323
<v Speaker 1>of discussion and description.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're clearly making the point that </v>

1145
01:04:39.570 --> 01:04:40.403
<v Speaker 1>you're an individual thing and if you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been unable to particularize your </v>

1146
01:04:47.161 --> 01:04:47.994
<v Speaker 1>experience and you've replaced that with</v>
<v Speaker 1>adherence to some sort of arbitrary and </v>

1147
01:04:52.801 --> 01:04:56.940
<v Speaker 1>universal call to action or </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation,</v>

1148
01:04:57.750 --> 01:05:02.520
<v Speaker 1>you've your pathological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a form of mental illness.</v>

1149
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:05.520
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what's the evidence for that?</v>

1150
01:05:06.030 --> 01:05:06.863
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we'll find out in the next lecture </v>

1151
01:05:09.241 --> 01:05:11.550
<v Speaker 1>is the 20th century was evidence for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1152
01:05:12.330 --> 01:05:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Not so much for the nihilism nihilism </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect.</v>

1153
01:05:14.761 --> 01:05:15.594
<v Speaker 1>I think that we're still in for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I think we swung to </v>

1154
01:05:18.011 --> 01:05:20.890
<v Speaker 1>totalitarianism first and that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

1155
01:05:20.891 --> 01:05:23.590
<v Speaker 1>And so now you see this in postmodernism</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1156
01:05:23.591 --> 01:05:24.424
<v Speaker 1>it's an unbelievably nihilistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy because it claims that all </v>

1157
01:05:28.151 --> 01:05:31.150
<v Speaker 1>meaning for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is reduceable to motivations of power,</v>

1158
01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:35.740
<v Speaker 1>which is like intellect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectually simplistic beyond belief.</v>

1159
01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:40.590
<v Speaker 1>And it comes straight out of like 1950s </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marxism and you know it's,</v>

1160
01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:41.433
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty much permeated the </v>

1161
01:05:43.481 --> 01:05:47.230
<v Speaker 1>humanities and the study of literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>universities all over North America.</v>

1162
01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:48.333
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1163
01:05:48.370 --> 01:05:53.370
<v Speaker 1>it's sick beyond belief to teach young </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that all meaning is relative.</v>

1164
01:05:53.890 --> 01:05:57.870
<v Speaker 1>It's the last thing you guys need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear when you're like 20 it's,</v>

1165
01:05:58.270 --> 01:05:59.103
<v Speaker 1>and the reason that people teach it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there are more afraid that </v>

1166
01:06:02.681 --> 01:06:03.514
<v Speaker 1>things might have meaning then they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid that things might not cause you </v>

1167
01:06:07.091 --> 01:06:08.290
<v Speaker 1>might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1168
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:11.830
<v Speaker 1>here's two options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is it doesn't bloody.</v>

1169
01:06:11.831 --> 01:06:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Won't matter what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the hell cares?</v>

1170
01:06:14.890 --> 01:06:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to know in a thousand years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everything's relative.</v>

1171
01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:19.751
<v Speaker 1>While you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1172
01:06:19.751 --> 01:06:22.600
<v Speaker 1>nothing could be worse than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1173
01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:24.580
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you something that would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse than that.</v>

1174
01:06:24.581 --> 01:06:26.380
<v Speaker 1>It's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take the reverse.</v>

1175
01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:30.430
<v Speaker 1>Everything you do matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1176
01:06:30.431 --> 01:06:32.290
<v Speaker 1>so what's the downside of that?</v>

1177
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:34.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't get to get away with</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

1178
01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Everything you do is important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's linked to everything else.</v>

1179
01:06:39.250 --> 01:06:39.821
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1180
01:06:39.821 --> 01:06:41.890
<v Speaker 1>now choose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got a choice.</v>

1181
01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:44.680
<v Speaker 1>You can either choose to believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic Lee,</v>

1182
01:06:44.681 --> 01:06:46.660
<v Speaker 1>that nothing has any meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1183
01:06:46.661 --> 01:06:47.494
<v Speaker 1>you get to be depressed and anxious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it may be you're impulsive cause that's </v>

1184
01:06:50.141 --> 01:06:50.974
<v Speaker 1>the only kind of pleasure you can find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the advantage is you don't have any </v>

1185
01:06:54.041 --> 01:06:54.874
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do whatever you want and then a </v>

1186
01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:59.440
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalyst would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hm,</v>

1187
01:06:59.470 --> 01:07:03.190
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's why you believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a secondary gain,</v>

1188
01:07:03.191 --> 01:07:04.024
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think you believe it cause you've </v>

1189
01:07:05.291 --> 01:07:06.670
<v Speaker 1>derived it logically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1190
01:07:06.671 --> 01:07:07.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1191
01:07:07.330 --> 01:07:07.930
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1192
01:07:07.930 --> 01:07:08.763
<v Speaker 1>you believe it because it's in the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest of the worst aspects of you to </v>

1193
01:07:12.341 --> 01:07:15.970
<v Speaker 1>believe it because it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it justifies sloths and cynicism.</v>

1194
01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.400
<v Speaker 1>While the opposite is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1195
01:07:18.490 --> 01:07:20.200
<v Speaker 1>what you do matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1196
01:07:20.201 --> 01:07:21.370
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not believe that?</v>

1197
01:07:21.730 --> 01:07:24.580
<v Speaker 1>We'll try believing it's seriously and </v>
<v Speaker 1>see what happens.</v>

1198
01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:26.620
<v Speaker 1>You take the existential claim </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

1199
01:07:26.621 --> 01:07:27.454
<v Speaker 1>One of them is you make a mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially one that you know is a </v>

1200
01:07:30.581 --> 01:07:34.430
<v Speaker 1>mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will absolutely pay for it and worse</v>

1201
01:07:34.431 --> 01:07:37.810
<v Speaker 1>that you'll never get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And worse than that,</v>

1202
01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:43.030
<v Speaker 1>it'll domino out into the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So not only will you pay for it,</v>

1203
01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:45.610
<v Speaker 1>but the people that you're connected </v>
<v Speaker 1>with will pay for it.</v>

1204
01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:48.610
<v Speaker 1>There's always a price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1205
01:07:48.611 --> 01:07:49.444
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you decide which of those two things is </v>

1206
01:07:50.681 --> 01:07:52.360
<v Speaker 1>more terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1207
01:07:52.361 --> 01:07:57.010
<v Speaker 1>when you read Freud and Freud says </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion is a defense against death,</v>

1208
01:07:57.011 --> 01:07:58.840
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1209
01:07:58.841 --> 01:08:02.920
<v Speaker 1>that's a good argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is not by no means clear to me at</v>

1210
01:08:02.921 --> 01:08:04.750
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That the reverse of that,</v>

1211
01:08:04.751 --> 01:08:05.584
<v Speaker 1>which is the idea that things have </v>
<v Speaker 1>intrinsic meaning and that you have a </v>

1212
01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:13.510
<v Speaker 1>unlike an intrinsic responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's by no means clear to me that that's</v>

1213
01:08:13.511 --> 01:08:14.770
<v Speaker 1>a comforting idea.</v>

1214
01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:20.000
<v Speaker 1>It could easily be that the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>comforting ideas that you know,</v>

1215
01:08:20.001 --> 01:08:24.410
<v Speaker 1>you're just a Spec in a collection of </v>
<v Speaker 1>specs and what you do doesn't matter.</v>

1216
01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:28.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can sit and play video games for the</v>

1217
01:08:28.431 --> 01:08:30.350
<v Speaker 1>rest of your life and it isn't gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>make any difference.</v>

1218
01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:33.050
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have any significance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1219
01:08:33.051 --> 01:08:35.390
<v Speaker 1>if the opposite is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1220
01:08:35.391 --> 01:08:37.670
<v Speaker 1>every time you do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological,</v>

1221
01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:39.740
<v Speaker 1>especially if you know it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological,</v>

1222
01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:43.490
<v Speaker 1>you tilt the whole world towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathology.</v>

1223
01:08:44.410 --> 01:08:47.540
<v Speaker 1>And so the existentialists would say of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century,</v>

1224
01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:53.440
<v Speaker 1>we just about an isolated ourselves once</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1962 and then once again in the early</v>

1225
01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:57.230
<v Speaker 1>eighties were this far away from nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 1>annihilation.</v>

1226
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:58.730
<v Speaker 1>You might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1227
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:03.980
<v Speaker 1>why didn't we do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the existential answer would be as a</v>

1228
01:09:03.981 --> 01:09:04.814
<v Speaker 1>collective human beings decided that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be better to continue being than </v>

1229
01:09:08.331 --> 01:09:09.164
<v Speaker 1>not to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way they decided that was by </v>

1230
01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:12.553
<v Speaker 1>shifting the ratio of their pathological</v>
<v Speaker 1>to honest behaviors a little bit more </v>

1231
01:09:16.911 --> 01:09:17.900
<v Speaker 1>towards honesty.</v>

1232
01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:19.753
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might wonder about this sort of </v>

1233
01:09:20.691 --> 01:09:22.880
<v Speaker 1>thing if this kind of thing could </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly be true.</v>

1234
01:09:22.881 --> 01:09:25.860
<v Speaker 1>Well that's why I have you read Frankel </v>
<v Speaker 1>and soldier Nitsa,</v>

1235
01:09:25.861 --> 01:09:26.694
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not classic personality </v>

1236
01:09:27.561 --> 01:09:28.394
<v Speaker 1>theorists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter to me because </v>

1237
01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:30.343
<v Speaker 1>they're getting at something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeper than the terror management </v>

1238
01:09:32.841 --> 01:09:35.120
<v Speaker 1>theorists are the people who deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive illusions.</v>

1239
01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:36.373
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to make a case based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the analysis of an entire bloody </v>

1240
01:09:39.890 --> 01:09:40.723
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the case is society's become </v>

1241
01:09:44.210 --> 01:09:45.043
<v Speaker 1>carnivorous and pathological and precise</v>
<v Speaker 1>proportion to the degree that the </v>

1242
01:09:49.881 --> 01:09:54.710
<v Speaker 1>individuals who make up that society </v>
<v Speaker 1>become deceitful and irresponsible.</v>

1243
01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:55.990
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1244
01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:56.823
<v Speaker 1>And I've never encountered a political </v>
<v Speaker 1>or economic analysis or claim that has </v>

1245
01:10:02.801 --> 01:10:04.480
<v Speaker 1>anywhere near the power of that,</v>

1246
01:10:05.930 --> 01:10:06.763
<v Speaker 1>but it's a terrifying proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though what you get out of it is </v>

1247
01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:12.980
<v Speaker 1>while your life is meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life is meaningful,</v>

1248
01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:17.300
<v Speaker 1>and then if all of a sudden you find </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're suffering unnecessarily.</v>

1249
01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:19.550
<v Speaker 1>This is a weird thing too about meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>claims.</v>

1250
01:10:19.551 --> 01:10:23.060
<v Speaker 1>You know someone's Nihilistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they come and talk to you.</v>

1251
01:10:23.061 --> 01:10:23.631
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1252
01:10:23.631 --> 01:10:25.910
<v Speaker 1>my life has any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no meaning in my life.</v>

1253
01:10:25.911 --> 01:10:26.391
<v Speaker 1>And I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1254
01:10:26.391 --> 01:10:27.800
<v Speaker 1>how do you feel about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>

1255
01:10:27.801 --> 01:10:29.210
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really feeling bad.</v>

1256
01:10:29.211 --> 01:10:29.871
<v Speaker 1>And then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1257
01:10:29.871 --> 01:10:32.930
<v Speaker 1>that's a meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feeling bad,</v>

1258
01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:35.060
<v Speaker 1>being anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurting.</v>

1259
01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:38.960
<v Speaker 1>Those are meanings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just not very good meanings.</v>

1260
01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:42.500
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might also ask yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>if your philosophy</v>

1261
01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:44.613
<v Speaker 3>okay</v>

1262
01:10:44.650 --> 01:10:49.360
<v Speaker 1>throws you in the direction of </v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming negative emotion,</v>

1263
01:10:49.361 --> 01:10:51.970
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a meaning.</v>

1264
01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might note you're not going to argue</v>

1265
01:10:54.281 --> 01:10:55.270
<v Speaker 1>yourself out of that.</v>

1266
01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:56.970
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

1267
01:10:56.970 --> 01:10:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Which shows that there's a meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

1268
01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:01.320
<v Speaker 1>You can't just all of a sudden decide </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not hurting,</v>

1269
01:11:01.321 --> 01:11:03.630
<v Speaker 1>you're not anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have control over that.</v>

1270
01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:04.793
<v Speaker 1>The meaning of your pain is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is completely impenetrable to your </v>

1271
01:11:08.221 --> 01:11:12.060
<v Speaker 1>rational mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even if you're nihilistic,</v>

1272
01:11:12.061 --> 01:11:14.340
<v Speaker 1>you have to admit to the of negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

1273
01:11:15.210 --> 01:11:16.043
<v Speaker 1>Well then what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just denied the existence of </v>

1274
01:11:17.641 --> 01:11:19.420
<v Speaker 1>anything positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1275
01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:22.290
<v Speaker 1>why is that reasonable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's just that,</v>

1276
01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:23.513
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be unlucky and maybe you're </v>

1277
01:11:24.481 --> 01:11:25.314
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1278
01:11:25.530 --> 01:11:26.363
<v Speaker 1>you know when maybe you have reasons to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be suffering that have nothing to do </v>

1279
01:11:28.321 --> 01:11:29.760
<v Speaker 1>with the way you're construing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

1280
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:30.743
<v Speaker 1>because people do get unlucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's always the possibility that </v>

1281
01:11:35.491 --> 01:11:36.324
<v Speaker 1>the reason that things are so terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you was that you're inhabiting a </v>

1282
01:11:38.941 --> 01:11:43.941
<v Speaker 1>pathological perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an existential point of view.</v>

1283
01:11:49.470 --> 01:11:50.790
<v Speaker 1>And somebody tells me what time it is.</v>

1284
01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:54.710
<v Speaker 2>It's one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1285
01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.090
<v Speaker 2>well good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we can stop.</v>

1286
01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:58.740
<v Speaker 1>We'll see you after reading week.</v>
