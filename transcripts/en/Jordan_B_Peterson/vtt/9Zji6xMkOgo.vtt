1
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.390
<v Speaker 1>So today we're going to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud.</v>

2
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.470
<v Speaker 1>Freud is probably perhaps the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>controversial of the psychological</v>

3
00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:17.090
<v Speaker 1>theory risers that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've been discussing in the,</v>

4
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.040
<v Speaker 1>in the first part of this course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is about Freud</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

6
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:26.910
<v Speaker 1>People really like to give him a rough</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

7
00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:30.870
<v Speaker 1>even though it's quite clear that many</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the things we take for granted as</v>

8
00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:34.380
<v Speaker 1>psychologist today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're first introduced into the public</v>

9
00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:38.400
<v Speaker 1>realm of knowledge by Freud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Freud would say that the reason that</v>

10
00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:43.401
<v Speaker 1>people are so upset with his theorizing</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they don't like the implications</v>

11
00:00:44.341 --> 00:00:49.320
<v Speaker 1>of what he says and that he could have</v>
<v Speaker 1>predicted that as a consequence of his</v>

12
00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:52.440
<v Speaker 1>theory because Freud talks about things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people don't really like to talk</v>

13
00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:53.700
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

14
00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:56.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of truth to that.</v>

15
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.640
<v Speaker 1>I also think that Ford was one of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who was</v>

16
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.660
<v Speaker 1>right at some levels of analysis and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>so right.</v>

17
00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:08.030
<v Speaker 1>It others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

18
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.350
<v Speaker 1>but I would say that even where he</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't right,</v>

19
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:11.790
<v Speaker 1>he was helpful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wrong.</v>

20
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.350
<v Speaker 1>And a theory can be helpfully wrong if</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better than the theory that it</v>

21
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:18.270
<v Speaker 1>replaced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like a</v>

22
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.160
<v Speaker 1>hammer is a better tool for chopping</v>
<v Speaker 1>down a tree than a ranch.</v>

23
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.590
<v Speaker 1>It's not as good as an ax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

24
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.310
<v Speaker 1>but if you conceptualize conceptual</v>
<v Speaker 1>schemes as tools,</v>

25
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.340
<v Speaker 1>then you can also understand how a</v>
<v Speaker 1>better tool is an improvement even</v>

26
00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:38.730
<v Speaker 1>though it's not necessarily right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of the clinical theories are</v>

27
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.510
<v Speaker 1>quite tool like given that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>applied to the problems of,</v>

28
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.710
<v Speaker 1>of poor mental health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

29
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.180
<v Speaker 1>and I don't really think of clinical</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology precisely as a science</v>

30
00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:54.420
<v Speaker 1>because it's an applied science and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes it more like a form of</v>

31
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:57.810
<v Speaker 1>engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it can be based on scientific</v>

32
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.060
<v Speaker 1>insight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

33
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.350
<v Speaker 1>and it appropriately is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it straddles,</v>

34
00:02:04.351 --> 00:02:08.040
<v Speaker 1>as we've discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the space between value in science.</v>

35
00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:11.010
<v Speaker 1>And so the theories have to be</v>

36
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.840
<v Speaker 1>hybrid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A strange hybrid.</v>

37
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna play you a little recording</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the only recording that was</v>

38
00:02:17.841 --> 00:02:19.730
<v Speaker 1>ever made of Freud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strangely enough.</v>

39
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean the recording technology was</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

40
00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:23.750
<v Speaker 1>but it's only a minute and 23 seconds</v>
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>

41
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.200
<v Speaker 1>So I'll play that and then we'll do a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly comprehensive job of walking</v>

42
00:02:29.631 --> 00:02:33.470
<v Speaker 1>through Freud's theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then on Tuesday I'm going to show</v>

43
00:02:33.471 --> 00:02:38.471
<v Speaker 1>you some movie clips because it like as</v>
<v Speaker 1>with young,</v>

44
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.480
<v Speaker 1>one of the best ways to understand Freud</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to actually see some examples of what</v>

45
00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:47.220
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now those examples are hard to come by.</v>

46
00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:48.021
<v Speaker 1>It has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out,</v>

47
00:02:48.021 --> 00:02:52.190
<v Speaker 1>but I have a movie that there is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

48
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.550
<v Speaker 1>I should rephrase that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That does a great job of it.</v>

49
00:02:55.551 --> 00:02:56.840
<v Speaker 1>Really a great job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

50
00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.670
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's the recording.</v>

51
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.770
<v Speaker 2>Whew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whew.</v>

52
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 2>Whew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whew,</v>

53
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.740
<v Speaker 2>whew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whew,</v>

54
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.440
<v Speaker 2>whew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whew.</v>

55
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
<v Speaker 2>Mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

56
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to give you some historical</v>

57
00:05:00.531 --> 00:05:03.680
<v Speaker 1>background so that you can understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>the context within which Freud was</v>

58
00:05:03.681 --> 00:05:05.780
<v Speaker 1>operating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the reason I'm going to do this</v>

59
00:05:05.781 --> 00:05:06.800
<v Speaker 1>because you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

60
00:05:06.801 --> 00:05:10.310
<v Speaker 1>why is the history necessary?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason it's necessary is</v>

61
00:05:10.311 --> 00:05:15.311
<v Speaker 1>because</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental disorders such as they are,</v>

62
00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.810
<v Speaker 1>have a sociological element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you might,</v>

63
00:05:23.211 --> 00:05:28.211
<v Speaker 1>you might think about it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human brain is obviously predisposed</v>

64
00:05:29.421 --> 00:05:33.620
<v Speaker 1>to learn languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a biological substrate for</v>

65
00:05:33.621 --> 00:05:35.840
<v Speaker 1>language learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't really understand it.</v>

66
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.990
<v Speaker 1>You can think of it as a capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although that doesn't help.</v>

67
00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.660
<v Speaker 1>But when you launch a baby into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and the baby encounters a</v>

68
00:05:44.661 --> 00:05:47.840
<v Speaker 1>linguistic community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he or she learns to speak very,</v>

69
00:05:47.841 --> 00:05:50.360
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the languages are different</v>

70
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.810
<v Speaker 1>depending on the culture and mental</v>
<v Speaker 1>illnesses are like that.</v>

71
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.640
<v Speaker 1>So you can think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well</v>

72
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.270
<v Speaker 1>there can be biological disruption at</v>
<v Speaker 1>one level of analysis.</v>

73
00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.090
<v Speaker 1>Sorry about that guys.</v>

74
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.390
<v Speaker 1>There can be biological disruption at</v>
<v Speaker 1>one level of analysis and maybe that</v>

75
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:19.220
<v Speaker 1>biological disruption in some sense is</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat constant across cultures,</v>

76
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.460
<v Speaker 1>but then the manner in which the</v>
<v Speaker 1>disturbance manifests itself,</v>

77
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.370
<v Speaker 1>the specific manner is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>shaped by the culture.</v>

78
00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:28.760
<v Speaker 1>And then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a Friday and idea because</v>

79
00:06:28.761 --> 00:06:32.450
<v Speaker 1>culture battles against the individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>to some degree and so that's sort of the</v>

80
00:06:32.451 --> 00:06:37.451
<v Speaker 1>idea of the Super Ego against the ID.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the battle between the individual</v>

81
00:06:38.421 --> 00:06:42.800
<v Speaker 1>and culture is going to take forms that</v>
<v Speaker 1>differ with the culture because</v>

82
00:06:42.801 --> 00:06:47.801
<v Speaker 1>sometimes in some parks there's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be trouble in this society with regards</v>

83
00:06:49.371 --> 00:06:53.390
<v Speaker 1>to incorporating one set of drives and</v>
<v Speaker 1>other times there's going to be trouble</v>

84
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.170
<v Speaker 1>incorporating another set of drives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for Freud</v>

85
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:04.060
<v Speaker 1>in Freud's time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality was very heavily,</v>

86
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.070
<v Speaker 1>it was very problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's exactly appropriate</v>

87
00:07:09.071 --> 00:07:11.700
<v Speaker 1>to say that it was repressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that more,</v>

88
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.320
<v Speaker 1>more that it was extraordinarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>problematic.</v>

89
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.370
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that sex is</v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily problematic for all</v>

90
00:07:18.371 --> 00:07:21.220
<v Speaker 1>sorts of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the main reasons is part from</v>

91
00:07:21.221 --> 00:07:24.500
<v Speaker 1>pregnancy apart from unwanted pregnancy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

92
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.850
<v Speaker 1>apart from the passions that sexual</v>
<v Speaker 1>attraction in flames,</v>

93
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.720
<v Speaker 1>it's also an incredibly effective vector</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the transmission of disease.</v>

94
00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:37.150
<v Speaker 1>And so part of the reason that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have mixed motives and with regards to</v>

95
00:07:37.151 --> 00:07:39.160
<v Speaker 1>their sexual behavior is because</v>

96
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:46.600
<v Speaker 1>like eating sex is one of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>activities that can also potentially be</v>

97
00:07:46.601 --> 00:07:49.660
<v Speaker 1>contaminating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that happened in</v>

98
00:07:49.661 --> 00:07:54.100
<v Speaker 1>the Victorian era was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the,</v>

99
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.080
<v Speaker 1>when the Europeans came to North</v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

100
00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.980
<v Speaker 1>they carried a variety of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>illnesses,</v>

101
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.240
<v Speaker 1>measles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mumps,</v>

102
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.130
<v Speaker 1>small smallpox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those were very,</v>

103
00:08:03.131 --> 00:08:07.000
<v Speaker 1>very hard on the native American</v>
<v Speaker 1>population and wipe about 95% of it out</v>

104
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:13.770
<v Speaker 1>there is a theory that syphilis was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reverse gift and then it was brought to</v>

105
00:08:14.021 --> 00:08:18.850
<v Speaker 1>the old world by the new world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the only illness as far as anyone</v>

106
00:08:18.851 --> 00:08:21.130
<v Speaker 1>knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that had that particular characteristic.</v>

107
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.230
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a devastating illness.</v>

108
00:08:23.231 --> 00:08:25.150
<v Speaker 1>Syphilis mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

109
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:30.160
<v Speaker 1>it was certainly the syphilis problem in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe in the late 19 hundreds with</v>

110
00:08:30.161 --> 00:08:34.240
<v Speaker 1>certainly as serious as they age crisis</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 20th century,</v>

111
00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.240
<v Speaker 1>which is still to some degree running</v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

112
00:08:37.241 --> 00:08:40.390
<v Speaker 1>especially in developing countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is,</v>

113
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.930
<v Speaker 1>has been somewhat controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

114
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.130
<v Speaker 1>we're also very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rigid gender roles.</v>

115
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:52.840
<v Speaker 1>And that was pretty true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say around the world until</v>

116
00:08:55.230 --> 00:09:00.230
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century and probably really</v>
<v Speaker 1>until the 1950s or thereabouts when,</v>

117
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:06.270
<v Speaker 1>because it was at the end of the fifties</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the birth control pill was invented</v>

118
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:12.080
<v Speaker 1>and the birth control pill was what</v>
<v Speaker 1>propelled the political movements that</v>

119
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:18.410
<v Speaker 1>facilitated the movement of women into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the workplace and on mass by the 1970s.</v>

120
00:09:19.741 --> 00:09:21.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean people like to attribute that to</v>
<v Speaker 1>political,</v>

121
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.560
<v Speaker 1>to political pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but without the biological</v>

122
00:09:25.561 --> 00:09:27.480
<v Speaker 1>transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that political pressure would have been</v>

123
00:09:27.481 --> 00:09:29.070
<v Speaker 1>pointless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

124
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:34.350
<v Speaker 1>so I think it's hard for modern people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand how problematic sex was</v>

125
00:09:34.351 --> 00:09:36.400
<v Speaker 1>for the victorians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

126
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:42.590
<v Speaker 1>there's a conflict between propagation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the species and the happiness and</v>

127
00:09:43.351 --> 00:09:45.990
<v Speaker 1>health of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a particular individual.</v>

128
00:09:45.991 --> 00:09:49.680
<v Speaker 1>And it's a difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem to solve,</v>

129
00:09:49.681 --> 00:09:52.080
<v Speaker 1>especially because children are</v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent for so long.</v>

130
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:58.140
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is from on [inaudible] who wrote a</v>

131
00:09:58.141 --> 00:09:59.610
<v Speaker 1>great book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're really interested in</v>

132
00:09:59.611 --> 00:10:02.310
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the best book you can read as an</v>

133
00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:02.820
<v Speaker 1>introduction.</v>

134
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.920
<v Speaker 1>That's called the discovery of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>

135
00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:08.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of what I'm going to tell you</v>

136
00:10:08.761 --> 00:10:11.700
<v Speaker 1>about Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I've read a fair bit of Freud,</v>

137
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.690
<v Speaker 1>I took from the discovery of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious because it's re it's</v>

138
00:10:15.691 --> 00:10:19.650
<v Speaker 1>regarded as the best scholarly work that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was ever done on the history of the</v>

139
00:10:19.651 --> 00:10:23.940
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic movement and also on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud and young and Adler.</v>

140
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:26.760
<v Speaker 1>And so Alan Jay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is an existential psychotherapist</v>

141
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:30.390
<v Speaker 1>who lived in Montreal at least when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was older</v>

142
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:37.040
<v Speaker 1>at produced a very even handed</v>
<v Speaker 1>historical representation of the</v>

143
00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:42.150
<v Speaker 1>precursors to the idea of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious and then a Freud's theories</v>

144
00:10:42.151 --> 00:10:43.800
<v Speaker 1>and young's theories and Adler's</v>
<v Speaker 1>theories.</v>

145
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:46.950
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's what the world was like.</v>

146
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:52.200
<v Speaker 1>It was a world shaped by man for man in</v>
<v Speaker 1>which women occupied the second place.</v>

147
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:54.210
<v Speaker 1>Political Rights for women did not</v>
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>

148
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.410
<v Speaker 1>The separation and dissimilarity of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexist was sharper than today.</v>

149
00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Women who wore slacks or wore their hair</v>
<v Speaker 1>shorter smoked were hardly to be found.</v>

150
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:08.060
<v Speaker 1>The university's admitted no female</v>
<v Speaker 1>students until the early 1890s man's</v>

151
00:11:08.161 --> 00:11:11.850
<v Speaker 1>authority over his children and also</v>
<v Speaker 1>over his wife was unquestioned.</v>

152
00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Education was authoritarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The despotic father was a common figure</v>

153
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.790
<v Speaker 1>and was particularly conspicuous only</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he became extremely cruel.</v>

154
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.730
<v Speaker 1>Laws were more repressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>delinquent youth,</v>

155
00:11:23.731 --> 00:11:27.660
<v Speaker 1>sternly punished and corporal punishment</v>
<v Speaker 1>was considered indispensable.</v>

156
00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:31.680
<v Speaker 1>Sexual repression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposedly characteristic of the</v>

157
00:11:31.681 --> 00:11:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Victorian psyche was often merely the</v>
<v Speaker 1>expression of two facts,</v>

158
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:39.090
<v Speaker 1>the lack of diffusion of contraceptives</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the fear of venereal disease.</v>

159
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:43.110
<v Speaker 1>Now there's another issue as well</v>
<v Speaker 1>because because employment</v>

160
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.420
<v Speaker 1>opportunities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are extraordinarily limited for women</v>

161
00:11:45.421 --> 00:11:48.150
<v Speaker 1>for a variety of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was also very,</v>

162
00:11:48.151 --> 00:11:52.350
<v Speaker 1>very problematic if a woman became</v>
<v Speaker 1>pregnant outside of wedlock.</v>

163
00:11:52.351 --> 00:11:57.351
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing really necessary to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand is that people in the late 18</v>

164
00:11:57.551 --> 00:11:59.800
<v Speaker 1>hundreds didn't have very much money.</v>

165
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.950
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in the civilized world,</v>

166
00:12:02.951 --> 00:12:05.920
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the late 18 hundreds,</v>

167
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:11.160
<v Speaker 1>the average amount of money in today's</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms that people lived on was about a</v>

168
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.980
<v Speaker 1>dollar a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost impossible for us to</v>

169
00:12:14.981 --> 00:12:18.130
<v Speaker 1>imagine how much wealthier we are now</v>
<v Speaker 1>than then.</v>

170
00:12:18.131 --> 00:12:22.060
<v Speaker 1>People were only 120 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

171
00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.750
<v Speaker 1>so there were three factors that made</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality difficult to integrate.</v>

172
00:12:25.751 --> 00:12:28.570
<v Speaker 1>One was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sheer danger of pregnancy for women.</v>

173
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then disease.</v>

174
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:33.250
<v Speaker 1>And then the fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

175
00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.250
<v Speaker 1>the fact associated with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're no contraceptives,</v>

176
00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:39.460
<v Speaker 1>venereal disease was all the more</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous because of the great spread of</v>

177
00:12:39.461 --> 00:12:43.510
<v Speaker 1>prostitution and because prostitutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>were almost invariably contaminated and</v>

178
00:12:43.511 --> 00:12:45.550
<v Speaker 1>therefore potential sources of</v>
<v Speaker 1>infection.</v>

179
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.000
<v Speaker 1>We can hardly imagine today how</v>
<v Speaker 1>monstrous syphilis appeared to people of</v>

180
00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:53.110
<v Speaker 1>that time made worse by the fact that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was likely to be transmitted to the next</v>

181
00:12:53.111 --> 00:12:56.470
<v Speaker 1>generation in the form of hereditary</v>
<v Speaker 1>syphilis,</v>

182
00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:58.480
<v Speaker 1>which in turn had become a nightmarish</v>
<v Speaker 1>myth.</v>

183
00:12:58.481 --> 00:13:02.470
<v Speaker 1>And to which many physicians attributed</v>
<v Speaker 1>all diseases of unknown origin while in</v>

184
00:13:02.471 --> 00:13:07.471
<v Speaker 1>syphilis was was andy is a particularly</v>
<v Speaker 1>problematic pathogen because it produces</v>

185
00:13:08.051 --> 00:13:13.051
<v Speaker 1>a massive range of symptoms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's no telling what form it</v>

186
00:13:13.241 --> 00:13:15.940
<v Speaker 1>will necessarily take in one victim</v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to another.</v>

187
00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:21.390
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>the victorians had no shortage of</v>

188
00:13:21.761 --> 00:13:25.150
<v Speaker 1>reasons to be in serious conflict about</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality.</v>

189
00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:31.420
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud was also very much influenced by</v>

190
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:35.000
<v Speaker 1>niches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ellenberger g says that psychoanalysis</v>

191
00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.680
<v Speaker 1>belongs to that unmasking trend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The search for hidden unconscious</v>

192
00:13:38.681 --> 00:13:42.670
<v Speaker 1>motivations characteristic of the 1880</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 1890s in freud as a</v>

193
00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:46.510
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche words and deeds are viewed as</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestations of unconscious</v>

194
00:13:46.511 --> 00:13:49.300
<v Speaker 1>motivations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainly of instincts and conflicts have</v>

195
00:13:49.301 --> 00:13:52.840
<v Speaker 1>instincts for both men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The unconscious is the realm of the</v>

196
00:13:52.841 --> 00:13:55.000
<v Speaker 1>wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brutish instincts that cannot find</v>

197
00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:57.700
<v Speaker 1>permissible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Outlets derive from earlier stages of</v>

198
00:13:57.701 --> 00:14:01.120
<v Speaker 1>the individual and of mankind and find</v>
<v Speaker 1>expression in passion,</v>

199
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.010
<v Speaker 1>dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and mental illness.</v>

200
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:03.911
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

201
00:14:03.911 --> 00:14:05.250
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

202
00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:09.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it also seems to you that these are</v>

203
00:14:09.221 --> 00:14:14.221
<v Speaker 1>sorts of things that we take for granted</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that people don't always say what</v>

204
00:14:14.861 --> 00:14:18.550
<v Speaker 1>they mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that their speech and their actions are</v>

205
00:14:18.551 --> 00:14:21.640
<v Speaker 1>unfleet influenced by factors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're not necessarily conscious</v>

206
00:14:21.641 --> 00:14:25.360
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That some of the drives or the</v>

207
00:14:25.361 --> 00:14:30.361
<v Speaker 1>motivational states that people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of people influenced the</v>

208
00:14:31.091 --> 00:14:34.480
<v Speaker 1>manner in which they speak influenced</v>
<v Speaker 1>their dreams and influence their actions</v>

209
00:14:34.481 --> 00:14:36.250
<v Speaker 1>in ways that are difficult to discover.</v>

210
00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:42.070
<v Speaker 1>And that passions and dreams and mental</v>
<v Speaker 1>illnesses are manifestations of the</v>

211
00:14:42.071 --> 00:14:45.550
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you see what happens to a thinker</v>

212
00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:49.210
<v Speaker 1>whose ideas are rapidly integrated into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the culture.</v>

213
00:14:49.211 --> 00:14:52.490
<v Speaker 1>And that was the case with Freud despite</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that he said there was great</v>

214
00:14:52.491 --> 00:14:55.910
<v Speaker 1>resistance and there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean the idea is that he put</v>

215
00:14:55.911 --> 00:14:58.220
<v Speaker 1>forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're integrated into into Western</v>

216
00:14:58.221 --> 00:15:01.980
<v Speaker 1>culture during his lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a staggeringly fast from</v>

217
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.510
<v Speaker 1>historical perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you absorb a great thinkers,</v>

218
00:15:05.511 --> 00:15:09.060
<v Speaker 1>ideas and those become axioms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they're,</v>

219
00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:11.720
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're what people assume then all</v>

220
00:15:11.721 --> 00:15:14.900
<v Speaker 1>that's really left of what their thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think is what's the error,</v>

221
00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause the errors of course don't become</v>

222
00:15:17.061 --> 00:15:19.790
<v Speaker 1>incorporated and then the thinker just</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets blamed for his errors.</v>

223
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:22.370
<v Speaker 1>So and that's certainly something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to Freud.</v>

224
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:28.010
<v Speaker 1>Even the term id which actually means it</v>
<v Speaker 1>originates from niches,</v>

225
00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.700
<v Speaker 1>the dynamic concept of mind with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>notions of mental energy,</v>

226
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:36.440
<v Speaker 1>Quanta of latent or inhibited energy or</v>
<v Speaker 1>release of energy or transfer from one</v>

227
00:15:36.441 --> 00:15:40.750
<v Speaker 1>drive to another is also to be founded</v>
<v Speaker 1>in each year before Freud nature</v>

228
00:15:40.751 --> 00:15:44.810
<v Speaker 1>conceived the mind as a system of drives</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can collide or be fused into one</v>

229
00:15:44.811 --> 00:15:45.644
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

230
00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:47.160
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

231
00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.920
<v Speaker 1>In contrast to Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however neat,</v>

232
00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.500
<v Speaker 1>did not give prevalence to the sexual</v>
<v Speaker 1>drive whose importance he duly</v>

233
00:15:52.501 --> 00:15:54.990
<v Speaker 1>acknowledged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but too aggressive and self destructive</v>

234
00:15:54.991 --> 00:15:58.470
<v Speaker 1>drives need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She also understood those processes that</v>

235
00:15:58.471 --> 00:16:00.360
<v Speaker 1>the Freud Ian's called defense</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms,</v>

236
00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:05.570
<v Speaker 1>particularly sublimation to sublimate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something is to take a form of energy</v>

237
00:16:05.971 --> 00:16:07.650
<v Speaker 1>like sexual energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

238
00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:08.850
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

239
00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:13.610
<v Speaker 1>and pour it into something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the sublimation ideas,</v>

240
00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:16.590
<v Speaker 1>very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One because for Freud it was more of an</v>

241
00:16:16.591 --> 00:16:19.150
<v Speaker 1>individual issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if,</v>

242
00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:20.010
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

243
00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:23.370
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once he thought of Sexual Energy Libido</v>

244
00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.920
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a kind of in some sense of free</v>

245
00:16:25.921 --> 00:16:28.860
<v Speaker 1>energy was a source of energy that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche could use.</v>

246
00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.830
<v Speaker 1>And because it was in some sense of free</v>
<v Speaker 1>source of energy,</v>

247
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:34.890
<v Speaker 1>it could be channeled into other</v>
<v Speaker 1>activities.</v>

248
00:16:34.891 --> 00:16:36.150
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

249
00:16:36.151 --> 00:16:40.620
<v Speaker 1>one of the obvious examples of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be paintings of nudes for example,</v>

250
00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:44.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or into creativity in general.</v>

251
00:16:44.491 --> 00:16:46.740
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Freud actually believed that the</v>

252
00:16:46.741 --> 00:16:50.580
<v Speaker 1>reason that people became civilized was</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we learned how to sublimate our</v>

253
00:16:50.581 --> 00:16:53.160
<v Speaker 1>instinctual energies into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

254
00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:58.020
<v Speaker 1>forms of activity and thought that were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were acceptable in the social</v>

255
00:16:58.021 --> 00:16:59.370
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

256
00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:02.700
<v Speaker 1>the funny thing about the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sublimation is that I think it actually</v>

257
00:17:02.701 --> 00:17:05.170
<v Speaker 1>works better as a phylogenetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

258
00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.430
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis then as an entouch genetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis.</v>

259
00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:09.270
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here,</v>

260
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:10.110
<v Speaker 1>here's why.</v>

261
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:11.943
<v Speaker 3>MMM.</v>

262
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:17.200
<v Speaker 1>It is certainly the case that one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons that people are creative,</v>

263
00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:22.440
<v Speaker 1>especially one of the reasons that men</v>
<v Speaker 1>are creative is because if a man is</v>

264
00:17:23.021 --> 00:17:26.170
<v Speaker 1>successfully creative and that makes him</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful,</v>

265
00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:29.950
<v Speaker 1>the probability that he's going to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wider choice of mates,</v>

266
00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:34.900
<v Speaker 1>or at least the possibility of what he</v>
<v Speaker 1>might consider a higher quality mate</v>

267
00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.980
<v Speaker 1>goes up immensely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because women,</v>

268
00:17:38.981 --> 00:17:41.830
<v Speaker 1>unlike their closest biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>relatives,</v>

269
00:17:41.831 --> 00:17:46.780
<v Speaker 1>which are the chimpanzees are extremely</v>
<v Speaker 1>selective maters and women tend to mate</v>

270
00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:50.110
<v Speaker 1>across and up dominance hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

271
00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.680
<v Speaker 1>and this looks like a biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>propensity.</v>

272
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.870
<v Speaker 1>It's the case for women all around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

273
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:58.860
<v Speaker 1>It's also as far as we can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the source of the rapid expansion of</v>

274
00:17:58.861 --> 00:18:01.920
<v Speaker 1>human creative ability and intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

275
00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:06.120
<v Speaker 1>it's true just as much in egalitarian</v>
<v Speaker 1>societies as it is in societies that are</v>

276
00:18:06.121 --> 00:18:08.280
<v Speaker 1>extremely unequal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

277
00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:15.620
<v Speaker 1>and it's also one of the major causes</v>
<v Speaker 1>now of income inequality.</v>

278
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:18.980
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened is that as women have become</v>

279
00:18:18.981 --> 00:18:22.040
<v Speaker 1>educated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like educated men will marry on educated</v>

280
00:18:22.041 --> 00:18:25.490
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but educated women will not marry on</v>

281
00:18:25.491 --> 00:18:27.680
<v Speaker 1>educated man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the,</v>

282
00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.900
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of what's what's happened as we've</v>

283
00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:34.901
<v Speaker 1>transformed our society increasingly</v>
<v Speaker 1>into an intellectual meritocracy that</v>

284
00:18:35.991 --> 00:18:38.330
<v Speaker 1>also allows the contribution of</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>

285
00:18:38.331 --> 00:18:42.200
<v Speaker 1>is that we've getting assorted of mating</v>
<v Speaker 1>between smart and conscientious people</v>

286
00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:45.410
<v Speaker 1>at the upper strata of the socioeconomic</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>

287
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:49.940
<v Speaker 1>And the estimates now are that about 25%</v>
<v Speaker 1>of its income inequality in North</v>

288
00:18:49.941 --> 00:18:52.020
<v Speaker 1>America as a consequence of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

289
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:56.000
<v Speaker 1>of the fact that women will only meet</v>
<v Speaker 1>across or up dominance hierarchies.</v>

290
00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.060
<v Speaker 1>So they won't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're looking for someone who is at</v>

291
00:18:59.061 --> 00:19:01.700
<v Speaker 1>least as competent as they are or more</v>
<v Speaker 1>competent.</v>

292
00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.090
<v Speaker 1>So depending of course on what you mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>by competent,</v>

293
00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:10.220
<v Speaker 1>whereas men are not the correlation</v>
<v Speaker 1>between women socioeconomic status and</v>

294
00:19:10.221 --> 00:19:12.440
<v Speaker 1>their mating opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it slightly negative?</v>

295
00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:16.220
<v Speaker 1>The correlation between men</v>
<v Speaker 1>socioeconomic status and their mating,</v>

296
00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:20.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential so to speak is about 0.5 0.6</v>

297
00:19:20.361 --> 00:19:23.690
<v Speaker 1>like that's a massive difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an unbelievably massive difference</v>

298
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:27.320
<v Speaker 1>and has very powerful sociological</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

299
00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Nature well understood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those processes that have been called</v>

300
00:19:31.451 --> 00:19:35.980
<v Speaker 1>defense mechanisms by Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly sublimation repression and</v>

301
00:19:35.981 --> 00:19:40.120
<v Speaker 1>the turning of instincts towards oneself</v>
<v Speaker 1>both give a new expression to did arose</v>

302
00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:43.900
<v Speaker 1>old assumption that modern man is</v>
<v Speaker 1>afflicted with a peculiar in illness</v>

303
00:19:43.901 --> 00:19:47.530
<v Speaker 1>bound up with civilization because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization demands of man,</v>

304
00:19:47.531 --> 00:19:50.410
<v Speaker 1>that he renounced the gratification of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his instincts.</v>

305
00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:54.020
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for Freud and and for neat shed,</v>

306
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:55.750
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they both,</v>

307
00:19:55.751 --> 00:19:58.990
<v Speaker 1>they both adopted a perspective that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>different from that of piaget.</v>

308
00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:03.520
<v Speaker 1>And I think piaget was actually correct</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Freud,</v>

309
00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:09.010
<v Speaker 1>the individuals striving upwards to</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest their true nature,</v>

310
00:20:09.011 --> 00:20:11.530
<v Speaker 1>which is in some ways can be quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>brutish.</v>

311
00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:15.280
<v Speaker 1>And what the Superego is doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what society is doing is actually</v>

312
00:20:15.281 --> 00:20:17.860
<v Speaker 1>inhibiting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's stopping it from happening.</v>

313
00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.240
<v Speaker 1>So it's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

314
00:20:19.241 --> 00:20:24.010
<v Speaker 1>it's as if society puts each individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a jail cell of sorts and only</v>

315
00:20:24.011 --> 00:20:26.770
<v Speaker 1>allows them to do certain things within</v>
<v Speaker 1>that cell.</v>

316
00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Now you can certainly understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

317
00:20:29.901 --> 00:20:33.370
<v Speaker 1>I think that is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more tyrannical as society becomes.</v>

318
00:20:33.371 --> 00:20:37.210
<v Speaker 1>And as Ellen Borchez pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Victorian society was quite</v>

319
00:20:37.211 --> 00:20:41.140
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the more authoritarian a society,</v>

320
00:20:41.141 --> 00:20:44.620
<v Speaker 1>the more there is a struggle between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual attempting to be an</v>

321
00:20:44.621 --> 00:20:48.940
<v Speaker 1>individual and the culture attempting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn into an absolutely predictable cog</v>

322
00:20:48.941 --> 00:20:50.830
<v Speaker 1>in a machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

323
00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:55.270
<v Speaker 1>pier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Freud of course viewed the primary</v>

324
00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:59.650
<v Speaker 1>conflicts and mental life as the ego</v>
<v Speaker 1>tortured by the end in some sense,</v>

325
00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being driven by underlying biological</v>

326
00:21:01.721 --> 00:21:05.820
<v Speaker 1>forces but also severely inhibited and</v>
<v Speaker 1>repressed by the Super Ego.</v>

327
00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:07.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

328
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.170
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

329
00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:11.770
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

330
00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:16.771
<v Speaker 1>if it's a perfectly persuasive model and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are situations under which it's</v>

331
00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.530
<v Speaker 1>more applicable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but piaget's idea that</v>

332
00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:29.290
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental conflict within people</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't necessarily social versus the</v>

333
00:21:29.331 --> 00:21:30.800
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Piaget,</v>

334
00:21:30.801 --> 00:21:35.480
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental conflict was between</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational systems and then between</v>

335
00:21:35.481 --> 00:21:38.420
<v Speaker 1>their expression across time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within the individual,</v>

336
00:21:38.421 --> 00:21:41.420
<v Speaker 1>and then between their expression across</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

337
00:21:41.421 --> 00:21:45.710
<v Speaker 1>within the individual in relationship to</v>
<v Speaker 1>all other individuals and to society.</v>

338
00:21:45.711 --> 00:21:50.711
<v Speaker 1>So it was more like a complex problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could be solved by a civilized game</v>

339
00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:55.850
<v Speaker 1>than it was a massive force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That being the Super Ego crushing the</v>

340
00:21:55.851 --> 00:22:00.620
<v Speaker 1>individual into submission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say that for neurotic</v>

341
00:22:00.621 --> 00:22:02.900
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and neurotic is a strange word,</v>

342
00:22:02.901 --> 00:22:05.060
<v Speaker 1>but we'll say for the sake of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

343
00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:08.120
<v Speaker 1>of argument right now that a neurotic</v>
<v Speaker 1>person who is,</v>

344
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:12.290
<v Speaker 1>it's suffering sufficiently from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions of their life for</v>

345
00:22:12.291 --> 00:22:16.700
<v Speaker 1>psychological reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that their life is not bearable in its</v>

346
00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:19.550
<v Speaker 1>current form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're suffering enough to interfere</v>

347
00:22:19.551 --> 00:22:22.170
<v Speaker 1>with their own movement forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

348
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.020
<v Speaker 1>what Freud says about the ego versus the</v>
<v Speaker 1>superego might well be true in the case</v>

349
00:22:28.021 --> 00:22:31.650
<v Speaker 1>of people who aren't well adapted</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they haven't been able to</v>

350
00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:36.680
<v Speaker 1>organize their own motivational drives</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a stable manner within themselves and</v>

351
00:22:37.021 --> 00:22:40.980
<v Speaker 1>then they haven't been socialized</v>
<v Speaker 1>effectively so that they can fit into</v>

352
00:22:40.981 --> 00:22:45.870
<v Speaker 1>the broader community like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a dancer might in a complex dance,</v>

353
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:51.000
<v Speaker 1>then they're much more likely to</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience the social world versus them,</v>

354
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:53.100
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're rejected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

355
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:56.490
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can't gratify any of their</v>

356
00:22:56.491 --> 00:23:00.900
<v Speaker 1>fundamental needs because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of their inability or their</v>

357
00:23:00.901 --> 00:23:03.780
<v Speaker 1>awkwardness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say to the degree that you're</v>

358
00:23:03.781 --> 00:23:06.540
<v Speaker 1>suffering from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from failure,</v>

359
00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:08.520
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for one reason or another,</v>

360
00:23:08.521 --> 00:23:13.521
<v Speaker 1>you're much more likely to see s the</v>
<v Speaker 1>social rules as a harsh and repressive</v>

361
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:15.990
<v Speaker 1>superego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously they're not doing you any</v>

362
00:23:15.991 --> 00:23:18.000
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that's probably more likely</v>

363
00:23:18.001 --> 00:23:21.510
<v Speaker 1>to happen if you're somewhat near the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of a given dominance hierarchy.</v>

364
00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:24.930
<v Speaker 1>And that also means if you're at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of a given dominance hierarchy,</v>

365
00:23:24.931 --> 00:23:29.931
<v Speaker 1>that you're more much more likely to</v>
<v Speaker 1>consider the spirit of the structure as</v>

366
00:23:30.091 --> 00:23:33.840
<v Speaker 1>an authoritarian spirit and a repressive</v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit because obviously it isn't making</v>

367
00:23:33.841 --> 00:23:37.020
<v Speaker 1>room for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes of course that's the case.</v>

368
00:23:37.021 --> 00:23:40.170
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of societies where everyone</v>

369
00:23:40.171 --> 00:23:45.171
<v Speaker 1>at the bottom has nothing and only the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people at the top have something you and</v>

370
00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:47.810
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to see how you could not view</v>

371
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:53.240
<v Speaker 1>the culture slash superego as something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was harsh and repressive and an</v>

372
00:23:53.241 --> 00:23:55.970
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian and crushing under those</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>

373
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:57.583
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

374
00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:06.900
<v Speaker 1>I also think that it was probably an</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that was more relevant during the</v>

375
00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.910
<v Speaker 1>initial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the,</v>

376
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:12.120
<v Speaker 1>the mid to late stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just say of the development of the</v>

377
00:24:12.121 --> 00:24:13.740
<v Speaker 1>industrial revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because</v>

378
00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:20.690
<v Speaker 1>to work in a factory meant something</v>
<v Speaker 1>very different than to work as a</v>

379
00:24:21.031 --> 00:24:22.740
<v Speaker 1>peasant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

380
00:24:22.741 --> 00:24:24.270
<v Speaker 1>if you were working in a factory where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

381
00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:28.440
<v Speaker 1>you became bound by time in a way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings had never been bound by</v>

382
00:24:28.441 --> 00:24:29.430
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

383
00:24:29.431 --> 00:24:31.880
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we time everything seconds means</v>

384
00:24:31.881 --> 00:24:33.750
<v Speaker 1>something to modern people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

385
00:24:33.751 --> 00:24:37.890
<v Speaker 1>But it took her a long time for the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

386
00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:41.330
<v Speaker 1>that the time was of the essence for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>organizing,</v>

387
00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:44.940
<v Speaker 1>organizing of human life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that occurred as people</v>

388
00:24:44.941 --> 00:24:49.410
<v Speaker 1>moved into the factories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can see for example,</v>

389
00:24:49.411 --> 00:24:52.980
<v Speaker 1>the the legacy of that in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the modern elementary,</v>

390
00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:58.380
<v Speaker 1>in the modern pre university school</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems because that school systems that</v>

391
00:24:58.381 --> 00:25:02.400
<v Speaker 1>most of you attended with their rows of</v>
<v Speaker 1>desks and their buzzers and their bells</v>

392
00:25:02.401 --> 00:25:07.401
<v Speaker 1>and their recesses are basically factory</v>
<v Speaker 1>structures that emerged from the</v>

393
00:25:09.181 --> 00:25:12.750
<v Speaker 1>industrial revolution that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of the way that working</v>

394
00:25:12.751 --> 00:25:15.200
<v Speaker 1>people who worked in factories organize</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives.</v>

395
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.410
<v Speaker 1>So the bells that go off between periods</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to announce that it's noon and to</v>

396
00:25:19.411 --> 00:25:22.200
<v Speaker 1>tell you that school's out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are factory bells.</v>

397
00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:27.120
<v Speaker 1>And so you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see echoes of Freud's idea that</v>

398
00:25:27.121 --> 00:25:31.470
<v Speaker 1>the super ego and the ego and the ID or</v>
<v Speaker 1>in conflict by imagining,</v>

399
00:25:31.471 --> 00:25:34.770
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how difficult it is for a very active</v>

400
00:25:34.771 --> 00:25:37.320
<v Speaker 1>six year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're male,</v>

401
00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:42.530
<v Speaker 1>to sit quietly and regulate themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the bell for six or seven hours.</v>

402
00:25:43.591 --> 00:25:45.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they first go to grade one.</v>

403
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:47.460
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

404
00:25:47.461 --> 00:25:51.660
<v Speaker 1>Freud would say if he was alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the reason that so many people have</v>

405
00:25:51.661 --> 00:25:55.680
<v Speaker 1>attention deficit disorder is because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the demands of the Superego,</v>

406
00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:58.260
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the school system are so excessive</v>

407
00:25:58.261 --> 00:26:01.680
<v Speaker 1>that there's the clash produces</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathology.</v>

408
00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:04.590
<v Speaker 1>Now the pathology is obviously defined</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the situation.</v>

409
00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:09.630
<v Speaker 1>If you define pathology as being unable</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sit down and pay attention to things</v>

410
00:26:09.631 --> 00:26:12.710
<v Speaker 1>that are deadly boring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you should be running around</v>

411
00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.540
<v Speaker 1>playing and having fun and wearing</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to a frazzle,</v>

412
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:17.070
<v Speaker 1>then that's pathology.</v>

413
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:20.910
<v Speaker 1>That's attention deficit disorder and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can treat it with Ritalin.</v>

414
00:26:20.911 --> 00:26:23.610
<v Speaker 1>But that's only because you can treat</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody with Ritalin.</v>

415
00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.400
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I'm sure many of you know,</v>

416
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.330
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>red is an amphetamine and it makes you</v>

417
00:26:30.331 --> 00:26:33.240
<v Speaker 1>focus more on whatever you happen to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>focused on.</v>

418
00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Though there's no real evidence that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>provides any boost in academic</v>

419
00:26:36.961 --> 00:26:38.760
<v Speaker 1>achievement over any reasonable amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of time.</v>

420
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.440
<v Speaker 1>But if you think about it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

421
00:26:40.441 --> 00:26:45.441
<v Speaker 1>you can understand what Freud meant by</v>
<v Speaker 1>this super ego versus ego conflict or</v>

422
00:26:45.991 --> 00:26:50.430
<v Speaker 1>the Super Ego ego in conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Attention deficit disorder is a perfect</v>

423
00:26:50.431 --> 00:26:54.150
<v Speaker 1>example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the pathology is defined by the</v>

424
00:26:54.151 --> 00:26:56.790
<v Speaker 1>circumstance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we didn't have schools that are like</v>

425
00:26:56.791 --> 00:26:59.670
<v Speaker 1>the schools we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't have attention deficit</v>

426
00:26:59.671 --> 00:27:01.500
<v Speaker 1>disorder as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

427
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:04.020
<v Speaker 1>as a pathology now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people like to think about it as a</v>

428
00:27:04.021 --> 00:27:05.640
<v Speaker 1>scientific category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

429
00:27:05.641 --> 00:27:09.210
<v Speaker 1>it's a disease and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

430
00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:11.130
<v Speaker 1>diseases like an objective entity.</v>

431
00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:11.701
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

432
00:27:11.701 --> 00:27:13.740
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a disease and it's not an</v>

433
00:27:13.741 --> 00:27:17.610
<v Speaker 1>objective entity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a socio cultural construction.</v>

434
00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.700
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are certain people who are going</v>

435
00:27:20.701 --> 00:27:23.730
<v Speaker 1>to be more prone to be diagnosed with it</v>
<v Speaker 1>than others.</v>

436
00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:25.990
<v Speaker 1>And that would mostly be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

437
00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:31.970
<v Speaker 1>extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>open extroverted kids because they're</v>

438
00:27:32.041 --> 00:27:34.140
<v Speaker 1>not going to sit down and shut up</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they can't.</v>

439
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:38.370
<v Speaker 1>They're extremely curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And mostly what they want to do is talk</v>

440
00:27:38.371 --> 00:27:40.020
<v Speaker 1>to everyone in play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

441
00:27:40.021 --> 00:27:44.310
<v Speaker 1>Panksepp Jaak Panksepp Jaak Panksepp</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually has done really interesting</v>

442
00:27:44.311 --> 00:27:48.300
<v Speaker 1>experiments with male rats and he showed</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you deprive male juvenile rats</v>

443
00:27:48.301 --> 00:27:51.110
<v Speaker 1>of rough and tumble play there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

444
00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:58.170
<v Speaker 1>their prefrontal cortex doesn't mature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also a real hats off to</v>

445
00:27:58.651 --> 00:28:03.651
<v Speaker 1>piaget's theory of play as critical for</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher levels of development and that</v>

446
00:28:03.931 --> 00:28:07.560
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can also inhibit their tendency to</v>

447
00:28:07.561 --> 00:28:10.200
<v Speaker 1>play using Ritalin.</v>

448
00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:12.523
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

449
00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:16.430
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in fact it's appalling really.</v>

450
00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:19.160
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I see people in my clinical practice</v>

451
00:28:19.161 --> 00:28:22.610
<v Speaker 1>fairly frequently who come in and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they were diagnosed with adhd when</v>

452
00:28:22.611 --> 00:28:24.500
<v Speaker 1>they were like four or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

453
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:25.850
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

454
00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:30.000
<v Speaker 4>pathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's pathetic that that happens.</v>

455
00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of what Freud did was an</v>

456
00:28:34.101 --> 00:28:37.550
<v Speaker 1>analysis of his own fantasies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course we wouldn't consider that</v>

457
00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:40.970
<v Speaker 1>necessarily inappropriate methodology</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the scientific perspective.</v>

458
00:28:40.971 --> 00:28:43.880
<v Speaker 1>But there's something that you need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>know about the scientific perspective</v>

459
00:28:43.881 --> 00:28:47.990
<v Speaker 1>that people never talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly what you learned about in</v>

460
00:28:47.991 --> 00:28:52.991
<v Speaker 1>psychology when you're being taught</v>
<v Speaker 1>experimental techniques in psychology is</v>

461
00:28:53.031 --> 00:28:54.980
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis testing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

462
00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.400
<v Speaker 1>But no one ever talks to you about</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis generation.</v>

463
00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:01.130
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea there is that while you have a</v>

464
00:29:01.131 --> 00:29:04.490
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis and then you lay out an</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment and test it,</v>

465
00:29:04.491 --> 00:29:05.900
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>

466
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:11.230
<v Speaker 1>but coming up with a hypothesis to begin</v>
<v Speaker 1>with is like you just don't find them</v>

467
00:29:11.571 --> 00:29:14.000
<v Speaker 1>lying around on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

468
00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:16.760
<v Speaker 1>you have to think the mop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

469
00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:21.280
<v Speaker 1>the scientific process is hypothesis</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation.</v>

470
00:29:21.281 --> 00:29:23.590
<v Speaker 1>That's the first part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then hypothesis testing.</v>

471
00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:25.790
<v Speaker 1>And then the third part of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

472
00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:31.270
<v Speaker 1>generalization from the test to the real</v>
<v Speaker 1>world in psychologists never talk about</v>

473
00:29:31.271 --> 00:29:34.240
<v Speaker 1>the first step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They concentrate obsessively on the</v>

474
00:29:34.241 --> 00:29:36.970
<v Speaker 1>second and they ignore the third almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>

475
00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:41.740
<v Speaker 1>So because we just assumed</v>
<v Speaker 1>generalization from lab to the real</v>

476
00:29:41.741 --> 00:29:43.570
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we never actually checked to see if</v>

477
00:29:43.571 --> 00:29:46.240
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's very seldom true because the</v>

478
00:29:46.241 --> 00:29:50.390
<v Speaker 1>real world tends to be a lot more</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex and difficult and ornery and,</v>

479
00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:55.510
<v Speaker 1>and uncooperative than the lab does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you don't have to discuss your</v>

480
00:29:55.871 --> 00:29:57.730
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So funny because if you're writing a</v>

481
00:29:57.731 --> 00:30:00.640
<v Speaker 1>scientific paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually generally falsify your,</v>

482
00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:03.610
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lie about how you came up with your</v>

483
00:30:03.611 --> 00:30:06.020
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis basically because you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

484
00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:09.790
<v Speaker 1>you do a literature review and you show</v>
<v Speaker 1>how your hypothesis is extracted as a</v>

485
00:30:09.791 --> 00:30:13.330
<v Speaker 1>logical conclusion from all of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading that you've done in the truth of</v>

486
00:30:13.331 --> 00:30:15.250
<v Speaker 1>the matter is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you were sitting with your graduate</v>

487
00:30:15.251 --> 00:30:19.390
<v Speaker 1>students in the bar drinking beer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone said something funny and then</v>

488
00:30:19.391 --> 00:30:21.220
<v Speaker 1>maybe you thought of something you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>test.</v>

489
00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:22.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to write that down in</v>

490
00:30:22.811 --> 00:30:26.670
<v Speaker 1>your intro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody's quite funny because you see</v>

491
00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:29.560
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite amusing because we really</v>

492
00:30:29.561 --> 00:30:32.980
<v Speaker 1>don't talk about how we generate</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypotheses in our paper.</v>

493
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:36.550
<v Speaker 1>We act as if it's a consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>logical,</v>

494
00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:39.520
<v Speaker 1>of induction or logical deduction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not,</v>

495
00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:41.200
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very seldom that,</v>

496
00:30:41.201 --> 00:30:43.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you're reading along and you</v>

497
00:30:43.061 --> 00:30:43.894
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

498
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:47.890
<v Speaker 1>that idea and this idea of fit together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even then you rarely,</v>

499
00:30:47.891 --> 00:30:50.410
<v Speaker 1>like I've found that often when I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>an idea,</v>

500
00:30:50.411 --> 00:30:52.750
<v Speaker 1>it's what comes from this literature</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

501
00:30:52.751 --> 00:30:57.040
<v Speaker 1>And then from this literature over here</v>
<v Speaker 1>and trying to actually explain how I got</v>

502
00:30:57.041 --> 00:31:00.670
<v Speaker 1>that idea in an introduction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can't,</v>

503
00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:02.650
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have the space.</v>

504
00:31:02.651 --> 00:31:04.550
<v Speaker 1>And so it's quite funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

505
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:06.370
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

506
00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:10.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really think that it's a lie.</v>

507
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:12.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a format,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

508
00:31:12.431 --> 00:31:13.031
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

509
00:31:13.031 --> 00:31:15.220
<v Speaker 1>it's a mode of doing things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

510
00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:21.190
<v Speaker 1>but it has nothing to do with hypothesis</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation and Freud,</v>

511
00:31:21.191 --> 00:31:23.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud used his imagination and he,</v>

512
00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:26.170
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he used his ability to think.</v>

513
00:31:26.171 --> 00:31:28.360
<v Speaker 1>And so that's both imagined that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>production,</v>

514
00:31:28.361 --> 00:31:31.540
<v Speaker 1>which is basically creativity and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>rationality,</v>

515
00:31:31.541 --> 00:31:34.600
<v Speaker 1>which is logical thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he generated all sorts of hypotheses</v>

516
00:31:34.601 --> 00:31:38.980
<v Speaker 1>and his task wasn't a lab test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a test in practice.</v>

517
00:31:38.981 --> 00:31:40.480
<v Speaker 1>So his idea was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

518
00:31:40.481 --> 00:31:43.150
<v Speaker 1>I've got this notion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll try laying it out in,</v>

519
00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:45.010
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the therapeutic process.</v>

520
00:31:45.011 --> 00:31:49.210
<v Speaker 1>It'll make observations about how that</v>
<v Speaker 1>plays itself out.</v>

521
00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:49.810
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

522
00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:53.410
<v Speaker 1>you could consider that relatively weak</v>
<v Speaker 1>methodology from a scientific</v>

523
00:31:53.411 --> 00:31:55.120
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I got to tell you something about</v>

524
00:31:55.121 --> 00:31:55.990
<v Speaker 1>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

525
00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:57.123
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

526
00:31:58.810 --> 00:31:59.630
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

527
00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:01.610
<v Speaker 1>you may know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may not know that there were two</v>

528
00:32:01.611 --> 00:32:06.320
<v Speaker 1>streams of animal experiments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal behavioral science in the 20th</v>

529
00:32:06.321 --> 00:32:07.970
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they still exist.</v>

530
00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:12.170
<v Speaker 1>One was behaviorism and other was he</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought energy.</v>

531
00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Now there's some pretty famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thought logist um,</v>

532
00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:20.330
<v Speaker 1>Conrad Laurens was neatologist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dickless Tinbergen was an anthologist.</v>

533
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:25.630
<v Speaker 1>Frans de Waal now who studied primates</v>
<v Speaker 1>and mostly primates in the zoo,</v>

534
00:32:25.641 --> 00:32:28.250
<v Speaker 1>mostly chimpanzees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jane Goodall.</v>

535
00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Those people are only theologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what they do is they go out into the</v>

536
00:32:32.301 --> 00:32:35.840
<v Speaker 1>natural habitat of animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blanchards who study rats and their</v>

537
00:32:35.841 --> 00:32:37.880
<v Speaker 1>natural habitat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or another example.</v>

538
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:39.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's philosophy,</v>

539
00:32:39.831 --> 00:32:40.664
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

540
00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:44.750
<v Speaker 1>who studied gorillas there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seemed to be women all the time who</v>

541
00:32:44.751 --> 00:32:47.660
<v Speaker 1>go out into the wilderness and observed</v>
<v Speaker 1>primates.</v>

542
00:32:47.661 --> 00:32:48.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite interesting.</v>

543
00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're more interested in the</v>

544
00:32:50.931 --> 00:32:53.540
<v Speaker 1>social behavior or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is quite striking.</v>

545
00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:56.390
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thought logist what they do is they</v>

546
00:32:56.391 --> 00:32:58.880
<v Speaker 1>go look at animals behaved in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural environment.</v>

547
00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.490
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you kind of end up with a</v>

548
00:33:01.491 --> 00:33:06.491
<v Speaker 1>narrative description of their behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not as technical as the</v>

549
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:10.670
<v Speaker 1>observations that you produce if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>working on lab animals.</v>

550
00:33:10.671 --> 00:33:14.030
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a lab animal and a normal animal are</v>

551
00:33:14.031 --> 00:33:16.120
<v Speaker 1>not really very similar at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

552
00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:19.650
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things you probably don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know is that win,</v>

553
00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:20.750
<v Speaker 1>win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>win.</v>

554
00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:26.000
<v Speaker 1>Skinner was experimenting on rats and</v>
<v Speaker 1>skinner.</v>

555
00:33:26.001 --> 00:33:27.290
<v Speaker 1>He was a smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

556
00:33:27.291 --> 00:33:30.650
<v Speaker 1>We learned a lot from skinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He kind of laid the groundwork for the</v>

557
00:33:30.651 --> 00:33:34.490
<v Speaker 1>methods that are used by sophisticated</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroscientists,</v>

558
00:33:34.491 --> 00:33:37.850
<v Speaker 1>especially those who work with animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're really the ones who do the</v>

559
00:33:37.851 --> 00:33:39.980
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He laid down the groundwork for that</v>

560
00:33:39.981 --> 00:33:42.500
<v Speaker 1>sort of investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like I don't have any</v>

561
00:33:42.501 --> 00:33:44.120
<v Speaker 1>respect for skinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like he,</v>

562
00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:48.170
<v Speaker 1>he knew exactly what he was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He started his damn rats down to three</v>

563
00:33:48.171 --> 00:33:49.790
<v Speaker 1>quarters of their normal body weight.</v>

564
00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:55.490
<v Speaker 1>So the Skinnerian rat was first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitterly lonesome because he lived in a</v>

565
00:33:55.491 --> 00:33:57.980
<v Speaker 1>cage all by himself and that isn't how</v>
<v Speaker 1>rats live.</v>

566
00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:03.340
<v Speaker 1>And then he was like starving to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he would work like mad for food.</v>

567
00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:06.410
<v Speaker 1>And so what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what skinner did in some sense was take</v>

568
00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:10.550
<v Speaker 1>a complex animal and simplify it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>simplify the hell out of it by making it</v>

569
00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:14.660
<v Speaker 1>isolated and starving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he could observe its behavior</v>

570
00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:17.540
<v Speaker 1>under those conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could extract a tremendous</v>

571
00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:21.920
<v Speaker 1>amount of information out about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals behave by us by using a</v>

572
00:34:21.921 --> 00:34:25.130
<v Speaker 1>simplified animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you lose a lot too.</v>

573
00:34:25.131 --> 00:34:29.510
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty easy to get starved board</v>

574
00:34:29.511 --> 00:34:34.310
<v Speaker 1>lab rats to take cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll do it or so if you give them</v>

575
00:34:34.311 --> 00:34:35.900
<v Speaker 1>free access to cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

576
00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:37.670
<v Speaker 1>they'll just take it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

577
00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:41.180
<v Speaker 1>they won't even eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you have a raft out there in rat</v>

578
00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:41.901
<v Speaker 1>land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

579
00:34:41.901 --> 00:34:44.120
<v Speaker 1>so that you give them a social</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment and it's,</v>

580
00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:48.020
<v Speaker 1>it's a setup so that it's like a normal</v>
<v Speaker 1>rat would have the rights aren't that</v>

581
00:34:48.021 --> 00:34:49.190
<v Speaker 1>interested in cocaine.</v>

582
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:54.410
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see how the context there is a</v>

583
00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:57.200
<v Speaker 1>major determinant of the outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Freud,</v>

584
00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:00.500
<v Speaker 1>I would think of Freud and all the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>clinicians more as ethan logistics.</v>

585
00:35:00.501 --> 00:35:03.050
<v Speaker 1>Then as behavioral scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

586
00:35:03.051 --> 00:35:06.680
<v Speaker 1>and Frans de Waal for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a great person to read if you</v>

587
00:35:06.681 --> 00:35:08.380
<v Speaker 1>haven't read anything by friends to</v>
<v Speaker 1>wallets,</v>

588
00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:08.991
<v Speaker 1>F,</v>
<v Speaker 1>R,</v>

589
00:35:08.991 --> 00:35:09.501
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>n,</v>

590
00:35:09.501 --> 00:35:11.060
<v Speaker 1>s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>d,</v>

591
00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.350
<v Speaker 1>w,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

592
00:35:12.351 --> 00:35:13.640
<v Speaker 1>l,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's,</v>

593
00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:18.730
<v Speaker 1>he's like a piaget Gideon for chimps and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he's observed over a series of</v>

594
00:35:19.641 --> 00:35:22.550
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly making observations at the rnm</v>

595
00:35:22.551 --> 00:35:26.630
<v Speaker 1>zoo in the Netherlands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the emergence of morality among</v>

596
00:35:26.631 --> 00:35:29.570
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees as a consequence of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>social interactions.</v>

597
00:35:29.571 --> 00:35:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that simple because the morale,</v>

598
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:36.110
<v Speaker 1>the ground for morality emerges as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the way the chimps</v>

599
00:35:36.111 --> 00:35:38.610
<v Speaker 1>organize themselves into dominant</v>
<v Speaker 1>structures.</v>

600
00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:41.580
<v Speaker 1>So there's a sociological element,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

601
00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:45.390
<v Speaker 1>but by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chimps are biologically prepared to</v>

602
00:35:45.391 --> 00:35:48.960
<v Speaker 1>inhabit dominance hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a continual interaction</v>

603
00:35:48.961 --> 00:35:52.530
<v Speaker 1>between the social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the social structuring of the behavioral</v>

604
00:35:52.531 --> 00:35:57.240
<v Speaker 1>patterns in the dominance hierarchy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evolutionary success of the chimp.</v>

605
00:35:57.241 --> 00:35:58.500
<v Speaker 1>Because think about it this way,</v>

606
00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:02.170
<v Speaker 1>the higher you are in a dominance</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

607
00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.630
<v Speaker 1>the more likely it is that you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to leave offspring.</v>

608
00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so obviously,</v>

609
00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:11.310
<v Speaker 1>obviously what that means is that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>more prepared you are biologically to</v>

610
00:36:12.161 --> 00:36:14.680
<v Speaker 1>succeed at a dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more likely you are to be</v>

611
00:36:14.681 --> 00:36:16.810
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in human beings,</v>

612
00:36:16.811 --> 00:36:18.820
<v Speaker 1>it's a major issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially for men,</v>

613
00:36:18.821 --> 00:36:21.910
<v Speaker 1>because if they're not successful in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>male dominance hierarchy,</v>

614
00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:26.050
<v Speaker 1>they do not leave any offspring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

615
00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:28.780
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of you won't be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe this,</v>

616
00:36:28.781 --> 00:36:30.910
<v Speaker 1>but if you sit and think about it for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>

617
00:36:30.911 --> 00:36:32.740
<v Speaker 1>you'll figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's true.</v>

618
00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:38.220
<v Speaker 1>You have twice as many female ancestors</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you do mail ancestors.</v>

619
00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.930
<v Speaker 1>Now you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can that be possible?</v>

620
00:36:40.931 --> 00:36:43.840
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is the APP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your average forefather.</v>

621
00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:53.250
<v Speaker 1>If every woman has a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only every second man has a child,</v>

622
00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.620
<v Speaker 1>then that's exactly what you end up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

623
00:36:55.621 --> 00:36:56.880
<v Speaker 1>Every second man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

624
00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:59.430
<v Speaker 1>in that case would have two children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

625
00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:01.410
<v Speaker 1>But that could easily happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

626
00:37:01.411 --> 00:37:02.280
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

627
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:07.550
<v Speaker 1>if you could imagine a situation where</v>
<v Speaker 1>one man made 10,000 women pregnant.</v>

628
00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:09.400
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

629
00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.910
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not as much of an impossibility</v>

630
00:37:11.911 --> 00:37:15.130
<v Speaker 1>as he might think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you obviously under conditions like</v>

631
00:37:15.131 --> 00:37:17.020
<v Speaker 1>that you'd have far more female</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestors,</v>

632
00:37:17.021 --> 00:37:19.240
<v Speaker 1>then you would have male ancestor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

633
00:37:19.241 --> 00:37:20.074
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

634
00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:22.500
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

635
00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Freud and young and the other clinicians</v>
<v Speaker 1>are basically ethos adjusts and what</v>

636
00:37:27.541 --> 00:37:29.910
<v Speaker 1>they're doing is studying human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their route,</v>

637
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.900
<v Speaker 1>relatively natural environment and</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out how they work.</v>

638
00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:39.530
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't obvious to me that</v>
<v Speaker 1>prolonged observation over multiple</v>

639
00:37:41.581 --> 00:37:46.581
<v Speaker 1>years of many people in a clinical</v>
<v Speaker 1>setting where you talk about everything</v>

640
00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:50.790
<v Speaker 1>is a less realistic way of gathering</v>
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>

641
00:37:50.791 --> 00:37:55.791
<v Speaker 1>especially for generating hypotheses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then assessing 40 undergraduates for 20</v>

642
00:37:57.331 --> 00:37:59.430
<v Speaker 1>minutes in the lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

643
00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:02.730
<v Speaker 1>now I think what you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that you can be more</v>

644
00:38:02.731 --> 00:38:06.450
<v Speaker 1>specific in the lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can do high resolution work in a</v>

645
00:38:06.451 --> 00:38:10.560
<v Speaker 1>lab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can do low resolution work as a</v>

646
00:38:10.561 --> 00:38:13.290
<v Speaker 1>clinician.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I do think that it's at the low</v>

647
00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:17.220
<v Speaker 1>resolution levels of theorizing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the hypotheses are generated.</v>

648
00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these things have to play against one</v>

649
00:38:20.701 --> 00:38:24.510
<v Speaker 1>another and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not reasonable to presume that one</v>

650
00:38:24.511 --> 00:38:29.511
<v Speaker 1>mode of evidence gathering is superior</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the other in all situations.</v>

651
00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:32.473
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

652
00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.490
<v Speaker 1>this is by Freud's Ernest Jones</v>

653
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:41.490
<v Speaker 4>who was a great admirer of Freud and who</v>
<v Speaker 4>really established the ground on which</v>

654
00:38:42.671 --> 00:38:44.890
<v Speaker 4>the history of psychoanalysis was going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be written.</v>

655
00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.113
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

656
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:50.400
<v Speaker 1>he's been accused of being too much of</v>
<v Speaker 1>an acolyte and I think there's some</v>

657
00:38:50.401 --> 00:38:53.280
<v Speaker 1>truth in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I guess you pretty behalf to be</v>

658
00:38:53.281 --> 00:38:55.980
<v Speaker 1>pretty interested in someone before</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to write their biography so</v>

659
00:38:55.981 --> 00:38:58.980
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't be too hard on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the summer of 1897,</v>

660
00:38:58.981 --> 00:39:03.270
<v Speaker 1>Freud undertook is most heroic seat a</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysis of his own unconscious.</v>

661
00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:07.140
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for us nowadays to imagine how</v>
<v Speaker 1>momentous this achievement was.</v>

662
00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:10.650
<v Speaker 1>That difficulty being the fate of most</v>
<v Speaker 1>pioneering exploits you up.</v>

663
00:39:10.651 --> 00:39:13.230
<v Speaker 1>The uniqueness of the feet remains once</v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

664
00:39:13.231 --> 00:39:15.690
<v Speaker 1>It has done forever for no one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

665
00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:20.220
<v Speaker 1>it can be the first to explore those</v>
<v Speaker 1>steps and the long history of humanity.</v>

666
00:39:20.221 --> 00:39:24.170
<v Speaker 1>The task had often been attempted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Philosophers and writers from Salon to</v>

667
00:39:24.171 --> 00:39:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Monteen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from juvenile to Schopenhauer had essay</v>

668
00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:31.730
<v Speaker 1>to follow the advice of the delphic</v>
<v Speaker 1>oracle know thyself,</v>

669
00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.570
<v Speaker 1>but it also come to the effort.</v>

670
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Inner resistances had borrowed advance</v>
<v Speaker 1>there had from time to time being</v>

671
00:39:37.291 --> 00:39:42.030
<v Speaker 1>flashes of intuition to point the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they had always flickered out the</v>

672
00:39:42.031 --> 00:39:45.990
<v Speaker 1>realm of the unconscious whose existence</v>
<v Speaker 1>was so often postulated,</v>

673
00:39:45.991 --> 00:39:48.600
<v Speaker 1>remained dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the words of hereclitis still stood.</v>

674
00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:52.170
<v Speaker 1>The soul of man is a far country which</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot be approached or explored.</v>

675
00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Freud had no help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one to assist the undertaking in the</v>

676
00:39:56.101 --> 00:39:58.860
<v Speaker 1>slightest degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worse than this.</v>

677
00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:02.490
<v Speaker 1>The very thing that drove him onward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he must've dimly divined could only</v>

678
00:40:02.491 --> 00:40:06.210
<v Speaker 1>result in profoundly affecting his</v>
<v Speaker 1>relations or perhaps even severing them</v>

679
00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:09.370
<v Speaker 1>with the one being to whom he was so</v>
<v Speaker 1>closely bounded who had studied this</v>

680
00:40:09.371 --> 00:40:12.360
<v Speaker 1>mental equilibrium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was daring much in risking bunch.</v>

681
00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:14.130
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indomitable courage.</v>

682
00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.290
<v Speaker 1>Both intellectual and moral must've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>needed,</v>

683
00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:18.930
<v Speaker 1>but it was forthcoming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

684
00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:20.213
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

685
00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:23.890
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

686
00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:29.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that prior to Freud and</v>

687
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:34.150
<v Speaker 1>chip</v>
<v Speaker 1>Western civilization in particular,</v>

688
00:40:34.151 --> 00:40:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Western philosophical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the western philosophical tradition,</v>

689
00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:43.350
<v Speaker 1>absolutely overvalued the role that</v>
<v Speaker 1>rationality played in the realm of human</v>

690
00:40:45.071 --> 00:40:46.740
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

691
00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:49.090
<v Speaker 1>emotions and people still think this</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

692
00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:54.330
<v Speaker 1>Emotions were often considered the enemy</v>
<v Speaker 1>of reason and motivations.</v>

693
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:57.040
<v Speaker 1>Also the enemy of reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can understand that,</v>

694
00:40:57.041 --> 00:40:59.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because your,</v>

695
00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:04.470
<v Speaker 1>your observations of a given phenomenon</v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to be biased by the emotions</v>

696
00:41:05.801 --> 00:41:08.170
<v Speaker 1>and the motivations that you bring to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the forefront.</v>

697
00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:12.040
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of what scientists we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to do as they learned how to be</v>

698
00:41:12.041 --> 00:41:14.260
<v Speaker 1>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where to get the damn emotions and the</v>

699
00:41:14.261 --> 00:41:18.850
<v Speaker 1>motivations out of the way and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal biases system by esis and the</v>

700
00:41:18.851 --> 00:41:22.090
<v Speaker 1>demand to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to elevate your career and to be right</v>

701
00:41:22.091 --> 00:41:24.610
<v Speaker 1>and to beat the other primates and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>forth and so on.</v>

702
00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.590
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to clear that out so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

703
00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:29.500
<v Speaker 1>you could attend clearly to certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>classes of phenomena.</v>

704
00:41:29.501 --> 00:41:34.501
<v Speaker 1>And then of course</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a post renaissance phenomena to</v>

705
00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:42.580
<v Speaker 1>identify the central being of human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings with rationality.</v>

706
00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:48.020
<v Speaker 1>And furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is also a deeper idea than that,</v>

707
00:41:48.021 --> 00:41:50.210
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we all still fall prey to in many</v>

708
00:41:50.211 --> 00:41:52.640
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that idea was essentially that human</v>

709
00:41:52.641 --> 00:41:55.880
<v Speaker 1>beings had a soul that was separate from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body.</v>

710
00:41:56.750 --> 00:42:00.740
<v Speaker 1>And so the central nature of the soul</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it was operating properly was</v>

711
00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:05.800
<v Speaker 1>rational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I can understand why humanities</v>

712
00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:09.050
<v Speaker 1>always had the idea that people have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>soul and that there's a body,</v>

713
00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:12.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think it's an obvious</v>

714
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:17.030
<v Speaker 1>reflection of the fact that we have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>identifiable consciousness that seems</v>

715
00:42:17.031 --> 00:42:20.030
<v Speaker 1>unique and individual and it's wandering</v>
<v Speaker 1>around in a body,</v>

716
00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:22.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they seem separable in some way.</v>

717
00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:27.320
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't until Freud that people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

718
00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.500
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are serious about</v>

719
00:42:30.501 --> 00:42:33.950
<v Speaker 1>understanding the human psyche had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>really grapple with the fact that we</v>

720
00:42:33.951 --> 00:42:36.050
<v Speaker 1>were embodied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that our,</v>

721
00:42:36.051 --> 00:42:38.990
<v Speaker 1>our rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the way our rationality</v>

722
00:42:38.991 --> 00:42:43.220
<v Speaker 1>really works is that it doesn't even get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to work until it's pre filtered by</v>

723
00:42:43.221 --> 00:42:46.100
<v Speaker 1>emotions and motivations and the body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

724
00:42:46.101 --> 00:42:49.760
<v Speaker 1>So you could think about rationality as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the master of the ship,</v>

725
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:50.580
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

726
00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:53.090
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps that was the way to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it before Freud,</v>

727
00:42:53.091 --> 00:42:55.520
<v Speaker 1>but after Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is how we think now,</v>

728
00:42:55.521 --> 00:42:56.031
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

729
00:42:56.031 --> 00:42:56.330
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

730
00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:59.470
<v Speaker 1>First year a body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that screens out most everything</v>

731
00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:00.770
<v Speaker 1>instructors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you see.</v>

732
00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:03.200
<v Speaker 1>And then inside that you're a set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations.</v>

733
00:43:03.201 --> 00:43:04.850
<v Speaker 1>You're always motivated one way or</v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

734
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:09.890
<v Speaker 1>And then inside that you're emotionally</v>
<v Speaker 1>evaluating things before they even reach</v>

735
00:43:09.891 --> 00:43:11.390
<v Speaker 1>your rational consciousness.</v>

736
00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:14.270
<v Speaker 1>And then inside that there's a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>rational guy who's,</v>

737
00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:16.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to zip around and make</v>

738
00:43:16.251 --> 00:43:20.030
<v Speaker 1>intelligent decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But without all that underpinning,</v>

739
00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:22.730
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't even be able to operate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>

740
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:26.450
<v Speaker 1>this is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why the farthest that people</v>

741
00:43:26.451 --> 00:43:30.740
<v Speaker 1>have gone in the pursuit of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence is with embodied</v>

742
00:43:30.741 --> 00:43:33.020
<v Speaker 1>robots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>embodied cognitive agents.</v>

743
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:36.560
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that you can't have pure</v>
<v Speaker 1>rationality without the body.</v>

744
00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:41.590
<v Speaker 1>And so in Freud is you just can't escape</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that Freud was the person who</v>

745
00:43:42.291 --> 00:43:44.870
<v Speaker 1>was beating the drum for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective for,</v>

746
00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:48.140
<v Speaker 1>for 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he did it extraordinarily</v>

747
00:43:48.141 --> 00:43:53.090
<v Speaker 1>successfully after Friday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could never pretend that you weren't</v>

748
00:43:53.091 --> 00:43:58.000
<v Speaker 1>a sexual being or an aggressive being or</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bias being or an unconscious being or</v>

749
00:43:58.030 --> 00:44:00.890
<v Speaker 1>defended being or repressing being are</v>
<v Speaker 1>allying,</v>

750
00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:04.820
<v Speaker 1>being while you were doing whatever it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that you were doing.</v>

751
00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:06.890
<v Speaker 1>And those things had to be taken into</v>
<v Speaker 1>account.</v>

752
00:44:06.891 --> 00:44:08.480
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

753
00:44:08.590 --> 00:44:13.590
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't much before Freud that Darwin</v>
<v Speaker 1>came up with his Darwinian hypothesis.</v>

754
00:44:14.211 --> 00:44:15.380
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

755
00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:17.840
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was exactly at that time that it was</v>

756
00:44:17.841 --> 00:44:22.841
<v Speaker 1>necessary for us to understand our</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary kinship or in some sense</v>

757
00:44:23.931 --> 00:44:28.880
<v Speaker 1>even identity with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with other creatures ranging from those</v>

758
00:44:28.881 --> 00:44:30.800
<v Speaker 1>that were quite like us to those that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

759
00:44:30.801 --> 00:44:34.440
<v Speaker 1>are very much unlike us all the way down</v>
<v Speaker 1>the a genetic chain.</v>

760
00:44:34.441 --> 00:44:37.740
<v Speaker 1>There's tremendously important</v>
<v Speaker 1>interrelationships.</v>

761
00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:41.430
<v Speaker 1>And so Freud's idea fit into Darwin's</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea like mad,</v>

762
00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:43.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden human beings,</v>

763
00:44:43.171 --> 00:44:47.220
<v Speaker 1>we're animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't a divine soul in a body.</v>

764
00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Now the divine soul idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has its merits,</v>

765
00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:56.510
<v Speaker 1>but the animal idea has its merits to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was Freud who sort of rub</v>

766
00:44:56.881 --> 00:45:00.810
<v Speaker 1>people's noses in the fact that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were animals along with Darwin.</v>

767
00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:03.750
<v Speaker 1>And that was part of the reason why he</v>
<v Speaker 1>faced such resistance.</v>

768
00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:09.140
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud was definitely an ally of the</v>

769
00:45:09.421 --> 00:45:12.780
<v Speaker 1>evolution of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the idea of evolutionary biology.</v>

770
00:45:12.781 --> 00:45:16.950
<v Speaker 1>And I also think he was a real precursor</v>
<v Speaker 1>in many ways or perhaps the</v>

771
00:45:16.951 --> 00:45:19.800
<v Speaker 1>groundbreaker for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the development of fields like</v>

772
00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:22.170
<v Speaker 1>affect of neuroscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

773
00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:27.320
<v Speaker 1>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a relatively new field until well</v>

774
00:45:27.361 --> 00:45:30.480
<v Speaker 1>until the 1960s in psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you weren't even allowed to think that</v>

775
00:45:30.481 --> 00:45:35.481
<v Speaker 1>people thought wasn't until the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive revolution that psychologists</v>

776
00:45:35.831 --> 00:45:38.670
<v Speaker 1>were willing to think that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought and that may be animals dead.</v>

777
00:45:38.671 --> 00:45:41.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean everyone else on the bloody</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet knew that people thought,</v>

778
00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:43.980
<v Speaker 1>but the psychologist were refusing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>admit it.</v>

779
00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:48.810
<v Speaker 1>And that was because they were using</v>
<v Speaker 1>strictly behavioral propositions in</v>

780
00:45:48.811 --> 00:45:50.730
<v Speaker 1>their lab work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there were some real utility in</v>

781
00:45:50.731 --> 00:45:52.920
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the cognitive scientists came along</v>

782
00:45:52.921 --> 00:45:54.700
<v Speaker 1>in the early 1960s and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

783
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:55.710
<v Speaker 1>hold on a minute.</v>

784
00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:58.050
<v Speaker 1>We're not just stimulus response</v>
<v Speaker 1>machines,</v>

785
00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:01.050
<v Speaker 1>even though there are levels of analysis</v>
<v Speaker 1>at which we are.</v>

786
00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.110
<v Speaker 1>And then it wasn't until much later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 years later,</v>

787
00:46:04.111 --> 00:46:07.050
<v Speaker 1>really 30 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more a lot.</v>

788
00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:10.770
<v Speaker 1>As a consequence of the influence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian neuropsychologist as it turns</v>

789
00:46:10.771 --> 00:46:14.400
<v Speaker 1>out that it became self evident that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

790
00:46:14.401 --> 00:46:15.231
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

791
00:46:15.231 --> 00:46:17.040
<v Speaker 1>I cock cognition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

792
00:46:17.041 --> 00:46:22.041
<v Speaker 1>what about emotion and what about</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation and you know,</v>

793
00:46:22.231 --> 00:46:24.750
<v Speaker 1>can we actually study those as</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological properties?</v>

794
00:46:24.751 --> 00:46:27.210
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that turned out to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

795
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:29.940
<v Speaker 1>we certainly could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>

796
00:46:29.941 --> 00:46:34.941
<v Speaker 1>that it's obviously it's obvious that</v>
<v Speaker 1>our higher order cognitive functions are</v>

797
00:46:35.671 --> 00:46:39.480
<v Speaker 1>nested within fundamentally emotional</v>
<v Speaker 1>and motivational systems.</v>

798
00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:44.660
<v Speaker 1>And it's also obvious who's in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not the higher order cognitive</v>

799
00:46:45.211 --> 00:46:48.900
<v Speaker 1>functions unless you're blindly naive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

800
00:46:48.901 --> 00:46:53.040
<v Speaker 1>if even if you look at the brain from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroanatomical perspective,</v>

801
00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:58.080
<v Speaker 1>the strength of the projections reaching</v>
<v Speaker 1>up from the base of your brain,</v>

802
00:46:58.081 --> 00:47:02.040
<v Speaker 1>from places like the Hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the ground of fundamental</v>

803
00:47:02.041 --> 00:47:04.680
<v Speaker 1>motivational systems like aggression and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality,</v>

804
00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:09.450
<v Speaker 1>those are like tree trunks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little tendrils coming down from the</v>

805
00:47:09.451 --> 00:47:12.090
<v Speaker 1>top of your brain that the do the</v>
<v Speaker 1>regulation,</v>

806
00:47:12.091 --> 00:47:13.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conscious regulation,</v>

807
00:47:13.411 --> 00:47:15.000
<v Speaker 1>those are like little vines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

808
00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:19.290
<v Speaker 1>So as long as you're reasonably satiated</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything's under control,</v>

809
00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:22.350
<v Speaker 1>you can pretend that your rational mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>is running the show.</v>

810
00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:24.660
<v Speaker 1>But when push comes to shove,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

811
00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:26.250
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

812
00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:29.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's also pretty obvious that don't</v>

813
00:47:29.231 --> 00:47:32.860
<v Speaker 1>even really like it when your rational</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind is under control too much because,</v>

814
00:47:32.861 --> 00:47:37.120
<v Speaker 1>and this is again a reflection of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>super ego versus Eagle dichotomies.</v>

815
00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:38.920
<v Speaker 1>You're always running around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

816
00:47:38.921 --> 00:47:41.950
<v Speaker 1>consuming great amounts of alcohol and</v>
<v Speaker 1>other sorts of,</v>

817
00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:43.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

818
00:47:43.421 --> 00:47:47.950
<v Speaker 1>consciousness altering substances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which usually alternate for the worst so</v>

819
00:47:47.951 --> 00:47:50.180
<v Speaker 1>to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you can do impulsive and crazy</v>

820
00:47:50.181 --> 00:47:53.650
<v Speaker 1>and idiotic things that are really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really entertaining and fun.</v>

821
00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:57.400
<v Speaker 1>So we don't want to forget about who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>in charge.</v>

822
00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:03.420
<v Speaker 1>And Freud was and still is a very good</v>
<v Speaker 1>corrective for people who are convinced</v>

823
00:48:05.381 --> 00:48:10.381
<v Speaker 1>that they're rational intellect is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental element of there being.</v>

824
00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Now the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

825
00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:17.230
<v Speaker 1>the creation of illness that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Jones talked about and it unreal</v>

826
00:48:17.231 --> 00:48:22.231
<v Speaker 1>version I talked about is a variant of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the initiation process that we've been</v>

827
00:48:22.421 --> 00:48:24.490
<v Speaker 1>describing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that,</v>

828
00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:29.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like Annenberg Jay pointed out is</v>

829
00:48:30.341 --> 00:48:34.120
<v Speaker 1>that it's often the case that people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>make great discoveries go through a</v>

830
00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:37.240
<v Speaker 1>protracted period of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

831
00:48:37.241 --> 00:48:40.390
<v Speaker 1>they're making their discoveries before</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put the discoveries together.</v>

832
00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:44.140
<v Speaker 1>And that happened to Darwin for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

833
00:48:44.141 --> 00:48:47.050
<v Speaker 1>because Darwin knew perfectly well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

834
00:48:47.051 --> 00:48:49.270
<v Speaker 1>he's a pretty straight laced Englishman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole Darwin.</v>

835
00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:51.540
<v Speaker 1>He knew perfectly well that he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>lighting a bomb.</v>

836
00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:52.810
<v Speaker 1>It was a big bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

837
00:48:52.811 --> 00:48:57.760
<v Speaker 1>I think you could safely say that Darwin</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the most revolutionary scientist who</v>

838
00:48:57.900 --> 00:48:59.560
<v Speaker 1>ever lived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

839
00:48:59.561 --> 00:49:01.540
<v Speaker 1>when I was growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seemed to be Einstein,</v>

840
00:49:01.541 --> 00:49:03.880
<v Speaker 1>but the old Darwin man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

841
00:49:03.881 --> 00:49:06.220
<v Speaker 1>he's making a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's making his move.</v>

842
00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:10.030
<v Speaker 1>And it's especially the case because</v>
<v Speaker 1>Darwin not only outlined natural</v>

843
00:49:10.031 --> 00:49:11.080
<v Speaker 1>selection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

844
00:49:11.081 --> 00:49:13.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kept biologists busy for a whole hundred</v>

845
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:15.640
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he also outlined sexual selection</v>

846
00:49:15.641 --> 00:49:18.100
<v Speaker 1>and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Biologists ignore that for a hundred</v>

847
00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:23.020
<v Speaker 1>years and they're coming back to it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was hard on old Darwin because he</v>

848
00:49:23.021 --> 00:49:26.950
<v Speaker 1>knew that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world was going to go from 8,000</v>

849
00:49:26.951 --> 00:49:31.951
<v Speaker 1>years old and created by God to God only</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows how long and the consequence of</v>

850
00:49:32.471 --> 00:49:36.610
<v Speaker 1>somewhat random biological processes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a major league shift in</v>

851
00:49:36.611 --> 00:49:38.080
<v Speaker 1>the old world view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

852
00:49:38.081 --> 00:49:41.080
<v Speaker 1>so to the degree that Darwin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Darwin,</v>

853
00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:44.950
<v Speaker 1>his personality was structured both</v>
<v Speaker 1>explicitly and implicitly by,</v>

854
00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:48.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Protestant religious presuppositions,</v>

855
00:49:48.311 --> 00:49:51.280
<v Speaker 1>which it was because in many ways he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a conventional person.</v>

856
00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:53.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was taking a mighty axe to the basic</v>

857
00:49:53.801 --> 00:49:56.770
<v Speaker 1>trunk of is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the thick trunk of his being.</v>

858
00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:58.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he suffered for that,</v>

859
00:49:58.541 --> 00:50:01.000
<v Speaker 1>he had anxiety disorders and it's no</v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody wonder,</v>

860
00:50:01.001 --> 00:50:01.834
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

861
00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:03.730
<v Speaker 1>if you were Darwin and you weren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous,</v>

862
00:50:03.731 --> 00:50:06.850
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have had any idea what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were launching on the world.</v>

863
00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:09.160
<v Speaker 1>It was a massive revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

864
00:50:09.161 --> 00:50:14.110
<v Speaker 1>in Freud's notion that we were deeply</v>
<v Speaker 1>embedded in our animal selves.</v>

865
00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Also was was the precursor to having</v>
<v Speaker 1>people start to comprehend themselves,</v>

866
00:50:18.941 --> 00:50:20.680
<v Speaker 1>not in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

867
00:50:20.681 --> 00:50:25.681
<v Speaker 1>the last hundred years of history or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last 500 years of history or maybe even</v>

868
00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:28.670
<v Speaker 1>the entire five years of recorded</v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

869
00:50:28.671 --> 00:50:33.671
<v Speaker 1>But the 7 million years since we've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>separated from our common ancestor with</v>

870
00:50:34.341 --> 00:50:39.341
<v Speaker 1>chimps and the 60 million years since we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were living in trees and the 220 million</v>

871
00:50:39.801 --> 00:50:44.801
<v Speaker 1>years since there were mammals and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>400 million years when our ancestors</v>

872
00:50:45.021 --> 00:50:49.040
<v Speaker 1>were basically lobsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a completely different way of</v>

873
00:50:49.041 --> 00:50:51.380
<v Speaker 1>thinking about the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like it's something that we haven't</v>

874
00:50:51.381 --> 00:50:54.530
<v Speaker 1>digested yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say for Freud was in the</v>

875
00:50:54.531 --> 00:50:57.680
<v Speaker 1>forefront of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the revolution that produced that</v>

876
00:50:57.681 --> 00:51:01.880
<v Speaker 1>transformation and thinking it was also</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard on Freud and that's what Jones is</v>

877
00:51:01.881 --> 00:51:02.510
<v Speaker 1>pointing out.</v>

878
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:06.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Freud was definitely an anti</v>

879
00:51:06.021 --> 00:51:09.170
<v Speaker 1>religious destroyer like nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

880
00:51:09.171 --> 00:51:11.780
<v Speaker 1>he was another announcer of the death of</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

881
00:51:12.050 --> 00:51:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Freud's idea about religion was that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a defense.</v>

882
00:51:14.751 --> 00:51:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Anxiety against death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

883
00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:19.700
<v Speaker 1>a defense mechanism against death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>

884
00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:21.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to the degree that you guys are</v>

885
00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:24.320
<v Speaker 1>being taught terror management theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

886
00:51:24.321 --> 00:51:27.740
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight and simple.</v>

887
00:51:27.741 --> 00:51:30.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terror management theory was developed</v>

888
00:51:30.081 --> 00:51:33.830
<v Speaker 1>by Ernest Becker and Ernest Becker was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalyst even though he was</v>

889
00:51:33.831 --> 00:51:38.750
<v Speaker 1>associate sociologist and he wrote the</v>
<v Speaker 1>denial of death in an attempt to update</v>

890
00:51:38.751 --> 00:51:43.340
<v Speaker 1>Friday and presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Freud is by no means dead.</v>

891
00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:46.490
<v Speaker 1>And the idea of the associations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

892
00:51:46.491 --> 00:51:49.670
<v Speaker 1>that people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's thinking is associational and</v>

893
00:51:49.671 --> 00:51:53.510
<v Speaker 1>that the associations are actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>linked together by emotional similarity.</v>

894
00:51:53.511 --> 00:51:54.291
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

895
00:51:54.291 --> 00:51:58.430
<v Speaker 1>the implicit attitudes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the implicit attitudes,</v>

896
00:51:58.431 --> 00:52:00.500
<v Speaker 1>research is predicated on that idea.</v>

897
00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:04.170
<v Speaker 1>They don't ever credit freud with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was Freud's initial discovery,</v>

898
00:52:04.171 --> 00:52:05.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he discovered that,</v>

899
00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:08.330
<v Speaker 1>that people's thoughts wondered in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

900
00:52:08.331 --> 00:52:09.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that you could,</v>

901
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:12.410
<v Speaker 1>you could see why they wondered if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>paid attention.</v>

902
00:52:12.411 --> 00:52:17.411
<v Speaker 1>You could track the underlying rationale</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the connection between sets of</v>

903
00:52:18.111 --> 00:52:21.920
<v Speaker 1>disparate ideas by paying close</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention and you could interpret them.</v>

904
00:52:21.921 --> 00:52:23.930
<v Speaker 1>And that's really what he did with Free</v>
<v Speaker 1>Association.</v>

905
00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:26.960
<v Speaker 1>And I know I would say that I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really think for,</v>

906
00:52:26.961 --> 00:52:30.890
<v Speaker 1>I discovered free association.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what he did is observed that</v>

907
00:52:30.891 --> 00:52:35.840
<v Speaker 1>many of his severely damaged clients who</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think would have had some variant of</v>

908
00:52:35.841 --> 00:52:38.630
<v Speaker 1>borderline personality disorder if we</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have seen them today.</v>

909
00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:42.440
<v Speaker 1>If you just let them talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would free associate.</v>

910
00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:45.590
<v Speaker 1>And what that was in some sense it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

911
00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:49.190
<v Speaker 1>it was the consequence of the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>their personalities had never really</v>

912
00:52:49.191 --> 00:52:50.060
<v Speaker 1>been organized.</v>

913
00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:52.160
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's because no one had ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>listened to them,</v>

914
00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:55.340
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can tell you as far as I can see</v>

915
00:52:55.341 --> 00:52:59.990
<v Speaker 1>that people organize their personalities</v>
<v Speaker 1>by talking and if you don't have someone</v>

916
00:52:59.991 --> 00:53:01.040
<v Speaker 1>to listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

917
00:53:01.041 --> 00:53:02.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got all these ideas rattling</v>

918
00:53:02.631 --> 00:53:07.070
<v Speaker 1>around in your head that are basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>rooted in emotion and they're not linked</v>

919
00:53:07.071 --> 00:53:09.980
<v Speaker 1>together by any coherent narrative and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not pruned.</v>

920
00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:12.170
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need other people to say,</v>

921
00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:15.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really stupid way of looking at</v>

922
00:53:15.021 --> 00:53:16.040
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

923
00:53:16.041 --> 00:53:17.360
<v Speaker 1>big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't have that,</v>

924
00:53:17.361 --> 00:53:19.820
<v Speaker 1>well then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you've got a reasonably</v>

925
00:53:19.821 --> 00:53:22.070
<v Speaker 1>creative mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to generate a whole massive</v>

926
00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:24.380
<v Speaker 1>counter productive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

927
00:53:24.381 --> 00:53:28.380
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but re but potentially founded ideas</v>

928
00:53:28.381 --> 00:53:30.870
<v Speaker 1>that you just can't call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

929
00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:33.930
<v Speaker 1>and Freud figured that out with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of free association.</v>

930
00:53:33.931 --> 00:53:37.260
<v Speaker 1>So we've let people come into his office</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he wouldn't really look at them.</v>

931
00:53:37.261 --> 00:53:38.910
<v Speaker 1>You just let them lie on the couch and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd say,</v>

932
00:53:38.911 --> 00:53:40.470
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just say whatever comes to mind.</v>

933
00:53:40.471 --> 00:53:45.150
<v Speaker 1>And they'd go wandering around on some</v>
<v Speaker 1>quasi random path.</v>

934
00:53:45.151 --> 00:53:49.950
<v Speaker 1>And Freud would note the connections</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the things they said and infer</v>

935
00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:54.180
<v Speaker 1>what the underlying structure was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what he was doing was this</v>

936
00:53:54.181 --> 00:53:55.590
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So look,</v>

937
00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:02.860
<v Speaker 1>if let's say you go see a movie and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>your friend says,</v>

938
00:54:02.861 --> 00:54:04.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the movie about?</v>

939
00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:07.870
<v Speaker 1>You don't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the first thing we saw where the</v>

940
00:54:07.871 --> 00:54:12.790
<v Speaker 1>credits and then no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you say to your friend all the</v>

941
00:54:12.791 --> 00:54:16.090
<v Speaker 1>credits and then you described every</v>
<v Speaker 1>single movement that all the characters</v>

942
00:54:16.091 --> 00:54:17.890
<v Speaker 1>make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including when they blink their eyes and</v>

943
00:54:17.891 --> 00:54:19.570
<v Speaker 1>how they move their arms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

944
00:54:19.571 --> 00:54:22.630
<v Speaker 1>you don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do something really weird and</v>

945
00:54:22.631 --> 00:54:25.570
<v Speaker 1>mysterious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is you take the movie and you</v>

946
00:54:25.571 --> 00:54:28.270
<v Speaker 1>break it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you boil it down to,</v>

947
00:54:28.271 --> 00:54:30.940
<v Speaker 1>it's just whatever that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

948
00:54:30.941 --> 00:54:32.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the important features of the</v>

949
00:54:32.141 --> 00:54:33.460
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you say that,</v>

950
00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:34.810
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's five minutes summary.</v>

951
00:54:34.811 --> 00:54:35.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

952
00:54:35.651 --> 00:54:38.080
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just listen to the five</v>
<v Speaker 1>minute summary instead of going into the</v>

953
00:54:38.081 --> 00:54:40.630
<v Speaker 1>damn movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the weird thing is is you can do</v>

954
00:54:40.631 --> 00:54:40.960
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

955
00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:41.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

956
00:54:41.921 --> 00:54:45.130
<v Speaker 1>you do it without even thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>how insanely complex it is.</v>

957
00:54:45.370 --> 00:54:47.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud was doing that with his clients.</v>

958
00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:52.480
<v Speaker 1>They'd come in there and like lay out</v>
<v Speaker 1>this massive kind of incoherent verbal</v>

959
00:54:52.481 --> 00:54:57.010
<v Speaker 1>chain and he listened and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he'd hint at them perhaps what it</v>

960
00:54:57.011 --> 00:55:00.790
<v Speaker 1>meant and he extract out the gist of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

961
00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:06.040
<v Speaker 1>And then if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the advantage to having your memory</v>

962
00:55:06.041 --> 00:55:09.790
<v Speaker 1>reduced to just is that you can only</v>
<v Speaker 1>only have to remember the important</v>

963
00:55:09.791 --> 00:55:11.800
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then all of the things that aren't</v>

964
00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:14.860
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can let go of,</v>

965
00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:17.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you see this happening.</v>

966
00:55:17.561 --> 00:55:19.450
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you ever have a fight with someone,</v>

967
00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:22.690
<v Speaker 1>especially someone that you love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how it happens all the time is</v>

968
00:55:22.691 --> 00:55:26.080
<v Speaker 1>you'll start fighting about something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's trivial and then both of you,</v>

969
00:55:26.081 --> 00:55:28.900
<v Speaker 1>we'll figure out what we're really not</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting about that at all.</v>

970
00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:30.490
<v Speaker 1>And then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

971
00:55:30.491 --> 00:55:34.960
<v Speaker 1>what are you fighting about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one answer to that is the person who</v>

972
00:55:34.961 --> 00:55:38.410
<v Speaker 1>was the irritating person who started</v>
<v Speaker 1>the argument provoked it say,</v>

973
00:55:38.411 --> 00:55:42.430
<v Speaker 1>because that happens might not even know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the world it is that they're</v>

974
00:55:42.490 --> 00:55:45.160
<v Speaker 1>irritated about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to kind of torture them to</v>

975
00:55:45.161 --> 00:55:50.161
<v Speaker 1>death for an hour before they can figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out what it was that drove the</v>

976
00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:55.540
<v Speaker 1>irritation and manifest it in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>articulated form.</v>

977
00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:57.393
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

978
00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:03.270
<v Speaker 1>in a sense that's bringing things up</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the depths of the unconscious,</v>

979
00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:04.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now Freud would have thought of those</v>

980
00:56:04.861 --> 00:56:06.300
<v Speaker 1>things as repressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

981
00:56:06.301 --> 00:56:08.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to talk about that with you</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I repressed it.</v>

982
00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:10.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't really think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often.</v>

983
00:56:10.711 --> 00:56:15.711
<v Speaker 1>I think what happens is that irritation</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself in vague moods and you</v>

984
00:56:17.101 --> 00:56:21.390
<v Speaker 1>have to investigate the mood and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion using different articulated</v>

985
00:56:21.391 --> 00:56:23.350
<v Speaker 1>frameworks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of what an argument is</v>

986
00:56:23.351 --> 00:56:27.310
<v Speaker 1>about until you stumble across the</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual articulation,</v>

987
00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:29.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you're being tortured by your</v>

988
00:56:29.711 --> 00:56:33.370
<v Speaker 1>partner for one reason or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's because for the 50th time you</v>

989
00:56:33.371 --> 00:56:36.820
<v Speaker 1>left the dish rag on the counter or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and after fighting with them</v>

990
00:56:36.821 --> 00:56:38.410
<v Speaker 1>for an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you figure out that they had a really</v>

991
00:56:38.411 --> 00:56:42.100
<v Speaker 1>bad day at work for reasons that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't really notice and don't want to</v>

992
00:56:42.101 --> 00:56:42.934
<v Speaker 1>talk about.</v>

993
00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:46.750
<v Speaker 1>So that's Friday and psychoanalysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you guys are,</v>

994
00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:49.510
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that you're sophisticated</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicators,</v>

995
00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:51.850
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be doing that all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

996
00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:53.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of you actually believe that</v>

997
00:56:53.801 --> 00:56:57.640
<v Speaker 1>everything a person says is what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean or that they have perfectly</v>

998
00:56:57.641 --> 00:57:01.570
<v Speaker 1>transparent self knowledge?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think no one believes that anymore.</v>

999
00:57:02.410 --> 00:57:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do believe that well yet hadn't</v>

1000
00:57:05.771 --> 00:57:08.280
<v Speaker 1>been paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that's really the,</v>

1001
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:12.880
<v Speaker 1>the bottom line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these creative illnesses are a</v>

1002
00:57:12.881 --> 00:57:16.930
<v Speaker 1>consequence of this descent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And rebirth process that we talked about</v>

1003
00:57:16.931 --> 00:57:19.210
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's much more likely to happen.</v>

1004
00:57:19.211 --> 00:57:21.970
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I marked revolutionary at the top.</v>

1005
00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:23.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

1006
00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:26.230
<v Speaker 1>when you're a genius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you blow apart the basic presuppositions</v>

1007
00:57:26.231 --> 00:57:29.440
<v Speaker 1>of an entire culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to the degree that your personality</v>

1008
00:57:29.441 --> 00:57:33.940
<v Speaker 1>is predicated on those assumptions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even your place in the world,</v>

1009
00:57:34.210 --> 00:57:36.760
<v Speaker 1>when you chop that over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you fall too.</v>

1010
00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:40.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the whole idea that Darwin had that,</v>

1011
00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:46.030
<v Speaker 1>that the environment itself could modify</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological forms through selection.</v>

1012
00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:47.860
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a brilliant idea because,</v>

1013
00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:50.380
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it precisely because it accounts</v>

1014
00:57:50.381 --> 00:57:55.381
<v Speaker 1>for why complex forms can emerge in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>absence of an intelligent designer.</v>

1015
00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:57.093
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1016
00:57:57.550 --> 00:58:00.940
<v Speaker 1>no doubt there are holes in Darwinian</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>

1017
00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:03.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many of you know this,</v>

1018
00:58:03.161 --> 00:58:06.700
<v Speaker 1>but there's a whole new field of science</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's popped up really in the 21st</v>

1019
00:58:06.701 --> 00:58:11.701
<v Speaker 1>century called epogen epigenetics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that you can lamarck who</v>

1020
00:58:12.041 --> 00:58:14.820
<v Speaker 1>was really the prime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1021
00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:18.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what adversary in some sense of Darwin,</v>

1022
00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:22.930
<v Speaker 1>dark lamarck believed you could inherit</v>
<v Speaker 1>an acquired characteristics,</v>

1023
00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:24.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For a straight Darwinians like no,</v>

1024
00:58:24.941 --> 00:58:28.060
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of evidence now that you</v>

1025
00:58:28.061 --> 00:58:32.650
<v Speaker 1>can acquire in here that you can inherit</v>
<v Speaker 1>an acquired characteristic.</v>

1026
00:58:32.651 --> 00:58:35.440
<v Speaker 1>So they've showed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example with rats that if you</v>

1027
00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:40.680
<v Speaker 1>produce a certain amount of terror laden</v>
<v Speaker 1>phobia in a rat,</v>

1028
00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:45.700
<v Speaker 1>the rat pups three generations down are</v>
<v Speaker 1>still predisposed in that manner.</v>

1029
00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:47.760
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just scratched the surface of Epi</v>

1030
00:58:47.761 --> 00:58:50.560
<v Speaker 1>genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that your experience can</v>

1031
00:58:50.561 --> 00:58:53.680
<v Speaker 1>alter the structure of your DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does that by a process,</v>

1032
00:58:53.681 --> 00:58:56.150
<v Speaker 1>which I don't understand called</v>
<v Speaker 1>methylation.</v>

1033
00:58:56.151 --> 00:59:00.670
<v Speaker 1>And methylation apparently is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>modification of the DNA structure by</v>

1034
00:59:00.671 --> 00:59:03.330
<v Speaker 1>additions of little clumps of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1035
00:59:03.350 --> 00:59:07.180
<v Speaker 1>little chemical units,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little molecules to some in some way we</v>

1036
00:59:07.181 --> 00:59:11.080
<v Speaker 1>don't get that encodes actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>environmentally relevant information.</v>

1037
00:59:11.110 --> 00:59:14.440
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty mind boggling.</v>

1038
00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:19.620
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my point is the final word on how we</v>

1039
00:59:19.781 --> 00:59:20.920
<v Speaker 1>evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not yet,</v>

1040
00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:25.640
<v Speaker 1>but Darwin popped up this idea that</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you didn't need an intelligent</v>

1041
00:59:25.641 --> 00:59:26.870
<v Speaker 1>designer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1042
00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:28.170
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1043
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:32.960
<v Speaker 1>it's a big problem for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a world whose primary notion before</v>

1044
00:59:32.961 --> 00:59:36.380
<v Speaker 1>then was that everything was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>creation of something that was not only</v>

1045
00:59:36.381 --> 00:59:39.830
<v Speaker 1>intelligent but benevolent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was a little hard on people to come</v>

1046
00:59:39.831 --> 00:59:43.070
<v Speaker 1>up with those ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's no reason at all for them</v>

1047
00:59:43.071 --> 00:59:46.130
<v Speaker 1>not to think that they're completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>insane when it first happens because</v>

1048
00:59:46.131 --> 00:59:50.480
<v Speaker 1>they think something that's really deep</v>
<v Speaker 1>and revolutionary that no one else</v>

1049
00:59:50.481 --> 00:59:54.860
<v Speaker 1>thinks or has thought up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the probability that you've done</v>

1050
00:59:54.861 --> 00:59:57.230
<v Speaker 1>that instead of just going stark raving</v>
<v Speaker 1>mad,</v>

1051
00:59:57.231 --> 00:59:58.520
<v Speaker 1>it's like zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1052
00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:03.200
<v Speaker 1>So for every actual genius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there must be 10,000 people who are</v>

1053
01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:05.900
<v Speaker 1>convinced in some bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manic,</v>

1054
01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:08.690
<v Speaker 1>paranoid manner that they are genius and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not.</v>

1055
01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:12.470
<v Speaker 1>So it's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud was also</v>

1056
01:00:15.590 --> 01:00:20.450
<v Speaker 1>one of the first people to really go</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the idea that we could represent</v>

1057
01:00:20.451 --> 01:00:25.451
<v Speaker 1>ideas in symbolic form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a manner that was in fact</v>

1058
01:00:25.701 --> 01:00:29.720
<v Speaker 1>representational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that we ourselves didn't understand.</v>

1059
01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:30.981
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1060
01:00:30.981 --> 01:00:33.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another revolutionary idea,</v>

1061
01:00:33.891 --> 01:00:35.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that we could express that it was</v>

1062
01:00:35.901 --> 01:00:39.230
<v Speaker 1>possible to express concepts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially those that were associated</v>

1063
01:00:39.231 --> 01:00:44.231
<v Speaker 1>with emotion and motivation using non</v>
<v Speaker 1>linguistic representations that needed</v>

1064
01:00:45.711 --> 01:00:47.570
<v Speaker 1>to be deciphered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1065
01:00:47.571 --> 01:00:51.470
<v Speaker 1>Freud's initial theory about that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the reason that happened was</v>

1066
01:00:51.471 --> 01:00:53.300
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where I think he got</v>

1067
01:00:53.301 --> 01:00:55.130
<v Speaker 1>something seriously wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever,</v>

1068
01:00:55.131 --> 01:00:55.964
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>

1069
01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:57.023
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1070
01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:03.100
<v Speaker 1>you have to say that with respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud appeared to think of memory in a</v>

1071
01:01:03.231 --> 01:01:05.090
<v Speaker 1>way that we wouldn't think of memory</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1072
01:01:05.091 --> 01:01:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Like he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he seemed to think something like</v>

1073
01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:12.290
<v Speaker 1>when you made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you experienced an event,</v>

1074
01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:16.740
<v Speaker 1>the event was as the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few experienced it,</v>

1075
01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:20.430
<v Speaker 1>that that was the event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you experienced was the reality</v>

1076
01:01:20.431 --> 01:01:23.520
<v Speaker 1>of the event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then sometimes you didn't like the</v>

1077
01:01:23.521 --> 01:01:27.270
<v Speaker 1>implication of that event or perhaps you</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't understand it,</v>

1078
01:01:27.271 --> 01:01:29.550
<v Speaker 1>but you could understand it enough to</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that it was horrible.</v>

1079
01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:30.930
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be a traumatic event.</v>

1080
01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:34.920
<v Speaker 1>And then just shove that sucker down</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the depths of your being where,</v>

1081
01:01:35.830 --> 01:01:37.500
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he didn't have to think about it</v>

1082
01:01:37.501 --> 01:01:42.501
<v Speaker 1>anymore and then it would poke itself up</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the nether regions of your</v>

1083
01:01:43.111 --> 01:01:45.390
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Partly in dreams,</v>

1084
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:48.930
<v Speaker 1>partly and interestingly enough in slips</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the tongue,</v>

1085
01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:51.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we still call those Friday and slips and</v>

1086
01:01:51.151 --> 01:01:54.540
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you one of the things that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really cool about doing dream analysis</v>

1087
01:01:54.541 --> 01:01:58.650
<v Speaker 1>and psychotherapy is that people make</v>
<v Speaker 1>slips of the tongue tongue all the time.</v>

1088
01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Tom May slips of the tongue.</v>

1089
01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:03.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I won't interpret that for now.</v>

1090
01:02:04.050 --> 01:02:07.710
<v Speaker 1>But if you listen to people make Friday</v>
<v Speaker 1>and slips while they're talking to you</v>

1091
01:02:07.711 --> 01:02:10.620
<v Speaker 1>about their dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're often telling you exactly what</v>

1092
01:02:10.621 --> 01:02:12.420
<v Speaker 1>the dream means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's so cool.</v>

1093
01:02:12.421 --> 01:02:15.030
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how words can have two</v>

1094
01:02:15.031 --> 01:02:15.864
<v Speaker 1>meanings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1095
01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:20.460
<v Speaker 1>Or sometimes three meetings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes someone is telling you about</v>

1096
01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:24.000
<v Speaker 1>their dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll use a sentence to describe part</v>

1097
01:02:24.001 --> 01:02:27.900
<v Speaker 1>of the dream that similar caneously</v>
<v Speaker 1>accounts for the other part of the dream</v>

1098
01:02:27.901 --> 01:02:29.490
<v Speaker 1>without them even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notice it.</v>

1099
01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:32.430
<v Speaker 1>And then all I'll do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause we're trying to puzzle out the</v>

1100
01:02:32.431 --> 01:02:35.280
<v Speaker 1>dream is all tell them back what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>just said.</v>

1101
01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.860
<v Speaker 1>And they'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1102
01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:38.370
<v Speaker 1>they'll have a little startle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1103
01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's obviously what that means.</v>

1104
01:02:40.531 --> 01:02:43.410
<v Speaker 1>And how in the world people are smart</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to do that.</v>

1105
01:02:43.411 --> 01:02:45.120
<v Speaker 1>On the fly is beyond me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1106
01:02:45.121 --> 01:02:47.040
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard enough to talk about one thing</v>

1107
01:02:47.310 --> 01:02:48.143
<v Speaker 1>at a time.</v>

1108
01:02:48.210 --> 01:02:51.780
<v Speaker 1>But to manage to talk about two things</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the same sentence in a coherent</v>

1109
01:02:51.781 --> 01:02:54.360
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like wait to go brain.</v>

1110
01:02:54.690 --> 01:02:57.180
<v Speaker 1>And I think what's happening is we kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of know that,</v>

1111
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:59.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left hemisphere,</v>

1112
01:02:59.191 --> 01:03:01.830
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking is a linguistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere,</v>

1113
01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:05.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a corresponding area in the</v>

1114
01:03:05.821 --> 01:03:10.590
<v Speaker 1>right hemisphere that's more or less in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same physiological location that</v>

1115
01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:14.750
<v Speaker 1>this part inhibits tonically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1116
01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:17.730
<v Speaker 1>it inhibits it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it kind of seems that what happens</v>

1117
01:03:17.731 --> 01:03:21.480
<v Speaker 1>is now and then that other part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain can get access to speech.</v>

1118
01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Now it's not very linguistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it sort of stumbles around and maybe</v>

1119
01:03:24.511 --> 01:03:28.800
<v Speaker 1>it does it in more symbolic terms cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>it thinks it logistically but now and</v>

1120
01:03:28.801 --> 01:03:31.260
<v Speaker 1>then it's got something to say and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poof,</v>

1121
01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:33.450
<v Speaker 1>both of them are talking at the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1122
01:03:33.451 --> 01:03:34.710
<v Speaker 1>And that is the coolest thing.</v>

1123
01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Like the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

1124
01:03:36.271 --> 01:03:37.680
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1125
01:03:37.681 --> 01:03:39.330
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the problems with</v>

1126
01:03:39.331 --> 01:03:44.130
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic phenomena is that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't really understand them in the</v>

1127
01:03:44.131 --> 01:03:48.960
<v Speaker 1>absence of the context that a lengthy</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapeutic interaction provides.</v>

1128
01:03:48.961 --> 01:03:49.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1129
01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:51.840
<v Speaker 1>you know how if it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have an old friend,</v>

1130
01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:54.690
<v Speaker 1>he's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just say the number of a joke.</v>

1131
01:03:54.691 --> 01:03:56.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's joke 42 and they'll</v>

1132
01:03:56.590 --> 01:03:58.530
<v Speaker 1>laugh because they know the joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1133
01:03:58.531 --> 01:04:03.531
<v Speaker 1>you have this shared history that</v>
<v Speaker 1>enables you to make reference to things</v>

1134
01:04:03.661 --> 01:04:08.340
<v Speaker 1>just using fragments and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>explain how you do that to someone else</v>

1135
01:04:08.341 --> 01:04:09.960
<v Speaker 1>while at the same thing happens in</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy.</v>

1136
01:04:09.961 --> 01:04:13.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like you've talked to this person</v>
<v Speaker 1>for endless hours about the most</v>

1137
01:04:13.381 --> 01:04:15.180
<v Speaker 1>important things that are going on in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their life.</v>

1138
01:04:15.181 --> 01:04:19.290
<v Speaker 1>And then there'll be communication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicated phenomena that emerge</v>

1139
01:04:19.291 --> 01:04:20.910
<v Speaker 1>within that context.</v>

1140
01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:22.440
<v Speaker 1>And they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1141
01:04:22.441 --> 01:04:24.540
<v Speaker 1>they strike you with the force of</v>
<v Speaker 1>revelation,</v>

1142
01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:28.530
<v Speaker 1>but you can't communicate them to anyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>else cause you can't conjure up the</v>

1143
01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:31.020
<v Speaker 1>entire context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is partly why I want to show you</v>

1144
01:04:31.021 --> 01:04:35.550
<v Speaker 1>this movie on Tuesday because it's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>only thing I've ever seen that actually</v>

1145
01:04:35.551 --> 01:04:37.050
<v Speaker 1>manages to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1146
01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:41.250
<v Speaker 1>it shows Freudian psychopathology</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it gives you enough contextual</v>

1147
01:04:41.251 --> 01:04:43.860
<v Speaker 1>information to actually infer it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1148
01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:47.670
<v Speaker 1>so that's really smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that whole free association thing,</v>

1149
01:04:47.671 --> 01:04:51.570
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's his idea that it was emotional</v>

1150
01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:55.020
<v Speaker 1>systems repressed or not part of the Ed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not.</v>

1151
01:04:55.021 --> 01:04:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Because his idea of the unconscious was</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat,</v>

1152
01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:01.920
<v Speaker 1>it was somewhat confused in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depended on when he was thinking</v>

1153
01:05:01.921 --> 01:05:02.461
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1154
01:05:02.461 --> 01:05:04.500
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unconscious was a place to put</v>

1155
01:05:04.501 --> 01:05:06.150
<v Speaker 1>things you didn't want to pay any</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to.</v>

1156
01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:10.620
<v Speaker 1>But then later it sort of became the Ed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Ed was the place of these</v>

1157
01:05:10.621 --> 01:05:12.990
<v Speaker 1>primordial drives and emotions.</v>

1158
01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:15.720
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not a bad model of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious,</v>

1159
01:05:15.721 --> 01:05:17.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you think about it as</v>

1160
01:05:17.501 --> 01:05:20.170
<v Speaker 1>something alive and the unconscious is</v>
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

1161
01:05:20.171 --> 01:05:22.210
<v Speaker 1>It is not a cognitive machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1162
01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:25.000
<v Speaker 1>modern psychologists talk about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive unconscious.</v>

1163
01:05:25.001 --> 01:05:25.571
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1164
01:05:25.571 --> 01:05:26.890
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1165
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:28.810
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a cognitive unconscious.</v>

1166
01:05:28.811 --> 01:05:29.261
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1167
01:05:29.261 --> 01:05:31.330
<v Speaker 1>what about the rest of them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1168
01:05:31.331 --> 01:05:35.500
<v Speaker 1>the motivational unconscious and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional unconscious and those things</v>

1169
01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:38.950
<v Speaker 1>to the effect of neuroscientists are</v>
<v Speaker 1>onto that anyway.</v>

1170
01:05:38.951 --> 01:05:40.810
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1171
01:05:40.811 --> 01:05:43.360
<v Speaker 1>Freud got there way early and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would,</v>

1172
01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:46.540
<v Speaker 1>he would note that you see this all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1173
01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.430
<v Speaker 1>you're talking to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're mad at you,</v>

1174
01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you say,</v>

1175
01:05:50.381 --> 01:05:51.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're mad at me.</v>

1176
01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:51.881
<v Speaker 1>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1177
01:05:51.881 --> 01:05:52.714
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

1178
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:55.900
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they face makes it perfectly evident</v>

1179
01:05:55.901 --> 01:05:56.734
<v Speaker 1>that they're mad at you.</v>

1180
01:05:56.830 --> 01:05:59.260
<v Speaker 1>And so does their tone of voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1181
01:05:59.261 --> 01:06:01.840
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they lying?</v>

1182
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:06.970
<v Speaker 1>Are they repressing or are they just</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than one thing at the same time?</v>

1183
01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:08.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1184
01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:11.080
<v Speaker 1>each of those ideas is a perfectly good</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>

1185
01:06:11.110 --> 01:06:16.110
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly clear that the thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're facing is by no means a unified</v>

1186
01:06:16.331 --> 01:06:17.470
<v Speaker 1>phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

1187
01:06:17.471 --> 01:06:18.221
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're mad at me.</v>

1188
01:06:18.221 --> 01:06:18.671
<v Speaker 1>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1189
01:06:18.671 --> 01:06:19.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1190
01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:21.730
<v Speaker 1>sure you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1191
01:06:21.731 --> 01:06:24.790
<v Speaker 1>and if you poke and prod them in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>irritate them and get them to talk</v>

1192
01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:29.290
<v Speaker 1>eventually they'll probably figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>why they're mad because maybe they don't</v>

1193
01:06:29.291 --> 01:06:32.230
<v Speaker 1>know or they weren't willing to admit it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to themselves or they hadn't fully</v>

1194
01:06:32.231 --> 01:06:35.650
<v Speaker 1>articulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe they'll tell you.</v>

1195
01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Usually they'll cry first and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell you,</v>

1196
01:06:38.530 --> 01:06:39.490
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how it is,</v>

1197
01:06:39.491 --> 01:06:41.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you watch how these things progress,</v>

1198
01:06:42.430 --> 01:06:46.120
<v Speaker 1>it's like it isn't until something</v>
<v Speaker 1>collapses in some sense in the person</v>

1199
01:06:46.121 --> 01:06:48.280
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they sort of soften,</v>

1200
01:06:48.430 --> 01:06:52.570
<v Speaker 1>I guess they let their persona drop or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that until they soften,</v>

1201
01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:54.580
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to tell you what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

1202
01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:56.830
<v Speaker 1>So there defendant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1203
01:06:56.831 --> 01:07:00.820
<v Speaker 1>and that's another freud in idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You defend yourself against certain</v>

1204
01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Sinamatella and certain truths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1205
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:05.710
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you certainly do that.</v>

1206
01:07:05.711 --> 01:07:06.910
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do it about,</v>

1207
01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:12.100
<v Speaker 1>you pretend that other people are other</v>
<v Speaker 1>than you know them to be.</v>

1208
01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:15.250
<v Speaker 1>People do that all the time when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were in a relationship that they should</v>

1209
01:07:15.251 --> 01:07:18.100
<v Speaker 1>have ended like a year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they had any sense at all.</v>

1210
01:07:18.101 --> 01:07:19.390
<v Speaker 1>And they know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

1211
01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:21.940
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know this is going to work out.</v>

1212
01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:25.510
<v Speaker 1>And they use that stupid voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that you're only talking</v>

1213
01:07:25.511 --> 01:07:26.261
<v Speaker 1>from here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1214
01:07:26.261 --> 01:07:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Cause they're ignoring the entire rest</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their body and what it's saying,</v>

1215
01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:31.600
<v Speaker 1>they know perfectly well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's absolute rubbish.</v>

1216
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:34.390
<v Speaker 1>They have no way of explaining to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>why they're doing it.</v>

1217
01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:36.550
<v Speaker 1>They don't know themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

1218
01:07:38.650 --> 01:07:41.650
<v Speaker 1>Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knew what he was talking about.</v>

1219
01:07:42.190 --> 01:07:44.710
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you observe in your own behavior,</v>

1220
01:07:44.711 --> 01:07:48.550
<v Speaker 1>your proclivity to do absolutely absurd</v>
<v Speaker 1>and self destructive things at the drop</v>

1221
01:07:48.551 --> 01:07:51.610
<v Speaker 1>of a hat and be entirely unable to</v>
<v Speaker 1>control it.</v>

1222
01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:53.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we talked a little bit about</v>

1223
01:07:53.801 --> 01:07:57.280
<v Speaker 1>eating disorders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's like 80 or 90 of you</v>

1224
01:07:57.281 --> 01:08:00.580
<v Speaker 1>in this room that means at least 30 of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have an eating disorder.</v>

1225
01:08:00.730 --> 01:08:04.060
<v Speaker 1>So you're like having this horrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>battle with your hypothalamus for all</v>

1226
01:08:04.061 --> 01:08:06.040
<v Speaker 1>sorts of weird reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1227
01:08:06.041 --> 01:08:10.540
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of the modern equivalent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud and sexual psychopathology because</v>

1228
01:08:10.810 --> 01:08:12.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can sleep around but we don't know</v>

1229
01:08:12.731 --> 01:08:15.260
<v Speaker 1>how to eat anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know if that's much of an</v>

1230
01:08:15.261 --> 01:08:17.660
<v Speaker 1>improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is Freud.</v>

1231
01:08:17.661 --> 01:08:20.180
<v Speaker 1>The mind is a composite of contradictory</v>
<v Speaker 1>drives.</v>

1232
01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:22.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Freud actually wasn't,</v>

1233
01:08:23.150 --> 01:08:26.660
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't really a drive theorist cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was more sophisticated than that,</v>

1234
01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:29.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because really when he talks about</v>

1235
01:08:29.121 --> 01:08:32.270
<v Speaker 1>drives in the broader context of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>

1236
01:08:32.271 --> 01:08:36.590
<v Speaker 1>it's clear that he's talking more about</v>
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities because these drives</v>

1237
01:08:36.591 --> 01:08:40.610
<v Speaker 1>manifest themselves as living entities</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their own emotional systems,</v>

1238
01:08:40.611 --> 01:08:42.380
<v Speaker 1>their own thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own impulses,</v>

1239
01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:44.300
<v Speaker 1>even their own ability to speak.</v>

1240
01:08:44.690 --> 01:08:47.120
<v Speaker 1>And you know that's true because now and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you say something when you're</v>

1241
01:08:47.121 --> 01:08:48.350
<v Speaker 1>angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

1242
01:08:48.410 --> 01:08:51.500
<v Speaker 1>well I wish I wouldn't have said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like who's doing the wishing there?</v>

1243
01:08:51.501 --> 01:08:53.270
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1244
01:08:53.271 --> 01:08:56.960
<v Speaker 1>it's like it wasn't you that said it</v>
<v Speaker 1>while he said it was because I was</v>

1245
01:08:56.961 --> 01:09:00.770
<v Speaker 1>angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that means you're not your anger.</v>

1246
01:09:00.771 --> 01:09:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Well that's Freud's point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ego Id ID is anger.</v>

1247
01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:09.200
<v Speaker 1>It is the thing that bubbles up all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these impulsive actions and statements</v>

1248
01:09:09.201 --> 01:09:12.530
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to detach yourself from</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sucker as soon as you can and</v>

1249
01:09:12.531 --> 01:09:14.300
<v Speaker 1>you're going to expect people to forgive</v>
<v Speaker 1>you for it.</v>

1250
01:09:14.301 --> 01:09:16.910
<v Speaker 1>Like I wouldn't have said that if he</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have made me so angry.</v>

1251
01:09:17.330 --> 01:09:19.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like the worst kind of apology,</v>

1252
01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:21.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1253
01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:25.040
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did something rude to you because</v>

1254
01:09:25.041 --> 01:09:28.220
<v Speaker 1>you're a horrible and I'm your victim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's a great apology.</v>

1255
01:09:28.790 --> 01:09:33.750
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>frightened was also pretty damn</v>

1256
01:09:33.751 --> 01:09:36.620
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated in his approach to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>

1257
01:09:36.621 --> 01:09:39.290
<v Speaker 1>So here's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's some functions that he had</v>

1258
01:09:39.291 --> 01:09:43.850
<v Speaker 1>identified as early as the 19 hundreds</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he said the unconscious has a</v>

1259
01:09:43.851 --> 01:09:48.080
<v Speaker 1>conservative faculty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It stores memories often unaccessible to</v>

1260
01:09:48.081 --> 01:09:49.790
<v Speaker 1>voluntary recall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1261
01:09:50.030 --> 01:09:51.380
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1262
01:09:51.381 --> 01:09:54.890
<v Speaker 1>So where are those things that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember that you could remember but</v>

1263
01:09:54.891 --> 01:09:56.930
<v Speaker 1>that you aren't?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1264
01:09:56.931 --> 01:09:57.920
<v Speaker 1>that's a hard one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1265
01:09:57.921 --> 01:09:58.754
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1266
01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:01.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they seem to be somewhere when I</v>

1267
01:10:01.671 --> 01:10:03.200
<v Speaker 1>want to recall them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Freud would say,</v>

1268
01:10:03.201 --> 01:10:05.300
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in the unconscious now.</v>

1269
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:09.440
<v Speaker 1>It's obviously a black box hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1270
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not very explanatory.</v>

1271
01:10:11.751 --> 01:10:15.050
<v Speaker 1>But at least he had the sense that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was reasonable to think of them as</v>

1272
01:10:15.051 --> 01:10:19.610
<v Speaker 1>somewhere dissolute IV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The unconscious contains habits once</v>

1273
01:10:19.611 --> 01:10:23.720
<v Speaker 1>voluntary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now automatized and dissociated elements</v>

1274
01:10:23.721 --> 01:10:26.240
<v Speaker 1>of the personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which may lead a parasitic existence.</v>

1275
01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:28.040
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's smart.</v>

1276
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:31.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that that if you did something</v>

1277
01:10:31.881 --> 01:10:36.740
<v Speaker 1>habitually that that would produce an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an automatized system.</v>

1278
01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:38.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't get there with,</v>

1279
01:10:38.781 --> 01:10:41.480
<v Speaker 1>with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with neuroscience until maybe the last</v>

1280
01:10:41.481 --> 01:10:43.940
<v Speaker 1>20 years when we actually figured out</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is what happens.</v>

1281
01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:45.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you first start doing something,</v>

1282
01:10:46.030 --> 01:10:48.980
<v Speaker 1>if it's complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your whole brain is involved in that.</v>

1283
01:10:48.981 --> 01:10:51.770
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's so exhausting because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really not good at it,</v>

1284
01:10:51.771 --> 01:10:53.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're stumbling around like you're</v>

1285
01:10:53.181 --> 01:10:55.340
<v Speaker 1>trying to learn a piano piece for</v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

1286
01:10:55.341 --> 01:10:57.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make mistakes and you're just a</v>

1287
01:10:57.261 --> 01:11:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Klutz at it and then you practice and</v>
<v Speaker 1>practice and practice.</v>

1288
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:03.830
<v Speaker 1>And as you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less and less of your brain is involved,</v>

1289
01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:08.600
<v Speaker 1>interestingly enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the parts that are active move from</v>

1290
01:11:08.601 --> 01:11:12.740
<v Speaker 1>the right to the left and then they move</v>
<v Speaker 1>back and as they move back,</v>

1291
01:11:12.741 --> 01:11:16.560
<v Speaker 1>they get smaller and smaller and smaller</v>
<v Speaker 1>until you have a little habit machine</v>

1292
01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:18.870
<v Speaker 1>that enables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say to play that piece of piano</v>

1293
01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:22.530
<v Speaker 1>music or that is really good at biking</v>
<v Speaker 1>cocaine,</v>

1294
01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:24.600
<v Speaker 1>depending on what you've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>practicing,</v>

1295
01:11:24.601 --> 01:11:26.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that's a little monster in your</v>

1296
01:11:26.551 --> 01:11:26.850
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

1297
01:11:26.850 --> 01:11:30.540
<v Speaker 1>Especially if it's associated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like cocaine and good luck</v>

1298
01:11:30.541 --> 01:11:33.250
<v Speaker 1>getting rid of that because if you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>taught,</v>

1299
01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:36.960
<v Speaker 1>you've automated it and built it into</v>
<v Speaker 1>your biology and Freud would say,</v>

1300
01:11:36.961 --> 01:11:39.150
<v Speaker 1>well then the thing just runs as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>autonomous unit.</v>

1301
01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:39.751
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1302
01:11:39.751 --> 01:11:40.860
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The nailed.</v>

1303
01:11:40.861 --> 01:11:43.200
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Creative.</v>

1304
01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:46.860
<v Speaker 1>The unconscious serves as the Matrix of</v>
<v Speaker 1>new ideas.</v>

1305
01:11:47.490 --> 01:11:49.260
<v Speaker 1>That's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's smart.</v>

1306
01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:51.330
<v Speaker 1>Often when you're coming up with new</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>

1307
01:11:51.331 --> 01:11:54.450
<v Speaker 1>you actually free associate as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People call that brainstorming.</v>

1308
01:11:54.451 --> 01:11:55.680
<v Speaker 1>So good work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud,</v>

1309
01:11:55.681 --> 01:11:57.990
<v Speaker 1>that was real smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mytho poetic.</v>

1310
01:11:58.410 --> 01:12:01.830
<v Speaker 1>The unconscious constructs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>narratives and fantasies that appeared</v>

1311
01:12:01.831 --> 01:12:03.810
<v Speaker 1>mythic are religious in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1312
01:12:03.811 --> 01:12:05.760
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young took that and just ran with it.</v>

1313
01:12:05.761 --> 01:12:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Freud never quite made the</v>

1314
01:12:08.101 --> 01:12:09.540
<v Speaker 1>connection there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately,</v>

1315
01:12:09.541 --> 01:12:12.900
<v Speaker 1>because he was so interested in</v>
<v Speaker 1>hammering home the point that human</v>

1316
01:12:12.901 --> 01:12:17.901
<v Speaker 1>beings were biological creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never really was able to grapple with</v>

1317
01:12:18.001 --> 01:12:19.170
<v Speaker 1>the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1318
01:12:19.171 --> 01:12:20.670
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're biological creatures,</v>

1319
01:12:20.671 --> 01:12:24.150
<v Speaker 1>but the mythic poetic function is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological function,</v>

1320
01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:26.910
<v Speaker 1>and so to say that religion is only a</v>
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

1321
01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:30.000
<v Speaker 1>a defense against death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety is actually,</v>

1322
01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:32.520
<v Speaker 1>it actually contradicts his own theory.</v>

1323
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young pointed that out to Freud.</v>

1324
01:12:34.321 --> 01:12:34.831
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1325
01:12:34.831 --> 01:12:36.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bit of a logical problem here.</v>

1326
01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:39.900
<v Speaker 1>And Freud said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what caused their break.</v>

1327
01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:45.180
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if we don't go down</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biological determinist route,</v>

1328
01:12:45.690 --> 01:12:49.290
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we'll be overwhelmed by a tide of</v>

1329
01:12:49.291 --> 01:12:51.720
<v Speaker 1>oak nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

1330
01:12:51.721 --> 01:12:54.180
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the act happened there was the Nazis</v>

1331
01:12:54.181 --> 01:12:55.980
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are pretty good at a colt nonsense.</v>

1332
01:12:55.981 --> 01:12:58.140
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the whole new age</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>

1333
01:12:58.520 --> 01:12:59.353
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1334
01:12:59.370 --> 01:13:02.250
<v Speaker 1>youngest young is tangled up in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I don't think he's</v>

1335
01:13:02.251 --> 01:13:05.910
<v Speaker 1>responsible for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Freud wasn't going to go there and he</v>

1336
01:13:05.911 --> 01:13:07.050
<v Speaker 1>had his reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1337
01:13:07.051 --> 01:13:08.880
<v Speaker 1>but young thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's just not,</v>

1338
01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:13.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm going there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because young had a mythical</v>

1339
01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:17.310
<v Speaker 1>poetic imagination of incalculable</v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity.</v>

1340
01:13:17.311 --> 01:13:20.040
<v Speaker 1>And that was just where he was headed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1341
01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:22.290
<v Speaker 1>but Freud figured that out.</v>

1342
01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:23.580
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart.</v>

1343
01:13:23.581 --> 01:13:26.110
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of modern neuroscientists and,</v>

1344
01:13:26.111 --> 01:13:29.580
<v Speaker 1>and modern psychologists haven't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't got anywhere near this yet.</v>

1345
01:13:29.850 --> 01:13:31.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that the unconscious</v>

1346
01:13:31.290 --> 01:13:34.530
<v Speaker 1>unconscious has a Mytho poetic function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1347
01:13:34.531 --> 01:13:37.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you've learned that in any</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your neuroscience courses yet,</v>

1348
01:13:37.530 --> 01:13:38.700
<v Speaker 1>but it's coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1349
01:13:38.701 --> 01:13:41.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the case obviously,</v>

1350
01:13:42.270 --> 01:13:46.740
<v Speaker 1>since we have mytho poetic structures</v>
<v Speaker 1>that came from somewhere and they're not</v>

1351
01:13:46.741 --> 01:13:48.330
<v Speaker 1>just stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1352
01:13:48.331 --> 01:13:49.500
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

1353
01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:54.330
<v Speaker 1>that's car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just not a sophisticated way to</v>

1354
01:13:54.331 --> 01:13:55.680
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1355
01:13:57.810 --> 01:13:58.810
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What time is it?</v>

1356
01:13:58.870 --> 01:14:00.780
<v Speaker 1>It must be getting close cause you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>all getting rustling.</v>

1357
01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Two minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1358
01:14:04.171 --> 01:14:06.930
<v Speaker 1>Well that's good then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what we'll do with the next class is</v>

1359
01:14:06.931 --> 01:14:09.240
<v Speaker 1>we'll go a little farther with Freud and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'm going to show you some,</v>

1360
01:14:09.810 --> 01:14:12.730
<v Speaker 1>I think they're shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be prepared that when I'm going to show</v>

1361
01:14:12.731 --> 01:14:16.750
<v Speaker 1>you is a shocking movie and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if it doesn't make you uncomfortable</v>

1362
01:14:16.810 --> 01:14:21.490
<v Speaker 1>in many ways and squirm around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're just not paying attention.</v>

1363
01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:24.000
<v Speaker 1>So be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be warned.</v>

1364
01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:27.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friday and psychopathology is not</v>

1365
01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:29.140
<v Speaker 1>pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1366
01:14:29.141 --> 01:14:32.260
<v Speaker 1>and it's another reason why people don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to admit that it exists.</v>

1367
01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:34.140
<v Speaker 1>See a suit.</v>

1368
01:14:37.770 --> 01:14:37.830
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
