1
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.420
<v Speaker 1>So I want to continue talking about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>basic story or subpersonality or game or</v>

2
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.613
<v Speaker 2>map.</v>

3
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.220
<v Speaker 1>So what I've discussed with you so far </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there are</v>

4
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.980
<v Speaker 1>different ways that you can construe the</v>
<v Speaker 1>objects and territories that you inhabit</v>

5
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.163
<v Speaker 1>and that modern people generally think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the world they inhabit is the one </v>

6
00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:45.750
<v Speaker 1>that's defined by science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

7
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.830
<v Speaker 1>I would say</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say actually it depends on which</v>

8
00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:53.664
<v Speaker 1>scientist you mean because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that the worldview that emerges </v>

9
00:00:59.071 --> 00:00:59.904
<v Speaker 1>as a logical consequence of Darwinism is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same worldview that emerges as a </v>

10
00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:07.340
<v Speaker 1>logical consequence of Newtonian </v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions.</v>

11
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.213
<v Speaker 1>And</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason I'm bringing Newton into it </v>

12
00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Speaker 1>is because we still think a newtonian </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms.</v>

13
00:01:13.321 --> 00:01:16.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's been more than 100 years or </v>
<v Speaker 1>100 years,</v>

14
00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:20.970
<v Speaker 1>I guess since Newton's models expanded </v>
<v Speaker 1>by quantum physics,</v>

15
00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:23.580
<v Speaker 1>but no one thinks that way because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't think that way.</v>

16
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.443
<v Speaker 1>And besides that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason you don't think that way is </v>

17
00:01:26.551 --> 00:01:30.030
<v Speaker 1>because at the level of resolution that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you exist,</v>

18
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.060
<v Speaker 1>things behave in a newtonian manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's in accordance with our natural,</v>

19
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.680
<v Speaker 1>with some of our natural perceptions.</v>

20
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:40.663
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

21
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.300
<v Speaker 1>I started thinking this way for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>variety of reasons,</v>

22
00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:48.290
<v Speaker 1>but I was influenced later by a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>named Gibson,</v>

23
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.400
<v Speaker 1>Jj Gibson who wrote a book called an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ecological approach to visual perception</v>

24
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.993
<v Speaker 1>and he made the case quite strongly that</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you directly perceive is the </v>

25
00:01:57.831 --> 00:02:01.370
<v Speaker 1>implication of of situations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>objects.</v>

26
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.413
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose you've all seen the famous </v>

27
00:02:05.571 --> 00:02:10.571
<v Speaker 1>visual cliff experiment with babies </v>
<v Speaker 1>where if you put a piece of glass across</v>

28
00:02:11.271 --> 00:02:16.271
<v Speaker 1>the open space and space is evidently </v>
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

29
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.953
<v Speaker 1>the baby won't cross the glass and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some evidence there for </v>

30
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.300
<v Speaker 1>relatively innate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only depth processing.</v>

31
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not just depth process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

32
00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Because in order to not crawl off that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you also have to perceive that,</v>

33
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gibson would say that it's a falling off</v>

34
00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:33.464
<v Speaker 1>place and he would say that's actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you perceive is a falling off </v>

35
00:02:36.981 --> 00:02:37.814
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe you could abstract out </v>

36
00:02:38.961 --> 00:02:39.794
<v Speaker 1>the idea of cliff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't what you perceive and </v>

37
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.173
<v Speaker 1>know</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sense you have that when a bear is </v>

38
00:02:48.081 --> 00:02:50.030
<v Speaker 1>chasing you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's dangerous.</v>

39
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.793
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't seem to be merely </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological in a sense like it's not </v>

40
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.660
<v Speaker 1>merely in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

41
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 1>It's not less real than perceiving the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bearer as an object,</v>

42
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 1>an object that eats you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same object</v>

43
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.010
<v Speaker 1>as an object that remains neutral to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>or positive and it seems quite clear.</v>

44
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 1>And this is where the Darwinian issue I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think arises that</v>

45
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.023
<v Speaker 1>you have to evaluate with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>perception because otherwise you're too </v>

46
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:28.240
<v Speaker 1>slow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

47
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.183
<v Speaker 1>I developed this diagram as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of thinking about these </v>

48
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:34.054
<v Speaker 1>things for a long time and the diagram </v>
<v Speaker 1>is predicated on the idea that when you </v>

49
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.780
<v Speaker 1>begin to act in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're inside of motivational frame,</v>

50
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.440
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that motivational frame can have,</v>

51
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.573
<v Speaker 1>can be,</v>

52
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.933
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

53
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.570
<v Speaker 1>instantiated or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

54
00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:53.773
<v Speaker 1>or put into practice by or put into </v>
<v Speaker 1>place by any number of underlying </v>

55
00:03:57.271 --> 00:03:58.830
<v Speaker 1>motivational system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them,</v>

56
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:00.703
<v Speaker 1>the more basic motivational systems that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we share with animals going far back </v>

57
00:04:06.181 --> 00:04:07.014
<v Speaker 1>down the evolutionary chain and some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the more complex mixtures of emotional </v>

58
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.380
<v Speaker 1>or a motivational drives that had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized across</v>

59
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.710
<v Speaker 1>lengthy periods of time and in social </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>

60
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.250
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

61
00:04:26.251 --> 00:04:29.460
<v Speaker 1>if you're at a bar and you're looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>for someone,</v>

62
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.550
<v Speaker 1>it's not really reasonable to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll we'll take a simple case.</v>

63
00:04:36.751 --> 00:04:37.584
<v Speaker 1>It's not really reasonable to say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>your behavior is motivated by sex </v>

64
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.680
<v Speaker 1>because that's what happens only if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actually in a sexual act.</v>

65
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.633
<v Speaker 1>Before that the motivations are multiple</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have to be because otherwise </v>

66
00:04:54.691 --> 00:04:59.670
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have this sophistication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you begin a conversation with anyone?</v>

67
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.530
<v Speaker 1>And so to think of that as as driven in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense,</v>

68
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.423
<v Speaker 1>bisexuality means either to consider a </v>
<v Speaker 1>much more expanded notion of sexuality </v>

69
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.380
<v Speaker 1>or to not consider it driven in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>

70
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:15.443
<v Speaker 1>Now I think it's reasonable to make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presumption that you're motivated to </v>

71
00:05:21.451 --> 00:05:25.770
<v Speaker 1>move ahead and we know that for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>variety of reasons.</v>

72
00:05:25.771 --> 00:05:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Partly that's because if you look at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>

73
00:05:28.631 --> 00:05:30.630
<v Speaker 1>at the level of the Hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very,</v>

74
00:05:30.631 --> 00:05:35.631
<v Speaker 1>very are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are archaic and Primordial sub system in</v>

75
00:05:36.091 --> 00:05:41.091
<v Speaker 1>the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's roughly divided into two parts</v>

76
00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:42.474
<v Speaker 1>and one part is responsible for a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that we consider basic </v>

77
00:05:46.561 --> 00:05:47.490
<v Speaker 1>motivations.</v>

78
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.080
<v Speaker 1>And the other part is responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration.</v>

79
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.173
<v Speaker 1>And that's so the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dopaminergic tracts that WHO's </v>

80
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:00.494
<v Speaker 1>operation underlies movement forward and</v>
<v Speaker 1>incentive reward and what you generally </v>

81
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:06.434
<v Speaker 1>experience as the sorts of positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions associated with hope and </v>

82
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:09.794
<v Speaker 1>excitement and curiosity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That system is instantiated in the </v>

83
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.950
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus and a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus,</v>

84
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:20.951
<v Speaker 1>this is donut is devoted to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was a very primordial system who's</v>

85
00:06:23.871 --> 00:06:28.871
<v Speaker 1>operation appears to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a default.</v>

86
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.493
<v Speaker 1>It's a default operation if none of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other motivational systems need current </v>

87
00:06:36.471 --> 00:06:38.900
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the other default,</v>

88
00:06:38.901 --> 00:06:39.734
<v Speaker 1>I suppose it's sleep or rest and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly see that in animals because </v>

89
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.870
<v Speaker 1>you know if you have a cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll notice that they sleep.</v>

90
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:45.763
<v Speaker 1>Of course they're nocturnal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they sleep up a large part of the </v>

91
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.590
<v Speaker 1>day and so the dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know if you.</v>

92
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.830
<v Speaker 1>If you're not looking for a partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't want to play,</v>

93
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.480
<v Speaker 1>if you're not hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not thirsty,</v>

94
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:57.703
<v Speaker 1>and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not under the grip of any direct </v>

95
00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 1>biological necessity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

96
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Then your default position is to rest or</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep or to explore.</v>

97
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.620
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about the exploratory </v>
<v Speaker 1>circuit is it's really old.</v>

98
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.760
<v Speaker 1>It's as old as pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's as old as lust.</v>

99
00:07:16.761 --> 00:07:19.520
<v Speaker 1>It's as old as anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's as old as hunger.</v>

100
00:07:19.521 --> 00:07:21.410
<v Speaker 1>It's as old as thirst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's a really,</v>

101
00:07:21.411 --> 00:07:23.000
<v Speaker 1>really old system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>

102
00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:28.001
<v Speaker 1>very primordial system and human beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>are quite hyper exploratory,</v>

103
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:34.660
<v Speaker 1>at least collectively as you can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we keep inventing new things and</v>

104
00:07:35.511 --> 00:07:36.344
<v Speaker 1>exchanging new modes of being and so so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say it in some sense that you </v>

105
00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:43.784
<v Speaker 1>have a drive to engage with the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to expand your domain of knowledge </v>

106
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.593
<v Speaker 1>and the reason that you have that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the human race has has gambled </v>

107
00:07:55.641 --> 00:08:00.641
<v Speaker 1>on that as a sufficient means of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ensuring our reputation into the future.</v>

108
00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:05.450
<v Speaker 1>And it's a strange one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a because most animals are very,</v>

109
00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:06.380
<v Speaker 1>very conservative.</v>

110
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.530
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most human societies are very,</v>

111
00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:10.364
<v Speaker 1>very conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's certainly possible for even </v>

112
00:08:12.471 --> 00:08:13.304
<v Speaker 1>relatively modern human society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say those that have arisen in </v>

113
00:08:16.401 --> 00:08:17.234
<v Speaker 1>the last 50,000 years to remain </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively unchanged for for periods </v>

114
00:08:21.531 --> 00:08:25.370
<v Speaker 1>during that time of up to 10,000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be what happened,</v>

115
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.540
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with regards to the original inhabitants</v>

116
00:08:29.541 --> 00:08:33.350
<v Speaker 1>of Australia and so it stays this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the norm,</v>

117
00:08:33.351 --> 00:08:34.184
<v Speaker 1>not transformation and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even societies that we feel we're very </v>

118
00:08:37.011 --> 00:08:40.880
<v Speaker 1>dynamic like let's say ancient Egypt </v>
<v Speaker 1>still there are,</v>

119
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:42.523
<v Speaker 1>there are indications in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>archaeological record of relatively </v>

120
00:08:45.111 --> 00:08:45.944
<v Speaker 1>unchanged customs and practices for </v>
<v Speaker 1>periods of periods that you would count </v>

121
00:08:49.971 --> 00:08:50.804
<v Speaker 1>in the thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So most animals and many societies that </v>

122
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.970
<v Speaker 1>just doing the same thing over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna.</v>

123
00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.650
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna do the trick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:05.040
<v Speaker 1>and human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that isn't what we're like</v>

125
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:06.583
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

126
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:10.190
<v Speaker 1>God only knows how that originally came </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

127
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the conjunction of many,</v>

128
00:09:12.771 --> 00:09:17.771
<v Speaker 1>many processes enforces and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it would be very,</v>

129
00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:20.990
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to tell a complete causal</v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

130
00:09:20.991 --> 00:09:24.710
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here we are now.</v>

131
00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:26.683
<v Speaker 1>It's reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think of us as motivated to move </v>

132
00:09:30.561 --> 00:09:33.110
<v Speaker 1>forward and motivated to explore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

133
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:37.970
<v Speaker 1>that's the fundamental motivation for </v>
<v Speaker 1>engaging with the world.</v>

134
00:09:37.971 --> 00:09:42.020
<v Speaker 1>Apart from anything that's let's say </v>
<v Speaker 1>strictly lower level biological.</v>

135
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.123
<v Speaker 1>And while we're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also customary for us to look at </v>

136
00:09:48.231 --> 00:09:51.230
<v Speaker 1>the world in terms of its utility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say with human beings,</v>

137
00:09:51.231 --> 00:09:52.064
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

138
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:56.030
<v Speaker 1>it's a very tool based utility because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

139
00:09:56.031 --> 00:09:59.900
<v Speaker 1>our brain is part of our body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our brain is adapted to our body and our</v>

140
00:09:59.901 --> 00:10:00.734
<v Speaker 1>body is adapted to our brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously they call evolved and so the </v>

141
00:10:03.411 --> 00:10:04.244
<v Speaker 1>kind of brain we have is the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain that a creature that stands </v>

142
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.860
<v Speaker 1>upright and can manipulate the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>has,</v>

143
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.530
<v Speaker 1>and we'll see some evidence of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

144
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:14.143
<v Speaker 1>But because we're so handy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can speak with our hands and we can </v>

145
00:10:18.801 --> 00:10:19.634
<v Speaker 1>manipulate things with our hands and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can transform things with our hands and </v>

146
00:10:22.521 --> 00:10:25.070
<v Speaker 1>we can tear things apart and we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>haunt and there's like,</v>

147
00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.040
<v Speaker 1>there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we can plant and there's,</v>

148
00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.500
<v Speaker 1>there's an endless number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities for hand utilization.</v>

149
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:35.660
<v Speaker 1>The world appears to us a rate out as </v>
<v Speaker 1>tools,</v>

150
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:39.050
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a tool would be something.</v>

151
00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:40.323
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to get the word exactly right </v>

152
00:10:41.811 --> 00:10:46.811
<v Speaker 1>because I like tool because tool implies</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you can use.</v>

153
00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas Gibson would have talked about,</v>

154
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:56.560
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did he call it?</v>

155
00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:02.230
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll come to me in a minute.</v>

156
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:03.753
<v Speaker 1>It the word reflects the fact that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world is presenting itself to you as </v>

157
00:11:09.131 --> 00:11:12.130
<v Speaker 1>something that you can use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me just look that up for a second.</v>

158
00:11:12.131 --> 00:11:16.330
<v Speaker 1>That's very annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

159
00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.460
<v Speaker 1>that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not facilitators.</v>

160
00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:18.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

161
00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:22.380
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So naturally when you lay out the world,</v>

162
00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:26.110
<v Speaker 1>if it lays itself out into things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to be useful for you,</v>

163
00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:28.383
<v Speaker 1>things that you're going to get in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>way and then things that have neither </v>

164
00:11:32.771 --> 00:11:33.604
<v Speaker 1>property and under most circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that have neither proper </v>

165
00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:39.183
<v Speaker 1>property are the overwhelming majority </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's partly how you managed to </v>

166
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:48.490
<v Speaker 1>process the world and all of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity with</v>

167
00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:55.240
<v Speaker 1>your relatively narrow processing </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity.</v>

168
00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:56.643
<v Speaker 1>Most things have no significance and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have no significance within this </v>

169
00:12:00.251 --> 00:12:02.200
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very focal frame which is,</v>

170
00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:04.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you remember the hierarchy diagram,</v>

171
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.200
<v Speaker 1>it's like in that hierarchy diagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time you're operating at the</v>

172
00:12:08.201 --> 00:12:10.090
<v Speaker 1>level of motor interaction with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

173
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:13.450
<v Speaker 1>You're actually engaged with the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>either through articulation,</v>

174
00:12:13.451 --> 00:12:14.284
<v Speaker 1>but forget about that for now or you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually in engaged moving in the world </v>

175
00:12:18.131 --> 00:12:20.000
<v Speaker 1>and moving it around and interacting </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

176
00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:21.263
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's as if you're viewing the world </v>

177
00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:24.034
<v Speaker 1>through a series of concentric lenses </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the all of those concentric lenses </v>

178
00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.350
<v Speaker 1>exclude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the very,</v>

179
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:33.833
<v Speaker 1>the highest resolution lens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that enables you to focus </v>

180
00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:36.964
<v Speaker 1>closest is the one that helps you </v>
<v Speaker 1>highlight those few things in the vast </v>

181
00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:43.893
<v Speaker 1>perceptual world of nothingness that </v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed to be critical for that </v>

182
00:12:48.431 --> 00:12:49.264
<v Speaker 1>particular operation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you can see that mean the most </v>

183
00:12:54.221 --> 00:12:55.054
<v Speaker 1>dramatic example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was really personally thrilled about </v>

184
00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:03.990
<v Speaker 1>Dan Simons grill experiments because I'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>been thinking about this for a long time</v>

185
00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:07.713
<v Speaker 1>before that experiment came out and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the clearest demonstration I'd ever </v>

186
00:13:10.361 --> 00:13:10.841
<v Speaker 1>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

187
00:13:10.841 --> 00:13:12.520
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of demonstrations like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that now,</v>

188
00:13:12.521 --> 00:13:13.354
<v Speaker 1>but it was the clearest demonstration </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd ever seen that indeed most of most </v>

189
00:13:17.981 --> 00:13:20.560
<v Speaker 1>of what your perceptual systems do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>exclude.</v>

190
00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:25.300
<v Speaker 1>So now what that means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the tricky thing,</v>

191
00:13:25.301 --> 00:13:26.134
<v Speaker 1>is that what that means is that wrapped </v>
<v Speaker 1>up in what you exclude is the entire is </v>

192
00:13:30.821 --> 00:13:35.821
<v Speaker 1>all of being virtually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very tricky problem because</v>

193
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:40.210
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're excluding all of being,</v>

194
00:13:40.211 --> 00:13:42.880
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're setting its value to zero.</v>

195
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:44.733
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

196
00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.220
<v Speaker 1>except for those few things that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrating on now,</v>

197
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:52.090
<v Speaker 1>everything else is zero and zero and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unchanging.</v>

198
00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:57.460
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with that is that lots </v>
<v Speaker 1>of times that's not right now.</v>

199
00:13:57.461 --> 00:13:58.780
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's right enough.</v>

200
00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Luckily enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

201
00:14:00.251 --> 00:14:03.370
<v Speaker 1>I suppose this is a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution to</v>

202
00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.093
<v Speaker 1>were fast enough or slow enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on how you look at it so that </v>

203
00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:15.810
<v Speaker 1>we can assume constancy across some </v>
<v Speaker 1>spans of time under some conditions.</v>

204
00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:17.463
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a philosophical perspective that's </v>

205
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.233
<v Speaker 1>inadequate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of you might have heard of the </v>

206
00:14:25.571 --> 00:14:27.490
<v Speaker 1>phrase the scandal of induction.</v>

207
00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:29.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

208
00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.100
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

209
00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.300
<v Speaker 1>it's a pointer to a very profound </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical problem.</v>

210
00:14:34.301 --> 00:14:35.134
<v Speaker 1>And the philosophical problem is how do </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that the same thing is that </v>

211
00:14:38.321 --> 00:14:40.300
<v Speaker 1>happened before it's going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>next.</v>

212
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.750
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is generally you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>

213
00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:45.483
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a very tricky issue to come to </v>

214
00:14:47.591 --> 00:14:48.610
<v Speaker 1>terms with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

215
00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can,</v>

216
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.633
<v Speaker 1>you can think of things as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think about a hierarchy of </v>

217
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:57.710
<v Speaker 1>resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

218
00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.053
<v Speaker 1>I think you can think of things as </v>
<v Speaker 1>varying rather predictably in their </v>

219
00:15:02.631 --> 00:15:05.060
<v Speaker 1>unpredictability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

220
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.910
<v Speaker 1>there's some indication that protons </v>
<v Speaker 1>decay,</v>

221
00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:09.463
<v Speaker 1>but they decay over such a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>timeframe that the probability that </v>

222
00:15:11.901 --> 00:15:14.030
<v Speaker 1>that's going to affect us is virtually </v>
<v Speaker 1>zero.</v>

223
00:15:14.031 --> 00:15:14.570
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

224
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:17.540
<v Speaker 1>there's other things that we interact </v>
<v Speaker 1>with quite regularly,</v>

225
00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:18.723
<v Speaker 1>like the sun that are stable across </v>
<v Speaker 1>timeframes that make it virtually </v>

226
00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.073
<v Speaker 1>ignorable.</v>

227
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:28.370
<v Speaker 1>But</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

228
00:15:28.371 --> 00:15:29.204
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a story about that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a good story to indicate how </v>

229
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:37.930
<v Speaker 1>everything is nested in what you ignore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So part of this story is fictional,</v>

230
00:15:38.091 --> 00:15:38.924
<v Speaker 1>but part of it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one time when I was in graduate </v>

231
00:15:42.591 --> 00:15:44.570
<v Speaker 1>school in Quebec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Montreal,</v>

232
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:50.200
<v Speaker 1>I always typing on my hard drive </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer and it stopped and you know,</v>

233
00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.193
<v Speaker 1>computers do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens when your computer </v>

234
00:15:57.331 --> 00:15:58.550
<v Speaker 1>stops?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

235
00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.610
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that happens is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on what you're working on.</v>

236
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.350
<v Speaker 1>That's the critical issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

237
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:04.633
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what happens is you have a </v>

238
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:07.513
<v Speaker 1>reaction that's proportionate to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>deemed importance of what it was that </v>

239
00:16:11.811 --> 00:16:12.644
<v Speaker 1>you're working on and that there's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be an association between that and </v>

240
00:16:15.261 --> 00:16:16.094
<v Speaker 1>deadlines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's going to be an association </v>

241
00:16:17.781 --> 00:16:21.200
<v Speaker 1>between that and amount written that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think he might have lost.</v>

242
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.810
<v Speaker 1>And then there's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's,</v>

243
00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:28.070
<v Speaker 1>there's because what you're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>nested in a hierarchy,</v>

244
00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.173
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing a sentence to write a </v>

245
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:31.243
<v Speaker 1>paragraph to write an essay to handy </v>
<v Speaker 1>essay in to fulfill a requirement of </v>

246
00:16:36.171 --> 00:16:37.004
<v Speaker 1>class to graduate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc. All the way up the nested </v>

247
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:40.513
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be upset in </v>

248
00:16:42.711 --> 00:16:46.670
<v Speaker 1>proportionAte in proportion to the upset</v>
<v Speaker 1>that or to the,</v>

249
00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:51.110
<v Speaker 1>to the cost of this failure in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that entire structure.</v>

250
00:16:51.111 --> 00:16:51.944
<v Speaker 1>And so you do a rough estimate a because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't really know and generally you </v>

251
00:16:54.921 --> 00:16:57.760
<v Speaker 1>don't assume the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although you might immediately cause you</v>

252
00:16:57.761 --> 00:16:58.594
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the sort of situation where </v>

253
00:16:59.181 --> 00:17:00.350
<v Speaker 1>someone will go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

254
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.333
<v Speaker 1>they'll get angry or I will anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll pound my fist on the on and then </v>

255
00:17:04.911 --> 00:17:05.744
<v Speaker 1>I'll curse microsoft usually or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whoever happened to make the </v>

256
00:17:08.661 --> 00:17:11.780
<v Speaker 1>computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all remember that I can usually</v>

257
00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:13.790
<v Speaker 1>fix computers if there's something wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>

258
00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:16.910
<v Speaker 1>and that probably all it needs to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>be rebooted and so forth.</v>

259
00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:21.770
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens to begin with is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>burst of emotion and the reason for that</v>

260
00:17:21.771 --> 00:17:25.730
<v Speaker 1>is that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the significance of the unexpected event</v>

261
00:17:25.731 --> 00:17:26.564
<v Speaker 1>cannot be easily constrained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because there's so manY </v>

262
00:17:30.111 --> 00:17:32.930
<v Speaker 1>things that might've gone wrong now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

263
00:17:32.931 --> 00:17:35.390
<v Speaker 1>because the worst case scenario is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe,</v>

264
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:36.283
<v Speaker 1>maybe your computer's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that's a problem for all sorts </v>

265
00:17:40.161 --> 00:17:44.000
<v Speaker 1>of reasons we don't have to go into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not just a technical problem,</v>

266
00:17:44.001 --> 00:17:44.834
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also a political and social and </v>

267
00:17:46.431 --> 00:17:47.264
<v Speaker 1>economic problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weirdly enough because then when you go </v>

268
00:17:49.891 --> 00:17:50.724
<v Speaker 1>buy a computer you have to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>well who's the manufacturer and where's </v>

269
00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:55.560
<v Speaker 1>the manufacturing done and what's a high</v>
<v Speaker 1>quality computer?</v>

270
00:17:55.561 --> 00:17:57.600
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good luck figuring that out because they</v>

271
00:17:57.601 --> 00:18:00.210
<v Speaker 1>change every month so you just can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep track of it.</v>

272
00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:01.043
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it opens up a whole rat's nest of or </v>

273
00:18:03.001 --> 00:18:05.520
<v Speaker 1>hornet's nest of problems where a pit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes,</v>

274
00:18:05.521 --> 00:18:06.960
<v Speaker 1>which is a better way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

275
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:08.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fine.</v>

276
00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:11.400
<v Speaker 1>So my computer's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I tried to reboot.</v>

277
00:18:11.401 --> 00:18:13.290
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't reboot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think,</v>

278
00:18:13.291 --> 00:18:14.011
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

279
00:18:14.011 --> 00:18:16.480
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's burned out or maybe there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something wrong with the plug.</v>

280
00:18:16.481 --> 00:18:17.314
<v Speaker 1>So I plug a lamp in into the same outlet</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I tried to turn on the lamp and the </v>

281
00:18:21.151 --> 00:18:22.800
<v Speaker 1>lamp doesn't go on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then I think,</v>

282
00:18:22.801 --> 00:18:25.380
<v Speaker 1>aha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I blew a fuse.</v>

283
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:29.460
<v Speaker 1>This place had fuses so fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I go to the fusebox and it's daytime,</v>

284
00:18:29.461 --> 00:18:30.294
<v Speaker 1>so it's not a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I look at the fuses and there's </v>

285
00:18:31.651 --> 00:18:33.600
<v Speaker 1>nothing wrong with the fuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I think,</v>

286
00:18:33.601 --> 00:18:36.600
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go down to the corner store and get</v>

287
00:18:36.601 --> 00:18:38.520
<v Speaker 1>a cigarette because I smoked at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

288
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

289
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.183
<v Speaker 1>I'll think about it on the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I go outside and all the street </v>

290
00:18:42.901 --> 00:18:43.734
<v Speaker 1>lights are off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the whole city has come to a </v>

291
00:18:45.811 --> 00:18:46.740
<v Speaker 1>halt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

292
00:18:46.741 --> 00:18:47.970
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a power outage.</v>

293
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:48.571
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

294
00:18:48.571 --> 00:18:50.520
<v Speaker 1>there was a power outage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's what happened.</v>

295
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:55.950
<v Speaker 1>A solar flare emerged from the sun </v>
<v Speaker 1>surface and it was a whopping big one.</v>

296
00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.233
<v Speaker 1>And a solar flare like that sends out a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wind essentially have charged charged </v>

297
00:19:01.711 --> 00:19:02.544
<v Speaker 1>particles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes zooming towards the earth and </v>

298
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:10.110
<v Speaker 1>there were protected from them for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>variety of reasons,</v>

299
00:19:10.111 --> 00:19:15.111
<v Speaker 1>including the fact that the earth has an</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth's magnetic and for complicated</v>

300
00:19:15.391 --> 00:19:19.410
<v Speaker 1>reasons that helps protect us from from </v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmic rays,</v>

301
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:21.660
<v Speaker 1>which is really a good thing as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm concerned,</v>

302
00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:25.830
<v Speaker 1>but now and then those things are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful that they'll.</v>

303
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's an example,</v>

304
00:19:27.241 --> 00:19:29.130
<v Speaker 1>if you have a hydrogen bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big one,</v>

305
00:19:29.131 --> 00:19:29.964
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you detonated in the middle of north </v>

306
00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:32.670
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the atmosphere,</v>

307
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:33.533
<v Speaker 1>say high up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wipe out all the electronics in the </v>

308
00:19:35.371 --> 00:19:36.204
<v Speaker 1>entire continent permanently because </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that when the bomb goes </v>

309
00:19:39.661 --> 00:19:40.494
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an electromagnetic pulse and </v>

310
00:19:42.031 --> 00:19:42.864
<v Speaker 1>that produces electrical electrical </v>
<v Speaker 1>current that runs through the wire and </v>

311
00:19:46.231 --> 00:19:47.064
<v Speaker 1>that'll be it in very brief obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of sufficient intensity to fry the </v>

312
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:52.223
<v Speaker 1>electronics.</v>

313
00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.260
<v Speaker 1>So well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thAt's what the sun is.</v>

314
00:19:55.261 --> 00:19:56.094
<v Speaker 1>The sun is of massive hydrogen bomb and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so now and then it goes off with the </v>

315
00:19:59.461 --> 00:20:00.294
<v Speaker 1>force of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

316
00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.133
<v Speaker 1>millions of hydrogen bombs and then we </v>
<v Speaker 1>get the pulse and radiating towards us </v>

317
00:20:06.091 --> 00:20:09.690
<v Speaker 1>and then it sets up current in the power</v>
<v Speaker 1>grid,</v>

318
00:20:09.691 --> 00:20:12.510
<v Speaker 1>which is what happened here and takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>out the whole power grid.</v>

319
00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:16.050
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened that at that point </v>
<v Speaker 1>the quebec power grid was down for quite</v>

320
00:20:16.051 --> 00:20:16.884
<v Speaker 1>a while and it was because this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why my computer crashed just </v>

321
00:20:19.741 --> 00:20:22.230
<v Speaker 1>because the sun wasn't as stable as I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought it was,</v>

322
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:23.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

323
00:20:23.961 --> 00:20:24.794
<v Speaker 1>that gives you an example of just how </v>
<v Speaker 1>interconnected things are and how much </v>

324
00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:29.693
<v Speaker 1>what's in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much you're taking for granted when </v>

325
00:20:32.521 --> 00:20:34.950
<v Speaker 1>you make anything invisible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

326
00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:37.500
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that part of what happens in</v>

327
00:20:37.501 --> 00:20:42.150
<v Speaker 1>a civilized society will say a civilized</v>
<v Speaker 1>and productive society is that there are</v>

328
00:20:42.151 --> 00:20:42.984
<v Speaker 1>rules of conduct in place and there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>effective processes in place so that </v>

329
00:20:47.771 --> 00:20:51.670
<v Speaker 1>most of the time you can rely on things </v>
<v Speaker 1>being like they were yesterday.</v>

330
00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.900
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our power supplies unbelievably reliable</v>

331
00:20:55.901 --> 00:20:57.490
<v Speaker 1>given that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>

332
00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:58.623
<v Speaker 1>it's so intrinsically unstable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have to beetle around nonstop </v>

333
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:04.030
<v Speaker 1>just to keep the power on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they do.</v>

334
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.220
<v Speaker 1>And so we can sit here and ignore it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

335
00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:10.780
<v Speaker 1>when we can concentrate on something </v>
<v Speaker 1>more arcane and much more focused,</v>

336
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:12.303
<v Speaker 1>but it's also because we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a relatively peaceful society and </v>

337
00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:19.780
<v Speaker 1>we have relatively free speech and so on</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so forth.</v>

338
00:21:19.781 --> 00:21:20.614
<v Speaker 1>And you can predict with a high degree </v>
<v Speaker 1>of certainty that if you come to class </v>

339
00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:25.780
<v Speaker 1>then what's going to happen in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>class?</v>

340
00:21:25.781 --> 00:21:29.270
<v Speaker 1>The worst that's gonna happen in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>class likely is that you're either going</v>

341
00:21:29.271 --> 00:21:32.860
<v Speaker 1>to get bored or hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's not so bad,</v>

342
00:21:32.861 --> 00:21:34.000
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

343
00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.033
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're going from point a to point b </v>

344
00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:38.860
<v Speaker 1>and you see your tools.</v>

345
00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.300
<v Speaker 3>I still haven't remembered that damn </v>
<v Speaker 3>word.</v>

346
00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:47.530
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell is that word?</v>

347
00:21:47.531 --> 00:21:51.130
<v Speaker 3>That's so annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nope,</v>

348
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.610
<v Speaker 1>whatever you go along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see these tools,</v>

349
00:21:53.611 --> 00:21:56.580
<v Speaker 1>these are things that are going to help </v>
<v Speaker 1>get you to your goal.</v>

350
00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:57.893
<v Speaker 1>And whenever you see those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you get a burst of positive </v>

351
00:22:01.741 --> 00:22:04.260
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And basically that means two things,</v>

352
00:22:04.261 --> 00:22:05.094
<v Speaker 1>that positive emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it as a little dopa mean </v>

353
00:22:06.631 --> 00:22:07.464
<v Speaker 1>care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is where this story </v>

354
00:22:09.781 --> 00:22:12.210
<v Speaker 1>differentiates a little bit from classic</v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors.</v>

355
00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:13.123
<v Speaker 1>So the behaviors would say you get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little dopamine kick and that increases </v>

356
00:22:15.421 --> 00:22:16.254
<v Speaker 1>the probability that the action that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just took will be taken again in the </v>

357
00:22:19.741 --> 00:22:20.610
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

358
00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:26.300
<v Speaker 1>so it's partly because the dopa mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>kick has a positive emotional,</v>

359
00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.113
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it provides a positive emotional </v>

360
00:22:30.721 --> 00:22:31.554
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also because the dopamine </v>

361
00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:33.893
<v Speaker 1>facilitates neural growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're battling along and </v>

362
00:22:36.721 --> 00:22:37.554
<v Speaker 1>something good happens to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your brain makes the things you </v>

363
00:22:40.681 --> 00:22:41.514
<v Speaker 1>were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the circuits that underlie the things </v>

364
00:22:42.571 --> 00:22:45.480
<v Speaker 1>you were doing just before the good </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing happened a little bit stronger.</v>

365
00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:47.293
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the other thing that happens when </v>

366
00:22:49.771 --> 00:22:54.771
<v Speaker 1>you're battling along and doing your </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive thing is that you give a little</v>

367
00:22:55.441 --> 00:22:59.940
<v Speaker 1>dope is that the fact that it's working </v>
<v Speaker 1>also validates your frame of reference.</v>

368
00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

369
00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.490
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

370
00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:06.510
<v Speaker 1>if what you're doing is working and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting what you want,</v>

371
00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:10.920
<v Speaker 1>how is it that your right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>

372
00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:15.660
<v Speaker 1>while in some ways you're right enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>up the entire hierarchy,</v>

373
00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:17.123
<v Speaker 1>and so what that means is that every </v>
<v Speaker 1>time you proceed along the path that </v>

374
00:23:22.111 --> 00:23:22.944
<v Speaker 1>you've chosen and that's working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that entire structure gets </v>

375
00:23:25.291 --> 00:23:28.650
<v Speaker 1>stabilized a bit more and that's how it </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be.</v>

376
00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:30.053
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to work out exactly how this </v>

377
00:23:32.851 --> 00:23:33.684
<v Speaker 1>happens and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think I can give you the best </v>

378
00:23:35.071 --> 00:23:37.170
<v Speaker 1>example by telling you about cocaine </v>
<v Speaker 1>addict.</v>

379
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.233
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

380
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:41.903
<v Speaker 1>addicts used to have this phrase monkey </v>
<v Speaker 1>my back and that phrase referred to the </v>

381
00:23:49.641 --> 00:23:50.474
<v Speaker 1>compulsion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the compulsive subpersonality that </v>

382
00:23:54.201 --> 00:23:55.034
<v Speaker 1>develops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interested nothing but more of the </v>

383
00:23:57.321 --> 00:23:58.154
<v Speaker 1>substance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know what you think about that </v>

384
00:24:01.101 --> 00:24:01.934
<v Speaker 1>as being hurt and you might think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it as a motivational drive or a </v>

385
00:24:04.311 --> 00:24:05.930
<v Speaker 1>biological drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is,</v>

386
00:24:05.931 --> 00:24:07.150
<v Speaker 1>it's not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

387
00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:11.810
<v Speaker 1>we're just not that deterministic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an addicted person,</v>

388
00:24:11.811 --> 00:24:16.811
<v Speaker 1>has grown and addictive subpersonality </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mean grown.</v>

389
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:21.530
<v Speaker 1>It's not psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's psychophysiological.</v>

390
00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:23.930
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so imagine this.</v>

391
00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Imagine this is how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

392
00:24:25.551 --> 00:24:26.610
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll.</v>

393
00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:27.613
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll first tell you what happens to </v>

394
00:24:28.341 --> 00:24:29.174
<v Speaker 1>cocaine addicts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you take them out into a treatment </v>

395
00:24:30.471 --> 00:24:32.900
<v Speaker 1>center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heroin addicts is the same thing roughly</v>

396
00:24:32.901 --> 00:24:33.734
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you take this person who's dependent </v>

397
00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:38.653
<v Speaker 1>out to a treatment center and with </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroin and say you have to let them go </v>

398
00:24:42.501 --> 00:24:47.090
<v Speaker 1>through withdrawal and that takes about </v>
<v Speaker 1>48 hours,</v>

399
00:24:47.091 --> 00:24:50.660
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've seen movie representations of</v>

400
00:24:50.661 --> 00:24:51.494
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's been compared by reasonable </v>

401
00:24:53.751 --> 00:24:58.751
<v Speaker 1>observers to having a very bad flu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so alcohol withdrawal by the way,</v>

402
00:24:59.241 --> 00:25:00.140
<v Speaker 1>that kills you.</v>

403
00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:04.610
<v Speaker 1>Often you have a seizure and you die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so if you're an alcoholic and you go</v>

404
00:25:04.611 --> 00:25:06.530
<v Speaker 1>to the hospital and you need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>detoxify,</v>

405
00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:07.573
<v Speaker 1>they'll give you valium or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that so that you don't seize </v>

406
00:25:10.191 --> 00:25:12.170
<v Speaker 1>yourself to death while you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>withdrawn.</v>

407
00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.553
<v Speaker 1>You know when you have a hangover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of that is part of what's happened </v>

408
00:25:16.521 --> 00:25:18.650
<v Speaker 1>is you've actually lowered your seizure </v>
<v Speaker 1>threshold,</v>

409
00:25:18.651 --> 00:25:21.570
<v Speaker 1>so something to think about if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

410
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:24.860
<v Speaker 1>if you're prone to seizures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a bad idea to have a hangover.</v>

411
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:27.770
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they bred mice to study hangovers.</v>

412
00:25:27.771 --> 00:25:28.604
<v Speaker 1>They bred mice that could drink alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they'd get a very bad hangover </v>

413
00:25:31.701 --> 00:25:33.410
<v Speaker 1>and if you showed them a cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd have a seizure,</v>

414
00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:37.840
<v Speaker 1>so because the fear was enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>trIgger seizures here,</v>

415
00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:38.803
<v Speaker 1>so you've got to get seizures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go somehow if you're going to study </v>

416
00:25:42.441 --> 00:25:45.260
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's so in,</v>

417
00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:46.490
<v Speaker 1>that can be bred so.</v>

418
00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:48.830
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take your,</v>

419
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:50.330
<v Speaker 1>your heroin addict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

420
00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.210
<v Speaker 1>and they get over their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

421
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:53.083
<v Speaker 1>their withdrawal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that means that technically </v>

422
00:25:56.031 --> 00:25:58.910
<v Speaker 1>they're no longer physiologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent on the drug.</v>

423
00:25:58.911 --> 00:26:03.911
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't mean that their work is</v>
<v Speaker 1>over by by no means,</v>

424
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:05.563
<v Speaker 1>but frequently In a treatment center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as the person is nowhere near </v>

425
00:26:08.181 --> 00:26:11.510
<v Speaker 1>where they usually are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once they've gone through withdrawal,</v>

426
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:15.080
<v Speaker 1>they can stay away from the drug quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>effectively,</v>

427
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:16.423
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is as soon as you put </v>
<v Speaker 1>them back in the situation that they </v>

428
00:26:20.241 --> 00:26:21.074
<v Speaker 1>came from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they end there around the things that </v>

429
00:26:24.261 --> 00:26:25.094
<v Speaker 1>have been associated with heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say they get a craving and the </v>

430
00:26:28.881 --> 00:26:29.714
<v Speaker 1>cravings haven't gone away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a different system than the </v>

431
00:26:32.211 --> 00:26:37.211
<v Speaker 1>system that went through withdrawal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so they always relapsed.</v>

432
00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:39.493
<v Speaker 1>So now</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about how this craving works </v>

433
00:26:43.951 --> 00:26:48.570
<v Speaker 1>and I've seen this probably most </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously I guess with cocaine addicts,</v>

434
00:26:48.571 --> 00:26:53.160
<v Speaker 1>but also with alcoholics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so imagine that.</v>

435
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.610
<v Speaker 1>Imagine what you have to do in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become an addict.</v>

436
00:26:57.770 --> 00:26:58.603
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing is you have to start </v>

437
00:26:59.671 --> 00:27:01.650
<v Speaker 1>using the drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

438
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:02.663
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

439
00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:04.230
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fair enough,</v>

440
00:27:04.231 --> 00:27:06.570
<v Speaker 1>so people experiment with all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs and so,</v>

441
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of human nature.</v>

442
00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.370
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's risky and dangerous,</v>

443
00:27:11.371 --> 00:27:13.440
<v Speaker 1>but it's not yet catastrophic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

444
00:27:13.441 --> 00:27:15.900
<v Speaker 1>But then let's say you start using it </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough so that you,</v>

445
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:18.870
<v Speaker 1>you can't not use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to use it everyday or something</v>

446
00:27:18.871 --> 00:27:19.704
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next thing that happens is </v>

447
00:27:21.691 --> 00:27:22.524
<v Speaker 1>that gets a little bit expensive and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>then your life is starting to go </v>

448
00:27:25.621 --> 00:27:26.454
<v Speaker 1>downhill because you're spending all </v>
<v Speaker 1>your tiMe trying to gather resources to </v>

449
00:27:28.501 --> 00:27:29.334
<v Speaker 1>get some more of the drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what you might ask yourself is what </v>

450
00:27:32.941 --> 00:27:33.774
<v Speaker 1>do you have like exactly what's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chain of behaviors that's being </v>

451
00:27:37.921 --> 00:27:39.390
<v Speaker 1>reinforced by the drug?</v>

452
00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere along the way,</v>

453
00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:43.673
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe when you're just starting to </v>

454
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.630
<v Speaker 1>misuse it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's part of you that saying,</v>

455
00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:54.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really this is probably not a good idea,</v>

456
00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:58.170
<v Speaker 1>and then there's another part of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has a different thought which might</v>

457
00:27:58.171 --> 00:27:58.891
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

458
00:27:58.891 --> 00:28:00.360
<v Speaker 1>to hell with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only once.</v>

459
00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:01.713
<v Speaker 1>It's only tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then you take the drug and then </v>

460
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:09.000
<v Speaker 1>there's a chain leading from the thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the drug behavior,</v>

461
00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.200
<v Speaker 1>but the drug reinforces all the way back</v>
<v Speaker 1>along that chain.</v>

462
00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.560
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is that little system </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's thinks,</v>

463
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:17.371
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hell with it,</v>

464
00:28:17.371 --> 00:28:20.280
<v Speaker 1>it's only one night gets a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger.</v>

465
00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get as strong as this systems</v>

466
00:28:24.631 --> 00:28:29.160
<v Speaker 1>that are being reinforced that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>activated directly before the drug</v>

467
00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:31.563
<v Speaker 1>drug hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is is that maybe you take </v>

468
00:28:35.491 --> 00:28:39.720
<v Speaker 1>heroin in 50 different situations and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're conditioning yourself to cues and</v>

469
00:28:39.721 --> 00:28:42.720
<v Speaker 1>all those different situations use </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly different behaviors and so on.</v>

470
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.640
<v Speaker 1>So there's different things being </v>
<v Speaker 1>shaped.</v>

471
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:47.610
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things that's always </v>
<v Speaker 1>being reinforced,</v>

472
00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.820
<v Speaker 1>even though not that much is this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought pattern.</v>

473
00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:52.800
<v Speaker 1>And the thought pattern is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

474
00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:53.843
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hell with it doesn't matter anyways </v>

475
00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:57.900
<v Speaker 1>because he has to think that in order </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

476
00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.780
<v Speaker 1>especially at the beginning of a nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>downhill trip,</v>

477
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.943
<v Speaker 1>you have to think that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is you build this </v>

478
00:29:04.291 --> 00:29:05.124
<v Speaker 1>monster in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's full of lies and rationalizations </v>

479
00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:13.620
<v Speaker 1>and their whatever lies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationalizations allowed you to continue</v>

480
00:29:13.621 --> 00:29:14.454
<v Speaker 1>the behavior to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're making them more and more </v>

481
00:29:17.341 --> 00:29:20.820
<v Speaker 1>potent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you build a subpersonality inside</v>

482
00:29:20.821 --> 00:29:24.090
<v Speaker 1>of you that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a one eyed monster.</v>

483
00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:25.223
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally all it wants is the drug </v>
<v Speaker 1>and its armed with any number of </v>

484
00:29:30.571 --> 00:29:33.840
<v Speaker 1>perfectly depends on how smart you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know like you can.</v>

485
00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:38.670
<v Speaker 1>You can come up with a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful nihilistic,</v>

486
00:29:38.671 --> 00:29:39.630
<v Speaker 1>rational argument.</v>

487
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:40.463
<v Speaker 1>Why about life is futile and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>future's dad and there's nothing better </v>

488
00:29:45.251 --> 00:29:46.084
<v Speaker 1>to do anyways and you'd be a fool to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>engaged in such a destructive society </v>

489
00:29:49.541 --> 00:29:50.770
<v Speaker 1>and et cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

490
00:29:50.771 --> 00:29:52.840
<v Speaker 1>Like you cAn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can conjure up a very,</v>

491
00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:56.710
<v Speaker 1>an argument that's virtually impermeable</v>
<v Speaker 1>to rational</v>

492
00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.590
<v Speaker 1>to rational argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rational counter argument.</v>

493
00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:06.020
<v Speaker 1>Because you know there's some things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you just can't prove.</v>

494
00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.430
<v Speaker 1>You can't prove that life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>intrinsically worthwhile,</v>

495
00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:10.323
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

496
00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:12.083
<v Speaker 1>well for obviously for obvious reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now the reason I told you that is </v>

497
00:30:17.651 --> 00:30:18.484
<v Speaker 1>because I think it's a good example of </v>
<v Speaker 1>how things are nested inside of each </v>

498
00:30:21.521 --> 00:30:22.331
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

499
00:30:22.331 --> 00:30:23.164
<v Speaker 1>and also the relationship between this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this very large nesting of concentric </v>

500
00:30:29.051 --> 00:30:30.100
<v Speaker 1>lenses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

501
00:30:30.101 --> 00:30:33.130
<v Speaker 1>and the way that those things are shaped</v>
<v Speaker 1>and reinforced across time.</v>

502
00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:34.623
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you're acting locally and </v>
<v Speaker 1>something goes the way you wanted to </v>

503
00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:39.003
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not the way you expect because </v>

504
00:30:40.571 --> 00:30:44.110
<v Speaker 1>that's what soaked in vinegar deliver </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Jeffrey Gray and the people who were</v>

505
00:30:44.111 --> 00:30:44.944
<v Speaker 1>looking at the orIenting response first </v>
<v Speaker 1>presumed they presumed that you wanted </v>

506
00:30:48.491 --> 00:30:53.290
<v Speaker 1>things to go the way you expect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not exactly right and it's an</v>

507
00:30:53.291 --> 00:30:54.190
<v Speaker 1>important distinction.</v>

508
00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:59.470
<v Speaker 1>You want things to go the way you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to go and if it's just expectation,</v>

509
00:30:59.471 --> 00:31:02.020
<v Speaker 1>then it's a cold cognitive model of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

510
00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like robotic,</v>

511
00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:05.530
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened now,</v>

512
00:31:05.531 --> 00:31:07.170
<v Speaker 1>be should happen now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See should happen.</v>

513
00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:08.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't how you think at all.</v>

514
00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:09.903
<v Speaker 1>You're always inside of motivational </v>
<v Speaker 1>frame and it isn't only that you expect </v>

515
00:31:13.271 --> 00:31:15.850
<v Speaker 1>the next thing to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if the next thing happens,</v>

516
00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:19.330
<v Speaker 1>it matters whether it's what you want or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

517
00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:20.433
<v Speaker 1>If it's what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that little system is reinforced </v>

518
00:31:23.921 --> 00:31:25.540
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pleasurable for you,</v>

519
00:31:25.541 --> 00:31:26.374
<v Speaker 1>and then the whole hierarchy grows a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit stronger and if it is not </v>

520
00:31:31.421 --> 00:31:32.254
<v Speaker 1>what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you have a problem and that's </v>

521
00:31:34.841 --> 00:31:37.810
<v Speaker 1>where things get weird and interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>

522
00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:39.093
<v Speaker 1>so you're going along from point a to </v>
<v Speaker 1>point b and you can see tools and you </v>

523
00:31:43.691 --> 00:31:47.380
<v Speaker 1>can see obstacles and obstacles or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that get in your path.</v>

524
00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.950
<v Speaker 1>And what that means in some sense is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that what a tool is and what an obstacle</v>

525
00:31:50.951 --> 00:31:55.930
<v Speaker 1>is switches very rapidly as you change </v>
<v Speaker 1>focus and as your intended changes.</v>

526
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:58.510
<v Speaker 1>So it's a dynamic system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

527
00:31:58.511 --> 00:31:59.344
<v Speaker 1>And so the way emotion motion works in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this regard is that if things are going </v>

528
00:32:03.371 --> 00:32:04.204
<v Speaker 1>the way you want them to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you feel positive emotion and that </v>

529
00:32:06.101 --> 00:32:08.140
<v Speaker 1>keeps you moving forward towards your </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal.</v>

530
00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.350
<v Speaker 1>And if you run into an obstacle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you feel negative emotions.</v>

531
00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:15.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the next issue might be,</v>

532
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:16.833
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just exactly what should you experience </v>

533
00:32:19.121 --> 00:32:22.180
<v Speaker 1>when you experience negative emotion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then you might say,</v>

534
00:32:22.181 --> 00:32:23.014
<v Speaker 1>well that's a tricky question because if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you encounter an obstacle that means </v>

535
00:32:30.761 --> 00:32:32.560
<v Speaker 1>that something about your model is </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

536
00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:35.440
<v Speaker 1>because if it was right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you wouldn't have been counted that</v>

537
00:32:35.441 --> 00:32:37.060
<v Speaker 1>obstacle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this is,</v>

538
00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:39.040
<v Speaker 1>this is a very interesting way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

539
00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:43.640
<v Speaker 1>It's a pragmatic way of thinking because</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it illustrates is that whenever you</v>

540
00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:47.390
<v Speaker 1>do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're acting out a theory of truth,</v>

541
00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:48.913
<v Speaker 1>and the theory of truth is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actions that I'm undertaking at the </v>

542
00:32:53.451 --> 00:32:56.600
<v Speaker 1>moment are sufficient to reach the goal </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm aiming at.</v>

543
00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:00.250
<v Speaker 1>And so you set up a theory of truth with</v>
<v Speaker 1>each act.</v>

544
00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:02.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

545
00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:04.970
<v Speaker 1>so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

546
00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:09.710
<v Speaker 1>you're always struck with the reality of</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth and error or correct and incorrect</v>

547
00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:12.490
<v Speaker 1>because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cared,</v>

548
00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:13.333
<v Speaker 1>posit that the goal is worth having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if there's a path to it that might </v>

549
00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:18.133
<v Speaker 1>be clear or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or obstructed without also saying it </v>

550
00:33:21.111 --> 00:33:23.420
<v Speaker 1>matters whether you know what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

551
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:27.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you hit an obstacle</v>

552
00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:31.190
<v Speaker 1>and that produces negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

553
00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:35.300
<v Speaker 1>the problem you have here is that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>principle,</v>

554
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:37.063
<v Speaker 1>the reason you hit that obstacle could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be that there's an error in your nested </v>

555
00:33:41.361 --> 00:33:44.330
<v Speaker 1>model at any level of the model.</v>

556
00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:47.330
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I told you the little </v>
<v Speaker 1>story about the sun.</v>

557
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:48.583
<v Speaker 1>It's like normAlly you just turn your </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer on and off because something </v>

558
00:33:51.951 --> 00:33:56.180
<v Speaker 1>has happened that's local,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now and then your problem is the sun</v>

559
00:33:56.181 --> 00:33:57.014
<v Speaker 1>isn't as reliable as you might like it </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be and so you're faced with is </v>

560
00:34:00.981 --> 00:34:04.910
<v Speaker 1>insanely complex problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not when things go right,</v>

561
00:34:04.911 --> 00:34:05.744
<v Speaker 1>because when things go right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just continue ignoring </v>

562
00:34:07.491 --> 00:34:10.220
<v Speaker 1>everything that you were ignoring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when they go wrong,</v>

563
00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:14.690
<v Speaker 1>the search space that opens up before </v>
<v Speaker 1>you is just about infinite.</v>

564
00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:18.560
<v Speaker 1>Now that that has real world </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences,</v>

565
00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:22.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean one of the things that happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>when people develop panic disorder,</v>

566
00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:23.683
<v Speaker 1>what seems to happen is that I can tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>you the typical story about how you </v>

567
00:34:26.991 --> 00:34:27.824
<v Speaker 1>would develop panic disorder with </v>
<v Speaker 1>agoraphobia because the two things are </v>

568
00:34:30.651 --> 00:34:33.740
<v Speaker 1>somewhat separate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So generally this happens to.</v>

569
00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:37.190
<v Speaker 1>It generally happens to women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It generally happens in their forties.</v>

570
00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.233
<v Speaker 1>Women are more susceptible to anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 1>and depression and men just so you two </v>

571
00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:45.260
<v Speaker 1>were more susceptible to substance abuse</v>
<v Speaker 1>and antisocial behavior</v>

572
00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:52.120
<v Speaker 1>figures that something would go wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

573
00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now what do I ask myself?</v>

574
00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:00.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this is going to disrupt the class,</v>

575
00:35:00.941 --> 00:35:02.920
<v Speaker 1>does it mean that there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong with my computer?</v>

576
00:35:02.921 --> 00:35:07.921
<v Speaker 1>Should I call these help people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'll say,</v>

577
00:35:08.561 --> 00:35:09.394
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll ignore it on the assumption that </v>

578
00:35:10.421 --> 00:35:14.110
<v Speaker 1>it will continue working and until that </v>
<v Speaker 1>had martha says fails,</v>

579
00:35:14.111 --> 00:35:15.520
<v Speaker 1>then we can ignore it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

580
00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:16.803
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so something goes wrong in the search </v>

581
00:35:20.591 --> 00:35:22.490
<v Speaker 1>space opens up in front of you now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

582
00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:23.343
<v Speaker 1>So back to the agoraphobic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what happens to her usually is </v>

583
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:27.063
<v Speaker 1>generally these are people who've had </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent relationships and so perhaps </v>

584
00:35:30.791 --> 00:35:31.624
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a relatively over predictive </v>

585
00:35:34.961 --> 00:35:39.961
<v Speaker 1>family or let's just say protective </v>
<v Speaker 1>family and then they had a,</v>

586
00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:41.183
<v Speaker 1>an intimate relationship early in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>life and maybe that lasted for quite a </v>

587
00:35:43.891 --> 00:35:46.050
<v Speaker 1>long time or maybe they're still married</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the same guy,</v>

588
00:35:46.051 --> 00:35:47.220
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

589
00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:51.150
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and inside that relationship,</v>

590
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:52.343
<v Speaker 1>she's relatively dependent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means probably she doesn't go </v>

591
00:35:54.331 --> 00:35:56.430
<v Speaker 1>anywhere without her husband.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she doesn't,</v>

592
00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:59.160
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't do a lot of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>autonomously,</v>

593
00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:00.690
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

594
00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:02.183
<v Speaker 1>so then</v>

595
00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:09.980
<v Speaker 1>she gets my menopause and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's getting some strange physiological</v>

596
00:36:10.891 --> 00:36:11.724
<v Speaker 1>symptoms from that of various sorts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe at the same time she </v>

597
00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:21.210
<v Speaker 1>maybe she talks to her husband about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>divorce or maybe he talks to her about a</v>

598
00:36:21.211 --> 00:36:22.044
<v Speaker 1>divorce or maybe her sister gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>divorced or maybe a close friend dies </v>

599
00:36:25.651 --> 00:36:27.060
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe her.</v>

600
00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:32.120
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she starts to experience heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>palpitations because of the menopause.</v>

601
00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:37.200
<v Speaker 1>And then she thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>

602
00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:39.593
<v Speaker 1>that could happen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like my whole world could fall </v>

603
00:36:41.401 --> 00:36:42.234
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's one fear my whole world </v>

604
00:36:44.521 --> 00:36:45.354
<v Speaker 1>could fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's sorta the fear of societal </v>

605
00:36:48.001 --> 00:36:50.310
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe that the collapse of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

606
00:36:50.311 --> 00:36:52.980
<v Speaker 1>And then the other fear is often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>

607
00:36:52.981 --> 00:36:54.750
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't be dying of a heart attack.</v>

608
00:36:54.751 --> 00:36:55.584
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens to people who start </v>
<v Speaker 1>to develop panic disorder is that they </v>

609
00:36:59.311 --> 00:37:00.144
<v Speaker 1>ended up going to the emergency room all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time to be checked out by </v>

610
00:37:02.611 --> 00:37:03.444
<v Speaker 1>cardiologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the cardiologists are used to this </v>

611
00:37:05.731 --> 00:37:07.920
<v Speaker 1>and they generally check people up quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>extensively.</v>

612
00:37:07.921 --> 00:37:10.770
<v Speaker 1>But most of the time if there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something up with your heart,</v>

613
00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:13.020
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there could be.</v>

614
00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:18.000
<v Speaker 1>And so then the sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is</v>

615
00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:22.310
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

616
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:24.860
<v Speaker 1>the person who has is developing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>phobia,</v>

617
00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:26.173
<v Speaker 1>starts thinking perhaps about what would</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen if her husband died or if they </v>

618
00:37:29.961 --> 00:37:30.794
<v Speaker 1>got divorced and then she starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about the fact that while she </v>

619
00:37:33.291 --> 00:37:34.124
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really know what she do and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really know how to take care of </v>

620
00:37:36.441 --> 00:37:37.274
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of things and how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how she might take care of the finances </v>

621
00:37:40.011 --> 00:37:44.510
<v Speaker 1>and so forth and so she has no real </v>
<v Speaker 1>place to turn.</v>

622
00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:47.750
<v Speaker 1>And so then then she makes the fatal </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake.</v>

623
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:52.310
<v Speaker 1>She goes out and she starts to panic and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then she goes home.</v>

624
00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:57.500
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you ever develop severe anxiety,</v>

625
00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:01.040
<v Speaker 1>one thing you don't want to do is avoid </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of it.</v>

626
00:38:01.041 --> 00:38:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Because as soon as you avoid because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

627
00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.273
<v Speaker 1>it gets worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is imagine her </v>

628
00:38:06.711 --> 00:38:10.250
<v Speaker 1>anxiety systems are trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>how afraid she should be.</v>

629
00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:13.490
<v Speaker 1>And it ranged from panic stricken to </v>
<v Speaker 1>none.</v>

630
00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:15.133
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anxiety systems have all sorts of </v>

631
00:38:18.801 --> 00:38:22.520
<v Speaker 1>sources of input because they're trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to calculate a very difficult problem.</v>

632
00:38:22.521 --> 00:38:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Like if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when this thing flickered,</v>

633
00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:29.870
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that everyone does is </v>
<v Speaker 1>look around and the reason you do that,</v>

634
00:38:29.871 --> 00:38:33.230
<v Speaker 1>it's called a referencing social </v>
<v Speaker 1>referencing.</v>

635
00:38:33.231 --> 00:38:35.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like how upset should I be about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

636
00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:36.523
<v Speaker 1>You look at everyone's face and you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they're upset or not upset and </v>

637
00:38:39.581 --> 00:38:40.414
<v Speaker 1>everybody kind of comes to an average </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreement about how upsetting this </v>

638
00:38:42.761 --> 00:38:43.630
<v Speaker 1>isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do that very,</v>

639
00:38:43.631 --> 00:38:45.430
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

640
00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:51.030
<v Speaker 1>and we estimate how anxious we should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>by our default neuroticism,</v>

641
00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:55.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I would say generally speaking,</v>

642
00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:56.163
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have higher levels of negative </v>

643
00:38:57.371 --> 00:39:00.940
<v Speaker 1>emotion rather than lower levels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that you,</v>

644
00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:07.020
<v Speaker 1>the severity that you estimate have </v>
<v Speaker 1>given uncertain event to exist to,</v>

645
00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:10.630
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have is higher than the severity.</v>

646
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:14.170
<v Speaker 1>Someone else might estimate if they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>more emotionally stable.</v>

647
00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:16.300
<v Speaker 1>And then there's another input,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

648
00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:17.883
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how roughly how competent do people </v>

649
00:39:19.211 --> 00:39:20.044
<v Speaker 1>around you and you think you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know how afraid you should </v>

650
00:39:23.651 --> 00:39:26.650
<v Speaker 1>be is actually somewhat proportionate to</v>
<v Speaker 1>how competent you are,</v>

651
00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:28.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're.</v>

652
00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:29.253
<v Speaker 1>If you're a well practiced hunter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're out in the forest and a bear </v>

653
00:39:32.261 --> 00:39:33.310
<v Speaker 1>charges you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

654
00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:34.203
<v Speaker 1>well maybe you've seen 100 bears and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what to do and it's like it's a </v>

655
00:39:36.341 --> 00:39:39.220
<v Speaker 1>bear and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not going to run.</v>

656
00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:41.453
<v Speaker 1>And so then the bear probably won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>think you're prey because the bear </v>

657
00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.600
<v Speaker 1>thinks that if you run that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your edible.</v>

658
00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Now the thing that's really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you watch yourself run,</v>

659
00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:53.860
<v Speaker 1>then your brain thinks you're edible </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

660
00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:57.010
<v Speaker 1>So that's another input.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because.</v>

661
00:39:57.070 --> 00:40:00.910
<v Speaker 1>So the anxiety system is doing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>terribly difficult calibration job,</v>

662
00:40:00.911 --> 00:40:02.170
<v Speaker 1>which is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something happened.</v>

663
00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:03.820
<v Speaker 1>How upset should I be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

664
00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:06.210
<v Speaker 1>how upset or other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

665
00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:09.520
<v Speaker 1>what's my physiological response?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does it compare to other times I was</v>

666
00:40:09.521 --> 00:40:11.290
<v Speaker 1>upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are my options?</v>

667
00:40:11.291 --> 00:40:12.124
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things the anxiety system really wants </v>

668
00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:19.140
<v Speaker 1>is it wants you to come up with a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't really care what the plan is,</v>

669
00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:20.133
<v Speaker 1>although you have to believe it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not really a sophisticated </v>

670
00:40:22.691 --> 00:40:25.450
<v Speaker 1>cognitive system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an alarm bell and it says,</v>

671
00:40:25.451 --> 00:40:26.590
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some things up here,</v>

672
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:30.670
<v Speaker 1>you have to knit up your world again and</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it to rest.</v>

673
00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:32.580
<v Speaker 1>We need to be able to ignore everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

674
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:35.410
<v Speaker 1>If you can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing will just go off forever,</v>

675
00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.273
<v Speaker 1>but that's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least in part to people that have </v>

676
00:40:37.421 --> 00:40:40.270
<v Speaker 1>post traumatic stress disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are soldiers,</v>

677
00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:42.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe they've gone out in battle and</v>

678
00:40:42.551 --> 00:40:43.384
<v Speaker 1>they've watched themselves do terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>things because that's actually one of </v>

679
00:40:47.081 --> 00:40:47.914
<v Speaker 1>the most common precedents of </v>
<v Speaker 1>posttraumatic stress disorder and they </v>

680
00:40:50.321 --> 00:40:55.321
<v Speaker 1>have no idea how to represent that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their hierarchical world model.</v>

681
00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:58.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because part of your world model,</v>

682
00:40:58.931 --> 00:41:00.700
<v Speaker 1>a huge part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the what is part,</v>

683
00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's who you are.</v>

684
00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like you might find out that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not who you are,</v>

685
00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:07.630
<v Speaker 1>who you think you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not even who you think you are,</v>

686
00:41:07.631 --> 00:41:08.464
<v Speaker 1>a little tiny bit like there's corners </v>
<v Speaker 1>and nooks and whole unexplored rooms </v>

687
00:41:12.281 --> 00:41:16.890
<v Speaker 1>inside of you that contain things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>if they ever come out like you,</v>

688
00:41:16.891 --> 00:41:18.210
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

689
00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:20.530
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what to do with it.</v>

690
00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:21.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're,</v>

691
00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:24.430
<v Speaker 1>if you've dealt with someone who has </v>
<v Speaker 1>post traumatic stress disorder,</v>

692
00:41:24.431 --> 00:41:27.130
<v Speaker 1>it's very frequently the case that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to,</v>

693
00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:31.000
<v Speaker 1>they have to learn a philosophy of good </v>
<v Speaker 1>and evil in order to recover.</v>

694
00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:32.323
<v Speaker 1>and it has to be sophisticated because </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen these terrible destructive forces </v>

695
00:41:34.971 --> 00:41:37.310
<v Speaker 1>at work and their old world model is </v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

696
00:41:37.311 --> 00:41:39.390
<v Speaker 1>it's just not handling it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

697
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:40.303
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

698
00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:43.453
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what happens is the agoraphobic </v>

699
00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:49.020
<v Speaker 1>person runs and then their anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 1>system says,</v>

700
00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:51.150
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what's chasing and ms dot obviously</v>

701
00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:55.410
<v Speaker 1>a flesh eating predator and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't exactly that.</v>

702
00:41:55.411 --> 00:41:57.660
<v Speaker 1>It thinks that they might have dreams </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

703
00:41:57.661 --> 00:41:58.494
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could easily have dreams of being </v>

704
00:41:59.251 --> 00:42:03.550
<v Speaker 1>pursued,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the same system like the,</v>

705
00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:08.190
<v Speaker 1>the system that we use to run away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that aid us when we were 30 pound</v>

706
00:42:08.191 --> 00:42:09.024
<v Speaker 1>mammals is the same system that we now </v>
<v Speaker 1>use to process relatively abstract </v>

707
00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:16.680
<v Speaker 1>threat and why wouldn't it be ready to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look as far as I'm concerned.</v>

708
00:42:16.681 --> 00:42:17.514
<v Speaker 1>This isn't even a hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we know evolution is </v>

709
00:42:20.101 --> 00:42:20.934
<v Speaker 1>conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything builds on what was there </v>

710
00:42:22.651 --> 00:42:23.484
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what else are you going to use when </v>

711
00:42:25.891 --> 00:42:26.724
<v Speaker 1>you're threatened by some abstract </v>
<v Speaker 1>threat except the system that you used </v>

712
00:42:30.081 --> 00:42:32.100
<v Speaker 1>to use when you were threatened by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>crocodile.</v>

713
00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:34.470
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only,</v>

714
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:39.250
<v Speaker 1>it's exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the way it works.</v>

715
00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:43.390
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

716
00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:44.830
<v Speaker 1>she ends up question</v>

717
00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:45.773
<v Speaker 2>both effect of exercise on anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in mean some people go for a jog </v>

718
00:42:48.651 --> 00:42:49.484
<v Speaker 2>and they feel better like stress relief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're saying if you run in that </v>

719
00:42:55.341 --> 00:42:56.174
<v Speaker 2>trigger zero,</v>

720
00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:56.791
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

721
00:42:56.791 --> 00:42:59.970
<v Speaker 1>you have to run from something just </v>
<v Speaker 1>running.</v>

722
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.420
<v Speaker 1>That's irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You like.</v>

723
00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:02.423
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge difference if you're running</v>
<v Speaker 1>toward something that's way different </v>

724
00:43:05.101 --> 00:43:05.934
<v Speaker 1>than if you're running away from trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say you're like anxious about </v>

725
00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:09.360
<v Speaker 1>assignment and you go for a run and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>come back,</v>

726
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:10.263
<v Speaker 1>more clearheaded to work on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not running from the Assignment </v>

727
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:15.300
<v Speaker 1>or you know you're just going out for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>run.</v>

728
00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:16.940
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

729
00:43:16.941 --> 00:43:18.390
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me give you an example.</v>

730
00:43:18.391 --> 00:43:20.250
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me give you an example.</v>

731
00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:27.260
<v Speaker 1>You take a stressor of a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>magnitude and you and you are interested</v>

732
00:43:27.781 --> 00:43:28.614
<v Speaker 1>in the response of two groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you let one group handled the </v>

733
00:43:31.981 --> 00:43:32.814
<v Speaker 1>stressor voluntarily and you forced the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other group to handle the stressor in </v>

734
00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:38.243
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second group will produce much more </v>

735
00:43:40.321 --> 00:43:41.154
<v Speaker 1>cortisol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the primary stress hormone and </v>

736
00:43:43.201 --> 00:43:46.080
<v Speaker 1>so voluntary approach.</v>

737
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:47.303
<v Speaker 1>You use different psychophysiological </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems for voluntary approach than you </v>

738
00:43:51.091 --> 00:43:51.924
<v Speaker 1>do for retreat and you know part of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing when you're training </v>

739
00:43:54.541 --> 00:43:56.710
<v Speaker 1>someone or when you're doing using </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposure,</v>

740
00:43:56.711 --> 00:43:57.544
<v Speaker 1>say with someone who has a phobia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you're teaching them that the </v>

741
00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:05.190
<v Speaker 1>voluntary approach system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you activate that,</v>

742
00:44:05.191 --> 00:44:07.500
<v Speaker 1>that's a very good way of coping with </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>

743
00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Now they they don't know that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation that we're describing,</v>

744
00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:11.493
<v Speaker 1>because they're not autonomous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they haven't ever moved to rely on that </v>

745
00:44:14.011 --> 00:44:16.920
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know if you're,</v>

746
00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:20.700
<v Speaker 1>if you're faced with a threat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's friday things you can do.</v>

747
00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:24.620
<v Speaker 1>You can just panic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but panic is usually distress.</v>

748
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:26.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a child sort of does that.</v>

749
00:44:26.551 --> 00:44:27.384
<v Speaker 1>When it starts crying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens when the child starts </v>

750
00:44:29.071 --> 00:44:31.770
<v Speaker 1>crying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone comes its rescue,</v>

751
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:32.633
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things you can do is </v>

752
00:44:33.391 --> 00:44:36.510
<v Speaker 1>admit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>distress cries and social resources will</v>

753
00:44:36.511 --> 00:44:39.150
<v Speaker 1>come and be gathered around you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that'll solve the problem,</v>

754
00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:40.433
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't work when your heart is</v>
<v Speaker 1>palpitating because who's going to fix </v>

755
00:44:45.211 --> 00:44:45.510
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

756
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:47.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often these people,</v>

757
00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.433
<v Speaker 1>If you look deeply into their thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're afraid to ride a subway </v>

758
00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:55.350
<v Speaker 1>and actual reason they're afraid to ride</v>
<v Speaker 1>the subway is because they think,</v>

759
00:44:55.351 --> 00:44:56.184
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if the subway gets stopped between </v>

760
00:44:58.620 --> 00:44:59.453
<v Speaker 1>stations and I'm trapped on here and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a heart attack and I can't get to </v>

761
00:45:03.421 --> 00:45:06.630
<v Speaker 1>the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that hospital thing is running around</v>

762
00:45:06.631 --> 00:45:11.310
<v Speaker 1>in their head all the time because their</v>
<v Speaker 1>default strategy for dealing with threat</v>

763
00:45:11.311 --> 00:45:12.144
<v Speaker 1>is to seek authority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that often sets </v>

764
00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:15.953
<v Speaker 1>people up for development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a negative or a phobia is that the </v>

765
00:45:18.691 --> 00:45:19.524
<v Speaker 1>authority that they rely on suddenly </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes uncertain for one reason or </v>

766
00:45:22.561 --> 00:45:23.394
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the person is going to leave and </v>

767
00:45:24.301 --> 00:45:25.134
<v Speaker 1>then they're isolated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe the person like if it's a </v>

768
00:45:27.631 --> 00:45:28.464
<v Speaker 1>husband,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say the person is what good is that if </v>

769
00:45:30.241 --> 00:45:32.100
<v Speaker 1>your heart's palpitating you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a heart attack.</v>

770
00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.650
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a problem that can't be solved that</v>

771
00:45:34.651 --> 00:45:35.880
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you're faced,</v>

772
00:45:35.881 --> 00:45:37.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people might think about that as a whole</v>

773
00:45:37.531 --> 00:45:40.530
<v Speaker 1>existential crisis and it is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>existential crisis.</v>

774
00:45:40.531 --> 00:45:43.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're coming face to face </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your own mortality.</v>

775
00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:45.380
<v Speaker 1>And that's certainly the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say that if,</v>

776
00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:46.740
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

777
00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:47.633
<v Speaker 1>if you're going through menopause at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same time because that's another </v>

778
00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:51.293
<v Speaker 1>profound life shift that indicates that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sort of halfway done or two </v>

779
00:45:55.441 --> 00:45:57.630
<v Speaker 1>thirds of the way done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

780
00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:59.460
<v Speaker 1>And that's of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

781
00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:02.220
<v Speaker 1>you can think about that in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>terror management as well.</v>

782
00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:05.850
<v Speaker 1>So it is an existential crisis and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question is how do you deal with it?</v>

783
00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:10.530
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that generally is by </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming a lot tougher than you are.</v>

784
00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:15.060
<v Speaker 1>And the way that you help people do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you teach them that there are certain</v>

785
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:20.010
<v Speaker 1>dangerous situations they can approach </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can approach them,</v>

786
00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:21.213
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and generally people learn this quite </v>

787
00:46:22.321 --> 00:46:23.370
<v Speaker 1>quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

788
00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:28.700
<v Speaker 1>and so the psychoanalysts believed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you just,</v>

789
00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:32.610
<v Speaker 1>this was the early criticisms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral exposure was that,</v>

790
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:33.623
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you expose someone who's afraid to </v>

791
00:46:35.881 --> 00:46:36.714
<v Speaker 1>say just to an elevator that that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>help the other fears or maybe the fear </v>

792
00:46:40.681 --> 00:46:43.800
<v Speaker 1>will be substituted somewhere else </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's just symptomatic.</v>

793
00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:46.380
<v Speaker 1>But that'd be cool work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not right.</v>

794
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:50.400
<v Speaker 1>And it's because when you expose someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>to an elevator,</v>

795
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:54.150
<v Speaker 1>you're not exposing them to an elevator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're afraid of that elevator,</v>

796
00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:58.200
<v Speaker 1>you're exposing them to their own death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the elevator,</v>

797
00:46:58.201 --> 00:46:59.034
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the reason that behavior exposure </v>

798
00:47:01.021 --> 00:47:01.854
<v Speaker 1>works and it generalizes is because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not easy to specify what the </v>

799
00:47:08.281 --> 00:47:10.130
<v Speaker 1>stimulus is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

800
00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:12.930
<v Speaker 1>when I'm in front of an elevator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an elevator.</v>

801
00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:17.040
<v Speaker 1>When someone with agora phobia is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of an elevator,</v>

802
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:19.410
<v Speaker 1>it's not an elevator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem.</v>

803
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:22.290
<v Speaker 1>If it was just an elevator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just get on it and away they go.</v>

804
00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:23.153
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had one client who was afraid of </v>

805
00:47:24.691 --> 00:47:28.110
<v Speaker 1>elevators and the elevator opened up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said that's a two,</v>

806
00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:30.340
<v Speaker 1>and it was just an immediate response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

807
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:31.263
<v Speaker 1>But you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that was the symbolic </v>

808
00:47:33.431 --> 00:47:37.240
<v Speaker 1>representation that came to mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you could also say that,</v>

809
00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:39.193
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are similarities between an </v>

810
00:47:40.241 --> 00:47:41.074
<v Speaker 1>elevator in it to when you can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>trapped and started an elevator and you </v>

811
00:47:43.181 --> 00:47:45.430
<v Speaker 1>could get trapped inside an elevator and</v>
<v Speaker 1>die,</v>

812
00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:46.413
<v Speaker 1>in which case it would be a two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the logical conclusion from that is </v>

813
00:47:49.121 --> 00:47:52.180
<v Speaker 1>that everything could be a two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you might think,</v>

814
00:47:52.181 --> 00:47:54.610
<v Speaker 1>well the stimulus isn't too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

815
00:47:54.611 --> 00:47:55.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

816
00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:57.520
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be too.</v>

817
00:47:57.610 --> 00:48:00.700
<v Speaker 1>It's unlikely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you might ask also ask yourself</v>

818
00:48:00.701 --> 00:48:01.534
<v Speaker 1>this</v>

819
00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:08.200
<v Speaker 1>if the chance that you're going to die </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere as 100,000 to one,</v>

820
00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:12.190
<v Speaker 1>should you be upset?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well no answer to that as well.</v>

821
00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Dying is of infinite magnitude and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you multiply one in 100,000 byte,</v>

822
00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:20.080
<v Speaker 1>infinite magnitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a very,</v>

823
00:48:20.081 --> 00:48:20.914
<v Speaker 1>very large number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that makes you </v>

824
00:48:23.111 --> 00:48:23.944
<v Speaker 1>wonder is why the hell are people </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrified out of their skin all the </v>

825
00:48:26.411 --> 00:48:29.530
<v Speaker 1>time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is a very good question because</v>

826
00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:33.340
<v Speaker 1>by no means obvious why people aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I actually think,</v>

827
00:48:33.341 --> 00:48:34.174
<v Speaker 1>I often think that the mystery with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>condition like agra phobia isn't that </v>

828
00:48:37.931 --> 00:48:38.764
<v Speaker 1>some people have agoraphobic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that everyone doesn't have it all </v>

829
00:48:41.861 --> 00:48:44.500
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because you know,</v>

830
00:48:44.501 --> 00:48:46.660
<v Speaker 1>when the terror management people talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this too,</v>

831
00:48:46.661 --> 00:48:47.494
<v Speaker 1>is that because we're always confronting</v>
<v Speaker 1>our own mortality and in a world of </v>

832
00:48:50.891 --> 00:48:51.724
<v Speaker 1>infinite complexity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why aren't we constantly in a state of </v>

833
00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:57.130
<v Speaker 1>panic and you know now and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that you think,</v>

834
00:48:57.131 --> 00:48:57.880
<v Speaker 1>jeez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

835
00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:02.530
<v Speaker 1>why aren't we in a state of panic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very unsettling realization.</v>

836
00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:08.010
<v Speaker 1>And why it isn't more common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very,</v>

837
00:49:09.961 --> 00:49:11.310
<v Speaker 1>very complicated question.</v>

838
00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:20.450
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of it is because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>imitate other people and so a lot of our</v>

839
00:49:20.461 --> 00:49:21.294
<v Speaker 1>faith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say in the stability of our lives </v>

840
00:49:24.271 --> 00:49:25.104
<v Speaker 1>and the utility and meaning of our lives</v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually instantiated at an embodied </v>

841
00:49:29.221 --> 00:49:31.770
<v Speaker 1>level where it's not subject to </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticism.</v>

842
00:49:31.771 --> 00:49:33.060
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

843
00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:35.183
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a child two years old and </v>

844
00:49:39.541 --> 00:49:43.470
<v Speaker 1>there's a mother and they're together in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kitchen and the most runs across the</v>

845
00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:45.180
<v Speaker 1>floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

846
00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:46.283
<v Speaker 1>The child orients towards the mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watches it zip across and then looks at </v>

847
00:49:49.771 --> 00:49:52.020
<v Speaker 1>his mother or her mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

848
00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:54.113
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because something anomalous has </v>

849
00:49:54.661 --> 00:49:55.494
<v Speaker 1>occurred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the significance of which is unstated </v>

850
00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:01.380
<v Speaker 1>and it's arousing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

851
00:50:01.381 --> 00:50:02.160
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>

852
00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:03.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be startled by that.</v>

853
00:50:03.601 --> 00:50:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

854
00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Could that sip?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then you think,</v>

855
00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:09.990
<v Speaker 1>what does mom think of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And mom is thinking,</v>

856
00:50:09.991 --> 00:50:10.530
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's him.</v>

857
00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:11.363
<v Speaker 1>I was having.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she'll tell you about mice or </v>

858
00:50:13.051 --> 00:50:15.150
<v Speaker 1>maybe she'll send a trap or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's calm.</v>

859
00:50:15.690 --> 00:50:19.020
<v Speaker 1>And so the child imitates that and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

860
00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:20.123
<v Speaker 1>they've got a sense in their body that </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings can deal with mice and </v>

861
00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:24.570
<v Speaker 1>that's no problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

862
00:50:24.571 --> 00:50:27.890
<v Speaker 1>the alternative is that the most comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and mother on the table,</v>

863
00:50:27.891 --> 00:50:29.420
<v Speaker 1>he starts screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

864
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:30.703
<v Speaker 1>well you could be sure what the child's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do in a situation like that is </v>

865
00:50:33.831 --> 00:50:36.470
<v Speaker 1>burst into tears and be extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>upset,</v>

866
00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:37.983
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of what we're doing when we're </v>

867
00:50:39.831 --> 00:50:40.664
<v Speaker 1>little and we watch people around this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they modeled being calm and so we just </v>

868
00:50:45.201 --> 00:50:50.201
<v Speaker 1>adopt the implicit assumption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an embodied assumption that you can</v>

869
00:50:51.261 --> 00:50:52.094
<v Speaker 1>be calm in these circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And luckily enough we generally don't </v>

870
00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:57.890
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally doesn't come unglued.</v>

871
00:50:58.310 --> 00:51:00.380
<v Speaker 1>But you can unglue it even by deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>

872
00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:02.900
<v Speaker 1>And I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens to people quite frequently.</v>

873
00:51:02.901 --> 00:51:05.450
<v Speaker 1>That would be an existential </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe.</v>

874
00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:09.770
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let me show you something else here.</v>

875
00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:10.963
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

876
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:26.420
<v Speaker 1>same idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this has changed a little bit.</v>

877
00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:28.273
<v Speaker 1>She's going from point a to point b.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what can happen while you can </v>

878
00:51:30.891 --> 00:51:34.700
<v Speaker 1>encounter tools and you cannot encounter</v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacles and use zero almost everything</v>

879
00:51:34.701 --> 00:51:37.310
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can look at it this way too.</v>

880
00:51:37.850 --> 00:51:38.683
<v Speaker 1>When you're moving forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can encounter what you predict that </v>

881
00:51:41.151 --> 00:51:43.970
<v Speaker 1>should really be desired rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicted.</v>

882
00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:44.853
<v Speaker 1>It's an old diagram or you can encounter</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you didn't predict or </v>

883
00:51:48.261 --> 00:51:49.094
<v Speaker 1>desire and if you in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you encounter something that you </v>

884
00:51:52.761 --> 00:51:55.540
<v Speaker 1>predict and desire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have positive emotion.</v>

885
00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:56.413
<v Speaker 1>We know why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're getting to where you want to go </v>

886
00:51:57.381 --> 00:51:58.214
<v Speaker 1>and it validates the whole structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you run into something </v>

887
00:52:01.731 --> 00:52:02.564
<v Speaker 1>unpredicted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then you get that's a threat and </v>

888
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:10.190
<v Speaker 1>you get anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

889
00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:13.850
<v Speaker 1>you also get exploratory and so then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>might say,</v>

890
00:52:13.851 --> 00:52:15.920
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how anxious do you get?</v>

891
00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:17.930
<v Speaker 1>And how exploratory do you get?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>

892
00:52:17.931 --> 00:52:19.850
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's proportional.</v>

893
00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:21.440
<v Speaker 1>imagine the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

894
00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:28.660
<v Speaker 1>if you feel that it's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>a inconvenience that you can make a mild</v>

895
00:52:30.201 --> 00:52:31.034
<v Speaker 1>alteration in direct action and go over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be mildly inconvenienced and </v>

896
00:52:34.761 --> 00:52:35.594
<v Speaker 1>maybe you'll be a bit curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what happens is that as your </v>

897
00:52:38.961 --> 00:52:39.794
<v Speaker 1>suspicion that the error is occurring at</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher and higher and broader and </v>

898
00:52:43.671 --> 00:52:44.504
<v Speaker 1>broader levels in the hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're going to be </v>

899
00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:51.590
<v Speaker 1>anxious and quite anxious compared to </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploratory,</v>

900
00:52:51.591 --> 00:52:54.680
<v Speaker 1>at least initially starts to mound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

901
00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:56.353
<v Speaker 1>and then all those other factors that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about also play a role like you </v>

902
00:52:59.271 --> 00:53:00.500
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your social status,</v>

903
00:53:00.501 --> 00:53:03.140
<v Speaker 1>your neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your sense of self competence,</v>

904
00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:05.420
<v Speaker 1>how much you've explored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those other things.</v>

905
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:08.390
<v Speaker 1>It's very complicated thing to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

906
00:53:08.391 --> 00:53:09.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>address.</v>

907
00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:12.740
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

908
00:53:12.741 --> 00:53:13.574
<v Speaker 1>And so then we're going to concentrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>on what happens if you experience an </v>

909
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:19.940
<v Speaker 1>unpredicted outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>because here's the complicated question.</v>

910
00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:23.030
<v Speaker 1>If you experienced an unpredicted </v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome,</v>

911
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:26.580
<v Speaker 1>can you have a weird problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is,</v>

912
00:53:26.581 --> 00:53:27.414
<v Speaker 1>is that you have to figure out what to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do about something that you don't know </v>

913
00:53:31.141 --> 00:53:31.974
<v Speaker 1>what to do about.</v>

914
00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:37.370
<v Speaker 3>And that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a big problem.</v>

915
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:43.510
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's start with this one.</v>

916
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.823
<v Speaker 1>Alright?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

917
00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:55.640
<v Speaker 1>you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the top left hand corner,</v>

918
00:53:55.641 --> 00:53:56.474
<v Speaker 1>you're in this little frame and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going from point a to point b and you </v>

919
00:54:01.221 --> 00:54:03.380
<v Speaker 1>encounter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm calling it now and uh,</v>

920
00:54:03.381 --> 00:54:04.214
<v Speaker 1>normally and normally it's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that shouldn't be according to your </v>

921
00:54:07.851 --> 00:54:08.900
<v Speaker 1>model of the world.</v>

922
00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:11.103
<v Speaker 3>Now</v>

923
00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:16.190
<v Speaker 1>what that does is it destabilizes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>model at some level of resolution.</v>

924
00:54:16.191 --> 00:54:19.760
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're assuming here is that this is</v>

925
00:54:19.761 --> 00:54:23.390
<v Speaker 1>a relatively high order disruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

926
00:54:23.391 --> 00:54:24.224
<v Speaker 1>So I can give you some examples of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are the heart palpitation example is a </v>

927
00:54:27.591 --> 00:54:30.260
<v Speaker 1>good one because that kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will kind of unglue you.</v>

928
00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:31.573
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you take your child to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hospital because they have a minor </v>

929
00:54:33.711 --> 00:54:35.990
<v Speaker 1>illness and you find out that they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a minor illness,</v>

930
00:54:35.991 --> 00:54:39.350
<v Speaker 1>they have a major illness or you find </v>
<v Speaker 1>that out about yourself or you find that</v>

931
00:54:39.351 --> 00:54:40.184
<v Speaker 1>out about your partner or maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stock market crashes or you have a car </v>

932
00:54:43.701 --> 00:54:47.840
<v Speaker 1>accident or you write the cat and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>end up in the 25th percentile,</v>

933
00:54:47.841 --> 00:54:50.000
<v Speaker 1>like a quarter of the people who take it</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

934
00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:52.310
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bang.</v>

935
00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:53.413
<v Speaker 1>You're not where you thought you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're not going to where you </v>

936
00:54:55.761 --> 00:54:58.550
<v Speaker 1>thought you were going and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what the hell's going on,</v>

937
00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:01.340
<v Speaker 1>and that can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we said,</v>

938
00:55:01.341 --> 00:55:02.900
<v Speaker 1>a small revolution.</v>

939
00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:03.793
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just have to make a detour around it or </v>

940
00:55:05.121 --> 00:55:10.121
<v Speaker 1>it can just sucker punch you and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I've been able to determine.</v>

941
00:55:10.551 --> 00:55:11.384
<v Speaker 1>That's alice down the rabbit hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a descent to the underworld and </v>

942
00:55:15.651 --> 00:55:17.180
<v Speaker 1>what's down in the underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

943
00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:18.043
<v Speaker 1>partly what's don't everything is down </v>
<v Speaker 1>there in the underworld and the the </v>

944
00:55:22.310 --> 00:55:25.250
<v Speaker 1>reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very complicated,</v>

945
00:55:25.251 --> 00:55:29.000
<v Speaker 1>but part of the reason is is that when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when things fall apart,</v>

946
00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:34.540
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to ignore things anymore </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you had this model that told you</v>

947
00:55:34.701 --> 00:55:36.770
<v Speaker 1>what was relevant in the world and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't.</v>

948
00:55:37.070 --> 00:55:37.903
<v Speaker 1>And the real important part of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>model was that it told you what wasn't </v>

949
00:55:40.191 --> 00:55:42.920
<v Speaker 1>relevant and then all of a sudden you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

950
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:48.050
<v Speaker 1>something pops up and takes you down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like everything's relevant.</v>

951
00:55:48.051 --> 00:55:48.884
<v Speaker 1>Everything is potentially relevant and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's terribly stressful because </v>

952
00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:54.170
<v Speaker 1>everything is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should I be angry?</v>

953
00:55:54.170 --> 00:55:56.150
<v Speaker 1>Should I be upset?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should I cry?</v>

954
00:55:56.151 --> 00:55:57.830
<v Speaker 1>Should I get divorced?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should I run away?</v>

955
00:55:57.831 --> 00:55:59.870
<v Speaker 1>Should I commit suicide?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

956
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:01.760
<v Speaker 1>how am I going to come up with a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>plan?</v>

957
00:56:01.761 --> 00:56:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Where am I going to get money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to help me?</v>

958
00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:07.460
<v Speaker 1>What's my future going to look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is my past look like?</v>

959
00:56:07.461 --> 00:56:09.590
<v Speaker 1>What am I going to do today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I going to do tomorrow?</v>

960
00:56:09.591 --> 00:56:10.424
<v Speaker 1>It's like all of these things come up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of that weirdness in the external </v>

961
00:56:13.731 --> 00:56:14.564
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

962
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:15.920
<v Speaker 1>And that would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

963
00:56:15.921 --> 00:56:16.754
<v Speaker 1>let's say that you decide to discover </v>
<v Speaker 1>that your child's sick and let's say </v>

964
00:56:19.551 --> 00:56:21.710
<v Speaker 1>that the doctors really don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do about it.</v>

965
00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:22.873
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've just handed a problem of </v>

966
00:56:24.251 --> 00:56:27.420
<v Speaker 1>infinite complexity and a problem of </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite,</v>

967
00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:32.560
<v Speaker 1>infinite complexity is like a journey </v>
<v Speaker 1>through a maze that has no end.</v>

968
00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:36.280
<v Speaker 1>It'S a branching maize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what you'll find yourself doing,</v>

969
00:56:36.281 --> 00:56:37.114
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going on the internet and spending </v>

970
00:56:38.530 --> 00:56:39.730
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of hours.</v>

971
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:40.563
<v Speaker 1>If you've got a research oriented mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of hours looking up every </v>

972
00:56:43.511 --> 00:56:46.780
<v Speaker 1>single research article you can possibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>find on this condition,</v>

973
00:56:46.930 --> 00:56:47.763
<v Speaker 1>and that'll range from like the farthest</v>
<v Speaker 1>out new age ideas to the most cutting </v>

974
00:56:51.311 --> 00:56:53.050
<v Speaker 1>edge science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can handle that,</v>

975
00:56:53.550 --> 00:56:55.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so good luck with that.</v>

976
00:56:55.570 --> 00:56:56.403
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an infinite search and then </v>

977
00:56:59.230 --> 00:57:03.400
<v Speaker 1>that's not the only problem because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that it's an infinite search</v>

978
00:57:03.401 --> 00:57:04.234
<v Speaker 1>is very bad for you because there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>way you can calculate how much time and </v>

979
00:57:06.521 --> 00:57:08.530
<v Speaker 1>energy it's going to take before you </v>
<v Speaker 1>solve tHe problem.</v>

980
00:57:09.370 --> 00:57:11.830
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>

981
00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:13.870
<v Speaker 1>that's stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

982
00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously it's stressful.</v>

983
00:57:16.091 --> 00:57:16.924
<v Speaker 1>It means that you have an infinite </v>
<v Speaker 1>journey towards an uncertain goal and </v>

984
00:57:20.650 --> 00:57:23.560
<v Speaker 1>you can't even handle that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

985
00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:27.280
<v Speaker 1>Your journeys have to be such that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're self sustaining,</v>

986
00:57:27.281 --> 00:57:28.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

987
00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:31.660
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're on a journey of some sort,</v>

988
00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:32.793
<v Speaker 1>you have to obtain as much matter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy as the journey costs and maybe a </v>

989
00:57:38.981 --> 00:57:41.200
<v Speaker 1>bit more because then you're storing </v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

990
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.770
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

991
00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:42.370
<v Speaker 1>for the future.</v>

992
00:57:42.370 --> 00:57:47.020
<v Speaker 1>But if you've got this path of infinite </v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity laying out in front of you,</v>

993
00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:51.370
<v Speaker 1>it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body can't calibrate that.</v>

994
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:54.580
<v Speaker 1>And so what it does is it throws you </v>
<v Speaker 1>into emergency reaction mode.</v>

995
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:59.350
<v Speaker 1>And emergency reaction mode is prepare </v>
<v Speaker 1>for everything.</v>

996
00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:04.660
<v Speaker 1>And that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so down there in the underworld,</v>

997
00:58:05.770 --> 00:58:09.670
<v Speaker 1>the world itself turns into a maze of </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite complexity,</v>

998
00:58:10.030 --> 00:58:14.940
<v Speaker 1>but you turn into a mass of competing </v>
<v Speaker 1>models and a lot of them are based in,</v>

999
00:58:15.250 --> 00:58:18.070
<v Speaker 1>in very low level motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1000
00:58:18.310 --> 00:58:20.020
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>

1001
00:58:20.021 --> 00:58:22.470
<v Speaker 1>You might be angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows for how long you know,</v>

1002
00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:23.313
<v Speaker 1>if it's a particularly nasty disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be angry for the rest of your </v>

1003
00:58:26.681 --> 00:58:31.681
<v Speaker 1>life and you know you could be angry in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a small way and accept fate or you could</v>

1004
00:58:32.681 --> 00:58:36.120
<v Speaker 1>be so angry that it completely consumes </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and you're.</v>

1005
00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:39.010
<v Speaker 1>You're out for revenge against being </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself mean.</v>

1006
00:58:39.050 --> 00:58:39.883
<v Speaker 1>And that happens to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the only one of the emotions </v>

1007
00:58:43.451 --> 00:58:47.650
<v Speaker 1>and motivational states that are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be hyper activated by the response.</v>

1008
00:58:48.310 --> 00:58:49.143
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is that your system </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapses into the underlying basic </v>

1009
00:58:55.271 --> 00:58:56.104
<v Speaker 1>motivational states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're anxious and afraid and </v>

1010
00:58:58.931 --> 00:59:03.931
<v Speaker 1>angry and exploratory and upset and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these things all at the same time.</v>

1011
00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:07.120
<v Speaker 1>And that is your reaction to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>

1012
00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:12.760
<v Speaker 1>Your reaction to the unknown is stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you aren't where you thought you</v>

1013
00:59:12.761 --> 00:59:13.594
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the next thing is prepare for </v>

1014
00:59:15.851 --> 00:59:16.684
<v Speaker 1>anything and the way you prepare for </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything is by getting ready to do </v>

1015
00:59:20.110 --> 00:59:25.040
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is that you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I kind of think about it as you're in</v>

1016
00:59:25.041 --> 00:59:30.041
<v Speaker 1>a car and you've got the gas pedal </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushed right to the metal and you've got</v>

1017
00:59:30.261 --> 00:59:31.520
<v Speaker 1>the brake on at the same time.</v>

1018
00:59:31.550 --> 00:59:34.250
<v Speaker 1>SO the car is roaring away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1019
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:36.740
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take your foot off the brake man,</v>

1020
00:59:36.741 --> 00:59:37.574
<v Speaker 1>it's going to move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your foot off the brake because you </v>

1021
00:59:39.411 --> 00:59:42.260
<v Speaker 1>don't know where to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're still running at full tilt.</v>

1022
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:46.130
<v Speaker 1>And that'S not psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly right.</v>

1023
00:59:46.131 --> 00:59:46.964
<v Speaker 1>It's psychophysiological cause you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're on energy and material burning </v>

1024
00:59:51.711 --> 00:59:54.410
<v Speaker 1>system and when you crack yourself up </v>
<v Speaker 1>into high gear,</v>

1025
00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:57.620
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to be burning a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>more energy and material.</v>

1026
00:59:57.621 --> 01:00:00.290
<v Speaker 1>And what happenS to people is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1027
01:00:00.291 --> 01:00:01.124
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that happens is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll shut your immune system off </v>

1028
01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:06.620
<v Speaker 1>because if you're being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's costly.</v>

1029
01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:09.050
<v Speaker 1>If you're being chased by a tiger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the hell cares?</v>

1030
01:00:09.051 --> 01:00:11.960
<v Speaker 1>If you get flu in two weeks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like shut that thing off.</v>

1031
01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Everything that has to do with longterm </v>
<v Speaker 1>survival,</v>

1032
01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:19.370
<v Speaker 1>even your ability to think into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm is going to be shut off because</v>

1033
01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:21.883
<v Speaker 1>your ability to think in the longterm </v>
<v Speaker 1>failed and so you default back down to </v>

1034
01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:30.980
<v Speaker 1>instantaneous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>impulsive modes of action and it's,</v>

1035
01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:32.570
<v Speaker 1>it's the right thing to do.</v>

1036
01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:33.433
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might take all of this is a hell of </v>

1037
01:00:34.161 --> 01:00:35.870
<v Speaker 1>a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a cloudy mind,</v>

1038
01:00:36.350 --> 01:00:37.200
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1039
01:00:37.201 --> 01:00:39.600
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're,</v>

1040
01:00:39.690 --> 01:00:40.523
<v Speaker 1>you're wired up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to solve this impossible </v>

1041
01:00:43.311 --> 01:00:44.144
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what the hell do you do when </v>

1042
01:00:45.051 --> 01:00:45.884
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only answer to that is prepare </v>

1043
01:00:50.631 --> 01:00:51.464
<v Speaker 1>for everything because you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>gather some more information and that </v>

1044
01:00:53.901 --> 01:00:55.580
<v Speaker 1>might tell you what needs to be done </v>
<v Speaker 1>next,</v>

1045
01:00:55.581 --> 01:00:58.100
<v Speaker 1>but you have no idea how fast it's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have to be done.</v>

1046
01:00:58.250 --> 01:01:01.000
<v Speaker 1>It might be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to do thiS right now or,</v>

1047
01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:03.830
<v Speaker 1>or you don't get It done at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1048
01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:06.950
<v Speaker 1>So then you're down there in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>underworld where all the,</v>

1049
01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great motivational beasts,</v>

1050
01:01:09.411 --> 01:01:12.170
<v Speaker 1>lurk and where there's an infinite pop </v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of you.</v>

1051
01:01:12.171 --> 01:01:14.510
<v Speaker 1>And It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you don't get out.</v>

1052
01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:17.420
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that that's the thing is,</v>

1053
01:01:17.421 --> 01:01:18.254
<v Speaker 1>is that this isn't psychological and one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the real problems with modern </v>

1054
01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:27.860
<v Speaker 1>clinical psychology and modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatry just conceptually is that</v>

1055
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:32.720
<v Speaker 1>people automatically assume that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a problem,</v>

1056
01:01:32.721 --> 01:01:35.360
<v Speaker 1>like if you're depressed and unhappy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxious,</v>

1057
01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:38.810
<v Speaker 1>well then that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a mental problem.</v>

1058
01:01:38.811 --> 01:01:39.644
<v Speaker 1>It's A psychological problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a problem in so far as </v>

1059
01:01:43.461 --> 01:01:44.294
<v Speaker 1>it's not pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what if you're in a horrible </v>

1060
01:01:47.331 --> 01:01:49.130
<v Speaker 1>situation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1061
01:01:49.131 --> 01:01:50.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cognitive people would say,</v>

1062
01:01:50.511 --> 01:01:51.021
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1063
01:01:51.021 --> 01:01:52.700
<v Speaker 1>you just have to reconstruct It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1064
01:01:52.701 --> 01:01:54.420
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can reconstruct it,</v>

1065
01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:56.420
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not in a horrible situation.</v>

1066
01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:57.763
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things you see with the </v>

1067
01:01:59.481 --> 01:02:02.390
<v Speaker 1>cognitive behaviors for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is when they assess depression,</v>

1068
01:02:02.391 --> 01:02:03.224
<v Speaker 1>they use the beck depression inventory </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'd given the beck depression </v>

1069
01:02:05.691 --> 01:02:10.691
<v Speaker 1>inventory to hundreds of people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their criteria for when you should be an</v>

1070
01:02:12.590 --> 01:02:13.423
<v Speaker 1>outpatient in a psychiatric ward is </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the level of depression that </v>

1071
01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:19.800
<v Speaker 1>one third.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you experienced the first year that</v>

1072
01:02:19.801 --> 01:02:20.634
<v Speaker 1>you were in university?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I've given this instrument to </v>

1073
01:02:23.431 --> 01:02:25.590
<v Speaker 1>lots of university students in one slash</v>
<v Speaker 1>third of them,</v>

1074
01:02:25.591 --> 01:02:30.240
<v Speaker 1>at least In the first year meet criteria</v>
<v Speaker 1>for hospitalization with the back.</v>

1075
01:02:30.241 --> 01:02:32.580
<v Speaker 1>So the way the cognitive behavior is </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1076
01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:34.463
<v Speaker 1>what do you call,</v>

1077
01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:37.733
<v Speaker 1>evade this issue is they just set their </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnostic instruments so low that the </v>

1078
01:02:40.861 --> 01:02:43.680
<v Speaker 1>people that they described as depressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually don't have a problem.</v>

1079
01:02:44.310 --> 01:02:45.780
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think the cutoff for,</v>

1080
01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:48.600
<v Speaker 1>for outpatient is 15.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1081
01:02:48.601 --> 01:02:51.630
<v Speaker 1>you're not happy when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get up 15 on the back.</v>

1082
01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:53.460
<v Speaker 1>But if you are depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a 60,</v>

1083
01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:54.533
<v Speaker 1>it's like your depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you talk to someone like that </v>

1084
01:02:57.061 --> 01:02:59.280
<v Speaker 1>and you find out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe you're depressed,</v>

1085
01:02:59.281 --> 01:03:00.114
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you just have a terrible life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the terrible life is and good luck </v>

1086
01:03:04.591 --> 01:03:09.591
<v Speaker 1>reconstructing that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're not very bright for,</v>

1087
01:03:09.690 --> 01:03:11.460
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big problem.</v>

1088
01:03:11.461 --> 01:03:14.610
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you have an iq of 85 or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have an iq of 80.</v>

1089
01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:17.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like good luck finding a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you do find one,</v>

1090
01:03:17.221 --> 01:03:18.900
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1091
01:03:18.901 --> 01:03:21.990
<v Speaker 1>And it's not going to be stable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get good hours.</v>

1092
01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:23.910
<v Speaker 1>And so then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1093
01:03:23.911 --> 01:03:26.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your only friend is crazy.</v>

1094
01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:30.690
<v Speaker 1>And then your family is like distorted </v>
<v Speaker 1>and twisted up beyond belief.</v>

1095
01:03:30.691 --> 01:03:31.524
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe your mother is a chronic </v>

1096
01:03:32.671 --> 01:03:34.390
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic with dementia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be,</v>

1097
01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:37.380
<v Speaker 1>that'd be a nice touch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1098
01:03:38.130 --> 01:03:41.070
<v Speaker 1>maybe your friends are only not very </v>
<v Speaker 1>good for you.</v>

1099
01:03:41.071 --> 01:03:43.110
<v Speaker 1>They're actively bad for you because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

1100
01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.033
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've fallen in with some bloody </v>

1101
01:03:44.881 --> 01:03:47.850
<v Speaker 1>psychopaths and because you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly bright,</v>

1102
01:03:47.970 --> 01:03:50.760
<v Speaker 1>they can get your money every time you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get your support,</v>

1103
01:03:50.761 --> 01:03:52.890
<v Speaker 1>check your unemployment check or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1104
01:03:52.891 --> 01:03:55.300
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1105
01:03:55.310 --> 01:03:56.143
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get someone like that in your </v>

1106
01:03:56.821 --> 01:03:58.380
<v Speaker 1>practice and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1107
01:03:58.381 --> 01:03:59.470
<v Speaker 1>they're unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1108
01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:01.170
<v Speaker 1>are they depressed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1109
01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:04.453
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in the underworld and it's not </v>

1110
01:04:05.901 --> 01:04:08.660
<v Speaker 1>the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's depressed,</v>

1111
01:04:08.690 --> 01:04:12.740
<v Speaker 1>depressed is someone comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're reasonably well educated,</v>

1112
01:04:13.310 --> 01:04:15.410
<v Speaker 1>they have a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you ask them about the job,</v>

1113
01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:16.081
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1114
01:04:16.081 --> 01:04:16.440
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1115
01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:18.680
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to like my job or maybe I even do</v>

1116
01:04:18.681 --> 01:04:21.050
<v Speaker 1>like my job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just don't find that I'm motivated</v>

1117
01:04:21.051 --> 01:04:21.884
<v Speaker 1>right now and I can't understand why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he asked them about their marriage </v>

1118
01:04:24.741 --> 01:04:25.760
<v Speaker 1>and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1119
01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:27.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a good marriage.</v>

1120
01:04:27.501 --> 01:04:29.030
<v Speaker 1>And then you ask them about their family</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they say,</v>

1121
01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:29.864
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got the average number of family </v>

1122
01:04:30.771 --> 01:04:31.610
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

1123
01:04:31.611 --> 01:04:32.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all things considered,</v>

1124
01:04:32.751 --> 01:04:34.760
<v Speaker 1>it's not too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And So,</v>

1125
01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:37.130
<v Speaker 1>and then they don't have a drug or </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol problem,</v>

1126
01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:39.710
<v Speaker 1>but they score lIke 30 on the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

1127
01:04:39.711 --> 01:04:41.750
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could take some antidepressants.</v>

1128
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:44.540
<v Speaker 1>You're depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a terrible life,</v>

1129
01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:46.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they know that they often don't have</v>

1130
01:04:46.701 --> 01:04:48.320
<v Speaker 1>any real cognitive symptoms either.</v>

1131
01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:49.153
<v Speaker 1>although they might be reacting </v>
<v Speaker 1>negatively to some of the negative </v>

1132
01:04:51.981 --> 01:04:55.400
<v Speaker 1>things are happening with those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something's gone astray,</v>

1133
01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:57.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe their sleep is upset.</v>

1134
01:04:57.231 --> 01:05:00.710
<v Speaker 1>That's often the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when what they're suffering from is a</v>

1135
01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:03.160
<v Speaker 1>disequilibrium of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1136
01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:04.550
<v Speaker 1>fall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep,</v>

1137
01:05:04.551 --> 01:05:05.790
<v Speaker 1>wake rhythms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>

1138
01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:06.703
<v Speaker 1>it's got out of whack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you straighten up your sleep in </v>

1139
01:05:08.091 --> 01:05:10.190
<v Speaker 1>their better or sometimes they need </v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants,</v>

1140
01:05:10.550 --> 01:05:11.383
<v Speaker 1>but for the fIrst person like </v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants might take the edge off </v>

1141
01:05:14.331 --> 01:05:15.980
<v Speaker 1>and maybe not too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

1142
01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:17.693
<v Speaker 1>And what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get the person to </v>

1143
01:05:18.641 --> 01:05:21.760
<v Speaker 1>reconstru that assumes they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>options.</v>

1144
01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:23.073
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with educated smart </v>

1145
01:05:23.921 --> 01:05:26.470
<v Speaker 1>people is they think everybody has </v>
<v Speaker 1>options because they do.</v>

1146
01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:27.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1147
01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:29.050
<v Speaker 1>that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people have,</v>

1148
01:05:30.370 --> 01:05:33.220
<v Speaker 1>some people have no options there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like trapped in a corner.</v>

1149
01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:37.450
<v Speaker 1>And no matter how hard you try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cannot get them out of the corner.</v>

1150
01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:38.533
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it takes a virtual miracle </v>

1151
01:05:39.761 --> 01:05:40.594
<v Speaker 1>before that can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the thing about the underworld is </v>

1152
01:05:42.851 --> 01:05:44.380
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real place.</v>

1153
01:05:44.381 --> 01:05:45.214
<v Speaker 1>It's a real place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And depending of course on how you </v>

1154
01:05:48.101 --> 01:05:51.430
<v Speaker 1>define place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's exactly the issue.</v>

1155
01:05:51.550 --> 01:05:54.580
<v Speaker 1>How should you define plAce?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1156
01:05:55.290 --> 01:05:56.123
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say for the sake of argument </v>

1157
01:05:57.371 --> 01:05:59.980
<v Speaker 1>that you mIght as well define it two </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

1158
01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:04.490
<v Speaker 1>You might as well use the standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>newtonian view that you know the world's</v>

1159
01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:05.343
<v Speaker 1>made out of inanimate material entities </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrayed in a certain manner because </v>

1160
01:06:09.311 --> 01:06:11.590
<v Speaker 1>that's a very useful approach for many </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

1161
01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:14.490
<v Speaker 1>But then there's another perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is no,</v>

1162
01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:14.831
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1163
01:06:14.831 --> 01:06:17.650
<v Speaker 1>The meAnings that are arrayed themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of you in the world.</v>

1164
01:06:17.651 --> 01:06:22.651
<v Speaker 1>Those are real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would also say just mentioned this</v>

1165
01:06:22.841 --> 01:06:23.674
<v Speaker 1>very briefly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that idea I've been </v>

1166
01:06:25.871 --> 01:06:27.670
<v Speaker 1>working on for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>

1167
01:06:34.130 --> 01:06:38.570
<v Speaker 1>there is an implication of darwinian </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory and the implication is that</v>

1168
01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:41.503
<v Speaker 1>we talked about this a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>environments very complex and it's </v>

1169
01:06:45.330 --> 01:06:48.470
<v Speaker 1>transforming unpredictably and so what </v>
<v Speaker 1>that means is</v>

1170
01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.130
<v Speaker 1>you cannot ever be right about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

1171
01:06:52.610 --> 01:06:54.080
<v Speaker 1>So righT.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

1172
01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:59.340
<v Speaker 1>Is out to reach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best you can do is come to partial.</v>

1173
01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:02.570
<v Speaker 1>You can partially accommodated and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd say,</v>

1174
01:07:02.571 --> 01:07:04.520
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how have we partially accommodated?</v>

1175
01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here we are.</v>

1176
01:07:05.930 --> 01:07:08.090
<v Speaker 1>We've been evolving through three and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>half billion years,</v>

1177
01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:12.890
<v Speaker 1>given it our best shot and here we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>these bodies and there are a solution to</v>

1178
01:07:12.891 --> 01:07:15.440
<v Speaker 1>the problems posed by the transforming </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

1179
01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:16.611
<v Speaker 1>And you might Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1180
01:07:16.611 --> 01:07:18.500
<v Speaker 1>how good a solutIon are those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1181
01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:19.783
<v Speaker 1>you got 70 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the best we've been able to manage </v>

1182
01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:22.933
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Managing three and a half billion years </v>

1183
01:07:24.001 --> 01:07:24.834
<v Speaker 1>is to generate up a biological platform </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has enough flexibility to keep up </v>

1184
01:07:28.071 --> 01:07:30.200
<v Speaker 1>with the environment for about 75 years.</v>

1185
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:34.370
<v Speaker 1>So then you think so there's no final </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer to the problem.</v>

1186
01:07:34.371 --> 01:07:35.204
<v Speaker 1>The environment presents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There isn't an it's because it actually </v>

1187
01:07:38.451 --> 01:07:43.010
<v Speaker 1>changes unpredictably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no way of being right now.</v>

1188
01:07:43.011 --> 01:07:43.850
<v Speaker 1>Well then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1189
01:07:43.851 --> 01:07:45.350
<v Speaker 1>what does right mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1190
01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:47.173
<v Speaker 1>from the darwinian perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense there's no other right </v>

1191
01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:54.380
<v Speaker 1>then that you're alive and that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to reproduce.</v>

1192
01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:56.480
<v Speaker 1>That's the best you ever get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1193
01:07:56.481 --> 01:07:59.570
<v Speaker 1>So let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's your pragmatic definition of</v>

1194
01:07:59.571 --> 01:08:00.404
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then what that means is that if </v>

1195
01:08:03.410 --> 01:08:04.243
<v Speaker 1>that is right as far as right can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>determined as far as being human is </v>

1196
01:08:07.971 --> 01:08:08.804
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then when you are reacting by fleeing </v>

1197
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:16.063
<v Speaker 1>freezing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when something terrible is chasing you </v>

1198
01:08:17.451 --> 01:08:22.040
<v Speaker 1>because you perceive it as a threat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that it's a threat is right.</v>

1199
01:08:23.150 --> 01:08:23.983
<v Speaker 1>It's not an overlay on reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you didn't perceive a </v>

1200
01:08:27.051 --> 01:08:29.150
<v Speaker 1>predator as a threat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you would get eaten.</v>

1201
01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:33.400
<v Speaker 1>And so I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1202
01:08:33.401 --> 01:08:37.550
<v Speaker 1>you could think of the darwinian world </v>
<v Speaker 1>as nested inside the newtonian world,</v>

1203
01:08:37.610 --> 01:08:40.010
<v Speaker 1>which is how most scientists think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't believe that.</v>

1204
01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:40.873
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the other way around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the darwinian world is the </v>

1205
01:08:44.150 --> 01:08:44.983
<v Speaker 1>ultimate world in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the newtonian world is just a tiny </v>

1206
01:08:48.141 --> 01:08:50.120
<v Speaker 1>subset of that and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's useful.</v>

1207
01:08:50.121 --> 01:08:51.170
<v Speaker 1>Subsidized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a tool.</v>

1208
01:08:51.171 --> 01:08:53.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a useful subset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the real world,</v>

1209
01:08:54.350 --> 01:08:57.980
<v Speaker 1>the darwinian darwinian takes precedence</v>
<v Speaker 1>over all knowledge structures.</v>

1210
01:08:58.100 --> 01:08:58.933
<v Speaker 1>That's how it looks to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't see a way out of that </v>

1211
01:09:01.851 --> 01:09:04.410
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

1212
01:09:04.411 --> 01:09:05.900
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends to a large.</v>

1213
01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1214
01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:09.060
<v Speaker 4>So are you saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm</v>

1215
01:09:11.110 --> 01:09:14.190
<v Speaker 4>trying to understand saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you saying that</v>

1216
01:09:15.710 --> 01:09:17.810
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our</v>

1217
01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:22.950
<v Speaker 4>estimations of the deterministic </v>
<v Speaker 4>material,</v>

1218
01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:32.640
<v Speaker 4>like a missionary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a ride to find truth so that we can make</v>

1219
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:38.690
<v Speaker 4>assumptions about our.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1220
01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:39.841
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well here,</v>

1221
01:09:39.841 --> 01:09:40.674
<v Speaker 1>here's another example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys can think about this for a </v>

1222
01:09:42.421 --> 01:09:44.820
<v Speaker 1>minute if you like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1223
01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:47.453
<v Speaker 1>let's say that one of the logical </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of pursuing science from a </v>

1224
01:09:50.830 --> 01:09:51.663
<v Speaker 1>newtonian perspective is that you learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to create cross ebola with small </v>

1225
01:09:55.031 --> 01:09:55.864
<v Speaker 1>pox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what the kgb was trying to do </v>

1226
01:09:57.661 --> 01:09:58.680
<v Speaker 1>it in the 19 eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1227
01:09:58.681 --> 01:10:01.500
<v Speaker 1>So you manage that and everyone dots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1228
01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:05.880
<v Speaker 1>how's that for a validation of science?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1229
01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:08.160
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this could happen,</v>

1230
01:10:08.190 --> 01:10:09.023
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our,</v>

1231
01:10:09.210 --> 01:10:10.043
<v Speaker 1>our technological capability which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>fostered by this particular model could </v>

1232
01:10:13.741 --> 01:10:17.610
<v Speaker 1>easily enable us to produce something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will wipe all of this out.</v>

1233
01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:19.170
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well are you going to say,</v>

1234
01:10:19.171 --> 01:10:22.050
<v Speaker 1>well yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apart from that it was right.</v>

1235
01:10:22.830 --> 01:10:23.611
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I think,</v>

1236
01:10:23.611 --> 01:10:25.770
<v Speaker 1>well it's a tricky argument because </v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1237
01:10:25.771 --> 01:10:28.440
<v Speaker 1>So let's say</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

1238
01:10:28.530 --> 01:10:29.363
<v Speaker 1>here's part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I also thought the same thing about </v>

1239
01:10:31.141 --> 01:10:32.070
<v Speaker 1>hydrogen bonds.</v>

1240
01:10:32.070 --> 01:10:32.903
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well obviously the quantum view let's </v>

1241
01:10:35.311 --> 01:10:37.530
<v Speaker 1>say is accurate because if you follow </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1242
01:10:37.531 --> 01:10:41.480
<v Speaker 1>you can make a hydrogen bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you can step back from that and</v>

1243
01:10:41.490 --> 01:10:42.121
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1244
01:10:42.121 --> 01:10:44.070
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is to make a hydrogen bomb</v>

1245
01:10:44.071 --> 01:10:48.750
<v Speaker 1>or to cross ebola with smallpox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to treat the matter that you're</v>

1246
01:10:48.751 --> 01:10:52.890
<v Speaker 1>interacting with as if it's actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate from everything else.</v>

1247
01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:56.580
<v Speaker 1>And the thIng is it's not actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate from everything else.</v>

1248
01:10:56.610 --> 01:10:58.800
<v Speaker 1>It's actually connected to everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

1249
01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:00.390
<v Speaker 1>Now you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1250
01:11:00.391 --> 01:11:01.224
<v Speaker 1>if you treat it as if it's separate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's some operations you can </v>

1251
01:11:03.961 --> 01:11:06.390
<v Speaker 1>undertake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can cross ebola with smallpox,</v>

1252
01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:07.343
<v Speaker 1>but then you've ignored a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like maybe that's not a good </v>

1253
01:11:09.091 --> 01:11:11.010
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then everyone dies.</v>

1254
01:11:11.310 --> 01:11:12.143
<v Speaker 1>And so the reduction is in the model </v>
<v Speaker 1>which helps it specify its target and </v>

1255
01:11:16.081 --> 01:11:16.914
<v Speaker 1>increase its accuracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>has the corresponding negative </v>

1256
01:11:19.411 --> 01:11:20.244
<v Speaker 1>consequence of pretending that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>context within which these enterprises </v>

1257
01:11:24.541 --> 01:11:28.440
<v Speaker 1>are being conducted can be ignored and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's actually appropriate.</v>

1258
01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:31.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big problem</v>

1259
01:11:32.850 --> 01:11:33.683
<v Speaker 4>framework.</v>

1260
01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:37.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's it.</v>

1261
01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:38.613
<v Speaker 1>It's not only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not only because of what it </v>

1262
01:11:40.361 --> 01:11:42.970
<v Speaker 1>provides us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the reason that the evolutionary</v>

1263
01:11:42.971 --> 01:11:43.804
<v Speaker 1>perspective has to be the one that </v>
<v Speaker 1>supersedes is because you cannot model </v>

1264
01:11:50.321 --> 01:11:52.690
<v Speaker 1>the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not possible.</v>

1265
01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:56.680
<v Speaker 1>All you can do is keep up with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only way you can keep up with it</v>

1266
01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:59.380
<v Speaker 1>is through darwinian processes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Random.</v>

1267
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:02.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's not a complete theory,</v>

1268
01:12:02.111 --> 01:12:02.944
<v Speaker 1>but for the sake of argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to generate random alterations </v>

1269
01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:08.081
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

1270
01:12:08.081 --> 01:12:08.914
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in principle we could understand </v>

1271
01:12:10.361 --> 01:12:11.650
<v Speaker 1>everything scientifically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1272
01:12:11.651 --> 01:12:13.630
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in principle we can't.</v>

1273
01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Everything's too complex to understand</v>

1274
01:12:20.610 --> 01:12:24.760
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Confined</v>

1275
01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:29.720
<v Speaker 1>that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1276
01:12:29.770 --> 01:12:31.750
<v Speaker 1>it's more in line with reality.</v>

1277
01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:32.713
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1278
01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:42.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and and you,</v>

1279
01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:43.173
<v Speaker 1>when john was talking about the origin </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the scientific mindset and he traced </v>

1280
01:12:48.291 --> 01:12:52.640
<v Speaker 1>its development back to alchemy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's another reason why the scientific</v>

1281
01:12:52.641 --> 01:12:55.760
<v Speaker 1>mindset is necessarily nested in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological mindset.</v>

1282
01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:01.360
<v Speaker 1>So whAt the outcome is we're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do was to mess around wIth matter and to</v>

1283
01:13:02.301 --> 01:13:07.301
<v Speaker 1>produce something they argued for </v>
<v Speaker 1>centuries over what this thing was,</v>

1284
01:13:07.970 --> 01:13:08.803
<v Speaker 1>this philosopher's stone and what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophers stone would enable the </v>

1285
01:13:13.010 --> 01:13:18.010
<v Speaker 1>holder of it to do would be to transmute</v>
<v Speaker 1>elements into gold.</v>

1286
01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:21.290
<v Speaker 1>So that would make you rich and it would</v>
<v Speaker 1>provide</v>

1287
01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:28.760
<v Speaker 1>immortality and perfect health for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the person who discovered it.</v>

1288
01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what young said,</v>

1289
01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:32.570
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk about this.</v>

1290
01:13:32.571 --> 01:13:33.404
<v Speaker 1>If I have enough energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk about thIs two thirds of the </v>

1291
01:13:35.361 --> 01:13:38.300
<v Speaker 1>way through the class because it's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn complicated that some years I can't</v>

1292
01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:40.460
<v Speaker 1>muster up enough energy to to discuss </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1293
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:45.960
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't believe that,</v>

1294
01:13:46.730 --> 01:13:47.563
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have always been trying to cope </v>

1295
01:13:48.571 --> 01:13:50.670
<v Speaker 1>with their mortality rate and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability.</v>

1296
01:13:50.730 --> 01:13:51.300
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

1297
01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:52.133
<v Speaker 1>That makes perfect sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he did an analysis of western </v>

1298
01:13:54.961 --> 01:13:56.670
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking and said,</v>

1299
01:13:56.671 --> 01:13:58.440
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>

1300
01:13:59.160 --> 01:13:59.993
<v Speaker 1>There was a christian app poc maybe that</v>
<v Speaker 1>lasted about 1600 years roughly </v>

1301
01:14:02.971 --> 01:14:03.804
<v Speaker 1>speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was an idea at the base of it </v>

1302
01:14:04.951 --> 01:14:05.610
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1303
01:14:05.610 --> 01:14:10.080
<v Speaker 1>the idea was that through spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline,</v>

1304
01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:13.060
<v Speaker 1>man could transcend suffering,</v>

1305
01:14:14.650 --> 01:14:18.010
<v Speaker 1>but there was a problem with that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that all this suffering kept happening,</v>

1306
01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:18.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1307
01:14:18.850 --> 01:14:22.630
<v Speaker 1>and there was some warps in the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>because as nature pointed out,</v>

1308
01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:23.633
<v Speaker 1>while this</v>

1309
01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:29.310
<v Speaker 1>seizing of suffering was only going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen after you die and okay,</v>

1310
01:14:29.311 --> 01:14:30.060
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1311
01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:31.650
<v Speaker 1>then you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you live forever in blast.</v>

1312
01:14:31.651 --> 01:14:32.484
<v Speaker 1>But still there's like black plague and </v>
<v Speaker 1>babies dying and crops failing and he </v>

1313
01:14:36.601 --> 01:14:38.940
<v Speaker 1>just doesn't seem that you can just </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ignore that.</v>

1314
01:14:38.941 --> 01:14:41.160
<v Speaker 1>And so you've got 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>16,</v>

1315
01:14:41.161 --> 01:14:43.650
<v Speaker 1>hundred years of christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1316
01:14:43.651 --> 01:14:45.960
<v Speaker 1>and the whole history of christianity </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind that,</v>

1317
01:14:45.961 --> 01:14:50.700
<v Speaker 1>grinding away on this problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to produce a system of redemption</v>

1318
01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:55.550
<v Speaker 1>and it and it doesn't work or it works </v>
<v Speaker 1>partially and,</v>

1319
01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:59.070
<v Speaker 1>and it also ignores certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So partly what it ignores,</v>

1320
01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:01.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the presuppositions of say,</v>

1321
01:15:01.051 --> 01:15:04.800
<v Speaker 1>medieval christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the world roughly speaking,</v>

1322
01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:09.720
<v Speaker 1>is an evil place and that matter is </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt and unworthy of attention.</v>

1323
01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:12.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of young's hypoThesis is that if you</v>

1324
01:15:12.571 --> 01:15:16.290
<v Speaker 1>ignore something long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it starts to demand your attention,</v>

1325
01:15:16.930 --> 01:15:20.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a re repression and then,</v>

1326
01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:21.683
<v Speaker 1>and that's especially the case if </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a problem that you're trying to </v>

1327
01:15:23.581 --> 01:15:26.130
<v Speaker 1>solve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your current worldvIew really isn't</v>

1328
01:15:26.131 --> 01:15:26.700
<v Speaker 1>solving.</v>

1329
01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:31.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like your attention is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>drawn unconsciously to that which you've</v>

1330
01:15:31.441 --> 01:15:32.274
<v Speaker 1>ignored and put down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so yom saw the development of </v>

1331
01:15:36.511 --> 01:15:39.420
<v Speaker 1>alchemy as a parallel to the development</v>
<v Speaker 1>of christianity.</v>

1332
01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:44.840
<v Speaker 1>But alchemy studied matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was for being in a sense,</v>

1333
01:15:44.911 --> 01:15:46.950
<v Speaker 1>it was damned from the christian </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

1334
01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:50.400
<v Speaker 1>the alchemists we're studying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the transmutation of matter.</v>

1335
01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:55.800
<v Speaker 1>They had an intuition that there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>information locked in that in matter and</v>

1336
01:15:55.801 --> 01:15:58.410
<v Speaker 1>that if you could just figure out how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with it property,</v>

1337
01:15:58.411 --> 01:15:59.244
<v Speaker 1>then you could free up the information </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they symbolize that in a dream like </v>

1338
01:16:02.401 --> 01:16:03.234
<v Speaker 1>manner that dreamlike manner was you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could discover the philosopher's stone </v>

1339
01:16:06.391 --> 01:16:08.190
<v Speaker 1>and that would give you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1340
01:16:08.490 --> 01:16:10.530
<v Speaker 1>wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>health and eternal life.</v>

1341
01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as human was concerned,</v>

1342
01:16:12.391 --> 01:16:15.570
<v Speaker 1>that was a century's long dream and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

1343
01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:18.120
<v Speaker 1>it was like an artistic production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wAs like the.</v>

1344
01:16:18.170 --> 01:16:19.003
<v Speaker 1>It was the scaffolding of the scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective because it doesn't like </v>

1345
01:16:21.751 --> 01:16:22.584
<v Speaker 1>people went from medIeval christianity </v>
<v Speaker 1>to full fledged scientists and like </v>

1346
01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:29.910
<v Speaker 1>overnight it took hundreds of years for </v>
<v Speaker 1>this to occur and there were,</v>

1347
01:16:30.090 --> 01:16:33.630
<v Speaker 1>there were changes in the substrata of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought that were occurring.</v>

1348
01:16:33.650 --> 01:16:37.890
<v Speaker 1>As this was happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you trace that back more than 1600 years</v>

1349
01:16:37.891 --> 01:16:42.000
<v Speaker 1>in the development of alchemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the dream of alchemy was that you</v>

1350
01:16:42.001 --> 01:16:42.834
<v Speaker 1>could discover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could master the transmutation of </v>

1351
01:16:44.911 --> 01:16:45.744
<v Speaker 1>matter such that there'd be no disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that no one would die and everyone was </v>

1352
01:16:48.241 --> 01:16:49.470
<v Speaker 1>wealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1353
01:16:49.530 --> 01:16:53.010
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That as far as young was concerned,</v>

1354
01:16:53.011 --> 01:16:53.844
<v Speaker 1>that provided the motivation for science</v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things you might ask </v>

1355
01:16:56.911 --> 01:16:57.600
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1356
01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:00.030
<v Speaker 1>why do people do science?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1357
01:17:00.270 --> 01:17:02.160
<v Speaker 1>most people never have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1358
01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:04.200
<v Speaker 1>It's not very old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>600 years.</v>

1359
01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:06.780
<v Speaker 1>It only emerged in one place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking.</v>

1360
01:17:06.930 --> 01:17:08.740
<v Speaker 1>It's very fragile and not.</v>

1361
01:17:09.770 --> 01:17:13.220
<v Speaker 1>And plus just think of what you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do if you're a scientist,</v>

1362
01:17:13.221 --> 01:17:14.054
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a scientist and use a </v>

1363
01:17:15.291 --> 01:17:18.080
<v Speaker 1>microscope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a high powered microscope,</v>

1364
01:17:18.110 --> 01:17:18.943
<v Speaker 1>you have to spend 10,000 hours looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>through that damn thing before you can </v>

1365
01:17:21.891 --> 01:17:22.724
<v Speaker 1>see what's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you think that's a weird thing </v>

1366
01:17:25.221 --> 01:17:28.100
<v Speaker 1>for a tree dwelling ape to be doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1367
01:17:28.101 --> 01:17:29.780
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a war pub.</v>

1368
01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:32.810
<v Speaker 1>our natural of our natural instincts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

1369
01:17:32.811 --> 01:17:33.441
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1370
01:17:33.441 --> 01:17:34.274
<v Speaker 1>our desire to make contact with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and to be doing something </v>

1371
01:17:36.771 --> 01:17:39.590
<v Speaker 1>exciting and you're looking through this</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn too,</v>

1372
01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:41.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's even painful.</v>

1373
01:17:41.210 --> 01:17:44.600
<v Speaker 1>What the hell is motivating you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer would be,</v>

1374
01:17:44.601 --> 01:17:47.420
<v Speaker 1>well you think you're doing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

1375
01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:50.180
<v Speaker 1>You think that science is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit mankind.</v>

1376
01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:53.180
<v Speaker 1>So it's nested necessarily in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational system.</v>

1377
01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:56.750
<v Speaker 1>It isn't that you do science because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to discover facts,</v>

1378
01:17:57.230 --> 01:18:02.230
<v Speaker 1>it's that you do science to discover </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts so that things improve isn't it,</v>

1379
01:18:02.930 --> 01:18:03.763
<v Speaker 1>and you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just kind of ignore the fact that </v>

1380
01:18:06.141 --> 01:18:08.450
<v Speaker 1>you're doing it in the hopes that thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>

1381
01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:09.680
<v Speaker 1>things will improve.</v>

1382
01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:12.110
<v Speaker 1>You can't just take that out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>equation and say,</v>

1383
01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:13.910
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm purely objective.</v>

1384
01:18:13.911 --> 01:18:14.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1385
01:18:14.961 --> 01:18:17.480
<v Speaker 1>you're not and you better not be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1386
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:18.343
<v Speaker 1>because a purely objective person </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be a person you couldn't even </v>

1387
01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:25.070
<v Speaker 1>communicate with someone like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus they wouldn't be able to.</v>

1388
01:18:25.190 --> 01:18:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Someone like that wouldn't be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>determine what was relevant.</v>

1389
01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:30.800
<v Speaker 1>Just distinguish what was relevant from </v>
<v Speaker 1>what wasn't relevant.</v>

1390
01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:33.470
<v Speaker 1>If you need motivational systems to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1391
01:18:33.471 --> 01:18:35.660
<v Speaker 1>and I can tell you when you're looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>at a data set,</v>

1392
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:38.270
<v Speaker 1>there's an infinite number of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can,</v>

1393
01:18:38.710 --> 01:18:41.030
<v Speaker 1>that you can look at in that data set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally.</v>

1394
01:18:41.031 --> 01:18:44.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no end to the statistical</v>
<v Speaker 1>procedures that you can,</v>

1395
01:18:45.230 --> 01:18:47.060
<v Speaker 1>that you can implement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like fiddling,</v>

1396
01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:50.000
<v Speaker 1>fiddling with a photo in photoshop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1397
01:18:50.001 --> 01:18:50.834
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can fiddle with that damn thing for </v>

1398
01:18:52.161 --> 01:18:53.150
<v Speaker 1>the rest of your life.</v>

1399
01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:54.433
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity that's there can't be dealt </v>

1400
01:18:59.151 --> 01:19:02.120
<v Speaker 1>with objectively because if you deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it objectively,</v>

1401
01:19:02.121 --> 01:19:07.121
<v Speaker 1>there is no way of separating the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>path through the data from all the other</v>

1402
01:19:07.401 --> 01:19:08.234
<v Speaker 1>millions of paths through the data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like when you're doing </v>

1403
01:19:10.101 --> 01:19:10.940
<v Speaker 1>statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1404
01:19:11.150 --> 01:19:11.983
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you take a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers and you feed it through a meat </v>

1405
01:19:13.521 --> 01:19:14.354
<v Speaker 1>grinder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Outcome results like it is absolutely </v>

1406
01:19:16.041 --> 01:19:16.874
<v Speaker 1>nothing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're making ethical choices at every </v>

1407
01:19:19.461 --> 01:19:22.040
<v Speaker 1>single level of the decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1408
01:19:22.041 --> 01:19:24.350
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I teach my students this too,</v>

1409
01:19:24.351 --> 01:19:28.510
<v Speaker 1>so I want them to be straight scientists</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's lots of things that can work</v>

1410
01:19:28.511 --> 01:19:31.070
<v Speaker 1>you as a scientist and one can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to have a career.</v>

1411
01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:34.020
<v Speaker 1>And then the other is that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>climb up the dough,</v>

1412
01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:35.720
<v Speaker 1>the primate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scientists,</v>

1413
01:19:35.721 --> 01:19:37.820
<v Speaker 1>primate dominance hierarchy and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1414
01:19:37.821 --> 01:19:38.654
<v Speaker 1>fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to have a career and maybe the </v>

1415
01:19:41.031 --> 01:19:42.140
<v Speaker 1>ambition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worth it.</v>

1416
01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:42.973
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with that is that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can make you do things that violate the </v>

1417
01:19:46.371 --> 01:19:49.340
<v Speaker 1>principles of the entire enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's happening.</v>

1418
01:19:49.670 --> 01:19:50.503
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's been scandalous particularly</v>
<v Speaker 1>in social psychology because people do </v>

1419
01:19:53.301 --> 01:19:56.960
<v Speaker 1>what's called data mining and they just </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep doing their analysis till something</v>

1420
01:19:56.961 --> 01:20:00.530
<v Speaker 1>significant pops up and then they write </v>
<v Speaker 1>a story about why that's important.</v>

1421
01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:02.630
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not cynical about that.</v>

1422
01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:05.960
<v Speaker 1>I understand why it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's inevitable that it happened</v>

1423
01:20:05.961 --> 01:20:09.030
<v Speaker 1>some because lots of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>publishing,</v>

1424
01:20:09.031 --> 01:20:11.700
<v Speaker 1>it's like the first bloody finger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>second thing they've ever published.</v>

1425
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:13.680
<v Speaker 1>They don't know whAt they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1426
01:20:13.681 --> 01:20:16.440
<v Speaker 1>so there's going to be error like map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

1427
01:20:16.650 --> 01:20:17.910
<v Speaker 1>what I tell my students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1428
01:20:17.911 --> 01:20:20.310
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to do statistical </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis properly,</v>

1429
01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:24.000
<v Speaker 1>you have to get yourself oriented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the hell are you do it?</v>

1430
01:20:24.690 --> 01:20:26.040
<v Speaker 1>What is it that you're really doing?</v>

1431
01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:27.990
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1432
01:20:27.991 --> 01:20:28.824
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to discover something solid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I'm trying to do that is </v>

1433
01:20:31.141 --> 01:20:32.880
<v Speaker 1>because there should be benefits from </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1434
01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:34.013
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise the whole enterprise is </v>
<v Speaker 1>foolish and you might as well be a </v>

1435
01:20:36.001 --> 01:20:36.834
<v Speaker 1>bloody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might as well go work in finance if </v>

1436
01:20:38.251 --> 01:20:39.930
<v Speaker 1>you're not interested in that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you really,</v>

1437
01:20:39.931 --> 01:20:43.440
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to make any money as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientist and you can make lots of money</v>

1438
01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:46.320
<v Speaker 1>in finance and you're smart enough to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>into finance.</v>

1439
01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:49.620
<v Speaker 1>So if that's what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want power and money,</v>

1440
01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:53.040
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not complaining about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like goal where it is,</v>

1441
01:20:53.130 --> 01:20:56.760
<v Speaker 1>but science isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to discover facts maybe,</v>

1442
01:20:57.210 --> 01:20:59.970
<v Speaker 1>and that may be of some benefit at some </v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

1443
01:20:59.971 --> 01:21:01.920
<v Speaker 1>then you become a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1444
01:21:01.921 --> 01:21:02.754
<v Speaker 1>So that you've got to keep your eye on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ball and then you have to decide if </v>

1445
01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:06.593
<v Speaker 1>pursuing that line of truth and benefit </v>
<v Speaker 1>supersedes whatever you might do to </v>

1446
01:21:10.651 --> 01:21:11.580
<v Speaker 1>build your career.</v>

1447
01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:13.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're always playing that game.</v>

1448
01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's your whole life.</v>

1449
01:21:15.150 --> 01:21:15.983
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually why so much of </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific research is wrong if there's </v>

1450
01:21:19.771 --> 01:21:20.604
<v Speaker 1>an error too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's all sorts of other reasons </v>

1451
01:21:21.751 --> 01:21:22.584
<v Speaker 1>and you can't expect the system to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>much better than produced five percent </v>

1452
01:21:25.501 --> 01:21:27.780
<v Speaker 1>of useful output anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1453
01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:29.453
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the other thing is you have to </v>

1454
01:21:30.601 --> 01:21:34.020
<v Speaker 1>also be afraid and here's what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be afraid of.</v>

1455
01:21:34.710 --> 01:21:36.930
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you discover something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't there.</v>

1456
01:21:37.410 --> 01:21:38.243
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to spend your next 15 </v>

1457
01:21:39.811 --> 01:21:40.644
<v Speaker 1>years studying it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to spend your next 15 </v>

1458
01:21:43.051 --> 01:21:46.140
<v Speaker 1>years studying this thing that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>conjured out of nothing,</v>

1459
01:21:46.141 --> 01:21:48.600
<v Speaker 1>then go right ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't want to do that,</v>

1460
01:21:48.601 --> 01:21:49.434
<v Speaker 1>then you better be properly oriented </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you do your statistical analysis </v>

1461
01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:53.213
<v Speaker 1>and that's because statistical analysis </v>
<v Speaker 1>is an ethical process and so it's </v>

1462
01:21:56.341 --> 01:21:58.350
<v Speaker 1>science because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be.</v>

1463
01:21:58.890 --> 01:21:59.723
<v Speaker 1>If it isn't nested inside ethics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally then it who god only </v>

1464
01:22:05.761 --> 01:22:07.410
<v Speaker 1>knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be completely destructive.</v>

1465
01:22:07.411 --> 01:22:09.990
<v Speaker 1>It could be counterproductive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like so.</v>

1466
01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:12.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then there's a variety of reasons why</v>

1467
01:22:13.290 --> 01:22:17.280
<v Speaker 1>that darwinian bucket is sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>

1468
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:18.183
<v Speaker 1>It's the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get any farther out than that </v>

1469
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:22.950
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1470
01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:25.790
<v Speaker 1>And it's the darwinian world too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which were adaptive,</v>

1471
01:22:26.430 --> 01:22:27.263
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why we perceive things as </v>

1472
01:22:28.111 --> 01:22:28.944
<v Speaker 1>threats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we perceive things as </v>

1473
01:22:30.031 --> 01:22:30.864
<v Speaker 1>positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we perceive things as </v>

1474
01:22:31.921 --> 01:22:32.970
<v Speaker 1>negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1475
01:22:32.971 --> 01:22:36.450
<v Speaker 1>when we tend to think that those are </v>
<v Speaker 1>overlays on a deeper reality,</v>

1476
01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:40.260
<v Speaker 1>it's like that is not so clear and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1477
01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:44.040
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I was working out these ideas,</v>

1478
01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:44.933
<v Speaker 1>I'd never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never read anything that heidegger </v>

1479
01:22:46.351 --> 01:22:47.610
<v Speaker 1>had written.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although you know,</v>

1480
01:22:47.611 --> 01:22:48.444
<v Speaker 1>his influences wormed its way into many </v>
<v Speaker 1>fields and I undoubtedly picked up some </v>

1481
01:22:52.321 --> 01:22:55.320
<v Speaker 1>of his ideas because they get embedded </v>
<v Speaker 1>in other places,</v>

1482
01:22:55.321 --> 01:22:56.154
<v Speaker 1>but certainly one of heidegger's claims </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the western philosophy got off on </v>

1483
01:23:00.301 --> 01:23:04.860
<v Speaker 1>the wrong foot right at the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he didn't study being it started</v>

1484
01:23:04.861 --> 01:23:05.694
<v Speaker 1>to think about thought and what's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>real issue is being and what is being </v>

1485
01:23:10.210 --> 01:23:14.400
<v Speaker 1>well being is what you experience and </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the high to ian's.</v>

1486
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:16.390
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's realIty.</v>

1487
01:23:16.450 --> 01:23:20.500
<v Speaker 1>There isn't a reality underneath that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now requires a real shift in perspective</v>

1488
01:23:20.530 --> 01:23:21.363
<v Speaker 1>to start to try to think that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the easiest way to do it is </v>

1489
01:23:24.161 --> 01:23:25.840
<v Speaker 1>to think both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1490
01:23:25.841 --> 01:23:26.674
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you think like a newtonian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair enough and then other times you </v>

1491
01:23:29.531 --> 01:23:31.390
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you need to know when to think.</v>

1492
01:23:31.391 --> 01:23:32.224
<v Speaker 1>Like an antonio and when to think like </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who understands that the </v>

1493
01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:37.473
<v Speaker 1>phenomena of meaning that surround us </v>
<v Speaker 1>are legitimate and it's a very </v>

1494
01:23:42.251 --> 01:23:43.084
<v Speaker 1>interesting thing and this is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that's really driven me through </v>

1495
01:23:45.821 --> 01:23:46.654
<v Speaker 1>this material is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we can make a case that like lord or </v>

1496
01:23:51.671 --> 01:23:52.504
<v Speaker 1>meanings are real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you perceive a bear or a cliff </v>

1497
01:23:55.751 --> 01:24:00.400
<v Speaker 1>as a threat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's so you don't die.</v>

1498
01:24:00.401 --> 01:24:01.234
<v Speaker 1>And it's worked really well for things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have been chased by bears for ever </v>

1499
01:24:03.641 --> 01:24:06.940
<v Speaker 1>since there's been bears and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and wavy before that.</v>

1500
01:24:07.570 --> 01:24:08.403
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's another question that </v>

1501
01:24:11.951 --> 01:24:12.671
<v Speaker 1>emerges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1502
01:24:12.671 --> 01:24:13.504
<v Speaker 1>so here's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got all these underlying </v>

1503
01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:17.343
<v Speaker 1>motivational systems that are built into</v>
<v Speaker 1>you as a consequence of evolutionary </v>

1504
01:24:21.161 --> 01:24:21.994
<v Speaker 1>processes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say it's your body and the </v>

1505
01:24:23.861 --> 01:24:27.700
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of your body in your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your brain and your mind,</v>

1506
01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:28.990
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's your,</v>

1507
01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:31.600
<v Speaker 1>it's your basic mammalian wiring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's been.</v>

1508
01:24:31.630 --> 01:24:34.720
<v Speaker 1>You'd been working on that ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've had nervous system's a very,</v>

1509
01:24:34.721 --> 01:24:37.420
<v Speaker 1>very long period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that sets you up.</v>

1510
01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:40.960
<v Speaker 1>Now you have to add complexity to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1511
01:24:40.961 --> 01:24:41.794
<v Speaker 1>Because when you're trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or because those systems only have a </v>

1512
01:24:46.151 --> 01:24:49.120
<v Speaker 1>finite time range,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when you're angry,</v>

1513
01:24:49.450 --> 01:24:52.300
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're angry right now and in fact,</v>

1514
01:24:52.301 --> 01:24:53.134
<v Speaker 1>part of the utility of angry is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's right now because it's a problem </v>

1515
01:24:55.931 --> 01:24:56.764
<v Speaker 1>solving mechanism for dealing with some </v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacle that you can't get rid of any </v>

1516
01:24:59.771 --> 01:25:02.140
<v Speaker 1>other way than to say to hell with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>

1517
01:25:02.141 --> 01:25:04.420
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking and deal with it right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1518
01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:05.313
<v Speaker 1>Now it's dangerous obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also necessary because </v>

1519
01:25:08.141 --> 01:25:08.974
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you get locked into an argument </v>

1520
01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:13.330
<v Speaker 1>and you just stand there arguing for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of your life.</v>

1521
01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:14.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at some point you say,</v>

1522
01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:15.873
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking to you anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the anger does that makes you </v>

1523
01:25:17.921 --> 01:25:19.930
<v Speaker 1>impulsive and you can walk away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1524
01:25:19.931 --> 01:25:22.600
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes that's the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusion to an argument.</v>

1525
01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:25.120
<v Speaker 1>You don't get a when you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep arguing.</v>

1526
01:25:25.121 --> 01:25:27.820
<v Speaker 1>So why do you stop?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get annoyed.</v>

1527
01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:28.953
<v Speaker 1>It's a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got all these basic biological </v>

1528
01:25:31.451 --> 01:25:32.284
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now obviously no one of them has that </v>

1529
01:25:34.691 --> 01:25:36.880
<v Speaker 1>answer and you know that because if it </v>
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>

1530
01:25:36.881 --> 01:25:39.670
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't need a bunch of them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a whole bunch of them.</v>

1531
01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:40.773
<v Speaker 1>You have pain and anxiety and </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration and play and sexuality and </v>

1532
01:25:44.351 --> 01:25:49.300
<v Speaker 1>hunger and thirst and you know you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>come up with probably 12 basic emotional</v>

1533
01:25:49.301 --> 01:25:50.590
<v Speaker 1>and motivational systems.</v>

1534
01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:52.593
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you need all 12 of those in order to </v>

1535
01:25:54.401 --> 01:25:57.610
<v Speaker 1>orient yourself properly in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like you need your five senses,</v>

1536
01:25:57.820 --> 01:26:01.780
<v Speaker 1>but then another problem starts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerge in that problem is okay,</v>

1537
01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:05.420
<v Speaker 1>those things have to be regulated </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>

1538
01:26:05.421 --> 01:26:06.254
<v Speaker 1>but they have to be regulated across </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple spans of time and then they </v>

1539
01:26:10.551 --> 01:26:11.384
<v Speaker 1>have to be regulated across multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>different complexities of social </v>

1540
01:26:14.961 --> 01:26:17.720
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't just have one system of 12.</v>

1541
01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Now you have a very large number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cyst,</v>

1542
01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:25.370
<v Speaker 1>so 12 for very long spans of time and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you think,</v>

1543
01:26:25.371 --> 01:26:26.204
<v Speaker 1>well out of that emerges a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about that already with the </v>

1544
01:26:29.871 --> 01:26:32.210
<v Speaker 1>evolution of games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Out of that emerges a solution.</v>

1545
01:26:32.450 --> 01:26:35.150
<v Speaker 1>You might think about those as higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>order meanings.</v>

1546
01:26:35.810 --> 01:26:36.643
<v Speaker 1>So when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that and you do it and you </v>

1547
01:26:38.241 --> 01:26:39.920
<v Speaker 1>believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

1548
01:26:39.921 --> 01:26:40.490
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

1549
01:26:40.490 --> 01:26:41.323
<v Speaker 1>So here you are in university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you ask yourself why you might </v>

1550
01:26:44.571 --> 01:26:44.901
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1551
01:26:44.901 --> 01:26:47.870
<v Speaker 1>what do you have to believe in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be in university?</v>

1552
01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:49.573
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at some point your beliefs run out and </v>

1553
01:26:53.421 --> 01:26:55.430
<v Speaker 1>you're just here because you've made </v>
<v Speaker 1>that decision.</v>

1554
01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:56.720
<v Speaker 1>But I could ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1555
01:26:56.780 --> 01:26:57.613
<v Speaker 1>why are you were in university and most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have about five reasons and then </v>

1556
01:27:00.501 --> 01:27:02.030
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they don't know what to say.</v>

1557
01:27:02.690 --> 01:27:03.523
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that means is they have reason a </v>

1558
01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:06.513
<v Speaker 1>and reasonably and reasons see and </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonably and then they're just acting </v>

1559
01:27:08.781 --> 01:27:11.930
<v Speaker 1>it out after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you keep questioning them,</v>

1560
01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:14.570
<v Speaker 1>they get perturbed and they'll get </v>
<v Speaker 1>annoyed.</v>

1561
01:27:14.571 --> 01:27:16.790
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they'll cry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they'll get angry.</v>

1562
01:27:16.850 --> 01:27:18.590
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're ready to go in after </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's like,</v>

1563
01:27:18.591 --> 01:27:20.900
<v Speaker 1>what the hell are you up to and why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1564
01:27:21.050 --> 01:27:23.870
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you have to do that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>untangle something very complex.</v>

1565
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:28.520
<v Speaker 1>At some point people just get angry or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they cry and that means to hell with you</v>

1566
01:27:28.521 --> 01:27:30.620
<v Speaker 1>or you're bullying me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave me alone.</v>

1567
01:27:30.621 --> 01:27:32.240
<v Speaker 1>And that's supposed to get rid of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1568
01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:35.600
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't work if you really want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get down to the answer.</v>

1569
01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:36.493
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly what we're trying to figure out </v>

1570
01:27:37.701 --> 01:27:39.830
<v Speaker 1>is why the hell are you in university?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1571
01:27:39.831 --> 01:27:40.551
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1572
01:27:40.551 --> 01:27:42.350
<v Speaker 1>to get a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I might say,</v>

1573
01:27:42.351 --> 01:27:43.184
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why in the world would that make you </v>

1574
01:27:43.731 --> 01:27:45.520
<v Speaker 1>satisfied with life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1575
01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:47.840
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think that would make you </v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfied with life?</v>

1576
01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:49.011
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1577
01:27:49.011 --> 01:27:50.750
<v Speaker 1>it's better than not having a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1578
01:27:50.751 --> 01:27:51.111
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1579
01:27:51.111 --> 01:27:52.760
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1580
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:56.630
<v Speaker 1>let's not forget the practical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't the solution.</v>

1581
01:27:57.770 --> 01:28:00.680
<v Speaker 1>It's part of asp solution and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question is,</v>

1582
01:28:00.681 --> 01:28:04.790
<v Speaker 1>do you really believe that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution while you might ask because you</v>

1583
01:28:04.791 --> 01:28:05.624
<v Speaker 1>believe it enough so that you're here </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you believe that has something </v>

1584
01:28:08.421 --> 01:28:10.820
<v Speaker 1>to do with the ability to think and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

1585
01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:11.713
<v Speaker 1>You believe that that has something to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do with the necessity of understanding </v>

1586
01:28:14.211 --> 01:28:16.780
<v Speaker 1>your history and you believe that it has</v>
<v Speaker 1>something to do with the,</v>

1587
01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:20.660
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the utility of exposing yourself to</v>

1588
01:28:20.661 --> 01:28:24.260
<v Speaker 1>what in principle are great rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Historical and literary works.</v>

1589
01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:28.670
<v Speaker 1>You assume that that's all valid because</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's implicitly,</v>

1590
01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:29.733
<v Speaker 1>if it's implicitly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just means you're imitating someone </v>

1591
01:28:31.251 --> 01:28:33.770
<v Speaker 1>who assumes all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but either way,</v>

1592
01:28:33.771 --> 01:28:35.240
<v Speaker 1>here you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing something.</v>

1593
01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:37.440
<v Speaker 1>And the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe this is the credit,</v>

1594
01:28:37.490 --> 01:28:39.980
<v Speaker 1>I think this was the critical question </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the 20th century.</v>

1595
01:28:41.810 --> 01:28:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Is there any reality to what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing or is it just arbitrary?</v>

1596
01:28:45.730 --> 01:28:47.630
<v Speaker 1>If it's arbitrary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1597
01:28:48.110 --> 01:28:48.943
<v Speaker 1>you know that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a path denialism because who </v>

1598
01:28:51.351 --> 01:28:52.970
<v Speaker 1>cares what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're your,</v>

1599
01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:54.223
<v Speaker 1>whatever you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're rude and you can make a strong </v>

1600
01:28:55.911 --> 01:28:56.870
<v Speaker 1>case for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1601
01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:00.080
<v Speaker 1>but the problem with that seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>that nihilism.</v>

1602
01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Try it for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1603
01:29:02.490 --> 01:29:03.323
<v Speaker 1>it's what it produces is misery and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people generally believe in misery and </v>

1604
01:29:08.551 --> 01:29:11.670
<v Speaker 1>they genuinely believed that it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good thing to have.</v>

1605
01:29:11.730 --> 01:29:14.370
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say nihilism is a self </v>
<v Speaker 1>defeating proposition.</v>

1606
01:29:14.490 --> 01:29:15.323
<v Speaker 1>If you assume that misery is actually a </v>
<v Speaker 1>source of valid information and you all </v>

1607
01:29:19.111 --> 01:29:20.520
<v Speaker 1>do because you know if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1608
01:29:20.590 --> 01:29:21.423
<v Speaker 1>if someone's jabbing you with the pen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to move your arm because </v>

1609
01:29:24.241 --> 01:29:26.790
<v Speaker 1>you feel that if you can avoid some </v>
<v Speaker 1>misery,</v>

1610
01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:27.833
<v Speaker 1>that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have faith in your experience at </v>

1611
01:29:30.481 --> 01:29:32.340
<v Speaker 1>that level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then you might say,</v>

1612
01:29:32.341 --> 01:29:33.810
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1613
01:29:33.811 --> 01:29:34.644
<v Speaker 1>if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can really make a solid case for </v>

1614
01:29:36.301 --> 01:29:39.570
<v Speaker 1>the believability of certain kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences that they're real,</v>

1615
01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:40.613
<v Speaker 1>why can't you make a case for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>believability of higher forms of </v>

1616
01:29:42.571 --> 01:29:44.730
<v Speaker 1>meaning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're not arbitrary,</v>

1617
01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:47.880
<v Speaker 1>we don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I tell you,</v>

1618
01:29:47.881 --> 01:29:50.070
<v Speaker 1>if you act like they're arbitrary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get into trouble very,</v>

1619
01:29:50.071 --> 01:29:53.730
<v Speaker 1>very rapid because you either become </v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic or halfway down the trip,</v>

1620
01:29:53.731 --> 01:29:54.960
<v Speaker 1>denial this nihilism.</v>

1621
01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:59.310
<v Speaker 1>You adopt some horrible etiology and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know you're possessed by it and</v>

1622
01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:02.250
<v Speaker 1>then you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you're,</v>

1623
01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:03.863
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to live your own life </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you'll live the life of the </v>

1624
01:30:06.031 --> 01:30:06.864
<v Speaker 1>ideology and you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous to everyone around you and </v>

1625
01:30:09.181 --> 01:30:12.150
<v Speaker 1>also impervious to any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable communication.</v>

1626
01:30:12.151 --> 01:30:12.984
<v Speaker 1>So if those are the two consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 1>making the presumption of arbitrary </v>

1627
01:30:16.861 --> 01:30:17.694
<v Speaker 1>meaning at a higher order level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then to me they've invalidated </v>

1628
01:30:20.071 --> 01:30:22.590
<v Speaker 1>themselves already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've already had that experiment,</v>

1629
01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:25.560
<v Speaker 1>it didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then the question is,</v>

1630
01:30:25.561 --> 01:30:26.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's next?</v>

1631
01:30:26.730 --> 01:30:27.563
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's partly what we're trying to </v>

1632
01:30:28.051 --> 01:30:32.730
<v Speaker 1>figure out right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's take a break until 3:15.</v>
