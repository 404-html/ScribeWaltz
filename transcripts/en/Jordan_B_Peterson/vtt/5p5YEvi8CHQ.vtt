1
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.550
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing I want to show you is</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing called a golden board.</v>

2
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:07.613
<v Speaker 1>Now they have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was worked out by Francis Gulf </v>

3
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.170
<v Speaker 1>who's actually quite an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

4
00:00:13.171 --> 00:00:14.004
<v Speaker 1>You'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see if you hear about Francis </v>

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.733
<v Speaker 1>Galton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll often hear that he was the first </v>

6
00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:21.150
<v Speaker 1>person he tried to measure human </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

7
00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:21.984
<v Speaker 1>But that's actually not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What golden tried to do was measure </v>

8
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:28.830
<v Speaker 1>human eminence and he thought of eminent</v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

9
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.180
<v Speaker 1>I suppose something like high position </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the cultural dominance hierarchy.</v>

10
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.223
<v Speaker 1>And this was back in Victorian England </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the late 18 hundreds and so eminence </v>

11
00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:39.990
<v Speaker 1>would have been intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>achievement,</v>

12
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:42.250
<v Speaker 1>financial achievement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

13
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.760
<v Speaker 1>cultural achievement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>achievement,</v>

14
00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:45.594
<v Speaker 1>broadly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really considered within the </v>

15
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:50.850
<v Speaker 1>confines of a dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at that point in time,</v>

16
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.103
<v Speaker 1>the English regarded themselves as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prime nation and ethnicity on the </v>

17
00:00:57.541 --> 00:00:58.374
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the aristocratic Englishman </v>

18
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.863
<v Speaker 1>regarded themselves as the prime human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings in that prime country and </v>

19
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.730
<v Speaker 1>ethnicity.</v>

20
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.290
<v Speaker 1>And so it was really an idea that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be more associated with,</v>

21
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.173
<v Speaker 1>with dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>upper most dominant hierarchy position </v>

22
00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:17.970
<v Speaker 1>than anything we would conceptualize as </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence today.</v>

23
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.570
<v Speaker 1>And Goldberg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our golden was a polymath.</v>

24
00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:22.404
<v Speaker 1>He was a genius in many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many fields and got very interested in </v>

25
00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:28.190
<v Speaker 1>the idea of measuring human differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

26
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.993
<v Speaker 1>he tried to determine whether the </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences that he could measure in </v>

27
00:01:32.731 --> 00:01:35.040
<v Speaker 1>some of those things where like reaction</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and height and,</v>

28
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.710
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.190
<v Speaker 1>physical fitness and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

30
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.180
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember all the other things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he attempted to measure,</v>

31
00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:46.014
<v Speaker 1>but he wanted to see if any of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things could be used to predict </v>

32
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.260
<v Speaker 1>eminence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

33
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.133
<v Speaker 1>it turned out that they couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because eminence is not the kind </v>

34
00:01:57.931 --> 00:02:00.930
<v Speaker 1>of category that you can make into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific category.</v>

35
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.623
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and partly because his measurement </v>

36
00:02:04.021 --> 00:02:07.200
<v Speaker 1>instruments in many ways weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitive enough.</v>

37
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.033
<v Speaker 1>He didn't make enough measurements and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the statistics weren't sufficiently </v>

38
00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:11.634
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that you could measure </v>

39
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.653
<v Speaker 1>elementary attributes and that you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>use them to predict something important </v>

40
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.793
<v Speaker 1>was still an important idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's one of those examples in </v>

41
00:02:22.861 --> 00:02:24.540
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of like phrenology.</v>

42
00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:26.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean everyone makes fun of phrenology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

43
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.893
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you could read someone's </v>

44
00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:34.200
<v Speaker 1>character by mapping out the protrusions</v>
<v Speaker 1>and depths and so forth on the,</v>

45
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.690
<v Speaker 1>on their skull,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds</v>

46
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.790
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous to modern ears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was,</v>

47
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:42.624
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was some idea behind it and that </v>

48
00:02:43.471 --> 00:02:44.304
<v Speaker 1>was the idea that critical functions </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be localized and that cognitive </v>

49
00:02:47.611 --> 00:02:50.670
<v Speaker 1>functions could be differentiated into </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate functions.</v>

50
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.670
<v Speaker 1>We still do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think of emotions and motivations and</v>

51
00:02:53.671 --> 00:02:56.130
<v Speaker 1>personality traits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And intelligence is,</v>

52
00:02:56.131 --> 00:02:58.860
<v Speaker 1>even though intelligence is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not a very good idea,</v>

53
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.950
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you can differentiate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

54
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.240
<v Speaker 1>human psychological function and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be related in some way to the</v>

55
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:10.480
<v Speaker 1>underlying neurological and physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>architecture.</v>

56
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.673
<v Speaker 1>That's not a stupid idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So an idea can be very intelligent at </v>

57
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:16.700
<v Speaker 1>one level of analysis and not so </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent that the others.</v>

58
00:03:16.701 --> 00:03:17.534
<v Speaker 1>So I would say the problem with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenologist was actually a problem of </v>

59
00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:22.900
<v Speaker 1>operationalization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had the theory right in some sense,</v>

60
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.900
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't have the measures right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

61
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 1>now one of the things Bolton who came up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with was the normal,</v>

62
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 1>he came up with this thing called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>golden board.</v>

63
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.670
<v Speaker 1>And a golden board demonstrates how a </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal distribution is produced.</v>

64
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 1>Now basically what the normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution is a,</v>

65
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.943
<v Speaker 1>an axiomatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an axiom of modern statistics and </v>

66
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:47.703
<v Speaker 1>every system has to have its axioms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the axiom of normal distribution is </v>

67
00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:54.244
<v Speaker 1>basically the idea that around any </v>
<v Speaker 1>measurement there's going to be a set </v>

68
00:03:57.411 --> 00:03:58.244
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be variations in </v>

69
00:03:59.081 --> 00:04:02.560
<v Speaker 1>measurement and those measurements are </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically going to be random.</v>

70
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:03.663
<v Speaker 1>And then another axiom is that extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>outlying measurements are going to be </v>

71
00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:11.680
<v Speaker 1>rare and small outlying measurements are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be more common.</v>

72
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:13.210
<v Speaker 1>So you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

73
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.800
<v Speaker 1>if I measured any one of you a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>times with,</v>

74
00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:18.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

75
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:20.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say with a tape measure,</v>

76
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get a set of variables that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not always exactly the same.</v>

77
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:25.653
<v Speaker 1>And so there'll be an average and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be some deviation around that </v>

78
00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:29.074
<v Speaker 1>average.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I looked at a hundred </v>

79
00:04:30.431 --> 00:04:32.680
<v Speaker 1>measurements that I took of each of one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of you,</v>

80
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.020
<v Speaker 1>then I would get a normal distribution </v>
<v Speaker 1>around that,</v>

81
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.243
<v Speaker 1>that distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's sort of the fuzziness of the </v>

82
00:04:38.771 --> 00:04:39.604
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that might be partly because my </v>

83
00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:43.990
<v Speaker 1>measurement instrument isn't very </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate.</v>

84
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.063
<v Speaker 1>It might be partly because at some point</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're being measured for the 50th </v>

85
00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:49.714
<v Speaker 1>time you're slouching a little bit or </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe other times you standing up a bit </v>

86
00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:52.654
<v Speaker 1>straighter or maybe I measure you in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning sometimes and in the evening at </v>

87
00:04:56.081 --> 00:04:56.590
<v Speaker 1>other times.</v>

88
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.620
<v Speaker 1>If you're actually taller in the morning</v>
<v Speaker 1>than you are in the evening because your</v>

89
00:04:59.621 --> 00:05:01.570
<v Speaker 1>spine has a chance to decompress at </v>
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>

90
00:05:01.571 --> 00:05:04.240
<v Speaker 1>so maybe that adds half an inch to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>height in the morning.</v>

91
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.133
<v Speaker 1>And so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be shifting and </v>

92
00:05:06.491 --> 00:05:07.324
<v Speaker 1>movement around the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the central tendency around the </v>

93
00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:11.860
<v Speaker 1>average.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if I turns out,</v>

94
00:05:11.861 --> 00:05:14.890
<v Speaker 1>if I measure all of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing's going to happen.</v>

95
00:05:14.891 --> 00:05:16.660
<v Speaker 1>What we're going to get is an average </v>
<v Speaker 1>height,</v>

96
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.630
<v Speaker 1>which would be the average height of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in this room,</v>

97
00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:20.464
<v Speaker 1>and then there's going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution had basically a normal </v>

98
00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:23.044
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those of you who are much taller than </v>

99
00:05:25.271 --> 00:05:26.104
<v Speaker 1>the average are going to be much fewer </v>
<v Speaker 1>than those of you that are close to the </v>

100
00:05:29.021 --> 00:05:29.854
<v Speaker 1>average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those of you that are much shorter </v>

101
00:05:31.361 --> 00:05:32.194
<v Speaker 1>than the average are going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be far fewer of you </v>

102
00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:35.080
<v Speaker 1>than there are going to be.</v>

103
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Those of you who are just somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>smaller than the average.</v>

104
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.933
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally the idea of a normal </v>

105
00:05:41.951 --> 00:05:46.951
<v Speaker 1>distribution is predicated on the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the variation around the average is</v>

106
00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:48.274
<v Speaker 1>actually random and that's an important </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing because the variation around that </v>

107
00:05:52.241 --> 00:05:56.230
<v Speaker 1>average is not always random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

108
00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:57.064
<v Speaker 1>psychologists will tell you and and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>what most social scientists who use </v>

109
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:04.550
<v Speaker 1>classical statistics that the normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution is the norm.</v>

110
00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:05.384
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe they'll say more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it's the standard case that </v>

111
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:09.284
<v Speaker 1>whatever set of variables you measure is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to come out in a normal </v>

112
00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:14.960
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means that you can apply all of</v>

113
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:15.794
<v Speaker 1>the stats that you're going to learn to </v>
<v Speaker 1>decompose the world and reconstruct it </v>

114
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.470
<v Speaker 1>to your data sets because the data sets </v>
<v Speaker 1>will fit the assumptions of the,</v>

115
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.010
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

116
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.420
<v Speaker 1>statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that is that it's often</v>

117
00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:30.254
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

118
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.393
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked you guys to buy the Black Swan </v>

119
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.580
<v Speaker 1>and we haven't talked about the black </v>
<v Speaker 1>swan much yet,</v>

120
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:40.370
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not going to test you on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would recommend that you,</v>

121
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:41.623
<v Speaker 1>that you read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're interested in </v>

122
00:06:43.341 --> 00:06:46.700
<v Speaker 1>psychology because you gotta watch your </v>
<v Speaker 1>axioms.</v>

123
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.360
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that the normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution might not always be correct</v>

124
00:06:50.361 --> 00:06:53.510
<v Speaker 1>and certainly might not be a correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>description of your data,</v>

125
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.290
<v Speaker 1>is a fundamentally important idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if it's wrong,</v>

126
00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:59.090
<v Speaker 1>if your doubt isn't normally </v>
<v Speaker 1>distributed,</v>

127
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.193
<v Speaker 1>then the phenomena that you're looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>at isn't what you think it is and the </v>

128
00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:04.820
<v Speaker 1>statistics that you're going to use </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't going to work.</v>

129
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.223
<v Speaker 1>Now this came as quite a puzzle to me at</v>
<v Speaker 1>one point because it turned out that </v>

130
00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:09.824
<v Speaker 1>when we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we produced the creative </v>

131
00:07:11.811 --> 00:07:14.330
<v Speaker 1>achievement questionnaire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

132
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:16.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

133
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.200
<v Speaker 1>and you'd think I would've known better </v>
<v Speaker 1>if by this time,</v>

134
00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:19.610
<v Speaker 1>cause it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't that long ago.</v>

135
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.240
<v Speaker 1>It was like 15 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The data never came back,</v>

136
00:07:23.241 --> 00:07:24.074
<v Speaker 1>normally distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It came back distributed enough in that </v>

137
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.553
<v Speaker 1>what they call a pareto distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is everyone stacks up on the </v>

138
00:07:30.741 --> 00:07:34.610
<v Speaker 1>lefthand side and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the curve drifts off to the right.</v>

139
00:07:34.611 --> 00:07:35.444
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of those curves where </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost everyone has zero or one and a </v>

140
00:07:39.081 --> 00:07:41.390
<v Speaker 1>smaller minority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have very high scores.</v>

141
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:42.913
<v Speaker 1>Now when you get a prieto distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something going on that's not </v>

142
00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:47.960
<v Speaker 1>random and that doesn't mean you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignore it.</v>

143
00:07:47.961 --> 00:07:48.794
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that psychologists </v>

144
00:07:49.551 --> 00:07:50.384
<v Speaker 1>will do sometimes if they get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution that's not random is </v>

145
00:07:53.151 --> 00:07:53.984
<v Speaker 1>they'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And mathematical transformation like a </v>

146
00:07:55.461 --> 00:08:00.200
<v Speaker 1>log rhythmic transformation to pull in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the outliers and to try to make the data</v>

147
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.090
<v Speaker 1>fit the normal distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

148
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:03.403
<v Speaker 1>assuming that there's some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>measurement error there or that the </v>

149
00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:07.760
<v Speaker 1>scales got a logarithmic function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

150
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.073
<v Speaker 1>it isn't always obvious that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful and appropriate thing to do </v>

151
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.293
<v Speaker 1>because it's the case in many situations</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the extremeness of the </v>

152
00:08:20.571 --> 00:08:23.230
<v Speaker 1>distribution is actually an accurate </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of,</v>

153
00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.390
<v Speaker 1>of the way that that phenomena behaves </v>
<v Speaker 1>in nature.</v>

154
00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.750
<v Speaker 1>Now I want to show you how a normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution works.</v>

155
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:30.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

156
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.023
<v Speaker 1>have you ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have any of you ever seen a </v>

157
00:08:34.041 --> 00:08:34.874
<v Speaker 1>demonstration of why a normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution is normal in why it takes </v>

158
00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:41.750
<v Speaker 1>the shape it takes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does anybody ever seen that?</v>

159
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:43.243
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird day because you think that </v>

160
00:08:44.241 --> 00:08:45.074
<v Speaker 1>given it's unbelievable importance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in psychology where </v>

161
00:08:47.511 --> 00:08:51.080
<v Speaker 1>everything we do is measured and has an </v>
<v Speaker 1>average in a standard deviation,</v>

162
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:54.830
<v Speaker 1>that there'd be some investigation into </v>
<v Speaker 1>why we make that presupposition.</v>

163
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.183
<v Speaker 1>There's a great book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One Book I would recommend for those of </v>

164
00:08:58.801 --> 00:09:00.900
<v Speaker 1>you who might be interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology is a career.</v>

165
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:03.360
<v Speaker 1>There's a book called a history of </v>
<v Speaker 1>statistical thinking.</v>

166
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.180
<v Speaker 1>Now you'd think Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's not anything more boring than</v>

167
00:09:06.181 --> 00:09:09.000
<v Speaker 1>statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be the history of statistics.</v>

168
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.310
<v Speaker 1>But it turns out that that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

169
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.593
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of statistics is actually </v>

170
00:09:13.711 --> 00:09:17.100
<v Speaker 1>the history of the social sciences and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not only of the social sciences,</v>

171
00:09:17.101 --> 00:09:17.934
<v Speaker 1>because statistics became not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistics was actually initially </v>

172
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:26.040
<v Speaker 1>invented by cosmologists who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>measuring planetary position.</v>

173
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.413
<v Speaker 1>And then the statistical processes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been used to underpin modern </v>

174
00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:34.050
<v Speaker 1>science have been tossed back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weirdly enough,</v>

175
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.070
<v Speaker 1>between social scientists and physicists</v>
<v Speaker 1>over about the last 200 years.</v>

176
00:09:38.071 --> 00:09:42.720
<v Speaker 1>Because the physicists ended up having </v>
<v Speaker 1>to describe the world from a statistical</v>

177
00:09:42.721 --> 00:09:43.590
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

178
00:09:43.591 --> 00:09:47.430
<v Speaker 1>Because if you go down into the realm of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the atomic and subatomic particles,</v>

179
00:09:47.431 --> 00:09:50.040
<v Speaker 1>what you find is that things behave </v>
<v Speaker 1>statistically down there.</v>

180
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:54.060
<v Speaker 1>They don't behave deterministically and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same at the level of the,</v>

181
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.370
<v Speaker 1>of the human scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

182
00:09:56.371 --> 00:09:58.650
<v Speaker 1>we behave statistically not </v>
<v Speaker 1>deterministically.</v>

183
00:09:58.651 --> 00:09:59.484
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you hear this old idea that </v>

184
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:04.290
<v Speaker 1>that psychology has physics envy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

185
00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:05.124
<v Speaker 1>But it turned out that for much of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>history of the development of </v>

186
00:10:08.101 --> 00:10:11.070
<v Speaker 1>statistical ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physics had psychology envy,</v>

187
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.040
<v Speaker 1>which I think is quite funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

188
00:10:14.041 --> 00:10:14.874
<v Speaker 1>if you look at this book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>historic history of statistical </v>

189
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:18.143
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see how the idea that </v>

190
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:22.043
<v Speaker 1>populations could have behavior in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>populations could be measured and that </v>

191
00:10:25.471 --> 00:10:26.304
<v Speaker 1>the idea that states like political </v>
<v Speaker 1>states could be measured and that human </v>

192
00:10:29.371 --> 00:10:30.690
<v Speaker 1>behavior could be measured.</v>

193
00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:34.440
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't realize until I wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read this book that,</v>

194
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:37.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how revolutionary the idea of statistics</v>

195
00:10:37.741 --> 00:10:40.770
<v Speaker 1>actually was because of course it's part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the idea of measurement.</v>

196
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.970
<v Speaker 1>So I had this very interesting client at</v>
<v Speaker 1>one point,</v>

197
00:10:44.971 --> 00:10:48.190
<v Speaker 1>he was an old guy and he'd been a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist and that finance,</v>

198
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.180
<v Speaker 1>you're anna statistician and he was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>love with mathematics.</v>

199
00:10:51.181 --> 00:10:52.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was one of these guys who,</v>

200
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.800
<v Speaker 1>who for whom mathematical equations had </v>
<v Speaker 1>this immediate glimmer of beauty.</v>

201
00:10:59.641 --> 00:11:00.474
<v Speaker 1>And he made this very interesting little</v>
<v Speaker 1>gold sculpture that I have up at my </v>

202
00:11:02.791 --> 00:11:03.624
<v Speaker 1>office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's a representation of what </v>

203
00:11:05.671 --> 00:11:10.020
<v Speaker 1>people claim to be the most perfect </v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematical equation ever constructed.</v>

204
00:11:10.021 --> 00:11:10.854
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we made this little gadgets like a </v>

205
00:11:12.391 --> 00:11:13.990
<v Speaker 1>religious icon almost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

206
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.990
<v Speaker 1>and that's really what he thought of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

207
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:17.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

208
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:21.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid foolishly enough that I can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you the name of the equation.</v>

209
00:11:21.571 --> 00:11:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Some of you might know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

210
00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:27.120
<v Speaker 1>it relates I e and Pi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there anybody in here who yes.</v>

211
00:11:27.121 --> 00:11:30.490
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

212
00:11:30.491 --> 00:11:35.491
<v Speaker 1>And what is that equation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

213
00:11:36.621 --> 00:11:37.480
<v Speaker 1>And do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>

214
00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:40.000
<v Speaker 1>do you know why it's such a remarkable </v>
<v Speaker 1>equations?</v>

215
00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.560
<v Speaker 2>I won</v>

216
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:45.570
<v Speaker 1>in one equation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

217
00:11:45.571 --> 00:11:49.500
<v Speaker 1>So he thought that that in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>this equation summed up the magnificence</v>

218
00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:50.334
<v Speaker 1>of the mathematical universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it was so funny cause he also </v>

219
00:11:52.771 --> 00:11:54.910
<v Speaker 1>made little pins that people could wear </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this,</v>

220
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.070
<v Speaker 1>of this equation that we are also made </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of gold.</v>

221
00:11:57.071 --> 00:12:01.090
<v Speaker 1>And there was another person in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>department at that point and uh,</v>

222
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.160
<v Speaker 1>I was wearing this pin around and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

223
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.420
<v Speaker 1>oh well she told me what the equation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she pointed,</v>

224
00:12:05.421 --> 00:12:06.254
<v Speaker 1>you did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she got all excited because it was </v>

225
00:12:07.211 --> 00:12:08.044
<v Speaker 1>this perfect equation that related all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these fundamental constants to one and </v>

226
00:12:10.361 --> 00:12:12.640
<v Speaker 1>zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

227
00:12:12.641 --> 00:12:15.040
<v Speaker 1>he taught me a lot of this while he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a client of mine.</v>

228
00:12:15.041 --> 00:12:18.070
<v Speaker 1>He was very much obsessed with Matt </v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematical ideas.</v>

229
00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:18.904
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't get them out of his head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a true obsession and a useful </v>

230
00:12:21.461 --> 00:12:22.120
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

231
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:22.953
<v Speaker 1>But he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he taught me a lot of things about </v>

232
00:12:24.281 --> 00:12:26.170
<v Speaker 1>statistics that I just never knew it </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

233
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.393
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

234
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.040
<v Speaker 1>one of them was the prieto distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would just,</v>

235
00:12:33.041 --> 00:12:34.780
<v Speaker 1>it just staggered me that I didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

236
00:12:34.781 --> 00:12:36.820
<v Speaker 1>I only learned this stuff about five or </v>
<v Speaker 1>six years ago,</v>

237
00:12:36.821 --> 00:12:39.160
<v Speaker 1>and it just made me feel like a complete</v>
<v Speaker 1>moron because I've,</v>

238
00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone through men,</v>

239
00:12:41.201 --> 00:12:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Manz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manz,</v>

240
00:12:42.191 --> 00:12:43.024
<v Speaker 1>mother's psychological training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was measuring things like </v>

241
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.490
<v Speaker 1>prefrontal ability and intelligence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality and creativity.</v>

242
00:12:48.491 --> 00:12:49.324
<v Speaker 1>And then in the creativity measurement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stumbled into these prieto </v>

243
00:12:51.311 --> 00:12:53.350
<v Speaker 1>distributions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought they were bloodied mistake.</v>

244
00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.070
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what the hell they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

245
00:12:55.071 --> 00:12:55.904
<v Speaker 1>when I've also found economists who </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know about the credo </v>

246
00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:59.830
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty bloody bizarre thing,</v>

247
00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:03.310
<v Speaker 1>like it really is a strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

248
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.900
<v Speaker 1>one of the things he showed me is how </v>
<v Speaker 1>the normal distribution comes about.</v>

249
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:08.740
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

250
00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:12.070
<v Speaker 1>I had a student who did a phd thesis on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gulfton,</v>

251
00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.260
<v Speaker 1>so I knew something about golden at this</v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

252
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.290
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was doing a part of his thesis on the</v>

253
00:13:17.291 --> 00:13:19.210
<v Speaker 1>history of the measurement of </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

254
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.433
<v Speaker 1>And a golden was a key figure in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishment of that sort of </v>

255
00:13:23.741 --> 00:13:24.574
<v Speaker 1>measurement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

256
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.633
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is one of the things gotten </v>

257
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:29.920
<v Speaker 1>invented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's take a look at it here.</v>

258
00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:56.223
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's your basic rock and roll </v>

259
00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:02.890
<v Speaker 1>golden board apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me show you a picture of,</v>

260
00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:08.070
<v Speaker 1>of a golf board so you'd get a better </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of exactly what is doing.</v>

261
00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.173
<v Speaker 1>So there's a good one right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if we can make that a little </v>

262
00:15:15.431 --> 00:15:17.560
<v Speaker 1>bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

263
00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:21.490
<v Speaker 1>So basically all that happens within </v>
<v Speaker 1>Goldman board is that you have a,</v>

264
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:23.743
<v Speaker 1>you got a bunch of pains on a board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the board is horizontal and you </v>

265
00:15:27.021 --> 00:15:27.854
<v Speaker 1>dropped balls down at marbles or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is and the marbles come in </v>

266
00:15:30.771 --> 00:15:35.480
<v Speaker 1>one place and then they bounced down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pins and they distribute themselves in a</v>

267
00:15:35.481 --> 00:15:37.220
<v Speaker 1>normal distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

268
00:15:37.221 --> 00:15:38.054
<v Speaker 1>the reason they do that is because there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are far more ways of getting down the </v>

269
00:15:41.001 --> 00:15:43.190
<v Speaker 1>middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there are of getting either side.</v>

270
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:44.623
<v Speaker 1>Now you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because to get to the only to the right </v>

271
00:15:47.751 --> 00:15:49.370
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say the ball has to go write,</v>

272
00:15:49.371 --> 00:15:49.851
<v Speaker 1>write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write,</v>

273
00:15:49.851 --> 00:15:50.361
<v Speaker 1>write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write,</v>

274
00:15:50.361 --> 00:15:50.841
<v Speaker 1>write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write,</v>

275
00:15:50.841 --> 00:15:51.674
<v Speaker 1>write and then fall in the Little Cup </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then on the left it has to do </v>

276
00:15:55.071 --> 00:15:56.120
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same thing.</v>

277
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.820
<v Speaker 1>There's only one way it can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

278
00:15:58.821 --> 00:16:01.010
<v Speaker 1>But to get into the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can go left,</v>

279
00:16:01.011 --> 00:16:01.581
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

280
00:16:01.581 --> 00:16:02.181
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

281
00:16:02.181 --> 00:16:02.780
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

282
00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:04.220
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

283
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:06.830
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a far greater number of pathways</v>

284
00:16:06.831 --> 00:16:08.780
<v Speaker 1>for the ball to go from the middle down </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the middle.</v>

285
00:16:08.781 --> 00:16:10.550
<v Speaker 1>Then there is for the bowl to go to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sites.</v>

286
00:16:10.551 --> 00:16:11.384
<v Speaker 1>And so all that means fundamentally is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the probability that a given ball </v>

287
00:16:14.691 --> 00:16:15.524
<v Speaker 1>is going to land in the middle or near </v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle is much higher than the </v>

288
00:16:17.661 --> 00:16:20.600
<v Speaker 1>probability that a ball is going to land</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the extremes.</v>

289
00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:21.913
<v Speaker 1>And so it's just a description of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>random processes laid themselves out </v>

290
00:16:24.981 --> 00:16:26.840
<v Speaker 1>around a mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

291
00:16:26.841 --> 00:16:27.674
<v Speaker 1>so that's a normal distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if you have normal distribution one </v>

292
00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:35.360
<v Speaker 1>and you have normal distribution to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can overlap them.</v>

293
00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:36.733
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they overlap perfectly the mean </v>

294
00:16:38.631 --> 00:16:42.650
<v Speaker 1>and the standard deviation or the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's nothing different about,</v>

295
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:43.873
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause one thing you want to ask as well </v>

296
00:16:44.691 --> 00:16:46.970
<v Speaker 1>are how do you know if two means are </v>
<v Speaker 1>different?</v>

297
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:47.803
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is you don't know unless </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what the means are measuring </v>

298
00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:50.653
<v Speaker 1>and you don't know what the means are </v>
<v Speaker 1>measuring unless you know the variation </v>

299
00:16:53.061 --> 00:16:53.894
<v Speaker 1>of the measurement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to know what the mean </v>

300
00:16:56.001 --> 00:16:56.834
<v Speaker 1>and the standard deviation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the standard deviation is like the </v>

301
00:16:58.671 --> 00:17:03.671
<v Speaker 1>width of the meme in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all statistics do generally take one</v>

302
00:17:03.851 --> 00:17:04.684
<v Speaker 1>normal distribution and another and slap</v>
<v Speaker 1>them on top of each other and then </v>

303
00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:10.083
<v Speaker 1>measure how far apart they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much they overlap and correct that </v>

304
00:17:13.481 --> 00:17:14.314
<v Speaker 1>for the sample size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can tell if the two </v>

305
00:17:16.811 --> 00:17:19.240
<v Speaker 1>distributions are different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>significantly different.</v>

306
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:20.223
<v Speaker 1>So what you would do is you'd run a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole bunch of normal distribution </v>

307
00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:23.373
<v Speaker 1>processes by chance and you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a distribution of distributions in </v>

308
00:17:27.761 --> 00:17:28.594
<v Speaker 1>some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can tell what the </v>

309
00:17:30.071 --> 00:17:34.270
<v Speaker 1>probability is that the normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution that you drew for group aid</v>

310
00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.510
<v Speaker 1>is the same as the normal distribution </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you drew for group B.</v>

311
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:38.733
<v Speaker 1>And that's all there is basically to s </v>
<v Speaker 1>two standard group comparison </v>

312
00:17:41.891 --> 00:17:42.820
<v Speaker 1>statistics.</v>

313
00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:46.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's how we decide when we have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant defect.</v>

314
00:17:46.481 --> 00:17:50.400
<v Speaker 1>If there's a significant difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between two groups or better still,</v>

315
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:51.893
<v Speaker 1>if you randomly assign people to groups </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you do an experimental </v>

316
00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:58.590
<v Speaker 1>manipulation and then you measure the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome,</v>

317
00:17:58.620 --> 00:17:59.453
<v Speaker 1>the means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can test to see whether your </v>

318
00:18:01.021 --> 00:18:01.854
<v Speaker 1>experimental manipulation produced an </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect that would be greater than </v>

319
00:18:06.061 --> 00:18:08.430
<v Speaker 1>chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you infer that,</v>

320
00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:13.050
<v Speaker 1>well there's a low probability one in 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you would,</v>

321
00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:14.813
<v Speaker 1>you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

322
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:18.900
<v Speaker 1>produce that effect if you were just </v>
<v Speaker 1>running random simulations.</v>

323
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.943
<v Speaker 1>And therefore you can say with some </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainty that there's an actual causal </v>

324
00:18:23.251 --> 00:18:25.170
<v Speaker 1>effect that's with an experimental </v>
<v Speaker 1>model.</v>

325
00:18:25.171 --> 00:18:26.060
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

326
00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:28.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you think,</v>

327
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:29.700
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

328
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:30.773
<v Speaker 1>let me give you a conundrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I used to study people who were sons </v>

329
00:18:34.441 --> 00:18:36.870
<v Speaker 1>of male alcoholics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

330
00:18:36.871 --> 00:18:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Now there was a reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't have women.</v>

331
00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:42.090
<v Speaker 1>Why might that be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't use women.</v>

332
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

333
00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:49.090
<v Speaker 1>why would they be confounding part from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that they're women?</v>

334
00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.660
<v Speaker 1>I supposed to be a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

335
00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a better joke than that.</v>

336
00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:56.373
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

337
00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:01.400
<v Speaker 3>Well it could be that it was some sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of emotional coping mechanism difference</v>

338
00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:03.503
<v Speaker 3>between the way that deal with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>father daughter relationship is </v>

339
00:19:08.821 --> 00:19:09.650
<v Speaker 3>different then.</v>

340
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:10.311
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well so that,</v>

341
00:19:10.311 --> 00:19:12.790
<v Speaker 1>that's a part that's not about Aaronson </v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

342
00:19:12.791 --> 00:19:15.320
<v Speaker 1>it's not the answer that was appropriate</v>
<v Speaker 1>for our research.</v>

343
00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:16.154
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you why because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't infer it from the question we </v>

344
00:19:18.561 --> 00:19:23.561
<v Speaker 1>were interested in what factors made </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcoholism hereditary cause it does seem</v>

345
00:19:23.841 --> 00:19:24.674
<v Speaker 1>to have a strong hereditary component.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what we basically concluded after </v>

346
00:19:27.531 --> 00:19:28.364
<v Speaker 1>doing a tremendous amount of research </v>
<v Speaker 1>was that people who are prone to </v>

347
00:19:31.161 --> 00:19:31.994
<v Speaker 1>alcoholism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least one type of person who's prone </v>

348
00:19:34.251 --> 00:19:36.740
<v Speaker 1>to one type of alcoholism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

349
00:19:36.741 --> 00:19:37.574
<v Speaker 1>a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very powerful stimulant effect from the </v>

350
00:19:39.801 --> 00:19:44.801
<v Speaker 1>alcohol during the time that their blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol level was ascending in the 10 or</v>

351
00:19:45.291 --> 00:19:46.124
<v Speaker 1>15 minutes after they took a drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if they took a large drink </v>

352
00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:53.660
<v Speaker 1>faxed or multiple large drinks fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can probably tell.</v>

353
00:19:53.661 --> 00:19:55.310
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're one of these people,</v>

354
00:19:55.311 --> 00:19:58.400
<v Speaker 1>if you want to go do this and the bar </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next time you go,</v>

355
00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:02.390
<v Speaker 1>go on an empty stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take your pulse,</v>

356
00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:06.800
<v Speaker 1>write it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drink three or four shots fast,</v>

357
00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.890
<v Speaker 1>wait 10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take your pulse again.</v>

358
00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.620
<v Speaker 1>If it's gone up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 or 15 beats a minute,</v>

359
00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.073
<v Speaker 1>look out because that means alcohol is </v>
<v Speaker 1>working as a psychomotor stimulant for </v>

360
00:20:18.441 --> 00:20:19.274
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we found that for many of these </v>

361
00:20:21.171 --> 00:20:24.170
<v Speaker 1>people that was an opiate effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What seemed to happen was that when they</v>

362
00:20:24.171 --> 00:20:28.280
<v Speaker 1>drank alcohol fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they produced probably Beta endorphin,</v>

363
00:20:28.281 --> 00:20:31.940
<v Speaker 1>although that we were never sure we can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be blocked with Naltrexone,</v>

364
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.640
<v Speaker 1>which is an opiate antagonist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>

365
00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.540
<v Speaker 1>The other characteristic of that pattern</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

366
00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:42.620
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of alcohol consumption is that the,</v>

367
00:20:42.621 --> 00:20:43.454
<v Speaker 1>the real kick only occurs when you're on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ascending limb of the blood alcohol </v>

368
00:20:46.611 --> 00:20:47.261
<v Speaker 1>curve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

369
00:20:47.261 --> 00:20:48.094
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your blood alcohol goes up and then it </v>

370
00:20:49.841 --> 00:20:52.210
<v Speaker 1>goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And generally when it goes down,</v>

371
00:20:52.211 --> 00:20:53.044
<v Speaker 1>it's not pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when you start to feel hung over </v>

372
00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:58.660
<v Speaker 1>and hangovers actually alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 1>withdrawal by the way.</v>

373
00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.090
<v Speaker 1>So it's like heroin withdrawal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptance,</v>

374
00:21:01.091 --> 00:21:01.924
<v Speaker 1>alcohol withdrawal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's generally not pleasant for </v>

375
00:21:03.791 --> 00:21:04.060
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

376
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.720
<v Speaker 1>So they usually sleep through it or it </v>
<v Speaker 1>puts them to sleep.</v>

377
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:10.990
<v Speaker 1>But if you're one of these people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a real kick on the ascending limb of</v>

378
00:21:10.991 --> 00:21:13.690
<v Speaker 1>the blood alcohol curve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can just keep pounding back the</v>

379
00:21:13.691 --> 00:21:14.524
<v Speaker 1>alcohol and it'll keep hitting you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep you in that position where you're </v>

380
00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:18.851
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

381
00:21:18.851 --> 00:21:21.370
<v Speaker 1>on the on ass ending part of the blood </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol curve.</v>

382
00:21:21.371 --> 00:21:23.170
<v Speaker 1>And you can probably tell if you're one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these people,</v>

383
00:21:23.171 --> 00:21:26.350
<v Speaker 1>if you can't stop once you get started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

384
00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:29.080
<v Speaker 1>so if it's like you have four drinks </v>
<v Speaker 1>quick and it's like,</v>

385
00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:29.973
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gone until the alcohol runs out </v>

386
00:21:32.111 --> 00:21:32.944
<v Speaker 1>or until it's four in the morning or </v>
<v Speaker 1>till you've spent all your money or </v>

387
00:21:35.081 --> 00:21:35.914
<v Speaker 1>you've been at last bar in town or that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sitting on your friend's bed </v>

388
00:21:38.261 --> 00:21:41.620
<v Speaker 1>after everybody's going home from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>party and you're still drinking,</v>

389
00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.170
<v Speaker 1>you might suspect that you're one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those people.</v>

390
00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.333
<v Speaker 1>And if you are one of those people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you should watch the halo </v>

391
00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.660
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

392
00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:52.420
<v Speaker 1>alcohol is a vicious drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

393
00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:53.433
<v Speaker 1>it gets people in its grasp hard and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for them to escape once they </v>

394
00:21:56.501 --> 00:21:59.590
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People also drink to quell anxiety.</v>

395
00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.053
<v Speaker 1>So now the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we were looking at the genetics </v>

396
00:22:03.821 --> 00:22:04.654
<v Speaker 1>of alcoholism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't easy to study offspring of </v>

397
00:22:08.531 --> 00:22:09.364
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic mothers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is they might </v>

398
00:22:11.621 --> 00:22:16.621
<v Speaker 1>have consumed alcohol during pregnancy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which case that's a bad idea.</v>

399
00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:22.260
<v Speaker 1>Especially there's certain key times in </v>
<v Speaker 1>pregnancy were even a few drinks are not</v>

400
00:22:22.391 --> 00:22:24.550
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's turns out,</v>

401
00:22:24.551 --> 00:22:25.384
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that turns out to be the times when the </v>

402
00:22:27.341 --> 00:22:30.070
<v Speaker 1>fetus is producing the bulk of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>hippocampus tissue.</v>

403
00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:31.413
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if it turned out that daughters or </v>

404
00:22:34.121 --> 00:22:39.121
<v Speaker 1>sons of female alcoholics were markedly </v>
<v Speaker 1>different from the general population in</v>

405
00:22:40.331 --> 00:22:41.164
<v Speaker 1>some manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't be able to tell if that was </v>

406
00:22:42.971 --> 00:22:47.290
<v Speaker 1>a consequence of alcohol consumption </v>
<v Speaker 1>during pregnancy or if it was,</v>

407
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:48.850
<v Speaker 1>it was a genetic reflection.</v>

408
00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:49.923
<v Speaker 1>So what we want it to do was study sons </v>
<v Speaker 1>of male alcoholics and so their mothers </v>

409
00:22:53.801 --> 00:22:57.910
<v Speaker 1>actually couldn't be alcoholic and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted their fathers,</v>

410
00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:01.960
<v Speaker 1>the best subjects had an alcoholic </v>
<v Speaker 1>father and an alcoholic grandfather.</v>

411
00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:03.003
<v Speaker 1>And at least one or more alcoholics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first or second degree male relatives </v>

412
00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:10.510
<v Speaker 1>and they couldn't be alcoholic and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>had to be young.</v>

413
00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:14.410
<v Speaker 1>So because obviously if they were 40 and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still work alcoholic,</v>

414
00:23:14.411 --> 00:23:16.550
<v Speaker 1>then they probably weren't going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic.</v>

415
00:23:16.551 --> 00:23:18.400
<v Speaker 1>So we wanted to catch them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

416
00:23:18.401 --> 00:23:21.040
<v Speaker 1>between say well it had to be 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>

417
00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.340
<v Speaker 1>it was in Quebec.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was even a little late probably.</v>

418
00:23:24.341 --> 00:23:25.174
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's best we could do from an ethical </v>

419
00:23:26.381 --> 00:23:27.214
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we used to bring these guys into the </v>

420
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.330
<v Speaker 1>lab and get them quite drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

421
00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:34.780
<v Speaker 1>the National Institute of Alcohol is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an alcohol abuse,</v>

422
00:23:34.781 --> 00:23:39.280
<v Speaker 1>pretty much put a stop to that research </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we used to bring them in and you</v>

423
00:23:39.281 --> 00:23:40.870
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd get their blood alcohol level up to</v>

424
00:23:40.871 --> 00:23:42.580
<v Speaker 1>0.1,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2.1.</v>

425
00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:43.413
<v Speaker 1>It had to be pretty high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It actually looked like the real </v>

426
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:47.840
<v Speaker 1>physiological effects seem to kick in </v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

427
00:23:47.841 --> 00:23:51.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people hit legal intoxication.</v>

428
00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:52.363
<v Speaker 1>So you don't really get the opiate </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect till you park yourself up about </v>

429
00:23:54.471 --> 00:23:57.260
<v Speaker 1>point your weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the legal limit for driving at</v>

430
00:23:57.261 --> 00:23:58.730
<v Speaker 1>that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

431
00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:01.280
<v Speaker 1>so we used to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these guys were pretty big.</v>

432
00:24:01.281 --> 00:24:04.580
<v Speaker 1>They come in there and maybe 230 pound </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys to get them up to,</v>

433
00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:06.013
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>0.1 or 0.2 you had or 0.12 you had to </v>

434
00:24:08.571 --> 00:24:12.200
<v Speaker 1>give them quite a bit credit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lack of alcohol and then what we usually</v>

435
00:24:12.201 --> 00:24:13.034
<v Speaker 1>do is we let them sober up till the </v>
<v Speaker 1>point it will six bout that and then </v>

436
00:24:15.771 --> 00:24:19.880
<v Speaker 1>we'd send them home in a cap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well when the Eni Aaa got all ethical on</v>

437
00:24:19.881 --> 00:24:20.714
<v Speaker 1>the whole situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't let us send them home </v>

438
00:24:22.311 --> 00:24:23.840
<v Speaker 1>until they hit 0.02.</v>

439
00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:24.771
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

440
00:24:24.771 --> 00:24:25.604
<v Speaker 1>if you're a 240 pounds and we've just </v>
<v Speaker 1>nailed you with enough alcohol so that </v>

441
00:24:28.791 --> 00:24:32.780
<v Speaker 1>your blood alcohol level hit 0.12 you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be sitting in our bloody lab,</v>

442
00:24:32.781 --> 00:24:33.614
<v Speaker 1>bored to death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling horrible for like six hours or </v>

443
00:24:35.361 --> 00:24:38.430
<v Speaker 1>seven hours and you'd be pretty damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>irritated about it.</v>

444
00:24:38.431 --> 00:24:41.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like it wasn't obvious how we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to keep the people there.</v>

445
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:42.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

446
00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.820
<v Speaker 1>can I leave?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

447
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:45.043
<v Speaker 1>I'm not paying you if you leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's going to produce real </v>

448
00:24:47.031 --> 00:24:49.970
<v Speaker 1>positive outcomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with like drunk people in the lab,</v>

449
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:50.833
<v Speaker 1>that's going to work really well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course then they never come back </v>

450
00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:54.980
<v Speaker 1>either because it was such a bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>awful experience.</v>

451
00:24:55.340 --> 00:25:00.110
<v Speaker 1>So I stopped doing that research partly </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it became impossible anyways,</v>

452
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:01.063
<v Speaker 1>we did find out a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We found out that there was this one </v>

453
00:25:03.171 --> 00:25:07.970
<v Speaker 1>particular pattern of of alcohol abuse </v>
<v Speaker 1>that seemed to be hereditary,</v>

454
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:10.520
<v Speaker 1>so every couldn't study it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women.</v>

455
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:11.923
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now there was a problem with this </v>

456
00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.440
<v Speaker 1>line of research and the problem was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

457
00:25:18.441 --> 00:25:21.350
<v Speaker 1>alcoholism comes along with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

458
00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.990
<v Speaker 1>So this was correlational research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

459
00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:25.470
<v Speaker 1>We take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

460
00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:26.373
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we pick a group of people and we've </v>

461
00:25:27.921 --> 00:25:29.750
<v Speaker 1>matched them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sons of male alcoholics,</v>

462
00:25:29.751 --> 00:25:33.230
<v Speaker 1>we'd match them with people who weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>sons of male alcoholics.</v>

463
00:25:33.231 --> 00:25:35.480
<v Speaker 1>So they were still sons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were still the same age,</v>

464
00:25:35.481 --> 00:25:38.870
<v Speaker 1>but their fathers weren't the alcoholic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here's the problem.</v>

465
00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:41.690
<v Speaker 1>What should we match them on?</v>

466
00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.800
<v Speaker 2>Age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender?</v>

467
00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't match them on number of drinks</v>

468
00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:50.830
<v Speaker 1>obviously because</v>

469
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:55.350
<v Speaker 1>you want the people who are alcoholic in</v>
<v Speaker 1>one group,</v>

470
00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:56.543
<v Speaker 1>not to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to alcoholics in the </v>

471
00:25:58.141 --> 00:25:58.974
<v Speaker 1>second group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you match them on number of </v>

472
00:25:59.821 --> 00:26:01.470
<v Speaker 1>drinks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

473
00:26:01.471 --> 00:26:02.304
<v Speaker 1>if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you don't know if this effect that </v>

474
00:26:03.931 --> 00:26:04.764
<v Speaker 1>you're measuring is a consequence of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic difference or on the number of </v>

475
00:26:07.471 --> 00:26:10.650
<v Speaker 1>drinks per week or drinks per occasion </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the people had.</v>

476
00:26:10.651 --> 00:26:11.484
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be a confounding variable if you </v>

477
00:26:12.571 --> 00:26:13.404
<v Speaker 1>match them for antisocial personality or</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti-personnel anti social personality </v>

478
00:26:16.981 --> 00:26:17.814
<v Speaker 1>symptoms because lots of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic have they tilt towards the </v>

479
00:26:21.571 --> 00:26:22.404
<v Speaker 1>antisocial side of the spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you control for that while you </v>

480
00:26:25.531 --> 00:26:26.364
<v Speaker 1>don't know because you don't know if </v>
<v Speaker 1>antisocial personalities part of </v>

481
00:26:28.201 --> 00:26:29.034
<v Speaker 1>alcoholism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's part of the same underlying </v>

482
00:26:30.631 --> 00:26:31.464
<v Speaker 1>genetic problem or if it's a secondary </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestation or if its consequences </v>

483
00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:35.970
<v Speaker 1>drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know any of that.</v>

484
00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:38.400
<v Speaker 1>Do you match them on depressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>symptoms?</v>

485
00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:41.250
<v Speaker 1>Do you match them on schooling?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You match them on education.</v>

486
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:42.263
<v Speaker 1>Do you match them on personality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you match them on other forms of </v>

487
00:26:45.121 --> 00:26:49.110
<v Speaker 1>psychopathology?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you match them on what they drink?</v>

488
00:26:49.111 --> 00:26:53.160
<v Speaker 1>Do you match them on how many drinks per</v>
<v Speaker 1>occasion they drink when they drink,</v>

489
00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:54.990
<v Speaker 1>et cetera?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

490
00:26:54.991 --> 00:26:55.824
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that is you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is there's </v>

491
00:27:00.301 --> 00:27:03.630
<v Speaker 1>actually an infinite number of potential</v>
<v Speaker 1>covariants</v>

492
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:09.570
<v Speaker 1>because you don't know what differences </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are between the two groups are the</v>

493
00:27:09.571 --> 00:27:12.450
<v Speaker 1>differences that are relevant to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question at hand.</v>

494
00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:17.730
<v Speaker 1>Now that's actually one of the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems with psychiatric research.</v>

495
00:27:17.731 --> 00:27:18.564
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be a problem with psychiatric </v>

496
00:27:20.461 --> 00:27:24.180
<v Speaker 1>research that so serious that it cannot </v>
<v Speaker 1>be solved.</v>

497
00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:25.493
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you take kids who are attention </v>

498
00:27:26.761 --> 00:27:29.600
<v Speaker 1>deficit disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say this is horrible,</v>

499
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:30.463
<v Speaker 1>diagnosed a criteria and you match them </v>
<v Speaker 1>with kids who aren't and then you look </v>

500
00:27:34.141 --> 00:27:37.200
<v Speaker 1>to see what the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes the adhd kids different,</v>

501
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:39.030
<v Speaker 1>what do you match them on?</v>

502
00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:42.210
<v Speaker 1>Well you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is,</v>

503
00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:45.420
<v Speaker 1>so usually what happens is the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who do psychiatric research</v>

504
00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:48.323
<v Speaker 1>finance this a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they matched them on the important </v>

505
00:27:50.281 --> 00:27:52.050
<v Speaker 1>variables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>age,</v>

506
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:55.290
<v Speaker 1>physical health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe education,</v>

507
00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:58.470
<v Speaker 1>but the poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is you actually have no idea</v>

508
00:27:58.471 --> 00:27:59.304
<v Speaker 1>what the important variables are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are an unlimited number of </v>

509
00:28:01.741 --> 00:28:02.574
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's actually why random ass I </v>

510
00:28:05.101 --> 00:28:07.980
<v Speaker 1>nation to groups is so important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

511
00:28:07.981 --> 00:28:10.980
<v Speaker 1>if I take all of you and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

512
00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:17.270
<v Speaker 1>let's look at the effects of alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I would do is I'd say you'd come</v>

513
00:28:18.211 --> 00:28:20.280
<v Speaker 1>towards me and I do a golden board </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorting.</v>

514
00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:21.960
<v Speaker 1>You go to the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd go to the right,</v>

515
00:28:21.961 --> 00:28:23.480
<v Speaker 1>you go to the last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to the right.</v>

516
00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:26.850
<v Speaker 1>This says nonbiased separation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>two populations.</v>

517
00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:28.043
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe I'd give one group two </v>
<v Speaker 1>ounces of alcohol and water and the </v>

518
00:28:32.131 --> 00:28:33.630
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or in coke say,</v>

519
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:34.583
<v Speaker 1>and in the other group I put a few drops</v>
<v Speaker 1>of alcohol on the top of a glass of </v>

520
00:28:37.771 --> 00:28:38.040
<v Speaker 1>coke.</v>

521
00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:38.873
<v Speaker 1>So it smelled like alcohol and tasted </v>
<v Speaker 1>like alcohol when you had your first </v>

522
00:28:41.521 --> 00:28:42.354
<v Speaker 1>drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I put you through a whole </v>

523
00:28:43.291 --> 00:28:45.810
<v Speaker 1>battery of neuropsychological and </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality tests,</v>

524
00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:46.763
<v Speaker 1>which I did by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a bunch of people would think it was </v>

525
00:28:48.361 --> 00:28:51.570
<v Speaker 1>the first publication I had back in </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 85 or something like that.</v>

526
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:52.793
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>random ass I nation gets rid of the </v>

527
00:28:56.521 --> 00:28:59.010
<v Speaker 1>necessity for the infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>covariates,</v>

528
00:28:59.040 --> 00:28:59.873
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're all different than a </v>

529
00:29:00.691 --> 00:29:01.524
<v Speaker 1>whole bunch of important ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we can assume as long as I threw </v>

530
00:29:04.051 --> 00:29:07.380
<v Speaker 1>half of you in this group randomly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>half of you in that group randomly,</v>

531
00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:11.750
<v Speaker 1>then all your various idiosyncrasies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how many they are,</v>

532
00:29:11.751 --> 00:29:12.584
<v Speaker 1>our would cancel out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the massive advantage to and </v>

533
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:17.460
<v Speaker 1>mass I nation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

534
00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:20.130
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you're going to notice</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go through psychology,</v>

535
00:29:20.131 --> 00:29:22.320
<v Speaker 1>especially if you do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopathological work,</v>

536
00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:25.290
<v Speaker 1>is that the studies are almost always </v>
<v Speaker 1>correlational.</v>

537
00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.210
<v Speaker 1>And they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll do,</v>

538
00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.690
<v Speaker 1>they'll coat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll control for relevant covariates.</v>

539
00:29:30.691 --> 00:29:34.590
<v Speaker 1>That's what it will say in the paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is you don't bloody well</v>

540
00:29:34.591 --> 00:29:36.990
<v Speaker 1>know what the ran the relevant </v>
<v Speaker 1>covariates are.</v>

541
00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:39.150
<v Speaker 1>If you did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd already understand the condition.</v>

542
00:29:39.151 --> 00:29:40.860
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't have to do the damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>

543
00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:42.123
<v Speaker 1>So you can make a pretty strong case </v>
<v Speaker 1>that all psychiatric research that is </v>

544
00:29:45.491 --> 00:29:49.720
<v Speaker 1>studying psychopathological groups </v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to act control,</v>

545
00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:50.613
<v Speaker 1>it's all not interpreted them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out in that kind of </v>

546
00:29:56.051 --> 00:29:56.884
<v Speaker 1>research that who should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the control should be is the killer </v>

547
00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:05.020
<v Speaker 1>because you don't know picking the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopathological populations easy,</v>

548
00:30:05.021 --> 00:30:08.920
<v Speaker 1>you just pick them according to whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnostic checklist you happen to use.</v>

549
00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:11.740
<v Speaker 1>But when you figure out who to control </v>
<v Speaker 1>them against,</v>

550
00:30:11.741 --> 00:30:12.574
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

551
00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:13.930
<v Speaker 3>okay</v>

552
00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:15.480
<v Speaker 1>siblings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

553
00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:16.720
<v Speaker 1>what are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>

554
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:17.583
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you have match a population and </v>

555
00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:22.720
<v Speaker 1>answer his account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

556
00:30:22.721 --> 00:30:25.600
<v Speaker 1>the reason that we didn't include women </v>
<v Speaker 1>was because</v>

557
00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:27.860
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>

558
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:29.263
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

559
00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:30.443
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uncontrollable potential con </v>

560
00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:35.430
<v Speaker 1>confounding effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only way that you can do that is</v>

561
00:30:35.431 --> 00:30:36.264
<v Speaker 1>to assign randomly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's an important thing to </v>

562
00:30:38.101 --> 00:30:38.934
<v Speaker 1>remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's why experimental designs are way </v>

563
00:30:40.981 --> 00:30:43.320
<v Speaker 1>more powerful than correlational </v>
<v Speaker 1>designs.</v>

564
00:30:43.321 --> 00:30:45.900
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is frequently in </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology,</v>

565
00:30:45.901 --> 00:30:46.734
<v Speaker 1>what you see are correlational designs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I think if you're careful and you </v>

566
00:30:49.441 --> 00:30:51.150
<v Speaker 1>dig around and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

567
00:30:51.151 --> 00:30:51.984
<v Speaker 1>you're obsessively careful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can extract information out of </v>

568
00:30:53.791 --> 00:30:55.500
<v Speaker 1>correlational studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's no,</v>

569
00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:59.100
<v Speaker 1>it's no simple thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see this problem come up too.</v>

570
00:30:59.101 --> 00:31:01.800
<v Speaker 1>When you hear about studies on Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it's like,</v>

571
00:31:01.801 --> 00:31:04.450
<v Speaker 1>well you should eat low fat diet or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should eat a high fat diet.</v>

572
00:31:04.451 --> 00:31:05.284
<v Speaker 1>Or usually what happens is they track </v>
<v Speaker 1>people across time who hypothetically </v>

573
00:31:09.211 --> 00:31:10.044
<v Speaker 1>have been having one diet or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is you don't know what </v>

574
00:31:12.331 --> 00:31:14.280
<v Speaker 1>the hell else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes those people different.</v>

575
00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:19.980
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with that is there is an</v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite number of potential things that</v>

576
00:31:19.981 --> 00:31:22.830
<v Speaker 1>make them different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big problem.</v>

577
00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:27.660
<v Speaker 1>The probability that you've picked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one thing that makes people who have</v>

578
00:31:27.661 --> 00:31:28.494
<v Speaker 1>a high fat diet different from other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and that it happens to be that </v>

579
00:31:31.021 --> 00:31:33.960
<v Speaker 1>they have a high fat diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the only difference.</v>

580
00:31:33.961 --> 00:31:35.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

581
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:36.490
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

582
00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.380
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

583
00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

584
00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:41.580
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

585
00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:43.973
<v Speaker 1>random ass I nation gets rid of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem of the infinite number of </v>

586
00:31:46.381 --> 00:31:49.260
<v Speaker 1>covariates and that's worth knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing that we've just</v>

587
00:31:49.261 --> 00:31:50.760
<v Speaker 1>figured out is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

588
00:31:50.761 --> 00:31:51.594
<v Speaker 1>if you make a measurement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get a distribution </v>

589
00:31:53.281 --> 00:31:55.230
<v Speaker 1>around the measurement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you do that in two groups,</v>

590
00:31:55.231 --> 00:31:56.064
<v Speaker 1>you can check out the overlap between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the two groups and you can determine </v>

591
00:31:58.651 --> 00:31:59.484
<v Speaker 1>what the probability is that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>overlap is there as a consequence of </v>

592
00:32:01.921 --> 00:32:03.930
<v Speaker 1>chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>

593
00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:05.243
<v Speaker 1>why not set your probability level two </v>
<v Speaker 1>like one in 10,000 so you can be </v>

594
00:32:09.931 --> 00:32:12.960
<v Speaker 1>absolutely damn sure that the two groups</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't overlap.</v>

595
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:15.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so why wouldn't you do that?</v>

596
00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.133
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't you set p equals 0.0001 </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of p equals 0.05 so that would </v>

597
00:32:21.931 --> 00:32:25.110
<v Speaker 1>be one in a thousand instead of one and </v>
<v Speaker 1>20 yes,</v>

598
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:26.423
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

599
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:31.500
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're basically damned if you do and</v>

600
00:32:31.501 --> 00:32:32.334
<v Speaker 1>damned if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very important thing to </v>

601
00:32:33.541 --> 00:32:37.890
<v Speaker 1>remember about life because generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you make a choice of any sort,</v>

602
00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:41.750
<v Speaker 1>there's error and risk on both sides of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the choice.</v>

603
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.860
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

604
00:32:42.861 --> 00:32:45.500
<v Speaker 1>really useful to remember that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>people always ask,</v>

605
00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:47.890
<v Speaker 1>act like their current situation is </v>
<v Speaker 1>risk-free,</v>

606
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:50.060
<v Speaker 1>which is never ever the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

607
00:32:50.061 --> 00:32:52.340
<v Speaker 1>So people were trying to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

608
00:32:52.341 --> 00:32:56.510
<v Speaker 1>how do we balance the risk of finding </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that doesn't exist against the</v>

609
00:32:56.511 --> 00:33:00.680
<v Speaker 1>risk of not finding something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists and the reason it's one in 20 and</v>

610
00:33:00.681 --> 00:33:03.890
<v Speaker 1>why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because someone made that guests 40</v>

611
00:33:03.891 --> 00:33:06.260
<v Speaker 1>years ago or 50 years ago and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck.</v>

612
00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:10.100
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the other thing to notice is that</v>

613
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:14.660
<v Speaker 1>you want to be careful about the p </v>
<v Speaker 1>equals 0.05 phenomena.</v>

614
00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:15.493
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things you'll see is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people treat any experimental </v>

615
00:33:18.651 --> 00:33:19.520
<v Speaker 1>result.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get,</v>

616
00:33:19.521 --> 00:33:23.060
<v Speaker 1>like it's significant if the probability</v>
<v Speaker 1>is 0.05 or less.</v>

617
00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:24.103
<v Speaker 1>And it's not if it's 0.06 or greater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not smart because the cutoff </v>

618
00:33:30.231 --> 00:33:31.064
<v Speaker 1>is the cutoff is arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to know three things to </v>

619
00:33:33.981 --> 00:33:36.520
<v Speaker 1>interpret an experimental result.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you,</v>

620
00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:37.363
<v Speaker 1>it's like you can't calculate the area </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a triangle without knowing three </v>

621
00:33:39.711 --> 00:33:41.480
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's three things anyways.</v>

622
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:43.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to know the number of people in</v>

623
00:33:43.971 --> 00:33:48.330
<v Speaker 1>the study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to know the size of the effect.</v>

624
00:33:48.331 --> 00:33:49.164
<v Speaker 1>So that would be the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>between two or more variables that </v>

625
00:33:51.051 --> 00:33:51.884
<v Speaker 1>you're interested in looking at and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to know the probability that </v>

626
00:33:54.711 --> 00:33:59.711
<v Speaker 1>you would find that effect size among </v>
<v Speaker 1>the population of that size by chance.</v>

627
00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:05.170
<v Speaker 1>And you cannot interpret one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers without the other two.</v>

628
00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:08.420
<v Speaker 1>It's not possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now psychologists,</v>

629
00:34:08.421 --> 00:34:13.040
<v Speaker 1>the status statistician's amongst </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists who have a clue,</v>

630
00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.113
<v Speaker 1>I've been jumping up and down for 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years trying to get psychologists to </v>

631
00:34:17.871 --> 00:34:22.550
<v Speaker 1>report all three of those every time </v>
<v Speaker 1>they report anything effect size,</v>

632
00:34:22.551 --> 00:34:23.870
<v Speaker 1>which seems logical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

633
00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:25.033
<v Speaker 1>The effect size is the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the two means divided by the </v>

634
00:34:29.901 --> 00:34:33.440
<v Speaker 1>standard deviation of the entire of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the pool group.</v>

635
00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:34.753
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need both of those because it's the </v>

636
00:34:36.081 --> 00:34:39.500
<v Speaker 1>standard deviation that tells you how </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn big the man the numbers are.</v>

637
00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Because what is 70 mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

638
00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:45.770
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 it's like if I just came out here and</v>

639
00:34:45.771 --> 00:34:46.604
<v Speaker 1>said that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could say 70 and 40 are those </v>

640
00:34:48.771 --> 00:34:50.240
<v Speaker 1>different?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

641
00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:52.520
<v Speaker 1>what the hell does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean anything.</v>

642
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:57.440
<v Speaker 1>You need to know what the units are and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the distribution gives you the units.</v>

643
00:34:57.441 --> 00:34:59.420
<v Speaker 1>And so once you know the units are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

644
00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:00.763
<v Speaker 1>well here's how big the differences </v>
<v Speaker 1>between these two groups and here's the </v>

645
00:35:02.871 --> 00:35:06.110
<v Speaker 1>probability that that would be acquired </v>
<v Speaker 1>by chance.</v>

646
00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:10.130
<v Speaker 1>And so that's how confident you could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's an actual difference.</v>

647
00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:11.443
<v Speaker 1>And so you want to always report effect </v>
<v Speaker 1>sizes and most of you are going to be </v>

648
00:35:14.061 --> 00:35:17.480
<v Speaker 1>taught to look at the damn probability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's stupid.</v>

649
00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:20.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you want to know how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how tall,</v>

650
00:35:20.691 --> 00:35:23.150
<v Speaker 1>how much difference there isn't height </v>
<v Speaker 1>between two people.</v>

651
00:35:23.151 --> 00:35:25.520
<v Speaker 1>You want to know how much difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is in height.</v>

652
00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:29.870
<v Speaker 1>You also might want to know to what </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree that's there because of chance.</v>

653
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:32.930
<v Speaker 1>But it's the effect size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the critical variable.</v>

654
00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:33.793
<v Speaker 1>Now you can't understand the effect size</v>
<v Speaker 1>without understanding how many subjects </v>

655
00:35:36.351 --> 00:35:37.184
<v Speaker 1>were in the experiment and also the </v>
<v Speaker 1>probability that you would acquire that </v>

656
00:35:40.741 --> 00:35:42.990
<v Speaker 1>by chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you want to keep that in mind.</v>

657
00:35:42.991 --> 00:35:45.300
<v Speaker 1>And when you're reading scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>papers,</v>

658
00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:46.980
<v Speaker 1>you want to be looking at the effect </v>
<v Speaker 1>size,</v>

659
00:35:46.981 --> 00:35:49.230
<v Speaker 1>how large an effect size is this?</v>

660
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Now I teach all the effect sizes are you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can transform one into another.</v>

661
00:35:53.641 --> 00:35:54.474
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of correlation coefficients which go up </v>

662
00:35:55.861 --> 00:35:56.694
<v Speaker 1>to one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the square of the correlation </v>

663
00:35:59.191 --> 00:36:00.024
<v Speaker 1>coefficient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the amount of variance that's </v>

664
00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:01.973
<v Speaker 1>accounted for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that also goes up to one and you </v>

665
00:36:04.291 --> 00:36:07.620
<v Speaker 1>have your basic correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your basic correlation coefficients are,</v>

666
00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:08.550
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

667
00:36:08.551 --> 00:36:13.551
<v Speaker 1>your standard deviation effect sizes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is mean one minus mean to over the</v>

668
00:36:13.561 --> 00:36:18.561
<v Speaker 1>standard deviation of the entire group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so large effect sizes and psychology</v>

669
00:36:18.961 --> 00:36:19.794
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to you about this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are correlation coefficients of about </v>

670
00:36:22.771 --> 00:36:27.420
<v Speaker 1>0.5 or above or r squared's of 25% of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the variance,</v>

671
00:36:27.421 --> 00:36:32.421
<v Speaker 1>which is 0.5 squared or um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh mean one minus mean two of say half a</v>

672
00:36:34.861 --> 00:36:35.694
<v Speaker 1>standard deviation or greater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can derive that conclusion that </v>

673
00:36:39.571 --> 00:36:40.404
<v Speaker 1>those are relatively large effect sizes </v>
<v Speaker 1>by looking at the distribution of the </v>

674
00:36:44.191 --> 00:36:46.290
<v Speaker 1>effect sizes across the published </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature.</v>

675
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:47.783
<v Speaker 1>And most of you will be told estimates </v>
<v Speaker 1>for effect sizes that are actually way </v>

676
00:36:51.181 --> 00:36:55.260
<v Speaker 1>too large because those were guests as </v>
<v Speaker 1>to how big is a large effect size.</v>

677
00:36:55.261 --> 00:36:57.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some statistician guessed 50 years ago.</v>

678
00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:00.600
<v Speaker 1>So it's just like the point of five </v>
<v Speaker 1>rule.</v>

679
00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:02.850
<v Speaker 1>It's arbitrary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but doesn't mean it's stupid,</v>

680
00:37:02.851 --> 00:37:05.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's arbitrary and you don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get stuck on it.</v>

681
00:37:05.101 --> 00:37:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like it's some sort of fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

682
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:09.503
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

683
00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:13.663
<v Speaker 2>now</v>

684
00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:18.870
<v Speaker 1>let's look at um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pareto distribution.</v>

685
00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:43.513
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you're going to see </v>

686
00:37:44.421 --> 00:37:47.090
<v Speaker 1>about a prieto distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's definitely not normal.</v>

687
00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:51.373
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

688
00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:53.460
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I mentioned to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you before,</v>

689
00:37:53.461 --> 00:37:55.000
<v Speaker 1>but I want to hammer this home because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

690
00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:56.093
<v Speaker 1>it's unbelievably important for </v>
<v Speaker 1>determining how to understand the way </v>

691
00:38:00.001 --> 00:38:00.834
<v Speaker 1>the world lays itself out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how do we interpret the way that </v>

692
00:38:03.421 --> 00:38:06.480
<v Speaker 1>people distribute themselves in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their success across time.</v>

693
00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a,</v>

694
00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.520
<v Speaker 1>this is a fundamental law and I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you how it works.</v>

695
00:38:11.521 --> 00:38:12.354
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So their law is most of you get nothing </v>

696
00:38:14.311 --> 00:38:16.560
<v Speaker 1>in a few of you get everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>

697
00:38:16.561 --> 00:38:18.990
<v Speaker 1>So that's the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>

698
00:38:18.991 --> 00:38:19.824
<v Speaker 1>well that's because of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might attribute that to various </v>

699
00:38:22.201 --> 00:38:23.490
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

700
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:25.200
<v Speaker 1>if you're a left wing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

701
00:38:25.201 --> 00:38:26.034
<v Speaker 1>you attribute to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the inequities of the social </v>

702
00:38:27.901 --> 00:38:29.910
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a right winger,</v>

703
00:38:29.911 --> 00:38:34.620
<v Speaker 1>you basically attributed to the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that while most people are not that good</v>

704
00:38:34.621 --> 00:38:36.700
<v Speaker 1>at anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no wonder they end up with nothing.</v>

705
00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.980
<v Speaker 1>So they're not very smart and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not very hardworking,</v>

706
00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:42.190
<v Speaker 1>so they don't get very much of whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that thereafter.</v>

707
00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:43.593
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

708
00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.500
<v Speaker 1>we'll take that apart a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But before we do that,</v>

709
00:38:47.501 --> 00:38:49.330
<v Speaker 1>I want to show you an animation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

710
00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:53.120
<v Speaker 1>you got to watch this wound care for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell.</v>

711
00:38:53.121 --> 00:38:53.954
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's</v>

712
00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:02.650
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

713
00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:05.010
<v Speaker 1>this thing moves very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very quickly.</v>

714
00:39:05.011 --> 00:39:05.844
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

715
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:09.860
<v Speaker 2>go back to the beginning and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right now.</v>

716
00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:19.050
<v Speaker 1>So here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each of you gets $10 okay?</v>

717
00:39:19.361 --> 00:39:21.580
<v Speaker 1>So that's a non random starting likes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

718
00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:24.370
<v Speaker 1>You're all starting in the same place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's definitely not random,</v>

719
00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:26.140
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here,</v>

720
00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:29.310
<v Speaker 1>here's how you play this game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You flip a coin,</v>

721
00:39:29.311 --> 00:39:31.630
<v Speaker 1>you turn to your partner and you flip a </v>
<v Speaker 1>coin.</v>

722
00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:33.520
<v Speaker 1>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

723
00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.600
<v Speaker 1>it both comes up heads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you win and they lose.</v>

724
00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:40.210
<v Speaker 1>And if it comes up tails and heads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you lose and they win.</v>

725
00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:43.450
<v Speaker 1>And if the winner gets a dollar from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>loser,</v>

726
00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:44.943
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can imagine that this is a </v>

727
00:39:45.701 --> 00:39:48.190
<v Speaker 1>simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically it's like your age training</v>

728
00:39:48.191 --> 00:39:50.080
<v Speaker 1>bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

729
00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:51.340
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

730
00:39:51.341 --> 00:39:52.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give away a banana,</v>

731
00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:53.733
<v Speaker 1>then you're done with the banana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of your walkaway with 11 and one </v>

732
00:39:57.491 --> 00:40:01.180
<v Speaker 1>of you will walk away with nine and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you turn to someone else who just wander</v>

733
00:40:01.181 --> 00:40:03.400
<v Speaker 1>around the room and randomly trade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

734
00:40:03.401 --> 00:40:04.690
<v Speaker 1>So what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

735
00:40:04.691 --> 00:40:06.610
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that happens is this.</v>

736
00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we started the graph with everyone at</v>

737
00:40:11.771 --> 00:40:13.300
<v Speaker 1>10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

738
00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:15.880
<v Speaker 1>you've done a bunch of trades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

739
00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:17.530
<v Speaker 1>we don't know how many trades you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>done,</v>

740
00:40:17.531 --> 00:40:20.140
<v Speaker 1>but a fair number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens,</v>

741
00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:21.123
<v Speaker 1>what you see happening is some winners </v>
<v Speaker 1>are starting to emerge right on the </v>

742
00:40:23.831 --> 00:40:24.664
<v Speaker 1>right hand side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the people who've won every </v>

743
00:40:26.501 --> 00:40:28.810
<v Speaker 1>single trade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they've traded 10 times,</v>

744
00:40:28.811 --> 00:40:31.930
<v Speaker 1>so now they have 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the people on the other</v>

745
00:40:31.931 --> 00:40:36.190
<v Speaker 1>side who've lost nine out of the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>trades.</v>

746
00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Now what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens when you lose nine?</v>

747
00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.680
<v Speaker 1>What's the big problem that you have?</v>

748
00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:49.380
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You only have $1 left.</v>

749
00:40:49.381 --> 00:40:51.090
<v Speaker 1>So what happens if you lose another </v>
<v Speaker 1>trade?</v>

750
00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:53.273
<v Speaker 1>That's right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hit zero and zero is not a number </v>

751
00:40:55.921 --> 00:40:59.610
<v Speaker 1>like any other number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero is like the black hole of numbers.</v>

752
00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.730
<v Speaker 1>You fall into the zero hole and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

753
00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:05.910
<v Speaker 1>You're not in the game anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And poverty is like that.</v>

754
00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a kind of a trap and it's very,</v>

755
00:41:09.871 --> 00:41:12.390
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to get out of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

756
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:17.310
<v Speaker 1>and it seems to be in part because once </v>
<v Speaker 1>you fall off the charts enough,</v>

757
00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.950
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of things start conspiring </v>
<v Speaker 1>against you.</v>

758
00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.390
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

759
00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:28.770
<v Speaker 1>you don't have enough money to buy a </v>
<v Speaker 1>large amount of decent food cheaply,</v>

760
00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:33.770
<v Speaker 1>so you have to buy expensive junk food </v>
<v Speaker 1>in short term.</v>

761
00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:37.310
<v Speaker 1>So that might be one possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or let's say you end up on the street,</v>

762
00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:38.173
<v Speaker 1>well you can't even get a job then </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't have an address and </v>

763
00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:43.460
<v Speaker 1>you can't get social security because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have an address.</v>

764
00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:46.640
<v Speaker 1>Like things start to conspire against </v>
<v Speaker 1>you very badly.</v>

765
00:41:46.641 --> 00:41:47.474
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you're unemployed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been unemployed for a year and a </v>

766
00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:53.630
<v Speaker 1>half because it's been a prolonged </v>
<v Speaker 1>downturn in the economy.</v>

767
00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're 17,</v>

768
00:41:56.091 --> 00:41:56.924
<v Speaker 1>who the hell cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're 50 that might be that for </v>

769
00:41:59.901 --> 00:42:00.560
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

770
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.393
<v Speaker 1>You've hit zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd been out of the market for 18 </v>

771
00:42:02.721 --> 00:42:04.550
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's gonna hire you.</v>

772
00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:05.893
<v Speaker 1>And so you've hit zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is we don't know what </v>

773
00:42:09.051 --> 00:42:10.700
<v Speaker 1>the hell to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people hit zero,</v>

774
00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:14.930
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult to pry them out of zero </v>
<v Speaker 1>and throw them back in the game.</v>

775
00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Now you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

776
00:42:16.761 --> 00:42:20.960
<v Speaker 1>what if you just rearm them with money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that would actually work if the game</v>

777
00:42:20.961 --> 00:42:21.794
<v Speaker 1>was truly random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it isn't obvious that the game is </v>

778
00:42:25.371 --> 00:42:27.620
<v Speaker 1>truly random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's where things get weird.</v>

779
00:42:27.621 --> 00:42:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

780
00:42:28.881 --> 00:42:29.714
<v Speaker 1>by this point in the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some winners piling up and </v>

781
00:42:31.821 --> 00:42:33.860
<v Speaker 1>there's some losers planning up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

782
00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:37.850
<v Speaker 1>what's the difference between the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who have 19 and the people who have one?</v>

783
00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:39.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know the one people,</v>

784
00:42:39.561 --> 00:42:42.310
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be wiped out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got a 50% chance,</v>

785
00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:44.480
<v Speaker 1>a hidden zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about the 19 people?</v>

786
00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:50.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

787
00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:53.291
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

788
00:42:53.291 --> 00:42:55.720
<v Speaker 1>So they're in this place where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically sitting pretty,</v>

789
00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:56.703
<v Speaker 1>they can fail nine times and that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>puts them back to where they were to </v>

790
00:42:59.111 --> 00:43:00.970
<v Speaker 1>begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

791
00:43:00.971 --> 00:43:02.380
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we keep playing</v>

792
00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:33.680
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see what's happening is that with</v>

793
00:43:33.681 --> 00:43:34.514
<v Speaker 1>repeated random play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the normal distribution turns into a </v>

794
00:43:38.661 --> 00:43:42.470
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] distribution and most of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>population stacks up at zero.</v>

795
00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:45.520
<v Speaker 2>Hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

796
00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:50.490
<v Speaker 1>This old guy I told you about,</v>

797
00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:56.670
<v Speaker 1>he had a theory of social structure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was predicated on this.</v>

798
00:43:56.671 --> 00:43:59.640
<v Speaker 1>There's a bit of a Marxist twist to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought that what happened is that,</v>

799
00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:00.923
<v Speaker 1>so if you ran a game long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people will stack up at zero and a </v>

800
00:44:04.291 --> 00:44:05.910
<v Speaker 1>few people have everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

801
00:44:05.911 --> 00:44:10.110
<v Speaker 1>so let's say now you're down at zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your best strategy?</v>

802
00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:12.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

803
00:44:12.541 --> 00:44:14.010
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should reset the game,</v>

804
00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:16.083
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're at zero and it's </v>

805
00:44:17.131 --> 00:44:17.964
<v Speaker 1>basically a random game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you wipe out that game and you put a </v>

806
00:44:20.731 --> 00:44:21.564
<v Speaker 1>note in another one in place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some probability that when the </v>

807
00:44:23.581 --> 00:44:26.400
<v Speaker 1>next game starts playing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to end up at zero.</v>

808
00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:29.160
<v Speaker 1>And that was his theory of revolutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>

809
00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.790
<v Speaker 1>once the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once the game played itself out in until</v>

810
00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:34.710
<v Speaker 1>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're maximally distributed.</v>

811
00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:35.753
<v Speaker 1>It didn't cost the people at the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything to be revolutionaries because </v>

812
00:44:40.321 --> 00:44:41.154
<v Speaker 1>they aren't already hit zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of his hypothesis was that </v>

813
00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:46.673
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>political and economic systems have to </v>

814
00:44:50.611 --> 00:44:52.020
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to figure out how to do,</v>

815
00:44:52.021 --> 00:44:52.854
<v Speaker 1>is to make sure that the people who end </v>
<v Speaker 1>up on the zero side of the distribution </v>

816
00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:03.450
<v Speaker 1>don't have nothing to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you have nothing to lose,</v>

817
00:45:03.451 --> 00:45:05.640
<v Speaker 1>God only knows what you're going to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>next.</v>

818
00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:10.970
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a big problem because merely </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoveling money down there is not likely</v>

819
00:45:11.251 --> 00:45:13.290
<v Speaker 1>to change the outcome very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

820
00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:14.740
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

821
00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:17.690
<v Speaker 3>I was to say that sounds a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the policy though.</v>

822
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:19.063
<v Speaker 3>Like if you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you've reset beginning your </v>

823
00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:24.040
<v Speaker 3>probability of ending up happens first </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

824
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the p the probability that any given</v>

825
00:45:27.431 --> 00:45:28.264
<v Speaker 1>person will end up at zero is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the probability that you'll end up </v>

826
00:45:32.411 --> 00:45:33.280
<v Speaker 1>the same isn't it?</v>

827
00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:36.113
<v Speaker 1>Cause at the beginning of the game and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have just as much probability of </v>

828
00:45:38.091 --> 00:45:40.580
<v Speaker 1>moving up to the top as you do a moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to the bottom.</v>

829
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:43.370
<v Speaker 1>Once you write zero though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to play anymore.</v>

830
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.820
<v Speaker 1>So at zero your probability of moving up</v>
<v Speaker 1>is zero.</v>

831
00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:48.523
<v Speaker 1>Whereas at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your probability of moving up is 50% so </v>

832
00:45:52.821 --> 00:45:53.654
<v Speaker 1>when the gambler's fallacy is merely </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you keep dumping good money </v>

833
00:45:56.571 --> 00:45:58.160
<v Speaker 1>after bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll win it back.</v>

834
00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:59.023
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because let's say you've lost 10 times </v>

835
00:46:00.201 --> 00:46:01.280
<v Speaker 1>in a row and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

836
00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:02.233
<v Speaker 1>I've lost 10 times in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 50 50 I must have a virtually a </v>

837
00:46:05.031 --> 00:46:06.920
<v Speaker 1>hundred percent chance of winning the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next time.</v>

838
00:46:06.921 --> 00:46:07.431
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

839
00:46:07.431 --> 00:46:09.890
<v Speaker 1>no you don't because probability doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have any memory.</v>

840
00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:13.850
<v Speaker 1>That's the gambler's fallacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all right.</v>

841
00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:16.850
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things we might ask ourselves</v>

842
00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:17.713
<v Speaker 1>is this is something that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I discussed with him and lake </v>

843
00:46:21.201 --> 00:46:25.340
<v Speaker 1>because he really thought of this as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>random process and you know,</v>

844
00:46:25.341 --> 00:46:27.170
<v Speaker 1>because he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thought here it's very,</v>

845
00:46:27.171 --> 00:46:28.640
<v Speaker 1>very interesting and very complicated.</v>

846
00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:30.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

847
00:46:30.171 --> 00:46:33.170
<v Speaker 1>that the Iq distribution in this room is</v>
<v Speaker 1>approximately normal.</v>

848
00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:37.160
<v Speaker 1>And so we can assume that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of random factors.</v>

849
00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:38.141
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>

850
00:46:38.141 --> 00:46:40.550
<v Speaker 1>what do we mean random factors?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

851
00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:42.553
<v Speaker 1>there'd being random genetic things </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in your lineage since life </v>

852
00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.750
<v Speaker 1>began.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here you are.</v>

853
00:46:47.751 --> 00:46:49.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're smarter than him.</v>

854
00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

855
00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:52.393
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to eliminate the </v>

856
00:46:53.121 --> 00:46:55.820
<v Speaker 1>environmental effects for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just forget about them.</v>

857
00:46:55.850 --> 00:46:59.030
<v Speaker 1>We're going to assume that everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>been raised in an environment where they</v>

858
00:46:59.031 --> 00:47:02.450
<v Speaker 1>had enough to eat and where they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough resources,</v>

859
00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:03.843
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>informational resources so that their </v>

860
00:47:05.481 --> 00:47:06.314
<v Speaker 1>intellect can capitalize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So none of you people have been starved </v>

861
00:47:08.451 --> 00:47:09.284
<v Speaker 1>for information or food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say in many ways the </v>

862
00:47:11.901 --> 00:47:13.910
<v Speaker 1>important variation in the environment </v>
<v Speaker 1>is already be.</v>

863
00:47:13.911 --> 00:47:16.190
<v Speaker 1>Now your note for most of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not completely.</v>

864
00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:17.533
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's random occurrences in the past </v>

865
00:47:19.971 --> 00:47:23.750
<v Speaker 1>and the evolutionary history that's put </v>
<v Speaker 1>you wherever the hell you are and the Iq</v>

866
00:47:23.751 --> 00:47:24.584
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>

867
00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:27.620
<v Speaker 1>So you're the beneficiary of random </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces.</v>

868
00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:31.690
<v Speaker 1>So he thought of the problem is being </v>
<v Speaker 1>random all the way down to the bottom.</v>

869
00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:35.410
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem I have with that is wait</v>
<v Speaker 1>a second,</v>

870
00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:36.513
<v Speaker 1>we have evidence that some things </v>
<v Speaker 1>predict where you're going to end up in </v>

871
00:47:40.211 --> 00:47:42.970
<v Speaker 1>the distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what are those things?</v>

872
00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:45.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq,</v>

873
00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:48.610
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional stability,</v>

874
00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:51.850
<v Speaker 1>openness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's a creative product.</v>

875
00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:52.803
<v Speaker 1>And then some other smattering of </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality features depending on the </v>

876
00:47:55.661 --> 00:47:57.430
<v Speaker 1>particular domain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

877
00:47:57.431 --> 00:48:00.090
<v Speaker 1>if you want to be a salesperson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some extroversion is huge,</v>

878
00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:02.500
<v Speaker 1>is useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be a manager,</v>

879
00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:03.423
<v Speaker 1>it tends to be better if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable to some degree rather than </v>

880
00:48:05.951 --> 00:48:06.784
<v Speaker 1>if you're agreeable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be a nurse or a </v>

881
00:48:07.751 --> 00:48:09.550
<v Speaker 1>caretaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then agreeableness is useful.</v>

882
00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:12.580
<v Speaker 1>But the big performance predictors </v>
<v Speaker 1>across time,</v>

883
00:48:12.581 --> 00:48:17.581
<v Speaker 1>our intelligence and conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if the damn game is random,</v>

884
00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:20.403
<v Speaker 1>which the statistics seem to indicate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least that you can model it using </v>

885
00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:24.543
<v Speaker 1>processes that model random processes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why in the world do Iq and </v>

886
00:48:27.731 --> 00:48:30.010
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just stick with those two for now.</v>

887
00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:32.710
<v Speaker 1>Why in the world do they predict </v>
<v Speaker 1>success?</v>

888
00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:37.110
<v Speaker 1>So does anybody have any ideas about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

889
00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:39.030
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with Iq.</v>

890
00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:43.393
<v Speaker 1>Mean for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you apply your Iq to the stock </v>

891
00:48:44.861 --> 00:48:45.694
<v Speaker 1>market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I distribute do you all a bunch of </v>

892
00:48:47.291 --> 00:48:49.360
<v Speaker 1>money and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mentioned your Iq and I said,</v>

893
00:48:49.361 --> 00:48:52.060
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put together a portfolio.</v>

894
00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:55.690
<v Speaker 1>You get to pick 30 stocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't sell them for a year.</v>

895
00:48:55.691 --> 00:48:57.340
<v Speaker 1>You get to sell them at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

896
00:48:57.730 --> 00:48:58.563
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the probability that the high Iq </v>

897
00:49:00.581 --> 00:49:02.980
<v Speaker 1>people would pick a better set of stocks</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the low Iq?</v>

898
00:49:02.981 --> 00:49:06.190
<v Speaker 1>People</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer that as far as I can tell,</v>

899
00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.033
<v Speaker 1>is zero.</v>

900
00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:10.970
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to because you can't pick</v>

901
00:49:10.971 --> 00:49:12.740
<v Speaker 1>stocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out,</v>

902
00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:14.960
<v Speaker 1>all the information has already eaten </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

903
00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:16.231
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

904
00:49:16.231 --> 00:49:19.040
<v Speaker 1>and the stock market's an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>analogy of the environment,</v>

905
00:49:19.041 --> 00:49:19.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>

906
00:49:19.911 --> 00:49:20.744
<v Speaker 1>Because the stock market is basically an</v>
<v Speaker 1>index of continually transforming human </v>

907
00:49:24.261 --> 00:49:27.050
<v Speaker 1>economic and social environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's basically random.</v>

908
00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:29.630
<v Speaker 1>You can't predict the damn thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're smart.</v>

909
00:49:30.830 --> 00:49:33.410
<v Speaker 1>So why is it that smart people when </v>
<v Speaker 1>across time,</v>

910
00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:36.490
<v Speaker 1>and then again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it that hard working people cross</v>

911
00:49:36.491 --> 00:49:37.324
<v Speaker 1>time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be imagined each peg on the golden </v>

912
00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:43.370
<v Speaker 1>or as like a choice point in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then if people with a higher ed,</v>

913
00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:46.370
<v Speaker 1>you are more likely to choose the choice</v>
<v Speaker 1>point that will be done,</v>

914
00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:47.111
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

915
00:49:47.111 --> 00:49:49.630
<v Speaker 1>but that's only a restatement of what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>just said.</v>

916
00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:53.440
<v Speaker 1>It's not a causal account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're basically saying that the high Iq</v>

917
00:49:53.441 --> 00:49:55.030
<v Speaker 1>people make better choices.</v>

918
00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:56.013
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

919
00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:58.420
<v Speaker 1>if it's a random environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can they,</v>

920
00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:00.633
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking instead of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can view it as opportunities and </v>

921
00:50:03.701 --> 00:50:04.534
<v Speaker 1>genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which make somebody adoptable multiple </v>

922
00:50:06.671 --> 00:50:11.671
<v Speaker 1>environments and each coin flip as each </v>
<v Speaker 1>subsequent generation of that lineage.</v>

923
00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:18.120
<v Speaker 1>So that there is an increase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the more adoptable genetics,</v>

924
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:22.870
<v Speaker 1>emotional stability and situational </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth you have,</v>

925
00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:26.460
<v Speaker 1>the more likely your next generation has</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

926
00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:28.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they have to lose a lot more to get</v>

927
00:50:28.311 --> 00:50:29.540
<v Speaker 1>them to zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

928
00:50:29.541 --> 00:50:33.470
<v Speaker 1>So what about a given individual though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget about some being,</v>

929
00:50:33.471 --> 00:50:35.120
<v Speaker 1>forget about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Planning across time.</v>

930
00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:39.500
<v Speaker 1>And that's also a weird thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the single celled organisms that</v>

931
00:50:39.501 --> 00:50:41.960
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were your ancestors 3 billion years</v>

932
00:50:41.961 --> 00:50:46.310
<v Speaker 1>ago are still single celled organisms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas here you are,</v>

933
00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:47.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

934
00:50:47.271 --> 00:50:48.950
<v Speaker 1>same environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

935
00:50:48.951 --> 00:50:52.520
<v Speaker 1>So there's this tremendous branching of </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility across time.</v>

936
00:50:52.521 --> 00:50:54.470
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well Iq is adaptive,</v>

937
00:50:54.471 --> 00:50:55.760
<v Speaker 1>which is a terrible word.</v>

938
00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:57.050
<v Speaker 1>Adaptive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

939
00:50:57.051 --> 00:50:57.501
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

940
00:50:57.501 --> 00:50:59.780
<v Speaker 1>so how do you account for all the single</v>
<v Speaker 1>celled organisms?</v>

941
00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:02.000
<v Speaker 1>They're just not that bright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there they are.</v>

942
00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:03.133
<v Speaker 1>There's broad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more of them by weight than </v>

943
00:51:04.131 --> 00:51:04.964
<v Speaker 1>there are of us people by weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I probably think this out a bunch of </v>

944
00:51:08.841 --> 00:51:09.674
<v Speaker 1>different ways and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think about this and see what </v>

945
00:51:11.031 --> 00:51:11.864
<v Speaker 1>you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the first thing that seems to be </v>

946
00:51:13.121 --> 00:51:15.860
<v Speaker 1>to be the cases that you don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>play one game,</v>

947
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:17.983
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like imagine that you're sitting around </v>

948
00:51:18.801 --> 00:51:19.634
<v Speaker 1>with your friends and there were 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>board games going on and you can keep a </v>

949
00:51:24.021 --> 00:51:25.070
<v Speaker 1>hand in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in each of them.</v>

950
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Well then at some point in one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>board games,</v>

951
00:51:29.271 --> 00:51:31.400
<v Speaker 1>you're going to start to amass some </v>
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>

952
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:32.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just by chance.</v>

953
00:51:32.631 --> 00:51:37.490
<v Speaker 1>And if you're playing 50 board games in </v>
<v Speaker 1>25 of them after playing for some time,</v>

954
00:51:37.491 --> 00:51:38.570
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be at the top of it.</v>

955
00:51:38.810 --> 00:51:39.643
<v Speaker 1>You know when you're going to be moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the top 50% rather than the </v>

956
00:51:41.391 --> 00:51:43.610
<v Speaker 1>Bordeaux,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might say,</v>

957
00:51:43.611 --> 00:51:47.570
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>play 50 games played 20 turns.</v>

958
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:49.910
<v Speaker 1>Throw away the ones that you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst yet,</v>

959
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:51.223
<v Speaker 1>the 5% that you're doing the worst yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then just keep doing that until you </v>

960
00:51:54.501 --> 00:51:55.334
<v Speaker 1>end up with the one game that you win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you can do that better if you </v>

961
00:51:58.341 --> 00:52:02.340
<v Speaker 1>have high Iq cause you're faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you all you can.</v>

962
00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:06.260
<v Speaker 1>All that happens is that if you're smart</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you can play many games faster.</v>

963
00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:09.770
<v Speaker 1>And as a consequence of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can choose the ones that you seem to</v>

964
00:52:09.771 --> 00:52:10.604
<v Speaker 1>be winning and stick with those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe what happens with </v>

965
00:52:13.401 --> 00:52:16.250
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness is that you actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>stick to them.</v>

966
00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:21.570
<v Speaker 1>So that means that you actually don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to predict the future.</v>

967
00:52:21.571 --> 00:52:22.404
<v Speaker 1>In order to master it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that you have to simulate </v>

968
00:52:24.001 --> 00:52:26.970
<v Speaker 1>multiple futures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep your options open,</v>

969
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:30.940
<v Speaker 1>and sort of play dynamically as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment unfolds.</v>

970
00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:32.753
<v Speaker 1>So now it might be more complicated than</v>
<v Speaker 1>that because it's also possible that in </v>

971
00:52:37.741 --> 00:52:41.520
<v Speaker 1>some environments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least for local periods of time,</v>

972
00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:44.700
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the game is actually not random.</v>

973
00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:47.470
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

974
00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:48.313
<v Speaker 1>it's funny like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think money is the monopoly </v>

975
00:52:49.801 --> 00:52:50.634
<v Speaker 1>random?</v>

976
00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:53.573
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've all who everybody hears played </v>

977
00:52:54.871 --> 00:52:55.800
<v Speaker 1>monopoly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I presume,</v>

978
00:52:55.801 --> 00:52:57.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there anybody who hasn't?</v>

979
00:52:57.780 --> 00:52:58.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

980
00:52:58.480 --> 00:52:59.313
<v Speaker 1>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did the smart people win monopoly more </v>

981
00:53:00.601 --> 00:53:01.434
<v Speaker 1>often?</v>

982
00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:03.290
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the people that</v>

983
00:53:04.850 --> 00:53:05.683
<v Speaker 1>you do you think so you would say it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the conscientious people that win more </v>

984
00:53:07.911 --> 00:53:08.520
<v Speaker 1>often</v>

985
00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:09.730
<v Speaker 2>what each move too?</v>

986
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:12.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's pretty clear that you can,</v>

987
00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:15.330
<v Speaker 1>you can lose stupidly in monopoly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

988
00:53:15.331 --> 00:53:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Although I'm not sure if you can win </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligently,</v>

989
00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:21.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can avoid obviously bad choices.</v>

990
00:53:21.331 --> 00:53:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Like one choice would be don't buy any </v>
<v Speaker 1>property and just hold onto your money.</v>

991
00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:27.750
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be a losing strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

992
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:30.840
<v Speaker 1>So that'll wipe me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe another thing that smart people</v>

993
00:53:30.841 --> 00:53:34.320
<v Speaker 1>can do is that they don't do things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are self evidently.</v>

994
00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:36.330
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

995
00:53:36.330 --> 00:53:38.680
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that make it certain that you will lose.</v>

996
00:53:39.010 --> 00:53:41.530
<v Speaker 1>It might be something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

997
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:42.593
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things we might ask </v>

998
00:53:43.901 --> 00:53:48.901
<v Speaker 1>ourselves too is given that Iq and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness do predict success,</v>

999
00:53:50.501 --> 00:53:54.040
<v Speaker 1>how much success do they predict across </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk?</v>

1000
00:53:54.490 --> 00:53:59.490
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>they predict a substantial amount.</v>

1001
00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:06.580
<v Speaker 1>If you combine our Iq and personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you the equations.</v>

1002
00:54:07.071 --> 00:54:12.071
<v Speaker 1>These were formulated in the 1990s.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to look at this here.</v>

1003
00:54:13.431 --> 00:54:14.264
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1004
00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:16.430
<v Speaker 1>let me walk you through it a bit.</v>

1005
00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:18.900
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1006
00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:21.420
<v Speaker 1>so this is a spreadsheet I put together </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a long time ago.</v>

1007
00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:25.700
<v Speaker 2>It's a little bigger so you can see it.</v>

1008
00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:34.150
<v Speaker 1>So here's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the elements of the,</v>

1009
00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:38.930
<v Speaker 1>of the equation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need to know,</v>

1010
00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:40.243
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

1011
00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:46.500
<v Speaker 1>first element in equation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many people?</v>

1012
00:54:46.501 --> 00:54:47.311
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1013
00:54:47.311 --> 00:54:48.144
<v Speaker 1>how powerfully can you predict the </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance outcome of people across </v>

1014
00:54:51.031 --> 00:54:51.864
<v Speaker 1>time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And were they the value we're going to </v>

1015
00:54:53.961 --> 00:54:57.690
<v Speaker 1>use his dollar value and dollars are </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>

1016
00:54:58.260 --> 00:54:59.093
<v Speaker 1>they're sort of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're obviously they're the universal </v>

1017
00:55:01.501 --> 00:55:04.380
<v Speaker 1>currency because you can trade money in </v>
<v Speaker 1>for virtually anything.</v>

1018
00:55:04.381 --> 00:55:06.720
<v Speaker 1>So we use dollars as their standard of </v>
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>

1019
00:55:07.610 --> 00:55:09.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first question might be,</v>

1020
00:55:09.901 --> 00:55:10.734
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many people do you want to predict </v>

1021
00:55:11.701 --> 00:55:13.410
<v Speaker 1>for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say we're going to take 10.</v>

1022
00:55:13.411 --> 00:55:15.390
<v Speaker 1>So He'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we put that in this part of the equation</v>

1023
00:55:15.391 --> 00:55:16.650
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 people.</v>

1024
00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1025
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:22.890
<v Speaker 1>over what period of time do you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>calculate their success?</v>

1026
00:55:22.891 --> 00:55:23.724
<v Speaker 1>And one decent answer is five years </v>
<v Speaker 1>because people seem to stay in the same </v>

1027
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:32.100
<v Speaker 1>job position or career position for </v>
<v Speaker 1>about five years,</v>

1028
00:55:32.101 --> 00:55:34.620
<v Speaker 1>although that shortening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1029
00:55:34.621 --> 00:55:36.750
<v Speaker 1>so that's another thing that you guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>should keep in mind.</v>

1030
00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:37.603
<v Speaker 1>You probably not going to be in the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>position in your life for more than </v>

1031
00:55:39.991 --> 00:55:40.824
<v Speaker 1>about five years at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to plan and plot for </v>

1032
00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:49.910
<v Speaker 1>dynamic transformations in your career </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to do that in a way that,</v>

1033
00:55:50.010 --> 00:55:51.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1034
00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:52.673
<v Speaker 1>that works to your advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which partly means you have to keep </v>

1035
00:55:54.841 --> 00:55:57.450
<v Speaker 1>options open and you have to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say no.</v>

1036
00:55:58.320 --> 00:55:59.550
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1037
00:55:59.551 --> 00:56:01.980
<v Speaker 1>the next thing you might ask yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1038
00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:03.510
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how high a predictor,</v>

1039
00:56:03.511 --> 00:56:06.240
<v Speaker 1>what's the Roi for your predictor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the correlation coefficient?</v>

1040
00:56:06.241 --> 00:56:08.970
<v Speaker 1>And we put together a neuropsychological</v>
<v Speaker 1>battery.</v>

1041
00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I published the results of this with,</v>

1042
00:56:11.041 --> 00:56:11.874
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with uh,</v>

1043
00:56:12.070 --> 00:56:12.903
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1044
00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:16.050
<v Speaker 1>someone named Dan Daniel Higgins quite a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time ago.</v>

1045
00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:17.063
<v Speaker 1>We used neuropsychological battery </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at dorsal lateral prefrontal </v>

1046
00:56:20.161 --> 00:56:20.994
<v Speaker 1>ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we thought of as something </v>

1047
00:56:22.141 --> 00:56:22.974
<v Speaker 1>potentially from fluid intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which problem but which probably just </v>

1048
00:56:26.141 --> 00:56:29.200
<v Speaker 1>turned out to be quite a good measure of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fluid intelligence.</v>

1049
00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:30.303
<v Speaker 1>And we also used conscientiousness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we found that when we validated that in </v>

1050
00:56:33.791 --> 00:56:34.624
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we validated it in a factory and we </v>

1051
00:56:38.051 --> 00:56:38.884
<v Speaker 1>looked at the performance of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>administrators and managers in the </v>

1052
00:56:41.381 --> 00:56:42.214
<v Speaker 1>factory because they had relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex jobs and we had access to seven </v>

1053
00:56:45.491 --> 00:56:46.324
<v Speaker 1>years of their performance records,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which someone else had gathered </v>

1054
00:56:48.341 --> 00:56:49.174
<v Speaker 1>independently of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what we found was that for those </v>

1055
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:56.320
<v Speaker 1>people who had performance records that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were more than four years old,</v>

1056
00:56:56.530 --> 00:56:57.363
<v Speaker 1>we could predict their performance at </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 0.59 about about 0.6 tremendously </v>

1057
00:57:03.131 --> 00:57:03.964
<v Speaker 1>powerful prediction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now one of the things we found was that </v>

1058
00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:07.443
<v Speaker 1>the degree to which our predictions were</v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate increased with the increase in </v>

1059
00:57:10.661 --> 00:57:13.420
<v Speaker 1>the number of years of performance data </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have.</v>

1060
00:57:13.690 --> 00:57:14.441
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1061
00:57:14.441 --> 00:57:18.390
<v Speaker 1>if I want to predict how you do next </v>
<v Speaker 1>year and then I'd get a performance it,</v>

1062
00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:23.230
<v Speaker 1>you enter a new job and I get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance index after your first year,</v>

1063
00:57:23.290 --> 00:57:24.123
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to be able to predict out </v>
<v Speaker 1>very well from your intelligence and </v>

1064
00:57:26.411 --> 00:57:27.244
<v Speaker 1>your conscientiousness because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure of your performance actually </v>

1065
00:57:30.041 --> 00:57:30.874
<v Speaker 1>won't be very good because it turns out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can't even figure out how well </v>

1066
00:57:33.941 --> 00:57:37.600
<v Speaker 1>someone is performing in a job until </v>
<v Speaker 1>about three years.</v>

1067
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:40.810
<v Speaker 1>So it turns out that if you take a </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex job on,</v>

1068
00:57:41.410 --> 00:57:42.243
<v Speaker 1>you get better and better at it over </v>
<v Speaker 1>three years if you're going to get </v>

1069
00:57:44.441 --> 00:57:45.274
<v Speaker 1>better and better at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we can't tell how well you're </v>

1070
00:57:46.811 --> 00:57:49.600
<v Speaker 1>doing until about that period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another thing that's useful to</v>

1071
00:57:49.601 --> 00:57:50.770
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

1072
00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:54.430
<v Speaker 1>when you guys go off to find your next </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex role in life,</v>

1073
00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:55.563
<v Speaker 1>you can't really expect to be good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're going to do until about </v>

1074
00:57:58.151 --> 00:58:00.520
<v Speaker 1>three years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After about four years,</v>

1075
00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:03.100
<v Speaker 1>additional experience doesn't seem to </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

1076
00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:04.593
<v Speaker 1>So that's also worth knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to feel like a bloody </v>

1077
00:58:06.401 --> 00:58:09.880
<v Speaker 1>moron for the first bit of your new job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because you are,</v>

1078
00:58:09.881 --> 00:58:11.530
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1079
00:58:11.531 --> 00:58:13.570
<v Speaker 1>if you keep at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll accrue,</v>

1080
00:58:14.070 --> 00:58:15.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience and,</v>

1081
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:18.820
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and expertise quite rapidly over a three</v>

1082
00:58:18.821 --> 00:58:19.654
<v Speaker 1>year period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's probably the right amount of </v>

1083
00:58:21.551 --> 00:58:22.384
<v Speaker 1>time over which to evaluate your </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance because you need to know </v>

1084
00:58:25.061 --> 00:58:25.720
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1085
00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:29.110
<v Speaker 1>Should you be freaking out if after six </v>
<v Speaker 1>months you're not doing a good job,</v>

1086
00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:32.680
<v Speaker 1>well you got to see how you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to your peers.</v>

1087
00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:35.650
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully you're not doing a worse job </v>
<v Speaker 1>than them,</v>

1088
00:58:35.651 --> 00:58:36.484
<v Speaker 1>but if it's a complex job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to take you a long time to </v>

1089
00:58:38.231 --> 00:58:39.820
<v Speaker 1>master it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1090
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:40.780
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

1091
00:58:40.781 --> 00:58:41.614
<v Speaker 1>our predictor was 0.59,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we are pretty damn thrilled about </v>

1092
00:58:44.890 --> 00:58:45.723
<v Speaker 1>and we are comparing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to compare that to a </v>

1093
00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:52.150
<v Speaker 1>comparison predictor of zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For now zero is random.</v>

1094
00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:55.510
<v Speaker 1>So if I was going to predict your </v>
<v Speaker 1>trajectory through life,</v>

1095
00:58:55.511 --> 00:58:57.820
<v Speaker 1>let's say I want to predict your </v>
<v Speaker 1>industrial productivity.</v>

1096
00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:59.890
<v Speaker 1>I'll take 10 of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>

1097
00:59:00.250 --> 00:59:03.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to predict your industrial </v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity over the next five years.</v>

1098
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.290
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll be the goal.</v>

1099
00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or we can do this.</v>

1100
00:59:08.711 --> 00:59:10.630
<v Speaker 1>I will do this a slightly different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1101
00:59:10.631 --> 00:59:11.110
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>

1102
00:59:11.110 --> 00:59:14.080
<v Speaker 1>So that's the selection ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last one is the selection ratio.</v>

1103
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:16.210
<v Speaker 1>So let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1104
00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:20.530
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to select you guys for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>position at a,</v>

1105
00:59:20.730 --> 00:59:22.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you're going to be managers in</v>

1106
00:59:22.371 --> 00:59:23.450
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

1107
00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:27.440
<v Speaker 1>in a relatively complex corporate </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>

1108
00:59:27.441 --> 00:59:31.610
<v Speaker 1>there's about 110 of you or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that in here.</v>

1109
00:59:31.611 --> 00:59:35.210
<v Speaker 1>Now maybe let's say a hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say I'm going to pick 10 of you.</v>

1110
00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:39.470
<v Speaker 1>That means my selection ratio is right </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1111
00:59:39.471 --> 00:59:40.760
<v Speaker 1>It's one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1112
00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:45.800
<v Speaker 1>it's one in 10 that you can transform </v>
<v Speaker 1>that into a standard score of 1.76.</v>

1113
00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:47.233
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important to know how many people </v>

1114
00:59:48.831 --> 00:59:49.664
<v Speaker 1>you get to choose from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're going to hire one </v>

1115
00:59:52.221 --> 00:59:53.054
<v Speaker 1>person and you only have one applicant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot of sense doing any </v>

1116
00:59:55.671 --> 00:59:58.280
<v Speaker 1>selection because you only have one </v>
<v Speaker 1>applicant.</v>

1117
00:59:58.281 --> 01:00:00.310
<v Speaker 1>So I don't care how much you knew about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that person.</v>

1118
01:00:00.311 --> 01:00:02.090
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to be helpful if you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hire them.</v>

1119
01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:03.283
<v Speaker 1>But in this situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to assume that I can screen </v>

1120
01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:09.170
<v Speaker 1>all 100 of you and only recommend 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1121
01:00:09.770 --> 01:00:14.770
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to assume you have to put</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a variable for job complexity because</v>

1122
01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:16.513
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 1>and conscientiousness increases the </v>

1123
01:00:19.731 --> 01:00:20.564
<v Speaker 1>relationship between intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness and predictive power </v>

1124
01:00:23.031 --> 01:00:25.760
<v Speaker 1>increases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the job becomes more complicated,</v>

1125
01:00:26.070 --> 01:00:27.830
<v Speaker 1>she's is exactly what you'd expect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1126
01:00:28.070 --> 01:00:32.150
<v Speaker 1>So if you can do a job by wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that Iq would conscientiousness will</v>

1127
01:00:32.151 --> 01:00:36.560
<v Speaker 1>predict is how fast you can learn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if it's a dynamic job where you have</v>

1128
01:00:36.561 --> 01:00:38.810
<v Speaker 1>to make decisions not on a nonstop </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis,</v>

1129
01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:39.913
<v Speaker 1>then Iq and conscientiousness are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to predict your performance over the </v>

1130
01:00:42.411 --> 01:00:43.244
<v Speaker 1>long run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to assume that you're in </v>

1131
01:00:44.601 --> 01:00:45.434
<v Speaker 1>a complex job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna assume that you have an </v>

1132
01:00:47.061 --> 01:00:52.061
<v Speaker 1>annual salary of $75,000 so then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question is armed with that knowledge,</v>

1133
01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:54.733
<v Speaker 1>how much money would the company that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>using my products obtain by using the </v>

1134
01:01:01.521 --> 01:01:05.390
<v Speaker 1>selection compared to with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they just picked 10 of you randomly,</v>

1135
01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:10.780
<v Speaker 1>and the answer is right there</v>
<v Speaker 1>in five years</v>

1136
01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:18.050
<v Speaker 1>they would have made $4 million more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than they would've if they would've just</v>

1137
01:01:18.051 --> 01:01:18.884
<v Speaker 1>picked randomly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that would be a productivity </v>

1138
01:01:20.931 --> 01:01:22.700
<v Speaker 1>increase of 104%</v>

1139
01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:29.200
<v Speaker 1>so there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's graft here.</v>

1140
01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:32.273
<v Speaker 1>So with random selection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50% of the people you hire are going to </v>

1141
01:01:36.961 --> 01:01:39.570
<v Speaker 1>be above average and 50% are going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>below.</v>

1142
01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:40.763
<v Speaker 1>And using a good psychometric battery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get that to vote 80 20 and the </v>

1143
01:01:45.121 --> 01:01:50.121
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>$4 million in increased productivity.</v>

1144
01:01:50.581 --> 01:01:52.590
<v Speaker 1>So now we're going to turn that into one</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1145
01:01:55.780 --> 01:02:00.430
<v Speaker 1>So over five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you selection processes properly,</v>

1146
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.410
<v Speaker 1>you make $400,000 more by hiring one </v>
<v Speaker 1>better person,</v>

1147
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:11.130
<v Speaker 1>it's $40,000 it's what is that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>$100,000 a year?</v>

1148
01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.410
<v Speaker 1>It's actually more than you're paying </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in salary.</v>

1149
01:02:14.550 --> 01:02:17.130
<v Speaker 1>And now the reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of reasons.</v>

1150
01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:22.080
<v Speaker 1>The first reason is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there are tremendous amounts.</v>

1151
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:25.350
<v Speaker 1>There's tremendous differences in </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual productivity.</v>

1152
01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:26.393
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's weird about </v>

1153
01:02:27.211 --> 01:02:31.830
<v Speaker 1>these formulas is this formula is </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicated on the idea that productivity</v>

1154
01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:32.903
<v Speaker 1>is actually normally distributed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually productivity is prieto </v>

1155
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:37.703
<v Speaker 1>distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is that the basic </v>

1156
01:02:39.871 --> 01:02:40.704
<v Speaker 1>consequence of using this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>prediction is probably higher than this </v>

1157
01:02:44.311 --> 01:02:46.290
<v Speaker 1>formula indicates.</v>

1158
01:02:47.650 --> 01:02:48.483
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1159
01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:04.010
<v Speaker 1>there's a variety of reasons to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This.</v>

1160
01:03:04.011 --> 01:03:04.844
<v Speaker 1>One is obviously the practical idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The practical idea is of what use is it </v>

1161
01:03:09.651 --> 01:03:10.484
<v Speaker 1>knowing something about the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to hire and that's or work </v>

1162
01:03:13.791 --> 01:03:14.624
<v Speaker 1>with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is it depends on </v>

1163
01:03:15.561 --> 01:03:16.394
<v Speaker 1>what you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if the things that you know are </v>

1164
01:03:18.801 --> 01:03:22.880
<v Speaker 1>valid and they include personality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

1165
01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:28.660
<v Speaker 1>it's not only valuable to know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's virtually vital because the success</v>

1166
01:03:29.991 --> 01:03:34.220
<v Speaker 1>of your enterprise will depend on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that you hire an associate with.</v>

1167
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:40.040
<v Speaker 1>The second thing is I think that knowing</v>
<v Speaker 1>this should change the way that you look</v>

1168
01:03:40.041 --> 01:03:40.874
<v Speaker 1>at the world.</v>

1169
01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:44.053
<v Speaker 1>If you understand that the outcomes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>life are distributed on a prieto </v>

1170
01:03:48.111 --> 01:03:48.944
<v Speaker 1>distribution and that there are in belt </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperamental factors that play an </v>

1171
01:03:53.901 --> 01:03:58.190
<v Speaker 1>important role in determining that one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the problems that you have before you</v>

1172
01:03:58.191 --> 01:04:01.280
<v Speaker 1>as modern people is what the hell do you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do about that?</v>

1173
01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:02.900
<v Speaker 1>From a conceptual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social,</v>

1174
01:04:02.901 --> 01:04:03.734
<v Speaker 1>political and economic perspective?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because nobody who's currently </v>

1175
01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:09.673
<v Speaker 1>considering how societies are structured</v>
<v Speaker 1>pays any attention to this sort of </v>

1176
01:04:13.341 --> 01:04:14.174
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't assume that there are </v>

1177
01:04:15.531 --> 01:04:18.830
<v Speaker 1>differences between people with regards </v>
<v Speaker 1>to their life outcome chances,</v>

1178
01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:19.723
<v Speaker 1>not of this sort of magnitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so none of the social policies that </v>

1179
01:04:23.241 --> 01:04:24.074
<v Speaker 1>we have in place reflect any of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say like our </v>

1180
01:04:28.071 --> 01:04:28.904
<v Speaker 1>psychometrics are 21st century in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>political and economic theories are </v>

1181
01:04:31.941 --> 01:04:32.774
<v Speaker 1>basically 17th century and it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good thing and you guys are going to </v>

1182
01:04:36.201 --> 01:04:37.034
<v Speaker 1>suffer for this or benefit from it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because as society becomes more </v>

1183
01:04:40.911 --> 01:04:44.390
<v Speaker 1>technological and as it transforms more </v>
<v Speaker 1>and more rapidly,</v>

1184
01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:45.523
<v Speaker 1>the degree to which the prieto </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution is going to kick in is </v>

1185
01:04:48.051 --> 01:04:49.310
<v Speaker 1>going to increase.</v>

1186
01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:50.353
<v Speaker 1>Now you already see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why that the separation between </v>

1187
01:04:55.341 --> 01:04:56.174
<v Speaker 1>rich and poor in industrialized </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries is becoming increasingly </v>

1188
01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:01.880
<v Speaker 1>severe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1189
01:05:02.090 --> 01:05:02.923
<v Speaker 1>that's modified by some degree to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fat by the fact that the middle class </v>

1190
01:05:07.161 --> 01:05:10.760
<v Speaker 1>worldwide is growing like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a really good thing.</v>

1191
01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.300
<v Speaker 1>But still the longterm plays the prieto </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>

1192
01:05:14.301 --> 01:05:18.520
<v Speaker 1>and it's partly because an person is one</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

1193
01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:21.990
<v Speaker 1>but an intelligent person with infinite </v>
<v Speaker 1>computational power.</v>

1194
01:05:22.010 --> 01:05:25.090
<v Speaker 1>That's a completely different thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's where we're headed.</v>

1195
01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:29.230
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know exactly what to make of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all this sort of thing politically,</v>

1196
01:05:29.231 --> 01:05:32.140
<v Speaker 1>but I know that to the degree that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignore it,</v>

1197
01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:38.040
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have very unhappy and and</v>
<v Speaker 1>unstable societies.</v>

1198
01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:43.150
<v Speaker 1>So we'll see you Thursday on that happy </v>
<v Speaker 1>note.</v>

1199
01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:44.250
<v Speaker 2>Let's see you Thursday.</v>
