1
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.280
<v Speaker 1>Thank you ms Dot Peterson for being with</v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.970
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for the invitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.383
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I found most interesting in your </v>

4
00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:14.690
<v Speaker 1>book is the stuff you write about child </v>
<v Speaker 1>development and child upbringing and for</v>

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.533
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you explain how overprotective parents </v>

6
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.220
<v Speaker 1>contaminants that are children who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.490
<v Speaker 1>you say it's far better to run beings in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your care,</v>

8
00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:25.020
<v Speaker 1>competent on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to protect them.</v>

9
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.123
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that parents today are more</v>
<v Speaker 1>protective of their children than </v>

10
00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:35.010
<v Speaker 1>previous generations?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that it looks like that.</v>

11
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.873
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are complex reasons for </v>

12
00:00:37.261 --> 00:00:38.094
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that you can necessarily </v>

13
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.063
<v Speaker 1>lay that at the feet of the parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are having fewer children and </v>

14
00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:49.440
<v Speaker 1>they're having them later in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think both of those things,</v>

15
00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:50.274
<v Speaker 1>those are major demographic shifts and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that one of the consequences of </v>

16
00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:56.760
<v Speaker 1>that is the children's lives are much </v>
<v Speaker 1>more organized than they used to be,</v>

17
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.300
<v Speaker 1>which might have some advantages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that also parents are more likely to</v>

18
00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:01.134
<v Speaker 1>overprotect they're older and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>cautious and the children also don't </v>

19
00:01:05.101 --> 00:01:05.934
<v Speaker 1>have as many siblings and of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>siblings were part of the child raising </v>

20
00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:09.750
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

21
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.583
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's hard to be over protected in </v>

22
00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:15.420
<v Speaker 1>some ways when you're competing with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of siblings.</v>

23
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.643
<v Speaker 1>So it's complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that overprotection is a </v>

24
00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Room 11 is to not politics when they are</v>

25
00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:26.460
<v Speaker 1>skateboarding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a recurring theme in your book.</v>

26
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.013
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we are over protective with our </v>

27
00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:30.774
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will create weak individuals while </v>

28
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.790
<v Speaker 1>you demolish people's resilience that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

29
00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:40.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean life is difficult and you cannot </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect your children.</v>

30
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:41.783
<v Speaker 1>What you can do is prepare them and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can prepare them to be strong and </v>

31
00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:45.594
<v Speaker 1>courageous and truthful and resilient </v>
<v Speaker 1>and reciprocal in their interactions </v>

32
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:51.384
<v Speaker 1>with other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means you equip them for what </v>

33
00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:54.894
<v Speaker 1>life will be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is at minimum a series of </v>

34
00:01:56.911 --> 00:01:58.050
<v Speaker 1>difficult challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

35
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.450
<v Speaker 1>and often more than that because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>

36
00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:05.310
<v Speaker 1>people go through very difficult times </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their lives and a resilient person is</v>

37
00:02:05.311 --> 00:02:10.311
<v Speaker 1>capable of standing up to things in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>face of fear and moving forward,</v>

38
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.010
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily convinced of their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>competence and ability to prevail.</v>

39
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.190
<v Speaker 1>And so the primary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your primary goal as a parent,</v>

40
00:02:20.191 --> 00:02:24.360
<v Speaker 1>apart from facilitating your child's </v>
<v Speaker 1>social desirability,</v>

41
00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:27.420
<v Speaker 1>which is a major obligation on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>part,</v>

42
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.283
<v Speaker 1>is to encourage your children into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean that literally to instill in </v>

43
00:02:32.101 --> 00:02:32.934
<v Speaker 1>them a sense of courage in the face of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the difficulties of life and not to </v>

44
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:37.164
<v Speaker 1>protect them from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't even want to be protected from </v>

45
00:02:39.631 --> 00:02:44.631
<v Speaker 1>those difficulties because a major part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of life and its meaning is the,</v>

46
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.390
<v Speaker 1>the challenge that comes with </v>
<v Speaker 1>confronting difficulties.</v>

47
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.050
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to say to those parents</v>

48
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.973
<v Speaker 1>that allow their eight or nine year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>sons to sleep in their beds at night </v>

49
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.910
<v Speaker 1>instead of sleeping in their own rooms?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

50
00:02:58.911 --> 00:02:59.744
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing I would say about that </v>

51
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 1>is you might want to ask why you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want privacy with your spouse.</v>

52
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.633
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last thing you want to do is use </v>

53
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 1>your child as an excuse to not interact </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly with your wife or your husband.</v>

54
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.113
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of reasons that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>allow their children to interfere with </v>

55
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:20.470
<v Speaker 1>their relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so and by eight or nine,</v>

56
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:21.693
<v Speaker 1>a child is more than capable of spending</v>
<v Speaker 1>time on their own and they need to do </v>

57
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:25.954
<v Speaker 1>that anyways because you don't want your</v>
<v Speaker 1>child to be either unable to spend time </v>

58
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:30.694
<v Speaker 1>alone or terrified debit you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also destroyed to some degree their </v>

59
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.280
<v Speaker 1>while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their ability to cope on their own,</v>

60
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 1>but also their imagination by not </v>
<v Speaker 1>requiring them to rely on themselves for</v>

61
00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:45.550
<v Speaker 1>their own like co two for self calming </v>
<v Speaker 1>and safe.</v>

62
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:46.443
<v Speaker 1>And also for self amusement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a rule when you're dealing with </v>

63
00:03:49.241 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 1>people who might be dependent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this includes includes the situation</v>

64
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:56.230
<v Speaker 1>where you're dealing with sick people or</v>
<v Speaker 1>or elderly people,</v>

65
00:03:56.231 --> 00:03:57.064
<v Speaker 1>and the rule is do not do anything for </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone that they can do for themselves </v>

66
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.430
<v Speaker 1>because you take away their competence.</v>

67
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.263
<v Speaker 1>By doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to ask you about the use of </v>

68
00:04:07.211 --> 00:04:08.044
<v Speaker 1>physical force on children because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it is important to allow kids to </v>

69
00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:13.360
<v Speaker 1>explore and harm themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get experience.</v>

70
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.390
<v Speaker 1>Stiller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>belief,</v>

71
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:15.223
<v Speaker 1>strict parenting is important and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it is justifiable to flick the </v>

72
00:04:18.941 --> 00:04:21.550
<v Speaker 1>index finger to certain types of two </v>
<v Speaker 1>year olds.</v>

73
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Why use the use of force justifiable in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bulletin change on the context,</v>

74
00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:28.090
<v Speaker 1>and it also depends on what you mean by </v>
<v Speaker 1>force.</v>

75
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.163
<v Speaker 1>There isn't a disciplinary strategy that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can utilize that doesn't involve </v>

76
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.110
<v Speaker 1>something that's unpleasant while you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can use reward,</v>

77
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.153
<v Speaker 1>but that that's a different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's different circumstances under </v>

78
00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:41.230
<v Speaker 1>way and you should use reward every time</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can because it's more effective,</v>

79
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:42.064
<v Speaker 1>but you often need something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantaneous and that gets the message </v>

80
00:04:46.121 --> 00:04:46.954
<v Speaker 1>across.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a flick is a very good technique </v>

81
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.850
<v Speaker 1>because it's instant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's harmless,</v>

82
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.260
<v Speaker 1>it gets the message across.</v>

83
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.320
<v Speaker 1>You can use it publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can't be misused,</v>

84
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.940
<v Speaker 1>you won't hurt the child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

85
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:00.803
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to have an effective </v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplinary strategy for you since in </v>

86
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:05.290
<v Speaker 1>social situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

87
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.170
<v Speaker 1>you talked about the minimizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>minimums.</v>

88
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.173
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the basic rules are quite </v>

89
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.943
<v Speaker 1>straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Minimum number of rules because </v>

90
00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:17.380
<v Speaker 1>otherwise the enforcement costs accrue </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you end up constraining yourself and</v>

91
00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:20.500
<v Speaker 1>the child too much and then minimal </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary force.</v>

92
00:05:20.501 --> 00:05:21.340
<v Speaker 1>And you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

93
00:05:21.341 --> 00:05:24.460
<v Speaker 1>what's minimal necessary force?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>

94
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.003
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>minimum intervention necessary to bring </v>

95
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.590
<v Speaker 1>the behavior to a halt as rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And harmlessly as possible,</v>

96
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:33.483
<v Speaker 1>and that has to be negotiated with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>child because some children are much </v>

97
00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:38.850
<v Speaker 1>more difficult to stop than others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but isn't the political divide.</v>

98
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.080
<v Speaker 1>The Pot and child relationship can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>diamonds.</v>

99
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.310
<v Speaker 1>If basic trust and safety is lost or </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely the case that it's,</v>

100
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.840
<v Speaker 1>it will be damaged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

101
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.883
<v Speaker 1>but the application of judicious </v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplinary force doesn't damage the </v>

102
00:05:52.181 --> 00:05:52.810
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

103
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.000
<v Speaker 1>It actually strengthens it and everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows this.</v>

104
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.163
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if if you have a relationship with your </v>

105
00:05:58.881 --> 00:05:59.714
<v Speaker 1>wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say the relationship is partly </v>

106
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.470
<v Speaker 1>based on mutual respect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not merely on mutual love,</v>

107
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.260
<v Speaker 1>it's also based on mutual respect and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

108
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.573
<v Speaker 1>Everyone tests out there partner to </v>
<v Speaker 1>determine what their limits are and if </v>

109
00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:18.890
<v Speaker 1>you're not some subject to corrective </v>
<v Speaker 1>action on the part of your partner,</v>

110
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.173
<v Speaker 1>you will have no respect for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your relationship will deteriorate very </v>

111
00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:23.594
<v Speaker 1>rapidly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's very important to understand </v>

112
00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:27.074
<v Speaker 1>that the limits that you place on </v>
<v Speaker 1>children are not something that impede </v>

113
00:06:30.321 --> 00:06:34.040
<v Speaker 1>the child parent relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually further it substantially.</v>

114
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.390
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk about John Three quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>now and chapter 11.</v>

115
00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:39.224
<v Speaker 1>You write the ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the soul called oppression of the </v>

116
00:06:41.061 --> 00:06:41.894
<v Speaker 1>patriarchy and you ride it loose to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the sole colt oppression or the </v>

117
00:06:45.001 --> 00:06:46.290
<v Speaker 1>patriarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

118
00:06:46.291 --> 00:06:47.124
<v Speaker 1>Start on imperfect collective attempt by</v>
<v Speaker 1>men and women stretching over millennia </v>

119
00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:51.284
<v Speaker 1>to free each,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all different providers and disease and </v>

120
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.610
<v Speaker 1>so the oppression of women happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was practical.</v>

121
00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.700
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the,</v>

122
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:00.543
<v Speaker 1>the oppression of men and women happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>because life is difficult and </v>

123
00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:05.324
<v Speaker 1>treacherous and so we were subject and </v>
<v Speaker 1>still are to all sorts of terrible </v>

124
00:07:09.681 --> 00:07:12.230
<v Speaker 1>burdens that are intrinsic to life </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself in.</v>

125
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.333
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that's happened is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're so technically in </v>

126
00:07:16.131 --> 00:07:16.964
<v Speaker 1>materially wealthy right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't understand what privations our </v>

127
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.450
<v Speaker 1>ancestors even a few generations ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>faced.</v>

128
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was very difficult for women </v>
<v Speaker 1>to function,</v>

129
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.670
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as as technical equals in the absence of</v>

130
00:07:31.671 --> 00:07:35.750
<v Speaker 1>reliable control of menstruation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's only been a reality for say,</v>

131
00:07:35.751 --> 00:07:36.584
<v Speaker 1>70 years and the birth control pill as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well as a major technological </v>

132
00:07:40.101 --> 00:07:42.620
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mentioned technological advancement.</v>

133
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.513
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you hotels have been removed in </v>

134
00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:46.664
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you talk about the shoal cult </v>

135
00:07:47.841 --> 00:07:52.280
<v Speaker 1>oppression of the patriarchy that women </v>
<v Speaker 1>were oppressed for centuries.</v>

136
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:52.731
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

137
00:07:52.731 --> 00:07:53.564
<v Speaker 1>that's one way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other way of looking at it is that </v>

138
00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:57.860
<v Speaker 1>men and women were oppressed for </v>
<v Speaker 1>centuries.</v>

139
00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.053
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are certain burdens that women </v>

140
00:08:00.171 --> 00:08:03.440
<v Speaker 1>bore that men didn't bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the opposite is equally true.</v>

141
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:04.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in suffered dreadfully,</v>

142
00:08:04.911 --> 00:08:08.000
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in incredibly dangerous occupations,</v>

143
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's the fact that women suffered </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than than men.</v>

144
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one.</v>

145
00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:12.374
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it is a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that most people suffered by </v>

146
00:08:15.681 --> 00:08:17.960
<v Speaker 1>modern standards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it measurably,</v>

147
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.310
<v Speaker 1>and that I don't buy the historical </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative,</v>

148
00:08:22.311 --> 00:08:23.144
<v Speaker 1>that the fundamental reality of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>history was that men were oppressing </v>

149
00:08:26.421 --> 00:08:27.171
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

150
00:08:27.171 --> 00:08:30.110
<v Speaker 1>women aren't that easy to oppress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you might've noticed,</v>

151
00:08:30.111 --> 00:08:33.710
<v Speaker 1>if you've ever had a relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and you might say,</v>

152
00:08:33.711 --> 00:08:34.544
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took women a long time to struggle </v>

153
00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:38.810
<v Speaker 1>forward until they attained civil rights</v>
<v Speaker 1>status.</v>

154
00:08:38.811 --> 00:08:41.090
<v Speaker 1>That was equivalent to men and I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that's true,</v>

155
00:08:41.091 --> 00:08:41.924
<v Speaker 1>but it also was the case for men that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>took very long time to struggle forward </v>

156
00:08:45.681 --> 00:08:46.514
<v Speaker 1>before there was anything approximating </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual rights and that they were </v>

157
00:08:49.311 --> 00:08:53.150
<v Speaker 1>granted to women quite rapidly in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>aftermath of that and that a lot of that</v>

158
00:08:53.151 --> 00:08:53.984
<v Speaker 1>was a consequence of technological </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation that made that sort of </v>

159
00:08:57.661 --> 00:09:00.510
<v Speaker 1>thing even possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we are both privileged.</v>

160
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.290
<v Speaker 1>White males can be really understand the</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering of women.</v>

161
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how.</v>

162
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:11.750
<v Speaker 1>How useful your your capacity for </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding the suffering of others is</v>

163
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:12.773
<v Speaker 1>or how well developed that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see that it's necessarily any </v>

164
00:09:15.481 --> 00:09:18.450
<v Speaker 1>more difficult to understand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering of women.</v>

165
00:09:18.451 --> 00:09:20.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never pose the question that way</v>

166
00:09:20.311 --> 00:09:21.144
<v Speaker 1>because I don't know how you understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>the suffering of a group being an </v>

167
00:09:23.731 --> 00:09:27.060
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think a woman can understand the</v>

168
00:09:27.061 --> 00:09:29.460
<v Speaker 1>suffering of women because that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

169
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.353
<v Speaker 1>That's predicated on the assumption that</v>
<v Speaker 1>an individual can take on the burden of </v>

170
00:09:33.601 --> 00:09:35.790
<v Speaker 1>a group and I don't buy that assumption </v>
<v Speaker 1>to begin with.</v>

171
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.960
<v Speaker 1>I think we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We very in the ability to,</v>

172
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.120
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>empathize with others,</v>

173
00:09:42.121 --> 00:09:42.954
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think there's any evidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever that you can't empathize </v>

174
00:09:45.841 --> 00:09:46.674
<v Speaker 1>across a gender barrier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise no relationship would even be </v>

175
00:09:48.541 --> 00:09:49.374
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people aren't given the </v>

176
00:09:50.041 --> 00:09:53.370
<v Speaker 1>cultural oppression is still a fact in </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern society.</v>

177
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:54.690
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

178
00:09:54.691 --> 00:09:57.540
<v Speaker 1>something feminine is Conservative and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shopping.</v>

179
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.000
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't that sustain the oppression of </v>
<v Speaker 1>women?</v>

180
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:01.643
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there are negative </v>

181
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:04.493
<v Speaker 1>stereotypes associated with both forms </v>
<v Speaker 1>of gendered behavior and that if those </v>

182
00:10:08.431 --> 00:10:09.264
<v Speaker 1>are utilized inappropriately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can result in prejudicial </v>

183
00:10:12.901 --> 00:10:13.734
<v Speaker 1>attitudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that most enterprises are </v>

184
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:21.030
<v Speaker 1>imperfect enough so that some residual </v>
<v Speaker 1>prejudice remains.</v>

185
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:22.223
<v Speaker 1>It might be sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be preferenced by gender or </v>

186
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:27.240
<v Speaker 1>prejudice by gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be prejudice by race,</v>

187
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:28.403
<v Speaker 1>might be prejudice by ethnicity or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or attractiveness or intelligence or </v>

188
00:10:31.681 --> 00:10:32.514
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of things that warp </v>

189
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.023
<v Speaker 1>the proper subjectivity of hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we're doing an unbelievably </v>

190
00:10:41.071 --> 00:10:41.904
<v Speaker 1>good job at getting rid of those as </v>
<v Speaker 1>rapidly as is humanly possible and that </v>

191
00:10:44.641 --> 00:10:45.474
<v Speaker 1>we've moved so fast in that direction so</v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly that we deserve some credit for </v>

192
00:10:48.841 --> 00:10:49.680
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

193
00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.593
<v Speaker 1>there's one line in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you say you don't agree with the </v>

194
00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.780
<v Speaker 1>theory of the Feminist Revolution of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>20th century,</v>

195
00:10:54.781 --> 00:10:55.614
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the fact that the feminist </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement of the 20th century had a </v>

196
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:03.330
<v Speaker 1>significant impact for gender equality?</v>

197
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:04.620
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really think so.</v>

198
00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.680
<v Speaker 1>What I will see my thing was equal pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about,</v>

199
00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.390
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened in the sixties?</v>

200
00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.330
<v Speaker 1>I think that I think that to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to lay that to the,</v>

201
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.193
<v Speaker 1>to attribute that primarily to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminist political movement is to give </v>

202
00:11:17.641 --> 00:11:18.474
<v Speaker 1>far more credit to the feminist </v>
<v Speaker 1>political movement than it deserves and </v>

203
00:11:21.481 --> 00:11:24.120
<v Speaker 1>I think the people who are pushing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are primarily feminists.</v>

204
00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:25.163
<v Speaker 1>I think that most of what freed women </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the extension of the idea of </v>

205
00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:30.564
<v Speaker 1>individual rights to everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including women and that that was </v>

206
00:11:33.841 --> 00:11:37.050
<v Speaker 1>happening not only on the on the front </v>
<v Speaker 1>of women let's say,</v>

207
00:11:37.051 --> 00:11:40.950
<v Speaker 1>but also with regards to people of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different races and ethnicities.</v>

208
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:41.933
<v Speaker 1>I think it's part of a much broader </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural movement to extend the idea of </v>

209
00:11:44.941 --> 00:11:45.774
<v Speaker 1>individual rights universally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's deeply embedded in the </v>

210
00:11:48.631 --> 00:11:49.464
<v Speaker 1>Judeo Christian tradition and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that a very large number of </v>

211
00:11:53.201 --> 00:11:54.034
<v Speaker 1>technological innovations played a far </v>
<v Speaker 1>more important role in the emancipation </v>

212
00:11:57.221 --> 00:11:57.700
<v Speaker 1>of women.</v>

213
00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:58.533
<v Speaker 1>Then feminist political ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you can point to certain </v>

214
00:12:02.291 --> 00:12:04.750
<v Speaker 1>movements like the suffragette movement </v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

215
00:12:04.751 --> 00:12:07.360
<v Speaker 1>that pushed hard to have the vote </v>
<v Speaker 1>extended to women,</v>

216
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.673
<v Speaker 1>but even that I would say it was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of deeper transformations </v>

217
00:12:12.791 --> 00:12:13.624
<v Speaker 1>at a cultural and technological level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the people who are pushing the </v>

218
00:12:17.351 --> 00:12:18.184
<v Speaker 1>idea that it was the feminist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was feminist political machinations </v>

219
00:12:21.731 --> 00:12:22.564
<v Speaker 1>that produced the equalization of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation between men and women are </v>

220
00:12:25.451 --> 00:12:28.780
<v Speaker 1>mostly diehard ideological feminists who</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to think that way,</v>

221
00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:29.614
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't look to me like that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>valid historical interpretation in the </v>

222
00:12:32.651 --> 00:12:34.240
<v Speaker 1>least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to move on now.</v>

223
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:38.330
<v Speaker 1>I would like talk like to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>truthfulness in chapter eight on rule.</v>

224
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.930
<v Speaker 1>If you write about the law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lifeline,</v>

225
00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:42.693
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say someone living in lifeline is </v>

226
00:12:44.651 --> 00:12:45.484
<v Speaker 1>attempting to manipulate reality with </v>
<v Speaker 1>perception based on what you write into </v>

227
00:12:49.331 --> 00:12:50.164
<v Speaker 1>the chapter.</v>

228
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:51.803
<v Speaker 1>Want to say that a large part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population in 21st century live a life </v>

229
00:12:57.461 --> 00:12:58.294
<v Speaker 1>flight because they avoid conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say what they think pleases to </v>

230
00:13:00.811 --> 00:13:03.910
<v Speaker 1>their spouses or their bosses instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling the truth.</v>

231
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.983
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do what is convenient at every </v>

232
00:13:06.761 --> 00:13:09.160
<v Speaker 1>given moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of saying what they really want.</v>

233
00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well perhaps not at every given moment,</v>

234
00:13:11.261 --> 00:13:13.750
<v Speaker 1>but they certainly fall prey to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>temptation.</v>

235
00:13:13.751 --> 00:13:15.250
<v Speaker 1>It's conflict avoidance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

236
00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a psychologist,</v>

237
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.960
<v Speaker 1>psychologists deal with a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

238
00:13:19.961 --> 00:13:20.794
<v Speaker 1>but I would say the two most common </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal problems are anxiety and </v>

239
00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:25.804
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be one class and the other </v>

240
00:13:27.641 --> 00:13:31.750
<v Speaker 1>would be lack of assertiveness and lack </v>
<v Speaker 1>of assertiveness.</v>

241
00:13:31.751 --> 00:13:35.170
<v Speaker 1>Subsumes the the problems that you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>described.</v>

242
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:36.543
<v Speaker 1>People won't stand up for themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>say what they need and want and then </v>

243
00:13:39.911 --> 00:13:43.810
<v Speaker 1>they don't negotiate properly and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might and they're avoiding.</v>

244
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.640
<v Speaker 1>They're avoiding conflict in the short </v>
<v Speaker 1>term,</v>

245
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:46.503
<v Speaker 1>which is a form of lie by omission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what that means is that problems </v>

246
00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.860
<v Speaker 1>aggregate around them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's often why people end up divorced.</v>

247
00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will stay married for a long time</v>

248
00:13:56.861 --> 00:13:59.500
<v Speaker 1>and one partner will say to the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually,</v>

249
00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:02.350
<v Speaker 1>we'll I've been unhappy for the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight years.</v>

250
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:03.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

251
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:07.690
<v Speaker 1>that might have been something to </v>
<v Speaker 1>announce in increments,</v>

252
00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.273
<v Speaker 1>say weekly or even daily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long before everything accrued to the </v>

253
00:14:13.031 --> 00:14:16.690
<v Speaker 1>point where the only possible solution </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a catastrophic disillusion.</v>

254
00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.560
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of conflict involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>setting a relationship straight.</v>

255
00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.740
<v Speaker 1>You have to let each other know who you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are and because you're different,</v>

256
00:14:23.741 --> 00:14:27.400
<v Speaker 1>that's going to cause conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to conflict about whose job</v>

257
00:14:27.401 --> 00:14:29.950
<v Speaker 1>takes priority and when you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see conflict,</v>

258
00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.440
<v Speaker 1>have conflict about how to spend your </v>
<v Speaker 1>free time,</v>

259
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:36.220
<v Speaker 1>but how to raise your children about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to manage the domestic economy,</v>

260
00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:40.120
<v Speaker 1>about what disciplinary strategies you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should use about where to vacation,</v>

261
00:14:40.121 --> 00:14:41.080
<v Speaker 1>about what to eat.</v>

262
00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:45.040
<v Speaker 1>Like all of those things have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiated through.</v>

263
00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:49.670
<v Speaker 1>And all of that requires truthfulness so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that each of you know what the other is,</v>

264
00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.840
<v Speaker 1>wants and will be with and conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

265
00:14:53.841 --> 00:14:55.190
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

266
00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:56.893
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing more exhausting than </v>

267
00:14:58.671 --> 00:14:59.504
<v Speaker 1>telling the truth and negotiating with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your spouse is not doing it and waiting </v>

268
00:15:03.141 --> 00:15:06.260
<v Speaker 1>for the divorce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both of them are difficult,</v>

269
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:08.260
<v Speaker 1>but I would recommend the former.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

270
00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:12.740
<v Speaker 1>If we talk about the workplace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want to say to those viewers</v>

271
00:15:12.741 --> 00:15:14.810
<v Speaker 1>that the regularly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

272
00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:17.330
<v Speaker 1>agree with her bosses instead of telling</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth,</v>

273
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:19.730
<v Speaker 1>what am I doing to themselves in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>long run?</v>

274
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:21.043
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're taking the soul out of their </v>

275
00:15:22.011 --> 00:15:23.360
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

276
00:15:23.361 --> 00:15:24.860
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

277
00:15:24.861 --> 00:15:25.694
<v Speaker 1>just imagine for the sake of argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you encounter one annoying thing a </v>

278
00:15:30.111 --> 00:15:30.944
<v Speaker 1>day at work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>small annoying thing and then let's say </v>

279
00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:34.753
<v Speaker 1>for the sake of argument that you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a little battle about that and </v>

280
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.140
<v Speaker 1>improve it somewhat.</v>

281
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:40.873
<v Speaker 1>Or You could just say it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like probably doesn't matter today </v>

282
00:15:43.911 --> 00:15:44.744
<v Speaker 1>or it might not even matter tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you make a thousand decisions </v>

283
00:15:47.691 --> 00:15:49.790
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you will do over three years,</v>

284
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:50.953
<v Speaker 1>then now you have a thousand things </v>
<v Speaker 1>bugging you at work and if you wait for </v>

285
00:15:54.411 --> 00:15:55.244
<v Speaker 1>five years then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then it's 2000 things and the same </v>

286
00:15:57.861 --> 00:16:00.860
<v Speaker 1>thing happens with your kids and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing happens in your marriage.</v>

287
00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.860
<v Speaker 1>Those things accrue and they turn into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>monster,</v>

288
00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:07.520
<v Speaker 1>but you would agree the conflict </v>
<v Speaker 1>avoidance is practical.</v>

289
00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes people just go on with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

290
00:16:11.181 --> 00:16:13.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in a marriage for example,</v>

291
00:16:13.761 --> 00:16:16.130
<v Speaker 1>there's almost nothing so small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't fight about it,</v>

292
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:18.860
<v Speaker 1>but the question is what does flight </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean?</v>

293
00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:19.973
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if if you and I have a </v>

294
00:16:22.701 --> 00:16:24.830
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say it's a business partnership,</v>

295
00:16:24.831 --> 00:16:29.831
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really matter if we have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship and we have a difference of</v>

296
00:16:30.021 --> 00:16:32.270
<v Speaker 1>opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to battle it through,</v>

297
00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:33.373
<v Speaker 1>but the purpose of the battle isn't so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that your viewpoint prevails or that my </v>

298
00:16:36.261 --> 00:16:39.230
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint prevails because either of us </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be wrong.</v>

299
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:44.330
<v Speaker 1>The purpose is to engage in the conflict</v>
<v Speaker 1>jewel exchange of opinion so that we can</v>

300
00:16:44.331 --> 00:16:47.930
<v Speaker 1>see a joint path forward to peace and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

301
00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.600
<v Speaker 1>and that's the thing is like if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting with your wife,</v>

302
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:51.463
<v Speaker 1>the first thing to remember if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting with your wife is you have to </v>

303
00:16:53.841 --> 00:16:54.674
<v Speaker 1>live with her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe beating her in the argument is </v>

304
00:16:57.951 --> 00:17:01.490
<v Speaker 1>not the right outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the right outcome is is saying what</v>

305
00:17:01.491 --> 00:17:05.390
<v Speaker 1>you have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to what she has to say and see</v>

306
00:17:05.391 --> 00:17:06.224
<v Speaker 1>if you guys can come up with a mutually </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreed upon solution that will make the </v>

307
00:17:08.841 --> 00:17:09.674
<v Speaker 1>problem go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if we explored conversation between </v>

308
00:17:14.001 --> 00:17:15.600
<v Speaker 1>people in society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you.</v>

309
00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:16.883
<v Speaker 1>I'll also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these conversations are full of </v>

310
00:17:18.381 --> 00:17:19.214
<v Speaker 1>falsehoods and lies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are nice to people that dislike </v>

311
00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:24.950
<v Speaker 1>there are being fake because we try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be friendly.</v>

312
00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's.</v>

313
00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:31.340
<v Speaker 1>Is it morally wrong to live your life in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way?</v>

314
00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:32.173
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

315
00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:34.010
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

316
00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:34.873
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't avoid the necessary conflict </v>

317
00:17:39.591 --> 00:17:40.424
<v Speaker 1>of negotiation towards peace if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>avoided all that it means is that it </v>

318
00:17:44.181 --> 00:17:45.014
<v Speaker 1>accrues and multiplies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the oldest one of the oldest stories </v>

319
00:17:47.721 --> 00:17:48.980
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oldest stories,</v>

320
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:52.350
<v Speaker 1>we have point to that as part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prime moral doctrine.</v>

321
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:53.663
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

322
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:55.650
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a form of impulsivity.</v>

323
00:17:55.651 --> 00:17:56.484
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you only do what you want in the </v>

324
00:17:57.421 --> 00:18:02.250
<v Speaker 1>moment impulsively that there be </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of that into the future,</v>

325
00:18:02.251 --> 00:18:04.080
<v Speaker 1>which is why you shouldn't act </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulsively,</v>

326
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.830
<v Speaker 1>impulsively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Avoiding conflict is exactly the same.</v>

327
00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:09.390
<v Speaker 1>And people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same problem.</v>

328
00:18:09.391 --> 00:18:10.620
<v Speaker 1>People know this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know if,</v>

329
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:15.420
<v Speaker 1>if someone's casually rude to you in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a bus driver for example,</v>

330
00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.070
<v Speaker 1>and you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

331
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:19.103
<v Speaker 1>there's always the possibility that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll stew for hours over what you </v>

332
00:18:22.021 --> 00:18:22.854
<v Speaker 1>should have said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when someone transgressed </v>

333
00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.113
<v Speaker 1>against you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you have to say what you have </v>

334
00:18:30.631 --> 00:18:31.200
<v Speaker 1>to say.</v>

335
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.033
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to say it as if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>the totally correct authoritarians </v>

336
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.780
<v Speaker 1>tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can say it in the spirit of,</v>

337
00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:40.680
<v Speaker 1>of inquiry or inquiry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

338
00:18:40.681 --> 00:18:41.514
<v Speaker 1>because there's always the possibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're wrong and you want to </v>

339
00:18:43.771 --> 00:18:44.604
<v Speaker 1>listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is also why you want to listen to </v>

340
00:18:45.841 --> 00:18:47.270
<v Speaker 1>your partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

341
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:48.540
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your spouse.</v>

342
00:18:48.541 --> 00:18:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Even if what they're saying to you is </v>
<v Speaker 1>you find very annoying.</v>

343
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:55.770
<v Speaker 1>It's always possible that they're right </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you should listen because if they're</v>

344
00:18:55.771 --> 00:18:56.604
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they can stop you from heading for </v>

345
00:18:57.961 --> 00:18:59.010
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the future.</v>

346
00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:03.120
<v Speaker 1>I want to go backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk about rule number seven.</v>

347
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:04.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pursue.</v>

348
00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:06.920
<v Speaker 1>What is meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not was this expedient.</v>

349
00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:09.633
<v Speaker 1>You write in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no faith and no courage and no </v>

350
00:19:13.381 --> 00:19:18.240
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice and doing what is expedient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you say to those of you?</v>

351
00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:19.074
<v Speaker 1>Where's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't pursue their dreams are locked </v>

352
00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:22.283
<v Speaker 1>into their cadets because they are too </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid to take risks and pursue </v>

353
00:19:26.551 --> 00:19:27.330
<v Speaker 1>something meaningful.</v>

354
00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I would say is,</v>

355
00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.293
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be afraid of taking risks </v>

356
00:19:31.441 --> 00:19:35.790
<v Speaker 1>and pursuing something meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you should be more afraid of staying</v>

357
00:19:35.791 --> 00:19:37.680
<v Speaker 1>where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's making you miserable,</v>

358
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:38.823
<v Speaker 1>it's like the first thing you want to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>is dispensed with the idea that you get </v>

359
00:19:41.671 --> 00:19:42.504
<v Speaker 1>to have any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any permanent security outside of your </v>

360
00:19:45.841 --> 00:19:48.840
<v Speaker 1>ability to contend and adapt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same issue with children.</v>

361
00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're paying a price by </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting there being miserable.</v>

362
00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:53.523
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

363
00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:55.650
<v Speaker 1>the devil I know is better than the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

364
00:19:55.651 --> 00:19:57.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be so sure of that.</v>

365
00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:01.920
<v Speaker 1>The clock is ticking and if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>miserable in your job now and you change</v>

366
00:20:01.921 --> 00:20:02.754
<v Speaker 1>nothing in five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will be much more miserable and </v>

367
00:20:04.561 --> 00:20:08.010
<v Speaker 1>you'll be a lot older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this isn't the luxury to pursue what</v>

368
00:20:08.011 --> 00:20:10.140
<v Speaker 1>is meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our viewers have with,</v>

369
00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:13.290
<v Speaker 1>they have children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have payments in loans.</v>

370
00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:16.140
<v Speaker 1>It's a luxury to pursue because we lack </v>
<v Speaker 1>the resources.</v>

371
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>

372
00:20:17.011 --> 00:20:17.844
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about what makes you </v>

373
00:20:19.441 --> 00:20:20.274
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a luxury to pursue what makes you </v>

374
00:20:22.501 --> 00:20:23.334
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a moral obligation to pursue what </v>

375
00:20:25.561 --> 00:20:28.440
<v Speaker 1>you find meaningful and that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean it's easy.</v>

376
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:32.190
<v Speaker 1>It might require sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you need to change your job to,</v>

377
00:20:32.191 --> 00:20:36.180
<v Speaker 1>let's say you have a family and and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>children and a mortgage,</v>

378
00:20:36.181 --> 00:20:37.014
<v Speaker 1>you have responsibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've already picked up those </v>

379
00:20:39.541 --> 00:20:40.374
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't just get to walk away Scott </v>

380
00:20:42.421 --> 00:20:43.141
<v Speaker 1>free say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

381
00:20:43.141 --> 00:20:44.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't like my job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I quit.</v>

382
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:45.833
<v Speaker 1>That's no strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what you might have to do is you </v>

383
00:20:47.921 --> 00:20:48.251
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

384
00:20:48.251 --> 00:20:51.760
<v Speaker 1>this job is killing my soul or right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what do I have to do about that?</v>

385
00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:52.953
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to look for another job while no </v>

386
00:20:54.161 --> 00:20:55.570
<v Speaker 1>one wants to hire me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

387
00:20:55.571 --> 00:20:58.720
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you need to educate yourself more.</v>

388
00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you need to update your </v>
<v Speaker 1>curriculum,</v>

389
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:01.923
<v Speaker 1>veto your resume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you need to overcome your fear of </v>

390
00:21:04.571 --> 00:21:05.404
<v Speaker 1>being interviewed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you need to sharpen your social </v>

391
00:21:08.111 --> 00:21:08.944
<v Speaker 1>skills like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to think about these things </v>

392
00:21:10.661 --> 00:21:12.730
<v Speaker 1>strategically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to switch careers,</v>

393
00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:16.660
<v Speaker 1>you have to do it like an intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible person that might take you a</v>

394
00:21:16.661 --> 00:21:17.990
<v Speaker 1>couple of years of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

395
00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:19.093
<v Speaker 1>of effort to do properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say pursue something </v>

396
00:21:20.801 --> 00:21:22.750
<v Speaker 1>meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it important to have a vocation?</v>

397
00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:27.160
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more important to to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

398
00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:30.700
<v Speaker 1>an ethos and ethic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I have a program,</v>

399
00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:32.860
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the future authoring program,</v>

400
00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:33.723
<v Speaker 1>which isn't writing program that enables</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to develop a vision for their </v>

401
00:21:36.971 --> 00:21:41.020
<v Speaker 1>life and then to develop a strategy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's based on the idea.</v>

402
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:42.063
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that and it's an extension of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideas in the book or at least </v>

403
00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.390
<v Speaker 1>something along the same lines.</v>

404
00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.120
<v Speaker 1>The first thing that you want to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out.</v>

405
00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:52.420
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you were taking care of yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you were someone you cared for,</v>

406
00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:54.040
<v Speaker 1>which is rule number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

407
00:21:54.041 --> 00:21:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Essentially then you should figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

408
00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.350
<v Speaker 1>if you could have what you needed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted,</v>

409
00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:02.440
<v Speaker 1>what would it be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What sort of friends would you have?</v>

410
00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:04.750
<v Speaker 1>What would your family relationships </v>
<v Speaker 1>look like?</v>

411
00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.760
<v Speaker 1>How would you conduct yourself with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>children?</v>

412
00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:10.960
<v Speaker 1>How would you educate yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to think through how it is that</v>

413
00:22:10.961 --> 00:22:11.794
<v Speaker 1>your life could be properly arranged if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you had that ability and then you can </v>

414
00:22:16.691 --> 00:22:20.110
<v Speaker 1>name it that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the funny thing is is that if you do</v>

415
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:23.800
<v Speaker 1>pause it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a goal of that sort and work towards it,</v>

416
00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.113
<v Speaker 1>you will move towards it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The goal will change because you'll </v>

417
00:22:26.951 --> 00:22:29.230
<v Speaker 1>learn things along the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean I've.</v>

418
00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:30.123
<v Speaker 1>I've dealt with hundreds of people in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical and consulting practice and we </v>

419
00:22:33.551 --> 00:22:34.930
<v Speaker 1>set a goal.</v>

420
00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:35.763
<v Speaker 1>We develop a vision and work towards it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it things inevitably get better for </v>

421
00:22:40.721 --> 00:22:43.090
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a luxury.</v>

422
00:22:43.091 --> 00:22:44.170
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult.</v>

423
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.750
<v Speaker 1>It's a moral responsibility and it isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>

424
00:22:46.751 --> 00:22:47.471
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

425
00:22:47.471 --> 00:22:48.304
<v Speaker 1>The pursuit isn't for happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a moral responsibility to push you </v>

426
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:52.320
<v Speaker 1>what is meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

427
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:54.460
<v Speaker 1>I would like to end the interview with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

428
00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:58.510
<v Speaker 1>with site and criticism from your front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

429
00:22:58.511 --> 00:22:59.900
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Bernard shift.</v>

430
00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:01.940
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your friends many years.</v>

431
00:23:01.941 --> 00:23:03.700
<v Speaker 1>Some former colleagues at the University</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Toronto.</v>

432
00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.713
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote an article about you in the </v>

433
00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:08.020
<v Speaker 1>Toronto Star recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

434
00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:08.943
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was quite hard criticism on what do </v>

435
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:13.840
<v Speaker 1>you have been doing in the last few </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and he wrote,</v>

436
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:14.733
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan is fighting to maintain the </v>
<v Speaker 1>status quo to keep cares bay or so he </v>

437
00:23:17.591 --> 00:23:20.080
<v Speaker 1>believes he is not a free speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>warrior.</v>

438
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:23.260
<v Speaker 1>He is a social author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>warriors are,</v>

439
00:23:23.261 --> 00:23:24.094
<v Speaker 1>you were social author warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that people can decide that for </v>

440
00:23:27.101 --> 00:23:27.934
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

441
00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:31.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that Bernie criticized</v>

442
00:23:31.481 --> 00:23:34.540
<v Speaker 1>was my lecturing style at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>

443
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.943
<v Speaker 1>Now all those lectures are online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the essentially like a </v>

444
00:23:40.511 --> 00:23:41.344
<v Speaker 1>representative sample of my lectures </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the last 30 years are online and I </v>

445
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:48.560
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a few fragments and hundreds of</v>

446
00:23:48.561 --> 00:23:49.394
<v Speaker 1>thousands of people have watched them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the criticisms that Bernie leveled </v>

447
00:23:53.001 --> 00:23:56.000
<v Speaker 1>at me have not been leveled at me by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>watchers.</v>

448
00:23:56.001 --> 00:23:59.840
<v Speaker 1>And so people can go watch the lectures </v>
<v Speaker 1>and make up their own mind about that,</v>

449
00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:02.290
<v Speaker 1>but he also crashed into her motives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

450
00:24:02.291 --> 00:24:03.124
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wants to know what your endgame is </v>

451
00:24:04.011 --> 00:24:04.761
<v Speaker 1>all about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

452
00:24:04.761 --> 00:24:05.594
<v Speaker 1>what is your primary motive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My primary motive as a clinical </v>

453
00:24:08.781 --> 00:24:09.614
<v Speaker 1>psychologist and educator is to help </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals live more meaningful and </v>

454
00:24:13.551 --> 00:24:17.150
<v Speaker 1>productive lives in harmony with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>families and their community.</v>

455
00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:21.320
<v Speaker 1>That's my motive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the evidence for that I think is.</v>

456
00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:23.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people go online,</v>

457
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:24.223
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could watch the lectures and decide </v>

458
00:24:25.341 --> 00:24:26.900
<v Speaker 1>for yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can also go,</v>

459
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.153
<v Speaker 1>there's a suspect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably maybe 250,000 people have </v>

460
00:24:32.871 --> 00:24:35.750
<v Speaker 1>commented on the lectures and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>effects on them.</v>

461
00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:40.070
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what people say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching the lectures.</v>

462
00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to develop a vision for my </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

463
00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to become more responsible </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's really helping.</v>

464
00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:48.920
<v Speaker 1>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I hear all the time when</v>

465
00:24:48.921 --> 00:24:51.620
<v Speaker 1>I do these public lectures like which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which aren't political,</v>

466
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:54.380
<v Speaker 1>but when we gain success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really raised the bar,</v>

467
00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.260
<v Speaker 1>we set our ambitions higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

468
00:24:57.261 --> 00:24:58.820
<v Speaker 1>what is your end game?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want?</v>

469
00:24:58.821 --> 00:25:00.410
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want.</v>

470
00:25:00.411 --> 00:25:01.244
<v Speaker 1>I want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to help as many individuals as </v>

471
00:25:04.401 --> 00:25:08.720
<v Speaker 1>possible become more courageous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more truthful,</v>

472
00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:13.220
<v Speaker 1>and more engaged in the pursuit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>

473
00:25:13.221 --> 00:25:16.520
<v Speaker 1>familial and social harmony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want.</v>

474
00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:21.080
<v Speaker 1>You're pursuing what is meaningful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pursuing.</v>

475
00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:24.230
<v Speaker 1>I believe that to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly meaningful to me.</v>

476
00:25:24.231 --> 00:25:27.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there isn't everywhere I go now,</v>

477
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:31.880
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter where I land in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>airport or if I walked down the street,</v>

478
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.823
<v Speaker 1>three or four people will come up to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll tell me I was in a dark </v>

479
00:25:37.491 --> 00:25:38.750
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was anxious,</v>

480
00:25:38.751 --> 00:25:39.950
<v Speaker 1>depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic,</v>

481
00:25:39.951 --> 00:25:40.641
<v Speaker 1>drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>addicted,</v>

482
00:25:40.641 --> 00:25:42.560
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>homeless in jail.</v>

483
00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:46.100
<v Speaker 1>You name it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bad relationship with my girlfriend,</v>

484
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:47.203
<v Speaker 1>bad relationship with my parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been watching your lectures or </v>

485
00:25:49.821 --> 00:25:50.654
<v Speaker 1>reading your book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to tell the truth and </v>

486
00:25:52.371 --> 00:25:56.510
<v Speaker 1>get my life together and everything is </v>
<v Speaker 1>way better and so then you think,</v>

487
00:25:56.511 --> 00:25:57.344
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could have what you wanted and </v>

488
00:25:58.731 --> 00:26:01.700
<v Speaker 1>what would be meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you imagine you could go anywhere in the</v>

489
00:26:01.701 --> 00:26:02.534
<v Speaker 1>world and people would come up to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're strangers and tell you that </v>

490
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:08.000
<v Speaker 1>that's as good as it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about politics?</v>

491
00:26:08.001 --> 00:26:09.740
<v Speaker 1>Do you have political ambitions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

492
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:11.790
<v Speaker 1>No political ambitions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

493
00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:12.653
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have ambitions to speak with people </v>

494
00:26:14.211 --> 00:26:17.150
<v Speaker 1>who are politically motivated if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to speak with me,</v>

495
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:22.430
<v Speaker 1>but personally I've already decided that</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm doing at the moment is more,</v>

496
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:23.923
<v Speaker 1>and I thought this my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've made this choice multiple times in </v>

497
00:26:25.701 --> 00:26:28.460
<v Speaker 1>my life that this approach is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>suitable for me.</v>

498
00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:30.080
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ms Dot Peterson.</v>

499
00:26:30.081 --> 00:26:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for your time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much for the interview.</v>
