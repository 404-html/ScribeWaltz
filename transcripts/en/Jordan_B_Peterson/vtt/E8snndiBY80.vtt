1
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.903
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

2
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.890
<v Speaker 2>you should have read by now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that little book that,</v>

3
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's it called?</v>

4
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.000
<v Speaker 2>Thought emotion and memory should have </v>
<v Speaker 2>read the three or so papers in here.</v>

5
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:37.650
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's four of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Four and also the first,</v>

6
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.080
<v Speaker 2>well the chapters in this book up to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>end of the neuropsychology section,</v>

7
00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:48.030
<v Speaker 2>which is basically to page 80.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what we've covered today.</v>

8
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.133
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

9
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.410
<v Speaker 2>I showed you a simpler diagram of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>sword last week and that's</v>

10
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.283
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

11
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.300
<v Speaker 2>The model of the known normal loud </v>
<v Speaker 2>amputation.</v>

12
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.060
<v Speaker 2>Let me show you a little cartoon here </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I think is kind of funny.</v>

13
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.573
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as far as I can tell that's a decent </v>

14
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.510
<v Speaker 2>but simplistic model of what it is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

15
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.740
<v Speaker 2>when you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

16
00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:29.574
<v Speaker 2>something with regards to its </v>
<v Speaker 2>implications for behavior or its </v>

17
00:01:33.091 --> 00:01:34.080
<v Speaker 2>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because remember,</v>

18
00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:34.914
<v Speaker 2>that's what we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we're trying to specify in </v>

19
00:01:36.121 --> 00:01:36.871
<v Speaker 2>this class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

20
00:01:36.871 --> 00:01:37.704
<v Speaker 2>The initial introductory discussions </v>
<v Speaker 2>hinged on the notion that when we map </v>

21
00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:45.540
<v Speaker 2>our environments as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>active exploration,</v>

22
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.620
<v Speaker 2>we mapped them for two reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to specify the sensory nature of</v>

23
00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:51.990
<v Speaker 2>the things that we encounter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we also,</v>

24
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.210
<v Speaker 2>more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more fundamentally,</v>

25
00:01:54.211 --> 00:01:56.220
<v Speaker 2>perhaps not more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more fundamentally,</v>

26
00:01:56.221 --> 00:01:59.430
<v Speaker 2>we really want to keep track of where </v>
<v Speaker 2>the meanings reside.</v>

27
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.260
<v Speaker 2>Now this is coopera coded by something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we'll discuss to some degree today,</v>

28
00:02:04.261 --> 00:02:07.860
<v Speaker 2>which is that things aren't simply given</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the environment.</v>

29
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the case with sensory things even</v>

30
00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:13.050
<v Speaker 2>although there's a lot of dispute about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

31
00:02:13.051 --> 00:02:15.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was coons fundamental point </v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as I can tell him.</v>

32
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.160
<v Speaker 2>His book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sign,</v>

33
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.143
<v Speaker 2>the structure of scientific revolutions </v>
<v Speaker 2>in that what constitutes the object of </v>

34
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.480
<v Speaker 2>objects seems to shift as we shift our </v>
<v Speaker 2>techniques of exploration,</v>

35
00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:29.920
<v Speaker 2>which is why we have new scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>theories.</v>

36
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.773
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>theoretically there's something at the </v>

37
00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:36.350
<v Speaker 2>bottom of it all towards which were</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards,</v>

38
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.180
<v Speaker 2>which are ideas are approximating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>

39
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.360
<v Speaker 2>it's a difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a difficult idea,</v>

40
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.123
<v Speaker 2>but it's much more clear in the case of </v>
<v Speaker 2>our maps of meaning because how you </v>

41
00:02:49.141 --> 00:02:52.170
<v Speaker 2>approach something really does determine</v>
<v Speaker 2>in large part,</v>

42
00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:53.850
<v Speaker 2>it's an effective significance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

43
00:02:53.851 --> 00:02:57.180
<v Speaker 2>We can all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can all see this fire for animals is</v>

44
00:02:57.181 --> 00:02:59.440
<v Speaker 2>dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pure and simple,</v>

45
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 2>but fire for people is liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has been liberating.</v>

46
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:03.784
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the most sort of the most </v>

47
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:07.480
<v Speaker 2>dramatic example I can think of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

48
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:08.643
<v Speaker 2>You switched the motivational category </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the object by altering your approach </v>

49
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:14.230
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's dangerous if you let it burn you.</v>

50
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.363
<v Speaker 2>If you control it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it cooks your food and it heats </v>

51
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 2>your cae and et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

52
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:20.740
<v Speaker 2>and it's something I'll buy an </v>
<v Speaker 2>alteration in your action.</v>

53
00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:23.230
<v Speaker 2>You've completely transformed the nature</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the object,</v>

54
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.183
<v Speaker 2>at least with regards to its utility and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a big part of what we consider </v>

55
00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:29.104
<v Speaker 2>creativity.</v>

56
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.943
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I've been trying to </v>

57
00:03:32.611 --> 00:03:33.444
<v Speaker 2>figure out is what's this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the structure of our knowledge </v>

58
00:03:36.601 --> 00:03:38.430
<v Speaker 2>when we say that we know something and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's this,</v>

59
00:03:38.431 --> 00:03:39.264
<v Speaker 2>the gnome and it's a bounded domain </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically that's characterized by </v>

60
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:44.693
<v Speaker 2>specification of the emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>significance of what's going on in the </v>

61
00:03:47.401 --> 00:03:48.234
<v Speaker 2>present,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least as far as that's interpreted </v>

62
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.933
<v Speaker 2>and specification of what we would like </v>
<v Speaker 2>to happen in the future and then the </v>

63
00:03:54.271 --> 00:03:57.300
<v Speaker 2>construction of motor plans to turn one </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the other.</v>

64
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.060
<v Speaker 2>Now I've appended or updated this </v>
<v Speaker 2>diagram,</v>

65
00:04:00.061 --> 00:04:03.300
<v Speaker 2>someone from its original simpler form </v>
<v Speaker 2>to show that,</v>

66
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.223
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were attempting to transform this </v>

67
00:04:06.781 --> 00:04:10.260
<v Speaker 2>into this things that you don't expect </v>
<v Speaker 2>might happen,</v>

68
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.333
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's pretty obvious if you think </v>

69
00:04:12.481 --> 00:04:13.314
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because fun expect that things didn't </v>

70
00:04:14.581 --> 00:04:16.260
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would mean that you knew everything</v>

71
00:04:16.261 --> 00:04:17.094
<v Speaker 2>and you don't know everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that means it unexpected things are </v>

72
00:04:19.201 --> 00:04:20.034
<v Speaker 2>always happening</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're undertaking a behavior that's </v>

73
00:04:23.941 --> 00:04:27.480
<v Speaker 2>designed to meet a certain end and </v>
<v Speaker 2>something unexpected happens.</v>

74
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hmm.</v>

75
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:31.743
<v Speaker 2>That activates a chain of phenomena</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I described later that we're going </v>

76
00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:38.020
<v Speaker 2>to discuss today as the orienting </v>
<v Speaker 2>reflects.</v>

77
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:38.854
<v Speaker 2>But basically the bottom line is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything unexpected is the UN in and of </v>

78
00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:46.120
<v Speaker 2>itself intrinsically meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really,</v>

79
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.440
<v Speaker 2>really important.</v>

80
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.273
<v Speaker 3>MMM.</v>

81
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:51.613
<v Speaker 2>We don't assign meaning to things so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much as we do restrict the meaning that </v>

82
00:04:57.111 --> 00:05:00.290
<v Speaker 2>they already offer us to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a specified domain.</v>

83
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.863
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

84
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.310
<v Speaker 2>if you think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of reverses has a,</v>

85
00:05:10.311 --> 00:05:11.144
<v Speaker 2>as I've mentioned before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that reverses many normal psychological </v>

86
00:05:13.701 --> 00:05:15.530
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that we have to,</v>

87
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.840
<v Speaker 2>that things are neutral until we </v>
<v Speaker 2>discover it useful to them.</v>

88
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:21.283
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

89
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.553
<v Speaker 2>So I told you this story or you read the</v>
<v Speaker 2>story perhaps about the guy who's </v>

90
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:28.543
<v Speaker 2>thinking about his performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At some meeting he's thinking about how </v>

91
00:05:32.931 --> 00:05:35.450
<v Speaker 2>well he's going to do and how he's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to dominate the meeting and so on.</v>

92
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.830
<v Speaker 2>He runs and he runs into a number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>obstacles on his way to the meeting,</v>

93
00:05:39.831 --> 00:05:42.710
<v Speaker 2>including an elevator that won't </v>
<v Speaker 2>function and people who get in his way.</v>

94
00:05:42.711 --> 00:05:43.544
<v Speaker 2>And the reason I told the story in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>book is to just to show you how this </v>

95
00:05:47.061 --> 00:05:48.740
<v Speaker 2>sort of thing operates in day to day </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

96
00:05:48.741 --> 00:05:49.574
<v Speaker 2>It's a pretty boring story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean nothing particularly exciting </v>

97
00:05:52.101 --> 00:05:54.560
<v Speaker 2>happens I suppose until the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing exciting.</v>

98
00:05:54.561 --> 00:05:59.120
<v Speaker 2>Happens means only unexpected things </v>
<v Speaker 2>occur,</v>

99
00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.983
<v Speaker 2>nothing exciting happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meaning means no emotion is released in </v>

100
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:03.494
<v Speaker 2>the course of the story until the end </v>
<v Speaker 2>because all of the things that are </v>

101
00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:06.464
<v Speaker 2>unexpected are trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unexpected things that all occur at the </v>

102
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.700
<v Speaker 2>level of of minor lea plan.</v>

103
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.700
<v Speaker 2>So my guy is upset by the fact that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>elevator doesn't come,</v>

104
00:06:18.981 --> 00:06:19.814
<v Speaker 2>but that's not such a catastrophe </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he can always take the stairs </v>

105
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:23.623
<v Speaker 2>and if someone's</v>
<v Speaker 2>ahead of you on the sidewalk and you're </v>

106
00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:29.330
<v Speaker 2>in a hurry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while you can always go around them.</v>

107
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.373
<v Speaker 2>These are pretty minor deviations and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're interesting and they do inspire </v>

108
00:06:33.081 --> 00:06:33.914
<v Speaker 2>a certain amount of emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But all they mean is that you have to </v>

109
00:06:36.591 --> 00:06:40.640
<v Speaker 2>shift from one sub goal to another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then at the end of the story,</v>

110
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.793
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>events of a different magnitude to </v>

111
00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:48.230
<v Speaker 2>occur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea there is that,</v>

112
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:50.563
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the protagonist of this story that's </v>

113
00:06:52.041 --> 00:06:52.874
<v Speaker 2>outlined in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's expecting a commendation for his </v>

114
00:06:58.431 --> 00:07:01.370
<v Speaker 2>performance in the recent meeting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead he gets fired.</v>

115
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.800
<v Speaker 2>And in a sense you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

116
00:07:03.801 --> 00:07:04.634
<v Speaker 2>all hell breaks loose as a consequence </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that because that information which </v>

117
00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:10.700
<v Speaker 2>can be easily denied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blows his whole world.</v>

118
00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.730
<v Speaker 2>It isn't something as simple as an event</v>
<v Speaker 2>that interferes with a particular plan,</v>

119
00:07:16.731 --> 00:07:17.564
<v Speaker 2>a sequence of behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something that demonstrates </v>

120
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:20.773
<v Speaker 2>incontrovertibly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this whole notion of the ideal </v>

121
00:07:23.301 --> 00:07:27.470
<v Speaker 2>future is impaired in some nontrivial </v>
<v Speaker 2>manner.</v>

122
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:28.483
<v Speaker 2>And that his viewpoint of himself in </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship to the world is </v>

123
00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:33.740
<v Speaker 2>dramatically and drastically flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

124
00:07:33.741 --> 00:07:34.574
<v Speaker 2>the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't need to know a lot of the </v>

125
00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:39.530
<v Speaker 2>things that we've been talking about to </v>
<v Speaker 2>start to make sense out of this thing.</v>

126
00:07:39.531 --> 00:07:40.364
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you get fired from a job that's </v>

127
00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:45.320
<v Speaker 2>a catastrophe or something ochres to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make you a really quick question,</v>

128
00:07:45.321 --> 00:07:47.660
<v Speaker 2>your own abilities or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or where you're going or,</v>

129
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:48.763
<v Speaker 2>or where you've come from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people find that very emotionally </v>

130
00:07:50.901 --> 00:07:52.890
<v Speaker 2>disruptive and well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

131
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.380
<v Speaker 2>the answer to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

132
00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:55.214
<v Speaker 2>what does it mean by the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people find that emotionally disruptive </v>

133
00:07:58.041 --> 00:07:58.874
<v Speaker 2>is to say that well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that aren't predictable have </v>

134
00:08:01.491 --> 00:08:06.491
<v Speaker 2>their own effect of valence and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>render things predictable using a Schema</v>

135
00:08:07.161 --> 00:08:07.994
<v Speaker 2>of this sort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if something comes along to blow </v>

136
00:08:10.041 --> 00:08:10.874
<v Speaker 2>your Schema,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then all those things that you've </v>

137
00:08:12.231 --> 00:08:13.064
<v Speaker 2>rendered predictable with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 2>your current patterns of behavior are </v>

138
00:08:15.711 --> 00:08:18.140
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they're unpredictable,</v>

139
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.020
<v Speaker 2>most particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're frightening.</v>

140
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.370
<v Speaker 2>That's the first thing that comes up.</v>

141
00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:27.880
<v Speaker 4>His reaction to the elevator and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>traffic.</v>

142
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:29.953
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

143
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:34.830
<v Speaker 4>The</v>
<v Speaker 4>distinction between,</v>

144
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:36.210
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

145
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:38.060
<v Speaker 4>losing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

146
00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.173
<v Speaker 4>not the scenario now working anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like losing confidence in this scenario </v>

147
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.530
<v Speaker 4>and losing confidence in himself as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>scenario maker.</v>

148
00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:47.960
<v Speaker 4>I mean there seems to be</v>

149
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.501
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

150
00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:49.281
<v Speaker 2>the perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect.</v>

151
00:08:49.281 --> 00:08:50.770
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's perfectly reasonable be,</v>

152
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.780
<v Speaker 2>is that a useful way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I was trying to go yes.</v>

153
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.700
<v Speaker 2>Rotated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just think it really different.</v>

154
00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:56.971
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

155
00:08:56.971 --> 00:08:58.740
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a perfectly reasonable,</v>

156
00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a perfectly reasonable comment.</v>

157
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.850
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing,</v>

158
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.010
<v Speaker 2>think about Tom Punishments.</v>

159
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.110
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that punishments produce pain,</v>

160
00:09:08.111 --> 00:09:09.580
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they produce hurt.</v>

161
00:09:09.581 --> 00:09:10.990
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the effect of state,</v>

162
00:09:10.991 --> 00:09:13.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean formal punishments and we'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>define what they are later.</v>

163
00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing about people though is that we</v>

164
00:09:16.421 --> 00:09:17.254
<v Speaker 2>can generalize and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in animals you can punish out </v>

165
00:09:19.781 --> 00:09:22.870
<v Speaker 2>particular patterns of action and human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>

166
00:09:22.871 --> 00:09:23.704
<v Speaker 2>You can punish out hierarchies of action</v>
<v Speaker 2>right down to the level of the action </v>

167
00:09:28.601 --> 00:09:31.600
<v Speaker 2>that generates action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's basically what are the action</v>

168
00:09:31.601 --> 00:09:34.060
<v Speaker 2>that generates patterns of action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what you're talking about.</v>

169
00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:38.440
<v Speaker 2>See if you really punish someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they lose faith in their ability to</v>

170
00:09:38.441 --> 00:09:39.181
<v Speaker 2>adapt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And well,</v>

171
00:09:39.181 --> 00:09:41.110
<v Speaker 2>when that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while you're depressed,</v>

172
00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:42.400
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not just depressed,</v>

173
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:43.660
<v Speaker 2>be depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't,</v>

174
00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.690
<v Speaker 2>you're not just hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depressed doesn't just mean you're hurt.</v>

175
00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.020
<v Speaker 2>Depressed means while you're in pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is literal by the way,</v>

176
00:09:50.021 --> 00:09:50.621
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

177
00:09:50.621 --> 00:09:51.850
<v Speaker 2>It's not metaphorical.</v>

178
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.740
<v Speaker 2>About 70% of people who are chronically </v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed have chronic pain syndrome,</v>

179
00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:58.660
<v Speaker 2>low back pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>migraine,</v>

180
00:09:58.661 --> 00:09:59.494
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The two things look very closely </v>

181
00:10:00.881 --> 00:10:01.714
<v Speaker 2>related.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Phenomenologically you also lose all </v>

182
00:10:03.671 --> 00:10:06.250
<v Speaker 2>hope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what does that mean when all,</v>

183
00:10:06.251 --> 00:10:07.630
<v Speaker 2>we're going to talk about that a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>later,</v>

184
00:10:07.631 --> 00:10:09.490
<v Speaker 2>but these aren't metaphors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

185
00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:13.270
<v Speaker 2>whenever you put in this box is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consumer Tory reward.</v>

186
00:10:13.271 --> 00:10:17.170
<v Speaker 2>It's a satisfaction by definition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what I want to talk about this a</v>

187
00:10:17.171 --> 00:10:18.640
<v Speaker 2>little bit more than the neuro psych </v>
<v Speaker 2>section.</v>

188
00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:20.163
<v Speaker 2>We know about satisfaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's four classes of </v>

189
00:10:22.331 --> 00:10:23.164
<v Speaker 2>motivationally relevant phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's punishments and there's </v>

190
00:10:26.921 --> 00:10:27.754
<v Speaker 2>satisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are primary positive and negative </v>

191
00:10:31.061 --> 00:10:34.030
<v Speaker 2>reinforcers in somewhat archaic </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavioral language,</v>

192
00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:37.780
<v Speaker 2>punishments and satisfactions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's cues of punishments,</v>

193
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:41.530
<v Speaker 2>accused of satisfactions and cues of </v>
<v Speaker 2>satisfaction give you hope,</v>

194
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:46.020
<v Speaker 2>but they're always conceived of in </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship to some goal.</v>

195
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:47.730
<v Speaker 2>You lose the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

196
00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:49.080
<v Speaker 2>you lose hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>

197
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:54.000
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what happens literally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if your goal has come tumbling down,</v>

198
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.983
<v Speaker 2>and the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other thing you have to realize is </v>

199
00:10:56.341 --> 00:10:57.174
<v Speaker 2>that your goal is always conceived of in</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship to your conceptualization </v>

200
00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:00.624
<v Speaker 2>of yourself because you always view </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility in relationship to what you </v>

201
00:11:04.351 --> 00:11:06.900
<v Speaker 2>think you can accomplish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these two things can't.</v>

202
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:08.850
<v Speaker 2>That's why this is a system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

203
00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.240
<v Speaker 2>this cannot be conceived up except in </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship to this.</v>

204
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:13.223
<v Speaker 2>And vice versa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You always construe where you're going </v>

205
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:17.243
<v Speaker 2>with regards to your conceptualization </v>
<v Speaker 2>of your current level of abilities and </v>

206
00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:20.844
<v Speaker 2>possibilities and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you evaluate the utility and </v>

207
00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:24.684
<v Speaker 2>desirability of what you have currently </v>
<v Speaker 2>in relationship to the best that could </v>

208
00:11:28.051 --> 00:11:30.570
<v Speaker 2>possibly be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a system,</v>

209
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.520
<v Speaker 2>it's a system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the known.</v>

210
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.740
<v Speaker 2>As long as you're operating in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>territory,</v>

211
00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:38.100
<v Speaker 2>you're aware exploration has already </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken place fundamentally.</v>

212
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.130
<v Speaker 2>So you're protected by your culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of looking at it.</v>

213
00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.490
<v Speaker 2>You're protected by your particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>story anyways.</v>

214
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:46.543
<v Speaker 2>That's assuming nothing really </v>
<v Speaker 2>dramatically unpredictable is going </v>

215
00:11:48.521 --> 00:11:51.100
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you referred to a scenario,</v>

216
00:11:51.101 --> 00:11:51.934
<v Speaker 2>so it would be right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would it be right to say that whole </v>

217
00:11:54.101 --> 00:11:57.970
<v Speaker 2>thing is a scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a story is absolute.</v>

218
00:11:57.971 --> 00:12:01.550
<v Speaker 2>That if that's something that that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a representation of it,</v>

219
00:12:01.551 --> 00:12:03.490
<v Speaker 2>then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's abstract.</v>

220
00:12:03.491 --> 00:12:06.790
<v Speaker 2>So in that sense we are a scenario </v>
<v Speaker 2>makers we made.</v>

221
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:07.983
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

222
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.823
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is the thing that's </v>

223
00:12:09.221 --> 00:12:10.054
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the things that's </v>

224
00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:11.854
<v Speaker 2>interesting about that is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>scenario from a mythological </v>

225
00:12:14.561 --> 00:12:16.120
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the world.</v>

226
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:17.703
<v Speaker 2>That's how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like myth from the mythological </v>

227
00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:20.614
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is concerned with meaning and not </v>

228
00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.730
<v Speaker 2>with sensory qualities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world is what you know,</v>

229
00:12:24.731 --> 00:12:25.564
<v Speaker 2>what you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the mediating process between the </v>

230
00:12:27.791 --> 00:12:29.530
<v Speaker 2>two and the mediating process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

231
00:12:29.531 --> 00:12:30.364
<v Speaker 2>is what you were referring to because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mediating process is the thing that </v>

232
00:12:32.471 --> 00:12:33.304
<v Speaker 2>creates order out of chaos or upon </v>
<v Speaker 2>occasion that turns chaos and door or </v>

233
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.220
<v Speaker 2>order into chaos as well.</v>

234
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:41.440
<v Speaker 2>It's the transformative process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>

235
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.170
<v Speaker 2>If you lose faith in that transformative</v>
<v Speaker 2>process,</v>

236
00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:45.700
<v Speaker 2>that's the end of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally.</v>

237
00:12:45.701 --> 00:12:48.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean life comes to a halt and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

238
00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:50.680
<v Speaker 2>well as we'll find out many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

239
00:12:50.681 --> 00:12:51.514
<v Speaker 2>many religious systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not all religious systems attempt to </v>

240
00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:54.874
<v Speaker 2>catalyze identification with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformative process as their aid to </v>

241
00:12:58.691 --> 00:13:00.400
<v Speaker 2>the good life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>

242
00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:02.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

243
00:13:02.411 --> 00:13:04.450
<v Speaker 2>so this is a story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a story.</v>

244
00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:05.770
<v Speaker 2>The story is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

245
00:13:05.771 --> 00:13:06.604
<v Speaker 2>things aren't so good now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're going to be much better in </v>

246
00:13:08.051 --> 00:13:09.730
<v Speaker 2>the future and this is how we're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to bring it about.</v>

247
00:13:09.731 --> 00:13:10.564
<v Speaker 2>That's just your straight linear story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a scenario and you have your </v>

248
00:13:13.121 --> 00:13:13.954
<v Speaker 2>particular story and do you have your </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular story to the degree that you </v>

249
00:13:17.381 --> 00:13:18.214
<v Speaker 2>share cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are some elements of your stories </v>

250
00:13:20.051 --> 00:13:20.884
<v Speaker 2>that are identical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was thinking the mark this other </v>

251
00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:23.291
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

252
00:13:23.291 --> 00:13:24.124
<v Speaker 2>like if you read in the newspaper that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress is going to cut off funding to </v>

253
00:13:28.481 --> 00:13:32.530
<v Speaker 2>a cognitive psychologists who specialize</v>
<v Speaker 2>in vision.</v>

254
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:36.550
<v Speaker 2>Then all of the cognitive psychologists </v>
<v Speaker 2>who specialize in vision,</v>

255
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.193
<v Speaker 2>to the degree that they share that story</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be threatened by that </v>

256
00:13:39.941 --> 00:13:42.910
<v Speaker 2>particular piece of news because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>interfering with their scenario.</v>

257
00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:43.923
<v Speaker 2>They're are going to band together as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>group and they're going to do whatever </v>

258
00:13:45.521 --> 00:13:50.110
<v Speaker 2>they can to to Perry the threat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now if you read that we'll all cognitive</v>

259
00:13:50.111 --> 00:13:52.690
<v Speaker 2>psychologists funding is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>cut,</v>

260
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:53.703
<v Speaker 2>then your reference group is all of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sudden expanded because you pulled in a </v>

261
00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:57.843
<v Speaker 2>larger number of people who share the </v>
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions of your story and then </v>

262
00:14:00.671 --> 00:14:01.504
<v Speaker 2>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

263
00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:02.373
<v Speaker 2>if it was all psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be a larger group and if it </v>

264
00:14:04.241 --> 00:14:06.310
<v Speaker 2>was all uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>academics,</v>

265
00:14:06.311 --> 00:14:09.310
<v Speaker 2>that would be a larger group and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can see that as,</v>

266
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.410
<v Speaker 2>as the threats are more and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental,</v>

267
00:14:11.411 --> 00:14:12.244
<v Speaker 2>the groups that are effected get larger </v>
<v Speaker 2>and larger and well anyways because </v>

268
00:14:15.731 --> 00:14:19.360
<v Speaker 2>you're including more and more people </v>
<v Speaker 2>under the rubric of the same story.</v>

269
00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.300
<v Speaker 2>If your country is under attack from </v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign forces,</v>

270
00:14:22.301 --> 00:14:27.130
<v Speaker 2>then it's the constitution in a sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's at risk and everything.</v>

271
00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:31.060
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of the trunk of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>presupposition tree so to speak.</v>

272
00:14:31.061 --> 00:14:32.740
<v Speaker 2>And everyone's going to unite against </v>
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

273
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:37.670
<v Speaker 5>threat or virtually everyone is going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>unite against it.</v>

274
00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:41.720
<v Speaker 5>This is like a shared experience for </v>
<v Speaker 5>normal adaptation,</v>

275
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.333
<v Speaker 5>snare and can help.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And thinking like people with anxiety </v>

276
00:14:45.951 --> 00:14:50.270
<v Speaker 5>disorders,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the ideal future would be to get on</v>

277
00:14:50.271 --> 00:14:51.104
<v Speaker 5>the elevator and know and that it would </v>
<v Speaker 5>come and it would go down and there </v>

278
00:14:53.201 --> 00:14:55.940
<v Speaker 5>would be no problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's the unpredictable,</v>

279
00:14:55.941 --> 00:14:56.774
<v Speaker 5>that's the big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like so if the LDL number comes or they </v>

280
00:14:59.361 --> 00:15:02.090
<v Speaker 5>get stuck in the elevator or something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's chaos.</v>

281
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:03.920
<v Speaker 5>Like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the end.</v>

282
00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.700
<v Speaker 5>Predictable expense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I was just wondering on this chart,</v>

283
00:15:07.701 --> 00:15:08.610
<v Speaker 5>like how would you map</v>

284
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:09.790
<v Speaker 2>oh well the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

285
00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:11.450
<v Speaker 2>The thing is is that any,</v>

286
00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:12.873
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>

287
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:16.800
<v Speaker 2>Phenomena have ambivalent meanings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is something that I referred to</v>

288
00:15:16.801 --> 00:15:18.090
<v Speaker 2>in the chapter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neuropsychology,</v>

289
00:15:18.091 --> 00:15:22.380
<v Speaker 2>is it an event that can be construed </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a particular motivational relevance</v>

290
00:15:22.381 --> 00:15:23.214
<v Speaker 2>from one frame of reference can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>construed from a different frame of </v>

291
00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.400
<v Speaker 2>reference in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a completely different matters.</v>

292
00:15:29.401 --> 00:15:33.450
<v Speaker 2>So let's say you're on your way to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>meeting and you have an anxiety disorder</v>

293
00:15:33.451 --> 00:15:34.980
<v Speaker 2>soul,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're afraid of elevators.</v>

294
00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:36.083
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the elevator doesn't come well with </v>

295
00:15:38.101 --> 00:15:40.710
<v Speaker 2>regards to the story that says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go to the meeting.</v>

296
00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:42.690
<v Speaker 2>Then the fact that the elevator hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>shown up,</v>

297
00:15:42.691 --> 00:15:45.630
<v Speaker 2>it's very anxiety provoking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And perhaps frustrating and punishing,</v>

298
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:49.290
<v Speaker 2>but from fruit with reference to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>frame of reference that says,</v>

299
00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:50.363
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the kind of person who can't </v>

300
00:15:50.881 --> 00:15:51.714
<v Speaker 2>tolerate taking elevators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's relief that not that the elevator </v>

301
00:15:54.691 --> 00:15:58.800
<v Speaker 2>not showing up brings about and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>your neck motor output so to speak,</v>

302
00:15:58.801 --> 00:16:02.970
<v Speaker 2>is a function of the competition between</v>
<v Speaker 2>between those two frames of reference.</v>

303
00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly how that </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition plays out,</v>

304
00:16:05.551 --> 00:16:06.384
<v Speaker 2>but like virtually everything that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can possibly conceive of how has </v>

305
00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:11.453
<v Speaker 2>motivational significance is that vary </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the frame of reference and you do </v>

306
00:16:14.761 --> 00:16:15.594
<v Speaker 2>this to yourself like you can look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is really not complicated enough </v>

307
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:21.833
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'll draw the map that we'll use </v>

308
00:16:24.211 --> 00:16:26.580
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just the note.</v>

309
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:29.090
<v Speaker 5>Well anyways,</v>

310
00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.630
<v Speaker 2>this is actually more like how this </v>
<v Speaker 2>diagram should look.</v>

311
00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:56.510
<v Speaker 2>You get the picture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

312
00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:57.793
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

313
00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:07.910
<v Speaker 2>these are more or less comprehensive </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories and damage to the story can take</v>

314
00:17:08.971 --> 00:17:09.804
<v Speaker 2>place at any level of analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The higher up on the or the the more </v>

315
00:17:13.621 --> 00:17:16.680
<v Speaker 2>inclusive the place at which the damage </v>
<v Speaker 2>takes place.</v>

316
00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:17.723
<v Speaker 2>The more behavioral adaptation is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>rendered useless and the more phenomena </v>

317
00:17:22.351 --> 00:17:25.860
<v Speaker 2>are transformed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once again back into chaos from,</v>

318
00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.753
<v Speaker 2>from from whence they came from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mythological perspective as you'll find </v>

319
00:17:29.911 --> 00:17:30.744
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause the next thing you're going to do </v>

320
00:17:32.251 --> 00:17:33.084
<v Speaker 2>is read the Sumerian creation myth and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to map it onto the kind of just </v>

321
00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:39.180
<v Speaker 2>descriptions that we'd been talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

322
00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:40.373
<v Speaker 2>the Sumerian creation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a good dream about this last </v>

323
00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.073
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you about it can benefit the </v>

324
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:46.320
<v Speaker 2>Sumerian creation myth is particularly </v>
<v Speaker 2>relevant because,</v>

325
00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.790
<v Speaker 2>well it's been said that history began </v>
<v Speaker 2>in summer.</v>

326
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:54.143
<v Speaker 2>So in a sense it's the most ancient of </v>
<v Speaker 2>creation stories that we have extent </v>

327
00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:58.983
<v Speaker 2>that it has been transmitted down into </v>
<v Speaker 2>our culture along the line that our </v>

328
00:18:03.811 --> 00:18:04.644
<v Speaker 2>culture came from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically I dreamed last night that I </v>

329
00:18:07.321 --> 00:18:08.154
<v Speaker 2>told this class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although the class was like slightly </v>

330
00:18:09.991 --> 00:18:12.990
<v Speaker 2>different in my dream that we all have </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sumerian skeletons.</v>

331
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:15.500
<v Speaker 2>Just in a weird way of looking at what </v>
<v Speaker 2>their point is.</v>

332
00:18:15.501 --> 00:18:16.261
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

333
00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:17.094
<v Speaker 2>it's only been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only about 5,000 years that </v>

334
00:18:18.391 --> 00:18:20.430
<v Speaker 2>separate us from the Sumerians and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>had to take who are,</v>

335
00:18:20.431 --> 00:18:21.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a long time.</v>

336
00:18:21.391 --> 00:18:22.224
<v Speaker 2>We have nothing in common with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a bunch of ways to look at </v>

337
00:18:23.701 --> 00:18:27.090
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's only 60 80 year old men,</v>

338
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.823
<v Speaker 2>so we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which if you think about that 80 years </v>

339
00:18:31.321 --> 00:18:32.880
<v Speaker 2>old and then another 80 year old man and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so on,</v>

340
00:18:32.881 --> 00:18:36.860
<v Speaker 2>that's only 60 entire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moderately long lifespan.</v>

341
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:37.950
<v Speaker 2>This is nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

342
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.170
<v Speaker 2>and it's nothing when the evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

343
00:18:40.171 --> 00:18:43.170
<v Speaker 2>because we'd been around as well as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a species.</v>

344
00:18:43.171 --> 00:18:47.790
<v Speaker 2>Exactly like we are for 150,000 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>and something similar to what we are for</v>

345
00:18:47.791 --> 00:18:50.390
<v Speaker 2>at least 2 million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like 5,000 tears.</v>

346
00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.290
<v Speaker 2>That's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's yesterday.</v>

347
00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.273
<v Speaker 2>We're still scenarios.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you read that creation myth where </v>

348
00:18:55.651 --> 00:18:58.920
<v Speaker 2>you want to think about it with relate </v>
<v Speaker 2>in relationship to the things we've been</v>

349
00:18:58.921 --> 00:19:00.630
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Sumerian say,</v>

350
00:19:00.631 --> 00:19:03.870
<v Speaker 2>well everything emerges from chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what the hell does that mean?</v>

351
00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:04.883
<v Speaker 2>Well it means</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means most basically that everything </v>

352
00:19:08.491 --> 00:19:13.140
<v Speaker 2>that you understand comes from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>domain that has not yet been explored.</v>

353
00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:16.860
<v Speaker 2>That's a chaotic domain cause he can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>say anything about it.</v>

354
00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:17.843
<v Speaker 2>There's no distinctions drawn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus it has infinite motivational </v>

355
00:19:20.431 --> 00:19:21.900
<v Speaker 2>relevance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can specify it.</v>

356
00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:23.970
<v Speaker 2>That's very chaotic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ken.</v>

357
00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:28.200
<v Speaker 2>Those things that you haven't yet </v>
<v Speaker 2>explored are simultaneously punishing,</v>

358
00:19:28.201 --> 00:19:29.034
<v Speaker 2>satisfying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and threatening and promising all at </v>

359
00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:32.850
<v Speaker 2>once and none of those as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>

360
00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:36.130
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

361
00:19:36.131 --> 00:19:37.560
<v Speaker 2>when I say things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

362
00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:38.773
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interference with a structure of this </v>

363
00:19:43.261 --> 00:19:44.094
<v Speaker 2>sort of reduces everything to chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that chaos is in some sense equivalent </v>

364
00:19:47.851 --> 00:19:51.240
<v Speaker 2>to the chaos that existed before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>creation of things.</v>

365
00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:53.070
<v Speaker 2>That's what all that means is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

366
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:54.023
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just think about it as a </v>

367
00:19:54.691 --> 00:19:57.120
<v Speaker 2>metaphorical language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

368
00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:00.790
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a better model.</v>

369
00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:02.703
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

370
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:04.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to use the university example,</v>

371
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:11.190
<v Speaker 2>all cognitive scientist specializing </v>
<v Speaker 2>envision would be here and all cognitive</v>

372
00:20:11.351 --> 00:20:15.010
<v Speaker 2>psychologists would be here and that all</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologists would be here.</v>

373
00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:20.140
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of looking at it anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

374
00:20:20.141 --> 00:20:20.974
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

375
00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:29.020
<v Speaker 2>recipe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

376
00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:30.333
<v Speaker 2>When you're talking to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were talking about how much anxiety </v>

377
00:20:32.741 --> 00:20:35.290
<v Speaker 2>is caused by the absence of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>elevator.</v>

378
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:36.423
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're referring to it as a function of </v>

379
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:43.710
<v Speaker 2>what your interpretive scheme is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also how much of it has to do with a</v>

380
00:20:45.131 --> 00:20:49.720
<v Speaker 2>sort of more basic biological function </v>
<v Speaker 2>of how much tolerance,</v>

381
00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given individual has or unknown.</v>

382
00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:53.853
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a tough question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it looks like there are all </v>

383
00:20:57.191 --> 00:21:00.370
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these four systems so to speak.</v>

384
00:21:00.371 --> 00:21:02.740
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the satisfaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>punishment,</v>

385
00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.960
<v Speaker 2>promise and hope systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From the subjective perspective,</v>

386
00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:12.730
<v Speaker 2>they all seem to have thresholds for </v>
<v Speaker 2>activation.</v>

387
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:18.510
<v Speaker 2>So if your threshold for activation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your incentive reward system is low,</v>

388
00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.180
<v Speaker 2>it looks like you're likely to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>extroverted.</v>

389
00:21:22.181 --> 00:21:24.730
<v Speaker 2>You're very happy and social situations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you smile easily,</v>

390
00:21:24.731 --> 00:21:25.840
<v Speaker 2>you talked a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

391
00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:29.350
<v Speaker 2>And that's something that's biologically</v>
<v Speaker 2>determined.</v>

392
00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.810
<v Speaker 2>And the same with regards to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>response to threat.</v>

393
00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:32.643
<v Speaker 2>You could have a high level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a high threshold or low threshold and </v>

394
00:21:34.631 --> 00:21:35.464
<v Speaker 2>you make dilla well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then it really gets complicated </v>

395
00:21:37.841 --> 00:21:38.674
<v Speaker 2>because the problem is is that what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>construe as threatening or promising </v>

396
00:21:43.091 --> 00:21:45.070
<v Speaker 2>depends on your framework of </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation.</v>

397
00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.650
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows how that plays into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>biology.</v>

398
00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:48.763
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether those two things can be </v>

399
00:21:51.221 --> 00:21:54.730
<v Speaker 2>separated because well I think in </v>
<v Speaker 2>principle they can be,</v>

400
00:21:54.731 --> 00:21:57.730
<v Speaker 2>because I think it would be possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say if I,</v>

401
00:21:57.731 --> 00:22:01.420
<v Speaker 2>if you and I both went into the lab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lab,</v>

402
00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:02.381
<v Speaker 2>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

403
00:22:02.381 --> 00:22:05.020
<v Speaker 2>we're under the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more or less the same set of precepts.</v>

404
00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:05.913
<v Speaker 2>We're governed by the same set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions in that laboratory </v>

405
00:22:07.781 --> 00:22:10.840
<v Speaker 2>circumstance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So say they give us both a goal directed</v>

406
00:22:10.841 --> 00:22:15.841
<v Speaker 2>task that's very bounded and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a set of phenomenal occurs and,</v>

407
00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:21.130
<v Speaker 2>and I get more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more anxious by physiological measures,</v>

408
00:22:21.131 --> 00:22:21.964
<v Speaker 2>then you do well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>assuming that we've held the framework </v>

409
00:22:24.191 --> 00:22:25.024
<v Speaker 2>of reference constant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we might be able to say something about </v>

410
00:22:26.741 --> 00:22:29.500
<v Speaker 2>the intrinsic biological differences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's very,</v>

411
00:22:29.501 --> 00:22:34.180
<v Speaker 2>it strikes me as very difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't the interpretation.</v>

412
00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:37.120
<v Speaker 2>We have pastors that are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>dependent on what we imagined,</v>

413
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:40.360
<v Speaker 2>how we naturally react anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would suspect so.</v>

414
00:22:40.361 --> 00:22:41.194
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

415
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:42.093
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I really don't know the answer to </v>

416
00:22:43.271 --> 00:22:44.650
<v Speaker 2>your question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

417
00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:47.103
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's obviously the case that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can modulate the motivational </v>

418
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:53.590
<v Speaker 2>significance of phenomena merely by </v>
<v Speaker 2>shifting frameworks of reference.</v>

419
00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:55.210
<v Speaker 2>I think you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

420
00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:00.100
<v Speaker 2>if you're very upset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>save just a relationship you had is just</v>

421
00:23:00.101 --> 00:23:02.140
<v Speaker 2>broken up and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

422
00:23:02.141 --> 00:23:02.974
<v Speaker 2>while this is finally going to kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you have very temp temporally </v>

423
00:23:06.161 --> 00:23:10.000
<v Speaker 2>bounded interpretation of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is absolutely catastrophic and what</v>

424
00:23:10.001 --> 00:23:11.650
<v Speaker 2>am I going to do tomorrow?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you think,</v>

425
00:23:11.651 --> 00:23:14.890
<v Speaker 2>well</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this really going to mean anything in</v>

426
00:23:14.891 --> 00:23:15.724
<v Speaker 2>five years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know from that perspective like </v>

427
00:23:18.191 --> 00:23:22.090
<v Speaker 2>how relevant is this phenomena with </v>
<v Speaker 2>regards to my five year plan,</v>

428
00:23:22.091 --> 00:23:22.924
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's relevance is going to shrink </v>

429
00:23:24.371 --> 00:23:25.204
<v Speaker 2>dramatically.</v>

430
00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:26.133
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how much is it gonna mean to me in </v>

431
00:23:28.361 --> 00:23:30.340
<v Speaker 2>40 years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you think,</v>

432
00:23:30.341 --> 00:23:33.460
<v Speaker 2>well under those circumstances it </v>
<v Speaker 2>dwindles to absolute triviality.</v>

433
00:23:33.461 --> 00:23:35.920
<v Speaker 2>And you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what does any of this going to mean</v>

434
00:23:35.921 --> 00:23:38.680
<v Speaker 2>in a thousand years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you have an existential crisis.</v>

435
00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:41.050
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can,</v>

436
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.943
<v Speaker 2>that's an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very interesting because you can </v>

437
00:23:43.001 --> 00:23:43.834
<v Speaker 2>modulate the motivational relevance of </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomena by shifting your framework of </v>

438
00:23:46.671 --> 00:23:47.504
<v Speaker 2>reference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks to me that paper by John </v>

439
00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:50.850
<v Speaker 2>Duncan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first paper in here,</v>

440
00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:54.530
<v Speaker 2>me in a sense that's sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he says the frontal cortex does,</v>

441
00:23:54.531 --> 00:23:56.840
<v Speaker 2>at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that I think,</v>

442
00:23:56.841 --> 00:23:58.430
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going back to the neuro psych,</v>

443
00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:00.553
<v Speaker 2>I think the near the frontal cortex says</v>
<v Speaker 2>hijack the more motivational systems to </v>

444
00:24:04.041 --> 00:24:06.860
<v Speaker 2>give us increased adaptive flexibility </v>
<v Speaker 2>like animals.</v>

445
00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this gets us into a big argument,</v>

446
00:24:09.921 --> 00:24:13.250
<v Speaker 2>a big disagreement about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitutes an unconditioned stimulus.</v>

447
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:14.083
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of behaviors think there are such </v>

448
00:24:15.741 --> 00:24:16.574
<v Speaker 2>things as unconditioned stimulus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are just those things that you </v>

449
00:24:19.071 --> 00:24:22.040
<v Speaker 2>will respond to automatically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like electric shock,</v>

450
00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:23.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's bad.</v>

451
00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:24.973
<v Speaker 2>It's anxiety provoking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While more particularly it's punishing </v>

452
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:30.530
<v Speaker 2>if it's of sufficient intensity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hurts.</v>

453
00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:32.960
<v Speaker 2>But the problem with that is is that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

454
00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.540
<v Speaker 2>you can take a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

455
00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:36.620
<v Speaker 2>And if you give it food just after your </v>
<v Speaker 2>shock,</v>

456
00:24:36.621 --> 00:24:37.820
<v Speaker 2>it soon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you shock it,</v>

457
00:24:37.821 --> 00:24:38.654
<v Speaker 2>it wags its tail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that means that the effect of </v>

458
00:24:41.001 --> 00:24:45.650
<v Speaker 2>relevance of the unconditioned stimulus </v>
<v Speaker 2>is at least modifiable by learning.</v>

459
00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:49.550
<v Speaker 2>And almost all I'm conditioned so called</v>
<v Speaker 2>unconditioned stimuli,</v>

460
00:24:49.551 --> 00:24:52.340
<v Speaker 2>have that property.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

461
00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.720
<v Speaker 2>and we know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

462
00:24:53.721 --> 00:24:54.554
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have an immense amount of </v>

463
00:24:55.911 --> 00:24:58.910
<v Speaker 2>disagreement about what constitutes good</v>
<v Speaker 2>goods.</v>

464
00:24:58.911 --> 00:25:01.670
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like anorexics don't like food.</v>

465
00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:04.100
<v Speaker 2>And they starve to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a bad decision.</v>

466
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:07.490
<v Speaker 2>But the point is is that even something </v>
<v Speaker 2>as fundamental as food,</v>

467
00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:08.593
<v Speaker 2>the motivational relevance of that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>be shifted by shift in the framework of </v>

468
00:25:11.751 --> 00:25:12.200
<v Speaker 2>reference.</v>

469
00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.033
<v Speaker 2>So you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the anorexic is caught in a </v>

470
00:25:13.941 --> 00:25:16.940
<v Speaker 2>situation where her unvariable present </v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

471
00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my terribly fat body,</v>

472
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:20.900
<v Speaker 2>although no one else might construe it </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

473
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:23.210
<v Speaker 2>in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that manner that's hers and her ideal</v>

474
00:25:23.211 --> 00:25:24.044
<v Speaker 2>future is I'm thin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinner than anyone else and that </v>

475
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.870
<v Speaker 2>there's an associate of network around </v>
<v Speaker 2>fin so to speak,</v>

476
00:25:29.871 --> 00:25:31.760
<v Speaker 2>that includes beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well liked,</v>

477
00:25:31.761 --> 00:25:32.930
<v Speaker 2>admired rich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

478
00:25:32.931 --> 00:25:34.460
<v Speaker 2>whatever the hell you want to throw in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

479
00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:35.623
<v Speaker 2>And in relation that makes food in </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship to the movement from here </v>

480
00:25:39.231 --> 00:25:40.064
<v Speaker 2>to here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something punishing and threatening </v>

481
00:25:40.881 --> 00:25:41.714
<v Speaker 2>because it interferes with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then it takes on the motivational </v>

482
00:25:43.701 --> 00:25:46.670
<v Speaker 2>significance of a threat or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>punishment.</v>

483
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.070
<v Speaker 2>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well she still gets hungry.</v>

484
00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's going to be a heavy,</v>

485
00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:54.470
<v Speaker 2>heavy dose of internal conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an internal conflict.</v>

486
00:25:54.471 --> 00:25:58.070
<v Speaker 2>Means in part is you're internally </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflicted about a stimulus.</v>

487
00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:01.820
<v Speaker 2>If it has one significance for one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your plans.</v>

488
00:26:01.821 --> 00:26:02.654
<v Speaker 2>And an alternate significance for </v>
<v Speaker 2>another plan and you have an integrated </v>

489
00:26:04.671 --> 00:26:05.504
<v Speaker 2>the two plans into something that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a higher order construction where </v>

490
00:26:10.911 --> 00:26:13.430
<v Speaker 2>there's no conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that that's a problem.</v>

491
00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:18.120
<v Speaker 5>You're saying how if you're too rude by </v>
<v Speaker 5>your ideal future,</v>

492
00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:22.890
<v Speaker 5>crazy anxiety</v>
<v Speaker 5>or if you're an,</v>

493
00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:25.880
<v Speaker 5>you don't have cause you sense of how </v>
<v Speaker 5>the teacher and if you don't move.</v>

494
00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:28.540
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is there some kind,</v>

495
00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:31.880
<v Speaker 5>and then even talking about about </v>
<v Speaker 5>relativity perspective a year,</v>

496
00:26:31.881 --> 00:26:32.714
<v Speaker 5>four years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>four years and is there such a thing as </v>

497
00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:38.210
<v Speaker 5>a balance because there's what four </v>
<v Speaker 5>universally,</v>

498
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:41.630
<v Speaker 5>what is enough of just sort of move you </v>
<v Speaker 5>on?</v>

499
00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:43.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you know this is,</v>

500
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.830
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the things we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>hope cancer over the course of the whole</v>

501
00:26:46.831 --> 00:26:48.150
<v Speaker 2>course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I said,</v>

502
00:26:48.151 --> 00:26:48.984
<v Speaker 2>well in a sense I said everything is </v>
<v Speaker 2>relative because you can shift the </v>

503
00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:54.630
<v Speaker 2>motivational significance of phenomena </v>
<v Speaker 2>by shifting your frame of reference.</v>

504
00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:56.640
<v Speaker 2>But also said that if you think food is </v>
<v Speaker 2>evil,</v>

505
00:26:56.641 --> 00:27:01.641
<v Speaker 2>you'll start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So obviously there's those two arguments</v>

506
00:27:02.041 --> 00:27:05.160
<v Speaker 2>in a sense or in conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is possible for you to believe</v>

507
00:27:05.161 --> 00:27:08.400
<v Speaker 2>that food is a punishing item.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you do believe that there will be</v>

508
00:27:08.401 --> 00:27:09.234
<v Speaker 2>certain consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you won't be able to pursue any </v>

509
00:27:11.341 --> 00:27:14.400
<v Speaker 2>other plans because you'll be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

510
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:16.763
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in trying to resolve the </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument that those two arguments are </v>

511
00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.950
<v Speaker 2>resolved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem that those two arguments set</v>

512
00:27:22.951 --> 00:27:23.784
<v Speaker 2>up on the one hand while we need to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although people can regard food as a </v>

513
00:27:26.851 --> 00:27:28.020
<v Speaker 2>punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the other hand,</v>

514
00:27:28.021 --> 00:27:32.280
<v Speaker 2>you can switch the motivational valence </v>
<v Speaker 2>of things by an with an act of will,</v>

515
00:27:32.281 --> 00:27:33.114
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

516
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.073
<v Speaker 2>So it strikes me that there's a high </v>
<v Speaker 2>probability that certain phenomena will </v>

517
00:27:39.931 --> 00:27:40.764
<v Speaker 2>be regarded as satisfactions and we'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>take on the aspects of consumer Tory </v>

518
00:27:44.311 --> 00:27:46.710
<v Speaker 2>rewards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of those high probability items,</v>

519
00:27:46.711 --> 00:27:47.940
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is food.</v>

520
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.430
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I have a quote here.</v>

521
00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.970
<v Speaker 2>We'll show you this quote</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Nietzsche.</v>

522
00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:57.570
<v Speaker 2>Nietzsche said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone who considers the basic drives of</v>

523
00:27:57.571 --> 00:28:00.640
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very sophisticated idea.</v>

524
00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:01.483
<v Speaker 2>It's a 100 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll find that all of them have done </v>

525
00:28:04.441 --> 00:28:05.274
<v Speaker 2>philosophy at some time and that every </v>
<v Speaker 2>single one of them would like only too </v>

526
00:28:09.811 --> 00:28:14.430
<v Speaker 2>well to represent just itself as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimate purpose of existence and as the</v>

527
00:28:14.431 --> 00:28:18.900
<v Speaker 2>legitimate master of all the other drugs</v>
<v Speaker 2>for every drive one is to be master kind</v>

528
00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:21.030
<v Speaker 2>of attempts to philosophize in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>spirit.</v>

529
00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:22.493
<v Speaker 2>So I've been trying to resolve this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these dilemmas that are posing the </v>

530
00:28:27.031 --> 00:28:27.930
<v Speaker 2>dilemma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

531
00:28:27.931 --> 00:28:30.630
<v Speaker 2>that shock has this significance of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconditioned stimulus,</v>

532
00:28:30.631 --> 00:28:31.530
<v Speaker 2>but it can be shifted.</v>

533
00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:36.180
<v Speaker 2>It looks to me that what happens is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>these underlying biological systems like</v>

534
00:28:36.181 --> 00:28:40.620
<v Speaker 2>the one that governs hunger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has the capacity to grip,</v>

535
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:45.900
<v Speaker 2>to gain access to the representational </v>
<v Speaker 2>system that constructs these futures.</v>

536
00:28:45.901 --> 00:28:46.950
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

537
00:28:46.951 --> 00:28:50.370
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're basically doing your homework and</v>

538
00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:51.653
<v Speaker 2>you haven't eaten for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now your warp rating within a </v>

539
00:28:54.271 --> 00:28:55.890
<v Speaker 2>particular frame of reference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>

540
00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:56.993
<v Speaker 2>the action of doing your homework is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a motor program that's part of a </v>

541
00:29:02.011 --> 00:29:05.490
<v Speaker 2>larger series of goals and sub goals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

542
00:29:05.491 --> 00:29:06.990
<v Speaker 2>Graduation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>career and all that.</v>

543
00:29:06.991 --> 00:29:09.960
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're busily pursuing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you haven't eaten well.</v>

544
00:29:09.961 --> 00:29:13.110
<v Speaker 2>So what happens is that your attention </v>
<v Speaker 2>starts to get diverted,</v>

545
00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:17.100
<v Speaker 2>which basically means that the system </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's responsible for ensuring that you</v>

546
00:29:17.101 --> 00:29:17.934
<v Speaker 2>get enough calories has started to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has started to take control of the </v>

547
00:29:21.121 --> 00:29:24.660
<v Speaker 2>representational system and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>constructs your ideal futures.</v>

548
00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:28.020
<v Speaker 2>So you start thinking about food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's another,</v>

549
00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:33.240
<v Speaker 2>a fantasy that's making itself known in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the theater of your imagination.</v>

550
00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:38.570
<v Speaker 2>And if you keep doing your homework and </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't eat long enough while you're going</v>

551
00:29:38.571 --> 00:29:39.404
<v Speaker 2>to start feeling conflict because you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>switching between these two control </v>

552
00:29:43.391 --> 00:29:46.330
<v Speaker 2>systems basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sooner or later in all likelihood,</v>

553
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:48.063
<v Speaker 2>the system that mediates food intake is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get the upper hand and you'll </v>

554
00:29:49.991 --> 00:29:50.740
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

555
00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:51.573
<v Speaker 2>to hell with it because that's your </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation from the perspective of </v>

556
00:29:55.331 --> 00:29:58.240
<v Speaker 2>finishing your homework and you'll go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fridge and get something to eat.</v>

557
00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.890
<v Speaker 2>So when nature says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all our drives a template,</v>

558
00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:03.740
<v Speaker 2>philosophize basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see this is the way you fit.</v>

559
00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:04.653
<v Speaker 2>The reason I'm trying to tell you this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is because it gets away from the notion </v>

560
00:30:07.541 --> 00:30:08.374
<v Speaker 2>of stimulus response because it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your hunger isn't driving you towards </v>

561
00:30:12.461 --> 00:30:13.294
<v Speaker 2>the fridge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like it's gripping your </v>

562
00:30:14.531 --> 00:30:15.640
<v Speaker 2>behavioral output.</v>

563
00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:21.250
<v Speaker 2>What it's doing is positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a potential future towards which you can</v>

564
00:30:21.251 --> 00:30:24.190
<v Speaker 2>plan and it has the capacity to grip </v>
<v Speaker 2>that future.</v>

565
00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:28.330
<v Speaker 2>That's Nietzsche's attempts of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>drives to philosophize.</v>

566
00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.530
<v Speaker 2>So you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you think about this,</v>

567
00:30:30.531 --> 00:30:34.540
<v Speaker 2>so we defined pathology in this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Often say,</v>

568
00:30:34.541 --> 00:30:37.390
<v Speaker 2>well if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if everything in your life boils down to</v>

569
00:30:37.391 --> 00:30:39.910
<v Speaker 2>food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's your God.</v>

570
00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:41.683
<v Speaker 2>Say That's your ideal futures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you eating as much and as often as </v>

571
00:30:43.841 --> 00:30:44.674
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then we would say somethings </v>

572
00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:47.853
<v Speaker 2>something is pathological about your </v>
<v Speaker 2>scheme of representation or your </v>

573
00:30:52.031 --> 00:30:52.864
<v Speaker 2>behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something's pathological about your </v>

574
00:30:53.951 --> 00:30:54.784
<v Speaker 2>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While part of the reason we say that is </v>

575
00:30:55.871 --> 00:31:00.520
<v Speaker 2>because food is a good sub goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's necessary sub goal,</v>

576
00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:01.743
<v Speaker 2>but it's a bad ultimate master.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While the question in part that we're </v>

577
00:31:04.781 --> 00:31:06.730
<v Speaker 2>going to try to address in this class </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

578
00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:11.440
<v Speaker 2>well given that food saying sex and </v>
<v Speaker 2>water and heat and shelter and all these</v>

579
00:31:11.441 --> 00:31:16.441
<v Speaker 2>other things are necessary sub goals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would constitute the ideal master?</v>

580
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:19.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you read this,</v>

581
00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:23.260
<v Speaker 2>you want to read this Sumerian creation </v>
<v Speaker 2>myth with this in mind.</v>

582
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:26.110
<v Speaker 2>So I say these are gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's one way of looking at it.</v>

583
00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.090
<v Speaker 2>It's a little bit more complicated than </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

584
00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.700
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

585
00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:32.500
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's another quote.</v>

586
00:31:32.501 --> 00:31:33.880
<v Speaker 2>This is quite funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think too,</v>

587
00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:38.260
<v Speaker 2>this is from Eliana with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sumerian mythology.</v>

588
00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:39.363
<v Speaker 2>It is true that man was created in order</v>
<v Speaker 2>to serve the gods who first of all </v>

589
00:31:41.981 --> 00:31:46.510
<v Speaker 2>needed to be fed and clothed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not such a,</v>

590
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:49.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not such a foreign conception really.</v>

591
00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:50.223
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guards are construed as </v>

592
00:31:51.401 --> 00:31:54.280
<v Speaker 2>transpersonal processes that are eternal</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally,</v>

593
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:55.833
<v Speaker 2>and a man mortal man is created in order</v>
<v Speaker 2>to ensure that their needs are </v>

594
00:32:00.401 --> 00:32:02.410
<v Speaker 2>fulfilled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

595
00:32:02.411 --> 00:32:03.244
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to think at least some of </v>

596
00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.350
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna think that that's a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a leap.</v>

597
00:32:05.351 --> 00:32:08.860
<v Speaker 2>But</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite interesting to read the,</v>

598
00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:09.783
<v Speaker 2>the Mesopotamian creation myth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and part of what it entails is </v>

599
00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:17.320
<v Speaker 2>hierarchical competition between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gods and the eventual victory of one God</v>

600
00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:18.163
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as part of the movement towards </v>

601
00:32:19.001 --> 00:32:19.650
<v Speaker 2>monotheism.</v>

602
00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:20.990
<v Speaker 2>And Marduk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

603
00:32:20.991 --> 00:32:25.991
<v Speaker 2>is the one God who reveals himself as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the top of the hierarchy.</v>

604
00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.560
<v Speaker 2>And what more Martech represents is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity to explore.</v>

605
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:34.060
<v Speaker 2>So the Mesopotamian creation myth based </v>
<v Speaker 2>because Marduk it's very interesting.</v>

606
00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:39.130
<v Speaker 2>MARTICA carves tie mat up tire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt is a dragon.</v>

607
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:41.780
<v Speaker 2>She represents chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's also the mother of all things.</v>

608
00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:44.600
<v Speaker 2>Marta carves tie that up and makes the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world out of her.</v>

609
00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:46.490
<v Speaker 2>It makes the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes the earth,</v>

610
00:32:46.491 --> 00:32:48.890
<v Speaker 2>makes the Zodiac.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He makes one.</v>

611
00:32:48.891 --> 00:32:51.710
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of this is very amusing,</v>

612
00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:55.820
<v Speaker 2>one of Mark's names cause he has like </v>
<v Speaker 2>200 names because actually he's a,</v>

613
00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:58.530
<v Speaker 2>he's a mixture of gods.</v>

614
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:01.603
<v Speaker 2>Mesopotamian culture was made up of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole bunch of subcultures that mailed </v>

615
00:33:03.921 --> 00:33:04.754
<v Speaker 2>it over a long period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all those subcultures had their own </v>

616
00:33:06.201 --> 00:33:09.860
<v Speaker 2>gods and they all got sort of mixed </v>
<v Speaker 2>together to make Martech.</v>

617
00:33:09.861 --> 00:33:11.900
<v Speaker 2>So Murdoch had a whole bunch of names </v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of his names,</v>

618
00:33:11.901 --> 00:33:12.734
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the maker of ingenious things from </v>

619
00:33:15.471 --> 00:33:17.480
<v Speaker 2>the combat with Tire Mat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very,</v>

620
00:33:17.481 --> 00:33:18.770
<v Speaker 2>very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>

621
00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:19.963
<v Speaker 2>the Mesopotamians figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although they didn't know they had </v>

622
00:33:21.831 --> 00:33:25.190
<v Speaker 2>figured it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they figured out that the thing to which</v>

623
00:33:25.191 --> 00:33:28.950
<v Speaker 2>all these other drive should be made </v>
<v Speaker 2>subordinate was the thing that was Marta</v>

624
00:33:28.951 --> 00:33:29.784
<v Speaker 2>and Martin was the thing that carve new </v>
<v Speaker 2>territory out of unexplored territory </v>

625
00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:33.733
<v Speaker 2>because basically they manage to presume</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you didn't arrange your life so </v>

626
00:33:38.781 --> 00:33:41.180
<v Speaker 2>that you could constantly generate new </v>
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>

627
00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:44.750
<v Speaker 2>everything would come to a halt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everything should be made subordinate</v>

628
00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.153
<v Speaker 2>to this capacity to encounter the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown and generate new information on </v>

629
00:33:50.511 --> 00:33:51.344
<v Speaker 2>it because all of the other drives were </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary dependent for their </v>

630
00:33:54.981 --> 00:33:58.280
<v Speaker 2>fulfillment on that particular function.</v>

631
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.200
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

632
00:34:00.201 --> 00:34:02.480
<v Speaker 2>it's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's once you understand,</v>

633
00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:03.333
<v Speaker 2>if you understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you understand something that's </v>

634
00:34:04.491 --> 00:34:05.324
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the reason why I think I </v>

635
00:34:07.101 --> 00:34:12.101
<v Speaker 2>dreamt last night we had Sumerian </v>
<v Speaker 2>skeletons because now there's more to it</v>

636
00:34:12.321 --> 00:34:13.154
<v Speaker 2>than this of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because Marduk was also the ritual </v>

637
00:34:16.941 --> 00:34:19.550
<v Speaker 2>mortal of emulation for the Mesopotamian</v>
<v Speaker 2>emperor,</v>

638
00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:22.970
<v Speaker 2>which basically meant that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mesopotamian emperor was emperor because</v>

639
00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:24.043
<v Speaker 2>in a sense he was Marduk and only to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>degree that he was Marta was he granted </v>

640
00:34:27.291 --> 00:34:29.570
<v Speaker 2>any sort of divine status and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>emperors,</v>

641
00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:33.140
<v Speaker 2>the embodiment of the state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course our state now as a body of</v>

642
00:34:33.141 --> 00:34:35.840
<v Speaker 2>laws and not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a human body because we don't have a</v>

643
00:34:35.841 --> 00:34:36.674
<v Speaker 2>monarchy anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the point is is that states only </v>

644
00:34:38.451 --> 00:34:43.170
<v Speaker 2>work too if they recognize that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>property that Marta incarnated is,</v>

645
00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:44.313
<v Speaker 2>is the thing of most central importance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the capacity of the capacity </v>

646
00:34:48.201 --> 00:34:50.870
<v Speaker 2>for exploration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

647
00:34:51.410 --> 00:34:53.180
<v Speaker 2>that was a good digression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

648
00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:54.613
<v Speaker 2>neuropsychology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to bounce around these </v>

649
00:34:56.331 --> 00:34:57.980
<v Speaker 2>things in order to get a picture of them</v>
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

650
00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:00.553
<v Speaker 2>now the question,</v>

651
00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.210
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

652
00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:18.293
<v Speaker 2>Well they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that that's the ideal solution at </v>

653
00:35:20.101 --> 00:35:21.900
<v Speaker 2>least as far as the Sumerians were </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned.</v>

654
00:35:21.901 --> 00:35:22.734
<v Speaker 2>And like we're going to explore the </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences of that solution as a </v>

655
00:35:25.801 --> 00:35:26.634
<v Speaker 2>solution because it has a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a whole series of important </v>

656
00:35:30.301 --> 00:35:32.460
<v Speaker 2>implications.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a solution.</v>

657
00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:35.550
<v Speaker 2>Now I happen to think it's really a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>solution,</v>

658
00:35:35.551 --> 00:35:36.420
<v Speaker 2>but we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

659
00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 2>we'll see how plays out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

660
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:39.120
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the thing is</v>

661
00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:41.453
<v Speaker 6>you're not determined so to speak </v>
<v Speaker 6>because the stimulus doesn't control </v>

662
00:35:45.811 --> 00:35:48.360
<v Speaker 6>your behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nonetheless.</v>

663
00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:49.253
<v Speaker 6>There are certain you are constrained,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is to say you have boundaries and </v>

664
00:35:52.231 --> 00:35:56.100
<v Speaker 6>I can say with a high probability in a </v>
<v Speaker 6>broad variety of conditions,</v>

665
00:35:56.250 --> 00:36:01.250
<v Speaker 6>what you are likely to consider a </v>
<v Speaker 6>conservatory reward.</v>

666
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:02.393
<v Speaker 6>And I can say that because you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>composed in part of specialized </v>

667
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:08.310
<v Speaker 6>subsystems,</v>
<v Speaker 6>each of which have a stake,</v>

668
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:13.290
<v Speaker 6>each of which have their own job pluses,</v>
<v Speaker 6>stake in maintenance of the whole unit,</v>

669
00:36:13.291 --> 00:36:15.390
<v Speaker 6>which is you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they want what they want,</v>

670
00:36:15.391 --> 00:36:17.790
<v Speaker 6>but they also want you to stay around so</v>
<v Speaker 6>to speak,</v>

671
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.420
<v Speaker 6>because without you nothing happens.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's what the Sumerians meant when</v>

672
00:36:21.421 --> 00:36:23.910
<v Speaker 6>they said that men were created to serve</v>
<v Speaker 6>the gods.</v>

673
00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:29.330
<v Speaker 6>So the relativity is modulated by the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fact that you have a number of competing</v>

674
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:32.670
<v Speaker 6>tasks constantly to perform.</v>

675
00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:33.923
<v Speaker 7>Uh Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So well that's why that's one way of </v>

676
00:36:36.981 --> 00:36:39.830
<v Speaker 7>construing it anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So question</v>

677
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:45.500
<v Speaker 7>systems or these,</v>
<v Speaker 7>can they ever,</v>

678
00:36:45.501 --> 00:36:48.980
<v Speaker 7>in cases of really extreme severe </v>
<v Speaker 7>deprivation,</v>

679
00:36:48.981 --> 00:36:52.490
<v Speaker 7>can they directly grab control of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>motor output or must they always go,</v>

680
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:54.010
<v Speaker 7>they always affect behaviors</v>

681
00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:55.240
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

682
00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:57.970
<v Speaker 6>I suspect,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I suspect that there's probably,</v>

683
00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:04.260
<v Speaker 6>there's both operating like in </v>
<v Speaker 6>situations that are so extreme that</v>

684
00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:10.210
<v Speaker 6>thought would be an interference rather </v>
<v Speaker 6>than an aide,</v>

685
00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:15.100
<v Speaker 6>then I suspect there's direct output.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

686
00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:16.593
<v Speaker 6>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't say anything because that's the </v>

687
00:37:18.461 --> 00:37:21.970
<v Speaker 6>problem with trying to reduce the brain </v>
<v Speaker 6>to one system of operations.</v>

688
00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:23.493
<v Speaker 6>There's evolutionary redundancy in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>brain and often for a given type of </v>

689
00:37:27.611 --> 00:37:28.444
<v Speaker 6>response,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's more than one system that has </v>

690
00:37:30.611 --> 00:37:31.444
<v Speaker 6>the capability for that response.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And there was some circumstances under </v>

691
00:37:34.211 --> 00:37:37.960
<v Speaker 6>which I suspect behavior is directed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>directly controlled,</v>

692
00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:39.423
<v Speaker 6>but I think this is more relevant when </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're trying to weigh potential </v>

693
00:37:45.461 --> 00:37:46.300
<v Speaker 6>alternatives.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

694
00:37:46.301 --> 00:37:47.134
<v Speaker 6>let's say if you're hungry and thirsty </v>
<v Speaker 6>and you haven't been engaged in a </v>

695
00:37:50.231 --> 00:37:53.590
<v Speaker 6>romantic relationship for like a year </v>
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>

696
00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:54.693
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your job is under pressure and you're </v>

697
00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.840
<v Speaker 6>not getting along well with your </v>
<v Speaker 6>children,</v>

698
00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:04.170
<v Speaker 6>well then you have a whole nest of </v>
<v Speaker 6>problems to solve and uh,</v>

699
00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:09.130
<v Speaker 6>an almost infinite number of potential </v>
<v Speaker 6>solutions to those problems.</v>

700
00:38:09.131 --> 00:38:09.964
<v Speaker 6>And I think the role of the higher order</v>
<v Speaker 6>critical systems is to modulate the </v>

701
00:38:13.931 --> 00:38:18.220
<v Speaker 6>fantasies that all of these underlying </v>
<v Speaker 6>systems so to speak,</v>

702
00:38:18.221 --> 00:38:21.550
<v Speaker 6>might produce in order to construct the </v>
<v Speaker 6>optimal outcome.</v>

703
00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.350
<v Speaker 6>And that's well here you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>

704
00:38:23.351 --> 00:38:25.480
<v Speaker 6>this is a story I keep telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a story.</v>

705
00:38:25.481 --> 00:38:26.980
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a vision of paradise.</v>

706
00:38:26.981 --> 00:38:27.814
<v Speaker 6>That's what's up here as the archetype </v>
<v Speaker 6>of ideal future and a vision of </v>

707
00:38:30.431 --> 00:38:32.620
<v Speaker 6>paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well that's the land of milk and honey,</v>

708
00:38:32.621 --> 00:38:33.454
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Where everything is bound to fleet </v>

709
00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 6>provision where every</v>

710
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.910
<v Speaker 2>motivational system is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is properly addressed.</v>

711
00:38:39.911 --> 00:38:40.744
<v Speaker 2>While there's a problem with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewpoint that Dostoyevsky pointed out </v>

712
00:38:42.561 --> 00:38:43.840
<v Speaker 2>and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is this,</v>

713
00:38:43.841 --> 00:38:45.550
<v Speaker 2>that well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if everything's perfect,</v>

714
00:38:45.551 --> 00:38:47.500
<v Speaker 2>everything's predictable and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's predictable,</v>

715
00:38:47.501 --> 00:38:50.410
<v Speaker 2>then you're bored and bored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boredom is not part of perfection.</v>

716
00:38:50.411 --> 00:38:51.244
<v Speaker 2>So perfection is not perfection and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a big problem and that's not a </v>

717
00:38:54.671 --> 00:38:56.470
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully that will be able to address.</v>

718
00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:01.500
<v Speaker 2>It's a big problem because it's a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem because incentive reward,</v>

719
00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:02.973
<v Speaker 2>which is what the unknown producers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a cue for a reward incentive </v>

720
00:39:08.771 --> 00:39:11.350
<v Speaker 2>reward is a more potent driving force </v>
<v Speaker 2>for people.</v>

721
00:39:11.351 --> 00:39:14.020
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then satisfaction and you think,</v>

722
00:39:14.021 --> 00:39:16.390
<v Speaker 2>think about this in with regards to your</v>
<v Speaker 2>own behaviors.</v>

723
00:39:16.391 --> 00:39:17.224
<v Speaker 2>Like often those things say you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>goal in mind and you obtain sub goals </v>

724
00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.390
<v Speaker 2>with relationship to that goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're very,</v>

725
00:39:25.391 --> 00:39:26.224
<v Speaker 2>very excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You actually attain the goal and it's </v>

726
00:39:29.711 --> 00:39:32.950
<v Speaker 2>nowhere near as exciting is </v>
<v Speaker 2>participation in the process.</v>

727
00:39:32.951 --> 00:39:35.560
<v Speaker 2>That led up to the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to say you're more activated by</v>

728
00:39:35.561 --> 00:39:38.620
<v Speaker 2>incentive reward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you are by satisfactions and that's</v>

729
00:39:38.621 --> 00:39:40.390
<v Speaker 2>the thing about people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're like.</v>

730
00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:41.893
<v Speaker 2>That's why we like novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So static conceptions of the ideal </v>

731
00:39:44.531 --> 00:39:45.640
<v Speaker 2>future have an intrinsic</v>

732
00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:46.623
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>

733
00:39:57.370 --> 00:39:58.203
<v Speaker 2>Well the problem is is that getting what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want is not enough to make you </v>

734
00:40:01.481 --> 00:40:02.314
<v Speaker 2>content because contentment is something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that transcends the attainment of </v>

735
00:40:06.971 --> 00:40:09.190
<v Speaker 2>determinant satisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that would be,</v>

736
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:13.690
<v Speaker 2>there's more to the story than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>attainment of a goal that's conceived of</v>

737
00:40:13.691 --> 00:40:17.550
<v Speaker 2>as a final goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that has something well that,</v>

738
00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:18.933
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

739
00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:34.240
<v Speaker 2>Well no I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're making a valid point.</v>

740
00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:35.133
<v Speaker 2>I mean the [inaudible] and fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I guess what I'm talking about </v>

741
00:40:39.161 --> 00:40:43.960
<v Speaker 2>our systems that postulate like </v>
<v Speaker 2>political utopian systems that postulate</v>

742
00:40:43.961 --> 00:40:44.794
<v Speaker 2>that there is a particular manner of </v>
<v Speaker 2>organizing society that will provide a </v>

743
00:40:47.771 --> 00:40:48.604
<v Speaker 2>final salute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>final static solution to all our </v>

744
00:40:50.591 --> 00:40:51.424
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of more or less simplistic utopia </v>

745
00:40:54.011 --> 00:40:57.790
<v Speaker 2>notions do in fact promise that like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Marxism I think would be,</v>

746
00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:02.140
<v Speaker 2>that'd be a system that fits well into </v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of conceptualization.</v>

747
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:03.103
<v Speaker 2>It's just reorganize the essential </v>
<v Speaker 2>building blocks of society will </v>

748
00:41:06.521 --> 00:41:07.354
<v Speaker 2>inevitably produce a future that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone will find ideal and that will </v>

749
00:41:09.881 --> 00:41:13.780
<v Speaker 2>be the final solution so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

750
00:41:13.781 --> 00:41:14.614
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you know that incentive reward</v>
<v Speaker 2>is one of the things that motivates you </v>

751
00:41:18.341 --> 00:41:20.050
<v Speaker 2>and and in a really profound way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

752
00:41:20.051 --> 00:41:20.884
<v Speaker 2>as I've pointed out before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cocaine activates our incentive reward </v>

753
00:41:23.211 --> 00:41:24.340
<v Speaker 2>systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People really like,</v>

754
00:41:24.341 --> 00:41:26.020
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the animals for that matter,</v>

755
00:41:26.021 --> 00:41:28.270
<v Speaker 2>Bill self administer cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Until they die.</v>

756
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:29.703
<v Speaker 2>They like incentive reward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We like incentive reward money is an </v>

757
00:41:32.411 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 2>incentive for example.</v>

758
00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:37.070
<v Speaker 8>Bit.</v>

759
00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:38.960
<v Speaker 2>Once you realize that a lot of things </v>
<v Speaker 2>start,</v>

760
00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:41.630
<v Speaker 2>a lot of weird things start to happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you say,</v>

761
00:41:41.631 --> 00:41:42.464
<v Speaker 2>well for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a perfect world therefore would have to </v>

762
00:41:45.411 --> 00:41:46.244
<v Speaker 2>contain novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that's a strange thing to say </v>

763
00:41:48.351 --> 00:41:49.184
<v Speaker 2>because novelty also induces anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've instantly said in the sense </v>

764
00:41:52.341 --> 00:41:54.560
<v Speaker 2>that a perfect world is also one that </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes you anxious,</v>

765
00:41:54.561 --> 00:41:57.470
<v Speaker 2>which is of course not really in </v>
<v Speaker 2>accordance with the kinds of things that</v>

766
00:41:57.471 --> 00:41:59.930
<v Speaker 2>we would normally consider a perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

767
00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:03.360
<v Speaker 8>are you making the claim that ideal </v>
<v Speaker 8>future is,</v>

768
00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:06.910
<v Speaker 8>is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>is is a world of unlimited exploration?</v>

769
00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:09.741
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

770
00:42:09.741 --> 00:42:12.930
<v Speaker 2>not entirely Daniel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because see,</v>

771
00:42:12.931 --> 00:42:17.310
<v Speaker 2>I kind of thought that in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's more a matter of balance.</v>

772
00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:19.200
<v Speaker 2>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well if this,</v>

773
00:42:19.201 --> 00:42:20.034
<v Speaker 2>if you can represent this as the known,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the thing that's transformed </v>

774
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.160
<v Speaker 2>necessarily by the appearance of </v>
<v Speaker 2>novelty,</v>

775
00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:30.570
<v Speaker 2>it's also a precondition for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity to assimilate novelty.</v>

776
00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:31.883
<v Speaker 2>So you have to know something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to say that part of what makes </v>

777
00:42:34.591 --> 00:42:39.000
<v Speaker 2>you capable of exploring and </v>
<v Speaker 2>assimilating new information is the fact</v>

778
00:42:39.001 --> 00:42:41.820
<v Speaker 2>that you're already composed of static </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures of knowledge.</v>

779
00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:42.983
<v Speaker 2>So you could say the ideal has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore con be composed at least in </v>

780
00:42:47.941 --> 00:42:51.060
<v Speaker 2>part of a balance between what static </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what's normal.</v>

781
00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:54.420
<v Speaker 2>So it isn't just exploration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also,</v>

782
00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:55.283
<v Speaker 2>it's also the security that makes known </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrifying exploration possible and the </v>

783
00:42:59.881 --> 00:43:04.080
<v Speaker 2>security that gives rise to the skills </v>
<v Speaker 2>that make creative exploration possible.</v>

784
00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:05.273
<v Speaker 2>So you get someone like Einstein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Einstein who said he </v>

785
00:43:06.991 --> 00:43:09.630
<v Speaker 2>could see so far cause he stood on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulders of giants.</v>

786
00:43:09.631 --> 00:43:13.590
<v Speaker 2>And that's a good mythological image </v>
<v Speaker 2>because basically what Einstein said was</v>

787
00:43:13.591 --> 00:43:14.424
<v Speaker 2>that he stood on the ground that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>prepared by his dead ancestors and </v>

788
00:43:18.151 --> 00:43:18.984
<v Speaker 2>that's why he could see so far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a matter of balance and you </v>

789
00:43:22.081 --> 00:43:22.914
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what the oriental yen and Yang </v>

790
00:43:24.061 --> 00:43:26.620
<v Speaker 2>symbol basically states too is that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

791
00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:30.480
<v Speaker 2>order is necessary and chaos is </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary.</v>

792
00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:31.643
<v Speaker 2>And the ideal is some balance between </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's where you're supposed to </v>

793
00:43:34.891 --> 00:43:35.600
<v Speaker 2>walk,</v>

794
00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:39.310
<v Speaker 8>would that's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's an eye that same uh,</v>

795
00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:42.170
<v Speaker 8>ideal mode of adoption.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yup.</v>

796
00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.020
<v Speaker 8>Which is answering,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when you say ideal in that context,</v>

797
00:43:45.021 --> 00:43:47.180
<v Speaker 8>you're not talking about the box top </v>
<v Speaker 8>runners.</v>

798
00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:47.941
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then,</v>

799
00:43:47.941 --> 00:43:49.350
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

800
00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:51.390
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I said,</v>

801
00:43:51.391 --> 00:43:52.040
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that,</v>

802
00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:54.750
<v Speaker 2>in their little story there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a grammar of,</v>

803
00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:58.380
<v Speaker 2>there's a simple grammar of the story </v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

804
00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:01.170
<v Speaker 2>which is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is this,</v>

805
00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:03.841
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

806
00:44:03.841 --> 00:44:07.770
<v Speaker 2>this is your kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that or your culture?</v>

807
00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:08.633
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a part of the same culture with </v>

808
00:44:10.921 --> 00:44:12.510
<v Speaker 2>someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you share their story,</v>

809
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:13.463
<v Speaker 2>it's as simple as that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And their story is the manner in which </v>

810
00:44:15.181 --> 00:44:17.010
<v Speaker 2>they have fixed motivational </v>
<v Speaker 2>significance.</v>

811
00:44:17.011 --> 00:44:17.844
<v Speaker 2>Though I'm going to this including you </v>
<v Speaker 2>as an on going in there and to the </v>

812
00:44:20.701 --> 00:44:23.130
<v Speaker 2>degree that you share that scheme of </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation,</v>

813
00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:24.143
<v Speaker 2>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are a part of that culture and </v>

814
00:44:26.131 --> 00:44:27.740
<v Speaker 2>that's because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

815
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:29.680
<v Speaker 2>it's quite straight forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's it.</v>

816
00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:30.923
<v Speaker 2>If you and I share same vision with </v>
<v Speaker 2>regards to the value of a goal and the </v>

817
00:44:33.811 --> 00:44:34.810
<v Speaker 2>means for getting there.</v>

818
00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:36.053
<v Speaker 2>I can predict your behavior and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>predict mind knowing that you can rely </v>

819
00:44:38.791 --> 00:44:39.624
<v Speaker 2>on me and we can cooperate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've just drawn a magic circle </v>

820
00:44:42.991 --> 00:44:46.320
<v Speaker 2>around ourselves so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it eliminates the,</v>

821
00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:50.050
<v Speaker 2>the unpredictable and novel from our </v>
<v Speaker 2>interactions except in very connected,</v>

822
00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:50.893
<v Speaker 2>very constrained matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're a defined territory as far as </v>

823
00:44:54.181 --> 00:44:55.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And vice versa.</v>

824
00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:58.440
<v Speaker 2>We are from the same culture and you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>make very,</v>

825
00:44:58.980 --> 00:44:59.813
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can make very trivial distinctions </v>

826
00:45:02.101 --> 00:45:03.570
<v Speaker 2>within cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

827
00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:04.703
<v Speaker 2>we're both psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're practicing in different </v>

828
00:45:07.021 --> 00:45:09.360
<v Speaker 2>domains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That could easily mean we could split it</v>

829
00:45:09.361 --> 00:45:12.750
<v Speaker 2>into some cultures depending on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>event that's going on.</v>

830
00:45:12.751 --> 00:45:16.530
<v Speaker 2>Because if something threatened your </v>
<v Speaker 2>room subgroup and benefited mind,</v>

831
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:18.660
<v Speaker 2>instantly we fragment because our </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories,</v>

832
00:45:18.661 --> 00:45:21.030
<v Speaker 2>what does the switch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyways,</v>

833
00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:22.223
<v Speaker 2>this is the law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the more comprehensive story </v>

834
00:45:24.241 --> 00:45:25.470
<v Speaker 2>because you have a story.</v>

835
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:28.680
<v Speaker 2>But then there's this story about how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>transform your stories when that becomes</v>

836
00:45:28.681 --> 00:45:33.570
<v Speaker 2>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this is a fixed story and this is</v>

837
00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:34.553
<v Speaker 2>another fixed story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You notice I've structured it so that </v>

838
00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.840
<v Speaker 2>this one's a square here in a circle </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

839
00:45:39.841 --> 00:45:44.220
<v Speaker 2>which is the idea that this is the metal</v>
<v Speaker 2>structure remains the same,</v>

840
00:45:44.221 --> 00:45:45.054
<v Speaker 2>but the details shift not to stage </v>
<v Speaker 2>transition from the Piagetian </v>

841
00:45:49.081 --> 00:45:51.990
<v Speaker 2>perspective or a revolution from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cuny and perspective.</v>

842
00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:57.000
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is blown apart by the appearance of</v>

843
00:45:57.001 --> 00:45:57.834
<v Speaker 2>anomalous information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can think of anomalous </v>

844
00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:03.450
<v Speaker 2>information as the agent of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly weird way of looking at it.</v>

845
00:46:03.451 --> 00:46:04.284
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's anomalous information that follows </v>

846
00:46:06.061 --> 00:46:08.790
<v Speaker 2>this structure apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in initiation rituals,</v>

847
00:46:08.791 --> 00:46:09.624
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they catalyze this sort of </v>

848
00:46:10.411 --> 00:46:13.140
<v Speaker 2>transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I face you with something anomalous.</v>

849
00:46:13.141 --> 00:46:15.990
<v Speaker 2>I blow apart your story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are reduced to chaos.</v>

850
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:17.010
<v Speaker 2>But what does that mean?</v>

851
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:18.263
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means that you have all of the </v>

852
00:46:19.861 --> 00:46:23.640
<v Speaker 2>determinant motivational significance is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have a fixed two events,</v>

853
00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:27.510
<v Speaker 2>including yourself and other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all up for grabs again.</v>

854
00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:30.120
<v Speaker 2>So you're by turns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed,</v>

855
00:46:30.121 --> 00:46:31.200
<v Speaker 2>anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elated,</v>

856
00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:33.990
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your emotional systems are in flux.</v>

857
00:46:33.991 --> 00:46:34.824
<v Speaker 2>And the reason they're in flux is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the metal structure that kept </v>

858
00:46:37.471 --> 00:46:38.304
<v Speaker 2>them integrated has been destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're now subject to the war of </v>

859
00:46:41.071 --> 00:46:43.550
<v Speaker 2>competing emotions basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

860
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:46.350
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a descent into chaos.</v>

861
00:46:46.351 --> 00:46:47.184
<v Speaker 2>And if it's an initiation ceremony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the members of your culture will give </v>

862
00:46:50.701 --> 00:46:51.534
<v Speaker 2>you a new story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say this is the story for these things </v>

863
00:46:53.581 --> 00:46:55.200
<v Speaker 2>usually happen to men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not always.</v>

864
00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:59.580
<v Speaker 2>This is your story for being a man bag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a new framework of reference</v>

865
00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:03.950
<v Speaker 2>that makes your new position now </v>
<v Speaker 2>determinant.</v>

866
00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.660
<v Speaker 2>So then you're up here when you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

867
00:47:06.661 --> 00:47:09.360
<v Speaker 2>well there are different ways of </v>
<v Speaker 2>construing the ideal.</v>

868
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:11.400
<v Speaker 2>If you're a patriot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say</v>

869
00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:16.100
<v Speaker 2>to the degree that I identify with this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm perfect,</v>

870
00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:17.173
<v Speaker 2>I'm moral.</v>

871
00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:20.553
<v Speaker 2>If you're identifying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one form of perfection and you </v>

872
00:47:24.101 --> 00:47:26.950
<v Speaker 2>can see the utility to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do people do that all the time?</v>

873
00:47:26.951 --> 00:47:28.930
<v Speaker 2>Even when they're identifying with </v>
<v Speaker 2>football teams for</v>

874
00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:32.693
<v Speaker 2>there's a more profound type of </v>
<v Speaker 2>identification and that would be </v>

875
00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:36.153
<v Speaker 2>identification with the process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the capability to undergo this </v>

876
00:47:39.701 --> 00:47:44.530
<v Speaker 2>process identification with the capacity</v>
<v Speaker 2>for transformation.</v>

877
00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.341
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

878
00:47:45.341 --> 00:47:46.174
<v Speaker 2>that that ties back with your earlier </v>
<v Speaker 2>comment about viewing yourself as well </v>

879
00:47:50.561 --> 00:47:53.500
<v Speaker 2>as someone who's capable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only of adhering to stories,</v>

880
00:47:53.501 --> 00:47:56.680
<v Speaker 2>but if generating and modifying them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a much,</v>

881
00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:58.300
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

882
00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:59.463
<v Speaker 2>I want you to read this next section on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Marta with this sort of thing in mind </v>

883
00:48:01.961 --> 00:48:02.794
<v Speaker 2>because again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what the Mesopotamians positive </v>

884
00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.660
<v Speaker 2>as ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

885
00:48:07.661 --> 00:48:09.730
<v Speaker 2>the k,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the emperor of Mesopotamia,</v>

886
00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:12.790
<v Speaker 2>every new year when the year is </v>
<v Speaker 2>regenerated,</v>

887
00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:14.830
<v Speaker 2>you can view this as the year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

888
00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:17.560
<v Speaker 2>from the Mesopotamian perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

889
00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:19.503
<v Speaker 2>the king was ritually reduced to chaos </v>
<v Speaker 2>and reconstituted at the beginning of </v>

890
00:48:22.931 --> 00:48:25.600
<v Speaker 2>every new year from the Mesopotamian </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

891
00:48:25.601 --> 00:48:28.450
<v Speaker 2>that was equivalent to reduction of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

892
00:48:28.451 --> 00:48:31.390
<v Speaker 2>the cosmos to its constituent elements </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then renewal.</v>

893
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:34.690
<v Speaker 2>That's a comment that's the most common </v>
<v Speaker 2>of mythological themes by the way.</v>

894
00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:36.923
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

895
00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:41.990
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exploration is necessary because you and</v>

896
00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:45.280
<v Speaker 2>everything else is going to change </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you like it or not.</v>

897
00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:48.460
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then wouldn't,</v>

898
00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:49.413
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be not necessarily active </v>

899
00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:52.023
<v Speaker 2>exploration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but exploration when you need to </v>

900
00:48:54.311 --> 00:48:55.780
<v Speaker 2>explore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

901
00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:56.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fair enough.</v>

902
00:48:56.801 --> 00:49:00.010
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about the ideal is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideal state that you are,</v>

903
00:49:00.011 --> 00:49:03.700
<v Speaker 2>the ideal future is wanting to make sure</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're always actively,</v>

904
00:49:03.701 --> 00:49:04.600
<v Speaker 2>it's no or no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

905
00:49:04.610 --> 00:49:05.130
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

906
00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:05.411
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

907
00:49:05.411 --> 00:49:06.350
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

908
00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:09.100
<v Speaker 2>you're alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reformulation is more accurate,</v>

909
00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:10.443
<v Speaker 2>has its exploration when it's necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to say that you need to know </v>

910
00:49:13.451 --> 00:49:18.220
<v Speaker 2>what you know so you don't have to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for trouble necessarily or be an</v>

911
00:49:18.221 --> 00:49:20.920
<v Speaker 2>agent of change for the sake of being an</v>
<v Speaker 2>agent of change.</v>

912
00:49:20.921 --> 00:49:25.921
<v Speaker 2>But if you detect an anomaly which which</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do it voluntarily,</v>

913
00:49:26.831 --> 00:49:28.540
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing about how your brain is</v>
<v Speaker 2>set up.</v>

914
00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:31.100
<v Speaker 2>If something anomalous happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you notice it.</v>

915
00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:35.140
<v Speaker 2>Once you notice it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's incumbent on you to alter your</v>

916
00:49:35.141 --> 00:49:35.974
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not necessarily the case that </v>

917
00:49:38.021 --> 00:49:39.910
<v Speaker 2>you have to be actively going about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

918
00:49:39.911 --> 00:49:41.680
<v Speaker 2>While I would exhaust you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

919
00:49:41.681 --> 00:49:43.480
<v Speaker 2>I think in some ways that's what happens</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

920
00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:45.910
<v Speaker 2>Paranoid schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think this is,</v>

921
00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:47.950
<v Speaker 2>you might think that this is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>another leap,</v>

922
00:49:47.951 --> 00:49:50.280
<v Speaker 2>but if you read graze article in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>

923
00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:52.890
<v Speaker 2>Gray has a theory of the neuropsychology</v>
<v Speaker 2>of schizophrenia.</v>

924
00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:53.743
<v Speaker 2>What happens to schizophrenia is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>novelty starts appearing over where it </v>

925
00:49:57.461 --> 00:49:58.294
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to say that the inhibitory </v>

926
00:49:59.441 --> 00:50:04.441
<v Speaker 2>structure that stops meaning from being </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced has been disrupted.</v>

927
00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:05.493
<v Speaker 2>So for the poor schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meanings are popping up everywhere and </v>

928
00:50:07.931 --> 00:50:12.931
<v Speaker 2>meaning means this signifies something </v>
<v Speaker 2>usually something threatening.</v>

929
00:50:13.601 --> 00:50:14.434
<v Speaker 2>It's something promising that attracts </v>
<v Speaker 2>your attention to the poor </v>

930
00:50:16.031 --> 00:50:18.250
<v Speaker 2>schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His attention is always attracted.</v>

931
00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:19.383
<v Speaker 2>It's part of the reason that paranoid </v>
<v Speaker 2>schizophrenia or hypervigilant and what </v>

932
00:50:22.211 --> 00:50:27.211
<v Speaker 2>happens to them is that I think is well </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

933
00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:29.870
<v Speaker 2>if something appears as meaningful to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

934
00:50:29.871 --> 00:50:33.230
<v Speaker 2>that activates your exploration system </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's dope and surgically mediated.</v>

935
00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:36.740
<v Speaker 2>Well that explains in part the hyper </v>
<v Speaker 2>dopamine Nirjah,</v>

936
00:50:36.741 --> 00:50:38.930
<v Speaker 2>that's characteristic of schizophrenia </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the hyper vigilance.</v>

937
00:50:38.931 --> 00:50:42.200
<v Speaker 2>But the problem with that is that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on all the time,</v>

938
00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:43.243
<v Speaker 2>you'll kill those systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what happens to </v>

939
00:50:44.841 --> 00:50:47.540
<v Speaker 2>schizophrenia when they go into second </v>
<v Speaker 2>stage schizophrenia,</v>

940
00:50:47.541 --> 00:50:50.540
<v Speaker 2>which is characterized by no flat out </v>
<v Speaker 2>effect and,</v>

941
00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:54.380
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Parkinson light symptoms.</v>

942
00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:55.753
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

943
00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:59.420
<v Speaker 2>it's not so good to be on all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what's funny because a common,</v>

944
00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:02.030
<v Speaker 2>a common,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mythological ideal is piece,</v>

945
00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:02.691
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

946
00:51:02.691 --> 00:51:03.524
<v Speaker 2>and that would seem to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would seem to be specifically not </v>

947
00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:08.690
<v Speaker 2>upset maybe when you're here to to </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintain peace.</v>

948
00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:09.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

949
00:51:09.591 --> 00:51:10.424
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then there's this the contrary </v>

950
00:51:12.081 --> 00:51:13.850
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a perfectly valid point.</v>

951
00:51:13.851 --> 00:51:14.684
<v Speaker 2>But there's the contrary argument and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think this is an argument that the red </v>

952
00:51:17.901 --> 00:51:19.590
<v Speaker 2>queen and there wasn't wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

953
00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:23.240
<v Speaker 2>she said you have to run as fast as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can just to stay where you are.</v>

954
00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:28.370
<v Speaker 2>So which is to say that a static mode of</v>
<v Speaker 2>adaptation is not,</v>

955
00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:33.020
<v Speaker 2>is no adaptation at all systems age all </v>
<v Speaker 2>by themselves.</v>

956
00:51:33.021 --> 00:51:33.854
<v Speaker 2>So you have to stay very active in order</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to maintain things the way they </v>

957
00:51:37.461 --> 00:51:39.310
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's,</v>

958
00:51:39.330 --> 00:51:40.690
<v Speaker 2>you don't necessarily have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>running,</v>

959
00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:41.653
<v Speaker 2>running all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean absolutely come to a sort of a </v>

960
00:51:44.721 --> 00:51:48.200
<v Speaker 2>peaceful existence with yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're living in the woods or something.</v>

961
00:51:48.201 --> 00:51:50.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah know and Y'all are in here and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were completely happy with it.</v>

962
00:51:50.811 --> 00:51:51.644
<v Speaker 2>Well you're not going to have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to have to do a lot of </v>

963
00:51:52.791 --> 00:51:54.490
<v Speaker 2>active change in less.</v>

964
00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:57.200
<v Speaker 2>Your situation changes or you change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

965
00:51:57.201 --> 00:51:59.420
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a complex,</v>

966
00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:00.553
<v Speaker 2>it's a complex issue because you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>also by expiration you can also produce </v>

967
00:52:04.101 --> 00:52:04.641
<v Speaker 2>a normal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

968
00:52:04.641 --> 00:52:07.520
<v Speaker 2>it's not necessarily the case that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>just happened to you.</v>

969
00:52:07.850 --> 00:52:09.140
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know your,</v>

970
00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:11.420
<v Speaker 2>I've got no argument at all with what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you say.</v>

971
00:52:11.421 --> 00:52:13.610
<v Speaker 2>It's a matter of balance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the point is is that,</v>

972
00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:15.950
<v Speaker 2>well Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Egypt for example,</v>

973
00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:17.203
<v Speaker 2>stayed stable for about 3000 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to say that as far as modern </v>

974
00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:22.303
<v Speaker 2>archeologists are able to determine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a 30 century period where the </v>

975
00:52:26.061 --> 00:52:30.140
<v Speaker 2>fundamental substructures of Egyptian </v>
<v Speaker 2>society state exactly the same.</v>

976
00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:34.070
<v Speaker 2>And the Egyptians were convinced as are </v>
<v Speaker 2>many traditional societies,</v>

977
00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:35.173
<v Speaker 2>that change meant death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can understand that because any </v>

978
00:52:38.781 --> 00:52:39.614
<v Speaker 2>cultural innovation is all cultural </v>
<v Speaker 2>innovations have the capacity to </v>

979
00:52:42.561 --> 00:52:44.360
<v Speaker 2>undermine the cultures that produce </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

980
00:52:44.361 --> 00:52:48.560
<v Speaker 2>So many cultures off for restasis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is is,</v>

981
00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:50.060
<v Speaker 2>and three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they think,</v>

982
00:52:50.061 --> 00:52:52.040
<v Speaker 2>well we have a good thing and that sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of play around with it.</v>

983
00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:56.120
<v Speaker 2>It's like biological mutations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good analogy.</v>

984
00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:02.060
<v Speaker 2>Most biological mutations kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you think every innovation is in the</v>

985
00:53:02.061 --> 00:53:04.130
<v Speaker 2>cultural sphere and analogy to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mutation,</v>

986
00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:07.310
<v Speaker 2>but the one in every thousand mutations </v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't kill you,</v>

987
00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:09.950
<v Speaker 2>it's necessary for the survival of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>species.</v>

988
00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:13.260
<v Speaker 2>So it's a very strange balance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that,</v>

989
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:15.450
<v Speaker 2>does that argument make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that didn't know what to you?</v>

990
00:53:15.451 --> 00:53:16.940
<v Speaker 2>Makes Sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

991
00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:26.150
<v Speaker 3>how do you explain things like marriage?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why isn't the divorce</v>

992
00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:28.353
<v Speaker 7>was seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or even if you love like a have a </v>

993
00:53:30.370 --> 00:53:31.203
<v Speaker 7>favorite song or like a rarity,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the same person or decades that's got </v>

994
00:53:35.251 --> 00:53:37.820
<v Speaker 7>like that's gotta be boring after a </v>
<v Speaker 7>while.</v>

995
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.940
<v Speaker 7>I mean there's no,</v>

996
00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:42.000
<v Speaker 2>maybe it does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it has to be meaning you</v>

997
00:53:42.001 --> 00:53:44.760
<v Speaker 2>also have the capacity to shift </v>
<v Speaker 2>frameworks of reference.</v>

998
00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:46.260
<v Speaker 2>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

999
00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:47.213
<v Speaker 2>so you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean especially with something as </v>

1000
00:53:48.811 --> 00:53:51.930
<v Speaker 2>complex as another person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think you know someone else,</v>

1001
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:54.150
<v Speaker 2>that's only a delusion that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this,</v>

1002
00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:56.810
<v Speaker 2>the extent of your knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you,</v>

1003
00:53:56.910 --> 00:54:00.210
<v Speaker 2>if what you see is what you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>habituated to,</v>

1004
00:54:00.211 --> 00:54:02.640
<v Speaker 2>then what you see is what you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>habituated to,</v>

1005
00:54:02.641 --> 00:54:06.150
<v Speaker 2>not what's there because you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what that other person is like.</v>

1006
00:54:06.151 --> 00:54:08.220
<v Speaker 2>And perhaps they've fallen into the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn game,</v>

1007
00:54:08.221 --> 00:54:11.010
<v Speaker 2>which is they play out the rule you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>specified for them.</v>

1008
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:13.260
<v Speaker 2>But that's your tough luck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1009
00:54:13.261 --> 00:54:14.094
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good answer with regards to </v>

1010
00:54:15.991 --> 00:54:16.824
<v Speaker 2>marriage anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean with regards to simpler </v>

1011
00:54:19.711 --> 00:54:21.560
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you know,</v>

1012
00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:24.030
<v Speaker 2>you can move from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from thing to thing and people do that.</v>

1013
00:54:24.031 --> 00:54:24.864
<v Speaker 2>But so part of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the human capacity for </v>

1014
00:54:26.371 --> 00:54:29.310
<v Speaker 2>expiration is also to see what hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>been mapped.</v>

1015
00:54:29.311 --> 00:54:30.144
<v Speaker 2>Where are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where people think everything is </v>

1016
00:54:31.770 --> 00:54:32.603
<v Speaker 2>understood</v>

1017
00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:37.430
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but her point,</v>

1018
00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:38.693
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>brings up something interesting to me </v>

1019
00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:44.450
<v Speaker 5>when you boil into chaos and then you go</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you go to any place,</v>

1020
00:54:44.451 --> 00:54:45.830
<v Speaker 5>can you take part of the old system?</v>

1021
00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:46.961
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1022
00:54:46.961 --> 00:54:47.910
<v Speaker 2>I've looked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look with,</v>

1023
00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:48.813
<v Speaker 2>this is another thing you want to read </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you go through this next chapter </v>

1024
00:54:50.981 --> 00:54:53.320
<v Speaker 2>because part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh Huh.</v>

1025
00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:55.900
<v Speaker 2>That Pharaoh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Egyptian Pharaoh for example,</v>

1026
00:54:55.901 --> 00:54:58.180
<v Speaker 2>who's a nice Mesopotamian emperor </v>
<v Speaker 2>analog,</v>

1027
00:54:58.181 --> 00:55:00.250
<v Speaker 2>although a little later down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>historical chain,</v>

1028
00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:01.473
<v Speaker 2>he was simultaneously the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Pharaoh who had died and the new </v>

1029
00:55:04.631 --> 00:55:05.464
<v Speaker 2>pharaoh always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that meant basically that he was </v>

1030
00:55:08.471 --> 00:55:11.720
<v Speaker 2>both ocirus and horace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how the Egyptians construed it.</v>

1031
00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:11.991
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1032
00:55:11.991 --> 00:55:12.824
<v Speaker 2>serious was the old pharaoh who </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically was confined to the </v>

1033
00:55:15.881 --> 00:55:19.600
<v Speaker 2>underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Horace was the process that gave new</v>

1034
00:55:19.601 --> 00:55:23.620
<v Speaker 2>life to the pharaoh or Cirrus who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>confined in the underworld.</v>

1035
00:55:23.621 --> 00:55:24.454
<v Speaker 2>So the new pharaoh was simultaneously </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that had already been </v>

1036
00:55:26.921 --> 00:55:30.670
<v Speaker 2>learned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plus the process that allows you to make</v>

1037
00:55:30.671 --> 00:55:33.550
<v Speaker 2>use of everything that's already been </v>
<v Speaker 2>learned in a creative manner.</v>

1038
00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:35.460
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1039
00:55:35.830 --> 00:55:36.663
<v Speaker 2>so of course this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why this is the structure is the </v>

1040
00:55:38.921 --> 00:55:41.830
<v Speaker 2>same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if this is composed of this,</v>

1041
00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:45.670
<v Speaker 2>plus this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so which is to say that when you make,</v>

1042
00:55:45.730 --> 00:55:47.800
<v Speaker 2>when there's a revolution in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

1043
00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:52.000
<v Speaker 2>what you use is everything you already </v>
<v Speaker 2>knew,</v>

1044
00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:52.953
<v Speaker 2>plus the information that has been in </v>
<v Speaker 2>gendered by your contact or your </v>

1045
00:55:55.931 --> 00:55:58.210
<v Speaker 2>assimilation up via normal ist </v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

1046
00:55:58.750 --> 00:56:00.010
<v Speaker 2>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just give you,</v>

1047
00:56:00.011 --> 00:56:00.844
<v Speaker 2>this is kind of funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is often represented as a </v>

1048
00:56:03.281 --> 00:56:05.710
<v Speaker 2>serpent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the serpent of chaos for the Egyptians.</v>

1049
00:56:05.711 --> 00:56:09.610
<v Speaker 2>That was Adam and Adam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the most primordial of gods who</v>

1050
00:56:09.611 --> 00:56:10.444
<v Speaker 2>ruled at the beginning of the time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>who will once again rule at the end of </v>

1051
00:56:12.641 --> 00:56:13.474
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's sort of the place that </v>

1052
00:56:14.471 --> 00:56:16.630
<v Speaker 2>everything came from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a serpent anyways,</v>

1053
00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:18.310
<v Speaker 2>when you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1054
00:56:18.311 --> 00:56:22.420
<v Speaker 2>the structure of the story in genesis of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adam and eve in this,</v>

1055
00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:25.300
<v Speaker 2>in this little as well because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1056
00:56:25.330 --> 00:56:28.150
<v Speaker 2>anomalous information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm jumping ahead and man,</v>

1057
00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:29.283
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anomalous information is often given a </v>

1058
00:56:31.361 --> 00:56:32.194
<v Speaker 2>feminine form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you'll see when we go through </v>

1059
00:56:34.421 --> 00:56:36.850
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1060
00:56:36.851 --> 00:56:37.684
<v Speaker 2>because anything anomalous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a hypo hypothetical state is </v>

1061
00:56:40.391 --> 00:56:40.870
<v Speaker 2>chaos.</v>

1062
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:41.703
<v Speaker 2>You can say it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all the unknown that you haven't </v>

1063
00:56:43.091 --> 00:56:46.180
<v Speaker 2>encountered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can't say anything about that because</v>

1064
00:56:46.181 --> 00:56:47.980
<v Speaker 2>it's not actually part of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

1065
00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:48.963
<v Speaker 2>It's just a hypothesis about the source </v>
<v Speaker 2>of all those things you don't </v>

1066
00:56:51.491 --> 00:56:53.710
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not those things themselves.</v>

1067
00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:55.293
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when something anomalous actually makes </v>

1068
00:56:57.491 --> 00:57:00.280
<v Speaker 2>itself manifest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to say that you're,</v>

1069
00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:01.900
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1070
00:57:01.901 --> 00:57:02.734
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>following your story and something </v>

1071
00:57:03.581 --> 00:57:04.414
<v Speaker 2>unexpected happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then something has something actually </v>

1072
00:57:06.851 --> 00:57:09.370
<v Speaker 2>unexpected has happened to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1073
00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:13.510
<v Speaker 2>it's in exploring that unexpected thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you generate new information.</v>

1074
00:57:13.511 --> 00:57:14.344
<v Speaker 2>So you could think of the unexpected </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you experience as the Matrix of </v>

1075
00:57:17.861 --> 00:57:20.020
<v Speaker 2>everything that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's the source.</v>

1076
00:57:20.890 --> 00:57:23.110
<v Speaker 2>It's the source of everything that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1077
00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:24.063
<v Speaker 2>you have to explore it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's still the place where </v>

1078
00:57:25.271 --> 00:57:27.370
<v Speaker 2>information comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A matrix.</v>

1079
00:57:27.371 --> 00:57:30.460
<v Speaker 2>I use that word because it said in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>logically related to mother in any ways.</v>

1080
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:32.710
<v Speaker 2>This is often given feminine feminine </v>
<v Speaker 2>form.</v>

1081
00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:33.573
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Matrix of things absolutely matters </v>

1082
00:57:35.771 --> 00:57:37.220
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1083
00:57:37.570 --> 00:57:38.500
<v Speaker 2>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1084
00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:41.793
<v Speaker 2>well it's a complicated thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The serpent gives the crude to even the </v>

1085
00:57:46.061 --> 00:57:49.480
<v Speaker 2>story of genesis and producers of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>complete collapse.</v>

1086
00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:50.693
<v Speaker 2>That's the rise of self consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the genesis story in Christian </v>

1087
00:57:52.751 --> 00:57:56.020
<v Speaker 2>morality is the attempt to get from here</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to here.</v>

1088
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:59.280
<v Speaker 2>Well in a sense that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways,</v>

1089
00:57:59.290 --> 00:58:00.123
<v Speaker 2>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another example of how these </v>

1090
00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:01.953
<v Speaker 2>sorts of things tied together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me just show you this cartoon </v>

1091
00:58:05.261 --> 00:58:07.420
<v Speaker 2>because I might otherwise forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is quite funny.</v>

1092
00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:11.380
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just a cartoon.</v>

1093
00:58:11.381 --> 00:58:15.670
<v Speaker 2>It sort of illustrates how we do respond</v>
<v Speaker 2>to things that we understand.</v>

1094
00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:20.700
<v Speaker 2>Things that we don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

1095
00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:23.890
<v Speaker 2>The reason this cartoon is funny of </v>
<v Speaker 2>course,</v>

1096
00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:24.733
<v Speaker 2>is because you don't sit around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>campfire at night and talking about the </v>

1097
00:58:26.721 --> 00:58:28.530
<v Speaker 2>things you understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1098
00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:30.800
<v Speaker 2>They don't have any motivation with </v>
<v Speaker 2>significant steps.</v>

1099
00:58:30.850 --> 00:58:35.850
<v Speaker 2>That's why you think you understand the</v>
<v Speaker 2>tales of the note.</v>

1100
00:58:38.590 --> 00:58:42.820
<v Speaker 2>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also well in embedded in,</v>

1101
00:58:42.821 --> 00:58:43.654
<v Speaker 2>this is also the notion that the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have explored don't have a lot of </v>

1102
00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:50.050
<v Speaker 2>effect of valence anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're not very interesting and it's</v>

1103
00:58:50.051 --> 00:58:50.884
<v Speaker 2>unknown things that are interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the campfire and make it more </v>

1104
00:58:54.731 --> 00:58:57.530
<v Speaker 2>effective to tell a story arc all </v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

1105
00:58:57.580 --> 00:58:58.271
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1106
00:58:58.271 --> 00:59:00.160
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1107
00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:01.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

1108
00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:04.660
<v Speaker 2>Penn Penn rules around the campfire at </v>
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>

1109
00:59:04.661 --> 00:59:06.190
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pans the God who lives,</v>

1110
00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:10.660
<v Speaker 2>who lives in the forest and who causes </v>
<v Speaker 2>panic basically.</v>

1111
00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:11.583
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the God that inhabits the forest </v>

1112
00:59:13.631 --> 00:59:17.650
<v Speaker 2>because the forest is unknown territory </v>
<v Speaker 2>and unknown territory produces a seizure</v>

1113
00:59:17.651 --> 00:59:21.070
<v Speaker 2>of ongoing activity is associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety.</v>

1114
00:59:21.590 --> 00:59:22.423
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1115
00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:25.890
<v Speaker 7>so if you have this conception of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>future,</v>

1116
00:59:25.891 --> 00:59:26.750
<v Speaker 7>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1117
00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:30.750
<v Speaker 7>being perfect and happy and that has </v>
<v Speaker 7>some goals of being successful and being</v>

1118
00:59:30.751 --> 00:59:35.751
<v Speaker 7>an academic and being a psychologist</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then something happens that disrupts</v>

1119
00:59:36.531 --> 00:59:37.364
<v Speaker 7>you or your interest in or your faith </v>
<v Speaker 7>and your ability to do cognitive </v>

1120
00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:42.400
<v Speaker 7>psychology and so that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that particular style going,</v>

1121
00:59:42.401 --> 00:59:43.234
<v Speaker 7>we'll get plunged into chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you come back up with this idea of </v>

1122
00:59:44.911 --> 00:59:46.550
<v Speaker 7>being a developmental psychologist.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

1123
00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:47.401
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Absolutely.</v>

1124
00:59:47.401 --> 00:59:50.700
<v Speaker 7>That without affecting your larger goal.</v>

1125
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:52.790
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just did it in that example.</v>

1126
00:59:52.791 --> 00:59:54.050
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1127
00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:55.033
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

1128
00:59:55.170 --> 00:59:56.003
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>does it,</v>

1129
00:59:56.530 --> 00:59:58.890
<v Speaker 7>and can it ever happened in isolation,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Justin and support?</v>

1130
00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:00.090
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1131
01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:01.710
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1132
01:00:01.711 --> 01:00:03.270
<v Speaker 2>And then it doesn't provoke that much </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety.</v>

1133
01:00:03.271 --> 01:00:04.170
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why,</v>

1134
01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:05.540
<v Speaker 2>well that's all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1135
01:00:05.541 --> 01:00:08.280
<v Speaker 2>Like when all the time for the meeting </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's just a disruption.</v>

1136
01:00:08.281 --> 01:00:10.530
<v Speaker 2>It was absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1137
01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:11.563
<v Speaker 2>And that's a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing that's so neat about </v>

1138
01:00:12.901 --> 01:00:14.880
<v Speaker 2>this and like a tree by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a very,</v>

1139
01:00:14.881 --> 01:00:17.340
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very common figure in mythology.</v>

1140
01:00:17.610 --> 01:00:18.870
<v Speaker 2>The tree of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

1141
01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:21.450
<v Speaker 2>I really believe that's what it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>referring to is this.</v>

1142
01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:26.070
<v Speaker 2>It's the tree like structure that holds </v>
<v Speaker 2>your motivational systems in check.</v>

1143
01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:27.353
<v Speaker 2>So you can lose like minor league </v>
<v Speaker 2>branches or you could lose things that </v>

1144
01:00:30.841 --> 01:00:32.840
<v Speaker 2>are close to the trunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a,</v>

1145
01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:34.063
<v Speaker 2>that's a very big catastrophe spend you </v>
<v Speaker 2>looms whole Schema is of actions in an </v>

1146
01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:38.813
<v Speaker 2>interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretations that whole entire </v>

1147
01:00:40.081 --> 01:00:43.530
<v Speaker 2>sections of your experience in </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivational check.</v>

1148
01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:46.490
<v Speaker 2>So given that they have any priority </v>
<v Speaker 2>significance,</v>

1149
01:00:46.491 --> 01:00:50.460
<v Speaker 2>you're try to restrict that significance</v>
<v Speaker 2>to some useful domain always when you're</v>

1150
01:00:50.461 --> 01:00:52.030
<v Speaker 2>trying to do so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you own it,</v>

1151
01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.920
<v Speaker 7>have adapt to things that affect some </v>
<v Speaker 7>goals on some level,</v>

1152
01:00:54.921 --> 01:00:55.790
<v Speaker 7>I you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because if you,</v>

1153
01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:56.713
<v Speaker 7>if something happens that draws into </v>
<v Speaker 7>question like let's say your most </v>

1154
01:01:00.201 --> 01:01:02.180
<v Speaker 7>fundamental like the trunk of the tree,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1155
01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.610
<v Speaker 7>And you adapt from that or do you just,</v>

1156
01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:06.350
<v Speaker 2>that's part of what we're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>address in this class.</v>

1157
01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:08.120
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can say,</v>

1158
01:01:08.121 --> 01:01:11.870
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best story is the one that addresses</v>

1159
01:01:11.871 --> 01:01:14.060
<v Speaker 2>the widest range of potential </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon,</v>

1160
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.931
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>

1161
01:01:14.931 --> 01:01:16.160
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mythologies,</v>

1162
01:01:16.161 --> 01:01:19.760
<v Speaker 2>collect mythologies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>distill the best story.</v>

1163
01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:20.713
<v Speaker 2>So what we're going to try to do is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what the best story is </v>

1164
01:01:23.661 --> 01:01:24.494
<v Speaker 2>because the best story is the one that </v>
<v Speaker 2>has the largest domain of potential </v>

1165
01:01:28.971 --> 01:01:29.990
<v Speaker 2>relevance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could say,</v>

1166
01:01:29.991 --> 01:01:31.460
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the big problem?</v>

1167
01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:32.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big problem for example,</v>

1168
01:01:32.721 --> 01:01:33.670
<v Speaker 2>might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1169
01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:37.070
<v Speaker 2>the fact of human mortality because that</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be the,</v>

1170
01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:39.560
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the anomalous phenomena,</v>

1171
01:01:39.561 --> 01:01:43.310
<v Speaker 2>which puts the determinant significance </v>
<v Speaker 2>of everything into dispute.</v>

1172
01:01:43.850 --> 01:01:45.620
<v Speaker 2>So how can you adapt to that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1173
01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:46.880
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the question.</v>

1174
01:01:46.881 --> 01:01:48.890
<v Speaker 2>Say That's at the bottom of Christian </v>
<v Speaker 2>morality.</v>

1175
01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:51.260
<v Speaker 2>You view it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm using Christian morality.</v>

1176
01:01:51.261 --> 01:01:52.094
<v Speaker 2>Just as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you view the rise of self </v>

1177
01:01:54.531 --> 01:01:55.910
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1178
01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:56.833
<v Speaker 2>one of the concomitants of the rise of </v>
<v Speaker 2>self consciousness is the knowledge of </v>

1179
01:01:59.211 --> 01:02:01.310
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that the two things are very closely</v>

1180
01:02:01.311 --> 01:02:03.320
<v Speaker 2>linked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're self conscious,</v>

1181
01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:05.810
<v Speaker 2>that means you can conceive of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>boundaries.</v>

1182
01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:06.673
<v Speaker 2>That's what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you have spatial boundaries and you </v>

1183
01:02:08.631 --> 01:02:09.620
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they kind of bother you,</v>

1184
01:02:09.621 --> 01:02:11.180
<v Speaker 2>but you can move from one place to </v>
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

1185
01:02:11.181 --> 01:02:14.090
<v Speaker 2>So that's not such a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the temporal boundary.</v>

1186
01:02:14.091 --> 01:02:16.760
<v Speaker 2>That's the big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question is,</v>

1187
01:02:16.761 --> 01:02:17.594
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you adapt to the fact a temporal </v>

1188
01:02:19.801 --> 01:02:20.910
<v Speaker 2>boundary?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1189
01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:25.340
<v Speaker 2>obviously this is a very tough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult question about talk.</v>

1190
01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:29.040
<v Speaker 2>It's the sort of thing that we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of what,</v>

1191
01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:31.800
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1192
01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:35.490
<v Speaker 2>part of what I'm interested in trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand is why people get so horribly</v>

1193
01:02:35.491 --> 01:02:37.560
<v Speaker 2>twisted as they mature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1194
01:02:37.561 --> 01:02:40.560
<v Speaker 2>there's lots of reasons for it there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're pretty much plainly evident.</v>

1195
01:02:40.610 --> 01:02:41.443
<v Speaker 2>Like in many ways the world is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible place and there's sufficient </v>

1196
01:02:43.681 --> 01:02:48.300
<v Speaker 2>reason all the time for people to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>twisted off the path.</v>

1197
01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:49.193
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think often it's more surprising that </v>

1198
01:02:50.791 --> 01:02:51.624
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't happen all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it is surprising that it sometimes </v>

1199
01:02:54.571 --> 01:02:55.930
<v Speaker 2>happens well,</v>

1200
01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:01.773
<v Speaker 5>well</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're growing up in a family that </v>

1201
01:03:06.550 --> 01:03:09.640
<v Speaker 5>maybe doesn't have this normal </v>
<v Speaker 5>adaptation,</v>

1202
01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:12.250
<v Speaker 5>I've seen these things are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1203
01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:13.343
<v Speaker 5>caught up in stuff holds or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 5>something traumatic happened that </v>

1204
01:03:15.761 --> 01:03:20.761
<v Speaker 5>affects one of your fundamental Schema.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's prob definitely,</v>

1205
01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:24.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the,</v>

1206
01:03:24.290 --> 01:03:26.240
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that in itself is not enough.</v>

1207
01:03:26.241 --> 01:03:27.074
<v Speaker 2>Like I think that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a necessary but not sufficient </v>

1208
01:03:29.811 --> 01:03:31.130
<v Speaker 2>precondition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can say,</v>

1209
01:03:31.131 --> 01:03:33.200
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people never like,</v>

1210
01:03:33.201 --> 01:03:34.034
<v Speaker 2>if you're lucky you at least start here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people never bloody well even get </v>

1211
01:03:36.561 --> 01:03:37.394
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>

1212
01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:40.520
<v Speaker 2>they were born and this is where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>stay and that's terrible for them,</v>

1213
01:03:40.521 --> 01:03:42.800
<v Speaker 2>but if it possible to stay there without</v>
<v Speaker 2>being entirely insane,</v>

1214
01:03:42.830 --> 01:03:46.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean because anyone who functions at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all how good the Schema,</v>

1215
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.300
<v Speaker 2>because you have to have a go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you are working toward something.</v>

1216
01:03:51.070 --> 01:03:54.140
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not necessarily don't necessarily,</v>

1217
01:03:54.141 --> 01:03:54.974
<v Speaker 2>you have to allow yourself the </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility that there may be something </v>

1218
01:03:57.201 --> 01:03:58.034
<v Speaker 2>that you're working towards even if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't understand what it is and that's </v>

1219
01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:03.440
<v Speaker 2>the thing that you can hold on to in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>darkness so to speak,</v>

1220
01:04:03.441 --> 01:04:04.070
<v Speaker 2>something you don't.</v>

1221
01:04:04.070 --> 01:04:06.870
<v Speaker 2>That's faith from the religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective and he might,</v>

1222
01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:07.510
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

1223
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:09.260
<v Speaker 2>I'll get to you right away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>

1224
01:04:09.261 --> 01:04:11.830
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's that faith in the answer to that?</v>

1225
01:04:11.831 --> 01:04:13.310
<v Speaker 2>And it's says possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1226
01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:17.020
<v Speaker 2>even if you don't know like this </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolutionary adaptation,</v>

1227
01:04:17.021 --> 01:04:19.190
<v Speaker 2>that's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what this morning represents.</v>

1228
01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:19.971
<v Speaker 2>You can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1229
01:04:19.971 --> 01:04:23.180
<v Speaker 2>this is an image of the hero from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mythological perspective to say,</v>

1230
01:04:23.181 --> 01:04:26.240
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may identify with that figure,</v>

1231
01:04:26.241 --> 01:04:29.360
<v Speaker 2>even if you don't know you're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to say that when you were here,</v>

1232
01:04:29.361 --> 01:04:31.250
<v Speaker 2>you may say to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1233
01:04:31.251 --> 01:04:35.540
<v Speaker 2>it's possible that if I pay attention </v>
<v Speaker 2>better things will come about.</v>

1234
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.823
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna say it's that what you're </v>

1235
01:04:37.551 --> 01:04:39.230
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you know when you're not,</v>

1236
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:43.730
<v Speaker 2>is identifying with the capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>undergo this process.</v>

1237
01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:45.710
<v Speaker 2>So then you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1238
01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:48.800
<v Speaker 2>even when you're in chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still have a story.</v>

1239
01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:49.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

1240
01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:51.200
<v Speaker 2>You do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you don't have to like people.</v>

1241
01:04:51.350 --> 01:04:52.183
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the problem with notions like </v>

1242
01:04:54.291 --> 01:04:55.580
<v Speaker 2>Joseph Campbell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

1243
01:04:55.581 --> 01:04:57.140
<v Speaker 2>Most new age philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>

1244
01:04:57.141 --> 01:04:58.070
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1245
01:04:58.220 --> 01:04:59.900
<v Speaker 2>follow your interests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1246
01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:00.913
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>normally wherever your interest take </v>

1247
01:05:02.151 --> 01:05:03.590
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's perfectly fine.</v>

1248
01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:05.180
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>follow your interest in.</v>

1249
01:05:05.181 --> 01:05:06.360
<v Speaker 2>You'll get to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1250
01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:07.930
<v Speaker 2>that's loaded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's uh,</v>

1251
01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:09.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you say?</v>

1252
01:05:09.310 --> 01:05:12.650
<v Speaker 2>A very over simplistic and naive </v>
<v Speaker 2>conception of development.</v>

1253
01:05:12.651 --> 01:05:15.530
<v Speaker 2>Because if you follow your interest and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you hit a big anomaly,</v>

1254
01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:17.890
<v Speaker 2>which you will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll end up here.</v>

1255
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:20.260
<v Speaker 2>And this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is by definition,</v>

1256
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:22.870
<v Speaker 2>the most unpleasant place that you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine to me.</v>

1257
01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:25.240
<v Speaker 2>And so it isn't just a matter of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1258
01:05:25.241 --> 01:05:27.610
<v Speaker 2>things are pretty damn good now and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just real good,</v>

1259
01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:31.450
<v Speaker 2>they'll get a lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's well things or you know,</v>

1260
01:05:31.451 --> 01:05:33.250
<v Speaker 2>however they are right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how that,</v>

1261
01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:35.500
<v Speaker 2>each person determines that personally.</v>

1262
01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:36.633
<v Speaker 2>And if you do what you should do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get a lot worse before </v>

1263
01:05:38.291 --> 01:05:40.120
<v Speaker 2>they get better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1264
01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:42.573
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of it because you need an </v>

1265
01:05:43.271 --> 01:05:44.220
<v Speaker 2>explanation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1266
01:05:44.250 --> 01:05:45.970
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't people do this?</v>

1267
01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:47.073
<v Speaker 2>Why don't people pay attention to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>normalcy information when it doesn't </v>

1268
01:05:49.931 --> 01:05:50.764
<v Speaker 2>take that much cognitive work to realize</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you ignore something that's </v>

1269
01:05:54.041 --> 01:05:54.874
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sooner or later it's going to cause you </v>

1270
01:05:56.591 --> 01:05:57.401
<v Speaker 2>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1271
01:05:57.401 --> 01:05:58.234
<v Speaker 2>why do people ignore it then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it must be a reason because some </v>

1272
01:06:00.911 --> 01:06:03.850
<v Speaker 2>interpretation is better than them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

1273
01:06:03.851 --> 01:06:05.260
<v Speaker 2>Even a bad one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

1274
01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:06.520
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1275
01:06:06.521 --> 01:06:09.970
<v Speaker 2>that explains a lot of the persistence </v>
<v Speaker 2>of forms of psychopathology.</v>

1276
01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:11.111
<v Speaker 2>So like you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1277
01:06:11.111 --> 01:06:12.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when someone has,</v>

1278
01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:13.053
<v Speaker 2>someone has a real cockeyed story and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's obvious to them that it's cockeyed </v>

1279
01:06:15.851 --> 01:06:16.684
<v Speaker 2>because their story transforms almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything into the determinant </v>

1280
01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:25.960
<v Speaker 2>significance is off anxiety and pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they'll still hang on to that like a</v>

1281
01:06:25.991 --> 01:06:26.824
<v Speaker 2>lifeline when you offer them an </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative story that would allow the </v>

1282
01:06:32.141 --> 01:06:35.910
<v Speaker 2>motivational states of hope and </v>
<v Speaker 2>satisfaction to emerge.</v>

1283
01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:40.630
<v Speaker 2>Because even though this is terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is worse,</v>

1284
01:06:41.850 --> 01:06:42.683
<v Speaker 5>I think it's at the new one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'd have to go there right now </v>

1285
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.880
<v Speaker 5>because they're not being a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they're escaping.</v>

1286
01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:51.780
<v Speaker 5>Escaping just perpetuates the anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if they're stuck in anxiety,</v>

1287
01:06:51.930 --> 01:06:52.860
<v Speaker 5>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then</v>

1288
01:06:53.070 --> 01:06:54.420
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well this is what,</v>

1289
01:06:54.421 --> 01:06:59.280
<v Speaker 2>this is why I want you to read paradise </v>
<v Speaker 2>lost because Milton's paradise lost is a</v>

1290
01:06:59.281 --> 01:07:01.070
<v Speaker 2>description of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of uh,</v>

1291
01:07:02.290 --> 01:07:03.123
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the feedback process that refusal to </v>

1292
01:07:06.121 --> 01:07:08.700
<v Speaker 2>admit to a normally necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>produces.</v>

1293
01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:10.063
<v Speaker 5>So question,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is there a qualitative difference or a </v>

1294
01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:16.100
<v Speaker 5>difference in the degree damage to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>branch?</v>

1295
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:20.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends on how you look at it.</v>

1296
01:07:20.151 --> 01:07:22.910
<v Speaker 2>Like though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at it from this perspective,</v>

1297
01:07:22.911 --> 01:07:25.140
<v Speaker 2>there's a qualitative difference because</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1298
01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:27.350
<v Speaker 2>damage to a branch would be damaged in </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1299
01:07:27.351 --> 01:07:30.650
<v Speaker 2>It's just a matter of means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the qualitative difference,</v>

1300
01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:33.080
<v Speaker 2>the qualitative shift would be damaged </v>
<v Speaker 2>here or here.</v>

1301
01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:36.590
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really quantitative.</v>

1302
01:07:37.550 --> 01:07:39.950
<v Speaker 2>And I think this is actually a more act </v>
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>

1303
01:07:39.970 --> 01:07:40.803
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Daniel Higgins helped me with </v>

1304
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.650
<v Speaker 2>substantial load developing this </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular representation by talk.</v>

1305
01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:49.100
<v Speaker 2>This makes it appear quantitative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then</v>

1306
01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:54.350
<v Speaker 2>the thing is you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say,</v>

1307
01:07:54.351 --> 01:07:56.270
<v Speaker 2>well maybe there's a qualitative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

1308
01:07:56.271 --> 01:07:59.270
<v Speaker 2>a quantitative difference between damage</v>
<v Speaker 2>here and here,</v>

1309
01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:00.493
<v Speaker 2>but there's a qualitative difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>between damage here and here because </v>

1310
01:08:04.610 --> 01:08:05.361
<v Speaker 2>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how I,</v>

1311
01:08:05.361 --> 01:08:06.650
<v Speaker 2>that's how I look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1312
01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:09.973
<v Speaker 2>it's a quantitative process that has the</v>
<v Speaker 2>appearance of qualitative shift from </v>

1313
01:08:14.511 --> 01:08:16.130
<v Speaker 2>time to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

1314
01:08:19.170 --> 01:08:24.170
<v Speaker 4>using this is a lot more</v>
<v Speaker 4>difficult to handle.</v>

1315
01:08:28.090 --> 01:08:31.950
<v Speaker 4>But I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm wondering why Maddie,</v>

1316
01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:36.880
<v Speaker 4>if I'm part of the leap of faith is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is</v>

1317
01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:45.540
<v Speaker 4>simply accepting that even if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand what you're doing,</v>

1318
01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:47.950
<v Speaker 4>you're doing it for something that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibilities,</v>

1319
01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:51.300
<v Speaker 4>it will still make you feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How exactly that</v>

1320
01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:53.750
<v Speaker 4>maybe fit in there.</v>

1321
01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:56.670
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>often pain is bounded.</v>

1322
01:08:57.210 --> 01:08:58.043
<v Speaker 6>So like let's say you're on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're operating under a system of </v>

1323
01:09:00.211 --> 01:09:03.780
<v Speaker 6>presumptions that always interferes with</v>
<v Speaker 6>your interpersonal relationships.</v>

1324
01:09:03.781 --> 01:09:06.720
<v Speaker 6>So they always end in catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's very predictable.</v>

1325
01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:08.033
<v Speaker 6>The point of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 6>remember the point of having a story is </v>

1326
01:09:09.691 --> 01:09:11.490
<v Speaker 6>to render things predictable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>

1327
01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:14.490
<v Speaker 6>predictable pain is a hell of a lot </v>
<v Speaker 6>better than unpredictable pain.</v>

1328
01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:18.540
<v Speaker 6>And it is possible depending on your </v>
<v Speaker 6>attitude towards anxiety,</v>

1329
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:19.703
<v Speaker 6>that predictable pain is better than </v>
<v Speaker 6>unpredictable pleasure because the </v>

1330
01:09:22.471 --> 01:09:25.740
<v Speaker 6>unpredictable aspect of the pleasure </v>
<v Speaker 6>means anxiety.</v>

1331
01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:28.080
<v Speaker 6>And then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether you,</v>

1332
01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:29.493
<v Speaker 6>whether where you would prefer anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 6>to pain in a sense depends on how you </v>

1333
01:09:34.411 --> 01:09:37.140
<v Speaker 6>construe your potential relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 6>anxiety.</v>

1334
01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:41.893
<v Speaker 4>Unpredictable.</v>

1335
01:09:52.330 --> 01:09:53.230
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1336
01:09:53.490 --> 01:09:54.323
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>

1337
01:09:58.610 --> 01:10:00.260
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's intermittent reinforcement.</v>

1338
01:10:00.261 --> 01:10:01.730
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's very hard to extinguish.</v>

1339
01:10:01.970 --> 01:10:03.890
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the thing about the thing about novelty,</v>

1340
01:10:03.891 --> 01:10:06.320
<v Speaker 6>this makes it complex,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that it's an intrinsically,</v>

1341
01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:10.310
<v Speaker 6>it's an intrinsically ambivalent </v>
<v Speaker 6>stimulus.</v>

1342
01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:13.150
<v Speaker 6>The thing is novel stimulus or not </v>
<v Speaker 6>really stimuli there,</v>

1343
01:10:13.210 --> 01:10:14.043
<v Speaker 6>their cloud,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there were a class of stimuli and they </v>

1344
01:10:15.681 --> 01:10:18.170
<v Speaker 6>produce both anxiety and incentive </v>
<v Speaker 6>reward.</v>

1345
01:10:18.171 --> 01:10:19.004
<v Speaker 6>So the circumstances of the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the gambling d determined in large </v>

1346
01:10:23.781 --> 01:10:24.614
<v Speaker 6>part,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like whether it's incentive reward or </v>

1347
01:10:26.301 --> 01:10:27.134
<v Speaker 6>anxiety that predominates and and that's</v>
<v Speaker 6>very situationally situationally </v>

1348
01:10:30.861 --> 01:10:32.900
<v Speaker 6>dependent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So in the case of gambling,</v>

1349
01:10:32.901 --> 01:10:36.080
<v Speaker 6>this situation is set up so that at </v>
<v Speaker 6>least for those who gamble,</v>

1350
01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:39.020
<v Speaker 6>the incentive reward outweighs the </v>
<v Speaker 6>anxiety.</v>

1351
01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:42.020
<v Speaker 6>But they both produce it while a </v>
<v Speaker 6>heightened state of arousal,</v>

1352
01:10:42.021 --> 01:10:44.840
<v Speaker 6>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But lots of people won't gamble too.</v>

1353
01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:45.733
<v Speaker 6>So that that would,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that would have something to do partly </v>

1354
01:10:47.391 --> 01:10:50.180
<v Speaker 6>with scheme of interpretation and partly</v>
<v Speaker 6>with biological differences.</v>

1355
01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:51.273
<v Speaker 6>So similar,</v>

1356
01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:57.150
<v Speaker 7>it seems it biologically that we respond</v>
<v Speaker 7>more to it than to actual reward.</v>

1357
01:10:57.380 --> 01:10:59.300
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that you can make an argument to</v>

1358
01:10:59.301 --> 01:11:00.134
<v Speaker 6>that end.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1359
01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:03.600
<v Speaker 7>So would you say the same thing then for</v>
<v Speaker 7>threat and anxiety versus punishment?</v>

1360
01:11:04.730 --> 01:11:07.190
<v Speaker 6>What would you say like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

1361
01:11:07.191 --> 01:11:11.780
<v Speaker 6>it's a lot easier for us to adapt to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to the fact of punishments.</v>

1362
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:14.850
<v Speaker 6>We just eliminate them like very rare </v>
<v Speaker 6>that any of us are in pain,</v>

1363
01:11:14.970 --> 01:11:16.830
<v Speaker 6>but it's not rare at all that were </v>
<v Speaker 6>anxious.</v>

1364
01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:18.810
<v Speaker 6>We haven't been able to do much about </v>
<v Speaker 6>that at all.</v>

1365
01:11:19.050 --> 01:11:21.750
<v Speaker 6>Partly because there's the existential </v>
<v Speaker 6>aspect of anxiety,</v>

1366
01:11:21.751 --> 01:11:22.584
<v Speaker 6>but whether,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether anxiety is more motivating than </v>

1367
01:11:24.901 --> 01:11:28.410
<v Speaker 6>pain is kind of a moot point because </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's situationally dependent.</v>

1368
01:11:28.411 --> 01:11:29.244
<v Speaker 6>But it is certainly more difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 6>rid ourselves of anxiety on any </v>

1369
01:11:32.971 --> 01:11:35.610
<v Speaker 6>permanent basis.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So for,</v>

1370
01:11:35.611 --> 01:11:36.444
<v Speaker 6>for,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for people who have already solved the </v>

1371
01:11:38.671 --> 01:11:39.504
<v Speaker 6>problem of subjugation to pain and also </v>
<v Speaker 6>the problem of most basic satisfactions </v>

1372
01:11:44.101 --> 01:11:45.810
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that that's the case in our culture,</v>

1373
01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:48.720
<v Speaker 6>we're still very much governed and </v>
<v Speaker 6>almost entirely governed,</v>

1374
01:11:48.721 --> 01:11:52.290
<v Speaker 6>I think by anxiety and incentive reward.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So</v>

1375
01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:54.703
<v Speaker 6>there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's funny because there are secondary </v>

1376
01:11:55.891 --> 01:11:58.580
<v Speaker 6>reinforcers so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're in some,</v>

1377
01:11:58.650 --> 01:11:59.483
<v Speaker 6>in many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 6>more fundamental than the primary </v>

1378
01:12:00.961 --> 01:12:01.800
<v Speaker 6>reinforcers.</v>

1379
01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:06.590
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to go back and forth on for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>second because I was thinking about this</v>

1380
01:12:06.591 --> 01:12:07.424
<v Speaker 2>the other day and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a board of them just doesn't make sense </v>

1381
01:12:10.731 --> 01:12:15.731
<v Speaker 2>to me except in terms of not moving </v>
<v Speaker 2>toward some goal or rather,</v>

1382
01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:18.830
<v Speaker 2>because I was just thinking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

1383
01:12:18.831 --> 01:12:19.664
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1384
01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:20.513
<v Speaker 2>important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boredom is essentially results from </v>

1385
01:12:22.611 --> 01:12:23.444
<v Speaker 2>being in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1386
01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:27.620
<v Speaker 2>in monotonous situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if,</v>

1387
01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:30.980
<v Speaker 2>if in that situation you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't have any,</v>

1388
01:12:30.981 --> 01:12:31.814
<v Speaker 2>you didn't have any other goals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be perfectly happy just sitting </v>

1389
01:12:33.471 --> 01:12:34.420
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was just thinking if,</v>

1390
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:35.690
<v Speaker 2>if I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm just sitting around,</v>

1391
01:12:35.691 --> 01:12:37.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm sitting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sitting alone in a room,</v>

1392
01:12:37.521 --> 01:12:38.354
<v Speaker 2>in a chair with nothing going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all only if that doesn't conflict </v>

1393
01:12:42.381 --> 01:12:43.214
<v Speaker 2>with some other drive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to go get food or something more </v>

1394
01:12:45.051 --> 01:12:46.810
<v Speaker 2>complex or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

1395
01:12:47.630 --> 01:12:50.030
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but only if it conflicts with some other</v>

1396
01:12:50.031 --> 01:12:51.830
<v Speaker 2>drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I going to be unhappy sitting there?</v>

1397
01:12:52.190 --> 01:12:54.030
<v Speaker 2>Am I going to feel what people refer to </v>
<v Speaker 2>as boredom.</v>

1398
01:12:54.910 --> 01:12:55.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1399
01:12:55.610 --> 01:12:56.443
<v Speaker 2>Because otherwise if I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I don't want anything in particular </v>

1400
01:12:58.941 --> 01:12:59.774
<v Speaker 2>at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be perfectly happy just sitting </v>

1401
01:13:00.441 --> 01:13:01.340
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1402
01:13:01.341 --> 01:13:02.174
<v Speaker 2>if it doesn't conflict with some </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement toward whatever ideal future I </v>

1403
01:13:06.801 --> 01:13:09.320
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be,</v>

1404
01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:11.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be bored per se.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1405
01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:12.753
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1406
01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:17.520
<v Speaker 6>Well here we are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

1407
01:13:17.610 --> 01:13:19.290
<v Speaker 6>we do seek out novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>

1408
01:13:19.291 --> 01:13:21.570
<v Speaker 6>And that's partly because,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1409
01:13:21.571 --> 01:13:23.850
<v Speaker 6>it ties back with what I was describing </v>
<v Speaker 6>earlier,</v>

1410
01:13:23.851 --> 01:13:26.040
<v Speaker 6>is that if you have nothing better to </v>
<v Speaker 6>do,</v>

1411
01:13:26.130 --> 01:13:29.220
<v Speaker 6>seeking out some more information is </v>
<v Speaker 6>useful per se.</v>

1412
01:13:29.630 --> 01:13:32.790
<v Speaker 6>So not only for any goal that you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that you actually have,</v>

1413
01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:35.340
<v Speaker 6>but for all conceivable goals that you </v>
<v Speaker 6>could have.</v>

1414
01:13:35.730 --> 01:13:38.220
<v Speaker 6>So if you're sitting around doing </v>
<v Speaker 6>nothing,</v>

1415
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:39.383
<v Speaker 6>then that's worse in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then doing something new and generating </v>

1416
01:13:44.131 --> 01:13:44.964
<v Speaker 6>new information on there was one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the most metal drives is simply </v>

1417
01:13:47.551 --> 01:13:48.384
<v Speaker 6>to look for novelty so that maybe you'd </v>
<v Speaker 6>be able to take sitting around for a </v>

1418
01:13:50.641 --> 01:13:52.230
<v Speaker 6>while because I drive hasn't really </v>
<v Speaker 6>kicked in,</v>

1419
01:13:52.231 --> 01:13:53.064
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>eventually door because you need a rest </v>

1420
01:13:54.550 --> 01:13:55.383
<v Speaker 6>or eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but eventually you get restless and </v>

1421
01:13:56.701 --> 01:13:58.050
<v Speaker 6>you'll go cruising around even if it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>not,</v>

1422
01:13:58.051 --> 01:13:58.884
<v Speaker 6>even if it's aimless,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even if you have nothing particularly I </v>

1423
01:14:00.341 --> 01:14:02.020
<v Speaker 6>did do just simply because of that </v>
<v Speaker 6>drive.</v>

1424
01:14:02.021 --> 01:14:04.590
<v Speaker 6>Is there just to cause trouble leaving </v>
<v Speaker 6>often?</v>

1425
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:07.783
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1426
01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:08.670
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's to produce,</v>

1427
01:14:08.730 --> 01:14:10.680
<v Speaker 6>well actually it's to produce new </v>
<v Speaker 6>information,</v>

1428
01:14:10.681 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 6>I guess you could say.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That would be the,</v>

1429
01:14:12.510 --> 01:14:14.050
<v Speaker 6>that's kind of the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the final,</v>

1430
01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:19.810
<v Speaker 6>that's the final explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you will feed on information,</v>

1431
01:14:20.970 --> 01:14:21.970
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just like food.</v>

1432
01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:24.850
<v Speaker 6>So it's not so much a question of not </v>
<v Speaker 6>being bored is how long you can,</v>

1433
01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:28.060
<v Speaker 6>you can wait before you get bored </v>
<v Speaker 6>because you will necessarily,</v>

1434
01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:30.730
<v Speaker 6>and there seems to be individual </v>
<v Speaker 6>differences in that too.</v>

1435
01:14:30.910 --> 01:14:35.270
<v Speaker 6>But novelty,</v>
<v Speaker 6>novelty is very motivating and uh,</v>

1436
01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:37.330
<v Speaker 6>well it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's also anxiety provoking,</v>

1437
01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:38.500
<v Speaker 6>so.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1438
01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:41.860
<v Speaker 6>Are there other issues or,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1439
01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:45.230
<v Speaker 8>if I had,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if I asked you what was the ideal future</v>

1440
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:46.183
<v Speaker 8>in the middle of the last century,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you might have said that the ideal </v>

1441
01:14:49.131 --> 01:14:52.820
<v Speaker 8>future at the cultural level,</v>
<v Speaker 8>one that was that uh,</v>

1442
01:14:53.290 --> 01:14:56.090
<v Speaker 8>the trunk of the tree,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the all encompassing,</v>

1443
01:14:57.330 --> 01:15:00.670
<v Speaker 8>the ideal future of that story.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The answer might have been that it would</v>

1444
01:15:00.671 --> 01:15:05.390
<v Speaker 8>have been identification with Christ</v>
<v Speaker 8>or else it would have been</v>

1445
01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:11.000
<v Speaker 8>getting to the new Jerusalem.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Both of them seem,</v>

1446
01:15:11.410 --> 01:15:16.410
<v Speaker 8>and the first one is</v>
<v Speaker 8>the identification with Christ is the,</v>

1447
01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:18.583
<v Speaker 8>the ideal as the way and the new </v>
<v Speaker 8>Jerusalem would be a ideal as a static </v>

1448
01:15:25.371 --> 01:15:26.240
<v Speaker 8>state,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which may,</v>

1449
01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:31.640
<v Speaker 8>which may be prolonged over time.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And I came across,</v>

1450
01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:33.410
<v Speaker 8>I came onto this cause I was wondering </v>
<v Speaker 8>what,</v>

1451
01:15:33.411 --> 01:15:34.244
<v Speaker 8>what,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what's the implications for the ideal </v>

1452
01:15:35.631 --> 01:15:36.464
<v Speaker 8>future if you throw away the five </v>
<v Speaker 8>unconditioned stimuli as the </v>

1453
01:15:39.981 --> 01:15:43.070
<v Speaker 8>unconditioned stimuli,</v>
<v Speaker 8>because the new Jerusalem is the,</v>

1454
01:15:43.071 --> 01:15:44.960
<v Speaker 8>is the five unconditioned stimuli</v>

1455
01:15:45.770 --> 01:15:48.040
<v Speaker 6>optimally dealt with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>always</v>

1456
01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:49.660
<v Speaker 8>taken care of.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Whereas the,</v>

1457
01:15:49.661 --> 01:15:52.210
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the Christ is,</v>

1458
01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:54.700
<v Speaker 8>well that's a different one.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's,</v>

1459
01:15:54.730 --> 01:15:57.850
<v Speaker 8>that's a more sophisticated ideal </v>
<v Speaker 8>future.</v>

1460
01:15:58.750 --> 01:16:03.750
<v Speaker 8>So</v>
<v Speaker 8>what is the ideal future then,</v>

1461
01:16:04.930 --> 01:16:06.590
<v Speaker 8>are there to decide?</v>

1462
01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:08.830
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's,</v>

1463
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:11.900
<v Speaker 6>it's still a reasonable way of </v>
<v Speaker 6>conceptualizing things mean you can look</v>

1464
01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:13.940
<v Speaker 6>at it from a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>within the system perspective,</v>

1465
01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:14.893
<v Speaker 6>because there's a anthropological terms </v>
<v Speaker 6>for this that I always forget and make </v>

1466
01:16:17.481 --> 01:16:18.314
<v Speaker 6>an EP ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One means or within the system </v>

1467
01:16:20.421 --> 01:16:21.254
<v Speaker 6>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the other means that between the </v>

1468
01:16:22.161 --> 01:16:26.090
<v Speaker 6>system perspective and a</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1469
01:16:26.091 --> 01:16:26.924
<v Speaker 6>so that you can construe your ideals </v>
<v Speaker 6>either from within the confines of a </v>

1470
01:16:29.991 --> 01:16:30.824
<v Speaker 6>particular story,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you accept the story or you can </v>

1471
01:16:32.361 --> 01:16:33.194
<v Speaker 6>construe it in terms of always being </v>
<v Speaker 6>able to update the story if necessary </v>

1472
01:16:35.661 --> 01:16:36.340
<v Speaker 6>with the story.</v>

1473
01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:38.730
<v Speaker 8>This identification with Christ as the </v>
<v Speaker 8>ideal future.</v>

1474
01:16:38.731 --> 01:16:40.770
<v Speaker 8>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>is not surrounded by chaos.</v>

1475
01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:42.361
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1476
01:16:42.361 --> 01:16:43.370
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's not exactly,</v>

1477
01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:44.430
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1478
01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:45.433
<v Speaker 6>that's a complicated issue.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's surrounded by belief in the </v>

1479
01:16:47.451 --> 01:16:50.660
<v Speaker 6>capacity to deal with chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If it arises in a sense that's what gets</v>

1480
01:16:50.661 --> 01:16:51.494
<v Speaker 6>rid of it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or at least gets rid of the negative </v>

1481
01:16:52.791 --> 01:16:56.750
<v Speaker 6>aspect of it so it doesn't eliminate it </v>
<v Speaker 6>permanently.</v>

1482
01:16:56.751 --> 01:17:00.080
<v Speaker 6>It just transforms it in a sense into </v>
<v Speaker 6>something that can always be dealt with.</v>

1483
01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:03.830
<v Speaker 8>It's internal,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so if you draw,</v>

1484
01:17:03.850 --> 01:17:04.683
<v Speaker 8>if you the story,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you construct the story with </v>

1485
01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:10.160
<v Speaker 8>identification with Christ as the ideal </v>
<v Speaker 8>of future and you put a circle around</v>

1486
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:11.840
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos is inside the circle.</v>

1487
01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:14.151
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1488
01:17:14.151 --> 01:17:15.800
<v Speaker 2>I see what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1489
01:17:15.801 --> 01:17:16.431
<v Speaker 2>well that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1490
01:17:16.431 --> 01:17:17.280
<v Speaker 2>that's a good point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan.</v>

1491
01:17:17.281 --> 01:17:17.631
<v Speaker 2>Danielle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1492
01:17:17.631 --> 01:17:19.510
<v Speaker 2>that has to do with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1493
01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:22.890
<v Speaker 2>that has to do with put that whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>scheme that if you were,</v>

1494
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:25.500
<v Speaker 2>if you can taste this as your model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's your take Christ Cynthia,</v>

1495
01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:27.980
<v Speaker 2>ideal future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then that would put that,</v>

1496
01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:30.970
<v Speaker 2>that whole diagram in yet another </v>
<v Speaker 2>diagram.</v>

1497
01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:32.453
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1498
01:17:32.530 --> 01:17:33.520
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1499
01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:34.460
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

1500
01:17:34.490 --> 01:17:35.510
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hang on a second.</v>

1501
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:37.303
<v Speaker 2>First of all with regards to board of </v>
<v Speaker 2>which we talked about earlier is the </v>

1502
01:17:40.521 --> 01:17:42.380
<v Speaker 2>thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that we know that that,</v>

1503
01:17:42.850 --> 01:17:43.683
<v Speaker 2>that the problem with a perfect static </v>
<v Speaker 2>state is that there's no novelty and </v>

1504
01:17:46.851 --> 01:17:49.820
<v Speaker 2>that's a problem because all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>incentive reward disappears.</v>

1505
01:17:50.150 --> 01:17:50.983
<v Speaker 2>But if you want novelty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you will then you necessarily take </v>

1506
01:17:53.451 --> 01:17:55.370
<v Speaker 2>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could say,</v>

1507
01:17:55.371 --> 01:17:56.690
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's part of the argument.</v>

1508
01:17:56.691 --> 01:17:57.524
<v Speaker 2>Then the other idea here is in part how </v>
<v Speaker 2>do you deal in the final analysis with </v>

1509
01:18:01.881 --> 01:18:03.800
<v Speaker 2>the fact that there are normalist events</v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

1510
01:18:03.801 --> 01:18:06.230
<v Speaker 2>which you can't adapt like death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1511
01:18:06.231 --> 01:18:07.190
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1512
01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:11.930
<v Speaker 2>the point that you're driving out in </v>
<v Speaker 2>park is that if you got,</v>

1513
01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:13.143
<v Speaker 2>if you think about</v>

1514
01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:15.893
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

1515
01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:23.500
<v Speaker 2>one way of looking at the ideal future </v>
<v Speaker 2>is it's a place where there is no chaos,</v>

1516
01:18:24.010 --> 01:18:25.900
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means it's permanently eliminated.</v>

1517
01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:27.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's predictable.</v>

1518
01:18:27.971 --> 01:18:30.460
<v Speaker 2>Everything is random,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unpredictable and theoretically perfect.</v>

1519
01:18:31.090 --> 01:18:32.680
<v Speaker 2>The other way of looking at it just to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1520
01:18:32.681 --> 01:18:33.514
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that wouldn't be perfect for </v>

1521
01:18:35.201 --> 01:18:36.550
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For things to be perfect,</v>

1522
01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:40.480
<v Speaker 2>there has to be some chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So on the chaos might be the type,</v>

1523
01:18:40.481 --> 01:18:44.560
<v Speaker 2>for example of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the anomalies that we can't solve.</v>

1524
01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:45.573
<v Speaker 2>So then the ideal type of adaptation </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be the construction of a mode of </v>

1525
01:18:50.141 --> 01:18:53.950
<v Speaker 2>being in which the fact that there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>permanent anomalies,</v>

1526
01:18:53.951 --> 01:18:57.520
<v Speaker 2>even a very terrifying sort of makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense and is acceptable.</v>

1527
01:18:58.090 --> 01:19:00.250
<v Speaker 2>So hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's again,</v>

1528
01:19:00.251 --> 01:19:01.084
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of what we want to drive </v>

1529
01:19:02.531 --> 01:19:05.980
<v Speaker 2>that in this course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean people find with regards to being</v>

1530
01:19:05.981 --> 01:19:06.814
<v Speaker 2>twisted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people find the fact that very unfair </v>

1531
01:19:09.401 --> 01:19:10.234
<v Speaker 2>and threatening and hurtful things </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly happen and that turns them </v>

1532
01:19:12.551 --> 01:19:17.110
<v Speaker 2>against life because they think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there can be no possible story,</v>

1533
01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:18.333
<v Speaker 2>there can be no possible justification </v>
<v Speaker 2>in which that category of events can </v>

1534
01:19:21.941 --> 01:19:22.774
<v Speaker 2>attain an acceptable determinant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meaning therefore life is cruel and </v>

1535
01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:27.663
<v Speaker 2>unreal and unreasonable in its intrinsic</v>
<v Speaker 2>aspects and deserves spot under those </v>

1536
01:19:31.871 --> 01:19:33.640
<v Speaker 2>conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can take revenge against it,</v>

1537
01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:34.773
<v Speaker 2>which I think is what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a non simplistic explanation for </v>

1538
01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:40.600
<v Speaker 2>anti social behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because as psychologists,</v>

1539
01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:42.220
<v Speaker 2>we tend to think about these social </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1540
01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:44.290
<v Speaker 2>they like novelty and they like to break</v>
<v Speaker 2>rules,</v>

1541
01:19:44.291 --> 01:19:45.124
<v Speaker 2>but we never really get at the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like very hostile and very </v>

1542
01:19:47.801 --> 01:19:50.440
<v Speaker 2>revengeful and they like hurting other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and so on.</v>

1543
01:19:50.441 --> 01:19:53.680
<v Speaker 2>Because we don't know how to understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>that category of emotions say</v>

1544
01:19:55.170 --> 01:19:56.003
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to start that sort of thing from </v>

1545
01:19:57.031 --> 01:19:59.010
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need a story that says,</v>

1546
01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:00.151
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1547
01:20:00.151 --> 01:20:00.984
<v Speaker 2>unreasonable things always happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in some sense they're absolutely </v>

1548
01:20:04.831 --> 01:20:05.664
<v Speaker 2>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what a story that's believable so </v>

1549
01:20:09.121 --> 01:20:11.280
<v Speaker 2>that their effect of valence has </v>
<v Speaker 2>shifted.</v>

1550
01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:12.533
<v Speaker 2>So we'll talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this section later in this </v>

1551
01:20:14.131 --> 01:20:14.964
<v Speaker 2>manuscript that talks about I then </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a section in the grand </v>

1552
01:20:17.731 --> 01:20:20.700
<v Speaker 2>inquisitor or in the brothers Karamazov </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ivan,</v>

1553
01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:21.773
<v Speaker 2>who's an atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is talking to his younger brother </v>

1554
01:20:23.581 --> 01:20:24.680
<v Speaker 2>Alicia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who wants to be,</v>

1555
01:20:24.681 --> 01:20:25.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1556
01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:30.480
<v Speaker 2>who's st like it wants to be a priest </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Ivan as a committed atheist.</v>

1557
01:20:30.481 --> 01:20:31.314
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he tells a bunch of stories about </v>

1558
01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:35.960
<v Speaker 2>torture of children in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Russia at the turn of the century.</v>

1559
01:20:35.970 --> 01:20:37.230
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm world,</v>

1560
01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:39.210
<v Speaker 2>like there can be no god in the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this.</v>

1561
01:20:39.211 --> 01:20:42.000
<v Speaker 2>And basically what he's saying is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look around you,</v>

1562
01:20:42.001 --> 01:20:42.834
<v Speaker 2>the valence of things is such to </v>
<v Speaker 2>demonstrate unequivocally that things </v>

1563
01:20:45.721 --> 01:20:48.090
<v Speaker 2>are meaningless in the final analysis.</v>

1564
01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:49.343
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1565
01:20:49.410 --> 01:20:52.980
<v Speaker 2>some people regard that that particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>section of the brothers Karamazov is the</v>

1566
01:20:52.981 --> 01:20:56.970
<v Speaker 2>most potent argument for atheism that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever been constructed.</v>

1567
01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:58.343
<v Speaker 2>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the kind of argument that you </v>

1568
01:20:59.611 --> 01:21:02.850
<v Speaker 2>have to address if you want to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomena that twist people up.</v>

1569
01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:04.273
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you beat someone and torture them </v>

1570
01:21:05.371 --> 01:21:07.680
<v Speaker 2>when they're a child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that surprising that they might</v>

1571
01:21:07.681 --> 01:21:08.514
<v Speaker 2>turn against the world in regard to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that should be obliterated so </v>

1572
01:21:12.190 --> 01:21:12.710
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1573
01:21:12.710 --> 01:21:13.543
<v Speaker 2>that might be the moral thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you need a story that can address </v>

1574
01:21:15.781 --> 01:21:17.280
<v Speaker 2>those sorts of possibilities.</v>

1575
01:21:17.690 --> 01:21:18.523
<v Speaker 8>So are you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>would it be fair then to say the pure </v>

1576
01:21:20.661 --> 01:21:24.380
<v Speaker 8>asking us to,</v>
<v Speaker 8>to modify our current state,</v>

1577
01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:26.790
<v Speaker 8>our current view of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

1578
01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:32.200
<v Speaker 8>from one where we will do absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 8>anything to avoid chaos into some,</v>

1579
01:21:32.630 --> 01:21:35.660
<v Speaker 8>into one where we posit an ideal future </v>
<v Speaker 8>which has,</v>

1580
01:21:36.260 --> 01:21:38.450
<v Speaker 8>right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We'll do as the anything to avoid</v>

1581
01:21:39.050 --> 01:21:42.110
<v Speaker 2>as a necessary constituent element of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and can hopefully,</v>

1582
01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:46.490
<v Speaker 2>and hopefully also that you will come to</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand from the rational perspective</v>

1583
01:21:46.610 --> 01:21:47.443
<v Speaker 2>why the existence of that is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>precondition for the fact that there is </v>

1584
01:21:50.031 --> 01:21:51.680
<v Speaker 2>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's the,</v>

1585
01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:53.053
<v Speaker 2>that's another thing that these </v>
<v Speaker 2>mythological stories are very good at </v>

1586
01:21:54.891 --> 01:21:55.724
<v Speaker 2>outlining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say the cosmos is actually </v>

1587
01:21:57.321 --> 01:22:00.590
<v Speaker 2>constructed of the division between </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos and order.</v>

1588
01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:01.573
<v Speaker 2>If you obliterate that dividing line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then everything returns to this </v>

1589
01:22:04.521 --> 01:22:07.940
<v Speaker 2>hypothetical state of no one being in </v>
<v Speaker 2>which there is no pain,</v>

1590
01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:10.370
<v Speaker 2>but there's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing.</v>

1591
01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.120
<v Speaker 2>So then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the fact that there is something,</v>

1592
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:19.870
<v Speaker 2>despite all its negative motivation will</v>
<v Speaker 2>implications preferable to nothing?</v>

1593
01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:21.620
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

1594
01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:22.663
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Khumbu didn't come who </v>
<v Speaker 2>say that the only question worth </v>

1595
01:22:24.471 --> 01:22:26.540
<v Speaker 2>considering is whether or not to commit </v>
<v Speaker 2>suicide?</v>

1596
01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:29.840
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the same question is,</v>

1597
01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:30.793
<v Speaker 2>is life in with its intrinsic </v>
<v Speaker 2>limitations preferable to a state where </v>

1598
01:22:34.521 --> 01:22:36.350
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>

1599
01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:39.110
<v Speaker 2>that is the bottom line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the bottom line question.</v>

1600
01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:43.650
<v Speaker 7>So I'd like to address this because I've</v>
<v Speaker 7>been listening for the past hour or two.</v>

1601
01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:47.090
<v Speaker 7>It seems like a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 7>many attempts to,</v>

1602
01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:48.943
<v Speaker 7>to reconcile an ideal future would just </v>
<v Speaker 7>like a utopia perfect society or on Fox </v>

1603
01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:57.340
<v Speaker 7>and static sense.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If I just sit in the chair,</v>

1604
01:22:57.370 --> 01:22:59.840
<v Speaker 7>when will I get bored with an ideal </v>
<v Speaker 7>life,</v>

1605
01:23:00.170 --> 01:23:03.530
<v Speaker 7>which is identification process or </v>
<v Speaker 7>identification with Christ,</v>

1606
01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:05.920
<v Speaker 7>which is not the same thing as ideal </v>
<v Speaker 7>society.</v>

1607
01:23:06.230 --> 01:23:07.063
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And somehow that those are not the same </v>

1608
01:23:09.281 --> 01:23:10.170
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1609
01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:11.013
<v Speaker 4>But that's what I hear people trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do is to make an ideal society the same </v>

1610
01:23:15.221 --> 01:23:16.110
<v Speaker 4>thing as an ideal life.</v>

1611
01:23:16.260 --> 01:23:18.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people constantly confuse the state with</v>

1612
01:23:18.871 --> 01:23:21.330
<v Speaker 2>the process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is also true as we'll see with,</v>

1613
01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:26.750
<v Speaker 2>with regards to conceptualizations of </v>
<v Speaker 2>evil because people presume that evil is</v>

1614
01:23:27.421 --> 01:23:28.254
<v Speaker 2>a state rather than a process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the state might be aggression or </v>

1615
01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:33.173
<v Speaker 2>cruelty or jealousy or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can list a whole bunch of </v>

1616
01:23:35.701 --> 01:23:39.870
<v Speaker 2>motivational states that people tend to </v>
<v Speaker 2>value negatively.</v>

1617
01:23:39.871 --> 01:23:40.704
<v Speaker 2>So I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1618
01:23:41.190 --> 01:23:42.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1619
01:23:42.270 --> 01:23:43.103
<v Speaker 2>people fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people produce social conflict because </v>

1620
01:23:46.561 --> 01:23:47.394
<v Speaker 2>they're aggressive and therefore if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can socialize boys in particular to not </v>

1621
01:23:51.541 --> 01:23:54.930
<v Speaker 2>be aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the capacity for war we'll vantage,</v>

1622
01:23:54.990 --> 01:23:57.780
<v Speaker 2>which I think is like truly an idiotic </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>

1623
01:23:58.170 --> 01:24:02.100
<v Speaker 2>But that's what happens when you confuse</v>
<v Speaker 2>the process of evil with,</v>

1624
01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:03.490
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with uh,</v>

1625
01:24:03.870 --> 01:24:05.820
<v Speaker 2>what you make an idol of evil </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental.</v>

1626
01:24:05.821 --> 01:24:06.301
<v Speaker 2>And we say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1627
01:24:06.301 --> 01:24:09.480
<v Speaker 2>it can be identified as this set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomena,</v>

1628
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:11.400
<v Speaker 2>which basically turns it into an idol.</v>

1629
01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:12.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just as bad.</v>

1630
01:24:13.290 --> 01:24:17.890
<v Speaker 2>It's just as significant a philosophical</v>
<v Speaker 2>error as doing the same thing to good.</v>

1631
01:24:17.891 --> 01:24:19.650
<v Speaker 2>And the reverse saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1632
01:24:19.890 --> 01:24:20.723
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pieces good or happiness is good or </v>

1633
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:24.630
<v Speaker 2>contentment is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

1634
01:24:24.631 --> 01:24:27.840
<v Speaker 2>those are all context dependent </v>
<v Speaker 2>evaluations.</v>

1635
01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:30.450
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes happiness is very bad so to </v>
<v Speaker 2>speak.</v>

1636
01:24:30.451 --> 01:24:33.000
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're experiencing it well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1637
01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:36.450
<v Speaker 2>torturing someone else for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is certainly a possibility.</v>

1638
01:24:36.810 --> 01:24:37.643
<v Speaker 2>So what we'll come to at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lectures is a Mrs Taletha had slightly </v>

1639
01:24:42.961 --> 01:24:44.880
<v Speaker 2>as a conceptualization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well if,</v>

1640
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.950
<v Speaker 2>if the conceptualization of good is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity to admit to the existence of an</v>

1641
01:24:49.951 --> 01:24:53.730
<v Speaker 2>anomaly when it manifests itself and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then to act accordingly,</v>

1642
01:24:54.060 --> 01:24:56.460
<v Speaker 2>then evil is the precise opposite of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1643
01:24:56.461 --> 01:24:57.294
<v Speaker 2>which is not aggression or hostility or </v>
<v Speaker 2>jealousy or anything that people </v>

1644
01:25:00.781 --> 01:25:01.614
<v Speaker 2>normally sort of label evil but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the process of refusing to admit </v>

1645
01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:10.410
<v Speaker 2>that something has changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and you can say,</v>

1646
01:25:10.411 --> 01:25:11.244
<v Speaker 2>well that leads to aggression in </v>
<v Speaker 2>situations where it might not be </v>

1647
01:25:13.141 --> 01:25:15.360
<v Speaker 2>desirable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it leads to hostility and so fine,</v>

1648
01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:17.140
<v Speaker 2>but it's still a process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a,</v>

1649
01:25:17.730 --> 01:25:21.150
<v Speaker 2>not a state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So question</v>

1650
01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:28.400
<v Speaker 4>to the limitations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but actually not</v>

1651
01:25:39.780 --> 01:25:44.780
<v Speaker 4>concerning it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and still have something attractive.</v>

1652
01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:48.630
<v Speaker 2>That's why they like you see this in </v>
<v Speaker 2>American movies very,</v>

1653
01:25:48.631 --> 01:25:50.700
<v Speaker 2>very often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the anti hero,</v>

1654
01:25:50.701 --> 01:25:53.280
<v Speaker 2>the gangster for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is actually viewed as a hero.</v>

1655
01:25:53.610 --> 01:25:56.220
<v Speaker 2>Although his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his paths of action produce well,</v>

1656
01:25:56.221 --> 01:25:58.290
<v Speaker 2>disruption and chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's still something very,</v>

1657
01:25:58.291 --> 01:26:01.310
<v Speaker 2>very attractive about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

1658
01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:04.240
<v Speaker 2>that's one example of that as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1659
01:26:04.730 --> 01:26:05.563
<v Speaker 2>It's also the case that the agent that </v>
<v Speaker 2>produces the disruption of this system </v>

1660
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.120
<v Speaker 2>can be viewed as something positive from</v>
<v Speaker 2>this perspective,</v>

1661
01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:17.030
<v Speaker 2>but as something entirely negative from </v>
<v Speaker 2>within here,</v>

1662
01:26:17.210 --> 01:26:18.650
<v Speaker 2>which is part of the reason you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1663
01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:21.800
<v Speaker 2>people don't like geniuses very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example in science,</v>

1664
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:22.160
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1665
01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:22.993
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of resistance to truly </v>

1666
01:26:24.861 --> 01:26:28.520
<v Speaker 2>novel theoretical formulations to truly </v>
<v Speaker 2>creative activity.</v>

1667
01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:29.653
<v Speaker 2>Well that we all presume like if we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>evaluating how those in the past </v>

1668
01:26:34.791 --> 01:26:35.624
<v Speaker 2>responded to creative genius,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say like the Catholic priesthood </v>

1669
01:26:38.031 --> 01:26:38.864
<v Speaker 2>responding to Galileo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we always make the presumption that we </v>

1670
01:26:41.181 --> 01:26:42.014
<v Speaker 2>would have been on Galileo side had we </v>
<v Speaker 2>been there because viewing the past we </v>

1671
01:26:44.601 --> 01:26:46.150
<v Speaker 2>can take sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1672
01:26:46.450 --> 01:26:47.750
<v Speaker 2>a higher order view point.</v>

1673
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:48.583
<v Speaker 2>But the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that for the Catholic priests who </v>

1674
01:26:50.451 --> 01:26:53.030
<v Speaker 2>were stuck in this story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Galileo's discovery was the,</v>

1675
01:26:53.031 --> 01:26:56.780
<v Speaker 2>normally at the highest order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it had catastrophic consequences.</v>

1676
01:26:56.990 --> 01:26:57.823
<v Speaker 2>I think that's improper primarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they actually misunderstood the </v>

1677
01:27:00.891 --> 01:27:03.410
<v Speaker 2>import of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the information.</v>

1678
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:04.303
<v Speaker 2>But still from in here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Galileo looked like an agent of the </v>

1679
01:27:07.101 --> 01:27:08.390
<v Speaker 2>devil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we would say,</v>

1680
01:27:08.391 --> 01:27:09.110
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1681
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:09.943
<v Speaker 2>in actuality he was providing the kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of anomalous information that leads to </v>

1682
01:27:15.321 --> 01:27:16.800
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1683
01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:20.110
<v Speaker 2>I think at least in part thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1684
01:27:20.111 --> 01:27:20.944
<v Speaker 2>this is that the excesses of the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 2>Union could be regarded as the </v>

1685
01:27:25.451 --> 01:27:26.284
<v Speaker 2>inevitable historical consequence of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>process that Galileo set into motion </v>

1686
01:27:30.670 --> 01:27:33.970
<v Speaker 2>because the Russians lost their Orthodox</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity around,</v>

1687
01:27:34.170 --> 01:27:35.003
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the late 18 hundreds that laid them </v>

1688
01:27:36.551 --> 01:27:41.320
<v Speaker 2>wide open for an invasion of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the invasion of rationalistic utopia</v>

1689
01:27:41.321 --> 01:27:44.410
<v Speaker 2>notions and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the death of the consequent death of</v>

1690
01:27:44.411 --> 01:27:47.650
<v Speaker 2>66 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't as if the Catholic priests</v>

1691
01:27:47.651 --> 01:27:48.484
<v Speaker 2>were entirely wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What Galileo had to say was dangerous </v>

1692
01:27:52.150 --> 01:27:52.600
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

1693
01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:53.433
<v Speaker 2>in the highest order has taken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's how long since Galileo made his </v>

1694
01:27:57.401 --> 01:28:00.610
<v Speaker 2>discovered 300 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1695
01:28:00.611 --> 01:28:05.440
<v Speaker 2>Does anybody know anyways?</v>
<v Speaker 2>400 years I can say.</v>

1696
01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:08.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1697
01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:10.153
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all think that was just perfectly </v>

1698
01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:14.330
<v Speaker 2>positive and understandably so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1699
01:28:14.331 --> 01:28:17.110
<v Speaker 2>it's sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sad that the real danger.</v>

1700
01:28:23.770 --> 01:28:24.260
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1701
01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:25.041
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1702
01:28:25.041 --> 01:28:29.060
<v Speaker 2>it's more complex than that because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Catholic priesthood and religious people</v>

1703
01:28:29.061 --> 01:28:29.894
<v Speaker 2>in general ever since then have not been</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to figure out what to do with </v>

1704
01:28:32.601 --> 01:28:33.434
<v Speaker 2>Galileo was information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The perceived motivational significance </v>

1705
01:28:35.991 --> 01:28:39.740
<v Speaker 2>was this is a death blow to everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we believe in,</v>

1706
01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:42.830
<v Speaker 2>and this is not trivial because as </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nietzsche points out,</v>

1707
01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:46.520
<v Speaker 2>clearly in Western society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least our morality,</v>

1708
01:28:46.700 --> 01:28:49.760
<v Speaker 2>which is our behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has Judeo Christian roots,</v>

1709
01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:52.400
<v Speaker 2>has a Judeo Christian trunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

1710
01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:53.353
<v Speaker 2>If you chop off the trunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the rationale for the morality </v>

1711
01:28:55.971 --> 01:28:56.804
<v Speaker 2>disappears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you might not know that and you </v>

1712
01:28:58.311 --> 01:29:00.440
<v Speaker 2>might not accept it at a cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>

1713
01:29:00.590 --> 01:29:02.340
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't stop it from being </v>
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

1714
01:29:02.750 --> 01:29:04.250
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would say that the,</v>

1715
01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:05.473
<v Speaker 6>the religious of Galileo's time in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>modern times for that matter </v>

1716
01:29:09.660 --> 01:29:13.740
<v Speaker 6>misconstrued the motivational </v>
<v Speaker 6>significance of Galileo's discovery.</v>

1717
01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:15.053
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because they were under the presumption </v>

1718
01:29:16.651 --> 01:29:17.484
<v Speaker 6>that they're religious theories of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>nature of the universe described the </v>

1719
01:29:22.261 --> 01:29:24.420
<v Speaker 6>same universe that Galileo is </v>
<v Speaker 6>describing.</v>

1720
01:29:24.421 --> 01:29:26.610
<v Speaker 6>I don't think that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The religious stories,</v>

1721
01:29:26.611 --> 01:29:27.444
<v Speaker 6>we're trying to describe how the world </v>
<v Speaker 6>was constructed with regards to its </v>

1722
01:29:31.531 --> 01:29:35.070
<v Speaker 6>implications for action,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is absolutely vital.</v>

1723
01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:36.053
<v Speaker 6>You have to know that whereas Galileo </v>
<v Speaker 6>was doing something related but </v>

1724
01:29:39.181 --> 01:29:42.150
<v Speaker 6>different.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So there they are conflict,</v>

1725
01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:46.710
<v Speaker 6>a death conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Definitely conflict was seeing where one</v>

1726
01:29:46.711 --> 01:29:47.544
<v Speaker 6>did not actually exist in sense,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they could scarcely avoided since </v>

1727
01:29:50.941 --> 01:29:53.940
<v Speaker 6>the tumor had been combined right before</v>
<v Speaker 6>previously.</v>

1728
01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:55.470
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>

1729
01:29:55.890 --> 01:29:56.723
<v Speaker 6>It was inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There wasn't any need to separate </v>

1730
01:29:58.220 --> 01:30:01.140
<v Speaker 6>before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No and no methodology for doing so.</v>

1731
01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:02.753
<v Speaker 6>So it's not surprising,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's worthwhile to consider that </v>

1732
01:30:06.331 --> 01:30:07.164
<v Speaker 6>some of the intelligence was in fact on </v>
<v Speaker 6>the side of the Catholic priesthood in </v>

1733
01:30:11.131 --> 01:30:12.870
<v Speaker 6>which is something we tend not to think </v>
<v Speaker 6>about.</v>

1734
01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:15.600
<v Speaker 6>I mean they were at least for all of </v>
<v Speaker 6>their flaws,</v>

1735
01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:17.880
<v Speaker 6>which are the flaws of any organized </v>
<v Speaker 6>system.</v>

1736
01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:21.240
<v Speaker 6>They're on the side of a certain amount </v>
<v Speaker 6>of stability,</v>

1737
01:30:21.241 --> 01:30:22.074
<v Speaker 6>which is also necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you can say what you want about the </v>

1738
01:30:25.051 --> 01:30:25.884
<v Speaker 6>kind of stability that they provided.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the thing is stability always comes </v>

1739
01:30:29.371 --> 01:30:30.690
<v Speaker 6>at a cost,</v>
<v Speaker 6>always,</v>

1740
01:30:31.230 --> 01:30:32.820
<v Speaker 6>always.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

1741
01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:35.590
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1742
01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:40.200
<v Speaker 6>I want to show you a couple of things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is like,</v>

1743
01:30:40.201 --> 01:30:41.034
<v Speaker 6>I would rather have the class go like </v>
<v Speaker 6>this actually then for me just to </v>

1744
01:30:44.521 --> 01:30:48.780
<v Speaker 6>outline during the lectures what you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to be reading anyways.</v>

1745
01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:49.943
<v Speaker 6>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would rather use this as a forum for </v>

1746
01:30:51.691 --> 01:30:52.524
<v Speaker 6>discussion of the issues that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>reading brings up that would make it a </v>

1747
01:30:55.430 --> 01:31:00.040
<v Speaker 6>much more participatory enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I got,</v>

1748
01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:02.180
<v Speaker 6>what I would hope is that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1749
01:31:02.220 --> 01:31:03.053
<v Speaker 6>we could as a group get immersed in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>material that we'll be discussing and </v>

1750
01:31:07.621 --> 01:31:12.621
<v Speaker 6>hack away at it critically in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>during the course of these classes.</v>

1751
01:31:13.710 --> 01:31:14.543
<v Speaker 6>I just want to end with a very brief </v>
<v Speaker 6>summary of what I was going to discuss </v>

1752
01:31:18.361 --> 01:31:19.194
<v Speaker 6>in part today.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it looks to me like your brain </v>

1753
01:31:21.871 --> 01:31:26.871
<v Speaker 6>is organized to react to the universe as</v>
<v Speaker 6>if it's constructed of three things.</v>

1754
01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:31.050
<v Speaker 6>And these are things that constantly are</v>
<v Speaker 6>described in mythological stories of the</v>

1755
01:31:31.051 --> 01:31:31.884
<v Speaker 6>nature of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And one of the things is the territory </v>

1756
01:31:33.931 --> 01:31:38.700
<v Speaker 6>that you have explored and the other is </v>
<v Speaker 6>the territory that you haven't explored.</v>

1757
01:31:39.090 --> 01:31:42.570
<v Speaker 6>And the third is the process of </v>
<v Speaker 6>exploration itself.</v>

1758
01:31:42.750 --> 01:31:43.320
<v Speaker 6>And those,</v>
<v Speaker 6>those,</v>

1759
01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:46.830
<v Speaker 6>those three things you can regard as </v>
<v Speaker 6>environmental constants,</v>

1760
01:31:47.250 --> 01:31:49.560
<v Speaker 6>they're always there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>As long as there's been human beings,</v>

1761
01:31:49.561 --> 01:31:51.060
<v Speaker 6>those three things have always been </v>
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>

1762
01:31:51.061 --> 01:31:53.940
<v Speaker 6>And as far as we can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as long as they're human beings,</v>

1763
01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:56.370
<v Speaker 6>those three things will continue to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>

1764
01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:57.533
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cause there's always things that you've </v>

1765
01:31:58.201 --> 01:31:59.034
<v Speaker 6>mapped and things that you haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and there's always the process of doing </v>

1766
01:32:01.781 --> 01:32:02.614
<v Speaker 6>the mapping.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the world from the mythological </v>

1767
01:32:05.081 --> 01:32:05.914
<v Speaker 6>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it appears to me also from the </v>

1768
01:32:07.031 --> 01:32:09.530
<v Speaker 6>neuropsychological perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1769
01:32:09.670 --> 01:32:10.503
<v Speaker 6>I want to show you a picture,</v>
<v Speaker 6>say from the neuropsychological </v>

1770
01:32:13.481 --> 01:32:14.314
<v Speaker 6>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could construe us as specialized </v>

1771
01:32:16.781 --> 01:32:17.614
<v Speaker 6>primarily for exploration and for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>communication of the things of the </v>

1772
01:32:24.131 --> 01:32:26.890
<v Speaker 6>knowledge that we've generated as a </v>
<v Speaker 6>consequence of exploration.</v>

1773
01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:27.993
<v Speaker 6>And to buttress this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to show you some diagrams of the </v>

1774
01:32:30.221 --> 01:32:32.230
<v Speaker 6>representation of the body and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>brain.</v>

1775
01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:36.240
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1776
01:32:38.970 --> 01:32:39.990
<v Speaker 6>Here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

1777
01:32:40.710 --> 01:32:42.360
<v Speaker 6>let me just show you where it is first.</v>

1778
01:32:46.540 --> 01:32:47.373
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1779
01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:52.630
<v Speaker 6>This is the motor unit of your brain and</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is the sensory unit,</v>

1780
01:32:53.490 --> 01:32:55.540
<v Speaker 6>how the motor units is about half of </v>
<v Speaker 6>your brain.</v>

1781
01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:59.320
<v Speaker 6>And it's also the part that we haven't </v>
<v Speaker 6>been able to figure out what does,</v>

1782
01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:02.860
<v Speaker 6>we haven't been able to figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 6>it does very well.</v>

1783
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:04.183
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>lesions in this part of your brain </v>

1784
01:33:06.101 --> 01:33:09.340
<v Speaker 6>produce snow decrements in static Iq </v>
<v Speaker 6>has,</v>

1785
01:33:09.341 --> 01:33:10.174
<v Speaker 6>you will know if you read that paper by </v>
<v Speaker 6>Joan Dunkin that's in the collection of </v>

1786
01:33:12.791 --> 01:33:13.624
<v Speaker 6>papers for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People weren't sure what this part of </v>

1787
01:33:15.161 --> 01:33:15.994
<v Speaker 6>the brain does anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What it does is sequence abstractly </v>

1788
01:33:18.851 --> 01:33:22.600
<v Speaker 6>sequence motor activity at least in part</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a big part of its role.</v>

1789
01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:23.553
<v Speaker 6>This is the motor strip right there and </v>
<v Speaker 6>damage to that part of the brain </v>

1790
01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:28.630
<v Speaker 6>interferes with your ability to actually</v>
<v Speaker 6>move your body and you could.</v>

1791
01:33:28.930 --> 01:33:29.763
<v Speaker 6>This part which is the prefrontal cortex</v>
<v Speaker 6>grew out of the motor strip during </v>

1792
01:33:32.681 --> 01:33:36.010
<v Speaker 6>evolution and that provides a clue to </v>
<v Speaker 6>its essential function.</v>

1793
01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:38.950
<v Speaker 6>As evolution progressed in that part of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the brain gain in size,</v>

1794
01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:41.650
<v Speaker 6>which you did in a tremendous to a </v>
<v Speaker 6>tremendous degree,</v>

1795
01:33:41.651 --> 01:33:42.870
<v Speaker 6>much more,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was,</v>

1796
01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:44.500
<v Speaker 6>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>than any other form of animal.</v>

1797
01:33:44.740 --> 01:33:45.573
<v Speaker 6>We became able to abstractly act and </v>
<v Speaker 6>abstract action is very useful because </v>

1798
01:33:49.391 --> 01:33:50.224
<v Speaker 6>if you can act abstractly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can think your way out if novel </v>

1799
01:33:52.451 --> 01:33:54.850
<v Speaker 6>situations without actually having to </v>
<v Speaker 6>put yourself in them.</v>

1800
01:33:55.090 --> 01:33:58.480
<v Speaker 6>And obviously that's useful because then</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can get the damn information without</v>

1801
01:33:58.481 --> 01:34:00.610
<v Speaker 6>getting killed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you can also,</v>

1802
01:34:00.790 --> 01:34:02.980
<v Speaker 6>you can also watch other people for </v>
<v Speaker 6>example,</v>

1803
01:34:02.981 --> 01:34:05.860
<v Speaker 6>and imitate them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which means you can get their behavioral</v>

1804
01:34:05.861 --> 01:34:06.694
<v Speaker 6>wisdom without,</v>
<v Speaker 6>without actually having to go through </v>

1805
01:34:08.411 --> 01:34:11.120
<v Speaker 6>all the aggravation of learning what it </v>
<v Speaker 6>was that they are encountering,</v>

1806
01:34:11.170 --> 01:34:12.260
<v Speaker 6>what it was they had to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1807
01:34:12.261 --> 01:34:16.090
<v Speaker 6>they were formulating those patterns of </v>
<v Speaker 6>motor behavior anyways</v>

1808
01:34:19.290 --> 01:34:24.290
<v Speaker 6>were specialized for exploration and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well let's take a look at that.</v>

1809
01:34:25.770 --> 01:34:29.970
<v Speaker 6>This is how your body is represented in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the motor and the sensory cortex.</v>

1810
01:34:29.971 --> 01:34:31.740
<v Speaker 6>I want you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's pretty similar really,</v>

1811
01:34:31.930 --> 01:34:34.410
<v Speaker 6>but I want you to pay most attention to </v>
<v Speaker 6>the motor cortex.</v>

1812
01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:35.273
<v Speaker 6>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's quite interesting because this is </v>

1813
01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:38.113
<v Speaker 6>how what your brain thinks of your body </v>
<v Speaker 6>in a sense from the perspective of you </v>

1814
01:34:43.051 --> 01:34:45.720
<v Speaker 6>being a thing that can do things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All right,</v>

1815
01:34:45.721 --> 01:34:47.700
<v Speaker 6>and as you'd suspect,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1816
01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.070
<v Speaker 6>what's a human being?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1817
01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:52.050
<v Speaker 6>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're all thumbs.</v>

1818
01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:55.410
<v Speaker 6>I look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean the thumb is bigger than the rest</v>

1819
01:34:55.411 --> 01:34:58.790
<v Speaker 6>of the body by a substantial well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>thumb and ham.</v>

1820
01:34:58.791 --> 01:34:59.960
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the,</v>

1821
01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:02.780
<v Speaker 6>that's what we are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And also Tom,</v>

1822
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:06.140
<v Speaker 6>that's the tongue there and face.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well that's what we're like.</v>

1823
01:35:06.141 --> 01:35:06.974
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let me show you kind of have a better </v>

1824
01:35:09.831 --> 01:35:11.180
<v Speaker 6>representation of this.</v>

1825
01:35:11.650 --> 01:35:16.650
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1826
01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:22.400
<v Speaker 6>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is,</v>

1827
01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:26.060
<v Speaker 6>this isn't quite right does this is the </v>
<v Speaker 6>sensory homonculus but you still get the</v>

1828
01:35:26.061 --> 01:35:27.230
<v Speaker 6>basic idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1829
01:35:27.231 --> 01:35:31.250
<v Speaker 6>That's now the motor homunculus is even </v>
<v Speaker 6>more exaggerated than this,</v>

1830
01:35:31.251 --> 01:35:32.084
<v Speaker 6>which is to say that the motor </v>
<v Speaker 6>representation throws even more weight </v>

1831
01:35:36.291 --> 01:35:37.124
<v Speaker 6>on the hands and the face.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well that's our capacity to pick things </v>

1832
01:35:41.301 --> 01:35:43.670
<v Speaker 6>apart and put them back together to </v>
<v Speaker 6>manipulate the world.</v>

1833
01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:47.000
<v Speaker 6>And this is our capacity essentially to </v>
<v Speaker 6>communicate.</v>

1834
01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:49.850
<v Speaker 6>You can't see the tongue representation </v>
<v Speaker 6>in here,</v>

1835
01:35:49.851 --> 01:35:50.684
<v Speaker 6>but</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're creatures who are specialized to </v>

1836
01:35:54.740 --> 01:35:58.400
<v Speaker 6>encounter things that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 6>understand and to make of them something</v>

1837
01:35:58.401 --> 01:35:59.234
<v Speaker 6>that we want,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is not the same as exploring them </v>

1838
01:36:01.521 --> 01:36:03.560
<v Speaker 6>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Precisely that we have another kind of a</v>

1839
01:36:03.561 --> 01:36:05.590
<v Speaker 6>cockeyed notion about what expiration </v>
<v Speaker 6>means.</v>

1840
01:36:05.620 --> 01:36:08.060
<v Speaker 6>We tend to think that when we explore </v>
<v Speaker 6>something unknown,</v>

1841
01:36:08.061 --> 01:36:08.894
<v Speaker 6>we discover its properties.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But that's a strange notion because </v>

1842
01:36:11.901 --> 01:36:12.734
<v Speaker 6>usually what we're trying to do when we </v>
<v Speaker 6>explore something is not so much </v>

1843
01:36:14.721 --> 01:36:16.970
<v Speaker 6>discovered the sensory properties of </v>
<v Speaker 6>something,</v>

1844
01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:20.360
<v Speaker 6>but to turn something that has </v>
<v Speaker 6>indeterminant significance,</v>

1845
01:36:20.361 --> 01:36:23.510
<v Speaker 6>which means it could be threatening or </v>
<v Speaker 6>promising into something that we can,</v>

1846
01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:25.970
<v Speaker 6>that we can either ignore or use.</v>

1847
01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:27.313
<v Speaker 6>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'll have to think through that </v>

1848
01:36:29.181 --> 01:36:32.090
<v Speaker 6>argument I guess on your own because we </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't have enough time to discuss it.</v>

1849
01:36:32.091 --> 01:36:32.924
<v Speaker 6>But the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that the universe that we inhabit is </v>

1850
01:36:35.241 --> 01:36:36.074
<v Speaker 6>not entirely given.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's also something that we erect as a </v>

1851
01:36:38.931 --> 01:36:41.510
<v Speaker 6>consequence of our actions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And there's um,</v>

1852
01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:42.453
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1853
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:49.010
<v Speaker 6>which is to say that it's the process.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the process of exploration,</v>

1854
01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:50.353
<v Speaker 6>which is in large part linguistically </v>
<v Speaker 6>mediated that brings into being the </v>

1855
01:36:54.171 --> 01:36:57.920
<v Speaker 6>world that we regard as familiar and the</v>
<v Speaker 6>world that we inhabit.</v>

1856
01:36:58.220 --> 01:36:59.780
<v Speaker 6>And that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>

1857
01:36:59.810 --> 01:37:01.670
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1858
01:37:01.671 --> 01:37:03.740
<v Speaker 6>I can tell you for example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the Sumerian,</v>

1859
01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:08.060
<v Speaker 6>most primordial of Sumerian creation </v>
<v Speaker 6>myths,</v>

1860
01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:10.093
<v Speaker 6>there's a god goddess sort of of </v>
<v Speaker 6>indeterminate sexuality that represents </v>

1861
01:37:14.121 --> 01:37:17.600
<v Speaker 6>chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who's divided into the male sky.</v>

1862
01:37:17.601 --> 01:37:20.690
<v Speaker 6>And the female earth and who is </v>
<v Speaker 6>separated.</v>

1863
01:37:20.691 --> 01:37:23.810
<v Speaker 6>These two daddies are separated by the </v>
<v Speaker 6>god of the atmosphere.</v>

1864
01:37:23.811 --> 01:37:25.310
<v Speaker 6>So you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well again,</v>

1865
01:37:25.311 --> 01:37:26.144
<v Speaker 6>from the Sumerian perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the universe is composed of the </v>

1866
01:37:29.210 --> 01:37:30.043
<v Speaker 6>primordial chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then a masculine principle that in this </v>

1867
01:37:33.501 --> 01:37:34.334
<v Speaker 6>mythology is represented by this guy and</v>
<v Speaker 6>a feminine principle that's represented </v>

1868
01:37:36.651 --> 01:37:37.484
<v Speaker 6>by the earth and the process that </v>
<v Speaker 6>separates them or distinguishes between </v>

1869
01:37:40.461 --> 01:37:42.260
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's the god of the atmosphere.</v>

1870
01:37:42.261 --> 01:37:43.520
<v Speaker 6>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a,</v>

1871
01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:49.520
<v Speaker 6>that's a wholly triad,</v>
<v Speaker 6>basically father,</v>

1872
01:37:49.521 --> 01:37:51.860
<v Speaker 6>mother and divine son.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In Christianity,</v>

1873
01:37:51.861 --> 01:37:52.694
<v Speaker 6>there's the doctrine of the logos,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is the word and the word is the </v>

1874
01:37:54.990 --> 01:37:58.990
<v Speaker 6>thing that in gendered creation and the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1875
01:37:59.080 --> 01:37:59.913
<v Speaker 6>the derivation of the logos,</v>
<v Speaker 6>while the idea of the logo schools all </v>

1876
01:38:02.611 --> 01:38:03.444
<v Speaker 6>the way back through Egyptian society </v>
<v Speaker 6>into Mesopotamian society and reflects </v>

1877
01:38:07.291 --> 01:38:11.520
<v Speaker 6>people's intuition that there was some </v>
<v Speaker 6>integral relationship between the nature</v>

1878
01:38:11.521 --> 01:38:16.521
<v Speaker 6>of the world as we inhabited and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>process that generates that world in the</v>

1879
01:38:16.621 --> 01:38:17.454
<v Speaker 6>context of exploration.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the myths say the capacity for </v>

1880
01:38:20.521 --> 01:38:25.380
<v Speaker 6>exploration is a function of that which </v>
<v Speaker 6>already existed.</v>

1881
01:38:25.410 --> 01:38:29.190
<v Speaker 6>And simultaneously the thing that brings</v>
<v Speaker 6>both chaos in order into being,</v>

1882
01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:30.113
<v Speaker 6>so it's both,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's the offspring of chaos and order </v>

1883
01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:33.473
<v Speaker 6>and the thing that creates them that </v>
<v Speaker 6>we're not used to thinking in causal </v>

1884
01:38:35.941 --> 01:38:37.260
<v Speaker 6>loops like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But well,</v>

1885
01:38:37.261 --> 01:38:39.690
<v Speaker 6>mythology could care less whether you </v>
<v Speaker 6>can understand it.</v>

1886
01:38:39.690 --> 01:38:44.310
<v Speaker 6>That's basically the bottom line.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just a representation of in a sense</v>

1887
01:38:44.311 --> 01:38:46.260
<v Speaker 6>of the way that things are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

1888
01:38:46.261 --> 01:38:50.010
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that x except even more exaggerated.</v>

1889
01:38:50.011 --> 01:38:52.260
<v Speaker 6>That's what we are from the perspective </v>
<v Speaker 6>of our brain.</v>

1890
01:38:52.261 --> 01:38:52.861
<v Speaker 6>And you say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1891
01:38:52.861 --> 01:38:54.720
<v Speaker 6>this might you think this might be a </v>
<v Speaker 6>trivial,</v>

1892
01:38:55.220 --> 01:38:56.940
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a trivial statement.</v>

1893
01:38:56.941 --> 01:38:58.920
<v Speaker 6>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1894
01:38:58.950 --> 01:39:01.020
<v Speaker 6>I just picked the motor strip in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>sensory stuff.</v>

1895
01:39:01.021 --> 01:39:01.854
<v Speaker 6>That's not a very big part of the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you have to realize that the </v>

1896
01:39:04.711 --> 01:39:05.544
<v Speaker 6>prefrontal cortex is the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 6>provides abstract programming for the </v>

1897
01:39:09.241 --> 01:39:10.074
<v Speaker 6>motor strip.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the prefrontal cortex is concerned </v>

1898
01:39:11.671 --> 01:39:12.504
<v Speaker 6>with the programming of movement and the</v>
<v Speaker 6>sensory cortex well is mostly taken up </v>

1899
01:39:16.351 --> 01:39:17.490
<v Speaker 6>by the visual system.</v>

1900
01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:22.410
<v Speaker 6>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is a good picture of who we are.</v>

1901
01:39:22.650 --> 01:39:23.483
<v Speaker 6>And I want to extend that argument by </v>
<v Speaker 6>pointing out that people have made much </v>

1902
01:39:27.361 --> 01:39:30.030
<v Speaker 6>of the supposed intelligence of dolphins</v>
<v Speaker 6>and whales.</v>

1903
01:39:30.031 --> 01:39:31.530
<v Speaker 6>And the reason they'd done this is </v>
<v Speaker 6>because,</v>

1904
01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:35.160
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your intelligence is dependent on part,</v>

1905
01:39:35.161 --> 01:39:38.700
<v Speaker 6>on the area of the gray matter of your </v>
<v Speaker 6>cortex.</v>

1906
01:39:38.701 --> 01:39:40.620
<v Speaker 6>And we have about a meter of gray </v>
<v Speaker 6>matter.</v>

1907
01:39:40.621 --> 01:39:43.440
<v Speaker 6>If you spread it out on you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>spread it out in a sheet,</v>

1908
01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:45.720
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the more gray matter,</v>

1909
01:39:45.740 --> 01:39:46.573
<v Speaker 6>the more intelligence roughly or new,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or you could say the ratio of brain </v>

1910
01:39:48.991 --> 01:39:51.060
<v Speaker 6>tissue to bodyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the encephalization.</v>

1911
01:39:51.061 --> 01:39:55.200
<v Speaker 6>Quotion is a rough estimate of animal </v>
<v Speaker 6>intelligence and dolphins have very high</v>

1912
01:39:55.201 --> 01:39:59.070
<v Speaker 6>encephalization factors and tremendously</v>
<v Speaker 6>convoluted cortex,</v>

1913
01:39:59.071 --> 01:40:00.120
<v Speaker 6>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So people think,</v>

1914
01:40:00.121 --> 01:40:01.650
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're extraordinarily intelligent,</v>

1915
01:40:01.651 --> 01:40:02.484
<v Speaker 6>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is simplistic thinking as far as </v>

1916
01:40:05.251 --> 01:40:07.170
<v Speaker 6>I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Unless dolphins are doing something that</v>

1917
01:40:07.171 --> 01:40:09.780
<v Speaker 6>we just can absolutely have no </v>
<v Speaker 6>conception of,</v>

1918
01:40:10.110 --> 01:40:11.220
<v Speaker 6>they don't have hands.</v>

1919
01:40:11.730 --> 01:40:12.563
<v Speaker 6>And that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a nontrivial difference because </v>

1920
01:40:14.370 --> 01:40:16.710
<v Speaker 6>it's the hand that makes us in large </v>
<v Speaker 6>part who we are,</v>

1921
01:40:16.711 --> 01:40:18.870
<v Speaker 6>its primary exploratory tool,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1922
01:40:18.871 --> 01:40:21.780
<v Speaker 6>It's the thing by which we construct the</v>
<v Speaker 6>worlds that we live in.</v>

1923
01:40:22.260 --> 01:40:24.090
<v Speaker 6>And I don't mean this in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>mythological sense.</v>

1924
01:40:24.091 --> 01:40:24.924
<v Speaker 6>I mean it just makes us able to build </v>
<v Speaker 6>tables and houses and so on and to </v>

1925
01:40:27.181 --> 01:40:29.940
<v Speaker 6>modify to modify the environment to </v>
<v Speaker 6>suit,</v>

1926
01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:31.073
<v Speaker 6>to suit us and dolphins,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever else you might want to say </v>

1927
01:40:33.631 --> 01:40:35.070
<v Speaker 6>about them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't do that.</v>

1928
01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:36.053
<v Speaker 6>And that's a non trivial difference and </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's the difference is immense and all </v>

1929
01:40:39.151 --> 01:40:39.984
<v Speaker 6>you have to think about it for a few </v>
<v Speaker 6>minutes to to realize that well the </v>

1930
01:40:42.811 --> 01:40:44.430
<v Speaker 6>snake,</v>
<v Speaker 6>does anybody have any idea what the hell</v>

1931
01:40:44.431 --> 01:40:45.264
<v Speaker 6>they're doing when all that brand?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not a lot that they can the same very </v>

1932
01:40:49.111 --> 01:40:53.350
<v Speaker 6>complex songs and they also seem to use </v>
<v Speaker 6>some of,</v>

1933
01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:57.940
<v Speaker 6>well I don't know how that's how that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>attached to the intelligence.</v>

1934
01:40:58.030 --> 01:41:03.030
<v Speaker 6>No is the answer as far as I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they are very intelligent.</v>

1935
01:41:03.310 --> 01:41:04.143
<v Speaker 6>There's no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can teach dolphins to do lots of </v>

1936
01:41:05.561 --> 01:41:06.640
<v Speaker 6>things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you have to,</v>

1937
01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:10.690
<v Speaker 6>you have to realize that your brain is </v>
<v Speaker 6>not a disembodied spirit.</v>

1938
01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:13.690
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's integrity attached to your </v>
<v Speaker 6>body.</v>

1939
01:41:13.870 --> 01:41:14.703
<v Speaker 6>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you might even regarded as part of your </v>

1940
01:41:15.671 --> 01:41:19.180
<v Speaker 6>body.</v>
<v Speaker 6>By the same token,</v>

1941
01:41:19.181 --> 01:41:23.590
<v Speaker 6>your body is the environment to which </v>
<v Speaker 6>your brain has adapted and vice versa.</v>

1942
01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:26.850
<v Speaker 6>And the fact of the structure of your </v>
<v Speaker 6>body is,</v>

1943
01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:29.620
<v Speaker 6>is very relevant to how your brain </v>
<v Speaker 6>functions.</v>

1944
01:41:29.621 --> 01:41:30.454
<v Speaker 6>And it's obvious that a dolphin and </v>
<v Speaker 6>human being are very different in terms </v>

1945
01:41:33.161 --> 01:41:33.994
<v Speaker 6>of morphological structure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not like they just have two brains </v>

1946
01:41:36.191 --> 01:41:37.024
<v Speaker 6>that are the same,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that could easily be transposed at the </v>

1947
01:41:38.921 --> 01:41:40.690
<v Speaker 6>structural level.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The,</v>

1948
01:41:41.110 --> 01:41:43.240
<v Speaker 6>the organs are much,</v>
<v Speaker 6>much different.</v>

1949
01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:44.613
<v Speaker 6>So we're specialized to tear,</v>
<v Speaker 6>tear things apart and put them together </v>

1950
01:41:47.710 --> 01:41:49.570
<v Speaker 6>and to tell other people what we've </v>
<v Speaker 6>done.</v>

1951
01:41:49.810 --> 01:41:50.643
<v Speaker 6>That's what we're like say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>say well that's the process of </v>

1952
01:41:52.601 --> 01:41:54.610
<v Speaker 6>exploration and that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1953
01:41:54.611 --> 01:41:55.444
<v Speaker 6>in a sense that's also the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 6>mythology tells us that we should be </v>

1954
01:41:57.731 --> 01:42:00.730
<v Speaker 6>doing at least when it's necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now the other,</v>

1955
01:42:01.030 --> 01:42:02.710
<v Speaker 6>there's another reason why I brought </v>
<v Speaker 6>this up.</v>

1956
01:42:02.711 --> 01:42:07.711
<v Speaker 6>And that's because art of the part of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the question that sort of underlies this</v>

1957
01:42:08.111 --> 01:42:08.944
<v Speaker 6>course is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is it possible to come up with a </v>

1958
01:42:10.181 --> 01:42:12.310
<v Speaker 6>definition of what constitutes the good </v>
<v Speaker 6>life,</v>

1959
01:42:12.311 --> 01:42:16.030
<v Speaker 6>that source of stable across different </v>
<v Speaker 6>cultural presuppositions?</v>

1960
01:42:16.031 --> 01:42:16.864
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but one of the things that's quite </v>

1961
01:42:17.801 --> 01:42:18.634
<v Speaker 6>interesting as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that novel phenomenon are cues for </v>

1962
01:42:22.091 --> 01:42:22.924
<v Speaker 6>satisfactions,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which makes them incentive rewards and </v>

1963
01:42:25.661 --> 01:42:30.400
<v Speaker 6>incentive rewards make us feel as good </v>
<v Speaker 6>as we can feel fundamentally.</v>

1964
01:42:30.401 --> 01:42:32.560
<v Speaker 6>They also have very analgesic </v>
<v Speaker 6>properties,</v>

1965
01:42:32.561 --> 01:42:33.394
<v Speaker 6>which is quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cocaine is a profound analgesics and </v>

1966
01:42:36.161 --> 01:42:38.320
<v Speaker 6>that basically suggests that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1967
01:42:38.321 --> 01:42:39.154
<v Speaker 6>you're involved in the voluntary </v>
<v Speaker 6>exploration of novelty from the aspect </v>

1968
01:42:42.190 --> 01:42:43.210
<v Speaker 6>of perspective.</v>

1969
01:42:43.570 --> 01:42:46.450
<v Speaker 6>Your brain is functioning in a sense at </v>
<v Speaker 6>its optimal level,</v>

1970
01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:47.553
<v Speaker 6>at least from the effect of perspectives</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're interested in things and you're </v>

1971
01:42:50.591 --> 01:42:53.380
<v Speaker 6>also relatively immune to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to pain.</v>

1972
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:58.000
<v Speaker 6>So he can make of that what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I mean we can just lower this,</v>

1973
01:42:58.001 --> 01:42:58.834
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>down to a more pragmatic level of </v>

1974
01:43:00.011 --> 01:43:00.791
<v Speaker 6>discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1975
01:43:00.791 --> 01:43:04.690
<v Speaker 6>perfectly well from your own experience </v>
<v Speaker 6>that if you're involved in something you</v>

1976
01:43:04.691 --> 01:43:08.980
<v Speaker 6>really find interesting that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well that's about as good as you can.</v>

1977
01:43:09.310 --> 01:43:12.550
<v Speaker 6>That's as good a feeling as you can </v>
<v Speaker 6>possibly hope to generate.</v>

1978
01:43:12.820 --> 01:43:15.670
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>basically what people tend to do I think</v>

1979
01:43:15.671 --> 01:43:20.260
<v Speaker 6>is arrange their lives so that </v>
<v Speaker 6>everything else feeds the possibility of</v>

1980
01:43:20.261 --> 01:43:22.300
<v Speaker 6>them doing something that they really </v>
<v Speaker 6>want to do.</v>

1981
01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:25.450
<v Speaker 6>Although people will sacrifice that </v>
<v Speaker 6>often because they are afraid.</v>

1982
01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:26.673
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1983
01:43:28.180 --> 01:43:31.180
<v Speaker 6>well the reason I'm bringing up this </v>
<v Speaker 6>discussion is because it has employee,</v>

1984
01:43:31.330 --> 01:43:32.163
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it has implications for all sorts of </v>

1985
01:43:33.011 --> 01:43:34.140
<v Speaker 6>things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

1986
01:43:35.290 --> 01:43:36.123
<v Speaker 6>it's also curious,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and this is something you might want to </v>

1987
01:43:37.391 --> 01:43:40.510
<v Speaker 6>think about because it really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's very strange for me.</v>

1988
01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:44.230
<v Speaker 6>I think that the world that myth </v>
<v Speaker 6>describes,</v>

1989
01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:46.180
<v Speaker 6>so let people would say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

1990
01:43:46.630 --> 01:43:47.463
<v Speaker 6>if you had to make a distinction in </v>
<v Speaker 6>terms of the description of reality </v>

1991
01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:52.610
<v Speaker 6>between the scientific</v>

1992
01:43:52.610 --> 01:43:54.560
<v Speaker 2>description and the mythological </v>
<v Speaker 2>description,</v>

1993
01:43:54.770 --> 01:43:55.603
<v Speaker 2>while there's no contest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the scientific description is the </v>

1994
01:43:57.651 --> 01:44:00.380
<v Speaker 2>description of the world and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of evidence on that.</v>

1995
01:44:01.390 --> 01:44:02.460
<v Speaker 2>To that end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1996
01:44:02.540 --> 01:44:03.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>science is a very poor,</v>

1997
01:44:03.741 --> 01:44:06.110
<v Speaker 2>powerful technique,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the peculiar thing is,</v>

1998
01:44:06.111 --> 01:44:09.410
<v Speaker 2>is that you would also say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say as an evolutionary biologist,</v>

1999
01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:13.160
<v Speaker 2>that the world to which your brain has </v>
<v Speaker 2>adapted is the real world.</v>

2000
01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:17.150
<v Speaker 2>And from my perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world that your brain has adapted to</v>

2001
01:44:17.151 --> 01:44:17.984
<v Speaker 2>is the mythological world because your </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain construes things as the territory </v>

2002
01:44:21.951 --> 01:44:24.410
<v Speaker 2>that you've explored,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the territory you haven't,</v>

2003
01:44:24.650 --> 01:44:26.720
<v Speaker 2>and the process that mediates between </v>
<v Speaker 2>the two.</v>

2004
01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:30.200
<v Speaker 2>And</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see why that might be.</v>

2005
01:44:30.201 --> 01:44:33.350
<v Speaker 2>If you think about where danger exists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2006
01:44:33.570 --> 01:44:34.403
<v Speaker 2>hello,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll close this with one interesting </v>

2007
01:44:36.501 --> 01:44:41.000
<v Speaker 2>fact that I learned long after I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>figured out that</v>

2008
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:45.343
<v Speaker 2>that tough people identify those from </v>
<v Speaker 2>different cultures as agents of the </v>

2009
01:44:49.811 --> 01:44:52.090
<v Speaker 2>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Egyptians,</v>

2010
01:44:52.091 --> 01:44:52.924
<v Speaker 2>ancient Egyptians would not let </v>
<v Speaker 2>foreigners into their temples because </v>

2011
01:44:56.350 --> 01:44:57.183
<v Speaker 2>foreigners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're agents of chaos and the temples </v>

2012
01:44:59.411 --> 01:45:00.244
<v Speaker 2>were microcosms of the entire state and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't want the state disrupted by </v>

2013
01:45:03.941 --> 01:45:05.680
<v Speaker 2>the presence of foreigners in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>temples.</v>

2014
01:45:05.690 --> 01:45:06.523
<v Speaker 2>Know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lots of religions still construe the </v>

2015
01:45:08.231 --> 01:45:09.490
<v Speaker 2>world in that matter today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2016
01:45:09.670 --> 01:45:11.560
<v Speaker 2>think of marriage restrictions for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>

2017
01:45:11.561 --> 01:45:12.394
<v Speaker 2>But that's one interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other interesting thing is that the </v>

2018
01:45:15.551 --> 01:45:17.830
<v Speaker 2>Egyptians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it wasn't just the Egyptians,</v>

2019
01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:21.670
<v Speaker 2>he actually identify five cultures that </v>
<v Speaker 2>did exactly the same thing.</v>

2020
01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:25.630
<v Speaker 2>They use the same symbol for the dragon </v>
<v Speaker 2>that ate the sun at night</v>

2021
01:45:27.850 --> 01:45:30.700
<v Speaker 2>and for foreigners for barbarians that </v>
<v Speaker 2>an inhabited,</v>

2022
01:45:30.820 --> 01:45:33.640
<v Speaker 2>unexplored territory and the dragon that</v>
<v Speaker 2>ate the sun at night,</v>

2023
01:45:33.641 --> 01:45:35.680
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the dragon of chaos.</v>

2024
01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:37.193
<v Speaker 2>The daddy that rule prior to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>division of the cosmos into chaos and </v>

2025
01:45:39.941 --> 01:45:40.774
<v Speaker 2>order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could say human human word has a </v>

2026
01:45:43.601 --> 01:45:47.860
<v Speaker 2>natural category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that category is the category of all</v>

2027
01:45:47.861 --> 01:45:50.830
<v Speaker 2>things that have yet to be explored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the unknown.</v>

2028
01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:54.790
<v Speaker 2>And the unknown has a priory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivational significance.</v>

2029
01:45:54.910 --> 01:45:57.500
<v Speaker 2>It's frightening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's also interesting and it's,</v>

2030
01:45:58.120 --> 01:46:03.120
<v Speaker 2>it's natural to us to not to associate </v>
<v Speaker 2>foreigners with that category,</v>

2031
01:46:05.110 --> 01:46:07.600
<v Speaker 2>but to presume that they occupied the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same domain,</v>

2032
01:46:07.601 --> 01:46:08.434
<v Speaker 2>which is even more fundamental.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like the Egyptian stock </v>

2033
01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:12.033
<v Speaker 2>foreigners chaos equivalent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the Egyptians thought was that </v>

2034
01:46:15.460 --> 01:46:19.390
<v Speaker 2>these two things were the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They hadn't yet been distinguished.</v>

2035
01:46:19.510 --> 01:46:23.530
<v Speaker 2>It's more fundamental than a mere </v>
<v Speaker 2>association is that the foreigner is the</v>

2036
01:46:23.531 --> 01:46:24.364
<v Speaker 2>ancient of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that basically means that your </v>

2037
01:46:26.201 --> 01:46:31.201
<v Speaker 2>response to the foreigner is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>integrally tied into the manner in which</v>

2038
01:46:31.451 --> 01:46:35.530
<v Speaker 2>you approach chaos as part of your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as part of the nature of your being.</v>

2039
01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:36.513
<v Speaker 2>So your attitude towards the terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown is the same as your attitude </v>

2040
01:46:40.241 --> 01:46:41.510
<v Speaker 2>towards the stranger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2041
01:46:41.630 --> 01:46:43.060
<v Speaker 2>that's something to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

2042
01:46:45.490 --> 01:46:47.170
<v Speaker 2>well questions.</v>

2043
01:46:50.980 --> 01:46:52.740
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2044
01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:56.190
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What exactly do you want to know?</v>

2045
01:46:56.670 --> 01:46:58.740
<v Speaker 6>Look all I'll tell you about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Generally.</v>

2046
01:46:58.830 --> 01:47:02.200
<v Speaker 6>I want you to pick something that is </v>
<v Speaker 6>interesting to you.</v>

2047
01:47:03.510 --> 01:47:04.343
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's relevant to the topics that </v>

2048
01:47:06.991 --> 01:47:10.830
<v Speaker 6>we've discussed in the course.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And those are the two major criteria.</v>

2049
01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:11.873
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't just want a summary of what </v>

2050
01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:15.533
<v Speaker 6>we've discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want you to take what we've discussed </v>

2051
01:47:17.551 --> 01:47:20.370
<v Speaker 6>and apply it to a problem that you find </v>
<v Speaker 6>compelling.</v>

2052
01:47:20.970 --> 01:47:21.803
<v Speaker 7>MMM,</v>

2053
01:47:24.580 --> 01:47:25.540
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's basic.</v>

2054
01:47:25.541 --> 01:47:27.220
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's basically the bottom line.</v>

2055
01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:28.393
<v Speaker 7>MMM.</v>

2056
01:47:30.730 --> 01:47:32.480
<v Speaker 6>During the next class.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

2057
01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:36.470
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The dates are screwy on the syllabus,</v>

2058
01:47:36.500 --> 01:47:39.590
<v Speaker 6>but the class times when they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>supposed to be handed in.</v>

2059
01:47:39.591 --> 01:47:42.200
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So next class is class four.</v>

2060
01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:43.733
<v Speaker 6>It's going to summarize really quickly </v>
<v Speaker 6>the way you just said in like two </v>

2061
01:47:45.291 --> 01:47:45.981
<v Speaker 6>sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2062
01:47:45.981 --> 01:47:49.190
<v Speaker 6>So the world is set up into,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for us as a known,</v>

2063
01:47:49.550 --> 01:47:51.740
<v Speaker 6>the unknown and the process which,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which,</v>

2064
01:47:51.770 --> 01:47:53.690
<v Speaker 6>which mediates between the two.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2065
01:47:54.020 --> 01:47:56.360
<v Speaker 6>What we do after that process then is </v>
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>

2066
01:47:56.361 --> 01:47:57.194
<v Speaker 6>they will think is something we use in </v>
<v Speaker 6>that process and things that we don't </v>

2067
01:48:00.291 --> 01:48:02.450
<v Speaker 6>use for that process.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2068
01:48:02.451 --> 01:48:04.490
<v Speaker 6>that the latter part of that isn't quite</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

2069
01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:05.383
<v Speaker 6>Basically what we're trying to do when </v>
<v Speaker 6>we explore the unknown is to manipulate </v>

2070
01:48:09.561 --> 01:48:10.394
<v Speaker 6>the things that we encounter so that </v>
<v Speaker 6>they take on the effect of significance </v>

2071
01:48:13.881 --> 01:48:14.714
<v Speaker 6>that we want,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is now what people would normally </v>

2072
01:48:17.541 --> 01:48:18.374
<v Speaker 6>say as well.</v>

2073
01:48:18.380 --> 01:48:20.870
<v Speaker 6>When we explore something,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we discovered their properties,</v>

2074
01:48:20.871 --> 01:48:24.620
<v Speaker 6>but that's not exactly right because the</v>
<v Speaker 6>properties of something depend very much</v>

2075
01:48:24.621 --> 01:48:25.454
<v Speaker 6>on how you approach it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is the example I used with fire </v>

2076
01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:29.600
<v Speaker 6>and you say before people had mastered </v>
<v Speaker 6>fire,</v>

2077
01:48:29.601 --> 01:48:34.601
<v Speaker 6>it was something unknown and dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mastering fire means erecting a sequence</v>

2078
01:48:35.451 --> 01:48:36.284
<v Speaker 6>of behaviors in the presence of fire </v>
<v Speaker 6>that allow the fire to shift </v>

2079
01:48:39.561 --> 01:48:44.420
<v Speaker 6>motivational category from intrinsically</v>
<v Speaker 6>interesting and threatening to useful in</v>

2080
01:48:44.421 --> 01:48:45.254
<v Speaker 6>some determinant manner.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So when that's what we do when we </v>

2081
01:48:48.981 --> 01:48:49.814
<v Speaker 6>explore,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's where assigning us fixed domain of </v>

2082
01:48:52.701 --> 01:48:56.690
<v Speaker 6>motivational relevance to something that</v>
<v Speaker 6>only exists as possibility.</v>

2083
01:48:56.930 --> 01:48:59.360
<v Speaker 6>And we're doing that by rearranging our </v>
<v Speaker 6>behaviors.</v>

2084
01:48:59.361 --> 01:49:03.380
<v Speaker 6>That's what adaptation means.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you can see this too.</v>

2085
01:49:03.381 --> 01:49:04.214
<v Speaker 6>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you're trying to adapt to the </v>

2086
01:49:05.241 --> 01:49:06.074
<v Speaker 6>presence of another person,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the other person is a very complex and </v>

2087
01:49:08.481 --> 01:49:09.440
<v Speaker 6>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well you,</v>

2088
01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:11.750
<v Speaker 6>you explore someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get to know them.</v>

2089
01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:12.913
<v Speaker 6>But really what you're doing when you </v>
<v Speaker 6>explore someone else is in large part </v>

2090
01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:20.570
<v Speaker 6>matching your behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you,</v>

2091
01:49:20.571 --> 01:49:21.404
<v Speaker 6>if you like the person matching your </v>
<v Speaker 6>behaviors to their expectations so that </v>

2092
01:49:25.130 --> 01:49:29.390
<v Speaker 6>in your presence they only manifest </v>
<v Speaker 6>those phenomena that you want.</v>

2093
01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:30.793
<v Speaker 6>That's exploration.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not mere evocation of all </v>

2094
01:49:33.021 --> 01:49:35.240
<v Speaker 6>possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if I want to get to know you,</v>

2095
01:49:35.241 --> 01:49:36.074
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the things I probably won't want </v>

2096
01:49:37.911 --> 01:49:40.340
<v Speaker 6>to know is how you react.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If I put a knife in your foot.</v>

2097
01:49:40.660 --> 01:49:41.493
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's one category of the phenomena </v>

2098
01:49:43.251 --> 01:49:46.160
<v Speaker 6>that compose you that I'm not interested</v>
<v Speaker 6>in eliciting.</v>

2099
01:49:46.250 --> 01:49:49.840
<v Speaker 6>So it's not random.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Our exploration is not random.</v>

2100
01:49:50.140 --> 01:49:54.070
<v Speaker 6>We're attempting to transform what has </v>
<v Speaker 6>in determining significance,</v>

2101
01:49:54.130 --> 01:49:57.940
<v Speaker 6>which means meaning into something that </v>
<v Speaker 6>we want,</v>

2102
01:49:58.270 --> 01:50:00.790
<v Speaker 6>not something we expect,</v>
<v Speaker 6>something we want.</v>

2103
01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:03.220
<v Speaker 6>That's what they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what adaptation means.</v>

2104
01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:05.980
<v Speaker 6>So most things I just tried to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>neutral.</v>

2105
01:50:06.070 --> 01:50:07.000
<v Speaker 6>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But that's,</v>

2106
01:50:07.001 --> 01:50:07.834
<v Speaker 6>I would say in the sense we want lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well that's also a failure because it's </v>

2107
01:50:11.081 --> 01:50:11.914
<v Speaker 6>better to transform something into a </v>
<v Speaker 6>satisfaction or a promise that into </v>

2108
01:50:15.191 --> 01:50:16.024
<v Speaker 6>something irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Although that's the way that thing most </v>

2109
01:50:17.561 --> 01:50:20.980
<v Speaker 6>things end up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's the best kind of failure,</v>

2110
01:50:21.550 --> 01:50:22.383
<v Speaker 6>but it's still a failure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know that because it's often the </v>

2111
01:50:24.251 --> 01:50:24.941
<v Speaker 6>case.</v>
<v Speaker 6>For example,</v>

2112
01:50:24.941 --> 01:50:25.774
<v Speaker 6>if you're conducting an experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you define something as irrelevant and </v>

2113
01:50:28.781 --> 01:50:30.610
<v Speaker 6>10 years later someone else comes along </v>
<v Speaker 6>and says,</v>

2114
01:50:30.611 --> 01:50:31.444
<v Speaker 6>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's not irrelevant if you treat it </v>

2115
01:50:32.261 --> 01:50:33.094
<v Speaker 6>this way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it has this set of possibilities and </v>

2116
01:50:35.801 --> 01:50:36.634
<v Speaker 6>well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so irrelevant is a dangerous </v>

2117
01:50:39.071 --> 01:50:41.110
<v Speaker 6>categorization as well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cause it probably,</v>

2118
01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:43.720
<v Speaker 6>it may mean that you've overlooked </v>
<v Speaker 6>something important.</v>

2119
01:50:44.260 --> 01:50:47.140
<v Speaker 6>So I know that's how things turn out and</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can understand why and all that.</v>

2120
01:50:47.170 --> 01:50:48.003
<v Speaker 6>But still really successful adaptation </v>
<v Speaker 6>means you turn possibility into desired </v>

2121
01:50:53.591 --> 01:50:54.424
<v Speaker 6>actuality.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Can you do that by rearranging your </v>

2122
01:50:57.131 --> 01:50:59.620
<v Speaker 6>behavior or your scheme of </v>
<v Speaker 6>representation?</v>

2123
01:50:59.650 --> 01:51:00.483
<v Speaker 6>That's</v>

2124
01:51:01.070 --> 01:51:03.400
<v Speaker 7>so</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay.</v>

2125
01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:05.550
<v Speaker 7>And one of the other classes you told us</v>
<v Speaker 7>a story about,</v>

2126
01:51:05.750 --> 01:51:06.583
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was talking about the drive that we </v>

2127
01:51:07.561 --> 01:51:08.394
<v Speaker 7>have to explore new things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you said like babies will fight for </v>

2128
01:51:10.921 --> 01:51:13.620
<v Speaker 7>the chance to explore a toy on the floor</v>
<v Speaker 7>they've never seen before.</v>

2129
01:51:13.830 --> 01:51:17.100
<v Speaker 7>So they're not fighting for the toilet </v>
<v Speaker 7>or fighting for the chance to be the one</v>

2130
01:51:17.101 --> 01:51:20.550
<v Speaker 7>to explore it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I was wondering how,</v>

2131
01:51:21.410 --> 01:51:22.243
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how does that kind of change when you </v>

2132
01:51:23.971 --> 01:51:26.490
<v Speaker 7>get to a level of an adult or a culture </v>
<v Speaker 7>or something?</v>

2133
01:51:26.730 --> 01:51:29.000
<v Speaker 7>And how has that affected by,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

2134
01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:30.990
<v Speaker 7>I guess you'd have to know this is a </v>
<v Speaker 7>presumption,</v>

2135
01:51:30.991 --> 01:51:34.290
<v Speaker 7>but if it seems that we're running out </v>
<v Speaker 7>of objects and things to explore,</v>

2136
01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:35.980
<v Speaker 7>like aside from space,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean we don't know.</v>

2137
01:51:36.070 --> 01:51:37.510
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would say that's a presumption.</v>

2138
01:51:37.511 --> 01:51:38.830
<v Speaker 6>We're not running out of things to it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2139
01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:42.070
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

2140
01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:43.730
<v Speaker 7>I think the nature of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 7>we're,</v>

2141
01:51:43.780 --> 01:51:45.830
<v Speaker 7>that we have to explore is changing in </v>
<v Speaker 7>some way.</v>

2142
01:51:45.890 --> 01:51:50.250
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's like what we can explore now</v>
<v Speaker 7>is more likely,</v>

2143
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:53.630
<v Speaker 7>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like the properties of the ocean or like</v>

2144
01:51:54.020 --> 01:51:57.690
<v Speaker 7>we can fight about it appears to explore</v>
<v Speaker 7>it now.</v>

2145
01:51:58.040 --> 01:52:00.680
<v Speaker 7>It appears to us that that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 7>More of an idea.</v>

2146
01:52:00.770 --> 01:52:01.670
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's,</v>

2147
01:52:01.671 --> 01:52:04.400
<v Speaker 7>we recognize it as more of an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like let's say that,</v>

2148
01:52:04.401 --> 01:52:05.234
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if rushton psychologists are studying </v>

2149
01:52:05.871 --> 01:52:07.580
<v Speaker 7>one thing and American psychologists are</v>
<v Speaker 7>studying,</v>

2150
01:52:08.260 --> 01:52:09.093
<v Speaker 7>you're not as likely to physically fight</v>
<v Speaker 7>over that as if we're fighting over the </v>

2151
01:52:11.770 --> 01:52:15.110
<v Speaker 7>country or a territory or something that</v>
<v Speaker 7>we can conceive as the object.</v>

2152
01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:18.110
<v Speaker 7>It's like we're running on an object and</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're thinking of more ideas.</v>

2153
01:52:18.390 --> 01:52:21.280
<v Speaker 7>And even in the case of space,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it seemed that we saw space.</v>

2154
01:52:21.281 --> 01:52:22.114
<v Speaker 7>There's more of an abstract idea because</v>
<v Speaker 7>space is something that it's not very </v>

2155
01:52:25.071 --> 01:52:26.750
<v Speaker 7>likely to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to be,</v>

2156
01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:28.053
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a dangerous unknown to us unless we go </v>

2157
01:52:29.571 --> 01:52:31.280
<v Speaker 7>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So as long as we stay where we are,</v>

2158
01:52:31.281 --> 01:52:34.280
<v Speaker 7>we can think of it as an idea rather </v>
<v Speaker 7>than as a place.</v>

2159
01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:35.600
<v Speaker 7>And so we had,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2160
01:52:35.601 --> 01:52:37.250
<v Speaker 7>this little space race,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it wasn't,</v>

2161
01:52:37.340 --> 01:52:38.173
<v Speaker 7>it didn't seem to be as,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we didn't get as involved in it as we </v>

2162
01:52:40.461 --> 01:52:41.720
<v Speaker 7>did in previous conflicts.</v>

2163
01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:44.480
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

2164
01:52:44.580 --> 01:52:45.770
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sorry,</v>

2165
01:52:45.771 --> 01:52:46.100
<v Speaker 6>go ahead.</v>

2166
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:46.933
<v Speaker 7>And through that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>our environment is much more </v>

2167
01:52:47.571 --> 01:52:48.340
<v Speaker 7>constructive.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2168
01:52:48.340 --> 01:52:53.340
<v Speaker 7>as much less that we have to worry about</v>
<v Speaker 7>and mean we're exploring more of our own</v>

2169
01:52:53.901 --> 01:52:56.690
<v Speaker 7>construction</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you're billing,</v>

2170
01:52:56.700 --> 01:52:57.533
<v Speaker 7>for me it's more of them because you </v>
<v Speaker 7>don't know all the implications of that </v>

2171
01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:01.873
<v Speaker 7>change sort of title anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean not to look at your lifespan and </v>

2172
01:53:04.561 --> 01:53:07.100
<v Speaker 7>that the position that you're in right </v>
<v Speaker 7>now,</v>

2173
01:53:07.340 --> 01:53:08.173
<v Speaker 7>you're in a position where people try </v>
<v Speaker 7>very hard to make everything was </v>

2174
01:53:10.191 --> 01:53:12.830
<v Speaker 7>predictable for you as possible so you </v>
<v Speaker 7>can focus on ideas,</v>

2175
01:53:13.130 --> 01:53:15.910
<v Speaker 7>but that may not be what your life is </v>
<v Speaker 7>like.</v>

2176
01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:16.913
<v Speaker 6>And it also may seem that in comparison </v>
<v Speaker 6>to things that have been discovered in </v>

2177
01:53:20.031 --> 01:53:20.864
<v Speaker 6>the past,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the things that we're exploring right </v>

2178
01:53:22.191 --> 01:53:23.024
<v Speaker 6>now are more subtle.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I think that's only because we have </v>

2179
01:53:25.461 --> 01:53:26.294
<v Speaker 6>the advantage of viewpoint on the past </v>
<v Speaker 6>to us because of those things have </v>

2180
01:53:29.391 --> 01:53:31.190
<v Speaker 6>already been explored.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They seem obvious.</v>

2181
01:53:31.370 --> 01:53:33.140
<v Speaker 6>But to the people that we're exploring </v>
<v Speaker 6>them,</v>

2182
01:53:33.141 --> 01:53:35.270
<v Speaker 6>when they were still undefined </v>
<v Speaker 6>territory,</v>

2183
01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:36.313
<v Speaker 6>they were as obscure it to them as the </v>
<v Speaker 6>things we explore art us with this </v>

2184
01:53:40.311 --> 01:53:41.330
<v Speaker 6>mysterious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So yeah.</v>

2185
01:53:41.460 --> 01:53:42.293
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Which is to say that if you answer a </v>

2186
01:53:44.001 --> 01:53:45.710
<v Speaker 6>question,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you answer a question,</v>

2187
01:53:45.711 --> 01:53:48.260
<v Speaker 6>but you generate to new problems as a </v>
<v Speaker 6>consequence.</v>

2188
01:53:48.530 --> 01:53:50.090
<v Speaker 6>It's like the introduction of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>computer.</v>

2189
01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:51.273
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it seems like the things where it's </v>

2190
01:53:51.630 --> 01:53:52.463
<v Speaker 7>going now are things that we're not as </v>
<v Speaker 7>likely to see it as a competition for </v>

2191
01:53:55.711 --> 01:53:58.260
<v Speaker 7>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like if I want to study something,</v>

2192
01:53:58.620 --> 01:54:01.320
<v Speaker 7>it doesn't mean that the other person </v>
<v Speaker 7>can't study it.</v>

2193
01:54:01.350 --> 01:54:03.380
<v Speaker 7>It's sort of like you want to own </v>
<v Speaker 7>America,</v>

2194
01:54:03.450 --> 01:54:05.610
<v Speaker 7>you have to fight the other countries </v>
<v Speaker 7>and keep them away from it.</v>

2195
01:54:05.611 --> 01:54:07.230
<v Speaker 7>Otherwise you can't be the one to the </v>
<v Speaker 7>sport.</v>

2196
01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:09.140
<v Speaker 7>But if people want to explore,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2197
01:54:09.160 --> 01:54:11.340
<v Speaker 7>psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you don't have to keep other people from</v>

2198
01:54:11.341 --> 01:54:15.290
<v Speaker 7>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>

2199
01:54:16.580 --> 01:54:17.413
<v Speaker 7>Did your education,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like other countries think academics is </v>

2200
01:54:22.260 --> 01:54:23.093
<v Speaker 7>extremely competitive because you don't </v>
<v Speaker 7>want somebody else who told us your </v>

2201
01:54:24.961 --> 01:54:25.794
<v Speaker 7>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You want to be the one to define the </v>

2202
01:54:27.031 --> 01:54:30.210
<v Speaker 7>terms to set the</v>
<v Speaker 7>day with.</v>

2203
01:54:30.211 --> 01:54:32.470
<v Speaker 7>The questions are,</v>
<v Speaker 7>does that transcribed into the conflict?</v>

2204
01:54:32.471 --> 01:54:35.010
<v Speaker 7>Do you actually try to keep them from </v>
<v Speaker 7>studying it or is it just that you,</v>

2205
01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:37.870
<v Speaker 7>you hope that they don't see?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2206
01:54:37.900 --> 01:54:40.560
<v Speaker 7>are we having cross generational </v>
<v Speaker 7>congregation the,</v>

2207
01:54:42.040 --> 01:54:43.920
<v Speaker 7>we don't fight each other,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but we,</v>

2208
01:54:44.550 --> 01:54:45.810
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but we do fight too.</v>

2209
01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:46.873
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But also has or cultural </v>

2210
01:54:48.121 --> 01:54:48.954
<v Speaker 7>generalizations.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The level at which is actually my skill </v>

2211
01:54:50.650 --> 01:54:51.483
<v Speaker 7>level of the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Some people work with another country </v>

2212
01:54:54.091 --> 01:54:56.190
<v Speaker 7>over.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Those things are just over oil.</v>
