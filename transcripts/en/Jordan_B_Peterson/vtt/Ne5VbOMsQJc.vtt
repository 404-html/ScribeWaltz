1
00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.860
<v Speaker 1>I thought I'd do something different </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.143
<v Speaker 1>so I haven't given this talk before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tackle the issue of free </v>

3
00:00:07.421 --> 00:00:09.250
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From a left wing perspective,</v>

4
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.720
<v Speaker 1>it's actually dead simple to provide a </v>
<v Speaker 1>left wing rationale for free speech.</v>

5
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.990
<v Speaker 1>It should be self evident to people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are pursuing social justice,</v>

6
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.380
<v Speaker 1>that the most potent weapon in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>artillery is the ability to communicate.</v>

7
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.940
<v Speaker 1>What do people who lack power have other</v>
<v Speaker 1>than their ability to speak on their own</v>

8
00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:25.774
<v Speaker 1>behalf and isn't it on their behalf?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That the right to speak must be most </v>

9
00:00:28.781 --> 00:00:31.390
<v Speaker 1>jealously guarded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

10
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.180
<v Speaker 1>I thought I would begin with a crucial </v>
<v Speaker 1>observation.</v>

11
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:35.763
<v Speaker 1>There's a fundamental structural reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>why our political system has developed </v>

12
00:00:38.291 --> 00:00:39.124
<v Speaker 1>both a left and a right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the tendency for scarce </v>

13
00:00:41.621 --> 00:00:43.930
<v Speaker 1>resources to become unequally </v>
<v Speaker 1>distributed.</v>

14
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.730
<v Speaker 1>So let's discuss that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my clinical practice.</v>

15
00:00:48.731 --> 00:00:49.564
<v Speaker 1>I once had a client,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an older guy in his eighties he'd come </v>

16
00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:54.790
<v Speaker 1>to me after his wife had died because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was lonesome,</v>

17
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.930
<v Speaker 1>but also because he was obsessed mostly </v>
<v Speaker 1>with mathematical ideas.</v>

18
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.340
<v Speaker 2>Sasha</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>

19
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.460
<v Speaker 2>he and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I showed it to a woman in our department</v>

20
00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:18.411
<v Speaker 2>who was also very [inaudible] start by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the moment you saw it didn't pretty have</v>

21
00:01:19.381 --> 00:01:23.070
<v Speaker 2>the same effect on me because I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who sees,</v>

22
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.003
<v Speaker 2>I'm not mathematically gifted enough to </v>
<v Speaker 2>seek beauty in symbol that represents </v>

23
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:30.320
<v Speaker 2>that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

24
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:31.573
<v Speaker 2>I got to know him pretty well and was </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually in some sense he was paying me </v>

25
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:36.703
<v Speaker 2>to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just kind of a car to me because I </v>

26
00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:41.000
<v Speaker 2>certainly heard it as much or more from </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

27
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.010
<v Speaker 2>And he did for me is Greece.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I also help him like,</v>

28
00:01:45.011 --> 00:01:45.844
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come to terms with this mathematical </v>

29
00:01:46.661 --> 00:01:47.494
<v Speaker 2>obsession.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He put the stop thinking about </v>

30
00:01:48.221 --> 00:01:49.054
<v Speaker 2>mathematical issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was more or less just the way </v>

31
00:01:50.681 --> 00:01:51.400
<v Speaker 2>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

32
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.220
<v Speaker 2>he was wired that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

33
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.130
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we felt bad about the substance,</v>

34
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.650
<v Speaker 2>but if you're an obsessive genius,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just life.</v>

35
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.513
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people like that and they're </v>

36
00:02:02.111 --> 00:02:05.050
<v Speaker 2>not that common and it's a good bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are some of them and he was one of</v>

37
00:02:05.051 --> 00:02:07.750
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had been a psychology.</v>

38
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.613
<v Speaker 2>Stupid is you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he switched into economics and </v>

39
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.970
<v Speaker 2>tried to learn how big his fortune,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she had been quite successful up and</v>

40
00:02:15.971 --> 00:02:20.920
<v Speaker 2>he introduced me to some concepts that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>have encountered which shocked me.</v>

41
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.373
<v Speaker 2>It shocked me because the concepts to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>introduced me to [inaudible] </v>

42
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.293
<v Speaker 2>fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fundamental importance and I couldn't </v>

43
00:02:31.091 --> 00:02:31.924
<v Speaker 2>believe that I had gone through so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>education and so much further education </v>

44
00:02:37.091 --> 00:02:41.720
<v Speaker 2>and research and develop a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>expertise in statistics.</v>

45
00:02:41.721 --> 00:02:45.010
<v Speaker 2>Although I know statistical expert </v>
<v Speaker 2>without encountering cause.</v>

46
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.120
<v Speaker 2>This said ideas and he introduced me to </v>
<v Speaker 2>web hasn't been come to be known as,</v>

47
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.413
<v Speaker 2>oh it's the work of bill friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll fred old pareto who was an </v>

48
00:02:55.581 --> 00:02:58.910
<v Speaker 2>Italian economist and also the work of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Derek,</v>

49
00:02:58.911 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 2>the solo price.</v>

50
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 2>Who is someone who is studying </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific productivity?</v>

51
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 2>That's the 1960s he wrote a book called </v>
<v Speaker 2>big signs,</v>

52
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:09.180
<v Speaker 2>little science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to get a copy of it,</v>

53
00:03:09.181 --> 00:03:11.750
<v Speaker 2>go on Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try addition again.</v>

54
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.480
<v Speaker 2>I believe the first edition fled to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>south of France.</v>

55
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.010
<v Speaker 2>They never were selling for about 630 </v>
<v Speaker 2>bucks,</v>

56
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.233
<v Speaker 2>which is quite staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it shows you how interested people </v>

57
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:21.934
<v Speaker 2>are and after to get a piece of work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'll tell you about just all </v>

58
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.383
<v Speaker 2>price first and then I'll tell you about</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] and the three of </v>

59
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.883
<v Speaker 2>distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just old price was interested in </v>

60
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.713
<v Speaker 2>scientific productivity and basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>index scientific product candidate by </v>

61
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:40.880
<v Speaker 2>looking at how many sites and get papers</v>
<v Speaker 2>to him.</v>

62
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.770
<v Speaker 2>Scientists publish it and side of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sir I'll set up with precise,</v>

63
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.670
<v Speaker 2>but there they're also obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 2>their seismic publication record because</v>

64
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:49.690
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

65
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.850
<v Speaker 2>they liked status just like the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

66
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.010
<v Speaker 2>And a status has to be measured and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

67
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.430
<v Speaker 2>and track and communicated partly </v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

68
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:01.743
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to promote people and you have </v>

69
00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:04.610
<v Speaker 2>to assess them and you have to hire </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

70
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.230
<v Speaker 2>So you'd have to rank order them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you all keep track of people's</v>

71
00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:10.630
<v Speaker 2>accomplishments that you do that for </v>
<v Speaker 2>under stupidly,</v>

72
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.920
<v Speaker 2>and then you don't hire or promote or </v>
<v Speaker 2>replace the proper people.</v>

73
00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:15.754
<v Speaker 2>So the scientific community has </v>
<v Speaker 2>organized itself very well and keeps </v>

74
00:04:19.421 --> 00:04:20.254
<v Speaker 2>very tight to trap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll different metrics of research post </v>

75
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.923
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the most would be number </v>

76
00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:32.280
<v Speaker 2>of papers published peer reviewed </v>
<v Speaker 2>journals and that's a pretty good one.</v>

77
00:04:32.281 --> 00:04:33.114
<v Speaker 2>As it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pure nominator is actually as it turns </v>

78
00:04:35.201 --> 00:04:36.034
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very excellent index of scientific </v>

79
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.790
<v Speaker 2>quality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

80
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:40.683
<v Speaker 2>partly because generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quality and quantity in a productive </v>

81
00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:46.030
<v Speaker 2>field are quite tightly correlated and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonably how it is.</v>

82
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.103
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of obvious the more you </v>

83
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.450
<v Speaker 2>practice at something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the better the tenant to get out.</v>

84
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.610
<v Speaker 2>So quantity quality tends to be typing </v>
<v Speaker 2>into interlake,</v>

85
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:55.743
<v Speaker 2>but there are other indexes like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>quality of the journal that you publish </v>

86
00:04:59.651 --> 00:05:04.150
<v Speaker 2>in and that's indexed by the average </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of citations that give,</v>

87
00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:06.030
<v Speaker 2>given the paper might get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Psyche,</v>

88
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.670
<v Speaker 2>she copies an indication of impact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

89
00:05:08.671 --> 00:05:09.504
<v Speaker 2>If no one was sites your word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 80% of published humanities papers </v>

90
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.910
<v Speaker 2>at zero citations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a polling people writing those papers,</v>

91
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.940
<v Speaker 2>there's published in journals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a is buying them zero people read them,</v>

92
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.580
<v Speaker 2>scan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cat scan.</v>

93
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.390
<v Speaker 2>He said it's a financial scampi does for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very,</v>

94
00:05:34.391 --> 00:05:37.950
<v Speaker 2>very expensive and that was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>published them because they're expensive</v>

95
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.560
<v Speaker 2>and libraries and path to buy divided.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the library is by them,</v>

96
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:43.323
<v Speaker 2>even though they wouldn't release,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't know insights that they staff </v>

97
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.083
<v Speaker 2>the is the feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they increase the ratio of noise to </v>

98
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.150
<v Speaker 2>signal and we subsidize that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no longer to television.</v>

99
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.630
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the reasons because the bees</v>
<v Speaker 2>are dying,</v>

100
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.590
<v Speaker 2>probably not fast enough.</v>

101
00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.790
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

102
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.210
<v Speaker 2>free to fire up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say more classical approach,</v>

103
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.400
<v Speaker 2>the heart of the university and they no </v>
<v Speaker 2>mistake about if you get universities,</v>

104
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:15.503
<v Speaker 2>you've got the tech stuff and somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>could stuff that can be parceled out </v>

105
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.700
<v Speaker 2>either other agencies and existence to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take care of that humanity humanities at</v>

106
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:23.543
<v Speaker 2>the heart of the university we lose the </v>
<v Speaker 2>university university and now it's a </v>

107
00:06:25.591 --> 00:06:26.424
<v Speaker 2>terrible thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not as terrible as having them </v>

108
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.823
<v Speaker 2>continue on the path that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>authorized down language back to </v>

109
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.673
<v Speaker 2>productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this Sol price was curious about who </v>

110
00:06:38.251 --> 00:06:43.251
<v Speaker 2>is productive and what the differences </v>
<v Speaker 2>in productivity were.</v>

111
00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:44.423
<v Speaker 2>And he had he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he hoped data being average number of </v>

112
00:06:47.761 --> 00:06:48.594
<v Speaker 2>publications that a phd student had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this was in the early sixties upon </v>

113
00:06:52.051 --> 00:06:54.420
<v Speaker 2>graduation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the rates have gone up since then,</v>

114
00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.390
<v Speaker 2>but I've already graduation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're pretty sure that the,</v>

115
00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.250
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned some tape to say in terms </v>
<v Speaker 2>of what we're discussing,</v>

116
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.380
<v Speaker 2>grace of God so that the median number </v>
<v Speaker 2>of publications,</v>

117
00:07:04.381 --> 00:07:07.110
<v Speaker 2>which is the typical number don't be </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours number,</v>

118
00:07:07.111 --> 00:07:07.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

119
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.080
<v Speaker 2>The typical number that people would </v>
<v Speaker 2>produce was one,</v>

120
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.520
<v Speaker 2>one publication and then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well okay fine,</v>

121
00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:16.613
<v Speaker 2>the medium person published one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people publish to and hash it </v>

122
00:07:21.991 --> 00:07:26.991
<v Speaker 2>out was half as many as publish one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the other question was,</v>

123
00:07:27.271 --> 00:07:29.350
<v Speaker 2>well how many people publish straight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has those houses.</v>

124
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:33.970
<v Speaker 2>Then he has published two and four was </v>
<v Speaker 2>half as many as three.</v>

125
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:34.833
<v Speaker 2>Five is half as many as four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what you see isn't it scattered </v>

126
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:42.270
<v Speaker 2>the rapid drop off of productivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as you,</v>

127
00:07:42.271 --> 00:07:46.880
<v Speaker 2>as you move upward in number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>publications and there's a,</v>

128
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.630
<v Speaker 2>there's a side effect to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

129
00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.880
<v Speaker 2>so imagine breath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens is if you're,</v>

130
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.660
<v Speaker 2>if you're graphing come rip people out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a particular number of publications,</v>

131
00:07:54.661 --> 00:07:55.494
<v Speaker 2>you have the vast majority of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have one pop as many to half as </v>

132
00:07:59.611 --> 00:08:01.470
<v Speaker 2>many of these that as three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

133
00:08:01.471 --> 00:08:03.730
<v Speaker 2>five and then you'd get out of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so here in the how,</v>

134
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.140
<v Speaker 2>maybe like 10 or maybe 20 and those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are,</v>

135
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:08.183
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're super geniuses in her field </v>

136
00:08:09.331 --> 00:08:11.460
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're unbelievably smart girl,</v>

137
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:14.580
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are unbelievably productive</v>

138
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:17.563
<v Speaker 2>and it was hard to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so price being an observation about </v>

139
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.440
<v Speaker 2>the scientific productivity and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible,</v>

140
00:08:25.441 --> 00:08:29.860
<v Speaker 2>terrible observation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a hate fact.</v>

141
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:33.863
<v Speaker 2>He observed that if you took a domain of</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific productivity and you were </v>

142
00:08:38.161 --> 00:08:40.380
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out who did it for </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor work,</v>

143
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:41.303
<v Speaker 2>he answered grossed out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the square root of the number of </v>

144
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:44.473
<v Speaker 2>disparities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the number of people who are operating </v>

145
00:08:45.541 --> 00:08:49.590
<v Speaker 2>in that particular specialization </v>
<v Speaker 2>produced half of the publications.</v>

146
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.950
<v Speaker 2>Now it's worthwhile thinking this </v>
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

147
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.050
<v Speaker 2>So let's say you're a candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in a particular,</v>

148
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 2>this also employs applies to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>employee productivity.</v>

149
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:01.930
<v Speaker 2>Incorporations pilate saying general </v>
<v Speaker 2>rehearsal.</v>

150
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.740
<v Speaker 2>So if you got 10 employees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three of them do have to work.</v>

151
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:05.933
<v Speaker 2>Well that's not surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have people who don't do any </v>

152
00:09:07.941 --> 00:09:08.774
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have some people who don't solve in </v>

153
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.420
<v Speaker 2>the work that they actually cost you </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

154
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.820
<v Speaker 2>It's that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the estimate.</v>

155
00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:16.890
<v Speaker 2>There's four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>

156
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:21.950
<v Speaker 2>65% of managers at that negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentality you to become,</v>

157
00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.020
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard growing company,</v>

158
00:09:25.021 --> 00:09:27.390
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to save one and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they fail all the time.</v>

159
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.430
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have 10 free.</v>

160
00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:31.810
<v Speaker 2>You have to work on that because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>seems so bad.</v>

161
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have 25 five you have to work.</v>

162
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:35.603
<v Speaker 2>That's getting rough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a hundred is 10 if you have </v>

163
00:09:37.781 --> 00:09:38.614
<v Speaker 2>a thousand</v>

164
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:43.630
<v Speaker 4>well it's hard to any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's third.</v>

165
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.060
<v Speaker 4>So what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It means that</v>

166
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:55.490
<v Speaker 2>productivity is distributed in a manner </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was described by bill,</v>

167
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.260
<v Speaker 2>frito retail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the free or distribution.</v>

168
00:09:58.890 --> 00:09:59.723
<v Speaker 2>And when you looked at the distribution </v>
<v Speaker 2>of income and the distribution of </v>

169
00:10:02.701 --> 00:10:04.960
<v Speaker 2>wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's prudent Mr View,</v>

170
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:06.383
<v Speaker 2>which means that almost everyone has not</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a few people have a little bit and </v>

171
00:10:11.571 --> 00:10:13.740
<v Speaker 2>then even fewer people have a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than that.</v>

172
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.410
<v Speaker 2>And there's some people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll ace for example,</v>

173
00:10:16.411 --> 00:10:18.160
<v Speaker 2>Carlos Slim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

174
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:23.300
<v Speaker 2>Jeff Bezos who have more money than God</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

175
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:24.713
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's a consequence of improper </v>

176
00:10:26.971 --> 00:10:31.920
<v Speaker 2>social structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the right response to that is no,</v>

177
00:10:31.921 --> 00:10:32.754
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually something more akin to </v>

178
00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:38.970
<v Speaker 2>international law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It governs the same distribution,</v>

179
00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:41.930
<v Speaker 2>garners the size of cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an interest to take.</v>

180
00:10:41.931 --> 00:10:45.270
<v Speaker 2>It also governs decisive planetary </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies.</v>

181
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.280
<v Speaker 2>That's harder to blame on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>patriarchy.</v>

182
00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:48.533
<v Speaker 2>But</v>
<v Speaker 2>he also seems to govern the </v>

183
00:10:55.231 --> 00:10:56.064
<v Speaker 2>distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single thing that you would be </v>

184
00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.930
<v Speaker 2>produced creatively.</v>

185
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:03.480
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean everything,</v>

186
00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:05.470
<v Speaker 2>it's really quite staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if,</v>

187
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:10.520
<v Speaker 2>if it applies to a number of hockey </v>
<v Speaker 2>goals score for example,</v>

188
00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:11.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>set,</v>

189
00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:12.663
<v Speaker 2>set something like Wayne Gretzky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read if you took away all his is </v>

190
00:11:15.991 --> 00:11:16.824
<v Speaker 2>actually gold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd still have more points than any </v>

191
00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:22.860
<v Speaker 2>occupated never late and so ill and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>a shot.</v>

192
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:25.560
<v Speaker 2>That's really interesting it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't tell us 1%.</v>

193
00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:26.281
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's spot.</v>

194
00:11:26.281 --> 00:11:27.114
<v Speaker 2>It's like one 10th of one 10th of 1% of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the people who play hockey get into </v>

195
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.310
<v Speaker 2>the NHL like no one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

196
00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:33.213
<v Speaker 2>Give it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

197
00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:38.460
<v Speaker 2>it does happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're like the allergenic Gel guy.</v>

198
00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.970
<v Speaker 2>Like you're a superstar and then there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>some son of a bitch like the redskins.</v>

199
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:49.220
<v Speaker 2>We'll just stay home piece in all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

200
00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.230
<v Speaker 2>in all of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>still making some pre production.</v>

201
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:57.410
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you people were kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>brands like either it old fashion.</v>

202
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:02.200
<v Speaker 2>So you can talk about Pablo Castle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's an interesting character.</v>

203
00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:04.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're long productive lives.</v>

204
00:12:04.961 --> 00:12:05.794
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hit it.</v>

205
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:07.850
<v Speaker 2>If I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's nineties.</v>

206
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:12.730
<v Speaker 2>Why may I know how many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many more hard macassar produced and</v>

207
00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:13.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might get,</v>

208
00:12:13.391 --> 00:12:15.820
<v Speaker 2>these are just sketches that he was like</v>
<v Speaker 2>just thrown off,</v>

209
00:12:15.821 --> 00:12:20.821
<v Speaker 2>but don't make that go onto the online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the castle archive.</v>

210
00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.880
<v Speaker 2>We're 50,000 of them have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>documented and I can give you the way,</v>

211
00:12:24.881 --> 00:12:28.330
<v Speaker 2>my punchline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But so,</v>

212
00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:29.203
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I thought about it and then I did </v>

213
00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.440
<v Speaker 2>some research to find out how many </v>
<v Speaker 2>artworks,</v>

214
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.430
<v Speaker 2>this crazy character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but bruce,</v>

215
00:12:36.431 --> 00:12:41.431
<v Speaker 2>and the answer was 65,003 day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single day for 65 years.</v>

216
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:48.460
<v Speaker 2>So I try</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do right.</v>

217
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean he wasn't just obsessively </v>
<v Speaker 2>producing artworks,</v>

218
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.113
<v Speaker 2>although he was there like a huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>proportion of those things were </v>

219
00:12:53.951 --> 00:12:55.060
<v Speaker 2>masterpieces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

220
00:12:55.061 --> 00:12:57.310
<v Speaker 2>So this was no pike of this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

221
00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:01.010
<v Speaker 2>he was something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Bach is a good example.</v>

222
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.320
<v Speaker 2>Care as far as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

223
00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:03.643
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote so much music then it wouldn't </v>

224
00:13:06.821 --> 00:13:07.654
<v Speaker 2>take a capias 45 years of eight hour </v>
<v Speaker 2>days just to copy what he had to </v>

225
00:13:15.731 --> 00:13:18.610
<v Speaker 2>propose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these people are,</v>

226
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:21.790
<v Speaker 2>they're off the scale with regards to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they do.</v>

227
00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.410
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you see the same thing,</v>

228
00:13:23.411 --> 00:13:26.760
<v Speaker 2>if you're looking at pat with numbers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that sort of thing and so,</v>

229
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:28.620
<v Speaker 2>so depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She is,</v>

230
00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:29.973
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a really interesting all of </v>

231
00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.970
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is two questions.</v>

232
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:38.290
<v Speaker 2>Why in the world is the world set up </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that?</v>

233
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:41.230
<v Speaker 2>That's the first question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the second question is</v>

234
00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:43.563
<v Speaker 2>what would make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since it makes everything radically </v>

235
00:13:45.761 --> 00:13:48.610
<v Speaker 2>unfair in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least with regards to distribution,</v>

236
00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:49.683
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's,</v>

237
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:50.603
<v Speaker 2>it's good because those people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>producing things like that and the rest </v>

238
00:13:52.541 --> 00:13:54.510
<v Speaker 2>of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in principle get oily.</v>

239
00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:57.490
<v Speaker 2>But nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a big problem with in terms of</v>

240
00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:58.630
<v Speaker 2>inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

241
00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:01.360
<v Speaker 2>of distribution ability and all of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

242
00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:03.400
<v Speaker 2>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is that the case?</v>

243
00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:06.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's one reason.</v>

244
00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.570
<v Speaker 2>So in this is something I've worked on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in part with my,</v>

245
00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:12.520
<v Speaker 2>with my client.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

246
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.490
<v Speaker 2>who else would have a theory on societal</v>
<v Speaker 2>revolutions,</v>

247
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.440
<v Speaker 2>which I think was pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent theory.</v>

248
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.630
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he introduced me to a,</v>

249
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.800
<v Speaker 2>a field of inquiry that I had never </v>
<v Speaker 2>heard about.</v>

250
00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:24.683
<v Speaker 2>People were holding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he caught on physics and I didn't know </v>

251
00:14:27.191 --> 00:14:29.500
<v Speaker 2>there were quantum physicists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are,</v>

252
00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.110
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes they're very productive </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the other ones are</v>

253
00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.053
<v Speaker 2>the economy businesses figured out that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could model the distribution of </v>

254
00:14:38.771 --> 00:14:39.604
<v Speaker 2>money in a population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually the same equations that you </v>

255
00:14:42.341 --> 00:14:46.120
<v Speaker 2>could log in with the distribution of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>gas into a vacuum.</v>

256
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.633
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's a deep interpret like </v>

257
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.480
<v Speaker 2>phenomena driving the distribution of </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

258
00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.313
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and here's how it works while you guys </v>

259
00:14:59.091 --> 00:15:00.740
<v Speaker 2>are hopefully to the mall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

260
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.640
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but often just basically a random walk.</v>

261
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how to play it off when you buy</v>

262
00:15:06.831 --> 00:15:10.380
<v Speaker 2>it an you can as fast as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the first it was the luckiest,</v>

263
00:15:10.381 --> 00:15:11.214
<v Speaker 2>the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's basically the health and all the </v>

264
00:15:12.441 --> 00:15:13.490
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

265
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.440
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you going to say a skill?</v>

266
00:15:15.441 --> 00:15:20.340
<v Speaker 2>There's sort of a modicum of stupidity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid play you lose.</v>

267
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:24.230
<v Speaker 2>But barring that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's random walk and you know that,</v>

268
00:15:24.231 --> 00:15:25.064
<v Speaker 2>cause we played 10 monopoly games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very unlikely that you're going to </v>

269
00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:28.844
<v Speaker 2>win more than your random sharer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's think about what happens in an </v>

270
00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.193
<v Speaker 2>office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first thing that happens is you </v>

271
00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:40.601
<v Speaker 2>start from a position of equity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody has exactly the same amount of</v>

272
00:15:40.641 --> 00:15:43.640
<v Speaker 2>money and then you engage in brandon </v>
<v Speaker 2>training,</v>

273
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:45.740
<v Speaker 2>essentially chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guys,</v>

274
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:46.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

275
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:47.900
<v Speaker 2>And so what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

276
00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:50.360
<v Speaker 2>what happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so here's the graph.</v>

277
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.600
<v Speaker 2>One Bar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's number of people,</v>

278
00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.380
<v Speaker 2>or people are playing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all have exactly the same amount of</v>

279
00:15:57.381 --> 00:15:58.214
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think it's like $2,000 to begin with or </v>

280
00:15:59.451 --> 00:16:00.284
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you started shaking your ducks and </v>

281
00:16:02.301 --> 00:16:03.134
<v Speaker 2>then go starts to happen is a few people</v>
<v Speaker 2>start to granted it more and a few </v>

282
00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:07.643
<v Speaker 2>people start to lose a bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what happens to the waiters is that </v>

283
00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.510
<v Speaker 2>they become more resilient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

284
00:16:13.511 --> 00:16:17.330
<v Speaker 2>They can take more losses than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are starting to lose.</v>

285
00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:21.230
<v Speaker 2>And so what happens is the distribution </v>
<v Speaker 2>flattens out.</v>

286
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:23.870
<v Speaker 2>Couple of people get more of the word </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

287
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:28.380
<v Speaker 2>One person pulls up if the lead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people get less money and the loser</v>

288
00:16:28.381 --> 00:16:31.730
<v Speaker 2>starts to develop and you keep shaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dice as soon.</v>

289
00:16:31.731 --> 00:16:34.190
<v Speaker 2>What happens is they hang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone gives zero.</v>

290
00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:39.680
<v Speaker 2>Now zero is a terrible number and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can see this in all sorts of ways.</v>

291
00:16:39.681 --> 00:16:41.750
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're trying to start a business,</v>

292
00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:42.973
<v Speaker 2>zero customers is really the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of customers who have as way </v>

293
00:16:46.791 --> 00:16:49.910
<v Speaker 2>harder to get your first customer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to eat your second year customer,</v>

294
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.520
<v Speaker 2>you know it's way easier to get your </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred and second customer,</v>

295
00:16:52.521 --> 00:16:55.730
<v Speaker 2>then your third customer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive easier part of the guys.</v>

296
00:16:55.731 --> 00:16:56.564
<v Speaker 2>Who the hell wants to buy something from</v>
<v Speaker 2>you if you haven't sold something to </v>

297
00:16:58.431 --> 00:17:01.400
<v Speaker 2>someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know people use social proof and you</v>

298
00:17:01.401 --> 00:17:04.630
<v Speaker 2>aren't saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm new and revolutionary and they,</v>

299
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:07.270
<v Speaker 2>well that's all well and good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just so damn wait,</v>

300
00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take the risk of being </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong vibe and the product.</v>

301
00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.970
<v Speaker 2>If I'd rather people buy it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I can say,</v>

302
00:17:13.971 --> 00:17:15.350
<v Speaker 2>well these other hundred people bought </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

303
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:18.320
<v Speaker 2>So I thought it was okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a reasonable justification.</v>

304
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.930
<v Speaker 2>But otherwise they have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

305
00:17:20.931 --> 00:17:22.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have gotten the lamp and just</v>

306
00:17:22.751 --> 00:17:24.110
<v Speaker 2>a few exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

307
00:17:24.111 --> 00:17:24.944
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fire.</v>

308
00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:27.800
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so carbon is very,</v>

309
00:17:27.801 --> 00:17:28.634
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to get away from zero now</v>
<v Speaker 2>and normally it's impossible because as </v>

310
00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:32.984
<v Speaker 2>soon as you hit zero and we run into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem that you don't have when you </v>

311
00:17:36.111 --> 00:17:41.111
<v Speaker 2>even have a $20 and the problem is you </v>
<v Speaker 2>cannot invest zero to making more money.</v>

312
00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.600
<v Speaker 2>You're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Stack up at zero,</v>

313
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:45.463
<v Speaker 2>you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so zeros were off number while we </v>

314
00:17:48.351 --> 00:17:52.560
<v Speaker 2>keep playing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone walks away with all the money.</v>

315
00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.133
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been complaining about the rules </v>

316
00:17:55.201 --> 00:17:56.034
<v Speaker 2>of the game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know the funny thing is people </v>

317
00:17:57.611 --> 00:18:01.140
<v Speaker 2>will play even if they know they know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the outcome's going to be.</v>

318
00:18:01.141 --> 00:18:03.700
<v Speaker 2>One plutocrat walk away.</v>

319
00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:07.440
<v Speaker 2>We called houses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>parks here and we'll track,</v>

320
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:14.990
<v Speaker 2>but then we were watching all this is to</v>
<v Speaker 2>recast the game and play once more.</v>

321
00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:19.600
<v Speaker 2>The tables will often turn that my </v>
<v Speaker 2>client's hypothesis,</v>

322
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.750
<v Speaker 2>which I thought was very good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

323
00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.580
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens in society because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why they moved towards repletion.</v>

324
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.840
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of our society in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>

325
00:18:27.841 --> 00:18:31.670
<v Speaker 2>which is that you play on the hate </v>
<v Speaker 2>logging off.</v>

326
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:33.630
<v Speaker 2>You could assume these are random and </v>
<v Speaker 2>trading game.</v>

327
00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.360
<v Speaker 2>It's not exactly around the trading </v>
<v Speaker 2>game,</v>

328
00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:36.203
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been Martin on quite nicely at </v>

329
00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:39.510
<v Speaker 2>around three day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens is eventually,</v>

330
00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:40.373
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people have oic everything and </v>

331
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:46.580
<v Speaker 2>almost every one stacks up and zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the problem with zero is that you've</v>

332
00:18:46.681 --> 00:18:51.480
<v Speaker 2>got nothing to lose if I don't flip the </v>
<v Speaker 2>damn board over and start a new game.</v>

333
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.510
<v Speaker 2>And that's especially true if your male </v>
<v Speaker 2>as their evening.</v>

334
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:55.343
<v Speaker 2>It's true if your males,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because may all need status and the </v>

335
00:18:58.741 --> 00:19:01.800
<v Speaker 2>reason they need status is because </v>
<v Speaker 2>females don't like men with no status.</v>

336
00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:07.370
<v Speaker 2>So that's a fundamental rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the correlation between</v>

337
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:11.903
<v Speaker 2>male socioeconomic status and access to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me or is this roughly about 26 which is </v>

338
00:19:16.261 --> 00:19:17.094
<v Speaker 2>a standard guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the high correlation for the social </v>

339
00:19:19.171 --> 00:19:20.790
<v Speaker 2>sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive correlation.</v>

340
00:19:20.791 --> 00:19:21.624
<v Speaker 2>You hardly see the only correlation I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever seen higher than that as the </v>

341
00:19:24.391 --> 00:19:27.780
<v Speaker 2>relationship between inequality and male</v>
<v Speaker 2>on male homicide,</v>

342
00:19:27.781 --> 00:19:30.460
<v Speaker 2>which is about 0.8 which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes from all of them.</v>

343
00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:34.740
<v Speaker 2>So as any quality cram side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men start to kill each other and they're</v>

344
00:19:34.741 --> 00:19:38.490
<v Speaker 2>young men and the Carolina men and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it status disputes.</v>

345
00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:42.270
<v Speaker 2>And then you have within race and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

346
00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:45.630
<v Speaker 2>it's you say read to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see something,</v>

347
00:19:45.631 --> 00:19:47.660
<v Speaker 2>bring it back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to save face for,</v>

348
00:19:47.661 --> 00:19:48.494
<v Speaker 2>tried to print up a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the status soon if we're not careful </v>

349
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.520
<v Speaker 2>because we're impulsive because our </v>
<v Speaker 2>future is that right?</v>

350
00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:56.520
<v Speaker 2>We have a short time horizon all we'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>gone to certain reputation.</v>

351
00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:01.190
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's your big buddy and so you</v>
<v Speaker 2>ended up dead or maybe I ended up da,</v>

352
00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:03.030
<v Speaker 2>it's a toss up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what happens?</v>

353
00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:04.793
<v Speaker 2>You get sharp for second degree murder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not enough prosecutors to go </v>

354
00:20:08.161 --> 00:20:08.994
<v Speaker 2>after you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So company argued down to mass </v>

355
00:20:10.801 --> 00:20:13.140
<v Speaker 2>slaughter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can argue self defense.</v>

356
00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.970
<v Speaker 2>You're pointing to prison for three </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

357
00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:17.080
<v Speaker 2>He served 18 months and when you come </v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

358
00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:20.000
<v Speaker 2>no blood in one messes with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

359
00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:22.680
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a harsh economics.</v>

360
00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:23.920
<v Speaker 2>The calculation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

361
00:20:23.921 --> 00:20:26.070
<v Speaker 2>it's an effective one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

362
00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.910
<v Speaker 2>but one of the consequences of quality.</v>

363
00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:33.930
<v Speaker 2>So we did research using this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

364
00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.150
<v Speaker 2>this recalled the creative achievement </v>
<v Speaker 2>questionnaire.</v>

365
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.870
<v Speaker 2>And I developed with a student that by </v>
<v Speaker 2>name Shelly Carson,</v>

366
00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:44.370
<v Speaker 2>when our is teaching in Boston and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be done point of popular nature.</v>

367
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:47.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're thinking about creativity,</v>

368
00:20:47.951 --> 00:20:48.784
<v Speaker 2>there's two ways to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can think about creativity as a </v>

369
00:20:50.921 --> 00:20:51.754
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to be how creatively can </v>

370
00:20:54.381 --> 00:20:57.960
<v Speaker 2>you pay and that would be associated to </v>
<v Speaker 2>some degree with your Inq,</v>

371
00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:58.803
<v Speaker 2>especially if their verbal Iq and also </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this trade is big five personality </v>

372
00:21:03.101 --> 00:21:06.130
<v Speaker 2>traits don't as openness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a fundamental,</v>

373
00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:08.550
<v Speaker 2>fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep,</v>

374
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.473
<v Speaker 2>vital,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately recruited personnel on the </v>

375
00:21:10.831 --> 00:21:11.664
<v Speaker 2>tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And basically people who are creative </v>

376
00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:14.763
<v Speaker 2>are good at generating exemplars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either other category or between </v>

377
00:21:18.791 --> 00:21:22.990
<v Speaker 2>Catholics in can you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can test your creativity right back.</v>

378
00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:24.700
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually quite straight forward.</v>

379
00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:25.534
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I go out to you guys to pull out a </v>

380
00:21:26.921 --> 00:21:27.754
<v Speaker 2>piece of paper and write down his name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it says you could have that began </v>

381
00:21:30.221 --> 00:21:31.054
<v Speaker 2>with the letter s in three minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does the number of words you generated </v>

382
00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:39.190
<v Speaker 2>would be correlated with your creative </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity in about 23.4 and you think,</v>

383
00:21:39.191 --> 00:21:40.024
<v Speaker 2>well that's not very high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually that's higher than is </v>

384
00:21:41.921 --> 00:21:44.530
<v Speaker 2>generated in both the 95% social science</v>
<v Speaker 2>studies.</v>

385
00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.920
<v Speaker 2>So it's flaky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

386
00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:48.003
<v Speaker 2>small effects are just help a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective than you think for a variety </v>

387
00:21:50.501 --> 00:21:52.690
<v Speaker 2>of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Partly because of the extreme is now.</v>

388
00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.153
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I can do a bandage off if I sat </v>

389
00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:59.710
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>write down as many uses as you can for a</v>

390
00:21:59.711 --> 00:22:00.544
<v Speaker 2>brick three minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I sorted globally in terms of </v>

391
00:22:03.611 --> 00:22:04.444
<v Speaker 2>how many uses you came up with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how comparatively rare you're </v>

392
00:22:08.201 --> 00:22:12.610
<v Speaker 2>useless work compared to the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>population that was being scored.</v>

393
00:22:12.611 --> 00:22:13.020
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

394
00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:18.020
<v Speaker 2>it would have to be sensible to happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet plausible use for a brick rarity and</v>

395
00:22:19.841 --> 00:22:23.010
<v Speaker 2>fluency seem to make a lot of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitutes degree pivoted.</v>

396
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:25.450
<v Speaker 2>So that be measured for you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well but</v>

397
00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:29.390
<v Speaker 2>and that's kind of normally distributed </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

398
00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:33.010
<v Speaker 2>like intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are interested in some something else</v>

399
00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.320
<v Speaker 2>you've got straight ticket can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>defined in different ways.</v>

400
00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:38.650
<v Speaker 2>So we are interested in creative </v>
<v Speaker 2>achievement accomplishment,</v>

401
00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So not only could you think creatively,</v>

402
00:22:40.871 --> 00:22:44.560
<v Speaker 2>but you've actually produced something </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world as a consequence.</v>

403
00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:47.950
<v Speaker 2>And you can debate about which is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>better definition of creativity.</v>

404
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:48.903
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can have both definitions and </v>

405
00:22:50.921 --> 00:22:51.754
<v Speaker 2>they're useful for different purposes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we chose the greater achievement </v>

406
00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.370
<v Speaker 2>definition because that was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're curious about,</v>

407
00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:01.740
<v Speaker 2>and so what we did was we thought we </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought as many dimensions as we thought</v>

408
00:23:01.901 --> 00:23:05.770
<v Speaker 2>were reasonable in creative and so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like</v>

409
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:11.380
<v Speaker 2>dance music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>theater inventions,</v>

410
00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:12.820
<v Speaker 2>cooking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

411
00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:18.380
<v Speaker 2>no architectural innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

412
00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:21.910
<v Speaker 2>fiction writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nonfiction writing,</v>

413
00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:27.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember all 13 but you get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>picture and then we had,</v>

414
00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:28.803
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we develop an eight point scale of </v>

415
00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:31.623
<v Speaker 2>levels of achievement and we have them </v>
<v Speaker 2>generally by experts and then we rank </v>

416
00:23:35.261 --> 00:23:37.240
<v Speaker 2>order them in terms of their being </v>
<v Speaker 2>probability.</v>

417
00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.073
<v Speaker 2>So category zero bus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have don't training or talent in this </v>

418
00:23:41.801 --> 00:23:44.020
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And kind of [inaudible] was like,</v>

419
00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:49.080
<v Speaker 2>well I have an reputation and so and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>did we have people fill out the Erin and</v>

420
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.073
<v Speaker 2>we go down to the distribution and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we bought was pre don't yesterday you </v>

421
00:23:53.751 --> 00:23:55.350
<v Speaker 2>should have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was before I do a premium.</v>

422
00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.273
<v Speaker 2>Distributions were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he must've followed out and making </v>

423
00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:01.124
<v Speaker 2>the scale in some stance because </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone who's a social scientist </v>

424
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.800
<v Speaker 2>basically everything is normally </v>
<v Speaker 2>distributed.</v>

425
00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.110
<v Speaker 2>It's just wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many things.</v>

426
00:24:09.111 --> 00:24:09.944
<v Speaker 2>Our peritoneal distributed as a bring </v>
<v Speaker 2>out everything when people produce </v>

427
00:24:13.431 --> 00:24:17.120
<v Speaker 2>creatively is distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that gets really,</v>

428
00:24:17.121 --> 00:24:18.320
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

429
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:22.640
<v Speaker 2>really important because you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that shows you is that</v>

430
00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:23.623
<v Speaker 2>whatever's going on in the income </v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution doesn't just characterize </v>

431
00:24:26.691 --> 00:24:27.524
<v Speaker 2>income distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't just blame it stupidly on </v>

432
00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:35.060
<v Speaker 2>unfair social circumstance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also the case that every society,</v>

433
00:24:35.061 --> 00:24:38.480
<v Speaker 2>every study I was studying has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>peritoneal distribution of income.</v>

434
00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.990
<v Speaker 2>Now how steep it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dot varies to some degree.</v>

435
00:24:41.991 --> 00:24:44.420
<v Speaker 2>As a consequence of things like social </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy,</v>

436
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:45.463
<v Speaker 2>that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to get away from the </v>

437
00:24:46.731 --> 00:24:48.430
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With that,</v>

438
00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:50.560
<v Speaker 2>we don't know how to get away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

439
00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.830
<v Speaker 2>that's the real truth about you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know how to get away from it anyways,</v>

440
00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:54.673
<v Speaker 2>but that creative gene press here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we found was that I think it was </v>

441
00:24:57.801 --> 00:24:58.634
<v Speaker 2>60% of people had a score of zero zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they haven't done anything creative </v>

442
00:25:06.651 --> 00:25:08.680
<v Speaker 2>in any of the 13 dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

443
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:11.000
<v Speaker 2>it's not that surprised that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many of you have written the book?</v>

444
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:13.970
<v Speaker 2>Well not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you have written that,</v>

445
00:25:13.971 --> 00:25:14.804
<v Speaker 2>you certainly hit publish it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you didn't publish it and no </v>

446
00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:21.650
<v Speaker 2>boss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one really wants,</v>

447
00:25:21.651 --> 00:25:22.484
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you write the minutes and </v>

448
00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:24.673
<v Speaker 2>rejection ready first tried to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>publications like 99% I mean there's </v>

449
00:25:27.981 --> 00:25:30.650
<v Speaker 2>like a million folks accomplished a year</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I think,</v>

450
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:31.543
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like 2,500 the 10,000 copies or </v>

451
00:25:34.401 --> 00:25:36.440
<v Speaker 2>something horrible like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know it.</v>

452
00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:37.730
<v Speaker 2>Steve became,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets all the money</v>

453
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:42.330
<v Speaker 2>and this brings us to the reasons for </v>
<v Speaker 2>such thing.</v>

454
00:25:42.331 --> 00:25:45.170
<v Speaker 2>So I have a friend who's his office and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

455
00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.930
<v Speaker 2>he's not seeing his pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he does three,</v>

456
00:25:47.931 --> 00:25:48.764
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's written his the gear for Oh 20 </v>

457
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.280
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

458
00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:58.300
<v Speaker 2>has done a business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's Brendan the edge of the radical</v>

459
00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.220
<v Speaker 2>distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hasn't really hit the big time year,</v>

460
00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:06.050
<v Speaker 2>but he's pushing most level is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

461
00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:09.020
<v Speaker 2>They just start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just started like artists to start.</v>

462
00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.740
<v Speaker 2>So we talked about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we'll work it out.</v>

463
00:26:12.741 --> 00:26:16.250
<v Speaker 2>What's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why does all the money flow to like five</v>

464
00:26:16.251 --> 00:26:17.690
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

465
00:26:17.691 --> 00:26:20.390
<v Speaker 2>well think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about geographically,</v>

466
00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:21.613
<v Speaker 2>although in a strange manner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about real estate territory in </v>

467
00:26:25.491 --> 00:26:26.324
<v Speaker 2>relationship to books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then think about going from the </v>

468
00:26:28.461 --> 00:26:29.294
<v Speaker 2>airport and then think about going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the airport bookstore and then think </v>

469
00:26:32.301 --> 00:26:35.420
<v Speaker 2>about the best seller stand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

470
00:26:35.421 --> 00:26:35.961
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

471
00:26:35.961 --> 00:26:36.794
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>

472
00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:39.860
<v Speaker 2>down to 50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the top five.</v>

473
00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.970
<v Speaker 2>Everyone bought us them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then think,</v>

474
00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.760
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there isn't just one of those towns</v>

475
00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:51.690
<v Speaker 2>and that's like 70% of the selling real </v>
<v Speaker 2>estate and territory.</v>

476
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:56.550
<v Speaker 2>And it's overwhelming dominated by </v>
<v Speaker 2>person up in the left hand corner.</v>

477
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:58.530
<v Speaker 2>Is it very often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steven King,</v>

478
00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:02.760
<v Speaker 2>whose name everyone knows who's worth </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone can predict,</v>

479
00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:04.800
<v Speaker 2>makes the choice easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

480
00:27:04.801 --> 00:27:06.120
<v Speaker 2>you're preoccupied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

481
00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:07.043
<v Speaker 2>you're on a flight somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to say 10 minutes </v>

482
00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:13.190
<v Speaker 2>figuring out what you're going to read </v>
<v Speaker 2>it like the plague</v>

483
00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.700
<v Speaker 2>basis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tens of billions of doors.</v>

484
00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:21.630
<v Speaker 2>And that's how it goes for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's another example.</v>

485
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:25.050
<v Speaker 2>So click about composers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

486
00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:26.670
<v Speaker 2>it turns out though</v>

487
00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.530
<v Speaker 2>five composers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bach,</v>

488
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:32.850
<v Speaker 2>Beethoven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Mozart,</v>

489
00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:34.013
<v Speaker 2>and Haydn</v>
<v Speaker 2>proposed the worst and they talked with </v>

490
00:27:39.141 --> 00:27:44.141
<v Speaker 2>95% of the perform classical repertoire </v>
<v Speaker 2>composers DMP,</v>

491
00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:50.770
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's hard to composers [inaudible]</v>

492
00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:56.240
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have to worry about </v>
<v Speaker 2>classical music you've been listening to</v>

493
00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:59.640
<v Speaker 2>and any look at those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people's</v>

494
00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:02.343
<v Speaker 2>useful conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what'd you find out is that 5% of </v>

495
00:28:05.821 --> 00:28:09.330
<v Speaker 2>what they propose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 95% of the playtime.</v>

496
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:10.343
<v Speaker 2>So it's like hardly any composers at all</v>
<v Speaker 2>composed all the music that everyone </v>

497
00:28:15.061 --> 00:28:18.330
<v Speaker 2>listens to and God was hardly any of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>music that they can post.</v>

498
00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.860
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why.</v>

499
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:23.023
<v Speaker 2>And so when the economists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sort of thing called the matthew </v>

500
00:28:26.911 --> 00:28:30.180
<v Speaker 2>principle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an interesting nomenclature,</v>

501
00:28:30.181 --> 00:28:32.670
<v Speaker 2>it's from US stealing by Christ in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>New Testament.</v>

502
00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:38.090
<v Speaker 2>Don't think he has many economically</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them.</v>

503
00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.580
<v Speaker 2>It's a vicious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vicious said,</v>

504
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:44.680
<v Speaker 2>some very vicious things in the New </v>
<v Speaker 2>Testament,</v>

505
00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:45.533
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the things that need to </v>

506
00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:49.670
<v Speaker 2>lend some credence in my estimation is </v>
<v Speaker 2>did you pick this?</v>

507
00:28:49.671 --> 00:28:50.660
<v Speaker 2>Those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would it be</v>

508
00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:58.520
<v Speaker 2>to those who have everything more will </v>
<v Speaker 2>be given from almost nothing.</v>

509
00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:02.490
<v Speaker 2>Everything will be taken away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's the matching principle.</v>

510
00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:03.533
<v Speaker 2>That's the freedom principle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Success breeds success and that's how </v>

511
00:29:07.741 --> 00:29:11.040
<v Speaker 2>the world works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the problem with that?</v>

512
00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:17.853
<v Speaker 2>Zero you don't want to tell you too much</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a problem because it isn't like </v>

513
00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:26.280
<v Speaker 2>actually zero but it's close to zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know there was an article and yet</v>

514
00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:32.300
<v Speaker 2>some report or just started to go and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't do it.</v>

515
00:29:32.301 --> 00:29:33.880
<v Speaker 2>It's overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called like survey.</v>

516
00:29:33.881 --> 00:29:37.780
<v Speaker 2>But you surveyed a bunch of people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see what proportion of people could come</v>

517
00:29:37.781 --> 00:29:38.614
<v Speaker 2>up with $500 in an emergency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer was in shockingly low </v>

518
00:29:43.391 --> 00:29:48.060
<v Speaker 2>number of people or overextended and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have any excess bunny at CAC.</v>

519
00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:51.310
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to leave when people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

520
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:56.680
<v Speaker 2>they weren't as zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a very rough place to be law.</v>

521
00:29:56.681 --> 00:30:01.681
<v Speaker 2>You don't want people to stack up at </v>
<v Speaker 2>zero because what happens is that I,</v>

522
00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.500
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that happens is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the male violence,</v>

523
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:06.663
<v Speaker 2>let us start to call it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think young man and he status </v>

524
00:30:11.801 --> 00:30:13.240
<v Speaker 2>that they also need opportunity.</v>

525
00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.860
<v Speaker 2>They also need something to aim for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

526
00:30:14.861 --> 00:30:15.694
<v Speaker 2>They need all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they're in a place where the </v>

527
00:30:17.111 --> 00:30:19.900
<v Speaker 2>inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever any three steam,</v>

528
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:22.990
<v Speaker 2>it gets hard for them to move out of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero position.</v>

529
00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:23.973
<v Speaker 2>And the district to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something to do it by any needs </v>

530
00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:26.853
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what seems to happen is that as </v>

531
00:30:28.931 --> 00:30:29.764
<v Speaker 2>society becomes more and more on equal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pressure on young women and girls </v>

532
00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:37.000
<v Speaker 2>and you can pageant well what sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>young men and becomes viable the first,</v>

533
00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:39.100
<v Speaker 2>and this is where you can have it up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other,</v>

534
00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:41.920
<v Speaker 2>what would you call them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Variables that predict violence.</v>

535
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:46.210
<v Speaker 2>Maybe impulsive guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the guy who drinks too much,</v>

536
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:47.143
<v Speaker 2>take it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy who was fond of swarm him </v>

537
00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:49.113
<v Speaker 2>against the wall three or four times </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was drunk when he was three and </v>

538
00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:53.530
<v Speaker 2>damaged his brain.</v>

539
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:54.663
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody who's impulsive and liable to </v>

540
00:30:57.041 --> 00:30:58.180
<v Speaker 2>his self,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the future,</v>

541
00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:01.780
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to be even more hyper </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivated by in hopes of violence.</v>

542
00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:02.793
<v Speaker 2>As adults,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can call the client and they are </v>

543
00:31:04.661 --> 00:31:07.470
<v Speaker 2>applying here and I'll be speaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got,</v>

544
00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:08.523
<v Speaker 2>like if you go back 80 95 you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in age 95 the average person in the </v>

545
00:31:12.341 --> 00:31:13.174
<v Speaker 2>western world lived on $1 a day and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to take while the calder fucking </v>

546
00:31:17.501 --> 00:31:18.790
<v Speaker 2>warrant more back then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

547
00:31:18.791 --> 00:31:19.360
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

548
00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:23.800
<v Speaker 2>today's dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But back then everyone had nothing thing</v>

549
00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:24.723
<v Speaker 2>and have a few people have some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can arrange that then didn't </v>

550
00:31:27.611 --> 00:31:32.611
<v Speaker 2>live like any of you live now you've got</v>
<v Speaker 2>running water.</v>

551
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:36.990
<v Speaker 2>If you've got central eating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got rely on shelter,</v>

552
00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:40.790
<v Speaker 2>you've got an infinite amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>information at your fingertips had every</v>

553
00:31:40.791 --> 00:31:44.800
<v Speaker 2>moment it's like you're filthy rich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are filthy rich.</v>

554
00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:46.533
<v Speaker 2>Money has bought everything that you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>have except sas because that's </v>

555
00:31:49.691 --> 00:31:51.400
<v Speaker 2>comparitor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

556
00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:52.293
<v Speaker 2>but the good thing to know because</v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise he might think of yourself as </v>

557
00:31:56.231 --> 00:31:59.290
<v Speaker 2>poor and if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might be relatively core</v>

558
00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:02.223
<v Speaker 2>but usually means you have to wait three</v>
<v Speaker 2>years to get the thing that the rich </v>

559
00:32:04.241 --> 00:32:05.074
<v Speaker 2>guys have now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's just not that big of a </v>

560
00:32:06.861 --> 00:32:10.210
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways.</v>

561
00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:11.133
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you is followed with societies with </v>

562
00:32:14.711 --> 00:32:15.544
<v Speaker 2>regards to creative products tend to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tilt so that people stack up at the low </v>

563
00:32:20.061 --> 00:32:23.530
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you people start up idea and then</v>

564
00:32:23.531 --> 00:32:26.590
<v Speaker 2>things start to be stabilized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the big problem.</v>

565
00:32:26.591 --> 00:32:29.810
<v Speaker 2>So like I tried this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bought this,</v>

566
00:32:29.811 --> 00:32:30.644
<v Speaker 2>this was swell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Societies run out there haven't been </v>

567
00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:33.453
<v Speaker 2>trading game until it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people have zero and a few people </v>

568
00:32:35.351 --> 00:32:37.770
<v Speaker 2>have everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the revolution comes in.</v>

569
00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:38.860
<v Speaker 2>The board selected.</v>

570
00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.320
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wants to start it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

571
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:42.730
<v Speaker 2>So I'm assuming that if there's anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>left in the wrong,</v>

572
00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:46.880
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a Marxist flavor to that.</v>

573
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:51.950
<v Speaker 2>And of course mark's pointed out that </v>
<v Speaker 2>capital candidate to accumulate,</v>

574
00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:54.800
<v Speaker 2>enhance with fewer and fewer people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing he got wrong,</v>

575
00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.510
<v Speaker 2>and this is an important thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>

576
00:32:56.511 --> 00:32:59.440
<v Speaker 2>is that although there is the 1% and </v>
<v Speaker 2>even born,</v>

577
00:32:59.441 --> 00:33:00.274
<v Speaker 2>it was the one 10th of 1% who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost all the resources that the 1% </v>

578
00:33:03.381 --> 00:33:04.520
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

579
00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.070
<v Speaker 2>They that exists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's always there,</v>

580
00:33:07.071 --> 00:33:09.080
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the same people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

581
00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:11.180
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things mark's got </v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously draw.</v>

582
00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:12.043
<v Speaker 2>It's not the same people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most family fortunes only not for three </v>

583
00:33:14.061 --> 00:33:15.410
<v Speaker 2>generations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

584
00:33:15.411 --> 00:33:18.320
<v Speaker 2>Because I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys should have money sometimes.</v>

585
00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:19.280
<v Speaker 2>Did you keep it?</v>

586
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:24.860
<v Speaker 2>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I the other people is it?</v>

587
00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:30.100
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] all the way.</v>

588
00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:31.653
<v Speaker 2>We're willing to Dole it out with just </v>
<v Speaker 2>that quickly because you have a lot of </v>

589
00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:36.470
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just spent large homes,</v>

590
00:33:36.471 --> 00:33:37.304
<v Speaker 2>money equally stupidly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And let's for somebody who really knows </v>

591
00:33:39.531 --> 00:33:40.364
<v Speaker 2>how to deal with money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people are really quite rare and </v>

592
00:33:42.621 --> 00:33:43.454
<v Speaker 2>so family fortunes dispersed and very </v>
<v Speaker 2>rapidly and the typical fortune 500 </v>

593
00:33:46.821 --> 00:33:48.770
<v Speaker 2>company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you only got us about 30 years.</v>

594
00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:53.680
<v Speaker 2>So although the distribution is the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I describe it,</v>

595
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:57.350
<v Speaker 2>the constituent elements of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution turnover quite rapidly.</v>

596
00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:00.420
<v Speaker 2>So I think if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

597
00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:05.110
<v Speaker 2>I think you'll have a 10% chance of </v>
<v Speaker 2>always that healthy stuff.</v>

598
00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:10.190
<v Speaker 2>I think you have a 10% chance of being </v>
<v Speaker 2>top 1% for a piece,</v>

599
00:34:10.191 --> 00:34:11.024
<v Speaker 2>one year of your life on average and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>40% chance of being in a top 10% for at </v>

600
00:34:15.651 --> 00:34:17.330
<v Speaker 2>least one year on average.</v>

601
00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.970
<v Speaker 2>So we know when people move up and down </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout the life of,</v>

602
00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:20.903
<v Speaker 2>another thing to keep in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very important and no one ever </v>

603
00:34:23.211 --> 00:34:24.044
<v Speaker 2>talks about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that most of the reason that people </v>

604
00:34:26.991 --> 00:34:27.824
<v Speaker 2>have money and said they're all right </v>
<v Speaker 2>because young people don't have any </v>

605
00:34:30.111 --> 00:34:30.944
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're young or old people and </v>

606
00:34:32.631 --> 00:34:33.464
<v Speaker 2>we're waiting on in particular cause all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the alternate don't have over and have </v>

607
00:34:35.691 --> 00:34:39.200
<v Speaker 2>most of the money right now because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>old man dies conveniently.</v>

608
00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:43.090
<v Speaker 2>And</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you know the problem that people,</v>

609
00:34:43.091 --> 00:34:43.924
<v Speaker 2>all my that role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so just the typical overs as me to </v>

610
00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.310
<v Speaker 2>take credit me on the court and he got </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be,</v>

611
00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:51.860
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes you could think about that yourself.</v>

612
00:34:51.861 --> 00:34:52.910
<v Speaker 2>If you're young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

613
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.900
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're now $20 million from afternoon 85</v>

614
00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:59.330
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you gonna take?</v>

615
00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:00.861
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

616
00:35:00.861 --> 00:35:03.140
<v Speaker 2>to some degree it depends on how you </v>
<v Speaker 2>calculate.</v>

617
00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:04.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

618
00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:05.870
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

619
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:07.940
<v Speaker 2>so what's the point of all of that?</v>

620
00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:15.770
<v Speaker 2>It all keeps us and it's actually a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental problem.</v>

621
00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:19.070
<v Speaker 2>And even if you're a conservative </v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

622
00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:20.660
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

623
00:35:20.661 --> 00:35:21.494
<v Speaker 2>it's a fundamental problem because at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the inequality gets out of Canada to </v>

624
00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:26.720
<v Speaker 2>Valerie and society starts cause you </v>
<v Speaker 2>stabilize.</v>

625
00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:29.350
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that conservatives,</v>

626
00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.193
<v Speaker 2>Republicans say they're a cop on crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Progressive Conservatives for that </v>

627
00:35:33.171 --> 00:35:34.420
<v Speaker 2>matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how dry.</v>

628
00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:36.500
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what drives the risk by your crime?</v>

629
00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:40.110
<v Speaker 2>They all are final homocide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say we know what it is.</v>

630
00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:42.120
<v Speaker 2>It's inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The correlation is,</v>

631
00:35:42.121 --> 00:35:43.160
<v Speaker 2>like I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gate,</v>

632
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:44.930
<v Speaker 2>it's all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all of it.</v>

633
00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:47.070
<v Speaker 2>That's what drives the status </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition.</v>

634
00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:50.400
<v Speaker 2>And just interviewed Dr. Martin Daly </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>

635
00:35:50.401 --> 00:35:52.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's evolutionary psychologist,</v>

636
00:35:52.441 --> 00:35:56.310
<v Speaker 2>staff mcmaster that being from this </v>
<v Speaker 2>place and</v>

637
00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:58.870
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

638
00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:01.140
<v Speaker 2>he didn't know the Brown works with this</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of research.</v>

639
00:36:01.141 --> 00:36:04.670
<v Speaker 2>So I've been re released that in one </v>
<v Speaker 2>week and he wrote a book recently called</v>

640
00:36:04.671 --> 00:36:06.900
<v Speaker 2>the killing to competition is very high </v>
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

641
00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:08.880
<v Speaker 2>He talks about being on the 11th it </v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

642
00:36:08.881 --> 00:36:13.140
<v Speaker 2>a rational strategy for uncertain </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment where there's a lot of chaos</v>

643
00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:15.630
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of equality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's worth reading.</v>

644
00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:18.840
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's very strongly biological,</v>

645
00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:21.390
<v Speaker 2>biologically oriented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evolutionary psychologists,</v>

646
00:36:21.391 --> 00:36:22.051
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very highly.</v>

647
00:36:22.051 --> 00:36:23.340
<v Speaker 2>Incredibly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My estimation,</v>

648
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:24.623
<v Speaker 2>but last two chapters deal with social </v>
<v Speaker 2>contributors to inequality and I don't </v>

649
00:36:30.811 --> 00:36:31.644
<v Speaker 2>think that that is separately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very powerful part of this book </v>

650
00:36:33.241 --> 00:36:35.640
<v Speaker 2>because I don't think it deals with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental issue.</v>

651
00:36:35.641 --> 00:36:37.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to tell him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I'm the medical issue.</v>

652
00:36:37.231 --> 00:36:40.440
<v Speaker 2>If there's something going on here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a natural law.</v>

653
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:42.080
<v Speaker 2>There's producers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's wide disparity,</v>

654
00:36:42.081 --> 00:36:42.914
<v Speaker 2>has an outcome.</v>

655
00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:45.930
<v Speaker 2>Now the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

656
00:36:45.931 --> 00:36:48.660
<v Speaker 2>what should we do about it and answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it nothing?</v>

657
00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:50.550
<v Speaker 2>Because if you let her drive him to his </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusion,</v>

658
00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:53.670
<v Speaker 2>then all hell breaks loose and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you're rich,</v>

659
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:54.520
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

660
00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.160
<v Speaker 2>you're and you're down in Central </v>
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>

661
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.950
<v Speaker 2>even in Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to be rich in Columbia?</v>

662
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.450
<v Speaker 2>Well Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to.</v>

663
00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:04.740
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to go outside instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside the confines of your compound.</v>

664
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:07.160
<v Speaker 2>You're in a Ga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>

665
00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:10.680
<v Speaker 2>You know you're going to people in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>computers for family,</v>

666
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:13.500
<v Speaker 2>but fundamentally this jail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a huge house.</v>

667
00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:15.690
<v Speaker 2>Hooray.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More clean as far as like</v>

668
00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:18.733
<v Speaker 2>a fence around the barb wire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got guards everywhere and can </v>

669
00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:24.040
<v Speaker 2>help your kids having to go out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get kidnapped.</v>

670
00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:25.530
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you rich?</v>

671
00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

672
00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:29.530
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been Montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was poor.</v>

673
00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:30.660
<v Speaker 2>You're speaking.</v>

674
00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:32.160
<v Speaker 2>I just have a students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

675
00:37:32.161 --> 00:37:32.994
<v Speaker 2>students up a site map and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>spend much time in my heart because I </v>

676
00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:40.080
<v Speaker 2>wasn't looking place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Montreal,</v>

677
00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:41.460
<v Speaker 2>peaceful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

678
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:43.650
<v Speaker 2>Great infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great streets,</v>

679
00:37:43.651 --> 00:37:45.060
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're safe.</v>

680
00:37:45.061 --> 00:37:47.550
<v Speaker 2>There were three in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go anywhere in the city.</v>

681
00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:48.473
<v Speaker 2>There's always something going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Often experiental cost public </v>

682
00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.000
<v Speaker 2>essentially like in many European </v>
<v Speaker 2>cities.</v>

683
00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:55.770
<v Speaker 2>Hell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're rich.</v>

684
00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:57.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason you're reaching under</v>

685
00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:01.560
<v Speaker 2>circumstances like that is because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>inequality hasn't gotten out of control.</v>

686
00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:03.203
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to figure out how to define </v>

687
00:38:04.351 --> 00:38:05.184
<v Speaker 2>wealth too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because wealth is not just what you </v>

688
00:38:06.661 --> 00:38:07.890
<v Speaker 2>happen to possess.</v>

689
00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:14.890
<v Speaker 2>That might be sas and status is useful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but status and wealth,</v>

690
00:38:14.891 --> 00:38:17.430
<v Speaker 2>they're not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

691
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:20.760
<v Speaker 2>so now the issue is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

692
00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.313
<v Speaker 2>there's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is in quality goods are </v>

693
00:38:24.811 --> 00:38:27.270
<v Speaker 2>unequally distributed and that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>fair.</v>

694
00:38:27.271 --> 00:38:29.580
<v Speaker 2>You know those additional problems that </v>
<v Speaker 2>go along with that.</v>

695
00:38:29.581 --> 00:38:34.130
<v Speaker 2>Because one problem is is that if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen to be in the top 1%,</v>

696
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:35.143
<v Speaker 2>it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your check is your from your children's </v>

697
00:38:36.791 --> 00:38:39.300
<v Speaker 2>who also quite off the socioeconomic </v>
<v Speaker 2>live.</v>

698
00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:40.473
<v Speaker 2>Now it's not as easy as people think and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a reasonable probability that </v>

699
00:38:44.291 --> 00:38:48.730
<v Speaker 2>you'll fall and some of it is actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>due to intelligence because it turns out</v>

700
00:38:48.731 --> 00:38:52.900
<v Speaker 2>that on average intelligence people have</v>
<v Speaker 2>more money than unintelligent people,</v>

701
00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:53.763
<v Speaker 2>which hard becomes a surprise and </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientious people have more money </v>

702
00:38:56.561 --> 00:39:00.190
<v Speaker 2>than I'm conscientious people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which also hardly comes as a surprise.</v>

703
00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.450
<v Speaker 2>And if you haven't become as your </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents and you're more likely,</v>

704
00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:06.670
<v Speaker 2>if you can tell yourself not as </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent as them,</v>

705
00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:07.713
<v Speaker 2>cause you addressed to the me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even even the unequal distribution of </v>

706
00:39:10.631 --> 00:39:13.750
<v Speaker 2>intelligence sorts itself out across </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

707
00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:15.363
<v Speaker 2>But you show up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still have what you might describe </v>

708
00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:19.930
<v Speaker 2>as a technically unfair advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

709
00:39:19.931 --> 00:39:20.764
<v Speaker 2>so you've got a distribution problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to technically unfair </v>

710
00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:24.243
<v Speaker 2>opportunity problem and it's reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 2>to point those up and that's what the </v>

711
00:39:28.751 --> 00:39:30.910
<v Speaker 2>left does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

712
00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:33.850
<v Speaker 2>That's what the leftover food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's functioning properly.</v>

713
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:35.170
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

714
00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:36.790
<v Speaker 2>we've got to keep the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

715
00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:37.643
<v Speaker 2>quality the Gini Coefficient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you're got to give you the </v>

716
00:39:40.171 --> 00:39:42.010
<v Speaker 2>call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He flattened out because we won't have a</v>

717
00:39:42.011 --> 00:39:42.844
<v Speaker 2>civil society without it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we'll meet people at the blog who </v>

718
00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:49.070
<v Speaker 2>could be productive and useful and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>will get an opportunity and then we will</v>

719
00:39:49.071 --> 00:39:51.790
<v Speaker 2>get to enjoy all the cool things they </v>
<v Speaker 2>might have made were invented.</v>

720
00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:53.200
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I'm,</v>

721
00:39:53.201 --> 00:39:54.880
<v Speaker 2>that's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

722
00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:56.440
<v Speaker 2>when people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

723
00:39:56.441 --> 00:39:58.720
<v Speaker 2>but if you flatten out the damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution too much,</v>

724
00:39:58.721 --> 00:40:02.140
<v Speaker 2>then you remove people's incentives and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to do that too much.</v>

725
00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:03.100
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

726
00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:04.750
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>

727
00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:09.010
<v Speaker 2>So you've got truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a truth be and o questionnaire as well,</v>

728
00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:11.280
<v Speaker 2>which true ratings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

729
00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:13.093
<v Speaker 2>Well that brings us to the next one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to talk to some things </v>

730
00:40:17.201 --> 00:40:18.034
<v Speaker 2>about right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's what I'm going to tell you </v>

731
00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:22.080
<v Speaker 2>some things about last week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing I'm going to do is to</v>

732
00:40:22.081 --> 00:40:26.830
<v Speaker 2>tell you about why people are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we've even,</v>

733
00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:30.670
<v Speaker 2>and other labs [inaudible] labs first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

734
00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:31.853
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you investigated the relationship </v>

735
00:40:33.191 --> 00:40:35.150
<v Speaker 2>between the fundamental biological </v>
<v Speaker 2>tempered,</v>

736
00:40:35.151 --> 00:40:38.890
<v Speaker 2>what's included intelligence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>political?</v>

737
00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:39.923
<v Speaker 2>That's called a viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's better to get an opinion or </v>

738
00:40:42.461 --> 00:40:44.440
<v Speaker 2>attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of a viewpoint.</v>

739
00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:45.563
<v Speaker 2>It gives you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

740
00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:46.563
<v Speaker 2>when you guys look at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't see the world and just see </v>

741
00:40:48.941 --> 00:40:52.570
<v Speaker 2>that tiny little fragment of the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you find valuable,</v>

742
00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If a rose to complicate it,</v>

743
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:58.810
<v Speaker 2>and I can know how many of you have seen</v>
<v Speaker 2>the famous invisible gorilla video,</v>

744
00:40:58.811 --> 00:40:59.644
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of people playing </v>

745
00:41:01.751 --> 00:41:05.800
<v Speaker 2>basketball team 0.3 of them wanting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I craved them,</v>

746
00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:08.050
<v Speaker 2>it has the bouncing balls back and forth</v>
<v Speaker 2>between them.</v>

747
00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:11.410
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to count the number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>times the way t passes basketball.</v>

748
00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:13.250
<v Speaker 2>They feel a visual screen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>

749
00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.620
<v Speaker 2>these six people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're dense around this.</v>

750
00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:17.620
<v Speaker 2>The best of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're counting,</v>

751
00:41:17.621 --> 00:41:18.940
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're pretty damn smart.</v>

752
00:41:18.941 --> 00:41:20.120
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can count</v>

753
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000
<v Speaker 2>stands the screen and beats his chest </v>
<v Speaker 2>for like 15 seconds and says songs off.</v>

754
00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:30.183
<v Speaker 2>And then the experimenter baskets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did you notice anything strange and </v>

755
00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:35.210
<v Speaker 2>was saying no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>

756
00:41:35.211 --> 00:41:36.890
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many passes did you say?</v>

757
00:41:36.891 --> 00:41:38.380
<v Speaker 2>16 and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

758
00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:42.020
<v Speaker 2>and then he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you see the gorilla?</v>

759
00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:43.270
<v Speaker 2>And he'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are luck?</v>

760
00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:45.030
<v Speaker 2>Or talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say what her role.</v>

761
00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:46.243
<v Speaker 2>And so then you rerun the tape and sure </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough quick power palatable ran </v>

762
00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:52.670
<v Speaker 2>hundreds girl right in the of the screen</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are just not very bright.</v>

763
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:55.303
<v Speaker 2>Three blind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are so large and the points were so </v>

764
00:41:58.281 --> 00:41:58.640
<v Speaker 2>mine.</v>

765
00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:02.780
<v Speaker 2>It's so focused in know we're kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a panel on a piece of paper.</v>

766
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:07.790
<v Speaker 2>You know human consciousness is likable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ball point portal that Canon,</v>

767
00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:10.550
<v Speaker 2>it's writing but it's just barely making</v>
<v Speaker 2>contact.</v>

768
00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:12.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's enough to write and move on,</v>

769
00:42:12.651 --> 00:42:13.484
<v Speaker 2>which is not trivial but that's how </v>
<v Speaker 2>focused we are and we're focused on the </v>

770
00:42:16.911 --> 00:42:19.290
<v Speaker 2>things that we find before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then question,</v>

771
00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:21.900
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't we find the things we find the</v>

772
00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:22.813
<v Speaker 2>portal and pardon and ask her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means at least in part Kimber </v>

773
00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:29.750
<v Speaker 2>kimber filters for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

774
00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:31.340
<v Speaker 2>an example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're high in openness,</v>

775
00:42:31.341 --> 00:42:33.640
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be attracted to duty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be attracted.</v>

776
00:42:33.641 --> 00:42:35.240
<v Speaker 2>Hispanics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could he trapped with ideas?</v>

777
00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:36.163
<v Speaker 2>If you're an extrovert and it's like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole world is a part of it and you're </v>

778
00:42:38.121 --> 00:42:38.954
<v Speaker 2>the entertainment if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their audit is like key things that are </v>

779
00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:45.230
<v Speaker 2>game away from him cause you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreeable.</v>

780
00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:47.600
<v Speaker 2>It's relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to take care of things,</v>

781
00:42:47.601 --> 00:42:50.360
<v Speaker 2>you want a formal relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're conscientious,</v>

782
00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:51.313
<v Speaker 2>it's like an eagle lake view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a heat away due to the relative </v>

783
00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:57.880
<v Speaker 2>industries orderly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then not only did they,</v>

784
00:42:57.890 --> 00:43:02.510
<v Speaker 2>does that cover your attitudes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also filters things for you.</v>

785
00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:05.300
<v Speaker 2>So you see the world through your </v>
<v Speaker 2>temperament.</v>

786
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:08.060
<v Speaker 2>You can filter news through your </v>
<v Speaker 2>temperament,</v>

787
00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:09.093
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so well part of that is because </v>

788
00:43:11.301 --> 00:43:13.070
<v Speaker 2>there's different niches in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

789
00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:13.933
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're an entertainer is when </v>

790
00:43:14.631 --> 00:43:15.464
<v Speaker 2>people like to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're part of the city you can be </v>

791
00:43:17.061 --> 00:43:17.894
<v Speaker 2>relied on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when people ask you to help them </v>

792
00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:20.600
<v Speaker 2>move,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the going from,</v>

793
00:43:20.830 --> 00:43:22.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you were agreeable.</v>

794
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:23.833
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone needs to have a talk about </v>

795
00:43:25.251 --> 00:43:27.020
<v Speaker 2>something that's bothering them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're there,</v>

796
00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:30.500
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're disagreeable or there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone wants to blunt truth,</v>

797
00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:32.060
<v Speaker 2>then you'll come and talk to you.</v>

798
00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:33.133
<v Speaker 2>And so these are all places that you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>fit in the social structure and in the </v>

799
00:43:36.171 --> 00:43:38.770
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's where I lose that 30 again,</v>

800
00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more power to it.</v>

801
00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:45.490
<v Speaker 2>It's great people come equipped in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world with different tools and the tools</v>

802
00:43:45.711 --> 00:43:48.470
<v Speaker 2>allow them to do different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what diversity is.</v>

803
00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:49.513
<v Speaker 2>It's real diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that idiot diversity that was </v>

804
00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:57.340
<v Speaker 2>showing us</v>
<v Speaker 2>right in place of real diversity.</v>

805
00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:00.220
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so are your,</v>

806
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:04.150
<v Speaker 2>the way you are now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know Tara is high character,</v>

807
00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:06.380
<v Speaker 2>you know it can be both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

808
00:44:06.381 --> 00:44:08.990
<v Speaker 2>if you have a child who's high in </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroticism,</v>

809
00:44:08.991 --> 00:44:09.824
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can tell if you have a child </v>

810
00:44:11.291 --> 00:44:14.600
<v Speaker 2>left out because there more fussy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to calm them down.</v>

811
00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:17.540
<v Speaker 2>They started or easily to a noise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're more,</v>

812
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:20.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in more cautious of strangers.</v>

813
00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:22.313
<v Speaker 2>If something new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the famous study by drove the get use </v>

814
00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:27.410
<v Speaker 2>robots to test kids.</v>

815
00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:31.160
<v Speaker 2>See how they describe it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Precisely.</v>

816
00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:36.270
<v Speaker 2>He wrote all of a sudden Ronnie in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>room with these reflect to your rules,</v>

817
00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:40.820
<v Speaker 2>maybe wave line slash sheet and somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>can use the extra virgin.</v>

818
00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:44.330
<v Speaker 2>Not at all my courses and just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

819
00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:47.990
<v Speaker 2>interact with the devil and the more </v>
<v Speaker 2>timid ones with hard to be heard.</v>

820
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.700
<v Speaker 2>Your parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mothers,</v>

821
00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:53.123
<v Speaker 2>no man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was adamant as early a six </v>

822
00:44:55.021 --> 00:44:55.854
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what Kagan found was that if the </v>

823
00:44:59.221 --> 00:45:00.054
<v Speaker 2>people who have what he called inhibited</v>
<v Speaker 2>children were diligent in encouraging </v>

824
00:45:05.131 --> 00:45:05.964
<v Speaker 2>them to get out and explore the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that their level of negative emotion </v>

825
00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:13.740
<v Speaker 2>could move towards normalization over a </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of years.</v>

826
00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:17.370
<v Speaker 2>But they never became truly fearless </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

827
00:45:17.371 --> 00:45:18.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could modify.</v>

828
00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:20.970
<v Speaker 2>And of course if you have a kid like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and you miss,</v>

829
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.150
<v Speaker 2>treat them and make the regarding to </v>
<v Speaker 2>very uncertain and you take away all the</v>

830
00:45:24.151 --> 00:45:24.984
<v Speaker 2>security from them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can turn them into a complete </v>

831
00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:30.240
<v Speaker 2>neurotic wreck and they'll never </v>
<v Speaker 2>recover.</v>

832
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:31.650
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

833
00:45:31.651 --> 00:45:34.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same applies for extroversion and at</v>

834
00:45:34.141 --> 00:45:36.770
<v Speaker 2>the same applies for conscientiousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>and agreeableness.</v>

835
00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:39.450
<v Speaker 2>These things are deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply rooted in people.</v>

836
00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:41.040
<v Speaker 2>Now you can move them around to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree,</v>

837
00:45:41.041 --> 00:45:42.960
<v Speaker 2>but first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you,</v>

838
00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:46.230
<v Speaker 2>except maybe it's nice to have a kid </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling more emotionally stable.</v>

839
00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:51.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's okay if that diversity exists and</v>

840
00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:57.150
<v Speaker 2>it's useful to know that it can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>easily automated.</v>

841
00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:59.420
<v Speaker 2>That's part of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason that's useful to know if,</v>

842
00:45:59.421 --> 00:46:01.910
<v Speaker 2>because one of the things that you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to know,</v>

843
00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:02.753
<v Speaker 2>if you want to be successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>find a damn job that suits your </v>

844
00:46:04.891 --> 00:46:05.724
<v Speaker 2>cameraman because it's easier than </v>
<v Speaker 2>changing their temperament to suit the </v>

845
00:46:09.211 --> 00:46:10.044
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're is meredith and I had made </v>

846
00:46:12.191 --> 00:46:15.270
<v Speaker 2>the commotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say say owes no problem.</v>

847
00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:19.050
<v Speaker 2>And if you're like our radical </v>
<v Speaker 2>extroverts,</v>

848
00:46:19.051 --> 00:46:21.330
<v Speaker 2>like computer programming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably not.</v>

849
00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:22.433
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be the guy who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>wandering around chatting to all the </v>

850
00:46:24.631 --> 00:46:26.770
<v Speaker 2>other programmers and annoying the hell </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of them.</v>

851
00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:27.633
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're introverted and they can be </v>

852
00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:29.323
<v Speaker 2>conscientious as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to do is be alone in the </v>

853
00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:35.160
<v Speaker 2>border until go away like joe you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

854
00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.640
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so back to holy text.</v>

855
00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:40.073
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns out that temperament predicts </v>

856
00:46:41.101 --> 00:46:46.101
<v Speaker 2>political belief very nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now at the level of only predicting,</v>

857
00:46:47.311 --> 00:46:49.470
<v Speaker 2>say party affiliation or voting </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>

858
00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:52.840
<v Speaker 2>you can give up 10% of the various </v>
<v Speaker 2>political weight,</v>

859
00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:56.610
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't sound like much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just lansing to throw the election,</v>

860
00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:58.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you know the hinge on time,</v>

861
00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:59.703
<v Speaker 2>90 markets the best presses up the u s </v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you do a detailed analysis of </v>

862
00:47:03.211 --> 00:47:04.044
<v Speaker 2>people's political beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you differentiate how much farther </v>

863
00:47:06.751 --> 00:47:11.751
<v Speaker 2>than you you're voting behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get like 30% of the variance.</v>

864
00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:12.623
<v Speaker 2>It starts to get to viciously powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful enough to make the assumption </v>

865
00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:17.583
<v Speaker 2>that the primary determinant of </v>
<v Speaker 2>political belief is temporal and the </v>

866
00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:21.293
<v Speaker 2>primary each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cameraman is biology and so you're </v>

867
00:47:23.671 --> 00:47:28.671
<v Speaker 2>biologically pre disposed to be whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>card you are.</v>

868
00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:30.550
<v Speaker 2>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

869
00:47:30.551 --> 00:47:34.810
<v Speaker 2>what about the well known where young </v>
<v Speaker 2>people tend to be more liberal,</v>

870
00:47:34.811 --> 00:47:35.644
<v Speaker 2>less bleeding in young people or do </v>
<v Speaker 2>people tend to be in a more </v>

871
00:47:38.051 --> 00:47:40.150
<v Speaker 2>conservative?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of the reason for that is if people</v>

872
00:47:40.151 --> 00:47:44.550
<v Speaker 2>get more conscientious as they age and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so that it doesn't destroy it up.</v>

873
00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:47.810
<v Speaker 2>I bought the system at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the reason that's useful to know,</v>

874
00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:48.810
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

875
00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:52.270
<v Speaker 2>if you're aware laughy and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to someone who's right way,</v>

876
00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:55.750
<v Speaker 2>you're not just talking to some blind 88</v>
<v Speaker 2>you to see the obvious truth.</v>

877
00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:56.853
<v Speaker 2>You're talking to someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>different than you and there's reasons </v>

878
00:47:59.711 --> 00:48:02.680
<v Speaker 2>that they're given.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It happens at different niche and occupy</v>

879
00:48:02.681 --> 00:48:04.540
<v Speaker 2>a different edge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a real niche.</v>

880
00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:07.030
<v Speaker 2>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's an example.</v>

881
00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:11.500
<v Speaker 2>Are you trying to predict </v>
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurial behavior for a long time</v>

882
00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:16.450
<v Speaker 2>learned to do it or it's successful and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's nor obvious who entrepreneurs are?</v>

883
00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:20.640
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are they the same as executives?</v>

884
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:23.200
<v Speaker 2>They say there's managers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have to say is an industry,</v>

885
00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:27.310
<v Speaker 2>is it the same as your first two </v>
<v Speaker 2>professors are artists?</v>

886
00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:29.740
<v Speaker 2>None of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all true though.</v>

887
00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:30.603
<v Speaker 2>They're the same as ours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why don't you drivers are creative </v>

888
00:48:33.311 --> 00:48:35.320
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're high in openness.</v>

889
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:39.000
<v Speaker 2>Now what that means is they're pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>damn good at coming up with eye gaze and</v>

890
00:48:39.001 --> 00:48:41.830
<v Speaker 2>moving sideways and reading inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause if they have to,</v>

891
00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:44.770
<v Speaker 2>but they generally aren't very good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

892
00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:47.260
<v Speaker 2>Everyone companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you want to run?</v>

893
00:48:47.261 --> 00:48:50.900
<v Speaker 2>The company is someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientious and conscientious people.</v>

894
00:48:50.901 --> 00:48:53.830
<v Speaker 2>They'll do what they're supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they know what it is,</v>

895
00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:57.760
<v Speaker 2>they're not jumping all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to track to walk out.</v>

896
00:48:58.130 --> 00:48:58.963
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you have someone installing gas </v>

897
00:49:00.131 --> 00:49:04.150
<v Speaker 2>pipes where there's not supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>any leaks cause otherwise they explode.</v>

898
00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:08.260
<v Speaker 2>You want some obsessive conscientious </v>
<v Speaker 2>got who wants to get with exactly right.</v>

899
00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:10.810
<v Speaker 2>You don't want some Korean guy who wants</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make like a coach</v>

900
00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:16.990
<v Speaker 2>consultant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Entrepreneurs are afraid of him.</v>

901
00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:21.170
<v Speaker 2>They're liberals and the managers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>administrators on the conservative yet.</v>

902
00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:22.413
<v Speaker 2>And so you need liberal place to start </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies to be creative and you need </v>

903
00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:32.380
<v Speaker 2>conservative types to run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's kind kinda nice.</v>

904
00:49:32.381 --> 00:49:35.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many creative types need compared to</v>

905
00:49:35.201 --> 00:49:36.034
<v Speaker 2>how big managerial types has the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem as how many fingers do you need </v>

906
00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:40.563
<v Speaker 2>in the political sphere versus how many </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatives and actually conveys it </v>

907
00:49:44.111 --> 00:49:46.720
<v Speaker 2>depends on circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

908
00:49:46.721 --> 00:49:50.530
<v Speaker 2>so now we'll go into more deeply.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So heres the predictors,</v>

909
00:49:50.531 --> 00:49:53.230
<v Speaker 2>the fundamental predictors of political </v>
<v Speaker 2>belief up.</v>

910
00:49:53.310 --> 00:49:56.290
<v Speaker 2>Just a little conservative for now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say that just left and right.</v>

911
00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:58.480
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you about the flooding from </v>
<v Speaker 2>prep types of,</v>

912
00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:02.380
<v Speaker 2>but we'll just say the conventional left</v>
<v Speaker 2>to right distribution,</v>

913
00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:07.690
<v Speaker 2>the right waivers are low in openness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the creativity dimension,</v>

914
00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:10.000
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't think of very many uses for a</v>

915
00:50:10.001 --> 00:50:11.470
<v Speaker 2>break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you ask them,</v>

916
00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:12.513
<v Speaker 2>he use this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you can't do </v>

917
00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:17.240
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] [inaudible] I can change </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

918
00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:22.210
<v Speaker 2>Creative guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to get all sorts of like it's</v>

919
00:50:22.211 --> 00:50:23.200
<v Speaker 2>a hack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

920
00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:28.610
<v Speaker 2>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so conservatives are low in openness</v>

921
00:50:28.611 --> 00:50:29.444
<v Speaker 2>and high in conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness fractionated into </v>

922
00:50:32.331 --> 00:50:33.164
<v Speaker 2>industriousness in order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he does and they're particularly </v>

923
00:50:34.881 --> 00:50:37.940
<v Speaker 2>high in orderliness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the conservative,</v>

924
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.540
<v Speaker 2>not a very creative or and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>confection.</v>

925
00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:42.433
<v Speaker 2>Here's some other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say I'm ordering traditional </v>

926
00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:51.700
<v Speaker 2>hierarchical kid dutiful hi candidate </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

927
00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:53.150
<v Speaker 2>tactical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conventional,</v>

928
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:54.590
<v Speaker 2>narrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>predictable.</v>

929
00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:57.600
<v Speaker 2>Now some of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're labeled,</v>

930
00:50:57.650 --> 00:51:02.650
<v Speaker 2>you say none of that for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Traditional hierarchical,</v>

931
00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:05.810
<v Speaker 2>Jill doing it full or orderly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

932
00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:08.750
<v Speaker 2>well do you want things in order or not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>

933
00:51:08.751 --> 00:51:12.080
<v Speaker 2>the traffic lights working one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his throw one time so to speak.</v>

934
00:51:12.081 --> 00:51:14.210
<v Speaker 2>You are with things to do what they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to do.</v>

935
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:15.103
<v Speaker 2>So like while that the ordinary people </v>
<v Speaker 2>out or do you want to go do something </v>

936
00:51:17.751 --> 00:51:19.300
<v Speaker 2>exciting to get the hell away from them?</v>

937
00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:24.950
<v Speaker 2>They have to have point now you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>get to order and that's for sure and you</v>

938
00:51:24.951 --> 00:51:29.040
<v Speaker 2>can get to anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing is that there's kickass</v>

939
00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:33.950
<v Speaker 2>cookies at the end of the temperamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>distributions to neurotic dog.</v>

940
00:51:33.951 --> 00:51:35.870
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Too conscientious.</v>

941
00:51:36.010 --> 00:51:39.440
<v Speaker 2>You give a no on the obsessive side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe develop an eating disorder,</v>

942
00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:43.250
<v Speaker 2>too agreeable everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sacrificing myself for everybody.</v>

943
00:51:43.251 --> 00:51:44.084
<v Speaker 2>It's like team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're resentful and bitter because it </v>

944
00:51:45.201 --> 00:51:50.201
<v Speaker 2>can't stand up for yourself</v>
<v Speaker 2>to friend prison</v>

945
00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:59.370
<v Speaker 2>incarceration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like William Straight.</v>

946
00:51:59.410 --> 00:52:02.180
<v Speaker 2>If you're bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go off the rails because people make</v>

947
00:52:02.181 --> 00:52:03.250
<v Speaker 2>loud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to be happy.</v>

948
00:52:03.251 --> 00:52:03.721
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

949
00:52:03.721 --> 00:52:08.721
<v Speaker 2>how many do you want to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>impulsive and there's no trace of it.</v>

950
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:13.080
<v Speaker 2>Someone who's an addict is they only </v>
<v Speaker 2>money?</v>

951
00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:13.993
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the world is such a wonderful </v>

952
00:52:14.631 --> 00:52:15.670
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You find.</v>

953
00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:19.570
<v Speaker 2>I just find that happy people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>impulsive as a year.</v>

954
00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:20.423
<v Speaker 2>Notice if you're one of those people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to drink because it energizes you </v>

955
00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:25.123
<v Speaker 2>and you know who's probably 10% of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in your life that it's like a </v>

956
00:52:27.741 --> 00:52:30.320
<v Speaker 2>dream to be energized because most of </v>
<v Speaker 2>you just to relax,</v>

957
00:52:30.330 --> 00:52:31.690
<v Speaker 2>but some of you get energized.</v>

958
00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:35.180
<v Speaker 2>It's like to make good decisions when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in that habit is no,</v>

959
00:52:35.570 --> 00:52:38.320
<v Speaker 2>happiness means rapport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can grab Napkins,</v>

960
00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:40.030
<v Speaker 2>you content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes that's what good idea,</v>

961
00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:40.913
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes it's read it knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So don't be thinking then you know you </v>

962
00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:45.253
<v Speaker 2>can't get to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like he'd get ready to be to </v>

963
00:52:46.971 --> 00:52:50.030
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know they're,</v>

964
00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:50.953
<v Speaker 2>they assess it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any virtue that becomes a virus and </v>

965
00:52:53.811 --> 00:52:57.710
<v Speaker 2>that's where I began with the lows and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the damn conservatives have to talk.</v>

966
00:52:58.420 --> 00:52:59.091
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

967
00:52:59.091 --> 00:52:59.924
<v Speaker 2>So if you think you got a company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to figure out how many </v>

968
00:53:01.501 --> 00:53:05.440
<v Speaker 2>advantages versus how many entrepreneurs</v>
<v Speaker 2>who need and that's what that is.</v>

969
00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:08.980
<v Speaker 2>And some circumstances there isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 2>balance.</v>

970
00:53:09.110 --> 00:53:09.943
<v Speaker 2>You can't say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you need like 40% free people and </v>

971
00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:13.333
<v Speaker 2>60% conscientious me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason you can't say that it's </v>

972
00:53:16.641 --> 00:53:20.750
<v Speaker 2>because the environment is a giant snake</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it continues.</v>

973
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:21.583
<v Speaker 2>It's giant eternal surfer and you're on </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's back and you don't know which way </v>

974
00:53:24.351 --> 00:53:25.184
<v Speaker 2>it's going to move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you fall off and fall off the left </v>

975
00:53:28.081 --> 00:53:31.410
<v Speaker 2>side of you die off right side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you die and still run.</v>

976
00:53:31.411 --> 00:53:34.020
<v Speaker 2>You want to do is stay approximately in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the middle.</v>

977
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:37.780
<v Speaker 2>And so when you need is one side </v>
<v Speaker 2>pulling,</v>

978
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:40.980
<v Speaker 2>pulling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pulling.</v>

979
00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:43.530
<v Speaker 2>And what you hope is that by holding </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other,</v>

980
00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:44.393
<v Speaker 2>you say in the name of the damn snake </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you think about how can you </v>

981
00:53:47.021 --> 00:53:47.854
<v Speaker 2>decide a pole and the answer is low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then maybe you killed the other </v>

982
00:53:53.941 --> 00:53:57.440
<v Speaker 2>person or they kill you and they need </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

983
00:53:57.450 --> 00:53:59.580
<v Speaker 2>As it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe your dad,</v>

984
00:53:59.730 --> 00:54:02.210
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't seem like a very good </v>
<v Speaker 2>solution again,</v>

985
00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:04.440
<v Speaker 2>that that's actually the frog you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to solve.</v>

986
00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:06.360
<v Speaker 2>And so you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

987
00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:10.380
<v Speaker 2>you can become slaves to the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can impress the other side.</v>

988
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:15.470
<v Speaker 2>You can find with the other side or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you can talk,</v>

989
00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:17.680
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

990
00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:20.560
<v Speaker 2>that's the alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can talk and you're going to talk to</v>

991
00:54:20.561 --> 00:54:23.140
<v Speaker 2>those annoying people who aren't white </v>
<v Speaker 2>kidney.</v>

992
00:54:23.290 --> 00:54:27.340
<v Speaker 2>And one of the advantages to those who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even people who aren't like,</v>

993
00:54:27.341 --> 00:54:28.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pleadings,</v>

994
00:54:28.421 --> 00:54:29.254
<v Speaker 2>you don't know</v>

995
00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:34.040
<v Speaker 2>all those people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get along so well,</v>

996
00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:38.270
<v Speaker 2>you're already like with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't remember anything from them.</v>

997
00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:40.130
<v Speaker 2>They just know what the same thing as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

998
00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:41.060
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

999
00:54:41.110 --> 00:54:45.030
<v Speaker 2>Do you know everything you need to know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do you know?</v>

1000
00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:46.463
<v Speaker 2>Where do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give me whether or not you know </v>

1001
00:54:48.321 --> 00:54:53.321
<v Speaker 2>everything you need to know who suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you're suffering and you are.</v>

1002
00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:57.993
<v Speaker 2>Then I would suggest you probably have </v>
<v Speaker 2>something to learn because maybe if you </v>

1003
00:55:00.801 --> 00:55:02.570
<v Speaker 2>learned that you wouldn't have to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1004
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:04.880
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they're not going to say,</v>

1005
00:55:04.881 --> 00:55:05.714
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since you were a new mobile soccer so </v>

1006
00:55:07.191 --> 00:55:09.260
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should talk to someone who knows the</v>

1007
00:55:09.261 --> 00:55:10.094
<v Speaker 2>things you don't because then we'll try </v>
<v Speaker 2>some things you don't know and then you </v>

1008
00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:17.060
<v Speaker 2>won't suffer so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And an ask the purpose of free speech.</v>

1009
00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:20.750
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's retracted with it now.</v>

1010
00:55:21.350 --> 00:55:23.790
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't use her problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well obviously.</v>

1011
00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:27.170
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you just tragic and shorter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a problem.</v>

1012
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:31.700
<v Speaker 2>Poor people have problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rich people have problems.</v>

1013
00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:34.910
<v Speaker 2>What are the things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually quite sad about socialists</v>

1014
00:55:35.050 --> 00:55:35.883
<v Speaker 2>and perhaps about catalyst as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And both Roddick can overestimate the </v>

1015
00:55:39.441 --> 00:55:42.770
<v Speaker 2>degree to which money can solve </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental existential crawls.</v>

1016
00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:48.100
<v Speaker 2>It actually can't own install.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is quite clear on that too.</v>

1017
00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:51.373
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you make enough money so </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not suffering from absolute </v>

1018
00:55:54.130 --> 00:55:58.570
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means that bill collectors chasing</v>

1019
00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:03.250
<v Speaker 2>you around the get your life miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then additional button on we call it.</v>

1020
00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:07.670
<v Speaker 2>And so when you get that baby at anybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>out to work in class,</v>

1021
00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:09.250
<v Speaker 2>they go higher than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1022
00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:11.990
<v Speaker 2>We might still be resentful because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are legal or Richard and you.</v>

1023
00:56:12.090 --> 00:56:13.880
<v Speaker 2>But did you get more money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't help.</v>

1024
00:56:14.110 --> 00:56:18.950
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well why would you still die?</v>

1025
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:20.503
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you ain't no longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they can help you in catch later </v>

1026
00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:24.850
<v Speaker 2>for an extra year.</v>

1027
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:28.743
<v Speaker 2>Divorce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it doesn't help me get along with </v>

1028
00:56:29.861 --> 00:56:30.694
<v Speaker 2>your wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't help you necessarily get </v>

1029
00:56:31.901 --> 00:56:33.370
<v Speaker 2>along with your kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1030
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:34.263
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't prevent him from dying or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>of various diseases doesn't make it my </v>

1031
00:56:38.770 --> 00:56:42.260
<v Speaker 2>similar while sometimes lots of times it</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't.</v>

1032
00:56:43.330 --> 00:56:47.050
<v Speaker 2>Once you solve your basic economic </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems cause she do,</v>

1033
00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:50.320
<v Speaker 2>just to repeat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does he have running water,</v>

1034
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:56.910
<v Speaker 2>shelter</v>
<v Speaker 2>and access to the information you're up.</v>

1035
00:56:57.370 --> 00:57:01.990
<v Speaker 2>Stitches you can be to except to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>comparitor your basic problems.</v>

1036
00:57:01.991 --> 00:57:03.650
<v Speaker 2>Our soul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1037
00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:07.870
<v Speaker 2>the 90th percentile and maybe you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to hit the nine ninth to like one or two</v>

1038
00:57:07.871 --> 00:57:08.704
<v Speaker 2>of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most of the problems I used to be </v>

1039
00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:11.793
<v Speaker 2>saul.</v>

1040
00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:15.193
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1041
00:57:15.330 --> 00:57:18.920
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people find problematic,</v>

1042
00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:20.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Life is suffering.</v>

1043
00:57:21.140 --> 00:57:26.140
<v Speaker 2>That's a fundamental rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rule is exactly her job.</v>

1044
00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:28.720
<v Speaker 2>She transcendence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a very straight,</v>

1045
00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:33.860
<v Speaker 2>very surreal to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you think</v>

1046
00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:43.600
<v Speaker 2>here's how animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the equipment,</v>

1047
00:57:44.850 --> 00:57:47.930
<v Speaker 2>you're not stupid hunting as </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably intelligent.</v>

1048
00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:51.080
<v Speaker 2>It's not the same kind of intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have.</v>

1049
00:57:51.290 --> 00:57:55.160
<v Speaker 2>So the mosquitoes I'm riding the giant </v>
<v Speaker 2>circuit to,</v>

1050
00:57:55.161 --> 00:57:55.994
<v Speaker 2>it's flipping everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of the ceos are talking about the </v>

1051
00:57:57.491 --> 00:58:00.480
<v Speaker 2>dog and so how do we manage that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there,</v>

1052
00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:04.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean is made and cruise a whole slew </v>
<v Speaker 2>of mosquitoes.</v>

1053
00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:11.080
<v Speaker 2>No patch if it was feels or at all died </v>
<v Speaker 2>except for one I didn't know [inaudible]</v>

1054
00:58:13.070 --> 00:58:17.720
<v Speaker 2>you just keep going and so many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many mosquito eggs,</v>

1055
00:58:17.830 --> 00:58:20.270
<v Speaker 2>art of mosquitoes way of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1056
00:58:20.410 --> 00:58:23.470
<v Speaker 2>Because what the mosquito was doing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>producing small parents.</v>

1057
00:58:23.471 --> 00:58:28.110
<v Speaker 2>I was south,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which of those are going to survive?</v>

1058
00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:32.130
<v Speaker 2>They're slightly different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you know,</v>

1059
00:58:32.131 --> 00:58:35.180
<v Speaker 2>her wonderfulness white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

1060
00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:38.030
<v Speaker 2>why don't scale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you go back and tell you why we need</v>

1061
00:58:38.031 --> 00:58:38.864
<v Speaker 2>the deep and I need a yard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So mosquitoes produce as much as areas </v>

1062
00:58:46.431 --> 00:58:48.690
<v Speaker 2>of themselves and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of them died.</v>

1063
00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:49.553
<v Speaker 2>And then one mosquito lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how they propagate themselves </v>

1064
00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:54.580
<v Speaker 2>through time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1065
00:58:57.100 --> 00:59:01.300
<v Speaker 2>human beings the opposite thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

1066
00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:04.313
<v Speaker 2>very deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very number limit wrap up his or our </v>

1067
00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:07.843
<v Speaker 2>salt water into educated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we do that because our children are </v>

1068
00:59:13.061 --> 00:59:16.880
<v Speaker 2>capable of producing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bearing sometimes sat in front of me.</v>

1069
00:59:18.610 --> 00:59:20.030
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you play,</v>

1070
00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:21.550
<v Speaker 2>did you get [inaudible] happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Bar,</v>

1071
00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:25.040
<v Speaker 2>you can send me out to her off that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in part because you know,</v>

1072
00:59:25.090 --> 00:59:27.530
<v Speaker 2>give him a paid promotion but you're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1073
00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:28.473
<v Speaker 2>So that's what an idea is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An idea is I'm avatar you and moral and </v>

1074
00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:34.473
<v Speaker 2>even think about this from an </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary perspective because the </v>

1075
00:59:36.471 --> 00:59:37.304
<v Speaker 2>prefrontal Cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the whole of your capacity to </v>

1076
00:59:39.621 --> 00:59:42.140
<v Speaker 2>think abstractly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grows the lower court.</v>

1077
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.983
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An order for Texas to thinking that </v>

1078
00:59:44.181 --> 00:59:46.860
<v Speaker 2>enables you to voluntarily [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1079
00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:49.450
<v Speaker 2>And so what you do when you fake is </v>
<v Speaker 2>generate,</v>

1080
00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:54.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm strapped versions of yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>test them in a fictional environment,</v>

1081
00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:55.633
<v Speaker 2>figure out which ones are stupid and </v>
<v Speaker 2>likely to die and then don't act those </v>

1082
01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:05.510
<v Speaker 2>out</v>
<v Speaker 2>then at that than others.</v>

1083
01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:07.123
<v Speaker 2>But nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the technical person doesn't act out </v>

1084
01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:12.303
<v Speaker 2>their stupidest ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we internalize the Darwinian </v>

1085
01:00:15.591 --> 01:00:16.424
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We think we pretty spare minutes of </v>

1086
01:00:18.471 --> 01:00:20.840
<v Speaker 2>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We killed them all for ourselves.</v>

1087
01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:21.973
<v Speaker 2>And then when you're coming out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones that you take your most likely </v>

1088
01:00:23.331 --> 01:00:26.730
<v Speaker 2>to survive pretty damn smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1089
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:31.100
<v Speaker 2>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he has limitations.</v>

1090
01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:33.920
<v Speaker 2>Limitations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1091
01:00:33.921 --> 01:00:37.070
<v Speaker 2>we talked about one</v>
<v Speaker 2>camera.</v>

1092
01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:39.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a local person,</v>

1093
01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:42.020
<v Speaker 2>phoned openness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the things that drives me</v>

1094
01:00:42.021 --> 01:00:46.700
<v Speaker 2>crazy about conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So concerns are blind to bub.</v>

1095
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.920
<v Speaker 2>They're so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I remember Harper,</v>

1096
01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.230
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be one of the dumbest </v>
<v Speaker 2>things he said.</v>

1097
01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:53.270
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about harvest.</v>

1098
01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:59.120
<v Speaker 2>He makes sense each hold like limousine </v>
<v Speaker 2>artists that were</v>

1099
01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:03.260
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sponging off the public purse.</v>

1100
01:01:03.261 --> 01:01:04.094
<v Speaker 2>You know these French artists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like there's like three rich </v>

1101
01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.760
<v Speaker 2>artists to Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1102
01:01:08.310 --> 01:01:09.143
<v Speaker 2>The probability that you're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard as an artist is so low that I </v>

1103
01:01:13.311 --> 01:01:14.144
<v Speaker 2>didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

1104
01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:15.231
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm you.</v>

1105
01:01:15.231 --> 01:01:17.770
<v Speaker 2>You're like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like an accident.</v>

1106
01:01:17.771 --> 01:01:18.604
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're an artist and he would make </v>

1107
01:01:20.281 --> 01:01:23.150
<v Speaker 2>enough money to survive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's impossible.</v>

1108
01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:26.390
<v Speaker 2>There's no rich artists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1109
01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:28.300
<v Speaker 2>but the conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't think,</v>

1110
01:01:28.301 --> 01:01:31.220
<v Speaker 2>they don't see that because they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>see the contribution that artists make.</v>

1111
01:01:31.221 --> 01:01:34.420
<v Speaker 2>You're blind to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I can give you exactly what,</v>

1112
01:01:34.421 --> 01:01:39.421
<v Speaker 2>how open people work and how they </v>
<v Speaker 2>contribute to the public good.</v>

1113
01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:41.660
<v Speaker 2>If he had a large city like Wilson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1114
01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:46.340
<v Speaker 2>you don't look at these trashy areas </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are kind of cool and the old people</v>

1115
01:01:46.341 --> 01:01:50.630
<v Speaker 2>go there and the reason they go there is</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's the frontier.</v>

1116
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:53.030
<v Speaker 2>And that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people go to the frontier,</v>

1117
01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.730
<v Speaker 2>the Korean type status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their niche is the frontier.</v>

1118
01:01:55.790 --> 01:01:58.190
<v Speaker 2>There's for all tiers everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's four in science.</v>

1119
01:01:58.191 --> 01:02:00.890
<v Speaker 2>Does Frontier [inaudible] frontier as </v>
<v Speaker 2>literature.</v>

1120
01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:01.813
<v Speaker 2>There's frontiers in cities and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>frontier in the cities where there's </v>

1121
01:02:04.701 --> 01:02:09.000
<v Speaker 2>other Lemar chaos then order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's potential artistic type.</v>

1122
01:02:09.001 --> 01:02:10.200
<v Speaker 2>Sniff that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I as part of,</v>

1123
01:02:10.210 --> 01:02:11.043
<v Speaker 2>if they can only afford rent there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't just go hang out with your </v>

1124
01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:17.210
<v Speaker 2>neighbor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>

1125
01:02:17.211 --> 01:02:18.620
<v Speaker 2>hey hon and rough name because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

1126
01:02:18.621 --> 01:02:21.070
<v Speaker 2>hey this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can sniff out</v>

1127
01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:23.693
<v Speaker 2>galleries and maybe we start to go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee shops and then they start to do </v>

1128
01:02:25.711 --> 01:02:29.580
<v Speaker 2>cool things and it starts to get cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the legs helping people who are</v>

1129
01:02:29.581 --> 01:02:32.430
<v Speaker 2>still kind of open go here and hay out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think that's cool.</v>

1130
01:02:32.490 --> 01:02:33.323
<v Speaker 2>And then the entrepreneurial capital was</v>
<v Speaker 2>tied to start to notice and they start </v>

1131
01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:41.910
<v Speaker 2>the road safe and they have a place </v>
<v Speaker 2>judge requires the artistic chased,</v>

1132
01:02:41.911 --> 01:02:42.340
<v Speaker 2>the Reiki.</v>

1133
01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:43.930
<v Speaker 2>They don't have anybody cause they know </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to</v>

1134
01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:50.100
<v Speaker 2>improve some of the carbon for the city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what creative people do.</v>

1135
01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:52.970
<v Speaker 2>Beauty has an incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible value.</v>

1136
01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:54.620
<v Speaker 2>Think about Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You came,</v>

1137
01:02:54.621 --> 01:02:58.000
<v Speaker 2>it's a blend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two as a people or cities,</v>

1138
01:02:58.010 --> 01:03:01.830
<v Speaker 2>there's the garden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're European cities.</v>

1139
01:03:01.831 --> 01:03:02.664
<v Speaker 2>Men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like were you saying about the hundreds </v>

1140
01:03:06.481 --> 01:03:08.570
<v Speaker 2>of millions or billions of dollars that </v>
<v Speaker 2>those dams,</v>

1141
01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:12.750
<v Speaker 2>European step in Fargo cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think about the return on investment</v>

1142
01:03:12.751 --> 01:03:13.840
<v Speaker 2>that they gathered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1143
01:03:13.930 --> 01:03:14.763
<v Speaker 2>I mean places like France and Spain have</v>
<v Speaker 2>more tourists then people all the time </v>

1144
01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:20.690
<v Speaker 2>because people are going there from all </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the world,</v>

1145
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:23.460
<v Speaker 2>bathing beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

1146
01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:29.160
<v Speaker 2>it's useful to talk to them open types </v>
<v Speaker 2>and do appreciate what they have Prof.</v>

1147
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:30.503
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're blinded by your camper </v>

1148
01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:35.660
<v Speaker 2>conservatives camps and beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1149
01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:37.253
<v Speaker 2>liberal types,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if they're low in order to </v>

1150
01:03:38.671 --> 01:03:40.680
<v Speaker 2>get us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't see the value of diligence or</v>

1151
01:03:40.681 --> 01:03:41.460
<v Speaker 2>duty.</v>

1152
01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:44.700
<v Speaker 2>So I ran it the right fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional,</v>

1153
01:03:44.701 --> 01:03:45.870
<v Speaker 2>hierarchical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other gym,</v>

1154
01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:46.850
<v Speaker 2>beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>orderly,</v>

1155
01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:48.450
<v Speaker 2>hygienic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>puritanical,</v>

1156
01:03:48.451 --> 01:03:50.640
<v Speaker 2>conventional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>narrow and predictable.</v>

1157
01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:51.653
<v Speaker 2>The hygienic and puritanical thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could get up and down that's </v>

1158
01:03:54.151 --> 01:03:56.100
<v Speaker 2>associated with disgust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity.</v>

1159
01:03:56.490 --> 01:03:57.323
<v Speaker 2>There aren't really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are very sensitive to the US and </v>

1160
01:03:59.221 --> 01:04:00.054
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason that the hyper </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative types are exclusionary is </v>

1161
01:04:04.081 --> 01:04:08.130
<v Speaker 2>because they build walls around </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves to prevent contamination.</v>

1162
01:04:08.490 --> 01:04:10.680
<v Speaker 2>And we'll get back to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's reasons for that.</v>

1163
01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:12.950
<v Speaker 2>It's not arbitrary prejudice all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1164
01:04:12.951 --> 01:04:16.590
<v Speaker 2>It can be arbitrary prejudice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately it's more complicated that</v>

1165
01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:19.770
<v Speaker 2>left fingers radical fluid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mercurial,</v>

1166
01:04:19.771 --> 01:04:23.130
<v Speaker 2>Carolyn's chaotic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unsanitary and promiscuous,</v>

1167
01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:28.500
<v Speaker 2>12th of and he's doing it depends on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your perspective.</v>

1168
01:04:29.570 --> 01:04:33.090
<v Speaker 2>It's a little harder on the old sexually</v>
<v Speaker 2>transmitted disease.</v>

1169
01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:39.180
<v Speaker 2>You know</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people did age killed?</v>

1170
01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:44.010
<v Speaker 2>About 400 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a fairly high increase in</v>

1171
01:04:44.011 --> 01:04:44.844
<v Speaker 2>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say so it's not like there's </v>

1172
01:04:47.641 --> 01:04:48.474
<v Speaker 2>nothing serious at the bottom of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>various is there's something damn </v>

1173
01:04:50.791 --> 01:04:51.624
<v Speaker 2>serious at the bottom of them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's real room for flora of have </v>

1174
01:04:55.401 --> 01:04:58.110
<v Speaker 2>informed opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1175
01:04:58.111 --> 01:05:00.780
<v Speaker 2>so you got the conservative tax low in </v>
<v Speaker 2>openness,</v>

1176
01:05:00.781 --> 01:05:01.614
<v Speaker 2>high in conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want something done to their people </v>

1177
01:05:03.421 --> 01:05:04.650
<v Speaker 2>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're liable.</v>

1178
01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:07.800
<v Speaker 2>They're traditional or hierarchical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have Velma structures,</v>

1179
01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:09.500
<v Speaker 2>their guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>native soldiers.</v>

1180
01:05:09.850 --> 01:05:12.180
<v Speaker 2>It's very brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupt military accomplishment.</v>

1181
01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.520
<v Speaker 2>Conscientiousness is a good grip crew of</v>
<v Speaker 2>race.</v>

1182
01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:17.090
<v Speaker 2>It's a good predictor of manager of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bakery.</v>

1183
01:05:20.790 --> 01:05:24.550
<v Speaker 2>The next test doesn't predict creative </v>
<v Speaker 2>production,</v>

1184
01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:27.820
<v Speaker 2>openness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Openness is actually slightly need.</v>

1185
01:05:27.821 --> 01:05:29.380
<v Speaker 2>If he call me and we started ticketing </v>
<v Speaker 2>product,</v>

1186
01:05:29.381 --> 01:05:31.060
<v Speaker 2>did it as far as we can tell because </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

1187
01:05:31.110 --> 01:05:31.943
<v Speaker 2>support,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly diligent rather than their </v>

1188
01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:35.890
<v Speaker 2>artistic the sciences and dealt with </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the process.</v>

1189
01:05:35.891 --> 01:05:36.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1190
01:05:36.490 --> 01:05:37.323
<v Speaker 2>it's a fact that you can grind it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which just part of why it's so damn </v>

1191
01:05:39.311 --> 01:05:43.500
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're gonna say,</v>

1192
01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:48.600
<v Speaker 2>well why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would openness and conscientiousness</v>

1193
01:05:48.731 --> 01:05:52.180
<v Speaker 2>go together?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You political belief because they're not</v>

1194
01:05:52.181 --> 01:05:53.740
<v Speaker 2>coordinating those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's traits.</v>

1195
01:05:53.970 --> 01:05:54.803
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem to be any real reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>why they should clump together to </v>

1196
01:05:57.281 --> 01:06:01.360
<v Speaker 2>determine the clinical to be turn in </v>
<v Speaker 2>political opinion viewpoint.</v>

1197
01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:03.880
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about this a lot and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

1198
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:05.340
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1199
01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:10.090
<v Speaker 2>the older people they like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like the Jack in the box,</v>

1200
01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:13.440
<v Speaker 2>jump out the blocks and if they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want the box to stay closed,</v>

1201
01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:15.610
<v Speaker 2>they want all the possibility and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>box does spring out.</v>

1202
01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:19.240
<v Speaker 2>And so they can do cool things with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're go to conscientiousness,</v>

1203
01:06:19.241 --> 01:06:20.620
<v Speaker 2>they're going disgust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity.</v>

1204
01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:22.660
<v Speaker 2>So we are a character of borders between</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1205
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.823
<v Speaker 2>So on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not afraid of the absence of </v>

1206
01:06:25.721 --> 01:06:26.554
<v Speaker 2>borders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm have to be like the exciting </v>

1207
01:06:27.881 --> 01:06:28.714
<v Speaker 2>things that happens to the barbers are </v>
<v Speaker 2>transgressed against and I were </v>

1208
01:06:31.181 --> 01:06:31.721
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1209
01:06:31.721 --> 01:06:34.540
<v Speaker 2>that pump conservative types,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're high in conscientiousness.</v>

1210
01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:36.360
<v Speaker 2>It's like they like orders that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>ordered.</v>

1211
01:06:36.361 --> 01:06:40.900
<v Speaker 2>They like to be protected from </v>
<v Speaker 2>contamination and the overall in this,</v>

1212
01:06:40.901 --> 01:06:42.820
<v Speaker 2>so they don't get any thrown with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jack in the box,</v>

1213
01:06:42.821 --> 01:06:45.010
<v Speaker 2>jumps up the box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just think that they should stay in</v>

1214
01:06:45.011 --> 01:06:47.920
<v Speaker 2>the box for long it long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I thought,</v>

1215
01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:48.873
<v Speaker 2>well that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know I mentioned that works every </v>

1216
01:06:50.201 --> 01:06:53.560
<v Speaker 2>single level of analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the conservative types,</v>

1217
01:06:53.561 --> 01:06:57.100
<v Speaker 2>like the border around concepts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three main title identities,</v>

1218
01:06:57.130 --> 01:07:00.000
<v Speaker 2>sexual identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's holes,</v>

1219
01:07:00.070 --> 01:07:03.070
<v Speaker 2>private property towels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>provinces,</v>

1220
01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:04.090
<v Speaker 2>states.</v>

1221
01:07:04.450 --> 01:07:05.283
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's what happened in the last </v>

1222
01:07:06.071 --> 01:07:07.780
<v Speaker 2>election.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what happened.</v>

1223
01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:11.530
<v Speaker 2>The trial because what did he say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's feel the wall.</v>

1224
01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:12.693
<v Speaker 2>It's about the borders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what's happening to Europe </v>

1225
01:07:14.411 --> 01:07:16.330
<v Speaker 2>to it's the borders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1226
01:07:16.331 --> 01:07:17.560
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>

1227
01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:21.250
<v Speaker 2>That's what politics is about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about borders between things.</v>

1228
01:07:21.610 --> 01:07:23.890
<v Speaker 2>And if the fundamental argument is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1229
01:07:23.891 --> 01:07:25.570
<v Speaker 2>she's worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She opened her clothes.</v>

1230
01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:26.553
<v Speaker 2>And the answer that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends on the circumstances because </v>

1231
01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:33.030
<v Speaker 2>we're driving and johnny sermon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Number,</v>

1232
01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:36.160
<v Speaker 2>which weeks where you turn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes here's what happens.</v>

1233
01:07:36.161 --> 01:07:38.350
<v Speaker 2>If you open the borders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grace,</v>

1234
01:07:38.770 --> 01:07:39.603
<v Speaker 2>let's say you woke up from accidentally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is what happened to the native </v>

1235
01:07:41.771 --> 01:07:44.440
<v Speaker 2>Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are warriors,</v>

1236
01:07:44.770 --> 01:07:46.390
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and his family.</v>

1237
01:07:46.391 --> 01:07:47.530
<v Speaker 2>And she'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1238
01:07:47.531 --> 01:07:50.020
<v Speaker 2>you know the Spaniards and showed out </v>
<v Speaker 2>for off on.</v>

1239
01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:50.873
<v Speaker 2>We have the social side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly rough time for the native </v>

1240
01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:56.380
<v Speaker 2>Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1241
01:07:56.380 --> 01:07:58.150
<v Speaker 2>we conquered the entire territory.</v>

1242
01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:58.983
<v Speaker 2>But no man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had horses and armor and the need </v>

1243
01:08:01.261 --> 01:08:03.250
<v Speaker 2>for having a crisis at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1244
01:08:03.251 --> 01:08:04.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was bad luck,</v>

1245
01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:05.433
<v Speaker 2>but that wasn't the real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real problem is that the Spanish </v>

1246
01:08:08.921 --> 01:08:09.754
<v Speaker 2>were filled with the absolutely filthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all the European city dwellers of </v>

1247
01:08:13.271 --> 01:08:15.030
<v Speaker 2>the time packed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And can you,</v>

1248
01:08:15.270 --> 01:08:17.580
<v Speaker 2>he's living with animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roy.</v>

1249
01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:21.320
<v Speaker 2>The disease developed immunity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>diseases.</v>

1250
01:08:21.321 --> 01:08:22.980
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we got small parts,</v>

1251
01:08:23.010 --> 01:08:23.843
<v Speaker 2>but to die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they book very horrible for chicken pox </v>

1252
01:08:27.981 --> 01:08:31.850
<v Speaker 2>and we lived through the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can make her mom's like healthy.</v>

1253
01:08:31.851 --> 01:08:32.684
<v Speaker 2>You were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you were well armed against </v>

1254
01:08:34.461 --> 01:08:36.020
<v Speaker 2>pathogens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1255
01:08:36.130 --> 01:08:38.420
<v Speaker 2>not the North Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the Americans.</v>

1256
01:08:38.421 --> 01:08:40.550
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's hardly any disease here.</v>

1257
01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:41.743
<v Speaker 2>So the Spanish showed up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even 5% of the native American </v>

1258
01:08:45.801 --> 01:08:48.290
<v Speaker 2>style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1259
01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:49.993
<v Speaker 2>Think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many of them died and the puritans </v>

1260
01:08:52.641 --> 01:08:54.860
<v Speaker 2>showed up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a long time out with Hispanic,</v>

1261
01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:55.733
<v Speaker 2>showed up.</v>

1262
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.160
<v Speaker 2>The native Americans were happy to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to the Internet,</v>

1263
01:08:58.190 --> 01:08:59.690
<v Speaker 2>going to be able to take off their </v>
<v Speaker 2>crops,</v>

1264
01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:03.640
<v Speaker 2>guessing like the third of European sky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1265
01:09:03.650 --> 01:09:08.420
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was a border issue to break</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the racks came in off the shifts</v>

1266
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:12.270
<v Speaker 2>and it sailed somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>30% of the European startups,</v>

1267
01:09:12.290 --> 01:09:13.130
<v Speaker 2>black player.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1268
01:09:13.131 --> 01:09:13.964
<v Speaker 2>that's not good compared to 95% all in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the borders to see what the hell </v>

1269
01:09:18.501 --> 01:09:21.140
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's dangerous.</v>

1270
01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:22.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal types.</v>

1271
01:09:22.521 --> 01:09:23.354
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1272
01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:24.940
<v Speaker 2>not all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wonderful.</v>

1273
01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:27.570
<v Speaker 2>Now the liberals will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1274
01:09:27.571 --> 01:09:29.090
<v Speaker 2>I'll just hold on a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1275
01:09:29.091 --> 01:09:29.924
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1276
01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:33.950
<v Speaker 2>there's some danger in close quarter in </v>
<v Speaker 2>open borders,</v>

1277
01:09:33.951 --> 01:09:35.870
<v Speaker 2>but they won't say that because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't see that.</v>

1278
01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:37.750
<v Speaker 2>But if they were sensitive and we'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1279
01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:41.750
<v Speaker 2>we buy the argument that there's danger </v>
<v Speaker 2>in open borders.</v>

1280
01:09:42.150 --> 01:09:47.150
<v Speaker 2>I think of all the drivers just soak the</v>
<v Speaker 2>borders between everyday was like,</v>

1281
01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:49.970
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fluency and thought.</v>

1282
01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:50.803
<v Speaker 2>You here to talk about the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the fluency in thought and the </v>

1283
01:09:53.541 --> 01:09:57.050
<v Speaker 2>ability to think divergently and </v>
<v Speaker 2>creativity.</v>

1284
01:09:57.051 --> 01:09:58.100
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1285
01:09:58.110 --> 01:10:01.250
<v Speaker 2>become old and borders between things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between concepts,</v>

1286
01:10:01.251 --> 01:10:03.140
<v Speaker 2>between people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between towns.</v>

1287
01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:04.933
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to have any new ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to get anything new </v>

1288
01:10:06.941 --> 01:10:07.774
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're hungry to go find a stranger from </v>

1289
01:10:09.831 --> 01:10:10.664
<v Speaker 2>another culture and welcome them in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>find out what they held her up to a </v>

1290
01:10:12.871 --> 01:10:15.080
<v Speaker 2>train and come and get all the cool </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

1291
01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:18.920
<v Speaker 2>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we caused the borders to type it,</v>

1292
01:10:18.921 --> 01:10:19.754
<v Speaker 2>then what's going to happen is we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to stay that safety regarding to </v>

1293
01:10:23.211 --> 01:10:24.560
<v Speaker 2>stand to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro,</v>

1294
01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:27.350
<v Speaker 2>look the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talk the same and then the damn snake</v>

1295
01:10:27.351 --> 01:10:30.260
<v Speaker 2>is going to move and every single one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>us is going to fall off.</v>

1296
01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.120
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1297
01:10:32.930 --> 01:10:37.760
<v Speaker 2>well sort of service and gavel open the </v>
<v Speaker 2>borders staff and the liberals say</v>

1298
01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:42.920
<v Speaker 2>closed borders debt and the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of them are right.</v>

1299
01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:43.813
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're both right and that's why we </v>

1300
01:10:47.481 --> 01:10:49.580
<v Speaker 2>need to talk to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>

1301
01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:51.133
<v Speaker 2>because we can't out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So figure out how to stay on the </v>

1302
01:10:54.861 --> 01:10:57.740
<v Speaker 2>secretary of the snake without talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>to them.</v>

1303
01:10:58.250 --> 01:10:59.083
<v Speaker 2>Now you've got your biases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your cognitive biases that are built </v>

1304
01:11:01.311 --> 01:11:02.144
<v Speaker 2>into you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you're blind to all solve the </v>

1305
01:11:04.191 --> 01:11:06.390
<v Speaker 2>world and so you're going to sit down </v>
<v Speaker 2>and fit.</v>

1306
01:11:07.010 --> 01:11:10.600
<v Speaker 2>If you're thinking you actually break </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself into avatars,</v>

1307
01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:12.470
<v Speaker 2>cards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you give all those appetizers,</v>

1308
01:11:12.471 --> 01:11:13.304
<v Speaker 2>the voice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you let them how she knows and </v>

1309
01:11:15.301 --> 01:11:16.650
<v Speaker 2>the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where did she go?</v>

1310
01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:20.670
<v Speaker 2>So even when you were thinking you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically engaged in dialogue,</v>

1311
01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:22.390
<v Speaker 2>it's just what you're doing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>internally.</v>

1312
01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:23.573
<v Speaker 2>But you have limits on that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're very good at figuring </v>

1313
01:11:25.681 --> 01:11:26.514
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably don't want it because </v>

1314
01:11:26.791 --> 01:11:28.420
<v Speaker 2>people aren't going to do the thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1315
01:11:28.421 --> 01:11:29.254
<v Speaker 2>They're really good at jumping into </v>
<v Speaker 2>predetermined to conclusions and very </v>

1316
01:11:31.741 --> 01:11:34.290
<v Speaker 2>bad thing because it's hard to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's annoying.</v>

1317
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:36.900
<v Speaker 2>It's just stressful that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>technically difficult.</v>

1318
01:11:36.990 --> 01:11:39.720
<v Speaker 2>It requires training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be able to write,</v>

1319
01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:42.600
<v Speaker 2>you have to be able to think clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel to formulate an argument you have</v>

1320
01:11:42.601 --> 01:11:43.434
<v Speaker 2>to read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's really hard to think and </v>

1321
01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:50.540
<v Speaker 2>sold as much as could just fly over your</v>
<v Speaker 2>built a priori temperamental soldiers,</v>

1322
01:11:51.090 --> 01:11:53.490
<v Speaker 2>which is what people do to to a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree.</v>

1323
01:11:53.550 --> 01:11:55.590
<v Speaker 2>But when I say you can figure to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree,</v>

1324
01:11:55.650 --> 01:11:58.230
<v Speaker 2>well good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that means there's forms of death and</v>

1325
01:11:58.231 --> 01:12:00.600
<v Speaker 2>misery then you can avoid with some </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree of,</v>

1326
01:12:00.990 --> 01:12:03.870
<v Speaker 2>of you tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're full of biases.</v>

1327
01:12:03.871 --> 01:12:04.704
<v Speaker 2>You're going to miss this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is part of why married people live </v>

1328
01:12:07.081 --> 01:12:09.420
<v Speaker 2>longer and you never narrative someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're annoying.</v>

1329
01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:10.313
<v Speaker 2>You could think differently than you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's so helpful if you listen to </v>

1330
01:12:12.601 --> 01:12:13.434
<v Speaker 2>them because they can have two brains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two brains actually get you through the </v>

1331
01:12:16.291 --> 01:12:17.124
<v Speaker 2>royal families of one grade if the </v>
<v Speaker 2>brains are communicating and if they </v>

1332
01:12:19.951 --> 01:12:21.120
<v Speaker 2>have some differences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1333
01:12:21.121 --> 01:12:22.590
<v Speaker 2>because then you're not just producing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same.</v>

1334
01:12:23.490 --> 01:12:28.490
<v Speaker 2>So if I open myself up to someone else </v>
<v Speaker 2>and talk to them it in dialogue,</v>

1335
01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:31.193
<v Speaker 2>then be correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The errors in my thinking and then </v>

1336
01:12:33.721 --> 01:12:34.554
<v Speaker 2>perhaps less less chance of suffering </v>
<v Speaker 2>and dying and so the reason that you </v>

1337
01:12:40.741 --> 01:12:41.574
<v Speaker 2>have to engage your Donald Donald's </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that lifts you out of your a </v>

1338
01:12:43.921 --> 01:12:44.754
<v Speaker 2>parochial view and helps you clarify the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world and clarify how to act in the </v>

1339
01:12:50.791 --> 01:12:53.810
<v Speaker 2>world with all these different people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have to get along with.</v>

1340
01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:54.743
<v Speaker 2>That's part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also to survive just in the world </v>

1341
01:12:57.570 --> 01:13:00.930
<v Speaker 2>and make a little sidebar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here is something that we can talk about</v>

1342
01:13:00.931 --> 01:13:01.764
<v Speaker 2>more in future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have been thinking about those damn </v>

1343
01:13:04.291 --> 01:13:08.880
<v Speaker 2>postmodernists</v>
<v Speaker 2>pernicious,</v>

1344
01:13:09.150 --> 01:13:09.983
<v Speaker 2>horrible idea is true that any text has </v>
<v Speaker 2>an infinite number of potential </v>

1345
01:13:15.570 --> 01:13:16.403
<v Speaker 2>interpretations and then therefore </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way of determining which </v>

1346
01:13:19.891 --> 01:13:23.850
<v Speaker 2>interpretation is correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the problem with that interpretation</v>

1347
01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:24.773
<v Speaker 2>because it in some perverse sense is </v>
<v Speaker 2>true because there are so many </v>

1348
01:13:29.221 --> 01:13:34.221
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon the delay themselves before </v>
<v Speaker 2>you even the world that you can construe</v>

1349
01:13:34.281 --> 01:13:37.890
<v Speaker 2>it involved in different ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's for the wrong.</v>

1350
01:13:43.630 --> 01:13:45.510
<v Speaker 2>They say you can interpret it that same </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1351
01:13:45.550 --> 01:13:48.690
<v Speaker 2>Therefore you're traveling the world in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a way because the world is like a text.</v>

1352
01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:52.450
<v Speaker 2>If it has multiple potential donation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but looking for</v>

1353
01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:56.250
<v Speaker 2>some of those interpretations will kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1354
01:13:56.970 --> 01:13:59.520
<v Speaker 2>Someone goes into her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>patients will make you suffer.</v>

1355
01:13:59.850 --> 01:14:02.660
<v Speaker 2>Some of those are patients will make </v>
<v Speaker 2>people around you suffer.</v>

1356
01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:05.850
<v Speaker 2>Some of those interpretations will make </v>
<v Speaker 2>people hate you.</v>

1357
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:10.350
<v Speaker 2>Some of those interpretations will make </v>
<v Speaker 2>people refuse to cooperate with you.</v>

1358
01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:11.633
<v Speaker 2>So you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there's this multiplicity of </v>

1359
01:14:13.031 --> 01:14:17.500
<v Speaker 2>interpretations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's constrained by the necessity of</v>

1360
01:14:17.501 --> 01:14:19.840
<v Speaker 2>preserving yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Preservative,</v>

1361
01:14:19.841 --> 01:14:22.200
<v Speaker 2>dyadic relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>preservative,</v>

1362
01:14:22.210 --> 01:14:23.260
<v Speaker 2>progams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social,</v>

1363
01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:26.080
<v Speaker 2>social contexts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So happy in a manner.</v>

1364
01:14:26.081 --> 01:14:30.850
<v Speaker 2>So pursuing your own selfish interests </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely stabilized old damn game.</v>

1365
01:14:30.910 --> 01:14:33.790
<v Speaker 2>And also when you act in the actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

1366
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:37.240
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't slap you so hard across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>face that you perish.</v>

1367
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:38.583
<v Speaker 2>And so yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are home with the DMP </v>

1368
01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:41.253
<v Speaker 2>certifications,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is a very tiny fraction of </v>

1369
01:14:44.071 --> 01:14:46.870
<v Speaker 2>them that actually have any functional </v>
<v Speaker 2>utility.</v>

1370
01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:48.113
<v Speaker 2>So I'm the runs completely be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nihilistic argument related to </v>

1371
01:14:53.711 --> 01:14:56.310
<v Speaker 2>multiplicity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's at the basis of postmodernist.</v>

1372
01:14:56.770 --> 01:14:57.603
<v Speaker 2>They know what's at the basis of </v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodernism cause that's why they </v>

1373
01:14:59.411 --> 01:15:00.244
<v Speaker 2>turned the Marxism Dornier themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you can't do anything if you're </v>

1374
01:15:02.981 --> 01:15:05.980
<v Speaker 2>a postmodernist because there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>proper solution.</v>

1375
01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:09.460
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to free speech.</v>

1376
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:14.103
<v Speaker 2>You have to think because if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>think you die but you're too stupid to </v>

1377
01:15:17.531 --> 01:15:18.930
<v Speaker 2>pick rod,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>

1378
01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:21.760
<v Speaker 2>you have to talk to other people because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tell me why you're stupid.</v>

1379
01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:24.100
<v Speaker 2>And then if you listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not quite so stupid.</v>

1380
01:15:24.250 --> 01:15:27.550
<v Speaker 2>Now you go and die for often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the bottom line.</v>

1381
01:15:27.730 --> 01:15:28.563
<v Speaker 2>And they might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well who should I talk to them and </v>

1382
01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:30.373
<v Speaker 2>answered as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you talk to people that you agree </v>

1383
01:15:31.421 --> 01:15:32.254
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't burn anything cause they are </v>

1384
01:15:32.811 --> 01:15:33.644
<v Speaker 2>to think the same way you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And unless you're 100% correct and I </v>

1385
01:15:36.941 --> 01:15:39.790
<v Speaker 2>will be very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very hesitant about including that.</v>

1386
01:15:39.850 --> 01:15:43.240
<v Speaker 2>If you're still suffering and I her 100%</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct,</v>

1387
01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:44.610
<v Speaker 2>then you've got to go find out an </v>
<v Speaker 2>entity.</v>

1388
01:15:44.611 --> 01:15:45.444
<v Speaker 2>Have you talked to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because maybe they'll point something </v>

1389
01:15:46.931 --> 01:15:49.000
<v Speaker 2>out to you that you seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously,</v>

1390
01:15:49.001 --> 01:15:52.030
<v Speaker 2>seriously needs to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>

1391
01:15:52.050 --> 01:15:55.120
<v Speaker 2>our culture of Western civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say roughly speaking,</v>

1392
01:15:55.330 --> 01:15:56.200
<v Speaker 2>it's a good culture.</v>

1393
01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:58.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm the utopian,</v>

1394
01:15:58.600 --> 01:15:59.433
<v Speaker 2>it's got its problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you compare it to a hypothetical </v>

1395
01:16:01.991 --> 01:16:06.430
<v Speaker 2>utopia is hell on earth except we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

1396
01:16:06.431 --> 01:16:09.970
<v Speaker 2>Hypothetical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Utopia actually tries to manifest itself</v>

1397
01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:12.490
<v Speaker 2>because Ben didn't find out what really </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

1398
01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:14.073
<v Speaker 2>But that is how you compare a society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you do is you take a society and </v>

1399
01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:18.433
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how are we good compared to like </v>

1400
01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:23.170
<v Speaker 2>other societies and actress?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1401
01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:25.930
<v Speaker 2>you won't be hampered skill you guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1402
01:16:25.931 --> 01:16:28.690
<v Speaker 2>They could go wherever they want and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they go,</v>

1403
01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:29.853
<v Speaker 2>well they go to that tiny handful of </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries that has the lacy that's </v>

1404
01:16:35.951 --> 01:16:38.650
<v Speaker 2>tightly associated with free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1405
01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:42.490
<v Speaker 2>Because basically we can solve our </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems that we have.</v>

1406
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:44.260
<v Speaker 2>We don't have any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got a loss,</v>

1407
01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:47.770
<v Speaker 2>but we can solve a why cause we figured </v>
<v Speaker 2>something out.</v>

1408
01:16:47.790 --> 01:16:48.623
<v Speaker 2>We figured out that there's nothing more</v>
<v Speaker 2>important than free speech because </v>

1409
01:16:53.111 --> 01:16:54.190
<v Speaker 2>that's what thinking is.</v>

1410
01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:57.610
<v Speaker 2>That's the logos that sits at the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 2>of our culture,</v>

1411
01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:58.473
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The divine word that transforms chaos </v>

1412
01:17:01.361 --> 01:17:05.620
<v Speaker 2>into order continually and you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking half,</v>

1413
01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:09.730
<v Speaker 2>not individually precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although you do as an can,</v>

1414
01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:10.573
<v Speaker 2>participate in conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>communication with other soul and also </v>

1415
01:17:17.810 --> 01:17:21.320
<v Speaker 2>sad you straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're not afraid,</v>

1416
01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:24.960
<v Speaker 2>then you suffer and die and so when </v>
<v Speaker 2>people around,</v>

1417
01:17:26.110 --> 01:17:29.920
<v Speaker 2>because lots of people laying that down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're nodding at that end,</v>

1418
01:17:29.930 --> 01:17:31.920
<v Speaker 2>if you're ready to get it done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should really</v>

1419
01:17:37.090 --> 01:17:42.090
<v Speaker 2>be hearing is it the task stuffy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the work to bring it to a hall,</v>

1420
01:17:42.410 --> 01:17:45.500
<v Speaker 2>making her song case for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a terrible case.</v>

1421
01:17:45.501 --> 01:17:50.501
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a profoundly flawed chase </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's predicated on the idea that</v>

1422
01:17:50.511 --> 01:17:53.640
<v Speaker 2>you've already done everything you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>to improve phase.</v>

1423
01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:55.633
<v Speaker 2>So I would say well before you transform</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself into the ultimate judge of </v>

1424
01:18:00.621 --> 01:18:01.454
<v Speaker 2>being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should try to get your act together </v>

1425
01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:05.810
<v Speaker 2>to some degree and see if you can draw </v>
<v Speaker 2>things around.</v>

1426
01:18:05.811 --> 01:18:10.580
<v Speaker 2>You can render your final judgment and </v>
<v Speaker 2>how you do that.</v>

1427
01:18:10.670 --> 01:18:13.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>

1428
01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:16.830
<v Speaker 2>What do you no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1429
01:18:16.831 --> 01:18:17.664
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where things aren't right that </v>

1430
01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:20.973
<v Speaker 2>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other and go on as well for you and </v>

1431
01:18:23.490 --> 01:18:25.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to work for your family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be,</v>

1432
01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:28.050
<v Speaker 2>or your community or your country or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world</v>

1433
01:18:32.150 --> 01:18:34.940
<v Speaker 2>you can be trying to solve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he asked us a couple,</v>

1434
01:18:34.941 --> 01:18:37.650
<v Speaker 2>are you touring assault?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the right person,</v>

1435
01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:40.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>First two years are trying to solve them</v>

1436
01:18:40.851 --> 01:18:45.851
<v Speaker 2>with all your heart and mind and soul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is no,</v>

1437
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:49.580
<v Speaker 2>I spent six hours a day wasting time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty much standard.</v>

1438
01:18:49.670 --> 01:18:54.080
<v Speaker 2>And you got no right to say anything at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all except started getting bacteria.</v>

1439
01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:58.520
<v Speaker 2>And so it's time for everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1440
01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:04.090
<v Speaker 2>That's the right response is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>orients you property towards Ba and then</v>

1441
01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:04.933
<v Speaker 2>being humble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing that you don't have your act </v>

1442
01:19:06.321 --> 01:19:07.154
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then maybe you open your eyes when you </v>

1443
01:19:08.511 --> 01:19:09.530
<v Speaker 2>say todd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just more things.</v>

1444
01:19:09.531 --> 01:19:11.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm stupid.</v>

1445
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:12.950
<v Speaker 2>And there's some people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>different from me.</v>

1446
01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:13.873
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if I talk to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to mostly cause you wouldn't </v>

1447
01:19:16.431 --> 01:19:19.070
<v Speaker 2>believe when people will bloody will </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you if you listen to them.</v>

1448
01:19:19.071 --> 01:19:24.071
<v Speaker 2>It's just absolutely unbelievable</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience listening to people.</v>

1449
01:19:25.461 --> 01:19:28.820
<v Speaker 2>Cause I'm a clinical psychologist cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like there's a dos nfc.</v>

1450
01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:29.693
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1451
01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:32.953
<v Speaker 2>Once you get the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>88 theological presuppositions and they </v>

1452
01:19:35.541 --> 01:19:39.200
<v Speaker 2>start talking about the reality that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're actually in contact with.</v>

1453
01:19:39.410 --> 01:19:43.790
<v Speaker 2>They're endlessly revealing and remark </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you learn.</v>

1454
01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:44.633
<v Speaker 2>And you mentioned listening to what a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good deal that is because you're not </v>

1455
01:19:47.811 --> 01:19:50.030
<v Speaker 2>very smart and he was suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>

1456
01:19:50.031 --> 01:19:51.620
<v Speaker 2>if you could learn something from </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>

1457
01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:54.820
<v Speaker 2>especially someone different than you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like wow,</v>

1458
01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:58.660
<v Speaker 2>it's a good day math in sixth grade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1459
01:19:58.910 --> 01:20:00.070
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1460
01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:00.953
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

1461
01:20:03.050 --> 01:20:06.170
<v Speaker 2>back to the left lane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1462
01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:09.020
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you are,</v>

1463
01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:15.823
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disintegrated or I don't pick up after </v>

1464
01:20:19.141 --> 01:20:23.890
<v Speaker 2>themselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>because sometimes we need that.</v>

1465
01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:28.350
<v Speaker 2>And then so there were no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a sec conservatives.</v>

1466
01:20:28.650 --> 01:20:33.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know they've got the blinders on,</v>

1467
01:20:33.031 --> 01:20:36.910
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just not that exciting this page</v>

1468
01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:44.340
<v Speaker 2>and make it a little discriminatory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like things to stay where they are,</v>

1469
01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:46.100
<v Speaker 2>so they're not that much fun to party </v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

1470
01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:51.350
<v Speaker 2>You want something done?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1471
01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:56.090
<v Speaker 2>they're equal and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're hauling the people that you want</v>

1472
01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:58.560
<v Speaker 2>to be false sterilized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hypodermic needles,</v>

1473
01:20:58.561 --> 01:20:59.394
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

1474
01:21:03.330 --> 01:21:08.180
<v Speaker 2>So let's appreciate political </v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution and let's understand that.</v>

1475
01:21:08.190 --> 01:21:11.310
<v Speaker 2>You need to say on the dark in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm snake.</v>

1476
01:21:11.790 --> 01:21:12.623
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'll close with a little more </v>

1477
01:21:14.551 --> 01:21:18.720
<v Speaker 2>elaboration on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The main rationale for free speech,</v>

1478
01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:24.690
<v Speaker 2>that was something like free speech is </v>
<v Speaker 2>being used by fascists</v>

1479
01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:30.200
<v Speaker 2>or as far as politically correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Radical left is conservative.</v>

1480
01:21:30.550 --> 01:21:33.330
<v Speaker 2>Everything because he used to impress </v>
<v Speaker 2>the oppressed.</v>

1481
01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:35.273
<v Speaker 2>They got a one size fits all solution.</v>

1482
01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:43.440
<v Speaker 2>pathological world and that's part of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just too easy.</v>

01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:46.860
<v Speaker 2>I the side of the oppressed that needs </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a good person.</v>

01:21:57.441 --> 01:21:58.274
<v Speaker 2>the deal press.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes a hell of a lot of work to be </v>

1489
01:22:00.331 --> 01:22:01.164
<v Speaker 2>on the side of the oppressed and you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>do sergeants in the face of people that </v>

1490
01:22:04.351 --> 01:22:05.280
<v Speaker 2>you think you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's no matter to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why am against poverty?</v>

1493
01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:27.920
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

1494
01:22:34.850 --> 01:22:39.640
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

1495
01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:44.253
<v Speaker 2>you a word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there was some controversy company </v>

1496
01:22:50.851 --> 01:22:51.684
<v Speaker 2>come to visit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a little article in the </v>

1497
01:22:53.021 --> 01:22:58.021
<v Speaker 2>newspaper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody who was your professor said was</v>

1498
01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:01.880
<v Speaker 2>reprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was making the space on safe,</v>

1499
01:23:02.230 --> 01:23:07.230
<v Speaker 2>but you can tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions and get down to the,</v>

1500
01:23:13.570 --> 01:23:14.403
<v Speaker 2>and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tweeted out with top off the linfield </v>

1501
01:23:19.211 --> 01:23:24.211
<v Speaker 2>college to violate some safe space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a satirical show.</v>

1502
01:23:29.090 --> 01:23:32.460
<v Speaker 2>They got wind of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a pretty vicious tweet.</v>

1503
01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:42.350
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't matter the venue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean serious</v>

1504
01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:57.550
<v Speaker 2>of all the people who should be in favor</v>
<v Speaker 2>of free speech,</v>

1505
01:23:58.450 --> 01:24:02.330
<v Speaker 2>it shouldn't be the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically on the side of the people</v>

1506
01:24:02.331 --> 01:24:06.880
<v Speaker 2>press.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why the radical left precept position is</v>

1507
01:24:06.881 --> 01:24:09.850
<v Speaker 2>everything's a hyper dominant patriarchy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the people at the park,</v>

1508
01:24:09.870 --> 01:24:11.410
<v Speaker 2>all the power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1509
01:24:11.411 --> 01:24:14.380
<v Speaker 2>well then the people at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever they want,</v>

1510
01:24:14.381 --> 01:24:16.750
<v Speaker 2>they own the newspapers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they own TV stations.</v>

1511
01:24:16.810 --> 01:24:19.120
<v Speaker 2>They only advertisements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They only corporations.</v>

1512
01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:20.940
<v Speaker 2>They can say wherever they want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever</v>

1513
01:24:23.050 --> 01:24:25.800
<v Speaker 2>they don't need to be protected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously they have a little,</v>

1514
01:24:25.950 --> 01:24:28.840
<v Speaker 2>and I'm speaking from a logical </v>
<v Speaker 2>framework,</v>

1515
01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:29.733
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well who needs for connection if they </v>

1516
01:24:31.031 --> 01:24:35.170
<v Speaker 2>want to speak for obviously the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are up the water.</v>

1517
01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:38.200
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's review the evidence.</v>

1518
01:24:40.570 --> 01:24:44.890
<v Speaker 2>Social movements of the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the way mantra,</v>

1519
01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:48.700
<v Speaker 2>speak truth to power?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means you've got,</v>

1520
01:24:48.910 --> 01:24:49.743
<v Speaker 2>you have to be able to speak to speak </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and hypothetically not going to be </v>

1521
01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:56.830
<v Speaker 2>in power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things like,</v>

1522
01:24:56.831 --> 01:24:59.560
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot of what you've got on half</v>

1523
01:25:01.470 --> 01:25:05.170
<v Speaker 2>my core aid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why people are you kidding?</v>

1524
01:25:06.190 --> 01:25:08.890
<v Speaker 2>He's got a lot of courage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy and he's conquered.</v>

1525
01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:11.470
<v Speaker 2>Know he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a show both.</v>

1526
01:25:11.530 --> 01:25:13.450
<v Speaker 2>He started my butt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's version of vital</v>

1527
01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:18.373
<v Speaker 2>comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like definitely got Walter play because </v>

1528
01:25:19.781 --> 01:25:21.440
<v Speaker 2>they're good at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're good at social critics.</v>

1529
01:25:21.441 --> 01:25:24.040
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so far you got to speak truth to power.</v>

1530
01:25:24.041 --> 01:25:26.700
<v Speaker 2>Well then you better be able to speed </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1531
01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:29.140
<v Speaker 2>That's the fundamental issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1532
01:25:29.970 --> 01:25:31.740
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're left your,</v>

1533
01:25:32.050 --> 01:25:35.350
<v Speaker 2>you want to slap it on the inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Rhogam and you think,</v>

1534
01:25:35.351 --> 01:25:36.184
<v Speaker 2>well Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be able to talk about this </v>

1535
01:25:36.971 --> 01:25:37.720
<v Speaker 2>at least.</v>

1536
01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:41.260
<v Speaker 2>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let's,</v>

1537
01:25:41.530 --> 01:25:44.220
<v Speaker 2>let's restrict free speech and many </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1538
01:25:44.290 --> 01:25:46.300
<v Speaker 2>Here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a lesson from the military.</v>

1539
01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:48.560
<v Speaker 2>If you make a weapon here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meb,</v>

1540
01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:52.020
<v Speaker 2>how's it been 15 years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1541
01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:56.380
<v Speaker 2>the logical conclusion to that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like kind of be slightly carry</v>

1542
01:25:56.390 --> 01:26:00.850
<v Speaker 2>both which weapons you made it and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the lesson for their free speech?</v>

1543
01:26:01.190 --> 01:26:02.710
<v Speaker 2>Trump haters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like</v>

1544
01:26:05.090 --> 01:26:07.880
<v Speaker 2>you guys are the ones who think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone else has to power.</v>

1545
01:26:08.690 --> 01:26:09.523
<v Speaker 2>You start restricting free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you're doing what you're doing it </v>

1546
01:26:13.130 --> 01:26:14.660
<v Speaker 2>radically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>continually,</v>

1547
01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:17.870
<v Speaker 2>no stall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you think for a moment.</v>

1548
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:20.270
<v Speaker 2>If those people who have the power and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1549
01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.760
<v Speaker 2>let's say the crooked people who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the power,</v>

1550
01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:25.160
<v Speaker 2>just to clarify it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just take that,</v>

1551
01:26:25.161 --> 01:26:28.400
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to get a lot better at</v>
<v Speaker 2>that than me real quick here.</v>

1552
01:26:28.401 --> 01:26:30.310
<v Speaker 2>So glad they're naive and it's doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>even funny.</v>

1553
01:26:30.890 --> 01:26:35.810
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every single one he used to oppress free</v>

1554
01:26:35.811 --> 01:26:38.770
<v Speaker 2>speech is going to be a bat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would force it.</v>

1555
01:26:38.810 --> 01:26:41.600
<v Speaker 2>You can imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then you wonder,</v>

1556
01:26:41.630 --> 01:26:43.790
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are pushing us west whatsapp</v>

1557
01:26:43.810 --> 01:26:46.740
<v Speaker 2>with are naive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that whole?</v>

1558
01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:47.633
<v Speaker 2>Are they going to eat or are they </v>
<v Speaker 2>willfully blind or are they actually </v>

1559
01:26:50.671 --> 01:26:53.610
<v Speaker 2>malevolent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they actually aiming at,</v>

1560
01:26:54.990 --> 01:26:59.820
<v Speaker 2>now I'll go with naive because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the simplest explanation,</v>

1561
01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:02.820
<v Speaker 2>but I wouldn't rule out the other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1562
01:27:02.821 --> 01:27:07.620
<v Speaker 2>so let's look at the 20th century</v>
<v Speaker 2>suffered.</v>

1563
01:27:07.621 --> 01:27:08.880
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women's rights.</v>

1564
01:27:09.530 --> 01:27:12.690
<v Speaker 2>How did that come about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freedom of speech,</v>

1565
01:27:13.650 --> 01:27:14.483
<v Speaker 2>labor unions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the powerful did not want the labor </v>

1566
01:27:17.341 --> 01:27:19.350
<v Speaker 2>unions to organize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did that come upon?</v>

1567
01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:23.640
<v Speaker 2>Freedom of speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of civil rights for black people and</v>

1568
01:27:23.641 --> 01:27:24.680
<v Speaker 2>Mexicans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Mexicans,</v>

1569
01:27:24.681 --> 01:27:26.460
<v Speaker 2>civil rights movement isn't as well </v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

1570
01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:27.353
<v Speaker 2>How'd that come about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about constitutional protection for </v>

1571
01:27:30.691 --> 01:27:31.524
<v Speaker 2>free of fees?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the students who it started in </v>

1572
01:27:34.301 --> 01:27:37.120
<v Speaker 2>that absolute grassy s virtually</v>

1573
01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:42.300

<v Speaker 3>The free</v>

1574
01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:49.430

<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] 65 after.</v>

1575
01:27:49.730 --> 01:27:51.020
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1576
01:27:51.021 --> 01:27:51.854
<v Speaker 2>there was a ban on normal standard </v>
<v Speaker 2>campus political activities and so the </v>

1577
01:27:55.931 --> 01:28:00.050
<v Speaker 2>students fought for the right to free </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech and academic freedom and the one,</v>

1578
01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:05.210
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't since they're on the left,</v>

1579

<v Speaker 2>those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1580
01:28:06.141 --> 01:28:08.120
<v Speaker 2>they were already ally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's a civil rights movement,</v>

1581
01:28:08.330 --> 01:28:09.163
<v Speaker 2>they became the leaders of the students </v>
<v Speaker 2>move with him as he had them anti war </v>

1582
01:28:11.151 --> 01:28:14.570
<v Speaker 2>movement to other movements which </v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on free speech.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What about the environmental movement or</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lgbt movement with all,</v>

1584
01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:24.640

<v Speaker 2>obviously these were can you support rex</v>

1585
01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:26.713
<v Speaker 2>marginalized people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All they had was their capacity to </v>

1586
01:28:29.781 --> 01:28:34.030
<v Speaker 2>formulate an argument to make a sad </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacks if they didn't have the power.</v>

<v Speaker 2>if you will crest like you claim,</v>

1592
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:51.823
<v Speaker 2>then you should be standing up as </v>
<v Speaker 2>diligently as you possibly can for free </v>

1593
01:28:55.611 --> 01:28:56.444
<v Speaker 2>speech because it's the most powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>weapon you have to write the societal </v>

1594
01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:05.580
<v Speaker 2>that you're hypothetically and perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 2>realistically concerned about.</v>

1595
01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:09.030
<v Speaker 2>We have to discuss inequality for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>

1596
01:29:09.090 --> 01:29:09.923
<v Speaker 2>You have to discuss it long enough until</v>
<v Speaker 2>we figure out how saw everything from </v>

1597
01:29:14.941 --> 01:29:15.774
<v Speaker 2>stacking up at one end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution and then everyone else </v>

1598
01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:22.020
<v Speaker 2>hitting zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is going to be a big problem.</v>

1599
01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:23.470
<v Speaker 2>So example,</v>

1600
01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:26.693
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1601
01:29:27.010 --> 01:29:30.640
<v Speaker 2>the Tesla guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're building on top of the sarcoma,</v>

1602
01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:32.890
<v Speaker 2>but they're not stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1603
01:29:33.220 --> 01:29:37.310
<v Speaker 2>you ain't going to stop there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're building a condoms.</v>

1604
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:40.450
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're building robots and robots.</v>

1605
01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:44.560
<v Speaker 2>Autonomous Robots are first going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take the shape of a car.</v>

1606
01:29:44.830 --> 01:29:49.830
<v Speaker 2>An autonomous car is no more a car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the car was a horse drawn carriage.</v>

1607
01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:50.913
<v Speaker 2>They're not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not even close to the same </v>

1608
01:29:53.261 --> 01:29:54.094
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're going to produce societal </v>

1609
01:29:55.481 --> 01:29:57.930
<v Speaker 2>transformations that are so radical </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifter unmanageable.</v>

1610
01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:00.730
<v Speaker 2>But I can tell you one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformations that going to occur,</v>

1611
01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:05.680
<v Speaker 2>what's the most common source of </v>
<v Speaker 2>employment for Man in North America?</v>

1612
01:30:06.580 --> 01:30:09.390
<v Speaker 2>Driver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1613
01:30:09.550 --> 01:30:12.310
<v Speaker 2>And so for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the autonomous robots show up,</v>

1614
01:30:12.370 --> 01:30:16.180
<v Speaker 2>which isn't going to be very long then </v>
<v Speaker 2>why all those people going to do,</v>

1615
01:30:16.750 --> 01:30:19.720
<v Speaker 2>and the answer is they're going to stack</v>
<v Speaker 2>up at zero.</v>

1616
01:30:20.350 --> 01:30:22.300
<v Speaker 2>And that's what's already happened in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States.</v>

1617
01:30:22.301 --> 01:30:24.610
<v Speaker 2>In particular in the rust belts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1618
01:30:24.611 --> 01:30:26.170
<v Speaker 2>that's why trump got elected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1619
01:30:26.171 --> 01:30:31.000
<v Speaker 2>Because the Damn Democrats here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute stupidity abandoned the working</v>

1620
01:30:31.001 --> 01:30:35.380
<v Speaker 2>class who make important to represent </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1621
01:30:35.410 --> 01:30:38.530
<v Speaker 2>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be dispossessed people.</v>

1622
01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:43.000
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be a big problem and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to figure out how to solve it.</v>

1623
01:30:43.090 --> 01:30:45.280
<v Speaker 2>And so we need an active laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need the left.</v>

1624
01:30:45.281 --> 01:30:50.281
<v Speaker 2>It actually stands for not postmodernism</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not daredevil,</v>

1625
01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:52.780
<v Speaker 2>murderous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reprehensible.</v>

1626
01:30:52.810 --> 01:30:55.570
<v Speaker 2>Marxism like that has to go</v>

1627
01:30:56.590 --> 01:31:01.590
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

1628
01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:11.760
<v Speaker 2>Rodney Times attracting Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem to be terrific,</v>

1629
01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:23.360
<v Speaker 2>but in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an accusation,</v>

1630
01:31:23.361 --> 01:31:24.194
<v Speaker 2>that's b level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's something strange at </v>

1631
01:31:28.970 --> 01:31:29.781
<v Speaker 2>mcmaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1632
01:31:29.781 --> 01:31:32.780
<v Speaker 2>there's that big demonstration against </v>
<v Speaker 2>me and uh,</v>

1633
01:31:33.460 --> 01:31:35.600
<v Speaker 2>there's of students there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they were students,</v>

1634
01:31:35.601 --> 01:31:37.430
<v Speaker 2>they were professional protest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your gripes.</v>

1635
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:38.743
<v Speaker 2>And if they were students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they haven't been educated by the </v>

1636
01:31:41.351 --> 01:31:46.351
<v Speaker 2>professors</v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor into what's essentially a call.</v>

1637
01:31:47.050 --> 01:31:51.650
<v Speaker 2>And they showed up with a big banner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had a hammer and sickle on.</v>

1638
01:31:52.970 --> 01:31:54.080
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell?</v>

1639
01:31:54.980 --> 01:31:55.870
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm serious.</v>

1640
01:31:55.871 --> 01:31:58.700
<v Speaker 2>Like this is not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not funny.</v>

1641
01:32:00.370 --> 01:32:02.830
<v Speaker 2>The circle was mostly used to cut off </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's heads.</v>

1642
01:32:04.110 --> 01:32:06.750
<v Speaker 2>What are in the 20th century was no </v>
<v Speaker 2>cocktail and chill.</v>

1643
01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:10.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You still got North Korea to deal with.</v>

1644
01:32:10.510 --> 01:32:12.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't real communism.</v>

1645
01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:14.630
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your city is,</v>

1646
01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:15.553
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see plenty of examples of real </v>

1647
01:32:16.361 --> 01:32:17.194
<v Speaker 2>communism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I would say you'd have to tell them </v>

1648
01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:20.113
<v Speaker 2>university circumstance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll problem because people will know </v>

1649
01:32:22.571 --> 01:32:26.950
<v Speaker 2>more dare to go and do a protest without</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood hammer and sickle,</v>

1650
01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:29.740
<v Speaker 2>the name of the gear to go in a Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 2>uniform.</v>

1651
01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:31.853
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean by social scientists in</v>
<v Speaker 2>universities identified themselves as </v>

1652
01:32:36.401 --> 01:32:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Marxists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1653
01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:42.880
<v Speaker 2>why the hell is that acceptable?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it take for us to learn?</v>

1654
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:46.780
<v Speaker 2>Or obviously a couple of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your desk and the Cold War,</v>

1655
01:32:47.530 --> 01:32:49.570
<v Speaker 2>nuclear thermal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear annihilation,</v>

1656
01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:52.540
<v Speaker 2>while one is</v>

1657
01:32:55.390 --> 01:32:56.223
<v Speaker 2>anyways,</v>

1658
01:33:00.530 --> 01:33:01.363
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mnemonics calling investigations that </v>

1659
01:33:02.241 --> 01:33:03.074
<v Speaker 2>I've done trying to get to the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 2>have indicated to me that there's </v>

1660
01:33:08.690 --> 01:33:12.080
<v Speaker 2>something to the notion of being eternal</v>
<v Speaker 2>human soul.</v>

1661
01:33:12.410 --> 01:33:15.590
<v Speaker 2>Now you'd called a metaphor if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

1662
01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:16.371
<v Speaker 2>Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for us,</v>

1663
01:33:16.371 --> 01:33:18.700
<v Speaker 2>turn out to be extraordinarily powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

1664
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:22.970
<v Speaker 2>How is this sold?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conceptualized?</v>

1665
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:27.880
<v Speaker 2>Conceptualized is either prophetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>voice,</v>

1666
01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:33.140
<v Speaker 2>so [inaudible] Jewish conceptualization </v>
<v Speaker 2>or as the logos and what is that?</v>

1667
01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:35.263
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the voice that restructures in </v>

1668
01:33:38.060 --> 01:33:38.893
<v Speaker 2>equitable social societies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the prophetic voice that makes </v>

1669
01:33:42.161 --> 01:33:45.740
<v Speaker 2>the horse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that transforms the chaos of potential,</v>

1670
01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:46.633
<v Speaker 2>which is everywhere around us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into Howard Bloom order in which that </v>

1671
01:33:51.380 --> 01:33:55.270
<v Speaker 2>soul manifests itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the society,</v>

1672
01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:57.890
<v Speaker 2>we can be guided by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This term,</v>

1673
01:33:58.610 --> 01:33:59.443
<v Speaker 2>all through communication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>term free speech limitation on that is </v>

1674
01:34:05.241 --> 01:34:06.074
<v Speaker 2>to put a limitation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say on the Holy Spirit itself </v>

1675
01:34:10.610 --> 01:34:13.870
<v Speaker 2>and not the sin that cannot be forgiven.</v>

1676
01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:15.360
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1677
01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:20.360
<v Speaker 2>And so why would say wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop allowing people to do this.</v>

1678
01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:28.950
<v Speaker 2>Then you don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's brandon left,</v>

1679
01:34:29.260 --> 01:34:31.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever</v>

1680
01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:33.583
<v Speaker 2>you can possibly do is dependent on your</v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to communicate what you believe </v>

1681
01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:44.480
<v Speaker 2>as clearly as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's your holy duty to do that.</v>

1682
01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:50.320
<v Speaker 2>And anyone who interferes with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>interferes with the proper on the phone.</v>

1683
01:34:51.401 --> 01:34:56.401
<v Speaker 2>We going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's up and it's a catastrophe.</v>

1684
01:34:57.660 --> 01:34:58.493
<v Speaker 2>Have</v>

1685
01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:04.120
<v Speaker 4>universities in shed and the humanities </v>
<v Speaker 4>specifically are the worst offenders.</v>

1686
01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:13.840
<v Speaker 4>Thank [inaudible] uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't actually have a question.</v>

1687
01:36:11.271 --> 01:36:12.104
<v Speaker 4>I was just wondering if you could </v>
<v Speaker 4>comment on kind of the before and after </v>

1688
01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:17.960
<v Speaker 4>of your life from the point where video </v>
<v Speaker 4>games,</v>

1689
01:36:17.961 --> 01:36:21.330
<v Speaker 4>political correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just want to tell a little anecdote,</v>

1690
01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:25.970
<v Speaker 4>a little story about</v>
<v Speaker 4>the vortex.</v>

1691
01:36:25.971 --> 01:36:30.971
<v Speaker 4>You got sucked into</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first part.</v>

1692
01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:39.130
<v Speaker 4>Mostly it's surreal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was</v>

1693
01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:48.180
<v Speaker 4>surreal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1694
01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:53.120
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these videos as upset,</v>

1695
01:36:53.330 --> 01:36:56.020
<v Speaker 4>I need to</v>
<v Speaker 4>design</v>

1696
01:36:57.820 --> 01:37:02.820
<v Speaker 4>apps to church people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Apple Watch things at the same time</v>

1697
01:37:09.110 --> 01:37:09.943
<v Speaker 4>I started to toy with youtube because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a little bit of exposure on public </v>

1698
01:37:14.201 --> 01:37:19.201
<v Speaker 4>health issue for Ontario and they get a </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the course.</v>

1699
01:37:19.730 --> 01:37:20.563
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so I put those on youtube and you </v>

1700
01:37:23.151 --> 01:37:24.740
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people watch them a little bit.</v>

1701
01:37:24.741 --> 01:37:26.970
<v Speaker 4>And then I started from my lectures on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the two of them.</v>

1702
01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:28.213
<v Speaker 4>I thought that was cool school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crappy videos and that sort of thing </v>

1703
01:37:33.741 --> 01:37:34.574
<v Speaker 4>through,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was,</v>

1704
01:37:35.340 --> 01:37:38.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a Frankenstein Monster,</v>

1705
01:37:38.271 --> 01:37:39.104
<v Speaker 4>like</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] [inaudible] set up my </v>

1706
01:37:43.261 --> 01:37:44.094
<v Speaker 4>patriarch accounting because I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>curious about how cruel people can </v>

1707
01:37:46.251 --> 01:37:47.084
<v Speaker 4>monetize their products.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Patriarchal seems like the </v>

1708
01:37:48.611 --> 01:37:51.310
<v Speaker 4>electricity thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I thought I'd explore it.</v>

1709
01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:55.370
<v Speaker 4>Best thing to do with that is to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>involved in all</v>

1710
01:37:58.690 --> 01:38:03.480
<v Speaker 4>views over three years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I had about 10,000 subscribers.</v>

1711
01:38:03.481 --> 01:38:05.250
<v Speaker 4>We were talking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know us a lot.</v>

1712
01:38:05.730 --> 01:38:07.240
<v Speaker 4>That's a long view with a man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I sold,</v>

1713
01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:09.900
<v Speaker 4>we sold a million copies and B,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1714
01:38:09.901 --> 01:38:14.901
<v Speaker 4>I can do touchdown dances in that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would catch that with dances,</v>

1715
01:38:15.090 --> 01:38:16.290
<v Speaker 4>ecstasy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You never see.</v>

1716
01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:24.260
<v Speaker 4>And so</v>
<v Speaker 4>in September,</v>

1717
01:38:24.270 --> 01:38:28.470
<v Speaker 4>October I be picking on political </v>
<v Speaker 4>correctness for quite a while back,</v>

1718
01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:31.680
<v Speaker 4>I was writing a book which is going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be published in February.</v>

1719
01:38:31.681 --> 01:38:36.480
<v Speaker 4>It's called 12 the 12 things everyone </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't hope for life.</v>

1720
01:38:36.750 --> 01:38:39.230
<v Speaker 4>An antidote to chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1721
01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:40.343
<v Speaker 4>Coming down from the facility,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of those jobs it's called chapters </v>

1722
01:38:43.321 --> 01:38:44.154
<v Speaker 4>in that book is called [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 4>The children that they're skateboarding </v>

1723
01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:51.380
<v Speaker 4>and it's all political correctness and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's always obsessing me.</v>

1724
01:38:51.461 --> 01:38:52.800
<v Speaker 4>Cause if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>since you get into that,</v>

1725
01:38:52.801 --> 01:38:55.910
<v Speaker 4>it's just takes over your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1726
01:38:56.580 --> 01:38:58.810
<v Speaker 4>I got news,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how would this bill see?</v>

1727
01:38:58.850 --> 01:38:59.683
<v Speaker 4>16 then I investigated it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I also had a couple of clinical clients </v>

1728
01:39:03.571 --> 01:39:04.404
<v Speaker 4>would be drinking beyond your limit of </v>
<v Speaker 4>tolerance by politically correct people </v>

1729
01:39:07.351 --> 01:39:09.470
<v Speaker 4>in your workplace.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who are really harassing the hell out of</v>

1730
01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:13.980
<v Speaker 4>the name of sensible people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so all of that working together when</v>

1731
01:39:13.981 --> 01:39:18.981
<v Speaker 4>I thought I was not sleeping one night </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I can either write it or I could get</v>

1732
01:39:19.330 --> 01:39:20.163
<v Speaker 4>video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how to make video and see if like my </v>

1733
01:39:21.791 --> 01:39:23.760
<v Speaker 4>cell phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it goes to this political practice,</v>

1734
01:39:23.770 --> 01:39:24.603
<v Speaker 4>your university and also just what's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to make it mandatory for their </v>

1735
01:39:28.201 --> 01:39:29.010
<v Speaker 4>human resources.</v>

1736
01:39:29.010 --> 01:39:33.450
<v Speaker 4>People to either go auntie unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 4>bias training,</v>

1737
01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:38.600
<v Speaker 4>which I think is reprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I've made one video tell me about</v>

1738
01:39:40.770 --> 01:39:41.603
<v Speaker 4>why I thought bill CC scheme is </v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous and that we maybe have one </v>

1739
01:39:43.981 --> 01:39:48.960
<v Speaker 4>vote antivirus trig and unconscious bias</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

1740
01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:50.073
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I was a little clearer and I </v>

1741
01:39:52.230 --> 01:39:55.570
<v Speaker 4>thinking and I thought that was that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1742
01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:56.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen to people who watched it.</v>

1743
01:39:57.900 --> 01:39:58.880
<v Speaker 4>That's your job to feature.</v>

1744
01:40:01.950 --> 01:40:06.950
<v Speaker 4>And then it's been a tornado since then </v>
<v Speaker 4>and some of it's great.</v>

1745
01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:11.550
<v Speaker 4>Like this is great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of it's not so great,</v>

1746
01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:16.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was very worrisome or being for about</v>

1747
01:40:16.321 --> 01:40:17.154
<v Speaker 4>two months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mostly I would say on behalf of my </v>

1748
01:40:18.451 --> 01:40:23.451
<v Speaker 4>family because</v>
<v Speaker 4>my job was in Germany,</v>

1749
01:40:24.490 --> 01:40:25.323
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Severes here I got my two warning </v>

1750
01:40:27.031 --> 01:40:29.220
<v Speaker 4>letters from the university which were </v>
<v Speaker 4>full of lies.</v>

1751
01:40:29.470 --> 01:40:30.303
<v Speaker 4>Most of the admissions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>admissions with truth and I know how </v>

1752
01:40:34.530 --> 01:40:37.170
<v Speaker 4>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>corporations and she's fired people.</v>

1753
01:40:37.171 --> 01:40:40.470
<v Speaker 4>They send three letters of warning and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then if they take action,</v>

1754
01:40:40.770 --> 01:40:41.603
<v Speaker 4>that's what they were doing going down </v>
<v Speaker 4>the hr tactic and then which they were </v>

1755
01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:46.313
<v Speaker 4>continually going down except that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>know about the support and so what </v>

1756
01:40:51.031 --> 01:40:52.610
<v Speaker 4>happened to begin with was the </v>
<v Speaker 4>journalists,</v>

1757
01:40:52.670 --> 01:40:53.503
<v Speaker 4>they didn't and a good guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but some of them actually read the </v>

1758
01:41:00.011 --> 01:41:03.180
<v Speaker 4>material while I was waiting on my baby </v>
<v Speaker 4>and thought,</v>

1759
01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:05.800
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's actually just telling people what's</v>

1760
01:41:05.801 --> 01:41:08.680
<v Speaker 4>actually in the legislation and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were journalists</v>

1761
01:41:10.870 --> 01:41:13.960
<v Speaker 4>who handed it to be more conservative </v>
<v Speaker 4>about free speech.</v>

1762
01:41:14.140 --> 01:41:14.973
<v Speaker 4>Then rose and so going to watch the </v>
<v Speaker 4>journey was started after you my </v>

1763
01:41:18.761 --> 01:41:19.594
<v Speaker 4>favorite and then the social justice </v>
<v Speaker 4>warriors play their role because they </v>

1764
01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:24.160
<v Speaker 4>came up with a free speech rally and </v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1765
01:41:24.230 --> 01:41:28.800
<v Speaker 4>a variety of cinematically</v>
<v Speaker 4>describing that's</v>

1766
01:41:31.030 --> 01:41:34.230
<v Speaker 4>not strategically viable phase.</v>

1767
01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:41.333
<v Speaker 4>This is quite educated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't say cynical and dark heart </v>

1768
01:41:46.441 --> 01:41:51.070
<v Speaker 4>rate every time that as social justice </v>
<v Speaker 4>warriors you cannot me,</v>

1769
01:41:51.550 --> 01:41:54.610
<v Speaker 4>all I have to do is stand back </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] himself.</v>

1770
01:41:55.710 --> 01:41:59.270
<v Speaker 4>I was somewhat confusing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although expressing no get faster</v>

1771
01:42:02.010 --> 01:42:04.090
<v Speaker 4>tobacco.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a good example of that.</v>

1772
01:42:04.190 --> 01:42:05.023
<v Speaker 4>Like I could just sit back and let</v>
<v Speaker 4>the performance of her because I knew </v>

1773
01:42:12.201 --> 01:42:13.034
<v Speaker 4>that a very large number of people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>watch it and it was a very large number </v>

1774
01:42:16.421 --> 01:42:17.860
<v Speaker 4>of people did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so like</v>

1775
01:42:19.870 --> 01:42:22.700
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

1776
01:42:27.490 --> 01:42:30.930
<v Speaker 4>most of the rest of it is just surreal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know I do words.</v>

1777
01:42:31.980 --> 01:42:32.813
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't really have any idea what's </v>

1778
01:42:34.541 --> 01:42:35.374
<v Speaker 4>happening.</v>

1779
01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:40.690
<v Speaker 4>It's very difficult for me to pick the </v>
<v Speaker 4>proper level of analysis.</v>

1780
01:42:40.870 --> 01:42:44.800
<v Speaker 4>I do real deep at the fundamental level </v>
<v Speaker 4>of analysis.</v>

1781
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:48.640
<v Speaker 4>There's the social movements at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>deepest levels feel about,</v>

1782
01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:49.653
<v Speaker 4>but I still talking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's happening in Alaska somewhere </v>

1783
01:42:53.291 --> 01:42:56.320
<v Speaker 4>between philosophical and theological.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1784
01:42:57.640 --> 01:42:58.473
<v Speaker 4>we're in a moment of crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The things can go either way and I'm </v>

1785
01:43:02.531 --> 01:43:03.364
<v Speaker 4>hoping that they go through traffic and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm hoping that what I'm doing is </v>

1786
01:43:09.010 --> 01:43:12.820
<v Speaker 4>facilitating that turned to be very </v>
<v Speaker 4>careful with what I say.</v>

1787
01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:17.440
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and</v>

1788
01:43:19.690 --> 01:43:24.280
<v Speaker 4>then the close is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I decided a long time ago that there,</v>

1789
01:43:24.460 --> 01:43:25.293
<v Speaker 4>I learned a long time ago that there are</v>
<v Speaker 4>two ways of forgiving yourself through </v>

1790
01:43:27.710 --> 01:43:32.710
<v Speaker 4>like why you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you decide that you want use your layers</v>

1791
01:43:34.271 --> 01:43:35.104
<v Speaker 4>to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a lot better than not doing </v>

1792
01:43:36.851 --> 01:43:40.090
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the critical year into like,</v>

1793
01:43:40.100 --> 01:43:43.420
<v Speaker 4>except that's not going to use your </v>
<v Speaker 4>language to get what you want.</v>

1794
01:43:45.550 --> 01:43:47.220
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's another,</v>

1795
01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:53.070
<v Speaker 4>you'd use your language to state what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you observe and decentralized as clearly</v>

1796
01:43:55.881 --> 01:44:00.290
<v Speaker 4>as you possibly can and let whatever is </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to have.</v>

1797
01:44:01.460 --> 01:44:02.293
<v Speaker 4>So that's what I tried to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is all what's happened and </v>

1798
01:44:07.250 --> 01:44:08.083
<v Speaker 4>fundamentally it's okay with me because </v>
<v Speaker 4>already decided that whatever the </v>

1799
01:44:11.271 --> 01:44:14.240
<v Speaker 4>outcome was of doing that was going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be okay.</v>

1800
01:44:15.610 --> 01:44:16.443
<v Speaker 4>It's an act of faith.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's Dick after faith action because </v>

1801
01:44:19.551 --> 01:44:22.460
<v Speaker 4>you've decided that the world run better</v>
<v Speaker 4>on truth or false.</v>

1802
01:44:22.810 --> 01:44:23.643
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to stand on truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a decision that you speak the </v>

1803
01:44:27.231 --> 01:44:30.680
<v Speaker 4>truth and you let the cards fall where </v>
<v Speaker 4>they fall.</v>

1804
01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:36.280
<v Speaker 4>And so I was watching where they fall </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm trying to stay intact and so far</v>

1805
01:44:42.140 --> 01:44:45.380
<v Speaker 4>it's working.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So thank God</v>

1806
01:44:47.130 --> 01:44:52.130
<v Speaker 4>Eric.</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

1807
01:44:56.710 --> 01:45:01.130
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe we could go,</v>

1808
01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:02.533
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's make it a little bit though </v>

1809
01:45:03.150 --> 01:45:05.000
<v Speaker 4>because people want to know what the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hell's going on.</v>

1810
01:45:05.001 --> 01:45:08.260
<v Speaker 4>So how about 20 hours but time is it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like,</v>

1811
01:45:09.050 --> 01:45:09.883
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how about 20 after is that I'm doing </v>

1812
01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:12.153
<v Speaker 4>okay cause I won't be intelligible after</v>
<v Speaker 4>with open dialogue between the only </v>

1813
01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:23.800
<v Speaker 4>thing that helps keep communication </v>
<v Speaker 4>between could do to get a few clients.</v>

1814
01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:29.100
<v Speaker 4>How do you connect the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>cleaning certain ways to find,</v>

1815
01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:31.873
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well first of all I wouldn't say that </v>

1816
01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:35.570
<v Speaker 4>necessarily come down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1817
01:45:35.780 --> 01:45:39.590
<v Speaker 4>So there's an analogous problem in </v>
<v Speaker 4>clinical psychology,</v>

1818
01:45:39.770 --> 01:45:40.603
<v Speaker 4>which is how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you do to help someone who </v>

1819
01:45:42.411 --> 01:45:45.500
<v Speaker 4>doesn't want to be helpful and answer?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1820
01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:49.100
<v Speaker 4>I could use a new guest of quote against</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1821
01:45:49.101 --> 01:45:52.460
<v Speaker 4>It's another harsh one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't cast pearls before swine.</v>

1822
01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:56.120
<v Speaker 4>I took me a long time just going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>escape.</v>

1823
01:45:57.530 --> 01:46:00.410
<v Speaker 4>And what it means is that you deem </v>
<v Speaker 4>valuable.</v>

1824
01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:04.340
<v Speaker 4>What's valuable by offering it to people</v>
<v Speaker 4>who will not appreciate.</v>

1825
01:46:05.870 --> 01:46:06.703
<v Speaker 4>If you can engage to Donald's a summer </v>
<v Speaker 4>and go find someone that you can engage </v>

1826
01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:13.550
<v Speaker 4>with and maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you might say,</v>

1827
01:46:13.551 --> 01:46:15.290
<v Speaker 4>well what about those people?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I would say,</v>

1828
01:46:15.291 --> 01:46:16.124
<v Speaker 4>what the best thing to do with them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first day of the series you live in </v>

1829
01:46:21.771 --> 01:46:22.604
<v Speaker 4>again and burry the desk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the second answer is the only way </v>

1830
01:46:27.021 --> 01:46:32.021
<v Speaker 4>that you get a person a self if I can </v>
<v Speaker 4>help is by example.</v>

1831
01:46:33.860 --> 01:46:37.430
<v Speaker 4>So you'll walk away from people you </v>
<v Speaker 4>cannot communicate with,</v>

1832
01:46:38.050 --> 01:46:38.883
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>communicate with people who you can </v>

1833
01:46:39.861 --> 01:46:44.090
<v Speaker 4>communicate with and you try to put your</v>
<v Speaker 4>life in the water and then,</v>

1834
01:46:45.710 --> 01:46:49.800
<v Speaker 4>and then you hope that some of the wake </v>
<v Speaker 4>up and some of the well,</v>

1835
01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:52.670
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1836
01:46:54.330 --> 01:46:58.070
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

1837
01:47:00.930 --> 01:47:03.300
<v Speaker 2>thank you very much for your speech </v>
<v Speaker 2>tonight is fantastic.</v>

1838
01:47:03.810 --> 01:47:06.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my question was dre simple.</v>

1839
01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:07.073
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to do with your crowd funding </v>

1840
01:47:10.020 --> 01:47:10.853
<v Speaker 2>academic research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we recently did on Coco for </v>

1841
01:47:13.980 --> 01:47:15.510
<v Speaker 2>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it said,</v>

1842
01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:21.560
<v Speaker 2>and you raised more than doubles so far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your original goal is now $162,000,</v>

1843
01:47:22.921 --> 01:47:24.840
<v Speaker 2>which is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1844
01:47:24.900 --> 01:47:27.630
<v Speaker 2>and I hope the organizers of this event,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll post the links,</v>

1845
01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:30.720
<v Speaker 2>we can get more money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if your question is,</v>

1846
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:35.870
<v Speaker 2>this is the first time I've ever seen a </v>
<v Speaker 2>university research funded by the public</v>

1847
01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:40.320
<v Speaker 2>at large as opposed to through one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Canadian research councils,</v>

1848
01:47:40.321 --> 01:47:41.154
<v Speaker 2>which usually are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a community and there's a </v>

1849
01:47:42.211 --> 01:47:43.044
<v Speaker 2>different process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me it seems like it's precedent </v>

1850
01:47:45.121 --> 01:47:46.820
<v Speaker 2>setting is not willing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1851
01:47:46.910 --> 01:47:49.010
<v Speaker 2>How would you think this will change the</v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern,</v>

1852
01:47:49.340 --> 01:47:51.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>research funding in Canada?</v>

1853
01:47:51.500 --> 01:47:52.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>

1854
01:47:52.701 --> 01:47:53.534
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I haven't talked </v>

1855
01:47:55.460 --> 01:47:56.530
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1856
01:47:56.531 --> 01:47:58.540
<v Speaker 2>if that's how I'm my campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1857
01:47:58.820 --> 01:48:02.990
<v Speaker 2>It's the real community is now they </v>
<v Speaker 2>asked me if they could run it and I said</v>

1858
01:48:02.991 --> 01:48:04.370
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

1859
01:48:04.700 --> 01:48:09.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe I would've done it on my</v>
<v Speaker 2>own because it seemed like,</v>

1860
01:48:15.610 --> 01:48:16.443
<v Speaker 2>what did it seem like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems in some sense by capitalizing </v>

1861
01:48:19.481 --> 01:48:22.370
<v Speaker 2>on misfortune know and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>

1862
01:48:22.371 --> 01:48:23.890
<v Speaker 2>so they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy about that.</v>

1863
01:48:24.040 --> 01:48:24.873
<v Speaker 2>But when they decided to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to a number of people that I </v>

1864
01:48:27.431 --> 01:48:30.850
<v Speaker 2>know about what this could conceivably </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1865
01:48:30.910 --> 01:48:31.743
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that we thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>about was setting up a system whereby </v>

1866
01:48:36.130 --> 01:48:37.960
<v Speaker 2>other professors could do the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1867
01:48:37.961 --> 01:48:40.140
<v Speaker 2>I've been researchers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no doors,</v>

1868
01:48:40.150 --> 01:48:40.983
<v Speaker 2>some sites like set up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's one called the spear </v>

1869
01:48:42.740 --> 01:48:43.573
<v Speaker 2>mint.com I passed right by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it does fine with these sorts of </v>

1870
01:48:47.171 --> 01:48:48.390
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1871
01:48:49.170 --> 01:48:50.003
<v Speaker 2>it might be worth investigating whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is say a reasonable and Broccoli </v>

1872
01:48:55.030 --> 01:48:55.863
<v Speaker 2>precedent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't obvious to me that I have </v>

1873
01:48:57.821 --> 01:49:00.580
<v Speaker 2>the time to investigate that old enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>to figure out how to do it.</v>

1874
01:49:00.910 --> 01:49:03.520
<v Speaker 2>And that's part of what I'm trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out right now.</v>

1875
01:49:03.610 --> 01:49:04.443
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to be talking to people </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the next couple of months in all </v>

1876
01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:08.770
<v Speaker 2>likelihood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have some,</v>

1877
01:49:09.010 --> 01:49:09.843
<v Speaker 2>some supporters who are reasonably well </v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalized and they are interested in </v>

1878
01:49:16.120 --> 01:49:18.220
<v Speaker 2>working to allow that sort of thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

1879
01:49:18.820 --> 01:49:20.710
<v Speaker 2>But it's very complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>

1880
01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:22.113
<v Speaker 2>I'm already walking by and so I know the</v>
<v Speaker 2>answer is I don't know what sort of </v>

1881
01:49:26.050 --> 01:49:28.960
<v Speaker 2>precedent and step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do know that it's going to keep,</v>

1882
01:49:28.990 --> 01:49:31.690
<v Speaker 2>my graduate students were waiting for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the next three years.</v>

1883
01:49:32.050 --> 01:49:35.900
<v Speaker 2>So with any luck I'll apply for another </v>
<v Speaker 2>grant this fall and yet,</v>

1884
01:49:35.950 --> 01:49:38.600
<v Speaker 2>and then I'll have more money than I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would that would be funding.</v>

1885
01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:39.513
<v Speaker 2>So I hope that,</v>

1886
01:49:48.020 --> 01:49:48.853
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to thank you for posting your </v>

1887
01:49:51.401 --> 01:49:54.290
<v Speaker 2>videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The lectures on the young and archetypes</v>

1888
01:49:54.310 --> 01:49:57.130
<v Speaker 2>president of the lion king is worthwhile</v>
<v Speaker 2>if anyone's interested.</v>

1889
01:49:57.910 --> 01:50:01.510
<v Speaker 2>My question though is about the limits </v>
<v Speaker 2>and restrictions on free speech.</v>

1890
01:50:01.780 --> 01:50:05.500
<v Speaker 2>So honestly we're opposed to anyone who </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to restrict free speech.</v>

1891
01:50:05.501 --> 01:50:06.334
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we deal with issues like death </v>

1892
01:50:08.021 --> 01:50:11.290
<v Speaker 2>threats or dishonest or pernicious to </v>
<v Speaker 2>advertise?</v>

1893
01:50:12.190 --> 01:50:13.023
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well are you saying we've already dealt </v>

1894
01:50:13.991 --> 01:50:16.240
<v Speaker 2>with that pretty nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there are,</v>

1895
01:50:16.270 --> 01:50:18.730
<v Speaker 2>there are limits to coerce a speech to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the be,</v>

1896
01:50:18.970 --> 01:50:21.440
<v Speaker 2>I think he was home law actually has </v>
<v Speaker 2>dealt with that very,</v>

1897
01:50:21.441 --> 01:50:23.620
<v Speaker 2>we see I'm a great admirer of English </v>
<v Speaker 2>common law,</v>

1898
01:50:23.830 --> 01:50:26.290
<v Speaker 2>English common wise and the whole legal </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

1899
01:50:26.291 --> 01:50:27.690
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just so you know,</v>

1900
01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:28.533
<v Speaker 2>cause you should've jumped because our </v>
<v Speaker 2>legal system is to come follow it up by </v>

1901
01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:33.790
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you call it?</v>

1902
01:50:33.820 --> 01:50:34.653
<v Speaker 2>Intro mission of French civil law </v>
<v Speaker 2>precepts into the English common law </v>

1903
01:50:38.051 --> 01:50:40.630
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is catastrophe in my estimation.</v>

1904
01:50:40.870 --> 01:50:41.703
<v Speaker 2>Under English common law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have all the rights there are and </v>

1905
01:50:44.741 --> 01:50:47.470
<v Speaker 2>are granted to you by the government you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

1906
01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:49.113
<v Speaker 2>And then what's happening in English on </v>
<v Speaker 2>laws when you have some rights and </v>

1907
01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:53.800
<v Speaker 2>rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>common had scrapped because you know,</v>

1908
01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:56.350
<v Speaker 2>you don't know where one right ends the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other who begins.</v>

1909
01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:57.273
<v Speaker 2>And so then we gave each other the court</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the court decides roughly </v>

1910
01:50:59.801 --> 01:51:00.634
<v Speaker 2>speaking where the line should be drawn </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the law of builds organically </v>

1911
01:51:03.791 --> 01:51:06.270
<v Speaker 2>across content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how do we,</v>

1912
01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:10.900
<v Speaker 2>now that it's come up with all sorts of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could call the limitations on,</v>

1913
01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:11.913
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say free speech precisely </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't really believe that </v>

1914
01:51:14.261 --> 01:51:15.760
<v Speaker 2>that's what they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm like,</v>

1915
01:51:15.761 --> 01:51:18.670
<v Speaker 2>you can't outrun death threats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1916
01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:19.593
<v Speaker 2>and I guess it's partly the paradoxical </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation where sometimes what you're </v>

1917
01:51:23.021 --> 01:51:23.854
<v Speaker 2>doing with your free speech is </v>
<v Speaker 2>interfering with the continuation of </v>

1918
01:51:27.041 --> 01:51:30.220
<v Speaker 2>free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in which case you should be saw.</v>

1919
01:51:30.270 --> 01:51:31.780
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1920
01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:32.673
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there should be limits on seditious </v>

1921
01:51:34.511 --> 01:51:38.080
<v Speaker 2>speech of some sort because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>treasonable speech.</v>

1922
01:51:38.081 --> 01:51:38.914
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I guess if what you're doing is </v>

1923
01:51:40.841 --> 01:51:41.674
<v Speaker 2>oriented towards demolishing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure upon which your own freedom </v>

1924
01:51:46.031 --> 01:51:49.360
<v Speaker 2>depends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then something has to be there has to be</v>

1925
01:51:49.361 --> 01:51:51.610
<v Speaker 2>eliminated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now where did evidence should be?</v>

1926
01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:55.200
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a tough one but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of that card would be seven.</v>

1927
01:51:55.230 --> 01:51:56.063
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's lots of things you can't ever </v>

1928
01:51:57.210 --> 01:52:00.160
<v Speaker 2>get France you can incite to criminal </v>
<v Speaker 2>activity,</v>

1929
01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:02.800
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can't blatantly lie if you are a</v>

1930
01:52:02.801 --> 01:52:06.900
<v Speaker 2>commercial vendor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact been tobacco for example.</v>

1931
01:52:06.901 --> 01:52:09.640
<v Speaker 2>And it has to be certain in the Supreme </v>
<v Speaker 2>Court and your ass,</v>

1932
01:52:09.820 --> 01:52:13.900
<v Speaker 2>you have to put warnings on your tobacco</v>
<v Speaker 2>product that's compelled speech,</v>

1933
01:52:13.901 --> 01:52:14.734
<v Speaker 2>which was what I was objecting to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feel see 16 but outside of the </v>

1934
01:52:17.261 --> 01:52:22.261
<v Speaker 2>commercial domain there hasn't been any </v>
<v Speaker 2>attempt to compel speech.</v>

1935
01:52:22.691 --> 01:52:26.380
<v Speaker 2>And that's how it should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think those things have to agree to</v>

1936
01:52:26.381 --> 01:52:30.190
<v Speaker 2>be dealt with on a case by case basis </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the devil's in the details.</v>

1937
01:52:30.340 --> 01:52:31.173
<v Speaker 2>And that's also why English common law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>such a staggeringly brilliant </v>

1938
01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:38.350
<v Speaker 2>contribution to world culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1939
01:52:38.380 --> 01:52:39.820
<v Speaker 2>if you want to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1940
01:52:39.821 --> 01:52:41.260
<v Speaker 2>is there any of your collectors for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

1941
01:52:41.261 --> 01:52:42.490
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1942
01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:46.070
<v Speaker 2>Most countries that we're founded on </v>
<v Speaker 2>English</v>

1943
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:51.070
<v Speaker 4>common law are rich</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the Americas.</v>

1944
01:52:51.710 --> 01:52:55.170
<v Speaker 4>Founded my friends core funded by </v>
<v Speaker 4>Portugal ports,</v>

1945
01:52:55.290 --> 01:52:56.123
<v Speaker 4>founded by Por [inaudible] rich.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So any sligo structure now that's my </v>

1946
01:53:02.190 --> 01:53:04.060
<v Speaker 4>home was a great book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

1947
01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:08.950
<v Speaker 4>What was it called?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The wealth and poverty of nations.</v>

1948
01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.800
<v Speaker 4>It was written by a Harvard professor </v>
<v Speaker 4>who analyzed,</v>

1949
01:53:11.980 --> 01:53:12.813
<v Speaker 4>he was very generous about why some </v>
<v Speaker 4>countries in the Americas we were </v>

1950
01:53:14.561 --> 01:53:15.394
<v Speaker 4>pouring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some are rich because they all have </v>

1951
01:53:16.481 --> 01:53:19.030
<v Speaker 4>natural resources,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going on.</v>

1952
01:53:19.510 --> 01:53:21.460
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then other countries like Japan,</v>

1953
01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:23.033
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need the resources and the rich are </v>

1954
01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:28.953
<v Speaker 4>functioning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Legal System said is the ultimate </v>

1955
01:53:30.580 --> 01:53:33.990
<v Speaker 4>attachment resources.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was becoming an yep.</v>

1956
01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:39.520
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

1957
01:53:40.450 --> 01:53:45.320
<v Speaker 4>this relates to Sam Harris has been set.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We will like it,</v>

1958
01:53:45.350 --> 01:53:46.850
<v Speaker 4>but I'm just gonna go with it if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't mind.</v>

1959
01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:50.300
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so why can't be subjective?</v>

1960
01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:51.350
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1961
01:53:51.351 --> 01:53:54.620
<v Speaker 4>luther and still fit into your </v>
<v Speaker 4>methodological perspective.</v>

1962
01:53:57.090 --> 01:53:59.880
<v Speaker 4>Well see the thing about a question like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1963
01:53:59.950 --> 01:54:00.783
<v Speaker 4>this is the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the truth about any question </v>

1964
01:54:03.511 --> 01:54:08.280
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you say is a equivalent to be,</v>

1965
01:54:09.860 --> 01:54:12.520
<v Speaker 4>the answer is it depends on how you </v>
<v Speaker 4>define it in your hands.</v>

1966
01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:15.920
<v Speaker 4>Now you'd find you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a weasel answer in some sense,</v>

1967
01:54:15.921 --> 01:54:16.754
<v Speaker 4>but it's actually the correct answer </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I can't answer that question </v>

1968
01:54:19.611 --> 01:54:20.444
<v Speaker 4>without knowing what you specifically </v>
<v Speaker 4>mean by illusion and specifically </v>

1969
01:54:25.941 --> 01:54:30.410
<v Speaker 4>meaning about the subject.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now and I would also say the question is</v>

1970
01:54:30.690 --> 01:54:35.690
<v Speaker 4>not that I didn't call because</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are referring to is not homogenous.</v>

1971
01:54:36.231 --> 01:54:39.620
<v Speaker 4>It's heterogeneous</v>
<v Speaker 4>of eyes,</v>

1972
01:54:40.230 --> 01:54:41.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>radiation,</v>

1973
01:54:41.450 --> 01:54:42.283
<v Speaker 4>something like harvey was something like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a unity after call and some of that of </v>

1974
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.823
<v Speaker 4>yours in some sense a losery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did he get in the same way that the </v>

1975
01:54:54.321 --> 01:54:56.530
<v Speaker 4>desktop on your computer isn't an </v>
<v Speaker 4>illusion.</v>

1976
01:54:56.531 --> 01:54:59.690
<v Speaker 4>The representation of the actual </v>
<v Speaker 4>computational processes,</v>

1977
01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:03.260
<v Speaker 4>it's more illusory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It its function.</v>

1978
01:55:05.060 --> 01:55:07.150
<v Speaker 4>If you're thinking about illusion as </v>
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>

1979
01:55:07.370 --> 01:55:08.203
<v Speaker 4>you see you have to define the physical </v>
<v Speaker 4>arena in which you were formulating the </v>

1980
01:55:11.931 --> 01:55:12.860
<v Speaker 4>concepts before.</v>

1981
01:55:12.860 --> 01:55:14.490
<v Speaker 4>We could have a proper discussion of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1982
01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:15.553
<v Speaker 4>Now that I would say the simple truth </v>
<v Speaker 4>that Ari and here too is that </v>

1983
01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:28.510
<v Speaker 4>civilizations that act as if human </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings have freewill seem to work.</v>

1984
01:55:30.530 --> 01:55:33.710
<v Speaker 4>Now that's a pragmatic didn't habits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1985
01:55:33.790 --> 01:55:34.623
<v Speaker 4>Sounds scientific,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm a pragmatist so that is pretty </v>

1986
01:55:37.401 --> 01:55:41.270
<v Speaker 4>far from me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so from a shorthand perspective,</v>

1987
01:55:41.271 --> 01:55:42.104
<v Speaker 4>I would say</v>
<v Speaker 4>if something is functional and it's </v>

1988
01:55:45.631 --> 01:55:46.464
<v Speaker 4>based on the particular first principle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first principle is true enough and </v>

1989
01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:52.913
<v Speaker 4>that's where I think about free will and</v>
<v Speaker 4>not sort of thing about the idea of the </v>

1990
01:55:54.811 --> 01:55:58.050
<v Speaker 4>soul.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm not saying that constitutes that</v>

1991
01:55:58.070 --> 01:56:01.410
<v Speaker 4>exhaustive analysis of freewill core of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the soul.</v>

1992
01:56:01.590 --> 01:56:02.423
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a good first pass </v>

1993
01:56:04.771 --> 01:56:09.771
<v Speaker 4>approximation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

1994
01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:16.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw him on your q and a's.</v>

1995
01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:19.800
<v Speaker 2>I hope this isn't too unrelated but it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably what we keep it lighter.</v>

1996
01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:20.753
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said that you're a big fan of a </v>

1997
01:56:22.501 --> 01:56:27.501
<v Speaker 2>guilty pleasure for trailer park boys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a brief sort of article,</v>

1998
01:56:33.930 --> 01:56:37.050
<v Speaker 2>well your hair characters and maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tie back to free speech.</v>

1999
01:56:37.051 --> 01:56:42.051
<v Speaker 2>How a show that is so crude and </v>
<v Speaker 2>offensive managers to be making the most</v>

2000
01:56:42.250 --> 01:56:43.083
<v Speaker 2>positive</v>

2001
01:56:51.310 --> 01:56:56.310
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2002
01:57:03.200 --> 01:57:08.200
<v Speaker 4>well I'm from northern Alberta.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you know the movie.</v>

2003
01:57:08.810 --> 01:57:10.830
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rhubarb.</v>

2004
01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:17.600
<v Speaker 4>I went foobar it's actually about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that I grew up with.</v>

2005
01:57:18.620 --> 01:57:23.060
<v Speaker 4>Pete to some degree having us watch for </v>
<v Speaker 4>the border</v>

2006
01:57:24.650 --> 01:57:25.483
<v Speaker 4>probably eight years ago because they </v>
<v Speaker 4>have one of my old friends and we were </v>

2007
01:57:31.160 --> 01:57:34.670
<v Speaker 4>scared of swatches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2008
01:57:35.170 --> 01:57:37.610
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something about,</v>

2009
01:57:37.670 --> 01:57:40.790
<v Speaker 4>I went to the class guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they're fighting,</v>

2010
01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:42.710
<v Speaker 4>they have great senses of humor and </v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

2011
01:57:42.711 --> 01:57:43.544
<v Speaker 4>I read this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the ways the working class guys </v>

2012
01:57:45.771 --> 01:57:50.160
<v Speaker 4>compete is through observing</v>
<v Speaker 4>for restaurants.</v>

2013
01:57:50.230 --> 01:57:54.680
<v Speaker 4>I heard lots of rough places,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rail crews and that sort of thing.</v>

2014
01:57:55.110 --> 01:57:58.370
<v Speaker 4>And what keeps guys alive in situations </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that?</v>

2015
01:57:58.371 --> 01:58:02.360
<v Speaker 4>Is there a certain sense of humor and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the training of our employees is a great</v>

2016
01:58:02.361 --> 01:58:05.510
<v Speaker 4>example that I think it's hilarious that</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Canadian government funds it.</v>

2017
01:58:08.220 --> 01:58:13.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is also the simpsons.</v>

2018
01:58:14.710 --> 01:58:19.710
<v Speaker 4>It's absolutely reprehensible in all of </v>
<v Speaker 4>its details except for its container,</v>

2019
01:58:22.420 --> 01:58:26.470
<v Speaker 4>the simpsons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The family is central to this instance,</v>

2020
01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:28.200
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well to say about homeowners,</v>

2021
01:58:28.220 --> 01:58:29.310
<v Speaker 4>like loves his family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

2022
01:58:29.370 --> 01:58:30.203
<v Speaker 4>anything for his family and </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamentally they're oriented towards </v>

2023
01:58:33.501 --> 01:58:34.334
<v Speaker 4>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's always a calming because </v>

2024
01:58:37.250 --> 01:58:40.820
<v Speaker 4>there anyhow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's what gives best what makes</v>

2025
01:58:40.821 --> 01:58:44.530
<v Speaker 4>the simpsons just mean spirited.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not mean spirited.</v>

2026
01:58:44.531 --> 01:58:46.370
<v Speaker 4>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Saqqara everyone's,</v>

2027
01:58:46.380 --> 01:58:51.380
<v Speaker 4>he held the Joe and the characters are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are essentially moral and it's the same,</v>

2028
01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:58.140
<v Speaker 4>somewhat lesser degree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2029
01:58:58.250 --> 01:59:00.760
<v Speaker 4>because the stories when it's working,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the story is,</v>

2030
01:59:00.761 --> 01:59:03.280
<v Speaker 4>well two things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's about impulsive,</v>

2031
01:59:03.700 --> 01:59:08.500
<v Speaker 4>male stupidity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>also friendship.</v>

2032
01:59:09.070 --> 01:59:12.120
<v Speaker 4>And it really is about friendship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even the enemies are friends.</v>

2033
01:59:12.460 --> 01:59:13.293
<v Speaker 4>And so the creative subject have done </v>
<v Speaker 4>this remarkable job of walking the line </v>

2034
01:59:17.711 --> 01:59:22.240
<v Speaker 4>between satirical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like English to meet needs.</v>

2035
01:59:22.430 --> 01:59:24.360
<v Speaker 4>It's great car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they have,</v>

2036
01:59:24.450 --> 01:59:29.450
<v Speaker 4>they have their characters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the characters completely reprehensible.</v>

2037
01:59:29.860 --> 01:59:34.380
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's part of why I left the street,</v>

2038
01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:35.593
<v Speaker 4>goes to Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think unbelievably funny because you </v>

2039
01:59:37.841 --> 01:59:42.140
<v Speaker 4>watch it then have this documentary like</v>
<v Speaker 4>aspect is easy,</v>

2040
01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:48.920
<v Speaker 4>but these are real people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Conky episode down.</v>

2041
02:00:06.260 --> 02:00:11.260
<v Speaker 4>I have a bucket list</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be invited on the trailer park.</v>

2042
02:00:19.680 --> 02:00:20.513
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2043
02:00:21.080 --> 02:00:23.610
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just have a question about,</v>

2044
02:00:23.850 --> 02:00:24.683
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your plane's on political belief and </v>

2045
02:00:28.261 --> 02:00:30.870
<v Speaker 4>direct correlation to big five </v>
<v Speaker 4>personality.</v>

2046
02:00:31.110 --> 02:00:32.660
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2047
02:00:32.700 --> 02:00:36.780
<v Speaker 4>you mentioned that there's truth ain't </v>
<v Speaker 4>truth be fighting it out in this between</v>

2048
02:00:36.781 --> 02:00:38.550
<v Speaker 4>the right and the left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2049
02:00:38.580 --> 02:00:39.413
<v Speaker 4>what do you mean pass the treaty?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which is what I see is emerging is the </v>

2050
02:00:44.131 --> 02:00:47.190
<v Speaker 4>libertarian movement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which isn't really in either category.</v>

2051
02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:50.233
<v Speaker 4>The first answer is I don't know enough </v>
<v Speaker 4>about libertarians to say because we </v>

2052
02:00:54.111 --> 02:00:55.690
<v Speaker 4>haven't been able to sample it off the </v>
<v Speaker 4>boat.</v>

2053
02:00:55.700 --> 02:01:00.700
<v Speaker 4>You get a sense now I shouldn't say that</v>
<v Speaker 4>the 23 correct types are not causing,</v>

2054
02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:02.833
<v Speaker 4>just so everyone knows the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 4>English or for the politically correct </v>

2055
02:01:05.721 --> 02:01:07.790
<v Speaker 4>heights is that they're very high in </v>
<v Speaker 4>agreeableness.</v>

2056
02:01:08.250 --> 02:01:08.861
<v Speaker 4>Anyone say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2057
02:01:08.861 --> 02:01:11.620
<v Speaker 4>I don't see very</v>
<v Speaker 4>real.</v>

2058
02:01:11.690 --> 02:01:16.160
<v Speaker 4>People are only agreeable to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if you're in their desk,</v>

2059
02:01:16.510 --> 02:01:17.343
<v Speaker 4>then you're gay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you're outside the nest or a </v>

2060
02:01:19.461 --> 02:01:22.370
<v Speaker 4>snake and so they're very agreeable </v>
<v Speaker 4>behaves,</v>

2061
02:01:22.371 --> 02:01:24.320
<v Speaker 4>but they're not very agreeable to </v>
<v Speaker 4>snakes.</v>

2062
02:01:24.380 --> 02:01:26.540
<v Speaker 4>And most people are snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2063
02:01:27.100 --> 02:01:27.933
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the is my suspicion is that there </v>

2064
02:01:30.211 --> 02:01:33.080
<v Speaker 4>are high in openness and high in </v>
<v Speaker 4>conscientiousness.</v>

2065
02:01:33.460 --> 02:01:34.940
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really don't know.</v>

2066
02:01:35.420 --> 02:01:38.330
<v Speaker 4>They may also not be very agreeable </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're kind of like,</v>

2067
02:01:38.331 --> 02:01:39.600
<v Speaker 4>leave me the hell times,</v>

2068
02:01:40.030 --> 02:01:41.890
<v Speaker 2>which kind of goes with the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that I,</v>

2069
02:01:41.980 --> 02:01:44.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm quite agreeable with the guests.</v>

2070
02:01:45.410 --> 02:01:48.980
<v Speaker 2>I find it really hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disagreeable types,</v>

2071
02:01:48.981 --> 02:01:49.814
<v Speaker 2>basically telling him to screw off and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that can be really useful because that </v>

2072
02:01:53.180 --> 02:01:58.180
<v Speaker 2>is what you should do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suspect that the Libertarians are more</v>

2073
02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:00.610
<v Speaker 2>disagreement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2074
02:02:04.050 --> 02:02:07.220
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

2075
02:02:09.330 --> 02:02:10.163
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you expressed some concern about </v>

2076
02:02:11.630 --> 02:02:14.990
<v Speaker 2>losing your job at University of Toronto</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was just wondering,</v>

2077
02:02:15.260 --> 02:02:18.680
<v Speaker 2>given that you're picture on income,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse my own salary,</v>

2078
02:02:19.960 --> 02:02:20.793
<v Speaker 2>is there a threshold at which you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>consider resigning and pursuing a </v>

2079
02:02:23.371 --> 02:02:26.060
<v Speaker 2>youtube just being oppression of youtube</v>
<v Speaker 2>as your primary?</v>

2080
02:02:27.290 --> 02:02:27.891
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2081
02:02:27.891 --> 02:02:30.170
<v Speaker 2>I thought about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as I said earlier,</v>

2082
02:02:30.171 --> 02:02:31.004
<v Speaker 2>I like to do both things at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and right now there's no reason to </v>

2083
02:02:35.001 --> 02:02:36.920
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have this great</v>

2084
02:02:38.450 --> 02:02:41.260
<v Speaker 2>professor and I should also say on </v>
<v Speaker 2>behalf of when students like,</v>

2085
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:42.103
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went back to teach in January and I </v>

2086
02:02:43.701 --> 02:02:46.940
<v Speaker 2>was not in very good shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have real health crisis in December,</v>

2087
02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:49.640
<v Speaker 2>which I think was unrelated to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not,</v>

2088
02:02:50.780 --> 02:02:53.420
<v Speaker 2>but I was reading on in good shape and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2089
02:02:53.720 --> 02:02:54.553
<v Speaker 2>I had been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it had been recommended to me by my </v>

2090
02:02:56.961 --> 02:02:57.650
<v Speaker 2>chair.</v>

2091
02:02:57.650 --> 02:02:58.483
<v Speaker 2>I'm not returned to teaching </v>
<v Speaker 2>independently of what was going on at </v>

2092
02:03:01.311 --> 02:03:02.890
<v Speaker 2>the university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no damn way.</v>

2093
02:03:03.390 --> 02:03:05.560
<v Speaker 2>I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2094
02:03:05.800 --> 02:03:06.633
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wasn't clear to me how much </v>

2095
02:03:09.110 --> 02:03:11.730
<v Speaker 2>additional stress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to kill the target.</v>

2096
02:03:12.290 --> 02:03:13.123
<v Speaker 2>Or the students were extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>well and he knows the students at the </v>

2097
02:03:17.451 --> 02:03:21.170
<v Speaker 2>university trav and most students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of them are kids,</v>

2098
02:03:21.171 --> 02:03:22.620
<v Speaker 2>are first generation immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2099
02:03:22.621 --> 02:03:23.454
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're on a bloody political </v>
<v Speaker 2>bandwagons frame from their economic </v>

2100
02:03:27.171 --> 02:03:31.370
<v Speaker 2>future there post powered by the dreams </v>
<v Speaker 2>and desires of their parents,</v>

2101
02:03:31.430 --> 02:03:34.540
<v Speaker 2>and I'm working in south down to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tailbone.</v>

2102
02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:36.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to get her degree in new up </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

2103
02:03:36.321 --> 02:03:38.830
<v Speaker 2>It'd be functioning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I liked the undergraduates.</v>

2104
02:03:39.130 --> 02:03:42.410
<v Speaker 2>It a small percentage of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is Paris laws the same?</v>

2105
02:03:42.411 --> 02:03:47.060
<v Speaker 2>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2106
02:03:52.660 --> 02:03:54.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know how many of them are </v>
<v Speaker 2>students for now.</v>

2107
02:03:55.090 --> 02:03:57.480
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the administrative </v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

2108
02:03:57.960 --> 02:04:01.120
<v Speaker 2>a fair number of the sites who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>politically correct,</v>

2109
02:04:01.210 --> 02:04:05.980
<v Speaker 2>but the university itself is actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite conservative in the small sisense.</v>

2110
02:04:06.140 --> 02:04:06.973
<v Speaker 2>Now that's annoying sometimes because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm right radical from a creative </v>

2111
02:04:10.451 --> 02:04:14.220
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I find we have some constraints,</v>

2112
02:04:14.560 --> 02:04:15.393
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got nothing to complain about this </v>

2113
02:04:17.380 --> 02:04:18.700
<v Speaker 2>with the rest of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a highly,</v>

2114
02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:20.890
<v Speaker 2>highly privileged job and thrilled to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

2115
02:04:20.930 --> 02:04:24.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm lucky to have it fortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like teaching young people.</v>

2116
02:04:25.090 --> 02:04:25.923
<v Speaker 2>It's a great privilege to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I don't see any reason to stop </v>

2117
02:04:29.530 --> 02:04:32.860
<v Speaker 2>and I think there can be both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so far that's working.</v>

2118
02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:37.860
<v Speaker 2>So as long as the loan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is my libertarian aside,</v>

2119
02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:38.040
<v Speaker 2>as</v>

2120
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:40.150
<v Speaker 4>long as I left alone by the university </v>
<v Speaker 4>and my gender,</v>

2121
02:04:40.190 --> 02:04:43.320
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then I can have my cake and eat it too.</v>

2122
02:04:43.950 --> 02:04:48.950
<v Speaker 4>And so that's a good deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2123
02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:58.160
<v Speaker 4>so earlier in your speech and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>mentioned how the length generally</v>

2124
02:05:01.140 --> 02:05:04.890
<v Speaker 4>kind of come to the aid of who they </v>
<v Speaker 4>perceive at as oppressed.</v>

2125
02:05:04.980 --> 02:05:06.240
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2126
02:05:06.270 --> 02:05:09.730
<v Speaker 4>so I kind of view,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2127
02:05:09.870 --> 02:05:14.010
<v Speaker 4>the rights as being sort of a price on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the left to myself.</v>

2128
02:05:14.610 --> 02:05:15.443
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think my perception is correct </v>

2129
02:05:18.840 --> 02:05:22.230
<v Speaker 4>and if so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why do you think that the social justice</v>

2130
02:05:22.231 --> 02:05:25.680
<v Speaker 4>type don't also see it like I did?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2131
02:05:25.681 --> 02:05:26.311
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2132
02:05:26.311 --> 02:05:27.910
<v Speaker 4>we're in a time of cat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2133
02:05:27.930 --> 02:05:32.930
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that [inaudible] times things </v>
<v Speaker 4>reverse in twists and,</v>

2134
02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:39.833
<v Speaker 4>and we're in many and I believe that </v>
<v Speaker 4>where I do believe that that's </v>

2135
02:05:43.990 --> 02:05:48.990
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] main process has emerged</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the left or pressing the right,</v>

2136
02:06:00.190 --> 02:06:01.023
<v Speaker 4>I think it's more like the left has </v>
<v Speaker 4>gained the routing color as being </v>

2137
02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:08.103
<v Speaker 4>incremental control over many </v>
<v Speaker 4>institutions as a consequence of </v>

2138
02:06:12.271 --> 02:06:17.271
<v Speaker 4>inappropriate public subsidy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there not that many of them.</v>

2139
02:06:19.850 --> 02:06:24.850
<v Speaker 4>There are whole disciplines that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>pathologically etiological possess,</v>

2140
02:06:27.020 --> 02:06:27.853
<v Speaker 4>which like the ethnic studies waiting </v>
<v Speaker 4>studies types where the studies in </v>

2141
02:06:31.441 --> 02:06:32.274
<v Speaker 4>particular it's complaining of hospital</v>
<v Speaker 4>and increasingly the humanities are </v>

2142
02:06:37.751 --> 02:06:42.751
<v Speaker 4>being pulled into that vortex that have </v>
<v Speaker 4>postmodernism two thirds of the way down</v>

2143
02:06:44.411 --> 02:06:45.780
<v Speaker 4>to Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Underneath that,</v>

2144
02:06:47.160 --> 02:06:48.450
<v Speaker 4>the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that</v>

2145
02:06:49.980 --> 02:06:50.813
<v Speaker 4>set up a system where people are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that orientation can draw a stable cell </v>

2146
02:06:58.590 --> 02:07:01.470
<v Speaker 4>for decades.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's thousands of them,</v>

2147
02:07:01.530 --> 02:07:04.950
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of thousands perhaps and do </v>
<v Speaker 4>nots.</v>

2148
02:07:05.370 --> 02:07:09.600
<v Speaker 4>But we're on what they say demo on which</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the underlining of the patriarchy,</v>

2149
02:07:10.140 --> 02:07:12.210
<v Speaker 4>which is a reprehensible term.</v>
<v Speaker 4>By the way.</v>

2150
02:07:12.270 --> 02:07:13.103
<v Speaker 4>It's a wrongful oversimplification of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the estate and it's also profoundly the </v>

2151
02:07:17.221 --> 02:07:18.054
<v Speaker 4>ungrateful because although the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Patriarchy is an oppressive structure </v>

2152
02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:26.720
<v Speaker 4>obviously because any social community </v>
<v Speaker 4>requires conformity or it's not a social</v>

2153
02:07:26.731 --> 02:07:27.564
<v Speaker 4>community,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also staggered in a productive and </v>

2154
02:07:30.840 --> 02:07:35.530
<v Speaker 4>for example provides them with a degree </v>
<v Speaker 4>of safety and security.</v>

2155
02:07:35.531 --> 02:07:36.364
<v Speaker 4>This unthinkable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well they pursued their fifth call </v>

2156
02:07:41.221 --> 02:07:45.310
<v Speaker 4>agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've got to stop.</v>

2157
02:07:46.120 --> 02:07:49.490
<v Speaker 4>It's not acceptable and the way we </v>
<v Speaker 4>started in parties,</v>

2158
02:07:49.900 --> 02:07:53.450
<v Speaker 4>Harrods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't let your children take you.</v>

2159
02:07:53.451 --> 02:07:54.284
<v Speaker 4>Never of course</v>

2160
02:07:55.810 --> 02:08:00.810
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible].</v>

2161
02:08:03.380 --> 02:08:05.780
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking about doing this,</v>

2162
02:08:07.210 --> 02:08:09.500
<v Speaker 4>and this would be a great crowd source </v>
<v Speaker 4>project.</v>

2163
02:08:09.790 --> 02:08:10.623
<v Speaker 4>I would like to make up a technical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I can do a technical analysis of </v>

2164
02:08:16.480 --> 02:08:21.480
<v Speaker 4>postmodern slash Marxist slash social </v>
<v Speaker 4>justice terminology,</v>

2165
02:08:21.711 --> 02:08:26.110
<v Speaker 4>you'd be working on that already.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then great course descriptions,</v>

2166
02:08:26.390 --> 02:08:30.460
<v Speaker 4>how of course descriptions raging fires </v>
<v Speaker 4>and publish them.</v>

2167
02:08:31.170 --> 02:08:32.003
<v Speaker 4>And so then with brain corridor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>universities and colleges by social </v>

2168
02:08:35.621 --> 02:08:36.454
<v Speaker 4>justice infiltration and to do this and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that and produce a manual for parents </v>

2169
02:08:42.371 --> 02:08:43.204
<v Speaker 4>and high school students that would say </v>
<v Speaker 4>who not to take courses in which horses </v>

2170
02:08:47.651 --> 02:08:48.484
<v Speaker 4>and you avoid because I think that </v>
<v Speaker 4>starving them out is the right approach </v>

2171
02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:55.480
<v Speaker 4>and it's going to be difficult because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll take your,</v>

2172
02:08:56.270 --> 02:09:00.940
<v Speaker 4>and I've been an admirer of 10 but the </v>
<v Speaker 4>system's gone sideways,</v>

2173
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:02.910
<v Speaker 4>that there was a way of exploiting it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2174
02:09:02.911 --> 02:09:04.540
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's being exploited.</v>

2175
02:09:04.600 --> 02:09:05.433
<v Speaker 4>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many of you guys fall </v>

2176
02:09:07.141 --> 02:09:07.974
<v Speaker 4>real peer review cat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would recommend that one player that </v>

2177
02:09:11.261 --> 02:09:15.100
<v Speaker 4>you want to see what the pathological </v>
<v Speaker 4>humor,</v>

<v Speaker 4>described the real peer review and it's </v>

2179
02:09:20.981 --> 02:09:23.290
<v Speaker 4>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2180
02:09:23.620 --> 02:09:28.320
<v Speaker 4>it's far more observant than to on</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2181
02:09:29.260 --> 02:09:34.260
<v Speaker 4>so I don't remember what your question</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically is the oppressor to right.</v>

<v Speaker 4>oppressing the culture now with that and</v>

2185
02:09:49.361 --> 02:09:53.560
<v Speaker 4>that translates to some degree into what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're disruptive.</v>
