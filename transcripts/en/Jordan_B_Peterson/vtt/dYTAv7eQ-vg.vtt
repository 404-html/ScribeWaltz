1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.780
<v Speaker 1>There'll be an exam on Thursday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I presume it'll be multiple choice.</v>

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.780
<v Speaker 1>Like the last one was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.070
<v Speaker 1>you've already taken one exam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you kind of have some idea about what</v>

4
00:00:11.071 --> 00:00:12.510
<v Speaker 1>they're like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

5
00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:13.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll be here,</v>

6
00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:15.870
<v Speaker 1>like the last one was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.390
<v Speaker 1>and this lecture will be covered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

8
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.793
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we talked a little bit about </v>

9
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:26.010
<v Speaker 1>motivation last time or quite a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>about motivation and what I,</v>

10
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.100
<v Speaker 1>I told you that I was basically teach </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

11
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.430
<v Speaker 1>teaching you a personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroscience approach to personality.</v>

12
00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:33.264
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason that I have to go </v>

13
00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:40.380
<v Speaker 1>into the biology to give you is to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>you the kind of foundation that you need</v>

14
00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:41.214
<v Speaker 1>in order to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say what's essentially the </v>

15
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:45.840
<v Speaker 1>cutting edge in personality research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

16
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that what we're going,</v>

17
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.543
<v Speaker 1>what we covered last lecture and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to cover today are </v>

18
00:00:53.131 --> 00:00:54.300
<v Speaker 1>relatively complicated.</v>

19
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.540
<v Speaker 1>But if you get them right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're right at the forefront of,</v>

20
00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.073
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our ideas about brain function and </v>

21
00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:04.620
<v Speaker 1>emotion and about personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get all that at the same time.</v>

22
00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:07.740
<v Speaker 1>And today you'll get a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning theory thrown in as well.</v>

23
00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:11.350
<v Speaker 1>So the learn learning theory is </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically what used to be,</v>

24
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 1>what's what's alternatively described as</v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviorism.</v>

25
00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:15.324
<v Speaker 1>And I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to teach behaviorism in this </v>

26
00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:18.024
<v Speaker 1>class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've subsumed it underneath the </v>

27
00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:23.730
<v Speaker 1>biology because the old be a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>old behavior of presuppositions,</v>

28
00:01:23.731 --> 00:01:27.420
<v Speaker 1>although they were extremely useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not right is,</v>

29
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.710
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what you'd expect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were formulated in the 1950s.</v>

30
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.933
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's actually the sign of the </v>

31
00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:37.710
<v Speaker 1>progress of a science that theories that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are 60 years old or no longer.</v>

32
00:01:37.711 --> 00:01:39.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

33
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.273
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll also cover a little bit of </v>

34
00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:43.950
<v Speaker 1>behavioral theory today too.</v>

35
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.420
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

36
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:47.910
<v Speaker 1>So the hypothesis we've been working on </v>
<v Speaker 1>so far,</v>

37
00:01:47.911 --> 00:01:48.744
<v Speaker 1>or we'll call it the working theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that motivations set goals or more </v>

38
00:01:53.221 --> 00:01:54.054
<v Speaker 1>accurately that they defined a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptual space within which you </v>

39
00:01:57.481 --> 00:02:01.860
<v Speaker 1>perceive the world and within which you </v>
<v Speaker 1>act towards some goal and,</v>

40
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.903
<v Speaker 1>or to some endpoint and the endpoint in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense as specified by the </v>

41
00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:10.800
<v Speaker 1>motivational system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a hypothalamic system are often,</v>

42
00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:11.634
<v Speaker 1>but not always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not only is the goal specified but </v>

43
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.000
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the underlying motivational systems also</v>

44
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:18.834
<v Speaker 1>tune your perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're only looking at the things </v>

45
00:02:20.851 --> 00:02:23.550
<v Speaker 1>that you know to be relevant to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuit of that goal.</v>

46
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.530
<v Speaker 1>And they also either disinhibit or </v>
<v Speaker 1>activate the behavioral schemes that you</v>

47
00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:33.480
<v Speaker 1>would normally use to pursue the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes those are the,</v>

48
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.000
<v Speaker 1>let's say the motor schemes cause that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be more accurate.</v>

49
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.103
<v Speaker 1>When you think about behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tend to think about voluntary </v>

50
00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:43.350
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a motivational state will disinhibit</v>

51
00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:46.950
<v Speaker 1>or activate depending on the situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>autonomic responses.</v>

52
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.630
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

53
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.913
<v Speaker 1>when you were food deprived and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to think about food and start to </v>

54
00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:53.634
<v Speaker 1>organize your behavior towards food as </v>
<v Speaker 1>an end and to perceive the world that </v>

55
00:02:57.001 --> 00:02:59.010
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body also prepares for.</v>

56
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.513
<v Speaker 1>And so the motivational state is an all </v>
<v Speaker 1>encompassing psychophysiological </v>

57
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:05.224
<v Speaker 1>phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not something as simple as chain </v>

58
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:07.534
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was an early be behavioral theory </v>

59
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.180
<v Speaker 1>or as simple as something that's merely </v>
<v Speaker 1>setting a goal.</v>

60
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:15.220
<v Speaker 1>It's much more complicated than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

61
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.173
<v Speaker 1>it's useful to think about as we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>already talked about with regards to </v>

62
00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:20.884
<v Speaker 1>psychodynamic theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's useful to think about a motivated </v>

63
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:25.770
<v Speaker 1>state as a micro personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

64
00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:28.240
<v Speaker 1>it's got one aim in mind fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

65
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:29.074
<v Speaker 1>it's not particularly sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has all the other elements of a </v>

66
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:34.420
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now,</v>

67
00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:35.254
<v Speaker 1>so motivation establishes the framework </v>
<v Speaker 1>within which goals are pursued and the </v>

68
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:44.161
<v Speaker 1>goal itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then roughly speaking emotions or at</v>

69
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:47.830
<v Speaker 1>least many of the motions track progress</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards goals.</v>

70
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.890
<v Speaker 1>And so they kind of tell you whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on the right tracker or not.</v>

71
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 1>So that's a reasonable way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinguishing them.</v>

72
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.653
<v Speaker 1>Even though there is no single </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation system or a single emotion </v>

73
00:03:58.781 --> 00:04:03.010
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some basic motivations.</v>

74
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.410
<v Speaker 1>These are the sorts of things that Freud</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have associated fundamentally with</v>

75
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.890
<v Speaker 1>Id.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

76
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:09.724
<v Speaker 1>and he thought of those as primordial </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's exactly right because pretty </v>

77
00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:13.384
<v Speaker 1>much all of these motivational systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>we share certainly with other people </v>

78
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.000
<v Speaker 1>also with other mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course with animals that are</v>

79
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.700
<v Speaker 1>farther down the evolutionary chain than</v>
<v Speaker 1>mammals.</v>

80
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.040
<v Speaker 1>So some of these systems are </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily old.</v>

81
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.053
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them are extraordinarily old </v>

82
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.660
<v Speaker 1>hunger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of food deprivation,</v>

83
00:04:31.661 --> 00:04:32.494
<v Speaker 1>obviously thirst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously people are very dependent on </v>

84
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.230
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pain,</v>

85
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.270
<v Speaker 1>pain's complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

86
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.553
<v Speaker 1>there's physical pain and then there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's mental equivalents and the mental </v>

87
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:51.871
<v Speaker 1>equivalents of pain are grief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointment,</v>

88
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.820
<v Speaker 1>frustration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

89
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.090
<v Speaker 1>And so you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you can think about that as you,</v>

90
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.953
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw the picture of the nervous </v>

91
00:04:58.781 --> 00:04:59.614
<v Speaker 1>system that I showed you last time with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the branches going up into the brain </v>

92
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.393
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with all the branches or the roots </v>

93
00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:05.704
<v Speaker 1>say going down into the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we discussed the central nervous </v>

94
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:12.340
<v Speaker 1>system as a sort of all encompassing </v>
<v Speaker 1>system distributed throughout the body.</v>

95
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:14.503
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that part of that network </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout your body is associated with </v>

96
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.800
<v Speaker 1>pain reception and that would be roughly</v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to systems registering levels</v>

97
00:05:24.161 --> 00:05:27.190
<v Speaker 1>of input that are high enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially damage them.</v>

98
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.470
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where pain seems seems to come in</v>

99
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.280
<v Speaker 1>and that different pieces of that can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>activated at different times.</v>

100
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.550
<v Speaker 1>So if it's psychological pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

101
00:05:36.551 --> 00:05:37.750
<v Speaker 1>grief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frustration,</v>

102
00:05:37.751 --> 00:05:40.060
<v Speaker 1>disappointment seems to fall into that </v>
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>

103
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.220
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loneliness as another one.</v>

104
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.593
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe it's primarily the cortical </v>

105
00:05:46.751 --> 00:05:48.660
<v Speaker 1>circuitry for paying that's activated.</v>

106
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Although people who are depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

107
00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:54.070
<v Speaker 1>or who are grieving often have somatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain as well.</v>

108
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.830
<v Speaker 1>And depression really looks like it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain state.</v>

109
00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.163
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know loneliness is because if you </v>

110
00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:00.374
<v Speaker 1>take like little chicks or little </v>
<v Speaker 1>kittens and you make them loan and </v>

111
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.730
<v Speaker 1>they'll cry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

112
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:05.564
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

113
00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:06.170
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

114
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.640
<v Speaker 1>or peep if their chicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can stop them from doing that by</v>

115
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:11.474
<v Speaker 1>using opiates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not because it stops them from </v>

116
00:06:15.261 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 1>vocalizing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause that would be a possibility.</v>

117
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:18.740
<v Speaker 1>Just get them so stoned on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

118
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:20.870
<v Speaker 1>morphine that they can't peep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

119
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:23.690
<v Speaker 1>well they're now they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not lonesome anymore sites.</v>

120
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.823
<v Speaker 1>The experiments have been done carefully</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to factor out the effect of the </v>

121
00:06:28.041 --> 00:06:30.080
<v Speaker 1>opiates on the vocalization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

122
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.093
<v Speaker 1>and that's also led to some suspicion </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people who have have had to have a </v>

123
00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:37.814
<v Speaker 1>history of extraordinarily painful </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal relationships might be those </v>

124
00:06:41.181 --> 00:06:43.520
<v Speaker 1>who are more prone to opiate use.</v>

125
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.070
<v Speaker 1>And so opiates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>analgesics are,</v>

126
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.600
<v Speaker 1>they basically dampen out pain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>frustration and disappointment and grief</v>

127
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:51.583
<v Speaker 1>and loneliness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's an anger and aggression </v>

128
00:06:54.141 --> 00:06:55.700
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's complicated.</v>

129
00:06:55.701 --> 00:06:58.340
<v Speaker 1>There's probably two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is defensive aggression,</v>

130
00:06:58.341 --> 00:07:01.040
<v Speaker 1>that's probably more associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism.</v>

131
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.520
<v Speaker 1>Technically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The others probably predatory aggression</v>

132
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.013
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings are definitely predators </v>

133
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.520
<v Speaker 1>were meat eaters and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

134
00:07:10.521 --> 00:07:12.980
<v Speaker 1>our closest relatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees for example,</v>

135
00:07:12.981 --> 00:07:14.300
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty good hunters.</v>

136
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.033
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

137
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.083
<v Speaker 1>they'll pack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gathered together and packs and bring </v>

138
00:07:18.921 --> 00:07:19.754
<v Speaker 1>down 30 pound colobus monkeys and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the meat is very popular among the </v>

139
00:07:22.731 --> 00:07:23.564
<v Speaker 1>chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so predatory aggression seems to be </v>

140
00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:28.880
<v Speaker 1>a separate circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as we'll discuss further along,</v>

141
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.320
<v Speaker 1>I think the predatory aggression circuit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the maternal solicitude circuit,</v>

142
00:07:33.321 --> 00:07:34.154
<v Speaker 1>because there's also a care circuit have</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved to be at opposite ends of the </v>

143
00:07:38.331 --> 00:07:39.164
<v Speaker 1>same distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the agreeableness </v>

144
00:07:40.791 --> 00:07:42.410
<v Speaker 1>distribution in the big five.</v>

145
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.650
<v Speaker 1>So on one end there's maternal </v>
<v Speaker 1>solicitude and the other end,</v>

146
00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:46.484
<v Speaker 1>there's predatory aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could imagine how those things </v>

147
00:07:48.681 --> 00:07:50.990
<v Speaker 1>have to inhibit one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

148
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.220
<v Speaker 1>because well with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with many mammals,</v>

149
00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.370
<v Speaker 1>bears for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the males are so predatory that you have</v>

150
00:07:58.371 --> 00:08:00.770
<v Speaker 1>to keep them away from the cubs because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll kill them.</v>

151
00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:01.913
<v Speaker 1>You human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's some aggression towards </v>

152
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:06.103
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if the children aren't </v>

153
00:08:07.011 --> 00:08:07.844
<v Speaker 1>biological relatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but men are pretty caring for male </v>

154
00:08:10.971 --> 00:08:15.070
<v Speaker 1>mammals and women are actually quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory for male mammals.</v>

155
00:08:15.071 --> 00:08:15.904
<v Speaker 1>So thermal regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your hypothalamus takes care of whether </v>

156
00:08:19.191 --> 00:08:23.600
<v Speaker 1>you're hot or cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>panic and escape that those are circuits</v>

157
00:08:23.601 --> 00:08:26.750
<v Speaker 1>that also seem to be associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>with pain fundamentally.</v>

158
00:08:26.751 --> 00:08:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Although threat can maybe trigger them </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>

159
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:30.403
<v Speaker 1>and the panic escape system doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly seem to be the same system as </v>

160
00:08:33.771 --> 00:08:34.604
<v Speaker 1>the anxiety and fear system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though they sound they sound </v>

161
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.020
<v Speaker 1>roughly equivalent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

162
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.980
<v Speaker 1>You might think of panic as just the </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme level of fear.</v>

163
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:44.323
<v Speaker 1>I think fear can trigger panic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but panic seems to be a more primordial </v>

164
00:08:46.881 --> 00:08:51.881
<v Speaker 1>circuit and if you're panicking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an immense impetus to to escape.</v>

165
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.590
<v Speaker 1>So that's a different circuit </v>
<v Speaker 1>affiliation of care.</v>

166
00:08:55.591 --> 00:08:59.130
<v Speaker 1>We covered sexual desire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration and play.</v>

167
00:08:59.131 --> 00:09:00.930
<v Speaker 1>Both of those seem to be separate </v>
<v Speaker 1>circuits,</v>

168
00:09:00.931 --> 00:09:01.920
<v Speaker 1>so Jaak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Panksepp,</v>

169
00:09:01.921 --> 00:09:05.910
<v Speaker 1>Jaak Panksepp actually who wrote a great</v>
<v Speaker 1>book called an affect of neuroscience.</v>

170
00:09:05.911 --> 00:09:09.030
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if any of you are interested in like the</v>

171
00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:11.520
<v Speaker 1>psychobiology of behavior and </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation,</v>

172
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:15.930
<v Speaker 1>Jaak Panksepp book is one of the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a paper by him in,</v>

173
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.360
<v Speaker 1>in our collection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's a very smart guy.</v>

174
00:09:18.361 --> 00:09:22.650
<v Speaker 1>He wrote this book called affective </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroscience and it's actually given its</v>

175
00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:26.130
<v Speaker 1>title and the relative complexity of its</v>
<v Speaker 1>of its thoughts.</v>

176
00:09:26.131 --> 00:09:28.710
<v Speaker 1>It's actually quite readable even though</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a text,</v>

177
00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:31.110
<v Speaker 1>it's a little more personal than your </v>
<v Speaker 1>typical texts.</v>

178
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An panksepp is also very interested in a</v>

179
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:38.100
<v Speaker 1>psychodynamic and personality idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's a very broad thinker.</v>

180
00:09:38.101 --> 00:09:40.980
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

181
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:41.843
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an approach to psychology that sort of </v>

182
00:09:43.111 --> 00:09:43.944
<v Speaker 1>crosses the threshold from personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>into emotion and biology Panksepp as </v>

183
00:09:48.661 --> 00:09:49.494
<v Speaker 1>well as gray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a great paper that you're </v>

184
00:09:50.551 --> 00:09:52.530
<v Speaker 1>reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Panksepp's are very,</v>

185
00:09:52.531 --> 00:09:54.420
<v Speaker 1>very good source.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a very,</v>

186
00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.320
<v Speaker 1>he discovered the play circuit for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

187
00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he also discovered that rats laugh.</v>

188
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.690
<v Speaker 1>So if you take a rat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it laughs.</v>

189
00:10:06.691 --> 00:10:10.800
<v Speaker 1>You can't hear it though because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>laughs ultrasonically like a bat.</v>

190
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:16.130
<v Speaker 1>But if you record the rat giggling and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then slow down the tape,</v>

191
00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:19.590
<v Speaker 1>then you can tell that the rat laughs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rats need to play in.</v>

192
00:10:19.591 --> 00:10:21.960
<v Speaker 1>Most mammals need to play in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

193
00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.060
<v Speaker 1>socialize them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

194
00:10:24.061 --> 00:10:26.580
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things you can think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this when your parents do,</v>

195
00:10:26.581 --> 00:10:27.414
<v Speaker 1>and this is probably especially relevant</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the man cause one of the things you </v>

196
00:10:29.881 --> 00:10:33.060
<v Speaker 1>might ask is what role do men play in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the socialization of children?</v>

197
00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:33.893
<v Speaker 1>And one thing that men really do seem to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do with kids is to engage in rough and </v>

198
00:10:37.111 --> 00:10:37.944
<v Speaker 1>tumble play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially once they're a little older </v>

199
00:10:39.601 --> 00:10:43.140
<v Speaker 1>than to say two to five or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And kids love that.</v>

200
00:10:43.141 --> 00:10:47.230
<v Speaker 1>They absolutely love rough and tumble </v>
<v Speaker 1>play gets them so excited that you know,</v>

201
00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.113
<v Speaker 1>they get out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally rough and tumble play is </v>

202
00:10:50.671 --> 00:10:51.504
<v Speaker 1>an excellent mode of socialization </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it teaches the child that just </v>

203
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:59.670
<v Speaker 1>the distinction between aggression and </v>
<v Speaker 1>too much aggression,</v>

204
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you're wrestling with the kid,</v>

205
00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:07.130
<v Speaker 1>the kid has to keep their behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 1>output under a fair degree of control to</v>

206
00:11:07.471 --> 00:11:10.320
<v Speaker 1>keep the game going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make it rough enough to be exciting.</v>

207
00:11:10.321 --> 00:11:12.510
<v Speaker 1>But not so rough that they get hurt or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

208
00:11:12.511 --> 00:11:15.120
<v Speaker 1>that they stick their thumb in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>dad's I or something like that.</v>

209
00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:19.350
<v Speaker 1>And you can think of that from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Piagetian sense too because it's a game.</v>

210
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:20.183
<v Speaker 1>But imagine that if you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to configure yourself </v>

211
00:11:23.221 --> 00:11:27.180
<v Speaker 1>around other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't had that rough and tumble</v>

212
00:11:27.181 --> 00:11:28.014
<v Speaker 1>play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't really know where the </v>

213
00:11:28.741 --> 00:11:31.020
<v Speaker 1>boundaries of your body are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

214
00:11:31.021 --> 00:11:33.450
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't know how much you can take</v>

215
00:11:33.451 --> 00:11:34.284
<v Speaker 1>and how much you can be stretched and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how much you can be thrown around and </v>

216
00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:40.390
<v Speaker 1>when something actually hurts rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than this frightening.</v>

217
00:11:40.391 --> 00:11:43.170
<v Speaker 1>And so all of that intense sort of play </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

218
00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:44.363
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

219
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:48.060
<v Speaker 1>that boys in particular are likely to </v>
<v Speaker 1>engage in all the girls also.</v>

220
00:11:48.061 --> 00:11:48.894
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it</v>

221
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:55.040
<v Speaker 1>seems to be very useful for teaching </v>
<v Speaker 1>children about to engage with the world,</v>

222
00:11:55.481 --> 00:11:57.640
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and with other people in a physical way.</v>

223
00:11:57.641 --> 00:11:58.474
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the physiological </v>
<v Speaker 1>foundations for higher order </v>

224
00:12:00.851 --> 00:12:03.880
<v Speaker 1>socialization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very useful.</v>

225
00:12:03.881 --> 00:12:04.714
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've often noted the children who </v>

226
00:12:06.191 --> 00:12:09.340
<v Speaker 1>haven't had the opportunity to engage in</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical play.</v>

227
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.140
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of awkward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

228
00:12:11.141 --> 00:12:11.974
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>

229
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:12.873
<v Speaker 1>they're not seated well in their body </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like they're kind of vague </v>

230
00:12:15.371 --> 00:12:16.204
<v Speaker 1>physically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the ones who've been twisted </v>

231
00:12:17.831 --> 00:12:20.740
<v Speaker 1>around and Banton thrown up in the air </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

232
00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:21.574
<v Speaker 1>wrestled in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot more conscious of their </v>

233
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:25.443
<v Speaker 1>limits and their abilities and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>body and they're also much more able to </v>

234
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.010
<v Speaker 1>invite other kids to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think about this with regards to</v>

235
00:12:33.011 --> 00:12:33.844
<v Speaker 1>dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

236
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:35.710
<v Speaker 1>if you have a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the dog,</v>

237
00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.600
<v Speaker 1>you can tell when the dog wants to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

238
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:39.160
<v Speaker 1>What does the dog do?</v>

239
00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:42.523
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

240
00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.900
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It jumps around and it puts its rear end</v>

241
00:12:44.901 --> 00:12:47.600
<v Speaker 1>in the air often and its head down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks up,</v>

242
00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:48.763
<v Speaker 1>which is a little bit submissive and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit friendly and it wags its </v>

243
00:12:51.651 --> 00:12:52.484
<v Speaker 1>tail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might bark and it moves back and </v>

244
00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:56.240
<v Speaker 1>forth and like little kids that want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>play do well.</v>

245
00:12:56.241 --> 00:12:58.100
<v Speaker 1>They don't put their tails in the air </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

246
00:12:58.101 --> 00:12:59.190
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

247
00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.073
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they engage in like play invitation </v>

248
00:13:02.001 --> 00:13:03.410
<v Speaker 1>behaviors like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

249
00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:04.483
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of teasing sometimes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to get some play </v>

250
00:13:06.981 --> 00:13:07.814
<v Speaker 1>initiated down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also practice for later dominance </v>

251
00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:15.830
<v Speaker 1>when chimps play the males in particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>as they approach adolescence,</v>

252
00:13:15.831 --> 00:13:16.664
<v Speaker 1>the play behavior cause they'll all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll throw sticks at the old chimps </v>

253
00:13:19.671 --> 00:13:23.210
<v Speaker 1>who were laying down and sleeping or </v>
<v Speaker 1>come up and poke them or tease them.</v>

254
00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:24.403
<v Speaker 1>And then as they become more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful and more and more adolescents </v>

255
00:13:28.281 --> 00:13:29.114
<v Speaker 1>say you need to at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I did not play will become full </v>

256
00:13:30.801 --> 00:13:31.634
<v Speaker 1>blown dominance challenges as you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt noticed if you were in junior </v>

257
00:13:35.451 --> 00:13:38.510
<v Speaker 1>high school because that's exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to teachers,</v>

258
00:13:38.511 --> 00:13:38.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

259
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:39.583
<v Speaker 1>The little elementary school kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of cute when they </v>

260
00:13:41.361 --> 00:13:42.194
<v Speaker 1>misbehave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's sort of playful but by the time </v>

261
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:44.623
<v Speaker 1>grade eight or grade nine comes around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pushing on the teacher is a lot </v>

262
00:13:47.841 --> 00:13:48.674
<v Speaker 1>harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can see how play shades into </v>

263
00:13:50.691 --> 00:13:54.740
<v Speaker 1>dominance dispute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it is a separate circuit exploration</v>

264
00:13:54.741 --> 00:13:55.574
<v Speaker 1>that's a separate circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that we'll talk </v>

265
00:13:58.911 --> 00:13:59.744
<v Speaker 1>about today is Swanson's elaboration of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that half of the hypothalamus </v>

266
00:14:03.921 --> 00:14:06.080
<v Speaker 1>is fundamentally devoted towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration,</v>

267
00:14:06.081 --> 00:14:08.450
<v Speaker 1>which is quite cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means exploration is a really,</v>

268
00:14:08.451 --> 00:14:09.284
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really old system and it's sort of like </v>

269
00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:16.070
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't got anything else to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>so you don't want to play,</v>

270
00:14:16.071 --> 00:14:17.630
<v Speaker 1>you're not hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not thirsty,</v>

271
00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:21.380
<v Speaker 1>you're not angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not too warm or too cold,</v>

272
00:14:21.381 --> 00:14:22.370
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

273
00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:25.820
<v Speaker 1>Your default isn't sort of quiescent </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep,</v>

274
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:27.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't just</v>

275
00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:32.320
<v Speaker 1>run out of batteries and lie on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>floor unless you're of course,</v>

276
00:14:32.321 --> 00:14:33.820
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're very tired.</v>

277
00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:35.043
<v Speaker 1>What will generally happen is if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other fundamental motivational states </v>

278
00:14:38.051 --> 00:14:38.884
<v Speaker 1>have been satiated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'll engage in exploration and </v>

279
00:14:42.461 --> 00:14:44.710
<v Speaker 1>some different people at different </v>
<v Speaker 1>rates.</v>

280
00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:46.023
<v Speaker 1>If you're an extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll engage in exploration in the </v>

281
00:14:48.401 --> 00:14:49.234
<v Speaker 1>social environment and if you're open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then engage in exploration at a more </v>

282
00:14:53.091 --> 00:14:53.924
<v Speaker 1>cognitive level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be with regards to </v>

283
00:14:55.281 --> 00:14:56.114
<v Speaker 1>artistic creativity or to fiction or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the expression of some sort of </v>

284
00:14:59.601 --> 00:15:03.830
<v Speaker 1>intellectual or philosophical pursuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that you're wired up that</v>

285
00:15:03.831 --> 00:15:06.890
<v Speaker 1>way is because if you have a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>extra energy,</v>

286
00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:07.813
<v Speaker 1>you might as well use that to map out </v>
<v Speaker 1>more of the environment so that when </v>

287
00:15:12.621 --> 00:15:13.454
<v Speaker 1>push comes to shove,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere down the road you'll be in </v>

288
00:15:16.491 --> 00:15:21.491
<v Speaker 1>possession of more information and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>flexible and more knowledgeable in your,</v>

289
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:22.723
<v Speaker 1>in your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your conceptual and perceptual </v>

290
00:15:24.621 --> 00:15:26.270
<v Speaker 1>structures and also in your actions.</v>

291
00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:30.130
<v Speaker 1>So people have a pretty strong tendency </v>
<v Speaker 1>to default to exploration,</v>

292
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:32.440
<v Speaker 1>but there's variability in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

293
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:37.610
<v Speaker 1>you can also sort of divide up these </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations as ingestive or defensive.</v>

294
00:15:37.611 --> 00:15:38.444
<v Speaker 1>That's not a bad way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's reproductive </v>

295
00:15:40.641 --> 00:15:45.641
<v Speaker 1>motivations as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's unlikely to be a full map.</v>

296
00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.150
<v Speaker 1>It kind of depends on where you put the </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions because we know,</v>

297
00:15:50.151 --> 00:15:50.984
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a separate discussed </v>

298
00:15:52.671 --> 00:15:57.110
<v Speaker 1>circuit and that doesn't seem to load </v>
<v Speaker 1>with anxiety or with pain.</v>

299
00:15:57.111 --> 00:15:57.531
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

300
00:15:57.531 --> 00:15:58.364
<v Speaker 1>it's its own biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>system and it seems to be associated </v>

301
00:16:03.111 --> 00:16:03.944
<v Speaker 1>with trait conscientiousness maybe and </v>
<v Speaker 1>also with political conservatism in </v>

302
00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:09.134
<v Speaker 1>orderliness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those things are all quite </v>

303
00:16:10.191 --> 00:16:12.740
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all kind of clumped together and,</v>

304
00:16:12.741 --> 00:16:15.080
<v Speaker 1>but whether that's an emotion or </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations,</v>

305
00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.900
<v Speaker 1>not exactly clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

306
00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:19.963
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk about it a little bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's the hypothalamus and as you </v>

307
00:16:22.911 --> 00:16:24.480
<v Speaker 1>can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

308
00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:26.450
<v Speaker 1>it's not one thing.</v>

309
00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:27.523
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing at the macro level in the brain </v>

310
00:16:29.721 --> 00:16:30.554
<v Speaker 1>is one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it's this layered thing just </v>

311
00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:34.034
<v Speaker 1>like everything else in the world except</v>
<v Speaker 1>even more so because the brain is so </v>

312
00:16:36.471 --> 00:16:37.304
<v Speaker 1>incredibly complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can see by looking at that </v>

313
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.540
<v Speaker 1>there's all those little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the things that are colored.</v>

314
00:16:41.541 --> 00:16:45.140
<v Speaker 1>They're basically hypothalamic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

315
00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.980
<v Speaker 1>modules I guess would be a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of putting it.</v>

316
00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:52.700
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell they're even an </v>
<v Speaker 1>anatomically distinct,</v>

317
00:16:52.701 --> 00:16:55.580
<v Speaker 1>so obviously they're not doing exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing.</v>

318
00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:00.050
<v Speaker 1>So you might think of brain anatomy as </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a fixed,</v>

319
00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.770
<v Speaker 1>what would you call something that we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>already managed quite well.</v>

320
00:17:03.771 --> 00:17:04.604
<v Speaker 1>And we have all the categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Systems down in the structure of the </v>

321
00:17:06.351 --> 00:17:09.290
<v Speaker 1>brain is quite well known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really not true at all.</v>

322
00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:10.393
<v Speaker 1>Like the brain is truly terra incognita </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it isn't even like our naming a </v>

323
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:15.343
<v Speaker 1>rituals let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or conventions are not necessarily </v>

324
00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:22.010
<v Speaker 1>appropriate for one to one mapping of </v>
<v Speaker 1>say structure onto function.</v>

325
00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:23.290
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

326
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:25.303
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

327
00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.143
<v Speaker 1>they're sort of anatomical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're markers for anatomical </v>

328
00:17:28.221 --> 00:17:31.220
<v Speaker 1>convenience in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

329
00:17:31.221 --> 00:17:33.770
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's a way of thinking about it.</v>

330
00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:37.680
<v Speaker 1>So you have your frame which specifies </v>
<v Speaker 1>your lack.</v>

331
00:17:37.681 --> 00:17:40.760
<v Speaker 1>Say I'm hungry and then a goal pops up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

332
00:17:40.761 --> 00:17:41.594
<v Speaker 1>well I should have something to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the hypothalamus is modulating </v>

333
00:17:44.841 --> 00:17:45.674
<v Speaker 1>perceptual and cognitive circuits so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you think that and so that you </v>

334
00:17:48.501 --> 00:17:49.334
<v Speaker 1>start to up the world into a place where</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hungry person like you could become </v>

335
00:17:54.391 --> 00:17:59.391
<v Speaker 1>satisfied and then the behaviors kick in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are relevant to that,</v>

336
00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:01.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuit.</v>

337
00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:06.860
<v Speaker 1>And so you can think of yourself as </v>
<v Speaker 1>popping through these sorts of frames on</v>

338
00:18:07.681 --> 00:18:09.990
<v Speaker 1>a fairly sick like basis throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

339
00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:11.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously you get hungry,</v>

340
00:18:11.851 --> 00:18:13.470
<v Speaker 1>you get thirsty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get tired.</v>

341
00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:14.573
<v Speaker 1>And so your consciousness is being </v>
<v Speaker 1>modulated by subcortical circuitry that </v>

342
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:24.030
<v Speaker 1>is basically charged with your self </v>
<v Speaker 1>preservation.</v>

343
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.430
<v Speaker 1>And in some ways you come along for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ride.</v>

344
00:18:26.431 --> 00:18:31.431
<v Speaker 1>I mean your consciousness is mostly </v>
<v Speaker 1>there in some sense to detect deviations</v>

345
00:18:31.441 --> 00:18:35.220
<v Speaker 1>from not so much expectation but from </v>
<v Speaker 1>desire,</v>

346
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:36.083
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you lay out one of these little </v>

347
00:18:36.661 --> 00:18:37.494
<v Speaker 1>maps on the world and then you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to happen and what your </v>

348
00:18:40.621 --> 00:18:41.454
<v Speaker 1>consciousness does more or less is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>monitor and if something that you don't </v>

349
00:18:47.311 --> 00:18:51.930
<v Speaker 1>want to happen happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then consciousness will take a look.</v>

350
00:18:51.931 --> 00:18:52.764
<v Speaker 1>In some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember that hierarchy of goals </v>

351
00:18:55.411 --> 00:18:56.780
<v Speaker 1>that I showed you from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

352
00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:57.653
<v Speaker 1>motor output up to high order goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your consciousness kind of moves up and </v>

353
00:19:00.991 --> 00:19:04.350
<v Speaker 1>down that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've made an error trying to figure</v>

354
00:19:04.351 --> 00:19:08.490
<v Speaker 1>out at which level of abstraction that </v>
<v Speaker 1>error should be rectified,</v>

355
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.620
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of what you do when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

356
00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:11.813
<v Speaker 1>and so that process is going to kick in </v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever you're moving towards your </v>

357
00:19:15.781 --> 00:19:19.140
<v Speaker 1>desired end and something that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to have happen happens,</v>

358
00:19:19.141 --> 00:19:19.974
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you usually stop that sort of an Eng </v>

359
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:22.463
<v Speaker 1>anxiety response?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stopping and then if nothing else </v>

360
00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:27.840
<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's too bad.</v>

361
00:19:27.841 --> 00:19:30.120
<v Speaker 1>Well then you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll start to explore it in,</v>

362
00:19:30.121 --> 00:19:30.954
<v Speaker 1>animals often do that by moving around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people will do that just as with </v>

363
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:36.023
<v Speaker 1>with equal facility just by running </v>
<v Speaker 1>simulations in their mind and trying to </v>

364
00:19:39.631 --> 00:19:41.220
<v Speaker 1>calculate what went wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

365
00:19:41.221 --> 00:19:43.980
<v Speaker 1>To try to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a form of exploratory behavior as</v>

366
00:19:43.981 --> 00:19:47.760
<v Speaker 1>well that would be more associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>trait openness and with intelligence.</v>

367
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.313
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

368
00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:53.863
<v Speaker 1>so there's how m Swanson divides up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus see the a little pink </v>

369
00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:04.070
<v Speaker 1>things there on the left are part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>defensive circuits.</v>

370
00:20:04.071 --> 00:20:07.730
<v Speaker 1>And then the red things on the laughter </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the reproductive circuits.</v>

371
00:20:07.731 --> 00:20:10.400
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously those,</v>

372
00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:15.760
<v Speaker 1>the fact that those circuits exist lays </v>
<v Speaker 1>onto Darwinian theory quite nicely.</v>

373
00:20:15.861 --> 00:20:16.694
<v Speaker 1>The defensive circuits obviously protect</v>
<v Speaker 1>you from dying and the reproductive </v>

374
00:20:19.311 --> 00:20:20.660
<v Speaker 1>circuits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

375
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.250
<v Speaker 1>facilitate your reproduction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not much of a</v>

376
00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:27.690
<v Speaker 1>fairly obvious conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

377
00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.360
<v Speaker 1>And so those are all located in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this,</v>

378
00:20:32.361 --> 00:20:34.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essential part of the brain,</v>

379
00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:35.293
<v Speaker 1>the hypothalamic hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this is something little that's a </v>

380
00:20:40.161 --> 00:20:40.994
<v Speaker 1>little more complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll go through it a little bit more </v>

381
00:20:42.471 --> 00:20:43.930
<v Speaker 1>carefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look on the right,</v>

382
00:20:43.931 --> 00:20:44.764
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where Swanson perfectly onto </v>

383
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:54.630
<v Speaker 1>piaget and I put this once in paper in </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a optional reading,</v>

384
00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:57.940
<v Speaker 1>but if you're interested in the sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that we're covering this class,</v>

385
00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.013
<v Speaker 1>that's a great paper to hack your way </v>
<v Speaker 1>through even though it's very hard </v>

386
00:21:01.991 --> 00:21:06.991
<v Speaker 1>because you learn a lot about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying biology of some of these more</v>

387
00:21:07.961 --> 00:21:11.530
<v Speaker 1>complex clinical and developmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories that we've covered.</v>

388
00:21:11.531 --> 00:21:16.531
<v Speaker 1>So basically what Swanson is pointing </v>
<v Speaker 1>out is that at the lowest level,</v>

389
00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:21.100
<v Speaker 1>at the highest resolution level of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>central nervous system,</v>

390
00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:22.413
<v Speaker 1>your your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have motor output circuits that are </v>

391
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:27.963
<v Speaker 1>enabling you to move and those are </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating in large part with your </v>

392
00:21:31.151 --> 00:21:33.990
<v Speaker 1>spine but also with lower parts of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brainstem.</v>

393
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:34.893
<v Speaker 1>So those are fundamental movements of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sorts that piaget would call </v>

394
00:21:37.541 --> 00:21:38.374
<v Speaker 1>reflexive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the locomotor pattern </v>

395
00:21:41.261 --> 00:21:43.750
<v Speaker 1>generator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the best way to think about this</v>

396
00:21:43.751 --> 00:21:44.584
<v Speaker 1>from an analogical perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and actually Alexander Luria used this </v>

397
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:52.030
<v Speaker 1>analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he called behavioral patterns,</v>

398
00:21:52.031 --> 00:21:55.010
<v Speaker 1>kinetic melodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a lovely phrase say,</v>

399
00:21:55.011 --> 00:21:55.844
<v Speaker 1>because you know how obviously a song is</v>
<v Speaker 1>made out of notes and then the notes </v>

400
00:21:58.331 --> 00:22:01.840
<v Speaker 1>combined into phrases and the phrases </v>
<v Speaker 1>combined Santa's passages.</v>

401
00:22:01.841 --> 00:22:02.674
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well even more interestingly then if </v>

402
00:22:04.631 --> 00:22:05.464
<v Speaker 1>it's an orchestral piece of music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple instruments are playing at the </v>

403
00:22:08.081 --> 00:22:08.914
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it sort of extends right into the </v>

404
00:22:10.341 --> 00:22:12.000
<v Speaker 1>social domain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But your,</v>

405
00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:12.863
<v Speaker 1>your actions are sort of like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're made out of micro routines and </v>

406
00:22:15.101 --> 00:22:15.934
<v Speaker 1>then those are chained together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>those are chained together in higher </v>

407
00:22:18.611 --> 00:22:23.170
<v Speaker 1>order abstractions and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way up to the cortex.</v>

408
00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:28.290
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swanson points out that the,</v>

409
00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:33.040
<v Speaker 1>the motor system has three sets of </v>
<v Speaker 1>inputs.</v>

410
00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:37.000
<v Speaker 1>So the cognitive system that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>weigh up,</v>

411
00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:39.880
<v Speaker 1>that's our level of abstraction that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>way up in the brain.</v>

412
00:22:39.881 --> 00:22:42.090
<v Speaker 1>So the cognitive system is where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

413
00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.650
<v Speaker 1>you might do a voluntary action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you look at something and say,</v>

414
00:22:44.651 --> 00:22:46.480
<v Speaker 1>well I'm going to pick up this piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>paper.</v>

415
00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:47.733
<v Speaker 1>And so that's talked down cortical </v>
<v Speaker 1>control and then the state system input </v>

416
00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:56.170
<v Speaker 1>to the motor system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The state system is your body monitoring</v>

417
00:22:56.410 --> 00:23:01.300
<v Speaker 1>what's going on inside of itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the autonomic nervous system is part</v>

418
00:23:01.301 --> 00:23:05.290
<v Speaker 1>of the motor output system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the state monitoring system takes</v>

419
00:23:05.291 --> 00:23:08.110
<v Speaker 1>a careful look and the hypothalamus does</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fair bit of this,</v>

420
00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:09.093
<v Speaker 1>takes a careful look at what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside you and then activates different </v>

421
00:23:12.011 --> 00:23:12.844
<v Speaker 1>parts of your digestive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know that the gut system </v>

422
00:23:15.791 --> 00:23:18.550
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have no conscious control over.</v>

423
00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.090
<v Speaker 1>And then obviously their sensory system </v>
<v Speaker 1>inputs too.</v>

424
00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:23.323
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so those are the three main inputs into </v>

425
00:23:25.541 --> 00:23:26.374
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the motor system and that acts on </v>

426
00:23:28.151 --> 00:23:28.984
<v Speaker 1>the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the motor system has this </v>

427
00:23:30.791 --> 00:23:34.900
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical nature that's built from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the spine upwards.</v>

428
00:23:34.901 --> 00:23:35.734
<v Speaker 1>And so you can think of like the brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a collection of ever expanding </v>

429
00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:41.733
<v Speaker 1>control systems that allow you to what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Learn and undertake evermore complex </v>

430
00:23:48.441 --> 00:23:50.020
<v Speaker 1>motor schemes of action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

431
00:23:50.021 --> 00:23:50.854
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that people think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about human beings is that we're very </v>

432
00:23:53.661 --> 00:23:55.250
<v Speaker 1>good at thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

433
00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.113
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not just good at thinking like </v>

434
00:23:57.261 --> 00:23:58.910
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're crazy,</v>

435
00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:02.420
<v Speaker 1>crazily adaptable in terms of our motor </v>
<v Speaker 1>output.</v>

436
00:24:02.421 --> 00:24:05.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you watch the watch the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Olympics,</v>

437
00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:06.373
<v Speaker 1>you know when you see human beings can </v>
<v Speaker 1>do things that no other animal could </v>

438
00:24:09.951 --> 00:24:10.784
<v Speaker 1>even think of doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're completely crazy when it </v>

439
00:24:12.861 --> 00:24:14.990
<v Speaker 1>comes to the sorts of things we can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with our body.</v>

440
00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.600
<v Speaker 1>Like we're good on ice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're good in the water,</v>

441
00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:20.240
<v Speaker 1>we can ski.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are really good at jumping,</v>

442
00:24:20.241 --> 00:24:21.074
<v Speaker 1>they can climb across buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I people who train themselves can climb </v>

443
00:24:23.991 --> 00:24:24.824
<v Speaker 1>like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean human beings are unbelievably </v>

444
00:24:27.021 --> 00:24:27.854
<v Speaker 1>variable in terms of their motor output.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another part of our </v>

445
00:24:29.841 --> 00:24:30.674
<v Speaker 1>intelligence that's not just abstract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in part that's because we have </v>

446
00:24:34.731 --> 00:24:35.564
<v Speaker 1>this very well developed cortical area </v>
<v Speaker 1>that enables us to chain ever more </v>

447
00:24:39.741 --> 00:24:44.741
<v Speaker 1>complex patterns of behavior together </v>
<v Speaker 1>and also to develop patterns of behavior</v>

448
00:24:44.751 --> 00:24:48.260
<v Speaker 1>that are sort of outside instinctual </v>
<v Speaker 1>specification.</v>

449
00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:52.490
<v Speaker 1>So you imagine with an animal that has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>less complex brain,</v>

450
00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.273
<v Speaker 1>a lot of its behavior is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>limited to those cause a instinctual </v>

451
00:24:57.681 --> 00:24:58.514
<v Speaker 1>patterns of behavior that are devoted </v>
<v Speaker 1>directly towards the solution of basic </v>

452
00:25:02.511 --> 00:25:05.030
<v Speaker 1>biological problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

453
00:25:05.031 --> 00:25:07.280
<v Speaker 1>we can kind of solve those without too </v>
<v Speaker 1>much effort.</v>

454
00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.113
<v Speaker 1>And then we have all this spare motor </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity leftover and people do the </v>

455
00:25:10.281 --> 00:25:12.260
<v Speaker 1>weirdest things with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

456
00:25:12.261 --> 00:25:14.930
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and really remarkable.</v>

457
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely remarkable things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

458
00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:20.750
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're pretty cool that way.</v>

459
00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.120
<v Speaker 1>We don't get enough credit for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

460
00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:26.060
<v Speaker 1>because human beings think about human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being as an animal,</v>

461
00:25:26.061 --> 00:25:26.511
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

462
00:25:26.511 --> 00:25:27.344
<v Speaker 1>people are kind of loath to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are definitely the most interesting </v>

463
00:25:29.961 --> 00:25:30.950
<v Speaker 1>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

464
00:25:30.951 --> 00:25:35.780
<v Speaker 1>if you saw like a what a pygmy </v>
<v Speaker 1>hippopotamus skateboarding,</v>

465
00:25:35.781 --> 00:25:37.700
<v Speaker 1>you'd think that was pretty remarkable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

466
00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:38.773
<v Speaker 1>but people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do those sorts of things all the </v>

467
00:25:39.981 --> 00:25:41.540
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

468
00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:46.490
<v Speaker 1>we just take it as a matter of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>the lowest of motor neurone pools,</v>

469
00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.290
<v Speaker 1>the lowest level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the locomotor system,</v>

470
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:53.590
<v Speaker 1>it's locomotion and an action is foreign</v>
<v Speaker 1>by a subset of motoneuron tools.</v>

471
00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:59.900
<v Speaker 1>That's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Motor neurons in the spinal cord,</v>

472
00:25:59.901 --> 00:26:00.734
<v Speaker 1>ventral horn that innovates the limb </v>
<v Speaker 1>muscles responsible for locomotor </v>

473
00:26:03.771 --> 00:26:04.604
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

474
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:08.890
<v Speaker 1>I dictated this with dragon dictate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>now and then it does weird things.</v>

475
00:26:08.891 --> 00:26:09.830
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so tools,</v>

476
00:26:09.831 --> 00:26:10.664
<v Speaker 1>God only knows where that came from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a set of motor neurons in the spinal </v>

477
00:26:15.651 --> 00:26:16.670
<v Speaker 1>cord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ventral horn.</v>

478
00:26:16.671 --> 00:26:17.504
<v Speaker 1>So it's way down in the spine that </v>
<v Speaker 1>innovate the llamas limb muscles </v>

479
00:26:20.061 --> 00:26:20.894
<v Speaker 1>responsible for locomotor behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you start to think about the brain </v>

480
00:26:23.481 --> 00:26:27.200
<v Speaker 1>as something that moves your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot easier to conceptualize.</v>

481
00:26:27.201 --> 00:26:29.480
<v Speaker 1>The brain is something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>distributed through the body,</v>

482
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:32.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your spine is actually quite smart.</v>

483
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:35.120
<v Speaker 1>So even though in some sense you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>think with it,</v>

484
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:39.650
<v Speaker 1>it's capable of very complex sensory </v>
<v Speaker 1>detection and also motor mapping.</v>

485
00:26:39.651 --> 00:26:41.300
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

486
00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:42.793
<v Speaker 1>mostly are relatively automated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively reflective one level up the </v>

487
00:26:47.701 --> 00:26:51.300
<v Speaker 1>existence of a spinal locomotor pattern </v>
<v Speaker 1>generator.</v>

488
00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:52.253
<v Speaker 1>So this shows that the spine isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible just for the most basic of </v>

489
00:26:55.411 --> 00:26:56.960
<v Speaker 1>motor outputs or sensory inputs.</v>

490
00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:57.803
<v Speaker 1>It can actually generate patterns is </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrated by the fact that whereas a </v>

491
00:27:01.021 --> 00:27:05.580
<v Speaker 1>spinal animal displays no spontaneous </v>
<v Speaker 1>locomotor activity.</v>

492
00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:10.700
<v Speaker 1>So if you sever an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nervous system.</v>

493
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.680
<v Speaker 1>So it only has the spine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll just lay there,</v>

494
00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd think it's paralyzed.</v>

495
00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:19.650
<v Speaker 1>That's what you would think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But coordinated limb movements,</v>

496
00:27:19.651 --> 00:27:20.484
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of locomotion may be </v>
<v Speaker 1>elicited when the limbs of such an </v>

497
00:27:23.701 --> 00:27:24.534
<v Speaker 1>animal are placed on a moving treadmill </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's providing sematic sensory input </v>

498
00:27:27.901 --> 00:27:30.930
<v Speaker 1>to the pattern generator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they've done this with people who</v>

499
00:27:30.931 --> 00:27:33.780
<v Speaker 1>are paraplegic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you take someone who's paraplegic and</v>

500
00:27:33.781 --> 00:27:34.614
<v Speaker 1>so they can't obviously walk and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>hoist them up and you put them on a </v>

501
00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:39.983
<v Speaker 1>treadmill and you lean them forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their legs will walk and that spinal </v>

502
00:27:43.411 --> 00:27:44.244
<v Speaker 1>controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what you're doing with your </v>

503
00:27:46.411 --> 00:27:47.244
<v Speaker 1>spine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

504
00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:50.190
<v Speaker 1>because you're not thinking when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>walk you're or you're not thinking about</v>

505
00:27:50.191 --> 00:27:51.024
<v Speaker 1>walking unless you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're one of those people who </v>

506
00:27:54.061 --> 00:27:56.010
<v Speaker 1>can't chew gum and walk at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

507
00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:57.293
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it just shows you how complex you </v>

508
00:28:00.571 --> 00:28:01.560
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even at the,</v>

509
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of the base levels of your,</v>

510
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:07.500
<v Speaker 1>of your intelligence hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>level up,</v>

511
00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:11.670
<v Speaker 1>locomotor pattern controller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's controlling the</v>

512
00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:17.340
<v Speaker 1>locomotor pattern generator</v>
<v Speaker 1>in contrast,</v>

513
00:28:17.341 --> 00:28:20.310
<v Speaker 1>undisturbed chronic hypothalamic </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

514
00:28:20.311 --> 00:28:21.144
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now one of the ways people figured </v>

515
00:28:22.621 --> 00:28:24.960
<v Speaker 1>out how the brain works was by </v>
<v Speaker 1>sectioning animals,</v>

516
00:28:24.961 --> 00:28:28.500
<v Speaker 1>nervous systems when they're alive at </v>
<v Speaker 1>different levels of complexity.</v>

517
00:28:28.501 --> 00:28:31.200
<v Speaker 1>So a spinal animal is one that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically paralyzed.</v>

518
00:28:31.201 --> 00:28:33.480
<v Speaker 1>It's brain is separated from it spinal </v>
<v Speaker 1>cord,</v>

519
00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.553
<v Speaker 1>but then you can separate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus with the intact spinal </v>

520
00:28:37.561 --> 00:28:38.394
<v Speaker 1>cord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's one unit from the cortex and </v>

521
00:28:40.441 --> 00:28:43.890
<v Speaker 1>even from the memory systems and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>from most of the emotion systems.</v>

522
00:28:43.891 --> 00:28:47.190
<v Speaker 1>And so the animal in some sense hardly </v>
<v Speaker 1>has a brain at all.</v>

523
00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the hypothalamus is,</v>

524
00:28:48.931 --> 00:28:49.764
<v Speaker 1>you saw it's a little tiny thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that's on top of that can be </v>

525
00:28:52.441 --> 00:28:57.441
<v Speaker 1>separated from it and the animal can </v>
<v Speaker 1>still act spontaneously.</v>

526
00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.620
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's an example.</v>

527
00:29:01.621 --> 00:29:06.621
<v Speaker 1>If this has been done with cats and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a female cat and it's in a cage</v>

528
00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:08.453
<v Speaker 1>and it's only a hypothalamic animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can basically manage like it can't </v>

529
00:29:11.941 --> 00:29:16.350
<v Speaker 1>learn new things very well and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can't remember anything.</v>

530
00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't have episodic memory and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

531
00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.710
<v Speaker 1>but it can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can maintain its temperature,</v>

532
00:29:22.711 --> 00:29:25.620
<v Speaker 1>it can eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can engage in sexual activity.</v>

533
00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:29.410
<v Speaker 1>It's got defensive aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like most of the animal in some sense is</v>

534
00:29:29.411 --> 00:29:32.910
<v Speaker 1>still there from an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from an input output perspective.</v>

535
00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:35.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also hyper exploratory,</v>

536
00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:37.740
<v Speaker 1>which is quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

537
00:29:37.741 --> 00:29:38.670
<v Speaker 1>because you wouldn't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

538
00:29:38.671 --> 00:29:42.550
<v Speaker 1>animal with no brain is the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploratory kind of animal.</v>

539
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:44.133
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happens to be the case as long as it </v>

540
00:29:45.281 --> 00:29:46.114
<v Speaker 1>has a hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that shows you a how old exploration </v>

541
00:29:49.151 --> 00:29:49.984
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also kind of gives you some clue </v>

542
00:29:50.811 --> 00:29:52.450
<v Speaker 1>about what the rest of the brain is </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

543
00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:55.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

544
00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.193
<v Speaker 1>you explore new things we'll say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is you have to be </v>

545
00:29:59.441 --> 00:30:01.660
<v Speaker 1>able to tell the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's new and what isn't.</v>

546
00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:02.883
<v Speaker 1>And so what you need to tell the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between what's new and what </v>

547
00:30:05.501 --> 00:30:06.334
<v Speaker 1>isn't is memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of what the higher order </v>

548
00:30:09.341 --> 00:30:10.174
<v Speaker 1>parts of the brain you're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically keeping track of where you've </v>

549
00:30:12.761 --> 00:30:13.594
<v Speaker 1>been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you've been somewhere before </v>

550
00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:20.200
<v Speaker 1>then the exploratory circuit is </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically shut off as long as everything</v>

551
00:30:20.201 --> 00:30:21.034
<v Speaker 1>that you're doing there is working and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you need the whole brain basically to </v>

552
00:30:24.641 --> 00:30:28.180
<v Speaker 1>shut off the hypothalamus in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how the thing works.</v>

553
00:30:28.181 --> 00:30:31.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're kind of a default on </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

554
00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:32.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

555
00:30:32.411 --> 00:30:34.660
<v Speaker 1>your motor systems are ready to go and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of,</v>

556
00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.390
<v Speaker 1>you're alive and you're ready to go like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wild animal.</v>

557
00:30:37.391 --> 00:30:39.490
<v Speaker 1>But the cortex dampens that down.</v>

558
00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:40.563
<v Speaker 1>And it does that by only allowing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>activities that are relevant to that </v>

559
00:30:44.321 --> 00:30:47.950
<v Speaker 1>area that might be none of them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>function at any one time.</v>

560
00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:51.850
<v Speaker 1>So you take off the cortex while the </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal can still do a lot of things,</v>

561
00:30:51.851 --> 00:30:52.684
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its ability to match its behavior to </v>

562
00:30:54.881 --> 00:30:57.610
<v Speaker 1>novel situations and to learn new </v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors is very,</v>

563
00:30:57.611 --> 00:30:58.600
<v Speaker 1>very limited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

564
00:30:58.810 --> 00:30:59.643
<v Speaker 1>it becomes hyper exploratory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can't remember anything and it </v>

565
00:31:03.221 --> 00:31:06.220
<v Speaker 1>becomes very limited in the flexibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>of its behavior.</v>

566
00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:11.490
<v Speaker 1>And so as you move farther up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy of complexity,</v>

567
00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:16.360
<v Speaker 1>then you're able to do more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>novel and more and more complex and more</v>

568
00:31:16.361 --> 00:31:17.194
<v Speaker 1>and more situation specific things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the sense of providing a certain </v>

569
00:31:23.441 --> 00:31:27.200
<v Speaker 1>level of endogenous activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means self-generated activity.</v>

570
00:31:27.201 --> 00:31:31.900
<v Speaker 1>So the hypothalamic thalamic animal will</v>
<v Speaker 1>move by itself without being stimulated.</v>

571
00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:33.333
<v Speaker 1>The hypothalamic locomotor region can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought of as a locomotor pattern </v>

572
00:31:36.701 --> 00:31:37.534
<v Speaker 1>controller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which generates spontaneous inputs </v>

573
00:31:39.461 --> 00:31:42.550
<v Speaker 1>ultimately to the spinal locomotor </v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern generator.</v>

574
00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:43.900
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's hierarchy.</v>

575
00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:45.653
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I already talked about behavioral state </v>

576
00:31:46.901 --> 00:31:47.734
<v Speaker 1>inputs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another picture of the nervous </v>

577
00:31:48.941 --> 00:31:50.890
<v Speaker 1>system just to remind you of how it </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks,</v>

578
00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:54.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>counts distributed through the body.</v>

579
00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:56.373
<v Speaker 1>Oh this is very interesting too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't learn this until I read this </v>

580
00:32:00.011 --> 00:32:01.990
<v Speaker 1>paper by Swanson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

581
00:32:01.991 --> 00:32:03.910
<v Speaker 1>that's so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could I have not learned that?</v>

582
00:32:03.911 --> 00:32:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Like 30 years ago Swanson said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

583
00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:09.170
<v Speaker 1>let's go back one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did I?</v>

584
00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:10.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ray Moncayo.</v>

585
00:32:10.851 --> 00:32:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Kal was like the world's greatest </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroanatomist.</v>

586
00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:15.970
<v Speaker 1>He was the guy who really established </v>
<v Speaker 1>the field,</v>

587
00:32:15.971 --> 00:32:19.300
<v Speaker 1>so did a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigation into the fine structure of</v>

588
00:32:19.301 --> 00:32:23.050
<v Speaker 1>the brain like 110 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a long time ago.</v>

589
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:24.663
<v Speaker 1>And he pointed out that sensory systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a dual projection within the </v>

590
00:32:28.031 --> 00:32:28.864
<v Speaker 1>central nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you guys about blind sight </v>

591
00:32:30.641 --> 00:32:31.331
<v Speaker 1>already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

592
00:32:31.331 --> 00:32:35.470
<v Speaker 1>and I in fact that your eyes map onto </v>
<v Speaker 1>different levels of the hierarchy,</v>

593
00:32:35.471 --> 00:32:37.420
<v Speaker 1>say of sensory input and motor control.</v>

594
00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:38.493
<v Speaker 1>Kal basically outlined the for that one </v>
<v Speaker 1>branch goes directly to the motor </v>

595
00:32:42.141 --> 00:32:43.730
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

596
00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:44.743
<v Speaker 1>that's for I to output mapping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's fast cause there's not a lot </v>

597
00:32:47.901 --> 00:32:48.734
<v Speaker 1>of thinking in between.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might think that's bad because </v>

598
00:32:51.651 --> 00:32:54.230
<v Speaker 1>you want to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's good because sometimes you know</v>

599
00:32:54.231 --> 00:32:55.064
<v Speaker 1>what to do and you don't want to thank </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just want to execute it as fast as </v>

600
00:32:57.141 --> 00:32:59.690
<v Speaker 1>you possibly can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these lower orders,</v>

601
00:32:59.691 --> 00:33:01.700
<v Speaker 1>simpler inputs are good for that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

602
00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:05.720
<v Speaker 1>One goes directly to the motor system </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other goes more or less directly</v>

603
00:33:05.721 --> 00:33:06.554
<v Speaker 1>to the cerebral cortex where sensations </v>
<v Speaker 1>and perceptions are elaborated and </v>

604
00:33:09.771 --> 00:33:14.720
<v Speaker 1>voluntary motor impulses are generated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this sort of explains for a long time</v>

605
00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:16.213
<v Speaker 1>experimental psychology was dominated by</v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviorists who thought of the animal </v>

606
00:33:19.191 --> 00:33:20.024
<v Speaker 1>as a stimulus response machine and never</v>
<v Speaker 1>paid much attention to the function of </v>

607
00:33:24.141 --> 00:33:28.310
<v Speaker 1>things like thought or emotion or </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex internal states.</v>

608
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:31.340
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the behaviors got an awful long way with</v>

609
00:33:31.341 --> 00:33:35.690
<v Speaker 1>their idea of the animal as a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple stimulus response machine.</v>

610
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:38.720
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy that we're describing.</v>

611
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:39.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you,</v>

612
00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:44.570
<v Speaker 1>you can treat an animal as if it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty simple machine because it has all</v>

613
00:33:44.571 --> 00:33:45.404
<v Speaker 1>that simple machinery in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that on top of that simple </v>

614
00:33:48.801 --> 00:33:51.110
<v Speaker 1>machinery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot more complex machinery.</v>

615
00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.840
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the simple machinery does a lot more</v>

616
00:33:53.841 --> 00:33:56.600
<v Speaker 1>than people generally think and can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than people think.</v>

617
00:33:57.050 --> 00:34:01.520
<v Speaker 1>And so the fact that there are these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least two projections,</v>

618
00:34:01.521 --> 00:34:02.354
<v Speaker 1>they branch more than that gives you </v>
<v Speaker 1>right away a sense of why the behaviors </v>

619
00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:09.170
<v Speaker 1>could have been right and the cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists could have been right.</v>

620
00:34:09.171 --> 00:34:10.004
<v Speaker 1>And even the cycle dynamic thinkers can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be right because they're analyzing the </v>

621
00:34:13.371 --> 00:34:14.204
<v Speaker 1>system at different levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical complexity and extracting </v>

622
00:34:17.241 --> 00:34:19.570
<v Speaker 1>out slightly different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

623
00:34:19.910 --> 00:34:22.280
<v Speaker 1>what would you call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

624
00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:23.293
<v Speaker 1>observations and some of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even like the simpler systems can </v>

625
00:34:27.621 --> 00:34:28.970
<v Speaker 1>have quite complex output.</v>

626
00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:29.803
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things that the simpler </v>

627
00:34:31.461 --> 00:34:32.294
<v Speaker 1>sensory motor system does is it detects </v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes because primates don't like </v>

628
00:34:35.511 --> 00:34:36.440
<v Speaker 1>snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

629
00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:37.483
<v Speaker 1>there's a woman named</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lynn is bell wrote a nice book on </v>

630
00:34:42.021 --> 00:34:42.854
<v Speaker 1>primate vision and snakes and she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>very curious about why human beings </v>

631
00:34:45.591 --> 00:34:46.710
<v Speaker 1>could see so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

632
00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:49.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she also noticed that we're very good at</v>

633
00:34:49.521 --> 00:34:51.020
<v Speaker 1>detecting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

634
00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:54.740
<v Speaker 1>the sort of camouflage patterns that </v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes used,</v>

635
00:34:54.741 --> 00:34:56.840
<v Speaker 1>especially in the lower half of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>visual field.</v>

636
00:34:56.841 --> 00:34:57.674
<v Speaker 1>And she did this cross cultural survey </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the world and found out that </v>

637
00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:05.510
<v Speaker 1>where there's more predatory snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the primates have better vision.</v>

638
00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:06.643
<v Speaker 1>So we sorta coevolved with snakes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes gave us vision just like it says </v>

639
00:35:09.981 --> 00:35:12.620
<v Speaker 1>in Genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty damn funny as far as I'm</v>

640
00:35:12.621 --> 00:35:15.020
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was snakes in trees even so,</v>

641
00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:17.450
<v Speaker 1>and fruit of course gave us color </v>
<v Speaker 1>vision.</v>

642
00:35:17.451 --> 00:35:20.330
<v Speaker 1>So the whole genesis story nailed it </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty well.</v>

643
00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:21.523
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes have been around long enough and </v>

644
00:35:23.751 --> 00:35:26.330
<v Speaker 1>have been our enemy or say predatory </v>
<v Speaker 1>reptiles,</v>

645
00:35:26.331 --> 00:35:26.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

646
00:35:26.831 --> 00:35:29.900
<v Speaker 1>if you don't really want to go with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>little snake thing that are,</v>

647
00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.040
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've evolved,</v>

648
00:35:31.041 --> 00:35:33.410
<v Speaker 1>we've coevolved with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like 60 million years.</v>

649
00:35:33.411 --> 00:35:35.060
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very long period of time.</v>

650
00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:39.930
<v Speaker 1>So Darwin used to amuse himself in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Darwinian way.</v>

651
00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:44.970
<v Speaker 1>He'd go to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a zoo or a rep place that shows</v>

652
00:35:44.971 --> 00:35:46.740
<v Speaker 1>reptiles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what they're called,</v>

653
00:35:46.741 --> 00:35:50.370
<v Speaker 1>but they had one glass cage where there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was some kind of poisonous snake,</v>

654
00:35:50.371 --> 00:35:51.204
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a cobra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Darwin would put his face right up </v>

655
00:35:53.221 --> 00:35:55.450
<v Speaker 1>against the glass and the kroeber would </v>
<v Speaker 1>go whack.</v>

656
00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:57.630
<v Speaker 1>And he jumped back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>

657
00:35:58.530 --> 00:35:59.363
<v Speaker 1>he did that many times because he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>curious about whether or not he could </v>

658
00:36:01.291 --> 00:36:05.430
<v Speaker 1>actually bring the snake avoidance </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflex under conscious control.</v>

659
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:07.440
<v Speaker 1>And he couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time the snake jumped,</v>

660
00:36:07.441 --> 00:36:09.240
<v Speaker 1>he jumped backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't control it.</v>

661
00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:10.613
<v Speaker 1>And so that's because all the primates </v>
<v Speaker 1>that could control it when there were </v>

662
00:36:14.101 --> 00:36:18.210
<v Speaker 1>snakes biting them are dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was,</v>

663
00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Darwin was the beneficiary of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Darwinian process in that,</v>

664
00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:23.070
<v Speaker 1>in that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

665
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.580
<v Speaker 1>so the point is your body's conserved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these low level,</v>

666
00:36:26.581 --> 00:36:30.290
<v Speaker 1>fast operating circuits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're a simple machine in a sort</v>

667
00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.940
<v Speaker 1>of complex machine and an extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex machine.</v>

668
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:33.983
<v Speaker 1>And then something that's so complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can't even think about it as a </v>

669
00:36:36.391 --> 00:36:38.730
<v Speaker 1>machine and you're all those things at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>

670
00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:46.003
<v Speaker 1>And there's Swanson's take on how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>motor system and the hypothalamus are </v>

671
00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:51.330
<v Speaker 1>integrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's quite nice.</v>

672
00:36:51.331 --> 00:36:54.360
<v Speaker 1>He shows that the hypothalamic </v>
<v Speaker 1>controller,</v>

673
00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:55.553
<v Speaker 1>so that's one of the circuits that we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been talking about that are responsible </v>

674
00:36:57.631 --> 00:37:00.630
<v Speaker 1>for a basic motivated state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets sensory input,</v>

675
00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:04.500
<v Speaker 1>behavioral state input.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's about the body and the input from</v>

676
00:37:04.501 --> 00:37:05.334
<v Speaker 1>the cerebral hemispheres.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hypothetically that's thought or or </v>

677
00:37:08.131 --> 00:37:11.070
<v Speaker 1>voluntary action plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

678
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:15.240
<v Speaker 1>And then it has output to the motor </v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern initiator,</v>

679
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:19.740
<v Speaker 1>the generators and the motor neuron </v>
<v Speaker 1>pools and then you act lovely.</v>

680
00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:21.510
<v Speaker 1>It's a beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful model.</v>

681
00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:26.880
<v Speaker 1>And so you can see that it maps very </v>
<v Speaker 1>nicely onto that with the sort of higher</v>

682
00:37:26.881 --> 00:37:27.714
<v Speaker 1>order levels of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the hierarchy of sensory motor </v>

683
00:37:31.291 --> 00:37:32.124
<v Speaker 1>framing associated with cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstractions in the lowest levels </v>

684
00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:39.240
<v Speaker 1>associated with the sorts of things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do with your spine.</v>

685
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:41.223
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I flip this upside down here because </v>

686
00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:46.480
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

687
00:37:46.481 --> 00:37:50.280
<v Speaker 1>I've been very interested in how people </v>
<v Speaker 1>get traumatized and it's easier to think</v>

688
00:37:50.281 --> 00:37:51.114
<v Speaker 1>of trauma when you flip the thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because once you develop the higher </v>

689
00:37:54.511 --> 00:37:56.340
<v Speaker 1>order abstractions cortically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

690
00:37:56.341 --> 00:37:56.821
<v Speaker 1>he'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

691
00:37:56.821 --> 00:37:58.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm a good person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

692
00:37:58.650 --> 00:37:59.483
<v Speaker 1>Then that's sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you're a good person or </v>

693
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:05.550
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes good starts to become a</v>
<v Speaker 1>box.</v>

694
00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:09.990
<v Speaker 1>The box within which all the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are associated with it are put,</v>

695
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:12.330
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the dangers of abstraction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

696
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:13.583
<v Speaker 1>And categorization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you couldn't think of </v>

697
00:38:15.991 --> 00:38:16.824
<v Speaker 1>yourself as a good or bad person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you didn't have that capacity </v>

698
00:38:19.771 --> 00:38:23.220
<v Speaker 1>for that level of abstraction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like a binary abstraction,</v>

699
00:38:23.221 --> 00:38:25.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good is,</v>

700
00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:26.393
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

701
00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:32.700
<v Speaker 1>one in and bad is zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a really,</v>

702
00:38:32.701 --> 00:38:35.120
<v Speaker 1>it's a really simple,</v>

703
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:37.053
<v Speaker 2>and so if someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do something that a good person </v>

704
00:38:39.611 --> 00:38:40.444
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well clearly you don't fit into the one </v>

705
00:38:42.521 --> 00:38:44.380
<v Speaker 2>category because a good person wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

706
00:38:44.381 --> 00:38:49.000
<v Speaker 2>So maybe you fit into the zero category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's that capacity for abstraction</v>

707
00:38:49.001 --> 00:38:49.834
<v Speaker 2>is also precisely the sort of thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>allows human beings to undermine </v>

708
00:38:52.031 --> 00:38:52.864
<v Speaker 2>themselves with thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because once you have that capacity for </v>

709
00:38:55.961 --> 00:38:56.794
<v Speaker 2>abstraction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can make these ridiculous over </v>

710
00:38:58.371 --> 00:38:59.650
<v Speaker 2>generalizations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

711
00:38:59.651 --> 00:39:01.570
<v Speaker 2>they're really simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a good person.</v>

712
00:39:01.571 --> 00:39:02.404
<v Speaker 2>I'm a horrible person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's what how someone who's </v>

713
00:39:04.451 --> 00:39:07.660
<v Speaker 2>really depressed thinks whenever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever anything goes wrong.</v>

714
00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:08.793
<v Speaker 2>And so it's the danger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the powerful danger of abstraction is </v>

715
00:39:11.231 --> 00:39:12.064
<v Speaker 2>that you can make a terrible mistake and</v>
<v Speaker 2>overgeneralization this is partly </v>

716
00:39:15.731 --> 00:39:17.740
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

717
00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:18.753
<v Speaker 2>let's say a hard know you're out with </v>
<v Speaker 2>your girlfriend and you flirt with </v>

718
00:39:23.351 --> 00:39:26.440
<v Speaker 2>someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

719
00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:30.840
<v Speaker 1>so what does that say about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>character?</v>

720
00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:32.633
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she might think that puts you in the </v>

721
00:39:33.271 --> 00:39:35.550
<v Speaker 1>zero category like now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

722
00:39:35.551 --> 00:39:37.560
<v Speaker 1>You're not a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

723
00:39:37.561 --> 00:39:38.640
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's complicated.</v>

724
00:39:38.641 --> 00:39:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Is that or is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

725
00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:44.160
<v Speaker 1>do you belong in that zero category?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She might treat you like that for a week</v>

726
00:39:44.161 --> 00:39:45.390
<v Speaker 1>or two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

727
00:39:45.391 --> 00:39:46.224
<v Speaker 1>should you be taking yourself apart </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely because you've made that </v>

728
00:39:48.571 --> 00:39:49.404
<v Speaker 1>error?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or should you seek farther down the </v>

729
00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:52.793
<v Speaker 1>chain of abstractions for a more </v>
<v Speaker 1>specific mistake and or should she help </v>

730
00:39:56.041 --> 00:39:56.910
<v Speaker 1>you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

731
00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:58.290
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not a complete zero.</v>

732
00:39:58.291 --> 00:39:58.980
<v Speaker 1>You're more like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

733
00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:00.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>0.1,</v>

734
00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:01.493
<v Speaker 1>she could help you figure out exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>where in your personality hierarchy you </v>

735
00:40:04.381 --> 00:40:06.810
<v Speaker 1>have this fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So being that it's a fault,</v>

736
00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:07.973
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's an indication that the </v>

737
00:40:08.521 --> 00:40:10.380
<v Speaker 1>relationship is over who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows.</v>

738
00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:11.693
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted you to show you that because </v>

739
00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:15.533
<v Speaker 1>then you can develop a sense of how this</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical system can also lead to </v>

740
00:40:18.721 --> 00:40:22.620
<v Speaker 1>cataclysmic overgeneralization and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's associated with lots of different</v>

741
00:40:22.621 --> 00:40:23.454
<v Speaker 1>mental illnesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially depression because depressed </v>

742
00:40:25.411 --> 00:40:29.970
<v Speaker 1>people generally go from a small mistake</v>
<v Speaker 1>while a mistake,</v>

743
00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:31.403
<v Speaker 1>hard to parameterize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right to the highest level of </v>

744
00:40:34.081 --> 00:40:35.070
<v Speaker 1>abstraction say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

745
00:40:35.071 --> 00:40:37.170
<v Speaker 1>I've made error a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore I'm useless,</v>

746
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:38.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are therefore I bad?</v>

747
00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:42.000
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a two undifferentiated,</v>

748
00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:49.500
<v Speaker 1>I put that in there to remind you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these little things</v>

749
00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:56.160
<v Speaker 2>are informed</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the underlying hypothalamic circuits.</v>

750
00:40:59.170 --> 00:41:03.820
<v Speaker 1>So you know that whole hierarchy has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be managed and how it's conditioned.</v>

751
00:41:03.821 --> 00:41:07.480
<v Speaker 1>That whole hierarchy of motor output,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of it is conditioned by,</v>

752
00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:08.493
<v Speaker 1>and this is sort of like an output or an</v>
<v Speaker 1>input system that Swanson didn't talk </v>

753
00:41:11.561 --> 00:41:12.940
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of sensory,</v>

754
00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:16.360
<v Speaker 1>that whole motor sensory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensory,</v>

755
00:41:16.361 --> 00:41:18.550
<v Speaker 1>motor hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensory motor perception,</v>

756
00:41:18.551 --> 00:41:19.384
<v Speaker 1>action hierarchy will say has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed so that your basic </v>

757
00:41:23.381 --> 00:41:26.770
<v Speaker 1>motivational states stay satiated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

758
00:41:26.771 --> 00:41:30.160
<v Speaker 1>Because otherwise you get thirsty enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you die or you get hungry enough and</v>

759
00:41:30.161 --> 00:41:30.994
<v Speaker 1>you die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have to organize your </v>

760
00:41:33.441 --> 00:41:37.280
<v Speaker 1>behavior so that those basic motivations</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay fulfilled.</v>

761
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:40.430
<v Speaker 1>So each of the little,</v>

762
00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:41.830
<v Speaker 2>okay</v>

763
00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:42.663
<v Speaker 1>ovals that make up that hierarchy have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be organized and laid out with that </v>

764
00:41:47.531 --> 00:41:48.364
<v Speaker 1>set of limitations in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then of course there's a higher </v>

765
00:41:50.111 --> 00:41:53.980
<v Speaker 1>order limitation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is more the one that piaget talked</v>

766
00:41:53.981 --> 00:41:54.814
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that not only do you have to </v>

767
00:41:56.141 --> 00:41:56.974
<v Speaker 1>organize your internal hierarchies to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take care of all of your basic </v>

768
00:42:00.191 --> 00:42:02.380
<v Speaker 1>motivations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to do that well,</v>

769
00:42:02.381 --> 00:42:03.214
<v Speaker 1>everyone else is doing the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in some sense the hypothalamic </v>

770
00:42:06.731 --> 00:42:07.564
<v Speaker 1>system that's generating the impetus for</v>
<v Speaker 1>these layers and layers of motor output </v>

771
00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:16.600
<v Speaker 1>also has to do so in a social context </v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise,</v>

772
00:42:16.601 --> 00:42:17.434
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fight to the death over a stick of </v>

773
00:42:18.971 --> 00:42:19.804
<v Speaker 1>bread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems like a very </v>

774
00:42:20.501 --> 00:42:23.080
<v Speaker 1>counterproductive thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

775
00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:29.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to point out to you how many </v>
<v Speaker 1>parameters those,</v>

776
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:33.830
<v Speaker 1>that hierarchical organization has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>meet simultaneously.</v>

777
00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:35.323
<v Speaker 1>Also that one of the implications of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is that it's not an arbitrary </v>

778
00:42:38.751 --> 00:42:39.950
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

779
00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:44.240
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the problems I have with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the radical moral relativists stats.</v>

780
00:42:44.241 --> 00:42:45.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

781
00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:47.323
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For you to set up your perceptual and </v>

782
00:42:50.271 --> 00:42:51.104
<v Speaker 1>behavioral system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to solve a whole bunch of </v>

783
00:42:53.571 --> 00:42:54.404
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in they're really complex problems </v>

784
00:42:55.761 --> 00:42:56.594
<v Speaker 1>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're kind of arbitrary in some </v>

785
00:42:57.471 --> 00:43:00.300
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you get hungry and you need deet.</v>

786
00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:01.153
<v Speaker 1>It's arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is you can't fill </v>

787
00:43:03.321 --> 00:43:05.990
<v Speaker 1>that hierarchy with just any old thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

788
00:43:05.991 --> 00:43:10.970
<v Speaker 1>not only does it have to work to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the complex parts of you functioning</v>

789
00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:14.600
<v Speaker 1>here and now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has to keep them functioning here</v>

790
00:43:14.601 --> 00:43:15.434
<v Speaker 1>and now in a way that doesn't disturb </v>
<v Speaker 1>them functioning tomorrow or the next </v>

791
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:19.910
<v Speaker 1>day or the next week or the next month.</v>

792
00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:23.390
<v Speaker 1>So that's integration across time spans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a killer,</v>

793
00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:24.493
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause he can't just go out tonight and </v>

794
00:43:25.401 --> 00:43:27.260
<v Speaker 1>drink 40 ounces of vodka and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

795
00:43:27.261 --> 00:43:31.010
<v Speaker 1>write the test on Thursday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a probably not.</v>

796
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:34.040
<v Speaker 1>So some of you might try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

797
00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:35.593
<v Speaker 1>but then you also have to organize your </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior in the here and now with your </v>

798
00:43:40.011 --> 00:43:40.844
<v Speaker 1>behavior spread across timeframes in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>presence of other people who are also </v>

799
00:43:44.481 --> 00:43:46.730
<v Speaker 1>organizing their behavior across </v>
<v Speaker 1>timeframes.</v>

800
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.863
<v Speaker 1>It's like once you put that many </v>
<v Speaker 1>parameters on the organization of a </v>

801
00:43:50.061 --> 00:43:50.894
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see right away that it can </v>

802
00:43:52.911 --> 00:43:54.830
<v Speaker 1>hardly be arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

803
00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:57.560
<v Speaker 1>it's tightly constrained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

804
00:43:57.561 --> 00:44:00.410
<v Speaker 1>So here's some basic emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about basic motivations.</v>

805
00:44:00.411 --> 00:44:04.130
<v Speaker 1>And so the web we're going to do in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple way is we're going to divide them</v>

806
00:44:04.131 --> 00:44:07.040
<v Speaker 1>into two positive emotions and negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>

807
00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:08.053
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that basically gives you </v>

808
00:44:08.991 --> 00:44:10.460
<v Speaker 1>extroversion and neuroticism.</v>

809
00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:15.320
<v Speaker 1>So positive emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kind of fall into two classes.</v>

810
00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:20.930
<v Speaker 1>The one class is the positive emotion </v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel when you,</v>

811
00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.470
<v Speaker 1>when you run a motivational frame to its</v>
<v Speaker 1>limit.</v>

812
00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:27.710
<v Speaker 1>So you're hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go have a peanut butter sandwich and</v>

813
00:44:27.711 --> 00:44:29.210
<v Speaker 1>then you're no longer hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

814
00:44:29.211 --> 00:44:34.211
<v Speaker 1>So what's the state?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you define the state after you've</v>

815
00:44:34.771 --> 00:44:37.290
<v Speaker 1>eaten your peanut butter sandwich and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're no longer hungry?</v>

816
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:39.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

817
00:44:39.631 --> 00:44:40.464
<v Speaker 1>you're not jumping up and down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheering like someone who just made a </v>

818
00:44:42.091 --> 00:44:42.960
<v Speaker 1>touchdown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

819
00:44:42.961 --> 00:44:45.390
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that kind of enthusiastic,</v>

820
00:44:45.391 --> 00:44:47.940
<v Speaker 1>positive emotion that you see when </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are celebrating,</v>

821
00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:51.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more like satisfaction.</v>

822
00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:54.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually technically what </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's known as satiation.</v>

823
00:44:55.440 --> 00:45:00.420
<v Speaker 1>And so when a motivational routine runs </v>
<v Speaker 1>successfully,</v>

824
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:01.463
<v Speaker 1>what happens is it eliminates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it eliminates the necessity for it to </v>

825
00:45:04.681 --> 00:45:08.080
<v Speaker 1>exist temporarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically what happens is you run A,</v>

826
00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:10.980
<v Speaker 1>a framework to its logical conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poof,</v>

827
00:45:10.981 --> 00:45:13.680
<v Speaker 1>it disappears because it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

828
00:45:13.681 --> 00:45:14.514
<v Speaker 1>you might be satisfied about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's the next thing that happens </v>

829
00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.710
<v Speaker 1>is another motivational framework pops </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and you're,</v>

830
00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the same game.</v>

831
00:45:21.271 --> 00:45:25.500
<v Speaker 1>It says office fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

832
00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:27.113
<v Speaker 1>it's satiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is t the term satiation is </v>

833
00:45:30.901 --> 00:45:34.230
<v Speaker 1>technically use to describe the state of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

834
00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:38.160
<v Speaker 1>It's characteristic of the successful </v>
<v Speaker 1>execution of a motivated frame.</v>

835
00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:40.920
<v Speaker 1>It's also known as conservatory reward,</v>

836
00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:43.453
<v Speaker 1>consummation consume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's associated with </v>

837
00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:52.810
<v Speaker 1>unconditioned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an unconditioned response</v>

838
00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:55.680
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means you don't have to learn it.</v>

839
00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.950
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an unconditioned positive response.</v>

840
00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:00.653
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that means that satiating stimuli </v>

841
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.053
<v Speaker 1>when delivered to a creature in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proper motivational frame have the </v>

842
00:46:09.121 --> 00:46:12.480
<v Speaker 1>properties of unconditioned rewards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get three things there.</v>

843
00:46:12.481 --> 00:46:13.314
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the satiation brings the moated frame </v>

844
00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:15.653
<v Speaker 1>motivated frame to an end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The satiation is also known as consumer </v>

845
00:46:18.421 --> 00:46:19.254
<v Speaker 1>Tory reward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conservatory reward is very similar to </v>

846
00:46:21.511 --> 00:46:25.500
<v Speaker 1>what the behavior is described as </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconditioned reward,</v>

847
00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:27.990
<v Speaker 1>unlearned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can,</v>

848
00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:30.840
<v Speaker 1>you can stack each of those things to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know on top of each other.</v>

849
00:46:30.841 --> 00:46:31.674
<v Speaker 1>And then you've got the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other kind of positive emotion is </v>

850
00:46:34.831 --> 00:46:35.664
<v Speaker 1>the positive emotion that you feel when </v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like you might get a </v>

851
00:46:37.801 --> 00:46:39.120
<v Speaker 1>conservatory reward,</v>

852
00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:41.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

853
00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Hope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>curiosity,</v>

854
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:45.520
<v Speaker 1>anticipation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excitement,</v>

855
00:46:45.521 --> 00:46:46.354
<v Speaker 1>enthusiasm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the positive emotions that we </v>

856
00:46:48.311 --> 00:46:49.144
<v Speaker 1>think of as really like happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy usually has to do with evidence </v>

857
00:46:53.201 --> 00:46:57.580
<v Speaker 1>that your pursuit of a valued </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatory reward is going well.</v>

858
00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that this,</v>

859
00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:00.923
<v Speaker 1>that's incentive reward and the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called incentive reward is because </v>

860
00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:07.960
<v Speaker 1>you're incentivized to move forward to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reward and the moving forward.</v>

861
00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:10.990
<v Speaker 1>The impulse to move forward towards a </v>
<v Speaker 1>desired goal.</v>

862
00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:14.710
<v Speaker 1>That's what your positive emotion </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>

863
00:47:14.711 --> 00:47:15.544
<v Speaker 1>the dopaminergic systems that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>nestled have the roots in the </v>

864
00:47:18.131 --> 00:47:22.300
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they motivate you to do.</v>

865
00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:23.583
<v Speaker 1>That's what positive emotion is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally positive emotion is </v>

866
00:47:25.661 --> 00:47:27.280
<v Speaker 1>there's something good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go get it.</v>

867
00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:28.323
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go get part that's </v>

868
00:47:29.561 --> 00:47:32.110
<v Speaker 1>associated with excitement and positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

869
00:47:32.111 --> 00:47:34.090
<v Speaker 1>It's what you feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're an extrovert,</v>

870
00:47:34.091 --> 00:47:37.630
<v Speaker 1>you want to go to a party and so you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably more excited about going to the</v>

871
00:47:37.631 --> 00:47:37.900
<v Speaker 1>party.</v>

872
00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Then you will be when you get there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

873
00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:40.923
<v Speaker 1>because it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the apprehension of the reward </v>

874
00:47:42.791 --> 00:47:45.580
<v Speaker 1>that's with human beings because we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>such weird creatures.</v>

875
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:46.623
<v Speaker 1>So often the apprehension of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatory ward is a more powerful </v>

876
00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:50.523
<v Speaker 1>emotion than the emotion that's actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt as a consequence of gaining the </v>

877
00:47:53.801 --> 00:47:56.350
<v Speaker 1>reward itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly,</v>

878
00:47:56.351 --> 00:47:58.090
<v Speaker 1>and this is where it gets a little more </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated.</v>

879
00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:00.640
<v Speaker 1>That's part of it because we're so </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody exploratory,</v>

880
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:01.863
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's things that you can learn </v>

881
00:48:04.541 --> 00:48:06.970
<v Speaker 1>about that are associated with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatory reward.</v>

882
00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:12.500
<v Speaker 1>Those are conditioned rewards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So an incentive reward and the condition</v>

883
00:48:12.501 --> 00:48:13.334
<v Speaker 1>reward are in the same category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although not all incentive rewards are </v>

884
00:48:17.771 --> 00:48:18.604
<v Speaker 1>learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where the behaviors went wrong </v>

885
00:48:19.661 --> 00:48:22.660
<v Speaker 1>because the behavior's thought there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>consumer Tory rewards.</v>

886
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Those are unconditioned rewards to get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioned to come.</v>

887
00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:31.330
<v Speaker 1>If you condition a stimulus to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconditioned reward,</v>

888
00:48:31.331 --> 00:48:34.810
<v Speaker 1>you get a condition stimulus with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioned reward as a response.</v>

889
00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:35.643
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with that line of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking is that there's actually </v>

890
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:42.220
<v Speaker 1>incentive reward circuitry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just secondary learning.</v>

891
00:48:42.221 --> 00:48:44.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like incentive rewards have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>around so long.</v>

892
00:48:44.891 --> 00:48:47.950
<v Speaker 1>So those are things that indicate that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatory reward is coming.</v>

893
00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:49.023
<v Speaker 1>They've been around so long that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain has developed its own circuit for </v>

894
00:48:51.461 --> 00:48:52.294
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the one that produces </v>

895
00:48:53.021 --> 00:48:57.070
<v Speaker 1>positive emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's also produced by the way,</v>

896
00:48:57.310 --> 00:48:58.143
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're taking a drug of some sort </v>

897
00:48:59.981 --> 00:49:00.814
<v Speaker 1>that you really like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's because it's activating this </v>

898
00:49:03.581 --> 00:49:04.414
<v Speaker 1>dopaminergic incentive reward system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you take a drug that activates </v>

899
00:49:07.781 --> 00:49:08.614
<v Speaker 1>conservatory reward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just like lay in front of the fire </v>

900
00:49:10.121 --> 00:49:11.800
<v Speaker 1>like a sleeping dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

901
00:49:11.801 --> 00:49:13.210
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not exciting.</v>

902
00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:14.890
<v Speaker 1>It's cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amphetamines,</v>

903
00:49:14.891 --> 00:49:18.460
<v Speaker 1>alcohol for lots of people nail the </v>
<v Speaker 1>incentive reward system.</v>

904
00:49:18.461 --> 00:49:19.294
<v Speaker 1>And that's the dopaminergic exploratory </v>
<v Speaker 1>system that emerges out of the </v>

905
00:49:21.611 --> 00:49:25.150
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also the thing that learns what</v>

906
00:49:25.151 --> 00:49:27.490
<v Speaker 1>to associate with conservatory rewards.</v>

907
00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:31.960
<v Speaker 1>So I know that's a lot to take in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but well it doesn't matter.</v>

908
00:49:31.961 --> 00:49:33.520
<v Speaker 1>That's how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

909
00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:39.650
<v Speaker 1>so the approach systems respond to cues </v>
<v Speaker 1>of consumer Tory reward.</v>

910
00:49:39.970 --> 00:49:44.570
<v Speaker 1>And they also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also respond to a large set of um,</v>

911
00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:48.280
<v Speaker 1>biologically prepared stimuli smells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

912
00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:52.990
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you should approach good things,</v>

913
00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:56.050
<v Speaker 1>but if a bad thing happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should you do?</v>

914
00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:58.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing you should do is stop.</v>

915
00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Another thing you should do is get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell out of there.</v>

916
00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:02.043
<v Speaker 1>So there's a constellation of negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions that are associated with </v>

917
00:50:05.441 --> 00:50:06.274
<v Speaker 1>defense and avoidance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we kind of ran through those </v>

918
00:50:08.171 --> 00:50:09.130
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pain,</v>

919
00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:10.270
<v Speaker 1>grief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frustration,</v>

920
00:50:10.271 --> 00:50:13.270
<v Speaker 1>disappointment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then fear,</v>

921
00:50:13.271 --> 00:50:18.271
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of what you learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You learn that things to be feared.</v>

922
00:50:19.001 --> 00:50:21.580
<v Speaker 1>Signal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>primary pain,</v>

923
00:50:21.581 --> 00:50:22.930
<v Speaker 1>stimulus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

924
00:50:22.931 --> 00:50:24.520
<v Speaker 1>so a child is going to be afraid of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>needle,</v>

925
00:50:24.521 --> 00:50:26.530
<v Speaker 1>especially if the child's got a needle </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

926
00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:28.033
<v Speaker 1>Most children are smart enough to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out what they should be afraid of the </v>

927
00:50:29.631 --> 00:50:30.464
<v Speaker 1>needle even when they haven't had it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is is that if you come </v>

928
00:50:33.951 --> 00:50:34.784
<v Speaker 1>into contact with something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>already caused you pain and now there's </v>

929
00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:40.580
<v Speaker 1>something that only signals that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to happen,</v>

930
00:50:40.581 --> 00:50:44.040
<v Speaker 1>that's when you experience fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

931
00:50:44.041 --> 00:50:44.874
<v Speaker 1>And fear is its own circuit again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is where the behaviors in some </v>

932
00:50:47.931 --> 00:50:48.764
<v Speaker 1>sense wind a little bit wrong to cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>they thought of unconditioned </v>

933
00:50:50.931 --> 00:50:51.764
<v Speaker 1>punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which produces pain as the primary </v>

934
00:50:54.291 --> 00:50:57.350
<v Speaker 1>motivational system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it would be unconditioned punishment,</v>

935
00:50:57.530 --> 00:51:01.070
<v Speaker 1>unconditioned reward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there were things you learned about</v>

936
00:51:01.071 --> 00:51:02.830
<v Speaker 1>those that produced conditioned </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment.</v>

937
00:51:02.831 --> 00:51:04.370
<v Speaker 1>Conditioned reward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

938
00:51:04.371 --> 00:51:07.040
<v Speaker 1>But all of those have circuits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>independent circuits.</v>

939
00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:08.233
<v Speaker 1>So the defense and avoidance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative emotions seem to be roughly </v>

940
00:51:11.331 --> 00:51:13.220
<v Speaker 1>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and fear.</v>

941
00:51:13.221 --> 00:51:14.054
<v Speaker 1>But then there's discussed and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been looking at discussed a lot </v>

942
00:51:16.911 --> 00:51:19.220
<v Speaker 1>lately and it doesn't load on </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism,</v>

943
00:51:19.221 --> 00:51:20.750
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem to load on neuroticism.</v>

944
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:22.760
<v Speaker 1>So it's its own circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

945
00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:25.640
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's another one.</v>

946
00:51:25.641 --> 00:51:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Other complexity that you need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>grapple with,</v>

947
00:51:28.341 --> 00:51:31.850
<v Speaker 1>which is there are things that hurt that</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you pain.</v>

948
00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:36.560
<v Speaker 1>There are things that are satiating and </v>
<v Speaker 1>letter our conservatory reward.</v>

949
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:39.410
<v Speaker 1>Then there are things that signal each </v>
<v Speaker 1>of those,</v>

950
00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:42.830
<v Speaker 1>but there's one class of stimuli,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

951
00:51:42.831 --> 00:51:45.890
<v Speaker 1>or things that you're going to encounter</v>
<v Speaker 1>that or a paradoxical,</v>

952
00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:49.310
<v Speaker 1>and that's the class of things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't understand.</v>

953
00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:52.400
<v Speaker 1>That's novelty and novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

954
00:51:52.401 --> 00:51:53.234
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's novelty itself that sort of </v>

955
00:51:54.681 --> 00:51:57.800
<v Speaker 1>associated with what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists are primarily concerned</v>

956
00:51:57.801 --> 00:51:58.634
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of the revelation of meaning </v>

957
00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:01.243
<v Speaker 1>because the revelation of beating is </v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly associated with you encountering </v>

958
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.980
<v Speaker 1>something that you haven't already </v>
<v Speaker 1>understood.</v>

959
00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:07.933
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You explore that new information comes </v>

960
00:52:09.771 --> 00:52:11.450
<v Speaker 1>out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new you comes out of it.</v>

961
00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:14.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're going from point a to point b,</v>

962
00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:17.630
<v Speaker 1>what might happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

963
00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:19.753
<v Speaker 1>things might happen that that appear to </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrate that you're on the right </v>

964
00:52:22.071 --> 00:52:24.830
<v Speaker 1>track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that makes you happy.</v>

965
00:52:24.831 --> 00:52:26.570
<v Speaker 1>That's the yellow box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive emotion.</v>

966
00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:28.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

967
00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:29.803
<v Speaker 1>your pathway is being facilitated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why tools are sort of sort of </v>

968
00:52:32.571 --> 00:52:35.720
<v Speaker 1>in that category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you can be moving towards point b and</v>

969
00:52:35.721 --> 00:52:36.554
<v Speaker 1>you get something gets in your way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that might be something that hurts </v>

970
00:52:38.871 --> 00:52:40.340
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be,</v>

971
00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:42.913
<v Speaker 1>and that hurt would be pain or </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointment or frustration or grief </v>

972
00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:47.750
<v Speaker 1>or something that signals that you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>get hurt,</v>

973
00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:48.913
<v Speaker 1>which is threat not produces fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the positive emotion is moving </v>

974
00:52:53.541 --> 00:52:58.010
<v Speaker 1>you towards the desired goal in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion is protecting you.</v>

975
00:52:58.580 --> 00:52:59.413
<v Speaker 1>And so if a negative things happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll stop and then you'll reconfigure </v>

976
00:53:03.201 --> 00:53:04.034
<v Speaker 1>the behavior that you're using or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>framework in order to get around the </v>

977
00:53:06.741 --> 00:53:09.770
<v Speaker 1>obstacle and to continue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or if it's a bad enough obstacle,</v>

978
00:53:09.771 --> 00:53:11.270
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

979
00:53:11.271 --> 00:53:12.104
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

980
00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:16.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm too tired to eat and I'm too hungry </v>
<v Speaker 1>to sleep.</v>

981
00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:18.270
<v Speaker 1>That happens to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

982
00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:23.220
<v Speaker 1>It's a conflict of motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you get up and you go into the</v>

983
00:53:23.221 --> 00:53:25.200
<v Speaker 1>cupboard and you find out that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing to eat,</v>

984
00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:26.041
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

985
00:53:26.041 --> 00:53:27.690
<v Speaker 1>to hell with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'll just go to sleep.</v>

986
00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:30.540
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes the way you solve a problem</v>

987
00:53:30.541 --> 00:53:31.374
<v Speaker 1>is by flipping the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're not going to solve that </v>

988
00:53:32.881 --> 00:53:35.160
<v Speaker 1>problem right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll turn to another problem some.</v>

989
00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:37.410
<v Speaker 1>And that's an explorer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an exploratory move.</v>

990
00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you operate within the frame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

991
00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:42.870
<v Speaker 1>you go to the cupboard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cupboard is bare.</v>

992
00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:44.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

993
00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:45.183
<v Speaker 1>but you're hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you walked down to the corner store </v>

994
00:53:46.121 --> 00:53:46.954
<v Speaker 1>and you get something to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that way you've sort of stayed </v>

995
00:53:49.121 --> 00:53:51.760
<v Speaker 1>within the frame and altered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

996
00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:52.603
<v Speaker 1>you've altered your behavior to too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've thought up another path and </v>

997
00:53:57.201 --> 00:54:01.580
<v Speaker 1>altered your behavior so that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated state can run to completion.</v>

998
00:54:05.850 --> 00:54:06.683
<v Speaker 1>Here's another way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be moving from point a to b and </v>

999
00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:14.850
<v Speaker 1>what you predict or want is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing that keeps your mood</v>

1000
00:54:14.851 --> 00:54:17.400
<v Speaker 1>straight and you happy and that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>you whoa.</v>

1001
00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:18.263
<v Speaker 1>That's a promise with the promise is </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get what you want and </v>

1002
00:54:20.971 --> 00:54:23.250
<v Speaker 1>that fills you with hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's positive emotion.</v>

1003
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:25.620
<v Speaker 1>Or you can have an unpredicted outcome </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>

1004
00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:26.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you uh,</v>

1005
00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:30.030
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] you're supposed to be going </v>
<v Speaker 1>out with your friend,</v>

1006
00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:33.960
<v Speaker 1>you go to the door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you knock and there's nobody there.</v>

1007
00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:35.910
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's up with that?</v>

1008
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:37.830
<v Speaker 1>And so it's in a sense when that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>

1009
00:54:37.831 --> 00:54:39.810
<v Speaker 1>there's like a hole in your framework,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1010
00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:42.990
<v Speaker 1>cause your framework was predicated on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the presence of your friend,</v>

1011
00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:45.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a presupposition.</v>

1012
00:54:45.810 --> 00:54:46.643
<v Speaker 1>And so now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you'll run out of behavioral </v>

1013
00:54:47.791 --> 00:54:50.220
<v Speaker 1>routine and one of your presuppositions </v>
<v Speaker 1>is wrong.</v>

1014
00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:53.970
<v Speaker 1>And it's sort of like there's a hole in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your theory and the whole,</v>

1015
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.030
<v Speaker 1>you sort of drop into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you drop into that hole,</v>

1016
00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:57.953
<v Speaker 1>you get anxious because you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what this unexpected thing </v>

1017
00:55:01.471 --> 00:55:05.970
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And behind that you get exploratory.</v>

1018
00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:07.380
<v Speaker 1>So with most people,</v>

1019
00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:09.563
<v Speaker 1>they're going to get afraid first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to have negative emotion </v>

1020
00:55:10.951 --> 00:55:11.784
<v Speaker 1>first when they're little plan is blown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if nothing additionally awful </v>

1021
00:55:15.061 --> 00:55:15.894
<v Speaker 1>happens and if they don't drive </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves crazy with some hypothesis </v>

1022
00:55:18.691 --> 00:55:21.870
<v Speaker 1>about he doesn't like me anymore and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>no one likes me anymore,</v>

1023
00:55:21.871 --> 00:55:24.000
<v Speaker 1>so I'm a terrible person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1024
00:55:24.001 --> 00:55:27.030
<v Speaker 1>then the x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once they calm down a little bit,</v>

1025
00:55:27.031 --> 00:55:31.110
<v Speaker 1>the exploration circuit will come up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they'll walk somewhere else,</v>

1026
00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:33.480
<v Speaker 1>go to a bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe they'll stand there and think,</v>

1027
00:55:33.481 --> 00:55:34.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1028
00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:36.150
<v Speaker 1>this didn't work out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what else could I do?</v>

1029
00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:40.140
<v Speaker 1>And emotionally stable person say a non </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurotic personnel flipped it out really</v>

1030
00:55:40.141 --> 00:55:40.974
<v Speaker 1>fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're extroverted and </v>

1031
00:55:41.941 --> 00:55:42.774
<v Speaker 1>open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where someone who's heavy and negative </v>

1032
00:55:44.131 --> 00:55:45.330
<v Speaker 1>emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1033
00:55:45.331 --> 00:55:48.420
<v Speaker 1>the fact that their friend wasn't there </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they told them they would be,</v>

1034
00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:50.880
<v Speaker 1>that might just produce a hole that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall into and it's,</v>

1035
00:55:50.881 --> 00:55:52.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so deep and painful.</v>

1036
00:55:52.171 --> 00:55:54.420
<v Speaker 1>They just go home and cry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1037
00:55:54.570 --> 00:55:59.070
<v Speaker 1>so the neuroticism and the extroversion </v>
<v Speaker 1>are in some sense,</v>

1038
00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:04.080
<v Speaker 1>they vary with the degree to which the </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion system is strong,</v>

1039
00:56:04.081 --> 00:56:07.530
<v Speaker 1>or the positive emotion system is strong</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're two different systems.</v>

1040
00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:09.690
<v Speaker 1>And so you can think of them in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

1041
00:56:09.691 --> 00:56:10.680
<v Speaker 1>You can think of the mass</v>

1042
00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:17.250
<v Speaker 1>units of positive emotion per unit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>promise.</v>

1043
00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:18.870
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1044
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:19.703
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird thing to try to quantify or</v>
<v Speaker 1>units of negative emotion per unit of </v>

1045
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:26.020
<v Speaker 1>threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1046
00:56:26.021 --> 00:56:26.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone,</v>

1047
00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:29.110
<v Speaker 1>maybe someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a rumor going around that you're</v>

1048
00:56:29.111 --> 00:56:29.944
<v Speaker 1>going to lose your job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well how much should you worry about </v>

1049
00:56:31.901 --> 00:56:33.070
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1050
00:56:33.071 --> 00:56:34.120
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know.</v>

1051
00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:35.800
<v Speaker 1>So how do you decide?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1052
00:56:35.801 --> 00:56:36.700
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1053
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:39.580
<v Speaker 1>you're wiring decide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're high in negative emotion,</v>

1054
00:56:39.581 --> 00:56:41.410
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get all anxious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>freak out about it,</v>

1055
00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:44.110
<v Speaker 1>which might be the right thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you will lose your job.</v>

1056
00:56:44.530 --> 00:56:47.430
<v Speaker 1>And if you're emotionally stable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to thank God.</v>

1057
00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:50.650
<v Speaker 1>I probably won't lose my job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even if I can't,</v>

1058
00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:51.530
<v Speaker 1>even if I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1059
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:55.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's innate or lot of it's innate.</v>

1060
00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:56.523
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1061
00:56:58.670 --> 00:57:01.970
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to recapitulate learning theory,</v>

1062
00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:05.300
<v Speaker 1>behaviorism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are unconditioned rewards.</v>

1063
00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:08.360
<v Speaker 1>Those are rewards you don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn.</v>

1064
00:57:09.290 --> 00:57:12.260
<v Speaker 1>Those are the things that bring a </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated state to its closure,</v>

1065
00:57:13.070 --> 00:57:16.370
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that makes you satisfied.</v>

1066
00:57:16.371 --> 00:57:17.780
<v Speaker 1>Satiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That by the way,</v>

1067
00:57:17.781 --> 00:57:22.520
<v Speaker 1>is associated with Serotonin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Serotonin is a satiating neurochemical,</v>

1068
00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:25.160
<v Speaker 1>so if you're high levels of Serotonin </v>
<v Speaker 1>are high,</v>

1069
00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:26.173
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of satisfied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means you don't experience a lot </v>

1070
00:57:28.161 --> 00:57:30.410
<v Speaker 1>of positive emotion or a lot of negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

1071
00:57:30.411 --> 00:57:33.230
<v Speaker 1>You're just kind of satisfied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a high dominance thing.</v>

1072
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:34.303
<v Speaker 1>It's like all of the consumer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tory rewards are there when you need </v>

1073
00:57:36.681 --> 00:57:37.514
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to worry and you don't </v>

1074
00:57:38.631 --> 00:57:43.550
<v Speaker 1>have to get too excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conditioned rewards or incentive rewards</v>

1075
00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:47.120
<v Speaker 1>indicate progress towards a consumer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consumer Tory reward.</v>

1076
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:48.103
<v Speaker 1>They can be learned or condition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can also be a nate and they're </v>

1077
00:57:50.601 --> 00:57:51.434
<v Speaker 1>associated with dopaminergic activation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the exploration circuit that </v>

1078
00:57:54.741 --> 00:57:56.860
<v Speaker 1>comes out of the hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Half the hymen,</v>

1079
00:57:57.110 --> 00:58:02.110
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus does goal specification</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other half does exploration,</v>

1080
00:58:02.871 --> 00:58:03.704
<v Speaker 1>and so again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're pursuing something that's an </v>

1081
00:58:06.411 --> 00:58:11.411
<v Speaker 1>identifiable goal and you fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you're going to back off.</v>

1082
00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:12.463
<v Speaker 1>That's negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you're going to start to explore </v>

1083
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:15.223
<v Speaker 1>and that's that dopaminergic circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's associated with dopaminergic </v>

1084
00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:20.533
<v Speaker 1>activation,</v>

1085
00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:24.490
<v Speaker 1>exploration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extroversion,</v>

1086
00:58:24.491 --> 00:58:25.720
<v Speaker 1>happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>play,</v>

1087
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:26.583
<v Speaker 1>enthusiasm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assertiveness and the positive element </v>

1088
00:58:28.841 --> 00:58:30.340
<v Speaker 1>of novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1089
00:58:30.341 --> 00:58:33.040
<v Speaker 1>so that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody have any questions?</v>

1090
00:58:33.041 --> 00:58:33.874
<v Speaker 1>I know that's a lot of information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I kind of designed this part of the </v>

1091
00:58:37.031 --> 00:58:37.864
<v Speaker 1>course so that at this point the levels </v>
<v Speaker 1>of analysis would stack up so that you </v>

1092
00:58:41.111 --> 00:58:41.944
<v Speaker 1>could understand them simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the hypothalamus sets up your frames </v>

1093
00:58:47.651 --> 00:58:48.484
<v Speaker 1>of motivation</v>

1094
00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:53.500
<v Speaker 1>running one of those two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the co two.</v>

1095
00:58:53.501 --> 00:58:55.960
<v Speaker 1>It's positive conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That satisfying.</v>

1096
00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:59.830
<v Speaker 1>That's innate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because it's consumer Tory reward.</v>

1097
00:58:59.831 --> 00:59:00.664
<v Speaker 1>You'll work for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything that indicates that that might </v>

1098
00:59:03.101 --> 00:59:05.410
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's incentive reward.</v>

1099
00:59:05.411 --> 00:59:07.570
<v Speaker 1>You can learn that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some of it's also a nate,</v>

1100
00:59:08.590 --> 00:59:11.390
<v Speaker 1>which is where the behaviors didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that cause they thought of all the,</v>

1101
00:59:11.410 --> 00:59:14.240
<v Speaker 1>all the secondary stuff that condition </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff has learned.</v>

1102
00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:16.360
<v Speaker 1>It's not all learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of it's already prepared.</v>

1103
00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:18.370
<v Speaker 1>You see a snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a threat.</v>

1104
00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:22.820
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to learn that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fire is sort of like that as well.</v>

1105
00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood is like that.</v>

1106
00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:27.440
<v Speaker 1>Teeth are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Staring eyes are like that.</v>

1107
00:59:27.441 --> 00:59:30.560
<v Speaker 1>Predatory postures are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1108
00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:34.280
<v Speaker 1>loud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loud vocalizations,</v>

1109
00:59:34.281 --> 00:59:38.720
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're like low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low in frequency,</v>

1110
00:59:39.110 --> 00:59:39.943
<v Speaker 1>they indicate a large animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those things are things you don't </v>

1111
00:59:41.841 --> 00:59:42.674
<v Speaker 1>have to learn to be afraid of because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been so consistently dangerous </v>

1112
00:59:46.011 --> 00:59:46.844
<v Speaker 1>in the past that you've built up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>circuit that aren't responds </v>

1113
00:59:48.651 --> 00:59:50.120
<v Speaker 1>automatically to the question.</v>

1114
00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:57.210
<v Speaker 4>It seems like there will at least.</v>

1115
01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:04.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's complicated,</v>

1116
01:00:04.131 --> 01:00:04.964
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they do play a bit of an </v>

1117
01:00:06.081 --> 01:00:08.360
<v Speaker 1>inhibitory role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're separate circuits,</v>

1118
01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:09.853
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can be very extroverted and very </v>

1119
01:00:11.570 --> 01:00:13.270
<v Speaker 1>high in negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1120
01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:14.173
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can be very emotionally stable </v>

1121
01:00:17.991 --> 01:00:20.300
<v Speaker 1>and very low in extroversion too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1122
01:00:20.301 --> 01:00:22.550
<v Speaker 1>but they are definitely separate things </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1123
01:00:22.551 --> 01:00:23.570
<v Speaker 1>It's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1124
01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:26.210
<v Speaker 1>you can flip from laughing to crying </v>
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly,</v>

1125
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:27.703
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people are very much capable of </v>

1126
01:00:28.911 --> 01:00:31.820
<v Speaker 1>experiencing mixed states of positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and negative emotion.</v>

1127
01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:32.863
<v Speaker 1>Plus there are forms of manic depressive</v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder where people are manic and </v>

1128
01:00:35.721 --> 01:00:36.554
<v Speaker 1>depressed at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I wouldn't recommend the people I </v>

1129
01:00:39.621 --> 01:00:42.290
<v Speaker 1>know that have had that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they seem to think that is certainly not</v>

1130
01:00:42.291 --> 01:00:43.880
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1131
01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:46.003
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1132
01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:49.720
<v Speaker 1>agitation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous agitation.</v>

1133
01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:51.113
<v Speaker 1>So you're probably just sorta like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're deeply confused and you're </v>

1134
01:00:53.471 --> 01:00:56.500
<v Speaker 1>really bothered by it because then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>threat circuits are going,</v>

1135
01:00:56.590 --> 01:00:58.390
<v Speaker 1>but you're also sort of wandering around</v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

1136
01:00:58.391 --> 01:00:59.500
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to do?</v>

1137
01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:00.573
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all like approach behavior </v>

1138
01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:05.870
<v Speaker 1>approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Motivation isn't always positive a,</v>

1139
01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:06.783
<v Speaker 1>I mean most of the time it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but intensity managers and </v>

1140
01:01:09.311 --> 01:01:11.710
<v Speaker 1>controllability matters too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1141
01:01:12.550 --> 01:01:16.120
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unconditioned punishments,</v>

1142
01:01:16.990 --> 01:01:17.823
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally they produce pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also tend to Ha if you ran a </v>

1143
01:01:23.351 --> 01:01:28.240
<v Speaker 1>behavioral routine or a motivated </v>
<v Speaker 1>framework that results in punishment,</v>

1144
01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:30.970
<v Speaker 1>you're less likely to run it again in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>

1145
01:01:31.090 --> 01:01:31.923
<v Speaker 1>That's learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you run a motivated frame and it </v>

1146
01:01:34.271 --> 01:01:35.104
<v Speaker 1>works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're more likely to run it in the </v>

1147
01:01:35.741 --> 01:01:37.560
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's learning too,</v>

1148
01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:39.373
<v Speaker 1>so I'm conditioned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Punishments decrease the probability </v>

1149
01:01:42.911 --> 01:01:46.300
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to run to give and </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational frame because it failed.</v>

1150
01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you run out?</v>

1151
01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:48.790
<v Speaker 1>You got hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1152
01:01:48.791 --> 01:01:52.660
<v Speaker 1>don't do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the purpose of memory and</v>

1153
01:01:52.661 --> 01:01:53.940
<v Speaker 1>the pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like emotions,</v>

1154
01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:55.660
<v Speaker 1>just to say it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our pain,</v>

1155
01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:57.850
<v Speaker 1>frustration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointment,</v>

1156
01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:00.580
<v Speaker 1>grief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sadness is in there as well,</v>

1157
01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:02.770
<v Speaker 1>so those are paying like states of </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion,</v>

1158
01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:04.773
<v Speaker 1>conditioned punishments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are things that indicate that a </v>

1159
01:02:07.601 --> 01:02:10.930
<v Speaker 1>punishment is likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them you can learn.</v>

1160
01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:14.270
<v Speaker 1>Some of them you don't have to because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're already built into you.</v>

1161
01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:17.770
<v Speaker 1>The negative emotions are dampened by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Serotonin.</v>

1162
01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:20.880
<v Speaker 1>That's the brain system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>

1163
01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:23.850
<v Speaker 1>it's the serotonergic system is like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conductor of the orchestra.</v>

1164
01:02:23.851 --> 01:02:27.630
<v Speaker 1>It keeps everything in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in balance and Gabba.</v>

1165
01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:32.070
<v Speaker 1>Gabba is a anxiety lytic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes people less anxious.</v>

1166
01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:33.960
<v Speaker 1>It's endogenous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your brain produces it.</v>

1167
01:02:34.410 --> 01:02:39.290
<v Speaker 1>If you take valium or barbiturates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they act on the Gaba system.</v>

1168
01:02:39.291 --> 01:02:40.124
<v Speaker 1>It's so does alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the reason why people </v>

1169
01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:45.000
<v Speaker 1>like alcohol because it dampens anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now for some people,</v>

1170
01:02:45.001 --> 01:02:48.180
<v Speaker 1>alcohol or also produces dopaminergic </v>
<v Speaker 1>activation.</v>

1171
01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:52.950
<v Speaker 1>So they really like alcohol because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>calms them down like they're not anxious</v>

1172
01:02:52.951 --> 01:02:53.784
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it also feels it produces incentive </v>

1173
01:02:57.031 --> 01:02:59.730
<v Speaker 1>reward activation like cocaine for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for some people,</v>

1174
01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:00.743
<v Speaker 1>alcohol is and absolutely deadly drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can probably find out if you're </v>

1175
01:03:04.051 --> 01:03:07.590
<v Speaker 1>susceptible to alcoholism quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>straightforwardly.</v>

1176
01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:11.370
<v Speaker 1>If you want to find out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit in a bar,</v>

1177
01:03:11.730 --> 01:03:12.563
<v Speaker 1>take your pulse.</v>

1178
01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:14.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1179
01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:17.940
<v Speaker 1>down five shots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four shots.</v>

1180
01:03:17.941 --> 01:03:20.010
<v Speaker 1>If you're little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta get your,</v>

1181
01:03:20.011 --> 01:03:23.430
<v Speaker 1>you got to get your blood alcohol level </v>
<v Speaker 1>above legal intoxication or you won't be</v>

1182
01:03:23.431 --> 01:03:26.220
<v Speaker 1>able to tell and then take your pulse </v>
<v Speaker 1>again 10 minutes later.</v>

1183
01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:29.580
<v Speaker 1>If your pulse has gone up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight beats are more,</v>

1184
01:03:30.090 --> 01:03:34.170
<v Speaker 1>watch it because you're probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>producing an opiate response to alcohol.</v>

1185
01:03:34.350 --> 01:03:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Secondary consequence of the opiod </v>
<v Speaker 1>responses are dopaminergic response,</v>

1186
01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:39.113
<v Speaker 1>reasonable probability that you'll like </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol enough to find it difficult to </v>

1187
01:03:42.421 --> 01:03:44.070
<v Speaker 1>stop drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you start,</v>

1188
01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:45.570
<v Speaker 1>some of you are probably like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1189
01:03:45.571 --> 01:03:47.450
<v Speaker 1>You have a few drinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like ha,</v>

1190
01:03:48.810 --> 01:03:51.270
<v Speaker 1>that's how we do it in Alberta anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1191
01:03:52.410 --> 01:03:55.140
<v Speaker 1>so part of that's killing the incentive </v>
<v Speaker 1>reward system.</v>

1192
01:03:55.141 --> 01:03:59.220
<v Speaker 1>And because it's an approach system and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's being cued by the alcohol,</v>

1193
01:03:59.221 --> 01:04:00.054
<v Speaker 1>you just continue to hit it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the dopamine kicks only occur as </v>

1194
01:04:04.981 --> 01:04:09.180
<v Speaker 1>your blood alcohol level is rising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to keep nailing it,</v>

1195
01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:12.450
<v Speaker 1>nailing yourself with alcohol because </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise your blood alcohol level won't</v>

1196
01:04:12.451 --> 01:04:13.284
<v Speaker 1>keep rising and you won't get that nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>enthusiasm and assertiveness that goes </v>

1197
01:04:16.801 --> 01:04:19.950
<v Speaker 1>along with the positive element of </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol.</v>

1198
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:24.480
<v Speaker 1>Neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the neuroticism dimension.</v>

1199
01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:25.793
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this gender difference in </v>

1200
01:04:27.991 --> 01:04:28.824
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women are about half a standard </v>

1201
01:04:30.811 --> 01:04:33.630
<v Speaker 1>deviation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher negative emotion than men.</v>

1202
01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:36.810
<v Speaker 1>It's seems like a cross cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>universal,</v>

1203
01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:37.973
<v Speaker 1>the differences more enhanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he galitary and states like </v>

1204
01:04:40.171 --> 01:04:41.004
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly the opposite of what </v>

1205
01:04:43.261 --> 01:04:44.190
<v Speaker 1>you'd presume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1206
01:04:44.191 --> 01:04:46.170
<v Speaker 1>If you were say us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1207
01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:47.490
<v Speaker 1>a radical,</v>

1208
01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:50.513
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you are someone who believes that </v>

1209
01:04:52.141 --> 01:04:54.540
<v Speaker 1>everything occurs as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialization,</v>

1210
01:04:54.810 --> 01:04:55.643
<v Speaker 1>as you equalize the society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gender differences in personality </v>

1211
01:04:58.771 --> 01:05:01.290
<v Speaker 1>become larger rather than smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1212
01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:02.153
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1213
01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:04.410
<v Speaker 1>not what anybody expected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's what happened.</v>

1214
01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:08.760
<v Speaker 1>So boys and girls seem to have about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same level of negative emotion.</v>

1215
01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:09.773
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as puberty hits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women become higher negative emotion </v>

1216
01:05:12.241 --> 01:05:13.074
<v Speaker 1>than men on average.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's still a lot of overlap between </v>

1217
01:05:14.971 --> 01:05:19.900
<v Speaker 1>the genders and it never goes away again</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the life course once it kicks in,</v>

1218
01:05:19.901 --> 01:05:21.760
<v Speaker 1>in puberty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reasons for that,</v>

1219
01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:23.920
<v Speaker 1>women are smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1220
01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:26.650
<v Speaker 1>their upper bodies are weaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're more physical,</v>

1221
01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:28.630
<v Speaker 1>they're there at a physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>disadvantage.</v>

1222
01:05:28.631 --> 01:05:31.810
<v Speaker 1>If they're in a dominance dispute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're sexually vulnerable,</v>

1223
01:05:32.110 --> 01:05:32.943
<v Speaker 1>plus they have to take care of infants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think those four things are </v>

1224
01:05:35.741 --> 01:05:36.574
<v Speaker 1>probably enough to tilt the nervous </v>
<v Speaker 1>system of women more towards negative </v>

1225
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:41.463
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion.</v>

1226
01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:43.740
<v Speaker 1>I've often thought maybe that women's </v>
<v Speaker 1>name,</v>

1227
01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:44.883
<v Speaker 1>emotional systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the negative ones in particular are </v>

1228
01:05:46.691 --> 01:05:47.524
<v Speaker 1>actually not tuned to the woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are tuned to the woman </v>

1229
01:05:51.101 --> 01:05:54.110
<v Speaker 1>infant combination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1230
01:05:54.370 --> 01:05:57.040
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it from an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it for bit,</v>

1231
01:05:57.050 --> 01:06:01.840
<v Speaker 1>it almost has to be that way because an </v>
<v Speaker 1>infant has to be carried around for like</v>

1232
01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:02.673
<v Speaker 1>a year and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so at that point when you have an </v>

1233
01:06:04.631 --> 01:06:08.200
<v Speaker 1>infant and maybe you're going to have 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you guys won't,</v>

1234
01:06:08.201 --> 01:06:10.330
<v Speaker 1>but in the evolutionary past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would have been the case.</v>

1235
01:06:10.331 --> 01:06:13.810
<v Speaker 1>You'd have an infant for a bunch of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life and then you'd be a grandmother and</v>

1236
01:06:13.811 --> 01:06:15.280
<v Speaker 1>have an incident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1237
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:16.833
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't your nervous system be </v>
<v Speaker 1>tuned at puberty for the two of you </v>

1238
01:06:19.721 --> 01:06:23.860
<v Speaker 1>instead of one of you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how could it be any other way?</v>

1239
01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:29.220
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1240
01:06:30.731 --> 01:06:32.380
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you one more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What time is it?</v>

1241
01:06:32.410 --> 01:06:35.350
<v Speaker 1>This clock says one 46 is that vaguely </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct?</v>

1242
01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:37.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful.</v>

1243
01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:38.673
<v Speaker 1>One 48 five okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I'm going to run you through a </v>

1244
01:06:41.861 --> 01:06:43.030
<v Speaker 1>problem that took me</v>

1245
01:06:43.370 --> 01:06:44.203
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

1246
01:06:46.090 --> 01:06:46.631
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1247
01:06:46.631 --> 01:06:50.160
<v Speaker 1>Two 48 ts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's see.</v>

1248
01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:52.433
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>

1249
01:06:56.110 --> 01:06:57.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two things.</v>

1250
01:06:57.610 --> 01:06:58.443
<v Speaker 1>So you've got your hypothalamus and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>on top of that you've got some circuits </v>

1251
01:07:01.421 --> 01:07:02.254
<v Speaker 1>that deal with memory and emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to run you through the </v>

1252
01:07:04.031 --> 01:07:06.250
<v Speaker 1>hippocampus and the Amygdala relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>

1253
01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:07.413
<v Speaker 1>So this is a theory that was basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>put together by socal [inaudible] who's </v>

1254
01:07:10.291 --> 01:07:11.124
<v Speaker 1>a Russian neuropsychologist back in 1962</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a variant of a theory that </v>

1255
01:07:14.081 --> 01:07:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Norbert Wiener developed back in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>forties so here's the idea.</v>

1256
01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:22.960
<v Speaker 1>You wander through the world and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a place that you know,</v>

1257
01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:25.320
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1258
01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:29.320
<v Speaker 1>your memory systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hit the campus,</v>

1259
01:07:29.321 --> 01:07:30.154
<v Speaker 1>looks inside your memory systems to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is that you want to have happen </v>

1260
01:07:35.350 --> 01:07:37.450
<v Speaker 1>based on your understanding of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1261
01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1262
01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:41.613
<v Speaker 1>you're in a motivated state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have certain expectations that </v>

1263
01:07:43.991 --> 01:07:44.824
<v Speaker 1>makes sense within that state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the hippocampus is watching what you </v>

1264
01:07:47.411 --> 01:07:50.050
<v Speaker 1>think is going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But remember that's motivated.</v>

1265
01:07:50.051 --> 01:07:54.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not just expectation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the hippocampus is also looking</v>

1266
01:07:54.341 --> 01:07:59.341
<v Speaker 1>at the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's looking at an interpretation of</v>

1267
01:08:00.371 --> 01:08:03.460
<v Speaker 1>the world because you can't help but </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpret the world.</v>

1268
01:08:03.610 --> 01:08:07.180
<v Speaker 1>But fundamentally the hippocampus is </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking inside you and outside you.</v>

1269
01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:08.673
<v Speaker 1>And then it seeing if what's happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside and what's happening outside are </v>

1270
01:08:12.281 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 1>the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means you know what you're doing</v>

1271
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:18.560
<v Speaker 1>and you know where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they're the same.</v>

1272
01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:19.423
<v Speaker 1>So if it detects a match,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the hippocampus inhibits the </v>

1273
01:08:22.581 --> 01:08:26.390
<v Speaker 1>Amygdala and the hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

1274
01:08:26.391 --> 01:08:27.224
<v Speaker 1>Now what did it actually seems to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a little circuit in your brain </v>

1275
01:08:29.841 --> 01:08:31.670
<v Speaker 1>stem called the reticular activating </v>
<v Speaker 1>circuit,</v>

1276
01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:33.860
<v Speaker 1>and it's the thing that turns your brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>on at night.</v>

1277
01:08:33.861 --> 01:08:36.470
<v Speaker 1>If you're sleeping and you hear a noise </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you shouldn't hear,</v>

1278
01:08:36.471 --> 01:08:37.790
<v Speaker 1>it's like bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're awake.</v>

1279
01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:40.640
<v Speaker 1>It's the reticular activating system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way Down in your brainstem,</v>

1280
01:08:41.570 --> 01:08:45.350
<v Speaker 1>puts your cortex into a high arousal </v>
<v Speaker 1>state and Poof,</v>

1281
01:08:45.351 --> 01:08:46.184
<v Speaker 1>you're conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the hippocampus tells the reticular </v>

1282
01:08:49.731 --> 01:08:53.210
<v Speaker 1>activating system to basically remain </v>
<v Speaker 1>calm as well,</v>

1283
01:08:53.211 --> 01:08:54.044
<v Speaker 1>as long as what you're expecting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>desiring and what's happening are the </v>

1284
01:08:58.941 --> 01:09:01.100
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of like it's saying,</v>

1285
01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:03.750
<v Speaker 1>I know you could jump up and freak out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and run about,</v>

1286
01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:07.070
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have to right now because </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's going according to plan.</v>

1287
01:09:07.670 --> 01:09:10.520
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as there's a deviation </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an normally say,</v>

1288
01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:12.500
<v Speaker 1>then the hippocampus says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1289
01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:13.753
<v Speaker 1>something's wrong here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the it does inhibits the reticular </v>

1290
01:09:16.821 --> 01:09:19.430
<v Speaker 1>activating system that turns on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions,</v>

1291
01:09:19.431 --> 01:09:20.264
<v Speaker 1>especially your negative emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it primes your positive emotion and </v>

1292
01:09:22.971 --> 01:09:25.850
<v Speaker 1>it prime some of the hypothalamic </v>
<v Speaker 1>circuits to or disinhibiting them.</v>

1293
01:09:25.851 --> 01:09:26.684
<v Speaker 1>Because one way of solving the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>something isn't going well is to switch </v>

1294
01:09:30.651 --> 01:09:31.484
<v Speaker 1>to something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of like it's a bunch of </v>

1295
01:09:34.371 --> 01:09:35.204
<v Speaker 1>circuits on underneath you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're being held back like race </v>

1296
01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:39.073
<v Speaker 1>horses in race horse and then something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't expect happens in the </v>

1297
01:09:43.371 --> 01:09:45.710
<v Speaker 1>gates come up a little bit because then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're prepared.</v>

1298
01:09:45.711 --> 01:09:47.600
<v Speaker 1>Now a lot of that's negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1299
01:09:47.601 --> 01:09:49.550
<v Speaker 1>you don't know where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of,</v>

1300
01:09:49.670 --> 01:09:50.503
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the rest of it is be prepared </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do whatever the hell you might need </v>

1301
01:09:52.671 --> 01:09:53.504
<v Speaker 1>to do next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so normally the hippocampus detects </v>

1302
01:09:57.561 --> 01:09:59.600
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>normally that's something unexpected.</v>

1303
01:09:59.810 --> 01:10:03.380
<v Speaker 1>And then it disinhibiting your lower </v>
<v Speaker 1>circuitry and it gets you ready to go.</v>

1304
01:10:04.010 --> 01:10:09.010
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem is</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one.</v>

1305
01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:15.870
<v Speaker 1>How?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How worried should you be when something</v>

1306
01:10:16.011 --> 01:10:17.300
<v Speaker 1>that you don't expect happens?</v>

1307
01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:19.593
<v Speaker 1>An answer to that is you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big problem with life because </v>

1308
01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:25.900
<v Speaker 1>now something went wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the possibilities.</v>

1309
01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:27.940
<v Speaker 1>You're not looking at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1310
01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:30.340
<v Speaker 1>So it's actually a perceptual problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1311
01:10:31.890 --> 01:10:32.890
<v Speaker 1>Gray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1312
01:10:32.891 --> 01:10:33.724
<v Speaker 1>believes that you just see the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like it is cause he's sort of a </v>

1313
01:10:35.681 --> 01:10:37.330
<v Speaker 1>behaviorist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's full of stimuli.</v>

1314
01:10:37.331 --> 01:10:39.220
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to interpret them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's wrong.</v>

1315
01:10:39.221 --> 01:10:41.530
<v Speaker 1>You have to interpret them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if something goes wrong,</v>

1316
01:10:41.531 --> 01:10:43.480
<v Speaker 1>it might be that you're looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>things wrong.</v>

1317
01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:46.240
<v Speaker 1>Your perceptual systems are out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unlikely.</v>

1318
01:10:46.241 --> 01:10:49.600
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But forget that.</v>

1319
01:10:49.601 --> 01:10:50.434
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that you're looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world correctly and you know your </v>

1320
01:10:53.111 --> 01:10:57.520
<v Speaker 1>inferences about what went wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what went wrong isn't the consequence of</v>

1321
01:10:57.521 --> 01:10:58.354
<v Speaker 1>you misperceiving it's a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>some stupid problem with your stupid </v>

1322
01:11:02.921 --> 01:11:03.754
<v Speaker 1>plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is you don't know where the </v>

1323
01:11:05.711 --> 01:11:10.711
<v Speaker 1>error is located and that's why I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's temperament.</v>

1324
01:11:12.370 --> 01:11:16.350
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes something unexpected happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should really freak out.</v>

1325
01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:17.813
<v Speaker 1>Other times you should ignore it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't tell which of those is </v>

1326
01:11:20.311 --> 01:11:21.144
<v Speaker 1>true right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is there's a </v>

1327
01:11:22.441 --> 01:11:24.720
<v Speaker 1>distribution with a little thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

1328
01:11:24.721 --> 01:11:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Some people really get upset about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and other people hardly care at all.</v>

1329
01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:31.440
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes the people who get really </v>
<v Speaker 1>upset about it or write,</v>

1330
01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:33.960
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes the people who don't care </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all are right.</v>

1331
01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:36.510
<v Speaker 1>And that's why there's variability in </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism.</v>

1332
01:11:37.950 --> 01:11:38.783
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what you do when you were exploring </v>

1333
01:11:40.651 --> 01:11:42.960
<v Speaker 1>is you start to decompose your plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1334
01:11:42.990 --> 01:11:43.651
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

1335
01:11:43.651 --> 01:11:44.484
<v Speaker 1>if you can manage it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not so like grip by anxiety </v>

1336
01:11:46.951 --> 01:11:47.784
<v Speaker 1>that you're paralyzed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you go into your plan and you </v>

1337
01:11:49.411 --> 01:11:50.100
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1338
01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:53.970
<v Speaker 1>am I a complete like loser or is it some</v>
<v Speaker 1>micro thing that's gone wrong?</v>

1339
01:11:53.971 --> 01:11:56.750
<v Speaker 1>And then you can start to decompose it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and reconstruct your plat.</v>

1340
01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:58.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1341
01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:04.753
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1342
01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:06.413
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was something else I want to tell </v>

1343
01:12:06.801 --> 01:12:11.801
<v Speaker 1>you about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1344
01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:16.610
<v Speaker 1>The other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that this little diagram</v>

1345
01:12:16.611 --> 01:12:17.960
<v Speaker 1>helps you understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1346
01:12:17.961 --> 01:12:20.600
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is when you're laying out a</v>

1347
01:12:20.601 --> 01:12:21.980
<v Speaker 1>plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a motivated plan,</v>

1348
01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:23.480
<v Speaker 1>and a hole appears in it,</v>

1349
01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:26.640
<v Speaker 1>you have to figure out why you fell in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hole.</v>

1350
01:12:26.641 --> 01:12:27.474
<v Speaker 1>And then what you have to do is you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take that motivated plan that's kind </v>

1351
01:12:30.001 --> 01:12:33.480
<v Speaker 1>of running on automatic and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember what it's made out of.</v>

1352
01:12:34.170 --> 01:12:36.040
<v Speaker 1>And so what opens up underneath you </v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

1353
01:12:36.041 --> 01:12:39.150
<v Speaker 1>when you've made a mistake is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity of the plant.</v>

1354
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:40.343
<v Speaker 1>And then also potentially the complexity</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world on the off chance that you </v>

1355
01:12:43.341 --> 01:12:44.430
<v Speaker 1>misperceived it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1356
01:12:44.431 --> 01:12:45.750
<v Speaker 1>You're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone might say,</v>

1357
01:12:45.870 --> 01:12:48.600
<v Speaker 1>you're not understanding me properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1358
01:12:48.601 --> 01:12:51.300
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's something wrong with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interfering with the perception.</v>

1359
01:12:51.630 --> 01:12:52.463
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to do this massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>search to try to figure out where there </v>

1360
01:12:54.771 --> 01:12:56.220
<v Speaker 1>are lies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1361
01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:57.623
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason I believe that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>stick to their beliefs so hard is </v>

1362
01:13:00.661 --> 01:13:01.494
<v Speaker 1>because people don't like it when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hole appears in one of their big </v>

1363
01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:06.270
<v Speaker 1>abstractions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1364
01:13:06.271 --> 01:13:07.104
<v Speaker 1>So they've got these high order </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations of the world that are </v>

1365
01:13:09.391 --> 01:13:11.430
<v Speaker 1>shorthand ways of representing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1366
01:13:11.570 --> 01:13:14.700
<v Speaker 1>They're sort of like axioms of faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they,</v>

1367
01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:17.160
<v Speaker 1>if a hole appears in one of the axioms </v>
<v Speaker 1>of faith,</v>

1368
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:20.970
<v Speaker 1>then all this complexity comes rushing </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and it's overwhelming.</v>

1369
01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:26.060
<v Speaker 1>And so people hate it when you undermine</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of their high order abstractions.</v>

1370
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.420
<v Speaker 1>And so I think I told you this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do that in relationships,</v>

1371
01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:31.463
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's best not to do it to yourself as </v>

1372
01:13:32.341 --> 01:13:34.140
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1373
01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:45.940
<v Speaker 1>I'll start with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are Medusa's and what,</v>

1374
01:13:45.941 --> 01:13:49.040
<v Speaker 1>what happens when you see the Medusa?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1375
01:13:49.041 --> 01:13:49.470
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1376
01:13:49.470 --> 01:13:54.230
<v Speaker 1>what might that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You bet it's a,</v>

1377
01:13:54.330 --> 01:13:57.390
<v Speaker 1>it's a prey response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a sort of,</v>

1378
01:13:58.050 --> 01:14:00.030
<v Speaker 1>that's the sort of thing that occurs </v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

1379
01:14:00.970 --> 01:14:01.670
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1380
01:14:01.670 --> 01:14:05.840
<v Speaker 1>you're moving towards your goal in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>frame and the bottom drops out.</v>

1381
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:06.501
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1382
01:14:06.501 --> 01:14:09.440
<v Speaker 1>what's there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>

1383
01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:12.430
<v Speaker 1>So what's the logical first response?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1384
01:14:12.431 --> 01:14:14.110
<v Speaker 1>if you're high in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be this,</v>

1385
01:14:14.410 --> 01:14:15.243
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freeze.</v>

1386
01:14:15.730 --> 01:14:17.740
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and only then,</v>

1387
01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:19.053
<v Speaker 1>if nothing else terrible happens to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll start to relax a bit and then </v>

1388
01:14:21.850 --> 01:14:24.220
<v Speaker 1>maybe you'll start to investigate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of your planet.</v>

1389
01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.590
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you'll start to investigate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of the world.</v>

1390
01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:29.350
<v Speaker 1>And then from a constructivist </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

1391
01:14:29.351 --> 01:14:33.130
<v Speaker 1>say once you start to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gather information from the world,</v>

1392
01:14:33.131 --> 01:14:36.370
<v Speaker 1>and then you remake your plan and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>remake your conception of the world,</v>

1393
01:14:36.371 --> 01:14:40.270
<v Speaker 1>and then you could move on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you do that under the guidance of the</v>

1394
01:14:40.271 --> 01:14:42.730
<v Speaker 1>positive and the negative emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1395
01:14:42.970 --> 01:14:45.730
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see you Tuesday.</v>
