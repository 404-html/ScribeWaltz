1
00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Couple of announcements first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.790
<v Speaker 1>it looked like the personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>assessment program got overloaded on the</v>

3
00:00:08.791 --> 00:00:09.624
<v Speaker 1>due date.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I presume that was because a large </v>

4
00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:15.570
<v Speaker 1>number of people in the class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing it in the last two hours.</v>

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.200
<v Speaker 1>So I've recalibrated the due dates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The earliest due date is a week from the</v>

6
00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:22.314
<v Speaker 1>previous due date,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is the 23rd and then I've </v>

7
00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:26.514
<v Speaker 1>divided it up by your last name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you should've got an email from me </v>

8
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.283
<v Speaker 1>telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling you when the personality </v>

9
00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:38.481
<v Speaker 1>assessment is in fact dupe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those of you from a to h or something</v>

10
00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:40.470
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to hand it in first,</v>

11
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:43.200
<v Speaker 1>but you still had an extra week so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be too bad.</v>

12
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.040
<v Speaker 1>There's also no class on Thursday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to be out of town.</v>

13
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.270
<v Speaker 1>So that's the announcements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

14
00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:56.271
<v Speaker 1>So today we're going to talk about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality trait,</v>

15
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.373
<v Speaker 1>which is agreeableness and one end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the distribution and something called </v>

16
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.630
<v Speaker 1>sometimes called antagonism on the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>

17
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.133
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

18
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.013
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a difficult trait to conceptualize </v>

19
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.613
<v Speaker 1>in my estimation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always been the one that's puzzled </v>

20
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:15.834
<v Speaker 1>me the most in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I also think it's the one that gets </v>

21
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.560
<v Speaker 1>most obviously troublesome at both ends </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the spectrum.</v>

22
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.293
<v Speaker 1>So extremely agreeable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are empathetic and Compassionate </v>

23
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.673
<v Speaker 1>and compliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the downside of that is that they </v>

24
00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:41.700
<v Speaker 1>are not that good at standing up for </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and their,</v>

25
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.280
<v Speaker 1>and so they're often manipulated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushed around.</v>

26
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

27
00:01:46.171 --> 00:01:49.530
<v Speaker 1>they're not as good at negotiating for </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own salaries.</v>

28
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.740
<v Speaker 1>And that's something we'll discuss in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

29
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.710
<v Speaker 1>And my experience clinically as being </v>
<v Speaker 1>that agreeable people,</v>

30
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.083
<v Speaker 1>the consequence of their compliance is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they tend to be resentful because </v>

31
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.003
<v Speaker 1>just because you're agreeable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>compliant doesn't mean that at some </v>

32
00:02:06.031 --> 00:02:10.260
<v Speaker 1>level of your psyche you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in a fair deal.</v>

33
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.040
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not particularly good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiating for yourself,</v>

34
00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:17.910
<v Speaker 1>especially in the presence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable or antagonistic people,</v>

35
00:02:17.911 --> 00:02:22.140
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to be left with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>short end of the stick.</v>

36
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.300
<v Speaker 1>I think the typical complaint of someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's very agreeable is I do so much for</v>

37
00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:29.940
<v Speaker 1>other people and they seem to do so </v>
<v Speaker 1>little for me.</v>

38
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.920
<v Speaker 1>And so if you feel that way,</v>

39
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.333
<v Speaker 2>mmm,</v>

40
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.010
<v Speaker 1>there's a reasonable probability that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're agreeable,</v>

41
00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:37.844
<v Speaker 1>there's some probability that you're too</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeable and maybe you should stop </v>

42
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:43.663
<v Speaker 1>being so easy to get along with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's one possibility on the other </v>

43
00:02:46.641 --> 00:02:49.040
<v Speaker 1>end of the distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the antagonistic end,</v>

44
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.730
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're antagonistic enough,</v>

45
00:02:52.731 --> 00:02:53.564
<v Speaker 1>he ended up in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the best personality predictor of </v>

46
00:02:57.231 --> 00:02:58.064
<v Speaker 1>antisocial behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be associated with sorta </v>

47
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 1>cold blooded aggression rather than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reactive form,</v>

48
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 1>which would be more characteristic of </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion neuroticism.</v>

49
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.950
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that people who are lower in</v>

50
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:12.700
<v Speaker 1>agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>denser,</v>

51
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.240
<v Speaker 1>higher antagonism are probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory.</v>

52
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.191
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:19.024
<v Speaker 1>human beings are predators and we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been for a huge swatch of our </v>

54
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.250
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe for all of it,</v>

55
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not when we were one cell down and</v>

56
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for a huge,</v>

57
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.080
<v Speaker 1>a huge chunk of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And during that time,</v>

58
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.980
<v Speaker 1>our capacity to be predators is </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely been key to our survival.</v>

59
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:46.503
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we perhaps started to cook 2 million </v>

60
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:52.870
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very peculiar human activity,</v>

61
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.183
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the use of fire and cooking and there's </v>

62
00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:57.520
<v Speaker 1>no other animals that do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

63
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.440
<v Speaker 1>it made me much more digestible for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shortened the length of our digestive</v>

64
00:04:02.441 --> 00:04:03.274
<v Speaker 1>system a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at human beings compared </v>

65
00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:07.480
<v Speaker 1>to chimpanzees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how to chimpanzee has shaped a,</v>

66
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:08.643
<v Speaker 1>they're sort of shaped like this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because a chimpanzee is mostly in </v>

67
00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:12.604
<v Speaker 1>test dines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because they </v>

68
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:15.454
<v Speaker 1>mostly leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do hunt though they will catch </v>

69
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:18.580
<v Speaker 1>monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they mostly leaves.</v>

70
00:04:18.581 --> 00:04:19.414
<v Speaker 1>And so most of what a chimpanzees life </v>
<v Speaker 1>consists of is sitting around chewing </v>

71
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:27.310
<v Speaker 1>leaves and then digesting them because </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaves are not particularly nutritious.</v>

72
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.473
<v Speaker 1>Whereas human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we figured out how to hunt very </v>

73
00:04:30.401 --> 00:04:31.234
<v Speaker 1>effectively and then we figured out how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to use fire and fire makes almost </v>

74
00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:38.510
<v Speaker 1>everything more digestible and increases</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ph,</v>

75
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.693
<v Speaker 1>the caloric efficiency of the food and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it in it in particular it meat makes </v>

76
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:45.490
<v Speaker 1>meat more digestible.</v>

77
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.323
<v Speaker 1>And so that meant that we could decrease</v>
<v Speaker 1>the length of our gut and increase the </v>

78
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:52.510
<v Speaker 1>length of our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the size of our brain,</v>

79
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.120
<v Speaker 1>which seems like a pretty good trade off</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>

80
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.270
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

81
00:04:58.271 --> 00:05:01.780
<v Speaker 1>before we can talk about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go over something perhaps I</v>

82
00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:05.440
<v Speaker 1>should have gone over before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a bit of elementary statistics.</v>

83
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not so elementary because people</v>

84
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.663
<v Speaker 1>dispute them continually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want to talk to you about the </v>

85
00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:15.430
<v Speaker 1>normal distribution because you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to run into this in,</v>

86
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:16.783
<v Speaker 1>in it pretty much in every science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but particularly in psychology because </v>

87
00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:20.494
<v Speaker 1>most psychologists will tell you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>most things in the world are normally </v>

88
00:05:23.711 --> 00:05:27.280
<v Speaker 1>distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it's not exactly obvious why that</v>

89
00:05:27.281 --> 00:05:28.114
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all so not obvious by the way that </v>

90
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.253
<v Speaker 1>that it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are lots of things that aren't </v>

91
00:05:32.441 --> 00:05:35.890
<v Speaker 1>normally distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Money is not normally distributed.</v>

92
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.680
<v Speaker 1>Productivity at work is not normally </v>
<v Speaker 1>distributed.</v>

93
00:05:38.681 --> 00:05:41.710
<v Speaker 1>The number of books people publish is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not normally distributed,</v>

94
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.873
<v Speaker 1>nor is the number of records people </v>
<v Speaker 1>record or the songs that they write or </v>

95
00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:46.204
<v Speaker 1>the paintings that they make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Virtually anything that has to do with </v>

96
00:05:48.761 --> 00:05:51.820
<v Speaker 1>productivity is distributed in a prieto </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>

97
00:05:51.821 --> 00:05:53.920
<v Speaker 1>which we'll talk about more towards the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end of the class.</v>

98
00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:58.730
<v Speaker 1>And a premio distribution is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution where most people,</v>

99
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.590
<v Speaker 1>at least in the human case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where most people have or do very little</v>

100
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:05.780
<v Speaker 1>of the productive work in a very small </v>
<v Speaker 1>minority,</v>

101
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:08.150
<v Speaker 1>do virtually all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

102
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:09.523
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a vicious distribution and it's </v>

103
00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:12.044
<v Speaker 1>much more common than you'd think if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>went through the average psychology </v>

104
00:06:16.431 --> 00:06:17.264
<v Speaker 1>training program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really learn about premio </v>

105
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:19.064
<v Speaker 1>distributions till about 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it was because I had a client </v>

106
00:06:22.401 --> 00:06:26.120
<v Speaker 1>who was a financier and a and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist at the same time.</v>

107
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.490
<v Speaker 1>And he taught me a lot of things that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know,</v>

108
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:30.830
<v Speaker 1>which was quite convenient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

109
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:32.683
<v Speaker 1>back to the normal distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychologists will tell you that things </v>

110
00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:36.344
<v Speaker 1>are normally distributed and almost all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the statistics that you will encounter </v>

111
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:40.723
<v Speaker 1>are predicated on the assumption that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the data that you're manipulating is </v>

112
00:06:44.361 --> 00:06:45.194
<v Speaker 1>normally distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're supposed to check that </v>

113
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:49.010
<v Speaker 1>assumption before you engage in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>statistics.</v>

114
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.440
<v Speaker 1>And if the data isn't normally </v>
<v Speaker 1>distributed,</v>

115
00:06:51.441 --> 00:06:54.080
<v Speaker 1>there's various things you can do to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

116
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:59.140
<v Speaker 1>too deep to make an approximate a normal</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution before you do the analysis.</v>

117
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:00.283
<v Speaker 1>Although sometimes you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think real conceptual and empirical </v>

118
00:07:05.331 --> 00:07:08.330
<v Speaker 1>damage to the data by forcing it into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal distribution,</v>

119
00:07:08.331 --> 00:07:09.164
<v Speaker 1>especially when it's one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that actually isn't normally </v>

120
00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:12.164
<v Speaker 1>distributed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which aren't theoretically aren't </v>

121
00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:15.650
<v Speaker 1>supposed to exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but which do.</v>

122
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Now this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me show you some,</v>

123
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.820
<v Speaker 1>some something about a normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution and this is,</v>

124
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.290
<v Speaker 1>this is a golden board.</v>

125
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:25.123
<v Speaker 1>That's what this thing is called and </v>
<v Speaker 1>golden was this incredibly intelligent </v>

126
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:30.403
<v Speaker 1>polymath from the late Victorian Times </v>
<v Speaker 1>who made contributions in a whole </v>

127
00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:38.300
<v Speaker 1>variety of scientific disciplines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychometrics being one of them.</v>

128
00:07:38.301 --> 00:07:39.134
<v Speaker 1>The measurement of human behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a golden is often regarded as the first </v>

129
00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:46.760
<v Speaker 1>person who studied intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not true.</v>

130
00:07:46.761 --> 00:07:47.594
<v Speaker 1>Actually gotten studied what he called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Eminence and Eminence was sort of the </v>

131
00:07:52.641 --> 00:07:57.230
<v Speaker 1>probability that you'd be in the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>class structure,</v>

132
00:07:57.231 --> 00:07:58.064
<v Speaker 1>say as an aristocratic Englishman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he thought of that as an inborn </v>

133
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.610
<v Speaker 1>trait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

134
00:08:04.611 --> 00:08:09.170
<v Speaker 1>which made the British aristocrat </v>
<v Speaker 1>superior to the British commoner.</v>

135
00:08:09.171 --> 00:08:12.320
<v Speaker 1>And then of course superior to everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else as well.</v>

136
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.780
<v Speaker 1>And people confuse that with </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

137
00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:18.050
<v Speaker 1>But if you read golden carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find out that he really,</v>

138
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:23.260
<v Speaker 1>he didn't conceive of intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was more like talent or ability while</v>

139
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:25.820
<v Speaker 1>or eminence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what he called it.</v>

140
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:30.050
<v Speaker 1>So now golden was interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>measuring things.</v>

141
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:32.510
<v Speaker 1>And so he made a lot of measurements of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

142
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.780
<v Speaker 1>various aspects of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical aspects,</v>

143
00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:36.614
<v Speaker 1>and he started to develop some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions that we use in our </v>

144
00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:41.474
<v Speaker 1>statistics today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things he noticed was </v>

145
00:08:43.101 --> 00:08:45.830
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of things that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure,</v>

146
00:08:45.831 --> 00:08:46.664
<v Speaker 1>like height are normally distributed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that most people are </v>

147
00:08:49.731 --> 00:08:50.564
<v Speaker 1>average and there's a distribution </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the side so that most people are </v>

148
00:08:53.721 --> 00:08:54.554
<v Speaker 1>average.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A few people are really tall and a few </v>

149
00:08:56.311 --> 00:08:59.460
<v Speaker 1>people are really short and it's kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a continuous distribution across,</v>

150
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.750
<v Speaker 1>across that entire span.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a normal distribution.</v>

151
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:04.584
<v Speaker 1>Now the theory is that things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>normally distributed when a lot of </v>

152
00:09:07.951 --> 00:09:08.784
<v Speaker 1>different factors contribute to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can imagine in the case of </v>

153
00:09:12.121 --> 00:09:13.580
<v Speaker 1>height,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what,</v>

154
00:09:13.581 --> 00:09:16.260
<v Speaker 1>what might contribute to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

155
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.333
<v Speaker 1>prenatal conditions might be one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nutrition might be another genetic </v>

156
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.040
<v Speaker 1>heritage might be other.</v>

157
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:23.873
<v Speaker 1>Another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you could also divide into the </v>

158
00:09:25.111 --> 00:09:25.944
<v Speaker 1>genetic component you get from your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother and the genetic component that </v>

159
00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:31.780
<v Speaker 1>you get from your father posture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

160
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.800
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are a few,</v>

161
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.360
<v Speaker 1>maybe ethnicity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Dutch,</v>

162
00:09:36.361 --> 00:09:38.220
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are extremely tall.</v>

163
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.593
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a variety of factors that </v>

164
00:09:41.191 --> 00:09:45.150
<v Speaker 1>might contribute to height.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when a variety of factors contribute</v>

165
00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:45.984
<v Speaker 1>to something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it tends to be normally </v>

166
00:09:46.861 --> 00:09:48.960
<v Speaker 1>distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the hypothesis.</v>

167
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:53.220
<v Speaker 1>And so now it's because the variation is</v>
<v Speaker 1>random.</v>

168
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:57.780
<v Speaker 1>So let me show you what it means for </v>
<v Speaker 1>variation to be random.</v>

169
00:09:57.781 --> 00:09:59.300
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so golden figured this out.</v>

170
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:00.163
<v Speaker 1>Now this is a golden board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now a go when a golden board would </v>

171
00:10:01.591 --> 00:10:05.370
<v Speaker 1>normally be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be a board with nails.</v>

172
00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:06.204
<v Speaker 1>So each of those little dots there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you imagine those are nails and then it </v>

173
00:10:08.911 --> 00:10:09.744
<v Speaker 1>would be slanted a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there'd be a spout at the top </v>

174
00:10:12.061 --> 00:10:14.370
<v Speaker 1>right in the middle that would drop </v>
<v Speaker 1>marbles down.</v>

175
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:15.833
<v Speaker 1>And then at the bottom there's a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>of containers where the marbles could </v>

176
00:10:17.941 --> 00:10:18.774
<v Speaker 1>land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can see how the marbles </v>

177
00:10:21.961 --> 00:10:24.480
<v Speaker 1>distribute themself if you let them fall</v>
<v Speaker 1>randomly.</v>

178
00:10:24.481 --> 00:10:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Now this is random because at each nail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine a nail is a choice point,</v>

179
00:10:28.831 --> 00:10:31.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The marble can go right or left and it's</v>

180
00:10:31.411 --> 00:10:34.260
<v Speaker 1>entirely random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so here's what happens.</v>

181
00:10:34.261 --> 00:10:36.810
<v Speaker 1>If you run something randomly,</v>

182
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.633
<v Speaker 1>now you can see as the ball's accumulate</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the marbles accumulate that they're </v>

183
00:11:05.141 --> 00:11:05.974
<v Speaker 1>starting to be considerably more in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>center and considerably fewer out on </v>

184
00:11:09.951 --> 00:11:10.784
<v Speaker 1>that edges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the technical reason for this is </v>

185
00:11:13.221 --> 00:11:17.900
<v Speaker 1>that there's lots of ways to get to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle and hardly any ways to get to the</v>

186
00:11:17.901 --> 00:11:19.100
<v Speaker 1>edges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

187
00:11:19.101 --> 00:11:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Because if you want to go all the way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right for example,</v>

188
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:23.930
<v Speaker 1>then you'd have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

189
00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:24.993
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you wanted to go all the way to the </v>

190
00:11:27.681 --> 00:11:30.950
<v Speaker 1>right or the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then every time you hit a nail,</v>

191
00:11:30.951 --> 00:11:32.360
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to go either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

192
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.471
<v Speaker 1>So write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write,</v>

193
00:11:33.471 --> 00:11:33.951
<v Speaker 1>write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write,</v>

194
00:11:33.951 --> 00:11:34.490
<v Speaker 1>write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write,</v>

195
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:35.840
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or left,</v>

196
00:11:35.841 --> 00:11:36.351
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

197
00:11:36.351 --> 00:11:37.184
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

198
00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:39.280
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can imagine since there's only a</v>

199
00:11:39.281 --> 00:11:40.114
<v Speaker 1>0.5 probability of each of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that once you have 10 or so of those </v>

200
00:11:43.851 --> 00:11:44.684
<v Speaker 1>stack together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're going to </v>

201
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:50.990
<v Speaker 1>take that particular path is vanishingly</v>
<v Speaker 1>small where there were in the middle.</v>

202
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.320
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of different ways you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can there,</v>

203
00:11:53.321 --> 00:11:53.951
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

204
00:11:53.951 --> 00:11:54.551
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

205
00:11:54.551 --> 00:11:55.450
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left or right,</v>

206
00:11:55.451 --> 00:11:56.021
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

207
00:11:56.021 --> 00:11:57.940
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or while you get the picture.</v>

208
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.360
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's more paths to the center.</v>

209
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.553
<v Speaker 1>Then there are paths to they had just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why you get a normal </v>

210
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:10.150
<v Speaker 1>distribution and the normal distribution</v>
<v Speaker 1>does some pretty weird things.</v>

211
00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.730
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll go to this next one.</v>

212
00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:15.510
<v Speaker 1>This is another kind of golden board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

213
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:17.343
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll run the first part of it and </v>

214
00:12:18.041 --> 00:12:20.980
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that you get your typical </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal distribution.</v>

215
00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:27.380
<v Speaker 1>So you could imagine that each of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>little nails is a factor in some sense,</v>

216
00:12:27.381 --> 00:12:30.620
<v Speaker 1>a random factor determining where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>end up in the distribution.</v>

217
00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:38.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So after,</v>

218
00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:41.150
<v Speaker 1>after we fill this up and we have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal distribution,</v>

219
00:12:41.151 --> 00:12:43.700
<v Speaker 1>then you see the little yellow and black</v>
<v Speaker 1>line there.</v>

220
00:12:43.701 --> 00:12:46.490
<v Speaker 1>We're going to take that out and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>the balls are going to fall again.</v>

221
00:12:46.491 --> 00:12:47.324
<v Speaker 1>What do you think will happen when they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they go to the next level and it </v>

222
00:12:51.111 --> 00:12:54.830
<v Speaker 1>guesses?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

223
00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's one hypothesis.</v>

224
00:12:58.671 --> 00:13:00.590
<v Speaker 1>The bolts will be more likely to go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the edges.</v>

225
00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.960
<v Speaker 1>Anyone else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you guys think?</v>

226
00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Be More flattened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More flat.</v>

227
00:13:06.301 --> 00:13:08.630
<v Speaker 1>And people don't agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

228
00:13:08.631 --> 00:13:09.464
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

229
00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:11.040
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

230
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.410
<v Speaker 1>you better withdraw quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's starting to stack up here.</v>

231
00:13:13.411 --> 00:13:14.191
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

232
00:13:14.191 --> 00:13:15.210
<v Speaker 1>let's see what happens.</v>

233
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:27.203
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

234
00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:39.530
<v Speaker 1>Lo and behold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we kept running this,</v>

235
00:13:39.531 --> 00:13:41.270
<v Speaker 1>you'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd get another normal distribution.</v>

236
00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:42.643
<v Speaker 1>So it actually doesn't change it a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the normal distribution has a pretty </v>

237
00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:48.860
<v Speaker 1>robust phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

238
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:57.670
<v Speaker 1>now if you're doing basic statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go back to that for a minute.</v>

239
00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.630
<v Speaker 1>What you're really trying to do is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out</v>

240
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:06.880
<v Speaker 1>what the probability,</v>

241
00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:09.310
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

242
00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:12.340
<v Speaker 1>what the probability is that two </v>
<v Speaker 1>distributions will overlap.</v>

243
00:14:12.341 --> 00:14:13.174
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you took the distribution of </v>

244
00:14:14.981 --> 00:14:15.814
<v Speaker 1>height among women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is about five foot four on </v>

245
00:14:19.301 --> 00:14:21.810
<v Speaker 1>average.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there'd be a,</v>

246
00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.103
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a normal curve around that because </v>

247
00:14:24.251 --> 00:14:26.410
<v Speaker 1>there's some very short women and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>very tall women.</v>

248
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:27.543
<v Speaker 1>And then there'd be a normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution around men and men are on </v>

249
00:14:30.101 --> 00:14:30.934
<v Speaker 1>average five foot nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you could calculate the </v>

250
00:14:33.641 --> 00:14:38.641
<v Speaker 1>probability that those two curves were </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same by chance.</v>

251
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.790
<v Speaker 1>And that would depend to some degree on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of people in your sample.</v>

252
00:14:42.791 --> 00:14:46.210
<v Speaker 1>So to do this statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need the two normal distributions,</v>

253
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.580
<v Speaker 1>you need the number of people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sample,</v>

254
00:14:48.581 --> 00:14:49.414
<v Speaker 1>and then you need a way of calculating </v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that those two </v>

255
00:14:52.311 --> 00:14:55.370
<v Speaker 1>distributions could have been drawn from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same population.</v>

256
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:56.683
<v Speaker 1>So that's your hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically that's the null hypothesis is </v>

257
00:14:59.031 --> 00:15:02.510
<v Speaker 1>that the two samples are drawn from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same population,</v>

258
00:15:02.511 --> 00:15:03.344
<v Speaker 1>in which case there's not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>any difference between them or there's </v>

259
00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:07.550
<v Speaker 1>going to be random differences between </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

260
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:11.600
<v Speaker 1>And the cut off point is that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>to populate,</v>

261
00:15:11.601 --> 00:15:16.250
<v Speaker 1>if the two samples you draw have normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>distributions that overlap,</v>

262
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.560
<v Speaker 1>that overlap in such a limited manner </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that would only happen in one of 20</v>

263
00:15:24.141 --> 00:15:25.550
<v Speaker 1>cases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

264
00:15:25.551 --> 00:15:28.010
<v Speaker 1>So you're drawing random samples from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the population,</v>

265
00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:30.500
<v Speaker 1>then you presume that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant difference.</v>

266
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:31.633
<v Speaker 1>Now it's arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's P is less than 0.05 it's </v>

267
00:15:34.791 --> 00:15:36.770
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>

268
00:15:36.771 --> 00:15:37.604
<v Speaker 1>well why did psychologist picked P is </v>
<v Speaker 1>less than 0.05 and answer to that is </v>

269
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:42.913
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no reason except that there's </v>

270
00:15:44.811 --> 00:15:46.940
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two areas that you can make when</v>

271
00:15:46.941 --> 00:15:47.774
<v Speaker 1>you're calculating your statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One error is you find a difference when </v>

272
00:15:50.931 --> 00:15:53.810
<v Speaker 1>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when there isn't one right?</v>

273
00:15:53.811 --> 00:15:57.500
<v Speaker 1>You find a difference when there isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>one and the other is that you don't find</v>

274
00:15:57.501 --> 00:16:01.280
<v Speaker 1>a difference when there is one and those</v>
<v Speaker 1>are type one and type two errors.</v>

275
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:05.090
<v Speaker 1>And what you're trying to do is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>minimize both of them simultaneously.</v>

276
00:16:05.091 --> 00:16:10.091
<v Speaker 1>And that's that's you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't say where that's most suitable</v>

277
00:16:11.541 --> 00:16:14.200
<v Speaker 1>because by reducing one error you </v>
<v Speaker 1>increase the other.</v>

278
00:16:14.201 --> 00:16:15.034
<v Speaker 1>So psychologists had to pick some cutoff</v>
<v Speaker 1>and 0.05 seem to be as good as anything </v>

279
00:16:19.791 --> 00:16:21.680
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

280
00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:24.493
<v Speaker 1>now here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here you want to look at this because </v>

281
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:26.623
<v Speaker 1>actually you really need to get familiar</v>
<v Speaker 1>with what a normal distribution looks </v>

282
00:16:29.751 --> 00:16:34.751
<v Speaker 1>like and the ways that it's parsed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see right at the center,</v>

283
00:16:35.931 --> 00:16:39.080
<v Speaker 1>that's the mean and the median and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mode if the,</v>

284
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:42.230
<v Speaker 1>if the distribution is perfect and </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal,</v>

285
00:16:42.231 --> 00:16:44.270
<v Speaker 1>those three things are going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

286
00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:47.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the,</v>

287
00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:52.040
<v Speaker 1>the next level there you see percentage </v>
<v Speaker 1>of cases.</v>

288
00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:55.670
<v Speaker 1>So at three standard deviations below </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mean,</v>

289
00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:56.533
<v Speaker 1>there's only 0.13% of the population </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's three standard deviations below </v>

290
00:16:59.991 --> 00:17:02.720
<v Speaker 1>the mean or three standard deviations </v>
<v Speaker 1>above the mean.</v>

291
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.553
<v Speaker 1>So we could say we can think about Iq </v>
<v Speaker 1>because people are sort of cognizant of </v>

292
00:17:08.301 --> 00:17:09.134
<v Speaker 1>Iq to some degree a hundred which would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be the mean in terms of Iq is the </v>

293
00:17:12.981 --> 00:17:17.981
<v Speaker 1>average Iq of someone who's your typical</v>
<v Speaker 1>high school graduate.</v>

294
00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:19.813
<v Speaker 1>And then 115 is the Iq of your typical </v>
<v Speaker 1>state school graduate in the u s so </v>

295
00:17:25.551 --> 00:17:28.130
<v Speaker 1>there's a difference of 15 points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that corresponds.</v>

296
00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:29.870
<v Speaker 1>If you look here in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>percentages,</v>

297
00:17:29.871 --> 00:17:30.704
<v Speaker 1>which is the the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the bottom line is 50% of </v>

298
00:17:35.931 --> 00:17:40.931
<v Speaker 1>people have an Iq above 150% have an Iq </v>
<v Speaker 1>below and it's,</v>

299
00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.180
<v Speaker 1>it's because it's defined that way by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>

300
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:46.820
<v Speaker 1>And then if you go up one standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>deviation,</v>

301
00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:47.893
<v Speaker 1>you see that pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's we'll 85% for the sake of </v>

302
00:17:50.761 --> 00:17:51.594
<v Speaker 1>simplicity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>85% of people have an Iq below 115 and </v>

303
00:17:57.331 --> 00:17:59.150
<v Speaker 1>then if you go up to two standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>deviations,</v>

304
00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.840
<v Speaker 1>you see that 98% of people have an Iq.</v>

305
00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:03.240
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

306
00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:08.240
<v Speaker 1>Below two standard two standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>deviations and three standard deviations</v>

307
00:18:08.461 --> 00:18:09.294
<v Speaker 1>is 99.9 so when you get up to 130 </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only two and a half percent of </v>

308
00:18:15.331 --> 00:18:16.164
<v Speaker 1>the population has an Iq that high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's about where you guys are </v>

309
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:23.730
<v Speaker 1>somewhere between 120 and 130 so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

310
00:18:23.731 --> 00:18:24.564
<v Speaker 1>you look around and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you know this is an average class </v>

311
00:18:26.331 --> 00:18:27.164
<v Speaker 1>of university students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not average in terms of </v>

312
00:18:29.371 --> 00:18:31.950
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that makes a huge difference because</v>

313
00:18:31.951 --> 00:18:34.800
<v Speaker 1>intelligence is one of the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>predictors of career success.</v>

314
00:18:34.801 --> 00:18:35.634
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you grow up to three standard </v>

315
00:18:37.021 --> 00:18:37.854
<v Speaker 1>deviations?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an Iq of 145 you know when </v>

316
00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.780
<v Speaker 1>there's undoubtedly a couple of you in </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

317
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's,</v>

318
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.400
<v Speaker 1>it's one in a thousand in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

319
00:18:47.401 --> 00:18:48.234
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple of you in here that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have an Iq of 145 or maybe more than a </v>

320
00:18:50.761 --> 00:18:52.020
<v Speaker 1>couple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

321
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:53.003
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you want to notice is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because people get very confused about </v>

322
00:18:55.561 --> 00:18:56.940
<v Speaker 1>this with regards to percentages.</v>

323
00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:01.650
<v Speaker 1>So let's say that you were assessing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to hire them,</v>

324
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.530
<v Speaker 1>or you were assessing them for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

325
00:19:04.531 --> 00:19:06.510
<v Speaker 1>which is something that might be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

326
00:19:06.511 --> 00:19:07.344
<v Speaker 1>if you were screening them to go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>university because the sats do that in </v>

327
00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:13.860
<v Speaker 1>the u s or if you were screening them </v>
<v Speaker 1>using the graduate record exam and you,</v>

328
00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:18.890
<v Speaker 1>you'd have you at one candidate who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>98th percentile and then other candidate</v>

329
00:19:19.351 --> 00:19:21.180
<v Speaker 1>who's 99th percentile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

330
00:19:21.181 --> 00:19:25.890
<v Speaker 1>So think about that for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>98 99 where's the,</v>

331
00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.350
<v Speaker 1>where is there more difference?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have three candidates,</v>

332
00:19:28.351 --> 00:19:31.290
<v Speaker 1>one is 85th percent to all one's 98th </v>
<v Speaker 1>percentile,</v>

333
00:19:31.291 --> 00:19:36.291
<v Speaker 1>one's 99th percentile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's the biggest difference?</v>

334
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:42.470
<v Speaker 1>Is it between the 85th and 98</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

335
00:19:44.101 --> 00:19:45.990
<v Speaker 1>in terms of of improbability.</v>

336
00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:50.613
<v Speaker 1>So it's the same distance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's what you have to remember </v>

337
00:19:53.261 --> 00:19:54.094
<v Speaker 1>when you're thinking about percentiles </v>
<v Speaker 1>because 99 to 99.9% I'll don't sound </v>

338
00:19:57.461 --> 00:19:58.294
<v Speaker 1>very different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're the difference between one </v>

339
00:19:59.711 --> 00:20:02.890
<v Speaker 1>and 101 in a thousand so it's a huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal.</v>

340
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:03.993
<v Speaker 1>That's why you see that the normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution is divided up into these </v>

341
00:20:06.971 --> 00:20:07.804
<v Speaker 1>standard deviations and those are </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically identical differences and </v>

342
00:20:12.701 --> 00:20:15.250
<v Speaker 1>those are often identical differences in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of ability.</v>

343
00:20:15.251 --> 00:20:16.690
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

344
00:20:16.691 --> 00:20:20.620
<v Speaker 1>you might think that once you hit one 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>going above that isn't going to matter,</v>

345
00:20:20.621 --> 00:20:21.454
<v Speaker 1>but that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just as much difference between </v>

346
00:20:23.141 --> 00:20:28.141
<v Speaker 1>someone who has an Iq of 130 and someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who has an Iq of 145 as there is between</v>

347
00:20:28.781 --> 00:20:29.614
<v Speaker 1>someone who has an Iq of 115 and an Iq </v>
<v Speaker 1>of 130 even though the percentile start </v>

348
00:20:33.851 --> 00:20:34.684
<v Speaker 1>to switch around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need to know these sorts of </v>

349
00:20:35.981 --> 00:20:36.814
<v Speaker 1>things if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're starting to think </v>

350
00:20:38.531 --> 00:20:42.280
<v Speaker 1>statistically because otherwise while </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't understand what you're doing,</v>

351
00:20:42.281 --> 00:20:44.260
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's generally not a good thing.</v>

352
00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.340
<v Speaker 1>So although it's very frequent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

353
00:20:48.341 --> 00:20:53.170
<v Speaker 1>so agreeableness is one of the five </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions of the big five.</v>

354
00:20:53.171 --> 00:20:55.690
<v Speaker 1>We all know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it can be broken down into these two</v>

355
00:20:55.691 --> 00:20:57.640
<v Speaker 1>aspects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion and politeness.</v>

356
00:20:57.910 --> 00:20:58.743
<v Speaker 1>And so you can kind of figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeable you are by looking at these </v>

357
00:21:01.481 --> 00:21:02.314
<v Speaker 1>items.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all positively scored for the </v>

358
00:21:03.191 --> 00:21:04.024
<v Speaker 1>sake of simplicity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you intensely feel others' </v>

359
00:21:07.541 --> 00:21:08.374
<v Speaker 1>emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're always in inquiring about how </v>

360
00:21:11.321 --> 00:21:12.154
<v Speaker 1>others are doing and you actually care </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than doing it for the sake of </v>

361
00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:17.140
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

362
00:21:17.141 --> 00:21:19.870
<v Speaker 1>if you're capable of sympathizing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>

363
00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:24.550
<v Speaker 1>if you respect authority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't like to see him or be pushy</v>

364
00:21:24.551 --> 00:21:26.680
<v Speaker 1>and you don't like to impose your will </v>
<v Speaker 1>on others,</v>

365
00:21:26.681 --> 00:21:27.514
<v Speaker 1>then you're an agreeable person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a disagreeable person or </v>

366
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:33.970
<v Speaker 1>antagonistic person obviously is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite of that.</v>

367
00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:39.160
<v Speaker 1>So they're in don't feel peoples' </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions very profoundly.</v>

368
00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:44.640
<v Speaker 1>They're not really all that concerned </v>
<v Speaker 1>automatically about how other people are</v>

369
00:21:44.741 --> 00:21:47.410
<v Speaker 1>feeling and they're not that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sympathetic.</v>

370
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:50.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny cause in my clinical practice</v>

371
00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:51.483
<v Speaker 1>I can tell the difference between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeable people in the non agreeable </v>

372
00:21:53.591 --> 00:21:57.430
<v Speaker 1>people because when the agreeable people</v>
<v Speaker 1>come and they have a cup of coffee,</v>

373
00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:00.850
<v Speaker 1>they always bring me one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when the disagreeable people show up</v>

374
00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:01.713
<v Speaker 1>and have a cup of coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they only bring a cup of coffee for </v>

375
00:22:03.611 --> 00:22:06.730
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's quite comical actually.</v>

376
00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.360
<v Speaker 1>So now you might think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

377
00:22:10.361 --> 00:22:11.860
<v Speaker 1>cause our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

378
00:22:11.861 --> 00:22:15.970
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say our society is at the</v>

379
00:22:15.971 --> 00:22:16.804
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tilted towards regarding agreeableness </v>

380
00:22:18.761 --> 00:22:19.960
<v Speaker 1>as a virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

381
00:22:19.961 --> 00:22:20.794
<v Speaker 1>because you should be kind and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be empathetic and you should be </v>

382
00:22:22.481 --> 00:22:24.100
<v Speaker 1>compassionate and all those sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

383
00:22:24.101 --> 00:22:24.934
<v Speaker 1>But our research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't published yet because it's </v>

384
00:22:28.931 --> 00:22:29.764
<v Speaker 1>complicated to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to communicate and we haven't figured </v>

385
00:22:31.571 --> 00:22:32.290
<v Speaker 1>out how to do it yet.</v>

386
00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:35.230
<v Speaker 1>But what we've found is that if you push</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of the,</v>

387
00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:37.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>traits too far,</v>

388
00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:41.590
<v Speaker 1>they fall off a cliff fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you get too agreeable,</v>

389
00:22:41.591 --> 00:22:44.020
<v Speaker 1>then you're dependent and you can't make</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions and so on.</v>

390
00:22:44.021 --> 00:22:46.840
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you're kind of afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Eda pull mother too,</v>

391
00:22:46.841 --> 00:22:47.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're so,</v>

392
00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:48.870
<v Speaker 1>you're so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

393
00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.073
<v Speaker 1>concerned with your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your child's wellbeing that you </v>

394
00:22:52.331 --> 00:22:53.164
<v Speaker 1>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not harsh enough to send them </v>

395
00:22:54.461 --> 00:22:55.294
<v Speaker 1>outsider or make them do anything they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to do because it might upset </v>

396
00:22:58.421 --> 00:22:59.830
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's not so good.</v>

397
00:22:59.831 --> 00:23:03.040
<v Speaker 1>And then if you're to disagreeable while</v>
<v Speaker 1>I already said what that was like,</v>

398
00:23:03.041 --> 00:23:05.560
<v Speaker 1>if you take antisocial people who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>in prison,</v>

399
00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:06.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

400
00:23:06.701 --> 00:23:09.430
<v Speaker 1>they're aggressive and violent and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

401
00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:12.130
<v Speaker 1>the criminal types and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're predatory,</v>

402
00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.340
<v Speaker 1>are low in agreeableness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can see how that's a bad thing.</v>

403
00:23:15.341 --> 00:23:17.440
<v Speaker 1>But then in the middle range,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

404
00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:18.393
<v Speaker 1>it gets more complicated because then </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness that where you're located </v>

405
00:23:21.761 --> 00:23:23.950
<v Speaker 1>on the normal distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how good that is,</v>

406
00:23:23.951 --> 00:23:27.760
<v Speaker 1>depends to some degree on what it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you are going to do.</v>

407
00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:28.743
<v Speaker 1>So one of the ways to think about how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>maximize your success in life is to </v>

408
00:23:34.151 --> 00:23:36.790
<v Speaker 1>attempt to match your personality to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

409
00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:41.350
<v Speaker 1>And so now what we're gonna do is we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to look at how agreeableness plays</v>

410
00:23:41.351 --> 00:23:44.770
<v Speaker 1>out as far as we can tell in the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

411
00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:46.820
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

412
00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:48.320
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should tell you too,</v>

413
00:23:48.321 --> 00:23:49.154
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the sort of discussion that </v>

414
00:23:50.751 --> 00:23:51.584
<v Speaker 1>really people really don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything we're going to talk about </v>

415
00:23:53.361 --> 00:23:54.194
<v Speaker 1>pretty much from here on end rubs people</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrong way because our culture is </v>

416
00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:59.710
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

417
00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:01.003
<v Speaker 1>likely to assume that most of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences between people are cultural </v>

418
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:09.100
<v Speaker 1>in origin and almost none of the data </v>
<v Speaker 1>show that what they show is that right</v>

419
00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:14.810
<v Speaker 1>as at least as your culture becomes more</v>
<v Speaker 1>egalitarian,</v>

420
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:16.850
<v Speaker 1>which is hypothetically what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>aiming at.</v>

421
00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.480
<v Speaker 1>The differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender differences for example,</v>

422
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.553
<v Speaker 1>not only become more biological because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've eradicated all the cultural </v>

423
00:24:24.741 --> 00:24:27.470
<v Speaker 1>difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also become more pronounced.</v>

424
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:28.873
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gender differences between men and </v>

425
00:24:31.101 --> 00:24:31.934
<v Speaker 1>women are largest in the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>egalitarian societies like Norway and </v>

426
00:24:35.361 --> 00:24:36.194
<v Speaker 1>Sweden and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the theory there is that well </v>

427
00:24:38.661 --> 00:24:41.210
<v Speaker 1>once you've eradicated all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental differences,</v>

428
00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.610
<v Speaker 1>all that are left are the genetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences.</v>

429
00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:47.690
<v Speaker 1>And so that's sort of echoed in a weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>finding in families.</v>

430
00:24:47.691 --> 00:24:48.524
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think that if how you raised </v>

431
00:24:52.191 --> 00:24:54.200
<v Speaker 1>your children mattered.</v>

432
00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:55.570
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

433
00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:56.403
<v Speaker 1>And children who were raised well would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be more similar than children who were </v>

434
00:24:59.741 --> 00:25:03.700
<v Speaker 1>raised badly cause that would reflect </v>
<v Speaker 1>the effect of your parenting.</v>

435
00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:06.370
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've done a good job as a parent.</v>

436
00:25:06.371 --> 00:25:09.040
<v Speaker 1>So your children are more similar where </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who just ignored them,</v>

437
00:25:09.041 --> 00:25:12.430
<v Speaker 1>those children are different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's actually the opposite of what</v>

438
00:25:12.431 --> 00:25:16.660
<v Speaker 1>happens is that the children that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>neglected are more similar.</v>

439
00:25:16.661 --> 00:25:19.150
<v Speaker 1>And the children who are attended to </v>
<v Speaker 1>well are more different.</v>

440
00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:20.373
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that I think is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same reason that we see more pronounced </v>

441
00:25:24.611 --> 00:25:26.440
<v Speaker 1>differences in need galitary and </v>
<v Speaker 1>societies,</v>

442
00:25:26.441 --> 00:25:31.150
<v Speaker 1>which is if you care for your children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means that you make a very individual</v>

443
00:25:31.151 --> 00:25:34.780
<v Speaker 1>relationship with each of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're not necessarily using the same</v>

444
00:25:34.781 --> 00:25:38.790
<v Speaker 1>strategies for each child unless you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of them as Meta strategies.</v>

445
00:25:38.791 --> 00:25:43.030
<v Speaker 1>And like I met a strategy might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I get to know you and I get to know</v>

446
00:25:43.031 --> 00:25:43.330
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

447
00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:46.030
<v Speaker 1>And because you're different people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I react differently to you.</v>

448
00:25:46.031 --> 00:25:46.864
<v Speaker 1>And what's what constitutes my </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy of parenting would be act </v>

449
00:25:51.491 --> 00:25:54.340
<v Speaker 1>differently towards the children's </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences.</v>

450
00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:57.070
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe if you're particularly good</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that,</v>

451
00:25:57.071 --> 00:26:00.160
<v Speaker 1>your children turn out maximally </v>
<v Speaker 1>different from one another.</v>

452
00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:01.593
<v Speaker 1>And that's because you're allowing their</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic differences to manifest </v>

453
00:26:03.971 --> 00:26:05.350
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what oppressing them,</v>

454
00:26:05.351 --> 00:26:06.184
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and trying to cram them into the little </v>

455
00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:09.490
<v Speaker 1>box that you think that they should fit </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

456
00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Now the downside of that is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get differences,</v>

457
00:26:12.791 --> 00:26:13.624
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of them might be quite </v>

458
00:26:14.021 --> 00:26:15.790
<v Speaker 1>surprising to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

459
00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:20.050
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's look at some gender differences</v>

460
00:26:20.051 --> 00:26:23.950
<v Speaker 1>to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So women are half a standard deviation,</v>

461
00:26:23.951 --> 00:26:27.620
<v Speaker 1>more agreeable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we looked at the standard deviation.</v>

462
00:26:27.621 --> 00:26:29.140
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

463
00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.150
<v Speaker 1>half a standard deviation would </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent,</v>

464
00:26:35.151 --> 00:26:37.220
<v Speaker 1>let me see if I can figure it out here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

465
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.930
<v Speaker 3>50 smoke,</v>

466
00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:45.990
<v Speaker 1>34,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so 1767,</v>

467
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.260
<v Speaker 1>the average woman would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be</v>

468
00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:56.150
<v Speaker 1>less agreeable than 67% of women to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>as disagreeable as the typical mat.</v>

469
00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:00.630
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the basic size of the effect.</v>

470
00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:03.840
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

471
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.190
<v Speaker 1>the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you see,</v>

472
00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.380
<v Speaker 1>now you see how the two distributions </v>
<v Speaker 1>overlap,</v>

473
00:27:07.381 --> 00:27:08.214
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what the first thing you can see is </v>

474
00:27:10.051 --> 00:27:13.320
<v Speaker 1>that in the middle of the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>distributions,</v>

475
00:27:13.321 --> 00:27:17.280
<v Speaker 1>there's a space and that's a space </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's filled with men and women.</v>

476
00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:22.200
<v Speaker 1>So most of this space is occupied by men</v>
<v Speaker 1>and women.</v>

477
00:27:22.201 --> 00:27:25.950
<v Speaker 1>But if you look off to the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

478
00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:27.293
<v Speaker 1>the most agreeable women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most agreeable people say three </v>

479
00:27:29.671 --> 00:27:32.070
<v Speaker 1>standard deviations from the mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all women.</v>

480
00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:34.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might not be that relevant,</v>

481
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:35.543
<v Speaker 1>but if you go to the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the people who are three standard </v>

482
00:27:38.131 --> 00:27:42.720
<v Speaker 1>deviations below the mean are man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that really starts to matter.</v>

483
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:45.660
<v Speaker 1>And here's one way it matters who's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>prison.</v>

484
00:27:45.661 --> 00:27:46.494
<v Speaker 1>Most men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you don't throw anyone in prison </v>

485
00:27:49.981 --> 00:27:50.814
<v Speaker 1>unless they're like three standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>deviations below the mean in </v>

486
00:27:52.421 --> 00:27:53.254
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would put them at about one in a </v>

487
00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:55.150
<v Speaker 1>thousand.</v>

488
00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:55.983
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more people ended up in prison than </v>

489
00:27:57.181 --> 00:27:58.350
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point is,</v>

490
00:27:58.351 --> 00:27:59.184
<v Speaker 1>once you get out on that edge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the gender differences become </v>

491
00:28:02.821 --> 00:28:05.010
<v Speaker 1>absolutely staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

492
00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.200
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird thing about normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>distributions,</v>

493
00:28:07.201 --> 00:28:08.034
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have a very little mean </v>

494
00:28:08.821 --> 00:28:11.160
<v Speaker 1>difference because the mean difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>here isn't that big.</v>

495
00:28:11.161 --> 00:28:14.040
<v Speaker 1>It's only half a standard deviation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that massive.</v>

496
00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:16.980
<v Speaker 1>But as you move out towards the </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremes,</v>

497
00:28:16.981 --> 00:28:21.960
<v Speaker 1>the effects accumulate and they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>huge societal effects.</v>

498
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:23.783
<v Speaker 1>So the cl here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can't remember what that stands </v>

499
00:28:27.901 --> 00:28:28.734
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that a randomly drawn </v>

500
00:28:31.441 --> 00:28:32.274
<v Speaker 1>woman will be more agreeable than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>randomly drawn man is 63% now women are </v>

501
00:28:36.301 --> 00:28:39.120
<v Speaker 1>also higher negative emotion and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference isn't quite as big,</v>

502
00:28:39.121 --> 00:28:40.590
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's roughly comparable.</v>

503
00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:44.970
<v Speaker 1>So fundamentally the two big gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences are in agreeableness.</v>

504
00:28:44.971 --> 00:28:45.804
<v Speaker 1>So women are more compassionate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sympathetic and empathetic and less </v>

505
00:28:47.791 --> 00:28:48.750
<v Speaker 1>confrontational.</v>

506
00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:53.850
<v Speaker 1>And then negative emotion and negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion is anxiety,</v>

507
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:56.310
<v Speaker 1>emotional pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frustration,</v>

508
00:28:56.311 --> 00:28:57.144
<v Speaker 1>disappointment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all kind of clumped together into </v>

509
00:28:58.981 --> 00:29:01.560
<v Speaker 1>one</v>
<v Speaker 1>axis.</v>

510
00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:03.353
<v Speaker 1>So the agreeableness dimension</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to be stable across the lifespan </v>

511
00:29:08.871 --> 00:29:09.704
<v Speaker 1>that the gender difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's the neuroticism difference only </v>

512
00:29:11.611 --> 00:29:12.444
<v Speaker 1>seems to emerge in puberty for women and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it stays constant pretty much for </v>

513
00:29:17.341 --> 00:29:19.410
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the lifespan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

514
00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:21.023
<v Speaker 1>so this is one of the things this means </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the probability that a given </v>

515
00:29:24.991 --> 00:29:27.060
<v Speaker 1>woman is more agreeable than a given man</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

516
00:29:27.061 --> 00:29:31.260
<v Speaker 1>It is about 63% and then also in terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>of negative emotions,</v>

517
00:29:31.261 --> 00:29:33.510
<v Speaker 1>say it's approximately the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you might think,</v>

518
00:29:33.511 --> 00:29:34.344
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the probability that a given </v>

519
00:29:35.881 --> 00:29:40.470
<v Speaker 1>person will be higher negative emotion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And more agreeable.</v>

520
00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:43.810
<v Speaker 1>And then you see how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because these dimensions are orthogonal,</v>

521
00:29:43.811 --> 00:29:45.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're unrelated essentially.</v>

522
00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:47.043
<v Speaker 1>So that means you can add them together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so once you start to add the </v>

523
00:29:49.721 --> 00:29:52.300
<v Speaker 1>personality differences together between</v>
<v Speaker 1>men and women,</v>

524
00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.940
<v Speaker 1>they actually start to become come quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>

525
00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.850
<v Speaker 1>far more than half a standard deviation.</v>

526
00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:00.580
<v Speaker 1>Women are also more extroverted than </v>
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>

527
00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:01.893
<v Speaker 1>So that's funny because extroversion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extroversion is a positive emotion </v>

528
00:30:04.211 --> 00:30:05.044
<v Speaker 1>dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas neuroticism is a negative </v>

529
00:30:06.911 --> 00:30:08.710
<v Speaker 1>emotion dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

530
00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.113
<v Speaker 1>but women are more extroverted too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means they experience and display </v>

531
00:30:13.661 --> 00:30:17.500
<v Speaker 1>more positive emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to be the aspect of,</v>

532
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:22.810
<v Speaker 1>of extroversion that seems to carry most</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the gender differences,</v>

533
00:30:22.811 --> 00:30:26.590
<v Speaker 1>enthusiasm rather than assertiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so women laugh more than men,</v>

534
00:30:26.591 --> 00:30:29.020
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>

535
00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:29.800
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

536
00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:30.633
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an old cliche that women are </v>

537
00:30:31.971 --> 00:30:33.400
<v Speaker 1>emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more emotional than men,</v>

538
00:30:33.401 --> 00:30:34.234
<v Speaker 1>and that actually seems to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at negative and positive </v>

539
00:30:36.851 --> 00:30:37.684
<v Speaker 1>emotions specifically conscientiousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>also sing seems to be linked to emotion </v>

540
00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.590
<v Speaker 1>to discussed into shame and the guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's no,</v>

541
00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:46.510
<v Speaker 1>there's very little gender difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

542
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:47.463
<v Speaker 1>So it isn't like women are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional than men across all the </v>

543
00:30:49.331 --> 00:30:50.164
<v Speaker 1>emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the gender differences are larger </v>

544
00:30:53.681 --> 00:30:54.970
<v Speaker 1>and more egalitarian cultures.</v>

545
00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:55.813
<v Speaker 1>While the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is starting to become difficult to </v>

546
00:30:57.881 --> 00:31:01.660
<v Speaker 1>dispute because the size of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies is starting to become extreme.</v>

547
00:31:01.661 --> 00:31:03.850
<v Speaker 1>So this one study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Schmidt at all,</v>

548
00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:05.163
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they studied 18,000 people across 55 </v>

549
00:31:07.781 --> 00:31:08.614
<v Speaker 1>cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that starting to become a pretty </v>

550
00:31:09.791 --> 00:31:10.940
<v Speaker 1>impressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

551
00:31:10.941 --> 00:31:13.720
<v Speaker 1>a pretty impressive sample.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

552
00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.273
<v Speaker 1>UN indices of gender equality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic development were associated </v>

553
00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:21.340
<v Speaker 1>with larger gender differences in </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>

554
00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:24.280
<v Speaker 1>but not an extroversion or neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

555
00:31:24.281 --> 00:31:25.790
<v Speaker 1>so that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

556
00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:27.470
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

557
00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:28.373
<v Speaker 1>the effect of egalitarianism doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to be spread across all the gender </v>

558
00:31:31.151 --> 00:31:33.490
<v Speaker 1>differences just in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness.</v>

559
00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:36.130
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and gender predicts more powerfully than</v>

560
00:31:36.131 --> 00:31:38.180
<v Speaker 1>gender equality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the,</v>

561
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:40.750
<v Speaker 1>these are interesting studies and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

562
00:31:40.751 --> 00:31:44.170
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that the theorists in</v>

563
00:31:44.171 --> 00:31:47.020
<v Speaker 1>the humanities have really caught up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them because there's a huge,</v>

564
00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:52.450
<v Speaker 1>there's a huge stress in the humanities </v>
<v Speaker 1>and modern universities on the idea that</v>

565
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:57.040
<v Speaker 1>gender differences are cultural in </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature and can be eradicated by cultural</v>

566
00:31:57.041 --> 00:31:57.874
<v Speaker 1>transformation.</v>

567
00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.990
<v Speaker 1>But the evidence seems to suggest that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way you could eradicate them by</v>

568
00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.560
<v Speaker 1>cultural transformation would be by </v>
<v Speaker 1>working very,</v>

569
00:32:05.561 --> 00:32:08.890
<v Speaker 1>very hard against the biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>substrate.</v>

570
00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.740
<v Speaker 1>And you got to wonder if you really want</v>
<v Speaker 1>a society to do that,</v>

571
00:32:11.741 --> 00:32:13.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what kind of society do you want?</v>

572
00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:18.310
<v Speaker 1>Do you want a society where everyone is </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to be who they are,</v>

573
00:32:18.311 --> 00:32:20.620
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to be successful at that?</v>

574
00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:21.693
<v Speaker 1>Or do you want a society that does </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything it can to make people the </v>

575
00:32:24.101 --> 00:32:26.860
<v Speaker 1>same regardless of their individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

576
00:32:26.861 --> 00:32:29.350
<v Speaker 1>of the individual differences that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>intrinsic to them.</v>

577
00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:33.040
<v Speaker 1>It is by no means obvious that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want.</v>

578
00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.473
<v Speaker 1>So you'd have to do some pretty wicked </v>
<v Speaker 1>social engineering to eradicate </v>

579
00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:42.260
<v Speaker 1>differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it looks like the social engineering</v>

580
00:32:42.261 --> 00:32:45.110
<v Speaker 1>that you'd have to do would run counter </v>
<v Speaker 1>to egalitarianism.</v>

581
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:46.021
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he,</v>

582
00:32:46.021 --> 00:32:48.680
<v Speaker 1>since egalitarianism seems to heighten </v>
<v Speaker 1>the differences,</v>

583
00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:49.813
<v Speaker 1>it only makes sense that you'd have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>run counter to egalitarianism to reduce </v>

584
00:32:52.551 --> 00:32:53.810
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

585
00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:57.523
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

586
00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:01.470
<v Speaker 1>The lippa study here where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where there's an association between the</v>

587
00:33:01.471 --> 00:33:05.400
<v Speaker 1>UN indices of gender equality and gender</v>
<v Speaker 1>differences in agreeableness.</v>

588
00:33:05.401 --> 00:33:09.780
<v Speaker 1>I think that was 500,000 people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

589
00:33:09.781 --> 00:33:10.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the net has made,</v>

590
00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:12.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet has made it possible to run</v>

591
00:33:12.991 --> 00:33:13.824
<v Speaker 1>huge samples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here's some interesting things to </v>

592
00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:17.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

593
00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:23.180
<v Speaker 1>the occupational preferences between men</v>
<v Speaker 1>and women are actually a lot larger than</v>

594
00:33:23.521 --> 00:33:27.150
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the personality differences and the</v>

595
00:33:27.151 --> 00:33:30.390
<v Speaker 1>occupational differences are large and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

596
00:33:30.391 --> 00:33:34.050
<v Speaker 1>and like the gender differences in </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>

597
00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:35.123
<v Speaker 1>the occupational preference differences </v>
<v Speaker 1>increase as you move towards more </v>

598
00:33:39.721 --> 00:33:40.554
<v Speaker 1>egalitarian societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the big difference between women and </v>

599
00:33:44.881 --> 00:33:45.714
<v Speaker 1>men seems to be that women prefer </v>
<v Speaker 1>working with people and men prefer </v>

600
00:33:49.711 --> 00:33:50.544
<v Speaker 1>working with things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's an interesting way look at it </v>

601
00:33:53.101 --> 00:33:55.680
<v Speaker 1>because for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

602
00:33:55.681 --> 00:33:58.800
<v Speaker 1>if you're thinking about sexist </v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotypes,</v>

603
00:33:58.801 --> 00:34:02.230
<v Speaker 1>say up till the 1950s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a little later than that,</v>

604
00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:04.560
<v Speaker 1>maybe up to the mid sixties or so.</v>

605
00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:06.103
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea would it be in that whatever </v>

606
00:34:08.821 --> 00:34:12.180
<v Speaker 1>gender differences there were in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>occupational,</v>

607
00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:14.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

608
00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:16.860
<v Speaker 1>skill in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

609
00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:17.773
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in occupational distribution would have </v>

610
00:34:19.171 --> 00:34:21.630
<v Speaker 1>had more to do with skill that was so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

611
00:34:21.631 --> 00:34:22.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men were more skilled,</v>

612
00:34:22.711 --> 00:34:24.780
<v Speaker 1>say at engineering and women were less </v>
<v Speaker 1>skilled at it.</v>

613
00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:25.913
<v Speaker 1>But what seems to have been what seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the case is that if you look at </v>

614
00:34:28.591 --> 00:34:33.090
<v Speaker 1>the basic predictors of success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like intelligence and conscientiousness,</v>

615
00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:35.370
<v Speaker 1>there's virtually no gender differences </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

616
00:34:35.970 --> 00:34:36.803
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that seems to mean is that the </v>

617
00:34:39.181 --> 00:34:42.000
<v Speaker 1>reason that there are occupational </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences,</v>

618
00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:46.380
<v Speaker 1>at least in egalitarian societies is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the occupational differences are</v>

619
00:34:46.381 --> 00:34:48.780
<v Speaker 1>driven by choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not by ability.</v>

620
00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Now that's something to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

621
00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:53.100
<v Speaker 1>because again,</v>

622
00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:55.703
<v Speaker 1>that seems to indicate that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to push hard against gender </v>

623
00:34:58.411 --> 00:34:59.244
<v Speaker 1>preferences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you have to do in some sense is </v>

624
00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:04.403
<v Speaker 1>restricted degree to which people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>choices determine their occupational </v>

625
00:35:06.931 --> 00:35:08.860
<v Speaker 1>outcomes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

626
00:35:08.861 --> 00:35:09.694
<v Speaker 1>and once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly clear that you'd like </v>

627
00:35:10.771 --> 00:35:13.100
<v Speaker 1>to live in a society that would do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it,</v>

628
00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:14.243
<v Speaker 1>unless you think that precisely quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>across every dimension in terms of </v>

629
00:35:18.241 --> 00:35:19.680
<v Speaker 1>occupational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

630
00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:22.093
<v Speaker 1>what the number of men in the number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>women in each occupation is such an </v>

631
00:35:25.051 --> 00:35:29.670
<v Speaker 1>important index that it actually trumps </v>
<v Speaker 1>what people as individuals actually want</v>

632
00:35:29.671 --> 00:35:32.970
<v Speaker 1>to do when you allow them free choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

633
00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:36.900
<v Speaker 1>so the big difference is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's one standard deviation.</v>

634
00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:41.700
<v Speaker 1>So to be as interested in things as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>typical man,</v>

635
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:46.680
<v Speaker 1>the typical woman would have to be more </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in things than 85% of women.</v>

636
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:48.473
<v Speaker 1>And to be more interested in people than</v>
<v Speaker 1>things to be as interested in people as </v>

637
00:35:53.761 --> 00:35:54.750
<v Speaker 1>the typical woman.</v>

638
00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:58.500
<v Speaker 1>A man would have to be more interested </v>
<v Speaker 1>in people than 85% of men.</v>

639
00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:00.900
<v Speaker 1>And that's starting to become a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>large difference.</v>

640
00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:04.860
<v Speaker 1>Now there's other differences too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is using the Holland categories.</v>

641
00:36:04.861 --> 00:36:05.694
<v Speaker 1>Holland is a very well renowned </v>
<v Speaker 1>industrial organizational psychologist </v>

642
00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:12.540
<v Speaker 1>and he divided jobs into these six </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories,</v>

643
00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:14.790
<v Speaker 1>realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigative,</v>

644
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:16.680
<v Speaker 1>artistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social,</v>

645
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:18.383
<v Speaker 1>enterprising and conventional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you see is that men show </v>

646
00:36:21.451 --> 00:36:22.650
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>realistic,</v>

647
00:36:22.651 --> 00:36:23.484
<v Speaker 1>and investigative interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The realistic category is particularly </v>

648
00:36:26.371 --> 00:36:27.204
<v Speaker 1>big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's eight tenths of a standard </v>

649
00:36:27.781 --> 00:36:30.270
<v Speaker 1>deviation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And women show strong artistic,</v>

650
00:36:30.271 --> 00:36:32.490
<v Speaker 1>social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and conventional interests.</v>

651
00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:33.503
<v Speaker 1>And there was no sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no gender difference at all in the </v>

652
00:36:34.951 --> 00:36:38.280
<v Speaker 1>degree to which people prefer an </v>
<v Speaker 1>enterprising occupations.</v>

653
00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:43.850
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's from the,</v>

654
00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:44.873
<v Speaker 1>from a different study from </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological bulletin looking at </v>

655
00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:48.540
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this,</v>

656
00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:52.890
<v Speaker 1>there's this phenomena that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people are quite upset about,</v>

657
00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:53.813
<v Speaker 1>especially in the u s although it's also</v>
<v Speaker 1>an issue in Germany that women are </v>

658
00:36:56.881 --> 00:36:59.310
<v Speaker 1>underrepresented in science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

659
00:36:59.311 --> 00:37:01.920
<v Speaker 1>engineering and mathematics dimensions.</v>

660
00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:03.593
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you look at the interests of men </v>

661
00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:07.824
<v Speaker 1>and women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see under men that men are 1.1 </v>

662
00:37:11.161 --> 00:37:11.994
<v Speaker 1>standard deviation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more likely to be interested in </v>

663
00:37:14.761 --> 00:37:15.594
<v Speaker 1>engineering and three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four tenths of a standard deviation to </v>

664
00:37:18.871 --> 00:37:19.704
<v Speaker 1>be more interested in math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>science and three tenths of a standard </v>

665
00:37:21.991 --> 00:37:24.210
<v Speaker 1>deviation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more interested in math.</v>

666
00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Now that has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

667
00:37:25.801 --> 00:37:28.620
<v Speaker 1>that has nothing to do with ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

668
00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:33.850
<v Speaker 1>for there there is some evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's really highly disputed and</v>

669
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:36.420
<v Speaker 1>the evidence I think keeps going back </v>
<v Speaker 1>and forth,</v>

670
00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:37.553
<v Speaker 1>that men are better at spacial rotation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that seems to be linked to </v>

671
00:37:40.231 --> 00:37:42.210
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

672
00:37:42.211 --> 00:37:43.044
<v Speaker 1>like I said this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea has been attacked very </v>

673
00:37:44.671 --> 00:37:45.700
<v Speaker 1>heavily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

674
00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:49.110
<v Speaker 1>there's also some evidence that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the intelligence distribution of</v>

675
00:37:49.111 --> 00:37:51.990
<v Speaker 1>men and women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the women women's distribution is a</v>

676
00:37:51.991 --> 00:37:54.660
<v Speaker 1>little higher peaked and little less </v>
<v Speaker 1>wide.</v>

677
00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:55.733
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is there's far more </v>
<v Speaker 1>men who fall into the extremely </v>

678
00:37:58.441 --> 00:37:59.274
<v Speaker 1>intellectually impaired category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that sort of seems to go along with </v>

679
00:38:03.481 --> 00:38:08.481
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the vast proportion of of </v>
<v Speaker 1>children in school who are in trouble,</v>

680
00:38:09.781 --> 00:38:10.614
<v Speaker 1>our boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're also overrepresented at the </v>

681
00:38:12.601 --> 00:38:16.500
<v Speaker 1>extreme upper end of the continuum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the mail distribution has flattened.</v>

682
00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:18.660
<v Speaker 1>And the people who believe that believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

683
00:38:18.661 --> 00:38:21.780
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's typical in animal communities,</v>

684
00:38:21.781 --> 00:38:22.614
<v Speaker 1>mammalian communities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for them to be more variability among </v>

685
00:38:24.631 --> 00:38:25.464
<v Speaker 1>the man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because men are expendable </v>

686
00:38:28.141 --> 00:38:28.974
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so in some sense the species can </v>

687
00:38:31.321 --> 00:38:34.500
<v Speaker 1>take a bigger chance with variability </v>
<v Speaker 1>even though the means remained the same.</v>

688
00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:39.160
<v Speaker 1>Now that was what Larry Summers was </v>
<v Speaker 1>referring to.</v>

689
00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:40.323
<v Speaker 1>He was a prison president of Harvard </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he suggested that there might be </v>

690
00:38:43.031 --> 00:38:45.100
<v Speaker 1>intellectual differences between men and</v>
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

691
00:38:45.101 --> 00:38:47.380
<v Speaker 1>That in part accounted for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences in,</v>

692
00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:49.390
<v Speaker 1>in stem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

693
00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:50.253
<v Speaker 1>prevalence.</v>

694
00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:52.330
<v Speaker 1>And he just got roasted for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

695
00:38:52.331 --> 00:38:54.610
<v Speaker 1>I think they fired him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was really unfair.</v>

696
00:38:54.611 --> 00:38:57.550
<v Speaker 1>I thought because he was just referring </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a study.</v>

697
00:38:57.551 --> 00:39:00.310
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't making a claim that that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>his opinion.</v>

698
00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:01.483
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can put that aside for the time </v>

699
00:39:03.581 --> 00:39:04.414
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like you need to invoke </v>

700
00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:12.610
<v Speaker 1>an intellectual capacity explanation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>account for the underrepresentation.</v>

701
00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:17.410
<v Speaker 1>You can just see that in the interests </v>
<v Speaker 1>diverged.</v>

702
00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:18.423
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could attribute that to stereotypes </v>

703
00:39:19.841 --> 00:39:20.674
<v Speaker 1>and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you run against running up </v>

704
00:39:22.421 --> 00:39:23.254
<v Speaker 1>against the problem that the differences</v>
<v Speaker 1>are bigger in the countries that have </v>

705
00:39:25.391 --> 00:39:27.970
<v Speaker 1>done the most to eradicate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotypes.</v>

706
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.983
<v Speaker 1>So I don't really see how that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis can survive as far as I'm </v>

707
00:39:33.911 --> 00:39:34.744
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just been proved wrong in the last </v>

708
00:39:37.061 --> 00:39:39.730
<v Speaker 1>10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gender differences are not primarily</v>

709
00:39:39.731 --> 00:39:42.040
<v Speaker 1>cultural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

710
00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:46.580
<v Speaker 1>so then you see this underrepresentation</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

711
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:49.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completing degree in employment in math,</v>

712
00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:51.043
<v Speaker 1>50% fewer women in math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40% in the physical science is 25% the </v>

713
00:39:55.081 --> 00:39:59.360
<v Speaker 1>computer science and 25% in engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

714
00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:03.780
<v Speaker 1>here's other occupational differences </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

715
00:40:03.781 --> 00:40:04.614
<v Speaker 1>that are quite extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's other reasons for </v>

716
00:40:06.871 --> 00:40:07.704
<v Speaker 1>these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that these are only </v>

717
00:40:08.521 --> 00:40:12.600
<v Speaker 1>interest related.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say what other differences,</v>

718
00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:14.310
<v Speaker 1>what are differences between men and </v>
<v Speaker 1>women?</v>

719
00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.141
<v Speaker 1>Just once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

720
00:40:17.141 --> 00:40:19.720
<v Speaker 1>There's the primary and secondary sexual</v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristics.</v>

721
00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:20.860
<v Speaker 1>What else is different?</v>

722
00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:24.310
<v Speaker 4>Adoption.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

723
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:29.900
<v Speaker 4>These jobs are more dangerous kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>jobs.</v>

724
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that that goes along with this sort</v>

725
00:40:32.561 --> 00:40:34.350
<v Speaker 1>of nail expandability issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

726
00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:35.763
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are board dangerous jobs in the </v>

727
00:40:37.931 --> 00:40:38.764
<v Speaker 1>probability that a man will be killed at</v>
<v Speaker 1>work is extraordinarily higher than the </v>

728
00:40:42.221 --> 00:40:44.170
<v Speaker 1>probability that a woman will be killed </v>
<v Speaker 1>at work.</v>

729
00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:46.300
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

730
00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.610
<v Speaker 1>what other differences are there between</v>
<v Speaker 1>men and women?</v>

731
00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:51.550
<v Speaker 1>Lennar and Margaret?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

732
00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:52.463
<v Speaker 1>there were about four inches taller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're known as much happier as you </v>

733
00:40:54.851 --> 00:40:56.730
<v Speaker 1>would think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was bigger than this.</v>

734
00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:01.760
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you one 64 versus one 94.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the American averages.</v>

735
00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:03.213
<v Speaker 1>So here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's differences between men and </v>

736
00:41:04.421 --> 00:41:06.910
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gender differences,</v>

737
00:41:06.911 --> 00:41:09.400
<v Speaker 1>these sort of physiological gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences.</v>

738
00:41:09.401 --> 00:41:10.234
<v Speaker 1>The cycle of psychological gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences to some degree too can be </v>

739
00:41:12.641 --> 00:41:15.790
<v Speaker 1>lumped under a biological category </v>
<v Speaker 1>called sexual dimorphism.</v>

740
00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.313
<v Speaker 1>And in some animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual dimorphism is how much </v>

741
00:41:20.021 --> 00:41:21.970
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason the morphology is between the</v>

742
00:41:21.971 --> 00:41:24.250
<v Speaker 1>male of the species and a female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this pcs,</v>

743
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:27.040
<v Speaker 1>and there can be a lot like with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elephant seals for example,</v>

744
00:41:27.041 --> 00:41:30.800
<v Speaker 1>the males are like 10 times bigger than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the females,</v>

745
00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:34.130
<v Speaker 1>usually in a situation like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the male has a Harem.</v>

746
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:38.990
<v Speaker 1>So there's extreme male reproductive </v>
<v Speaker 1>success on the part of a couple of males</v>

747
00:41:38.991 --> 00:41:41.870
<v Speaker 1>and then extreme male failure among the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of them.</v>

748
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:43.063
<v Speaker 1>So there's some seems to be some </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between lack of sexual </v>

749
00:41:46.941 --> 00:41:51.941
<v Speaker 1>dimorphism and monogamy among mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the last dimorphic,</v>

750
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:56.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a species is the more likely they are to</v>

751
00:41:56.001 --> 00:42:00.980
<v Speaker 1>pair bond and human beings are </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively non</v>

752
00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:07.110
<v Speaker 1>dimorphic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're a little are dimorphic than the</v>

753
00:42:07.111 --> 00:42:07.944
<v Speaker 1>typical monogamous animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a little less dimorphic than the </v>

754
00:42:10.381 --> 00:42:11.750
<v Speaker 1>typical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

755
00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:15.990
<v Speaker 1>polygamous animal and gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences.</v>

756
00:42:15.991 --> 00:42:16.824
<v Speaker 1>These sorts of gender differences with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the male being larger and more </v>

757
00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:22.470
<v Speaker 1>aggressive than the female are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of all mammals,</v>

758
00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.390
<v Speaker 1>although their characteristic of many of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

759
00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:25.950
<v Speaker 1>So the one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the major,</v>

760
00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:26.813
<v Speaker 1>the major exception or hyenas and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hyena females are very testosterone </v>

761
00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:34.350
<v Speaker 1>arised and they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's a word,</v>

762
00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:35.873
<v Speaker 1>they're very much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have very high levels of </v>

763
00:42:37.501 --> 00:42:38.334
<v Speaker 1>testosterone and they're slightly larger</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the males and they are more </v>

764
00:42:40.591 --> 00:42:41.424
<v Speaker 1>aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the price they pay for that is that </v>

765
00:42:43.021 --> 00:42:43.854
<v Speaker 1>their reproductive organs mimic the </v>
<v Speaker 1>penis and that's what they have to give </v>

766
00:42:47.311 --> 00:42:49.870
<v Speaker 1>birth through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it isn't exactly clear that that's a,</v>

767
00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure that's an advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

768
00:42:57.291 --> 00:42:58.124
<v Speaker 1>Well so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here are some of the differences </v>

769
00:42:59.061 --> 00:42:59.894
<v Speaker 1>between men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could see there's a five inch </v>

770
00:43:01.701 --> 00:43:04.310
<v Speaker 1>difference in height,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 30 pound difference in weight.</v>

771
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:05.563
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men are about 40 to 60% stronger in </v>

772
00:43:08.691 --> 00:43:10.940
<v Speaker 1>their upper body in about 70 to 75.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

773
00:43:10.941 --> 00:43:13.400
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>

774
00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:14.773
<v Speaker 1>Women are 40 to 60% as strong as men in </v>
<v Speaker 1>upper body strength and 70 to 75% in </v>

775
00:43:20.061 --> 00:43:23.990
<v Speaker 1>terms of low of lower body strength.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men have thicker jaws,</v>

776
00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:24.973
<v Speaker 1>heavier jaws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women who are ovulating prefer men with </v>

777
00:43:27.141 --> 00:43:28.040
<v Speaker 1>thicker jaws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

778
00:43:28.041 --> 00:43:28.874
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you show women pictures of the same </v>

779
00:43:30.951 --> 00:43:35.510
<v Speaker 1>men across their menstrual cycle and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do is widen the jaw,</v>

780
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:36.463
<v Speaker 1>the narrow jaw guy is more preferable </v>
<v Speaker 1>when there's less probability of </v>

781
00:43:40.191 --> 00:43:42.830
<v Speaker 1>conception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the wider jog guy is,</v>

782
00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:44.570
<v Speaker 1>is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

783
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:49.630
<v Speaker 1>more desirable when the probability of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ovulation is high and jaw dimensions are</v>

784
00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:53.330
<v Speaker 1>associated at least to some degree with </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression.</v>

785
00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:54.590
<v Speaker 1>Why would that be?</v>

786
00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Why would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's for biting.</v>

787
00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:01.041
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

788
00:44:01.041 --> 00:44:02.480
<v Speaker 1>think about animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they bite,</v>

789
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:04.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and human beings can bite too.</v>

790
00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:05.953
<v Speaker 1>So the jaw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between jaw dimension </v>

791
00:44:09.441 --> 00:44:10.274
<v Speaker 1>and disagreeable to say seems to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat of a hangover from our </v>

792
00:44:14.901 --> 00:44:15.734
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women have a higher proportion of body </v>

793
00:44:18.681 --> 00:44:21.740
<v Speaker 1>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women are very resistant to diseases.</v>

794
00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:24.350
<v Speaker 1>That's a good deal for women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They live longer.</v>

795
00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:28.010
<v Speaker 1>That's a good deal too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's way more male homicide victims,</v>

796
00:44:28.011 --> 00:44:32.910
<v Speaker 1>which seems spectacularly unfair until </v>
<v Speaker 1>you notice that there are many more male</v>

797
00:44:32.911 --> 00:44:33.744
<v Speaker 1>homicide perpetrators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which then seems to sort of even things </v>

798
00:44:36.541 --> 00:44:37.500
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

799
00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:42.540
<v Speaker 1>men kill non intimate acquaintances or </v>
<v Speaker 1>strangers,</v>

800
00:44:42.541 --> 00:44:46.980
<v Speaker 1>80% of the time where women kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>intimate partners or family members,</v>

801
00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:48.113
<v Speaker 1>60% of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course they're doing it a lot less </v>

802
00:44:50.131 --> 00:44:51.360
<v Speaker 1>frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

803
00:44:51.361 --> 00:44:52.194
<v Speaker 1>and you never know how many of those are</v>
<v Speaker 1>in something approximating desperation </v>

804
00:44:56.281 --> 00:44:57.510
<v Speaker 1>and self defense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

805
00:44:57.710 --> 00:45:00.210
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excluding the odd psychopathic woman.</v>

806
00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:02.980
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

807
00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:06.240
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

808
00:45:06.241 --> 00:45:08.400
<v Speaker 1>so back to these construction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forestry,</v>

809
00:45:08.401 --> 00:45:09.690
<v Speaker 1>mining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>utilities.</v>

810
00:45:09.691 --> 00:45:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can kind of see maybe that these are</v>

811
00:45:12.301 --> 00:45:14.250
<v Speaker 1>jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell me if you disagree,</v>

812
00:45:14.251 --> 00:45:18.930
<v Speaker 1>but these seem to me to be jobs that </v>
<v Speaker 1>might require more physical strength.</v>

813
00:45:18.931 --> 00:45:23.430
<v Speaker 1>That would certainly be the case in </v>
<v Speaker 1>forestry and mining and construction and</v>

814
00:45:23.431 --> 00:45:25.470
<v Speaker 1>likely in utility work too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

815
00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:28.020
<v Speaker 1>and then there are also things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs,</v>

816
00:45:28.021 --> 00:45:29.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these aren't,</v>

817
00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:30.803
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot of value on fostering </v>

818
00:45:35.131 --> 00:45:38.790
<v Speaker 1>close human relationships in these sorts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of occupations.</v>

819
00:45:38.791 --> 00:45:40.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

820
00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:43.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>

821
00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:45.750
<v Speaker 1>here's some interesting things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 most dogs,</v>

822
00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:50.780
<v Speaker 1>male dominated occupations in the u s so</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess one of the things that you might</v>

823
00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:54.390
<v Speaker 1>ask yourself is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

824
00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:57.860
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't you be interested in a job like</v>

825
00:45:57.861 --> 00:45:58.694
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So hypothetically man are more </v>

826
00:46:00.921 --> 00:46:04.510
<v Speaker 1>interested in jobs like this than women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brick Mason block,</v>

827
00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.440
<v Speaker 1>mason stone masons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

828
00:46:06.441 --> 00:46:08.660
<v Speaker 1>carving up stone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cement masons,</v>

829
00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:11.420
<v Speaker 1>electrical power line installers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>repairs.</v>

830
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:12.463
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aid be very hard to do that like during </v>

831
00:46:14.841 --> 00:46:16.760
<v Speaker 1>the ice storm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be hard job.</v>

832
00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:20.150
<v Speaker 1>Carpet floor and tile installers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heating,</v>

833
00:46:20.151 --> 00:46:21.650
<v Speaker 1>air conditioning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>refrigeration,</v>

834
00:46:21.651 --> 00:46:24.710
<v Speaker 1>mechanics structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>iron and rebar workers,</v>

835
00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:27.830
<v Speaker 1>bus and truck mechanics and diesel </v>
<v Speaker 1>engine specialists,</v>

836
00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:30.410
<v Speaker 1>miscellaneous vehicle in mobile </v>
<v Speaker 1>equipment,</v>

837
00:46:30.411 --> 00:46:32.840
<v Speaker 1>mechanics tool and die makers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>roofers.</v>

838
00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:35.810
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those are overwhelmingly male,</v>

839
00:46:35.811 --> 00:46:36.644
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look on the right hand column </v>

840
00:46:37.371 --> 00:46:38.204
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there isn't even 1% of the total number </v>

841
00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:46.490
<v Speaker 1>of women in those occupations isn't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>1% you know,</v>

842
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:48.223
<v Speaker 1>it's funny you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't hear a lot of like gender </v>

843
00:46:50.931 --> 00:46:55.730
<v Speaker 1>affirmative action calls for structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>iron and rebar worker,</v>

844
00:46:55.731 --> 00:46:56.900
<v Speaker 1>gender equality.</v>

845
00:46:57.590 --> 00:46:58.490
<v Speaker 1>So what's your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

846
00:46:58.491 --> 00:46:59.840
<v Speaker 1>I think that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

847
00:46:59.841 --> 00:47:00.674
<v Speaker 1>if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's merely a matter of gender </v>

848
00:47:01.941 --> 00:47:03.800
<v Speaker 1>inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then why does it differ?</v>

849
00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:05.210
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What difference does it make?</v>

850
00:47:05.211 --> 00:47:06.044
<v Speaker 1>What the category of employment is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sort of argument shouldn't be </v>

851
00:47:08.691 --> 00:47:13.070
<v Speaker 1>reserved for only the upper echelons and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most desirable jobs,</v>

852
00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:14.323
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise that's not a coherent </v>

853
00:47:16.881 --> 00:47:19.130
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It either applies across the spectrum of</v>

854
00:47:19.131 --> 00:47:21.590
<v Speaker 1>jobs or it's incoherent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the alternatives.</v>

855
00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:22.783
<v Speaker 1>So here's the 10 most female dominated </v>
<v Speaker 1>occupations in the U S it's still </v>

856
00:47:27.590 --> 00:47:29.800
<v Speaker 1>secretaries and administrative </v>
<v Speaker 1>assistance.</v>

857
00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

858
00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:35.550
<v Speaker 1>that was the most common female job in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 1950s and it is still overwhelmingly</v>

859
00:47:35.561 --> 00:47:38.830
<v Speaker 1>the most common female job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's quite interesting.</v>

860
00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Although it's incredibly dominated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

861
00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:45.370
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a good thing or a bad thing?</v>

862
00:47:45.371 --> 00:47:46.204
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that easy to tell childcare </v>

863
00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:50.980
<v Speaker 1>workers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that doesn't really come as much of</v>

864
00:47:50.981 --> 00:47:52.150
<v Speaker 1>a surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is,</v>

865
00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:53.920
<v Speaker 1>it is notable.</v>

866
00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:56.650
<v Speaker 1>And was one of the things you see in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavian countries,</v>

867
00:47:56.651 --> 00:47:58.270
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty much related to this,</v>

868
00:47:58.271 --> 00:48:00.380
<v Speaker 1>is that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this,</v>

869
00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:01.773
<v Speaker 1>there's a 20 to one difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men versus women in engineering and </v>

870
00:48:05.351 --> 00:48:08.350
<v Speaker 1>there's a 20 to one women versus men </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference in nursing.</v>

871
00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:10.053
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's this Scandinavian governments </v>

872
00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:12.993
<v Speaker 1>every now and then go through a fit of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of enthusiasm about attracting more </v>

873
00:48:16.811 --> 00:48:18.490
<v Speaker 1>women into engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they,</v>

874
00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:19.473
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crank up their social engineering in </v>

875
00:48:20.861 --> 00:48:24.550
<v Speaker 1>there and their information about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>desirable profession that is.</v>

876
00:48:24.551 --> 00:48:28.420
<v Speaker 1>And then the proportion of women who go </v>
<v Speaker 1>into engineering rises slightly,</v>

877
00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:30.550
<v Speaker 1>not very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as soon as they stop,</v>

878
00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:31.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing it hard,</v>

879
00:48:31.751 --> 00:48:35.950
<v Speaker 1>it just drops right back down to 5%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teacher assistants,</v>

880
00:48:35.951 --> 00:48:37.780
<v Speaker 1>registered nurses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bookkeeping,</v>

881
00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:41.140
<v Speaker 1>accounting and auditing clerks made in </v>
<v Speaker 1>housekeeping,</v>

882
00:48:41.141 --> 00:48:42.640
<v Speaker 1>cleaners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nursing,</v>

883
00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:46.750
<v Speaker 1>psychiatric and home health aides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal and home care aides and general</v>

884
00:48:46.751 --> 00:48:47.650
<v Speaker 1>office clerks.</v>

885
00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:50.110
<v Speaker 1>So that's where the bulk of women are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

886
00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:54.490
<v Speaker 1>that's where the bulk of the female </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominated occupations are.</v>

887
00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:57.550
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see,</v>

888
00:48:57.551 --> 00:48:58.870
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did I cover all those things?</v>

889
00:48:58.871 --> 00:48:59.704
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

890
00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:02.950
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

891
00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:05.380
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to figure this out for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a long time.</v>

892
00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Like what this agreeableness thing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is sort of what I've concluded,</v>

893
00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:10.893
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm always interested in tying </v>

894
00:49:12.461 --> 00:49:17.461
<v Speaker 1>this down to the biology and Jaak </v>
<v Speaker 1>Panksepp has a very good neuroscientist,</v>

895
00:49:17.611 --> 00:49:20.770
<v Speaker 1>is identified a number of fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological,</v>

896
00:49:20.771 --> 00:49:22.670
<v Speaker 1>emotional systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

897
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:26.470
<v Speaker 1>some of which we've alluded to already </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of which we really haven't.</v>

898
00:49:26.471 --> 00:49:27.304
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was Panksepp who identified the </v>

899
00:49:28.841 --> 00:49:33.160
<v Speaker 1>existence of a place system</v>
<v Speaker 1>for engaging,</v>

900
00:49:33.161 --> 00:49:35.020
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in rough and tumble play.</v>

901
00:49:35.021 --> 00:49:38.380
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to be something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>males prefer more than females prefer,</v>

902
00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:39.513
<v Speaker 1>but he's also identified a care system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could think about that as the </v>

903
00:49:42.431 --> 00:49:45.250
<v Speaker 1>basic it there has to be a care system.</v>

904
00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:46.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for God's sake,</v>

905
00:49:46.421 --> 00:49:47.560
<v Speaker 1>we're mammals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

906
00:49:47.561 --> 00:49:50.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the definition of a mammal is,</v>

907
00:49:50.111 --> 00:49:52.780
<v Speaker 1>well first the mammal is warm blooded </v>
<v Speaker 1>and has hair.</v>

908
00:49:52.781 --> 00:49:56.050
<v Speaker 1>But the next part of it is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mammal is fed breast milk.</v>

909
00:49:56.051 --> 00:50:00.340
<v Speaker 1>And so obviously there's a dependent </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship there and it's not only a,</v>

910
00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:04.330
<v Speaker 1>like it's a dependent relationship and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a difficult dependent relationship.</v>

911
00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:06.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like children are very,</v>

912
00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:08.013
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not able to care for themselves for a </v>

913
00:50:09.401 --> 00:50:10.234
<v Speaker 1>very long period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember if I mentioned to you </v>

914
00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:17.650
<v Speaker 1>this or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a mammal of our size should carry an</v>

915
00:50:17.651 --> 00:50:18.484
<v Speaker 1>infant for two years gestation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you should be pregnant for two years </v>

916
00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:24.340
<v Speaker 1>and then the baby would be born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And would be,</v>

917
00:50:24.341 --> 00:50:26.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for something walk round.</v>

918
00:50:26.681 --> 00:50:29.390
<v Speaker 1>And so like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like many mammals can as soon as they're</v>

919
00:50:29.391 --> 00:50:30.224
<v Speaker 1>born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because our heads are so big and </v>

920
00:50:33.141 --> 00:50:36.200
<v Speaker 1>because women's hips have to be narrow </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough so that they can run,</v>

921
00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:39.650
<v Speaker 1>there's an evolutionary arms race </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the structures in some sense.</v>

922
00:50:39.651 --> 00:50:41.960
<v Speaker 1>And so what's happened is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

923
00:50:41.961 --> 00:50:42.794
<v Speaker 1>women compromise by having wider hips </v>
<v Speaker 1>and babies compromised by having heads </v>

924
00:50:45.951 --> 00:50:46.784
<v Speaker 1>that can be be compressed during </v>
<v Speaker 1>childbirth and also by being born much </v>

925
00:50:50.961 --> 00:50:51.794
<v Speaker 1>earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the price that's paid for that is </v>

926
00:50:53.361 --> 00:50:57.020
<v Speaker 1>that they're incredibly dependent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

927
00:50:57.620 --> 00:50:58.820
<v Speaker 1>so when you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

928
00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:02.603
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

929
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:03.833
<v Speaker 1>there has to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's foolish to even argue </v>

930
00:51:06.421 --> 00:51:07.254
<v Speaker 1>otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People fall in love with their bayberry </v>

931
00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:10.793
<v Speaker 1>babies to a staggering degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the typical response of new parents </v>

932
00:51:14.311 --> 00:51:14.671
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

933
00:51:14.671 --> 00:51:18.090
<v Speaker 1>I never knew it would be like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>because even if you're not interested in</v>

934
00:51:18.091 --> 00:51:18.924
<v Speaker 1>someone else's baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tend to be unbelievably interested </v>

935
00:51:21.331 --> 00:51:22.164
<v Speaker 1>in your own baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a good thing because there </v>

936
00:51:24.331 --> 00:51:25.164
<v Speaker 1>are a lot of trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a system and maternal </v>

937
00:51:27.091 --> 00:51:28.770
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>primarily a care system.</v>

938
00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:30.513
<v Speaker 1>It's a system that's shared by men </v>
<v Speaker 1>because men are also very maternal for </v>

939
00:51:34.201 --> 00:51:35.034
<v Speaker 1>mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I believe that's on the one end </v>

940
00:51:37.621 --> 00:51:38.454
<v Speaker 1>of the agreeableness spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the maternal care system is </v>

941
00:51:41.461 --> 00:51:44.460
<v Speaker 1>what's driving empathy and sympathy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those things.</v>

942
00:51:44.461 --> 00:51:48.300
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think actually that it was the,</v>

943
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:54.510
<v Speaker 1>it was the expansion of the maternal </v>
<v Speaker 1>care system to include men that actually</v>

944
00:51:56.921 --> 00:52:00.100
<v Speaker 1>resulted in human beings capability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pair bond.</v>

945
00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:01.273
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird about people is that they share </v>

946
00:52:04.181 --> 00:52:06.250
<v Speaker 1>food because animals aren't very good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

947
00:52:06.251 --> 00:52:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Like chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll do it a little bit,</v>

948
00:52:07.361 --> 00:52:08.194
<v Speaker 1>but they're not too happy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And wolves sort of look like they share </v>

949
00:52:10.931 --> 00:52:12.550
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't really what happens.</v>

950
00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:13.563
<v Speaker 1>The dominant ones just eat until they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>full and then they don't mind if you </v>

951
00:52:16.331 --> 00:52:18.430
<v Speaker 1>know the subordinate ones eat what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>leftover.</v>

952
00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:20.680
<v Speaker 1>But human beings will share a food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

953
00:52:20.681 --> 00:52:21.514
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>female mammals often share food with </v>

954
00:52:23.411 --> 00:52:24.244
<v Speaker 1>their infants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't generally share food </v>

955
00:52:25.901 --> 00:52:26.770
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

956
00:52:26.771 --> 00:52:28.660
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their compatriot.</v>

957
00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:30.610
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about all the,</v>

958
00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:34.900
<v Speaker 1>think about the language that couples </v>
<v Speaker 1>who were in love use to each other.</v>

959
00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:36.393
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a real infant tile element to </v>

960
00:52:37.781 --> 00:52:38.200
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

961
00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:39.033
<v Speaker 1>It's baby and deer and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make little cooing noises and they </v>

962
00:52:41.981 --> 00:52:44.650
<v Speaker 1>give each other a little pet names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's something that's,</v>

963
00:52:44.830 --> 00:52:46.690
<v Speaker 1>that's like there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

964
00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:47.553
<v Speaker 1>there's a juvenile element to it that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to me to be a consequence of the </v>

965
00:52:52.001 --> 00:52:54.490
<v Speaker 1>activation of this care system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

966
00:52:54.491 --> 00:52:58.360
<v Speaker 1>between adults rather than from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>adult to the child.</v>

967
00:52:58.690 --> 00:53:01.210
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

968
00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:03.430
<v Speaker 1>then on the other end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

969
00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:07.120
<v Speaker 1>there's a predatory aggression system </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that they've,</v>

970
00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:11.230
<v Speaker 1>they've come together in evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>history to balance each other out.</v>

971
00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:14.980
<v Speaker 1>So both men and women are carrying and </v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory,</v>

972
00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:17.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women more caring and less predatory and</v>

973
00:53:17.951 --> 00:53:18.784
<v Speaker 1>men more predatory and less caring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But both genders have that both </v>

974
00:53:23.471 --> 00:53:27.290
<v Speaker 1>capacities within them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think they've evolved so that they</v>

975
00:53:27.291 --> 00:53:28.124
<v Speaker 1>are mutually inhibitory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that a predatory male is not that </v>

976
00:53:32.611 --> 00:53:35.280
<v Speaker 1>likely to kill infants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas,</v>

977
00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:38.100
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fairly likely to care for them.</v>

978
00:53:39.570 --> 00:53:41.340
<v Speaker 1>Now there are exceptions to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

979
00:53:41.341 --> 00:53:42.510
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're not trivial.</v>

980
00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:44.400
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

981
00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:48.320
<v Speaker 1>stepchildren are much more likely to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed,</v>

982
00:53:49.310 --> 00:53:54.310
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're under two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are at 100 times more risk for abuse</v>

983
00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:57.830
<v Speaker 1>from a step parent than you are from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural parent.</v>

984
00:53:58.730 --> 00:54:01.100
<v Speaker 1>And so you see echoes of this in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal kingdom too.</v>

985
00:54:01.101 --> 00:54:01.934
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a girl has have harems and then of </v>

986
00:54:05.031 --> 00:54:07.050
<v Speaker 1>course one gorilla has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

987
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:10.940
<v Speaker 1>offspring with a variety of female </v>
<v Speaker 1>gorillas and all the adolescent grillers</v>

988
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:11.783
<v Speaker 1>is sort of outside that little circle </v>
<v Speaker 1>just waiting and tapping their feet for </v>

989
00:54:15.441 --> 00:54:18.610
<v Speaker 1>the guy in the middle to get tired or </v>
<v Speaker 1>hungry or you know,</v>

990
00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:21.230
<v Speaker 1>exhausted so they can come and run in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and you know,</v>

991
00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:24.200
<v Speaker 1>overthrow him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally when they do that,</v>

992
00:54:24.201 --> 00:54:27.350
<v Speaker 1>they kill all the infants and so to </v>
<v Speaker 1>lions,</v>

993
00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:29.563
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

994
00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:31.950
<v Speaker 1>no predation and care systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

995
00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:32.793
<v Speaker 1>they're very tightly balanced and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are influenced to a large degree by </v>

996
00:54:36.931 --> 00:54:39.420
<v Speaker 1>genetic similarity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rough as that is.</v>

997
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:42.463
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

998
00:54:43.590 --> 00:54:47.490
<v Speaker 1>in caring professions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>5% males,</v>

999
00:54:49.450 --> 00:54:50.620
<v Speaker 1>let's look at predation.</v>

1000
00:54:53.070 --> 00:54:57.210
<v Speaker 1>8% of the male population hunts exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quite large number.</v>

1001
00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:59.310
<v Speaker 1>When you think about how many people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>urban,</v>

1002
00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:00.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's hard for,</v>

1003
00:55:00.451 --> 00:55:02.400
<v Speaker 1>what are you gonna we'd get hunt </v>
<v Speaker 1>raccoons,</v>

1004
00:55:02.401 --> 00:55:03.234
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean once you're in an urban </v>

1005
00:55:04.771 --> 00:55:06.690
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that straight forward to hunt,</v>

1006
00:55:06.691 --> 00:55:08.910
<v Speaker 1>but in a rural environment it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's you know,</v>

1007
00:55:08.911 --> 00:55:09.744
<v Speaker 1>right there for you fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's only 8% of the male population </v>

1008
00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:15.450
<v Speaker 1>in the u s that hunts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1009
00:55:15.451 --> 00:55:16.284
<v Speaker 1>you have to factor the urbanization </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue in their 91% of those people are </v>

1010
00:55:19.741 --> 00:55:20.574
<v Speaker 1>male.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So hunting isn't something that </v>

1011
00:55:21.961 --> 00:55:23.580
<v Speaker 1>generally appeals to women.</v>

1012
00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:29.760
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>now</v>

1013
00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:36.660
<v Speaker 1>what other reasons might there be for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the gender differences?</v>

1014
00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:37.853
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is more speculative than what I've </v>

1015
00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:42.420
<v Speaker 1>discussed with you so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can think about it.</v>

1016
00:55:42.421 --> 00:55:43.254
<v Speaker 1>I mean these are the things I'm trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get straight and so I'm going to </v>

1017
00:55:46.141 --> 00:55:50.460
<v Speaker 1>share you share with you some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathways of my current thinking.</v>

1018
00:55:50.730 --> 00:55:51.563
<v Speaker 1>So there is evidence that more </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable people are more likely to </v>

1019
00:55:55.441 --> 00:55:58.560
<v Speaker 1>be successful as managers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1020
00:55:58.561 --> 00:55:59.394
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Boudreau who wrote a paper called </v>

1021
00:56:01.741 --> 00:56:04.530
<v Speaker 1>effects of personality on executive </v>
<v Speaker 1>career success,</v>

1022
00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:05.903
<v Speaker 1>said the following,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness associates with being </v>

1023
00:56:08.401 --> 00:56:10.350
<v Speaker 1>trusting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>submissive and compliant,</v>

1024
00:56:10.650 --> 00:56:14.580
<v Speaker 1>which could be perceived as naivete </v>
<v Speaker 1>docility and a tendency to follow rather</v>

1025
00:56:14.581 --> 00:56:16.230
<v Speaker 1>than lead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1026
00:56:16.231 --> 00:56:20.640
<v Speaker 1>so that's his opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then here's what he measured.</v>

1027
00:56:20.641 --> 00:56:25.210
<v Speaker 1>So these are effects of five traits on </v>
<v Speaker 1>career success.</v>

1028
00:56:25.211 --> 00:56:25.721
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1029
00:56:25.721 --> 00:56:28.480
<v Speaker 1>career success can obviously be defined </v>
<v Speaker 1>a number of ways.</v>

1030
00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:32.680
<v Speaker 1>It could be career satisfaction or it </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be like external markers of career</v>

1031
00:56:32.681 --> 00:56:33.620
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1032
00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:34.463
<v Speaker 1>and they did both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to look at direct cause </v>

1033
00:56:36.491 --> 00:56:37.324
<v Speaker 1>that's the external sort of objective </v>
<v Speaker 1>markers weren't you see is that if </v>

1034
00:56:41.201 --> 00:56:42.034
<v Speaker 1>you're high in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not so good for how much money </v>

1035
00:56:44.891 --> 00:56:47.290
<v Speaker 1>you make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a negative correlation of 0.3,</v>

1036
00:56:47.410 --> 00:56:49.930
<v Speaker 1>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big correlation.</v>

1037
00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:51.633
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll hear people say that 0.5 is a </v>

1038
00:56:54.191 --> 00:56:56.660
<v Speaker 1>large correlation and 0.3 is moderate </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1039
00:56:56.661 --> 00:57:01.661
<v Speaker 1>point to a small and that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that that was clarified four or five</v>

1040
00:57:02.501 --> 00:57:04.020
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1041
00:57:04.450 --> 00:57:06.520
<v Speaker 1>I'll get the paper for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>

1042
00:57:06.521 --> 00:57:09.130
<v Speaker 1>It was an American psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the guy who wrote the paper,</v>

1043
00:57:09.131 --> 00:57:12.880
<v Speaker 1>what he did was he looked at a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of social science studies and then</v>

1044
00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:16.360
<v Speaker 1>calculated how frequently different </v>
<v Speaker 1>effects sizes showed up.</v>

1045
00:57:16.361 --> 00:57:21.250
<v Speaker 1>And what he found was that 0.5 was </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably large.</v>

1046
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:22.503
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that 5% of social science studies </v>

1047
00:57:25.691 --> 00:57:26.524
<v Speaker 1>ever got a correlation of 0.5,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you get a correlation of </v>

1048
00:57:28.781 --> 00:57:29.614
<v Speaker 1>0.5 and your study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've either made a dramatic error or </v>

1049
00:57:31.841 --> 00:57:35.740
<v Speaker 1>you've replicated something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>already well known or you know you're in</v>

1050
00:57:35.741 --> 00:57:39.040
<v Speaker 1>science because it never happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Point three,</v>

1051
00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:41.800
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty good correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1052
00:57:43.110 --> 00:57:43.530
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1053
00:57:43.530 --> 00:57:44.363
<v Speaker 1>so the fact that neuroticism is </v>
<v Speaker 1>negatively correlated with how much </v>

1054
00:57:46.621 --> 00:57:49.060
<v Speaker 1>money you make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how likely you are to ascend,</v>

1055
00:57:49.170 --> 00:57:53.670
<v Speaker 1>and then how close you are to being ceo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously the effects size decrease.</v>

1056
00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:55.410
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1057
00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:58.200
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism is oss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or sorry,</v>

1058
00:57:58.590 --> 00:57:59.423
<v Speaker 1>extroversion is a reasonable predictor </v>
<v Speaker 1>only of how much of your ascending and </v>

1059
00:58:04.861 --> 00:58:06.810
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1060
00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:10.950
<v Speaker 1>openness has a correlation with how much</v>
<v Speaker 1>money you make,</v>

1061
00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:14.490
<v Speaker 1>but that's probably because openness is </v>
<v Speaker 1>highly associated with intelligence.</v>

1062
00:58:14.491 --> 00:58:18.330
<v Speaker 1>And so openness is not a good marker for</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

1063
00:58:18.331 --> 00:58:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Iq tests are much better markers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's an attenuated relationship.</v>

1064
00:58:21.451 --> 00:58:22.830
<v Speaker 1>But then you look at agreeableness,</v>

1065
00:58:24.830 --> 00:58:25.320
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1066
00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:28.920
<v Speaker 1>it's negative 0.3,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two in total,</v>

1067
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:29.783
<v Speaker 1>put negative 0.2,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four for direct in terms of how much </v>

1068
00:58:31.471 --> 00:58:32.550
<v Speaker 1>money you make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1069
00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:33.413
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting thing because one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the things that determines how much </v>

1070
00:58:36.841 --> 00:58:39.750
<v Speaker 1>money you make is how willing you are to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say no.</v>

1071
00:58:41.110 --> 00:58:43.360
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you're negotiating with someone</v>

1072
00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:44.493
<v Speaker 1>then</v>

1073
00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:49.350
<v Speaker 1>the only thing you have at your back is </v>
<v Speaker 1>your ability to say no and to push it or</v>

1074
00:58:49.351 --> 00:58:51.360
<v Speaker 1>even to ask for a raise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1075
00:58:51.361 --> 00:58:53.610
<v Speaker 1>pushy people are much more likely to ask</v>
<v Speaker 1>for race.</v>

1076
00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:56.730
<v Speaker 1>And of course those who ask for a raise </v>
<v Speaker 1>are much more likely to get it.</v>

1077
00:58:57.030 --> 00:58:59.010
<v Speaker 1>So the guys who were hard to get along </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1078
00:58:59.011 --> 00:59:00.990
<v Speaker 1>because most of the people that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to get along with,</v>

1079
00:59:00.991 --> 00:59:03.120
<v Speaker 1>our guys are more likely to be paid </v>
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

1080
00:59:03.210 --> 00:59:05.700
<v Speaker 1>They're more likely do as sand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporate ladder.</v>

1081
00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:09.060
<v Speaker 1>They're more likely to be close to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>CEO in terms of proximity.</v>

1082
00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:10.470
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1083
00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:14.070
<v Speaker 1>they're even more likely to be rated as </v>
<v Speaker 1>employable.</v>

1084
00:59:14.370 --> 00:59:16.980
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because you'd think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1085
00:59:16.981 --> 00:59:19.290
<v Speaker 1>if you're agreeable in easy to get along</v>
<v Speaker 1>with and all that,</v>

1086
00:59:19.291 --> 00:59:22.700
<v Speaker 1>that people would be more to rate you as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a suitable employee.</v>

1087
00:59:22.701 --> 00:59:25.370
<v Speaker 1>But that is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the opposite seems to happen.</v>

1088
00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:29.930
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the agreeable guys are less satisfied</v>

1089
00:59:29.931 --> 00:59:34.931
<v Speaker 1>with their jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1090
00:59:40.431 --> 00:59:41.264
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the agreeable people are less satisfied </v>

1091
00:59:42.261 --> 00:59:44.240
<v Speaker 1>with their jobs as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1092
00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:46.773
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now let's look at motivation </v>

1093
00:59:47.921 --> 00:59:52.060
<v Speaker 1>variables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the extroverts work more evenings.</v>

1094
00:59:52.061 --> 00:59:53.020
<v Speaker 1>The agreeable people,</v>

1095
00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:57.370
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeable people are less likely to,</v>

1096
01:00:04.030 --> 01:00:04.863
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1097
01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:08.193
<v Speaker 1>So it's a funny thing too because </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable extroverts are narcissists </v>

1098
01:00:12.251 --> 01:00:14.860
<v Speaker 1>and there's some evidence that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>derive from this data.</v>

1099
01:00:14.861 --> 01:00:15.694
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause there's always this talk about </v>

1100
01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:18.633
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable extroverts are narcissists </v>
<v Speaker 1>being more likely to rise up to CEO </v>

1101
01:00:21.251 --> 01:00:24.610
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there is some evidence for that,</v>

1102
01:00:24.611 --> 01:00:28.300
<v Speaker 1>at least in so far is agreeableness is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative predictor of doing such.</v>

1103
01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:30.933
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1104
01:00:31.050 --> 01:00:31.883
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things we've just found is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one of the predictors for </v>

1105
01:00:35.290 --> 01:00:39.700
<v Speaker 1>ascendancy and proximity to a high </v>
<v Speaker 1>status position is low.</v>

1106
01:00:39.701 --> 01:00:41.560
<v Speaker 1>Agreeableness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1107
01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:44.590
<v Speaker 1>the next thing you might think about is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1108
01:00:44.650 --> 01:00:47.380
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what role does that play in terms of the</v>

1109
01:00:47.381 --> 01:00:50.380
<v Speaker 1>factors that men and women find </v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive at each other?</v>

1110
01:00:50.381 --> 01:00:52.150
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1111
01:00:53.170 --> 01:00:55.390
<v Speaker 1>what do you want in a mate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a woman,</v>

1112
01:00:55.391 --> 01:00:56.410
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>

1113
01:00:56.411 --> 01:01:00.670
<v Speaker 1>you want someone who's kind and loving </v>
<v Speaker 1>and forgiving and empathic and those are</v>

1114
01:01:00.671 --> 01:01:02.230
<v Speaker 1>all good things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1115
01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:03.513
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't necessarily the case that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the empirical studies show that that's </v>

1116
01:01:07.001 --> 01:01:09.340
<v Speaker 1>what drives mate selection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we could look,</v>

1117
01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:12.520
<v Speaker 1>this is an interesting study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a few years old,</v>

1118
01:01:12.550 --> 01:01:17.550
<v Speaker 1>thousand French Canadian respondents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>433 males and 700 females.</v>

1119
01:01:19.371 --> 01:01:20.930
<v Speaker 1>And so here are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here are the variables.</v>

1120
01:01:21.290 --> 01:01:22.123
<v Speaker 1>One is possession of resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a composite index composed of </v>

1121
01:01:25.881 --> 01:01:28.760
<v Speaker 1>occupational prestige,</v>
<v Speaker 1>income and education.</v>

1122
01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:32.990
<v Speaker 1>And then the other variables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>acquisition of partners,</v>

1123
01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:33.853
<v Speaker 1>sexual partners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is number of lifetime and </v>

1124
01:01:36.891 --> 01:01:37.724
<v Speaker 1>proceeding year sexual partners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lifetime occurrence of simultaneous </v>

1125
01:01:41.061 --> 01:01:41.894
<v Speaker 1>partners says yes or no variable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifetime frequency of simultaneous </v>

1126
01:01:45.411 --> 01:01:48.050
<v Speaker 1>partners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one to five with five being very often.</v>

1127
01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Here's the assumption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

1128
01:01:52.930 --> 01:01:54.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decide for yourself if you think this is</v>

1129
01:01:54.851 --> 01:01:57.010
<v Speaker 1>a warranted assumption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The number of partners,</v>

1130
01:01:57.011 --> 01:01:57.844
<v Speaker 1>a member of sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a acquires is taken as an index of how </v>

1131
01:02:00.881 --> 01:02:03.970
<v Speaker 1>often this individual is chosen by sex </v>
<v Speaker 1>b.</v>

1132
01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:07.030
<v Speaker 1>So that's an indication of re </v>
<v Speaker 1>reproductive fitness,</v>

1133
01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:07.893
<v Speaker 1>desirability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least as assessed by members of the </v>

1134
01:02:09.491 --> 01:02:12.400
<v Speaker 1>opposite sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you would think would be the logical</v>

1135
01:02:12.610 --> 01:02:16.960
<v Speaker 1>judges for that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Male criteria</v>

1136
01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:20.280
<v Speaker 1>166 on attached</v>

1137
01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:24.030
<v Speaker 3>women ages 25 to 50 correlation between </v>
<v Speaker 3>fertility rates,</v>

1138
01:02:24.031 --> 01:02:24.864
<v Speaker 3>a number of partners and previous year </v>
<v Speaker 3>equals 0.94 males choose fertility </v>

1139
01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:32.640
<v Speaker 3>indicators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beauty waist to hip ratio,</v>

1140
01:02:32.641 --> 01:02:36.270
<v Speaker 3>youthful appearance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and neotenous facial features.</v>

1141
01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:37.413
<v Speaker 3>Neotenous means there's a tendency among</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals as they evolve to increasingly </v>

1142
01:02:44.161 --> 01:02:47.670
<v Speaker 3>look more in their adult stages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like their juvenile forms.</v>

1143
01:02:48.270 --> 01:02:50.280
<v Speaker 3>So here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's an example.</v>

1144
01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:53.070
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the skull of a baby </v>
<v Speaker 3>chimpanzee,</v>

1145
01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:56.010
<v Speaker 3>it looks almost exactly like the skull </v>
<v Speaker 3>of an adult human.</v>

1146
01:02:56.910 --> 01:02:57.743
<v Speaker 3>So what's happened is we've as adults,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're more like baby chimpanzees then </v>

1147
01:03:02.730 --> 01:03:04.380
<v Speaker 3>than the adult chimpanzees are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've,</v>

1148
01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:05.393
<v Speaker 3>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've maintained a lot of our juvenile </v>

1149
01:03:08.371 --> 01:03:09.930
<v Speaker 3>characteristics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>playfulness,</v>

1150
01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ability to continue to learn,</v>

1151
01:03:11.850 --> 01:03:13.410
<v Speaker 3>plasticity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all those things.</v>

1152
01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:14.573
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a preference in our objective </v>

1153
01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:19.013
<v Speaker 3>beauty analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say a facial features for men to prefer </v>

1154
01:03:21.930 --> 01:03:24.690
<v Speaker 3>more neotenous female faces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1155
01:03:24.810 --> 01:03:27.540
<v Speaker 3>and you can tell that if you look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>pictures of models,</v>

1156
01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:29.820
<v Speaker 3>they generally have relatively small </v>
<v Speaker 3>noses,</v>

1157
01:03:29.821 --> 01:03:30.840
<v Speaker 3>relatively big eyes.</v>

1158
01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:31.883
<v Speaker 3>The sort of things that are associated </v>
<v Speaker 3>with cute and cute actually is a pretty </v>

1159
01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:40.380
<v Speaker 3>pretty identifiable category.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the things that people find cute</v>

1160
01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:41.273
<v Speaker 3>have large eyes and relatively the rest </v>
<v Speaker 3>of their facial features are relatively </v>

1161
01:03:44.791 --> 01:03:47.100
<v Speaker 3>small.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's other things that are associated</v>

1162
01:03:47.101 --> 01:03:49.350
<v Speaker 3>with cute that aren't necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with,</v>

1163
01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:50.673
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual attractiveness cause cute things </v>

1164
01:03:52.410 --> 01:03:54.960
<v Speaker 3>also have sort of random movements like </v>
<v Speaker 3>baby,</v>

1165
01:03:54.961 --> 01:03:57.390
<v Speaker 3>like movements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the things that people,</v>

1166
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:58.543
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>relatively short arms and just think of </v>

1167
01:04:00.391 --> 01:04:01.830
<v Speaker 3>a teddy bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

1168
01:04:01.831 --> 01:04:04.230
<v Speaker 3>those are the male,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are the male criteria,</v>

1169
01:04:04.590 --> 01:04:05.423
<v Speaker 3>female criteria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all respondents correlation between </v>

1170
01:04:09.061 --> 01:04:12.480
<v Speaker 3>socioeconomic status and frequency of </v>
<v Speaker 3>simultaneous partners.</v>

1171
01:04:13.110 --> 01:04:16.500
<v Speaker 3>For men it was 0.49 that's a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>correlation.</v>

1172
01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:21.000
<v Speaker 3>For Women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was 0.04 that's a zero fundamentally.</v>

1173
01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:22.133
<v Speaker 3>So the correlation between male </v>
<v Speaker 3>socioeconomic status and frequency of </v>

1174
01:04:26.251 --> 01:04:31.251
<v Speaker 3>simultaneous partners is 0.5.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a huge effect for women at zero.</v>

1175
01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:33.330
<v Speaker 3>And that's a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1176
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:35.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things you might ask yourself</v>

1177
01:04:35.251 --> 01:04:36.084
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if this is a reasonable </v>

1178
01:04:37.081 --> 01:04:39.840
<v Speaker 3>thing to ask or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

1179
01:04:42.410 --> 01:04:43.580
<v Speaker 1>I've always thought that</v>

1180
01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:48.650
<v Speaker 1>the hard people to explain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the people who are hyper achievers,</v>

1181
01:04:48.770 --> 01:04:51.860
<v Speaker 1>you know the ones who are way out on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frito distribution and there aren't very</v>

1182
01:04:51.861 --> 01:04:54.770
<v Speaker 1>many of them and they're usually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're usually man,</v>

1183
01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:56.173
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at the media num number </v>

1184
01:04:57.231 --> 01:04:58.520
<v Speaker 1>of publications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1185
01:04:58.521 --> 01:05:00.830
<v Speaker 1>that a female academic makes had a male </v>
<v Speaker 1>academic,</v>

1186
01:05:00.831 --> 01:05:04.250
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty much the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the mean for men is higher.</v>

1187
01:05:04.251 --> 01:05:05.084
<v Speaker 1>And that's all driven by a small subset </v>
<v Speaker 1>of men who are way the hell out in the </v>

1188
01:05:07.641 --> 01:05:09.560
<v Speaker 1>prieto distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might ask,</v>

1189
01:05:09.561 --> 01:05:10.520
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that?</v>

1190
01:05:10.730 --> 01:05:12.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's simple.</v>

1191
01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:14.990
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be way out on the prieto </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>

1192
01:05:14.991 --> 01:05:18.520
<v Speaker 1>so you're in the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say 1% of performers or even one 10th of</v>

1193
01:05:18.521 --> 01:05:20.950
<v Speaker 1>1% of performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you have to do?</v>

1194
01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:24.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first having an Iq of like 145 or above,</v>

1195
01:05:24.550 --> 01:05:28.540
<v Speaker 1>that's really helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you should be insanely industrious.</v>

1196
01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:29.403
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you'll work 90 hours a week or </v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred hours a week at nothing but </v>

1197
01:05:34.091 --> 01:05:34.924
<v Speaker 1>your stupid occupation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe we'll do that for like 50 </v>

1198
01:05:37.361 --> 01:05:39.640
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you do that while you're going</v>

1199
01:05:39.641 --> 01:05:43.540
<v Speaker 1>to be in that top one in 1000 category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well</v>

1200
01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:48.210
<v Speaker 1>the issue isn't why there are so few </v>
<v Speaker 1>women in that category.</v>

1201
01:05:48.330 --> 01:05:51.510
<v Speaker 1>The issue is why are there any men at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all in that category,</v>

1202
01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:52.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's,</v>

1203
01:05:52.650 --> 01:05:55.470
<v Speaker 1>it's an insane lifestyle in many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1204
01:05:55.471 --> 01:05:58.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1205
01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:01.760
<v Speaker 1>it means that there isn't much left </v>
<v Speaker 1>there for the rest of your life.</v>

1206
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:04.400
<v Speaker 1>You're hyper concentrating on a single </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1207
01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:07.370
<v Speaker 1>Now why would men do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1208
01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:08.473
<v Speaker 1>here's the hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that drives the </v>

1209
01:06:11.991 --> 01:06:12.824
<v Speaker 1>probability that a woman will find a man</v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive enough to sleep with his his </v>

1210
01:06:16.251 --> 01:06:17.150
<v Speaker 1>status.</v>

1211
01:06:18.930 --> 01:06:19.920
<v Speaker 1>So then you can think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1212
01:06:19.921 --> 01:06:22.170
<v Speaker 1>that's an extra motivational boost for </v>
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>

1213
01:06:22.171 --> 01:06:23.490
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether that's conscious,</v>

1214
01:06:23.491 --> 01:06:26.670
<v Speaker 1>motivational boost or not is not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

1215
01:06:26.970 --> 01:06:28.110
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it a,</v>

1216
01:06:28.111 --> 01:06:28.944
<v Speaker 1>is it a boost that might have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantiated as an evolutionary element </v>

1217
01:06:32.521 --> 01:06:35.340
<v Speaker 1>of general motivation or men are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive,</v>

1218
01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:36.263
<v Speaker 1>they're more disagreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if they're more disagreeable and </v>

1219
01:06:39.321 --> 01:06:40.950
<v Speaker 1>more competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they seem to do better,</v>

1220
01:06:40.951 --> 01:06:41.784
<v Speaker 1>especially in high status jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then women are more likely to pick </v>

1221
01:06:45.181 --> 01:06:46.014
<v Speaker 1>man like that for sexual partners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's at some point it becomes </v>

1222
01:06:48.811 --> 01:06:53.811
<v Speaker 1>difficult to avoid the conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially since we know that the man on</v>

1223
01:06:54.751 --> 01:06:55.584
<v Speaker 1>the way out on the tail end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prieto distribution are </v>

1224
01:06:58.381 --> 01:07:01.830
<v Speaker 1>disproportionately likely to sleep with </v>
<v Speaker 1>many women.</v>

1225
01:07:02.850 --> 01:07:07.770
<v Speaker 1>So Warren Beatty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think 15,000 that was his estimate,</v>

1226
01:07:08.130 --> 01:07:10.440
<v Speaker 1>15,000 women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1227
01:07:12.030 --> 01:07:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Kareem Abdul Jabbar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the basketball player,</v>

1228
01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:18.230
<v Speaker 1>he figured 10,000 so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so for the,</v>

1229
01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:22.140
<v Speaker 1>for every one guy who's got those </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers racked up,</v>

1230
01:07:22.141 --> 01:07:22.974
<v Speaker 1>that's 10,000 guys who don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the male success distribution is </v>

1231
01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:29.573
<v Speaker 1>extreme and it's associated with outlier</v>
<v Speaker 1>success in some important dimension of </v>

1232
01:07:37.851 --> 01:07:38.684
<v Speaker 1>socioeconomic economic success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then female rep productive </v>

1233
01:07:44.391 --> 01:07:48.470
<v Speaker 1>opportunity is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1234
01:07:48.471 --> 01:07:51.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that relevant?</v>

1235
01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:52.371
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1236
01:07:52.371 --> 01:07:55.370
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for me to see that it can't be</v>

1237
01:07:55.371 --> 01:07:59.000
<v Speaker 1>relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So questions if the question,</v>

1238
01:08:00.850 --> 01:08:03.680
<v Speaker 4>the higher the job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the higher status,</v>

1239
01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:06.940
<v Speaker 4>the more partners they have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Yup,</v>

1240
01:08:07.530 --> 01:08:08.170
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

1241
01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:09.670
<v Speaker 1>Slowly and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>

1242
01:08:09.671 --> 01:08:13.210
<v Speaker 1>this is a single study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this data is Coleman.</v>

1243
01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:14.323
<v Speaker 1>Now there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some interesting correlates of </v>

1244
01:08:16.281 --> 01:08:17.750
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1245
01:08:17.751 --> 01:08:18.584
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are males much more likely to be to </v>

1246
01:08:23.301 --> 01:08:24.134
<v Speaker 1>engage in homicide?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Daly and Wilson figured this out a </v>

1247
01:08:27.391 --> 01:08:29.870
<v Speaker 1>long while back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what they showed was very,</v>

1248
01:08:29.871 --> 01:08:32.780
<v Speaker 1>very cool study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took</v>

1249
01:08:34.490 --> 01:08:37.460
<v Speaker 1>the level of income inequality in each </v>
<v Speaker 1>county,</v>

1250
01:08:37.461 --> 01:08:38.294
<v Speaker 1>in the u s and in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they correlated that with the </v>

1251
01:08:40.911 --> 01:08:41.744
<v Speaker 1>homicide rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what they found was that the higher </v>

1252
01:08:44.421 --> 01:08:46.880
<v Speaker 1>the rate of inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the more people at the bottom and the</v>

1253
01:08:46.881 --> 01:08:51.460
<v Speaker 1>fewer people at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the higher than male homicide rate.</v>

1254
01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:53.500
<v Speaker 1>And the correlation was</v>

1255
01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:55.080
<v Speaker 3>okay</v>

1256
01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:58.410
<v Speaker 1>0.8 something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Point eight five it was like,</v>

1257
01:08:58.980 --> 01:08:59.813
<v Speaker 1>it's the whole reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is that when the </v>

1258
01:09:02.581 --> 01:09:07.581
<v Speaker 1>competition between men gets intense </v>
<v Speaker 1>because hardly anyone can win than males</v>

1259
01:09:08.871 --> 01:09:09.750
<v Speaker 1>start to kill each other.</v>

1260
01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:11.530
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1261
01:09:11.530 --> 01:09:12.363
<v Speaker 1>Now daily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also Martin and daily also tried to </v>

1262
01:09:15.071 --> 01:09:15.904
<v Speaker 1>figure it out if that was a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they studied Chicago and what they </v>

1263
01:09:18.701 --> 01:09:19.534
<v Speaker 1>found was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well most male and male homicides are </v>

1264
01:09:21.911 --> 01:09:22.744
<v Speaker 1>young man and a lot of them there within</v>
<v Speaker 1>race and they're often in dominance </v>

1265
01:09:26.921 --> 01:09:27.940
<v Speaker 1>disputes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1266
01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:30.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a gang thing and it's like,</v>

1267
01:09:30.551 --> 01:09:31.384
<v Speaker 1>well you shoot me or I'll shoot you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like who's victim and who's </v>

1268
01:09:34.421 --> 01:09:37.030
<v Speaker 1>perpetrator is not that obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens in Chicago?</v>

1269
01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:38.590
<v Speaker 1>Well typically</v>

1270
01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:43.310
<v Speaker 1>the charge is plea bargain down to self </v>
<v Speaker 1>defense.</v>

1271
01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:48.350
<v Speaker 1>Then no one's willing to testify against</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guide because well after all he just</v>

1272
01:09:48.351 --> 01:09:51.800
<v Speaker 1>shot someone and then he's in prison for</v>
<v Speaker 1>two years cause that's the,</v>

1273
01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:54.740
<v Speaker 1>that's the sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he's out in 18 months.</v>

1274
01:09:54.741 --> 01:09:55.574
<v Speaker 1>If he behaves reasonably well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then he's killed someone and he's </v>

1275
01:09:58.371 --> 01:10:00.380
<v Speaker 1>back on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And guess what,</v>

1276
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:01.783
<v Speaker 1>his status has increased substantially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can think about it as a socio </v>

1277
01:10:06.071 --> 01:10:06.904
<v Speaker 1>economic slash sexual decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we also know that as economic </v>

1278
01:10:11.571 --> 01:10:16.220
<v Speaker 1>disparity grows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the social stability decreases.</v>

1279
01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:17.263
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well mostly it seems to be male on male </v>

1280
01:10:20.511 --> 01:10:21.440
<v Speaker 1>aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what I,</v>

1281
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:22.303
<v Speaker 1>what I think probably happens is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's a fair bit of chance for men </v>

1282
01:10:27.081 --> 01:10:27.914
<v Speaker 1>to climb the ladder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then only the most disagreeable of them </v>

1283
01:10:30.921 --> 01:10:31.754
<v Speaker 1>become violent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as you crank down on the </v>

1284
01:10:33.861 --> 01:10:36.860
<v Speaker 1>opportunities so that the competition </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets more and more intense,</v>

1285
01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:38.143
<v Speaker 1>the level of disagreeableness that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes in order to catalyze aggression </v>

1286
01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:43.393
<v Speaker 1>starts the level of disagreeableness </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it takes to catalyze aggression </v>

1287
01:10:46.461 --> 01:10:47.294
<v Speaker 1>starts to decrease until if it gets so </v>
<v Speaker 1>intense that there's no possibility for </v>

1288
01:10:50.901 --> 01:10:53.330
<v Speaker 1>status,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the whole bloody society's going to</v>

1289
01:10:53.331 --> 01:10:56.120
<v Speaker 1>flip over because the guys at the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are like,</v>

1290
01:10:56.121 --> 01:10:56.954
<v Speaker 1>all the guys are going to decide that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a stupid game and they'd rather </v>

1291
01:10:59.631 --> 01:11:03.950
<v Speaker 1>flip the board over and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>set the markers to zero and see how they</v>

1292
01:11:03.951 --> 01:11:05.300
<v Speaker 1>come up in the new society.</v>

1293
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:06.703
<v Speaker 1>So it's possible that</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that motivates </v>

1294
01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:18.120
<v Speaker 1>revolutions in human society is </v>
<v Speaker 1>excessive inequality.</v>

1295
01:11:18.150 --> 01:11:18.983
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that that's a problem is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's so tightly linked to male </v>

1296
01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:24.990
<v Speaker 1>reproductive opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1297
01:11:27.550 --> 01:11:28.040
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1298
01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:28.873
<v Speaker 1>look at age 30 to 39 correlation between</v>
<v Speaker 1>socioeconomic status and frequency of </v>

1299
01:11:33.411 --> 01:11:35.120
<v Speaker 1>simultaneous partners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Man,</v>

1300
01:11:35.121 --> 01:11:38.810
<v Speaker 1>the correlations 0.92 it's very small </v>
<v Speaker 1>land for women,</v>

1301
01:11:38.811 --> 01:11:43.130
<v Speaker 1>it was 0.11 it's difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect and zero.</v>

1302
01:11:43.131 --> 01:11:43.964
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>female criteria might reflect the </v>

1303
01:11:47.421 --> 01:11:50.600
<v Speaker 1>tendency on the part of females to </v>
<v Speaker 1>choose high status partners during their</v>

1304
01:11:50.601 --> 01:11:51.434
<v Speaker 1>own peak reproductive years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This might account for the especially </v>

1305
01:11:54.051 --> 01:11:54.884
<v Speaker 1>strong relationship found in men age 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>to 39 women who typically prefer men </v>

1306
01:11:59.631 --> 01:12:00.464
<v Speaker 1>three to eight years older than they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>would then be in their mid to late </v>

1307
01:12:03.770 --> 01:12:04.603
<v Speaker 1>twenties a time when fecundability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that sensitivity to male resources </v>

1308
01:12:07.370 --> 01:12:08.203
<v Speaker 1>is at its peak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evolutionary related hypotheses about </v>

1309
01:12:13.401 --> 01:12:14.234
<v Speaker 1>gender differences and mate selection </v>
<v Speaker 1>preferences were derived from Trevor's </v>

1310
01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:18.283
<v Speaker 1>Parental Investment Model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which contends that women are more </v>

1311
01:12:20.841 --> 01:12:21.674
<v Speaker 1>likely than men to seek a mate who </v>
<v Speaker 1>possesses nonphysical characteristics </v>

1312
01:12:24.951 --> 01:12:25.784
<v Speaker 1>that maximize the survival or </v>
<v Speaker 1>reproductive prospects of their </v>

1313
01:12:28.281 --> 01:12:29.450
<v Speaker 1>offspring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Offspring</v>

1314
01:12:31.150 --> 01:12:32.050
<v Speaker 1>as predicted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women.</v>

1315
01:12:32.051 --> 01:12:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh square accorded more weight than men </v>
<v Speaker 1>to socioeconomic status.</v>

1316
01:12:35.261 --> 01:12:37.990
<v Speaker 1>Ambitiousness character and </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

1317
01:12:38.410 --> 01:12:39.243
<v Speaker 1>And the largest gender differences were </v>
<v Speaker 1>observed for cues to resource </v>

1318
01:12:41.921 --> 01:12:45.490
<v Speaker 1>acquisition status and ambitiousness as </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicted,</v>

1319
01:12:45.491 --> 01:12:46.324
<v Speaker 1>gender differences were not found in </v>
<v Speaker 1>preferences for characteristics </v>

1320
01:12:49.241 --> 01:12:53.590
<v Speaker 1>unrelated to progeny survival,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of humor or personality</v>

1321
01:12:56.750 --> 01:12:57.583
<v Speaker 1>when valid comparisons could be made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The findings were generally invariant </v>

1322
01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:03.440
<v Speaker 1>across generations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures and research paradigms.</v>

1323
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:06.583
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1324
01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:14.140
<v Speaker 1>any questions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about that?</v>

1325
01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:15.153
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1326
01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:17.740
<v Speaker 1>it's harder stuff as far as I can tell.</v>

1327
01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:24.030
<v Speaker 3>Does that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the character,</v>

1328
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:27.050
<v Speaker 1>what we did a study that unfortunately I</v>
<v Speaker 1>never published,</v>

1329
01:13:27.051 --> 01:13:28.340
<v Speaker 1>we showed women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

1330
01:13:28.341 --> 01:13:30.980
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women aren't after resources.</v>

1331
01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:33.350
<v Speaker 1>That's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thereafter,</v>

1332
01:13:33.351 --> 01:13:34.184
<v Speaker 1>the factors that predict resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what we did was we showed women a </v>

1333
01:13:38.961 --> 01:13:41.120
<v Speaker 1>bunch of pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was this say,</v>

1334
01:13:41.210 --> 01:13:42.043
<v Speaker 1>say several pictures of the same guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was several guys and each guy </v>

1335
01:13:46.851 --> 01:13:47.684
<v Speaker 1>was in four conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The photo of each guy was in four </v>

1336
01:13:49.401 --> 01:13:50.450
<v Speaker 1>conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same photo,</v>

1337
01:13:50.451 --> 01:13:54.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one guy was poor and stupid,</v>

1338
01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:56.000
<v Speaker 1>pouring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>useless.</v>

1339
01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:57.433
<v Speaker 1>One guy was rich and useless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One guy was rich and useful and one guy </v>

1340
01:14:01.191 --> 01:14:04.310
<v Speaker 1>was poor and useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the rich,</v>

1341
01:14:04.370 --> 01:14:05.203
<v Speaker 1>useless guy had won the lottery and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>paid out like $4,000 a month for the </v>

1342
01:14:08.571 --> 01:14:10.790
<v Speaker 1>rest of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So no matter how useless he was,</v>

1343
01:14:10.791 --> 01:14:13.150
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had resources,</v>

1344
01:14:13.151 --> 01:14:14.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The poor,</v>

1345
01:14:14.231 --> 01:14:16.780
<v Speaker 1>useless guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we don't even have to define that.</v>

1346
01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:19.960
<v Speaker 1>Everybody understands that the rich </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful guy.</v>

1347
01:14:19.961 --> 01:14:20.794
<v Speaker 1>Well that's easy to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The poor useful guy worked for </v>

1348
01:14:22.601 --> 01:14:24.550
<v Speaker 1>nongovernmental agency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a charity,</v>

1349
01:14:24.610 --> 01:14:26.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a charitable organization.</v>

1350
01:14:26.141 --> 01:14:26.974
<v Speaker 1>And so he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had high occupational status but low </v>

1351
01:14:29.501 --> 01:14:33.910
<v Speaker 1>income and that wasn't likely to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then we asked women to rate these men</v>

1352
01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:34.783
<v Speaker 1>on a bunch of different attributes </v>
<v Speaker 1>including personality but also on data </v>

1353
01:14:38.561 --> 01:14:39.394
<v Speaker 1>ability basically and also on </v>
<v Speaker 1>probability of considering a longterm </v>

1354
01:14:42.430 --> 01:14:45.940
<v Speaker 1>relationship with someone like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what else had no main effect?</v>

1355
01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:49.150
<v Speaker 1>The only effect was usefulness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the poor,</v>

1356
01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:52.030
<v Speaker 1>useful guy and the rich useful guy where</v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive,</v>

1357
01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:53.133
<v Speaker 1>more attractive to the women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the two useless guys regardless of </v>

1358
01:14:55.541 --> 01:14:58.410
<v Speaker 1>their socioeconomic status and the women</v>
<v Speaker 1>judged.</v>

1359
01:14:58.411 --> 01:15:02.800
<v Speaker 1>The useful guys is higher in openness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and conscientiousness,</v>

1360
01:15:02.801 --> 01:15:03.634
<v Speaker 1>which was pretty smart because openness </v>
<v Speaker 1>is basically intelligence and </v>

1361
01:15:05.801 --> 01:15:06.634
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness is hard work and those</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the best predictor of socioeconomic </v>

1362
01:15:09.851 --> 01:15:11.470
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yay women.</v>

1363
01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Good work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any other questions?</v>

1364
01:15:18.570 --> 01:15:19.403
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1365
01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:21.940
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly appearance.</v>

1366
01:15:21.941 --> 01:15:25.900
<v Speaker 1>It's more like signs of health and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's associated.</v>

1367
01:15:26.830 --> 01:15:27.663
<v Speaker 1>It isn't even that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that have made women </v>

1368
01:15:31.390 --> 01:15:32.223
<v Speaker 1>attracted to men across time are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are associated with health </v>

1369
01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:38.230
<v Speaker 1>and therefore reproductive capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1370
01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:42.460
<v Speaker 1>waist to hip ratio was a marker 0.68 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to be about ideal.</v>

1371
01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1372
01:15:44.650 --> 01:15:49.190
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that women who have a lower</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher,</v>

1373
01:15:50.030 --> 01:15:52.660
<v Speaker 1>huh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't figure it out at the moment.</v>

1374
01:15:53.230 --> 01:15:57.910
<v Speaker 1>More waste than hips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arma are more likely to die.</v>

1375
01:15:57.911 --> 01:15:59.860
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of cardiovascular disease.</v>

1376
01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:02.650
<v Speaker 1>It's an unhealthy distribution of body </v>
<v Speaker 1>fat for women.</v>

1377
01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:06.340
<v Speaker 1>And so that seems to be a negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>fitness marker.</v>

1378
01:16:06.670 --> 01:16:10.600
<v Speaker 1>And then symmetry for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean women like symmetrical men too,</v>

1379
01:16:10.601 --> 01:16:15.560
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but man are more attracted say to,</v>

1380
01:16:16.530 --> 01:16:19.980
<v Speaker 1>to physical health than women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1381
01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:21.663
<v Speaker 1>what are the markers for physical health</v>
<v Speaker 1>is also symmetry and that's associated </v>

1382
01:16:24.731 --> 01:16:26.890
<v Speaker 1>with beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clear skin.</v>

1383
01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:29.650
<v Speaker 1>All these things are associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>health and youthfulness.</v>

1384
01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

1385
01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:34.690
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty much that.</v>

1386
01:16:35.290 --> 01:16:36.160
<v Speaker 4>What about like,</v>

1387
01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:42.193
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had actually had a paper that I was </v>

1388
01:16:44.301 --> 01:16:48.320
<v Speaker 1>looking at that this morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't have enough time to include</v>

1389
01:16:48.321 --> 01:16:49.154
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know exactly what the </v>

1390
01:16:50.091 --> 01:16:53.000
<v Speaker 1>predictors there are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

1391
01:16:53.001 --> 01:16:53.834
<v Speaker 1>They'd be</v>

1392
01:16:58.970 --> 01:17:03.970
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

1393
01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:08.160
<v Speaker 4>male characteristics</v>

1394
01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:09.561
<v Speaker 1>you'd think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1395
01:17:09.561 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

1396
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:10.580
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would be,</v>

1397
01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:12.410
<v Speaker 4>that would be a very useful thing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>look up.</v>

1398
01:17:15.790 --> 01:17:16.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1399
01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Attractiveness.</v>

1400
01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:19.073
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1401
01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Hard to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hard to say.</v>

1402
01:17:24.250 --> 01:17:27.280
<v Speaker 1>But a quick glance at popular culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>would suggest so.</v>

1403
01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:32.150
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
