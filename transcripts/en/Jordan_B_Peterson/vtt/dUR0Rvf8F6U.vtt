1
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this does my reproduction</v>

2
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.073
<v Speaker 1>piece</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the conceptual level between group </v>

3
00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:31.510
<v Speaker 1>identification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever stage of moral</v>

4
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.393
<v Speaker 1>coming after it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the idea here is think of this </v>

5
00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:39.594
<v Speaker 1>initial stage is childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes a horse presumptions of did </v>

6
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.970
<v Speaker 1>undergo a horse disintegration </v>
<v Speaker 1>adolescence,</v>

7
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.750
<v Speaker 1>I suppose mostly for biological reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that</v>

8
00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:58.803
<v Speaker 1>cause a physiological changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment to which someone has to </v>

9
00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:05.050
<v Speaker 1>adapt changes dramatically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And adolescents,</v>

10
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:06.543
<v Speaker 1>the world isn't the same place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so whoever you were as a child has to </v>

11
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:13.860
<v Speaker 1>undergo mark revision in order for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to become an adult.</v>

12
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.850
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is that half the age of </v>
<v Speaker 1>14 or so,</v>

13
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.040
<v Speaker 1>you're not really ready to become an </v>
<v Speaker 1>adult,</v>

14
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.090
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that means and the intermediary</v>

15
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.290
<v Speaker 1>intermediary process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's trying to draw</v>

16
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 1>between that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the notion of an apprenticeship</v>

17
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.620
<v Speaker 1>and then the final stages.</v>

18
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.843
<v Speaker 1>Another accomplished by means of another</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of more than all this </v>

19
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:48.294
<v Speaker 1>information in all this information and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hits this time would be the fact that </v>

20
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.690
<v Speaker 1>that there are more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was more than one group.</v>

21
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.140
<v Speaker 1>I guess that might be the simplest way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to describe it.</v>

22
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.413
<v Speaker 1>If you're a traditional Jew for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not such a problem unless you </v>

23
00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:10.170
<v Speaker 1>have to share a territory with </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional Christian,</v>

24
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.040
<v Speaker 1>in which case the fact that group </v>
<v Speaker 1>identification,</v>

25
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.400
<v Speaker 1>the mere fact that then becomes a form </v>
<v Speaker 1>of anomalous information that requires a</v>

26
00:02:18.401 --> 00:02:19.234
<v Speaker 1>solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The solution can be obliterate your </v>

27
00:02:21.451 --> 00:02:24.930
<v Speaker 1>enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is I think,</v>

28
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.850
<v Speaker 1>denial of anomalous information because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with obliterating your enemy</v>

29
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:30.693
<v Speaker 1>is that you're making the presupposition</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all of the things that we had to </v>

30
00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:39.291
<v Speaker 1>offer you were worthless and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably an error of the mid size</v>

31
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.480
<v Speaker 1>everything is that just because you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>rid of someone,</v>

32
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.230
<v Speaker 1>you tend not to get rid of the ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they represent.</v>

33
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those ideas pop up again,</v>

34
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.360
<v Speaker 1>sometimes in the form of schismatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>movements within your own culture.</v>

35
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.830
<v Speaker 1>If the culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if an enemy culture is being successful,</v>

36
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.800
<v Speaker 1>that sort of indicates that it's come up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with ideas that are good and the chances</v>

37
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:03.634
<v Speaker 1>are that you're not going to get rid of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those ideas if you get rid of those </v>

38
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a pretty,</v>

39
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.080
<v Speaker 1>it's a kind of a temporary solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vast.</v>

40
00:03:10.081 --> 00:03:10.914
<v Speaker 1>It might also be really </v>
<v Speaker 1>counterproductive in the long run </v>

41
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 1>because the things that your enemy knows</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be things that you need to know,</v>

42
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.183
<v Speaker 1>but maybe not right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always possible to that they know </v>

43
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:23.780
<v Speaker 1>some things you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that there's,</v>

44
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:24.773
<v Speaker 1>I mean ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess what I'm trying to say in the </v>

45
00:03:25.451 --> 00:03:26.284
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think it isn't an analogy on </v>

46
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:27.874
<v Speaker 1>the sociopolitical level between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>repression of enemies groups and the </v>

47
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.073
<v Speaker 1>process of repression of anomalous </v>
<v Speaker 1>information at the level of the </v>

48
00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:38.404
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

49
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.430
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

50
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.273
<v Speaker 1>that's an analogy that I'll keep much </v>
<v Speaker 1>more often than the last part of this </v>

51
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.070
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

52
00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:51.460
<v Speaker 1>the question is where do you go from </v>
<v Speaker 1>group identification?</v>

53
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.980
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that seems to be what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next stage,</v>

54
00:03:56.981 --> 00:03:59.800
<v Speaker 1>or at least an insulary or auxiliary </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage,</v>

55
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.993
<v Speaker 1>is to know that there's a process that </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterize as the construction of </v>

56
00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:08.860
<v Speaker 1>groups themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

57
00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:11.470
<v Speaker 1>I think if you think your group is </v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable,</v>

58
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:12.304
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to make the claim </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the process that made the group </v>

59
00:04:15.041 --> 00:04:17.560
<v Speaker 1>isn't more valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see you're sort of,</v>

60
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.990
<v Speaker 1>you're sort of trapped by that precept </v>
<v Speaker 1>position right off,</v>

61
00:04:19.991 --> 00:04:23.260
<v Speaker 1>right off the bat species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your group's valuable,</v>

62
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.690
<v Speaker 1>the process that created it is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable.</v>

63
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.840
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a necessarily logical conclusion.</v>

64
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.810
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you,</v>

65
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I told you this story </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

66
00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:32.944
<v Speaker 1>but there's was an interesting example </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this sort of argument in the New </v>

67
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:37.503
<v Speaker 1>Testament which I actually quote later </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this [inaudible] where the Pharisees </v>

68
00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:47.490
<v Speaker 1>are attempting to trap Christ into </v>
<v Speaker 1>staying something heretical so that they</v>

69
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.590
<v Speaker 1>can totally prisoner killed him and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>says to one of the,</v>

70
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.913
<v Speaker 1>essentially you're the sort of person </v>
<v Speaker 1>who would have killed the prophets who </v>

71
00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:01.880
<v Speaker 1>constructed the group that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned,</v>

72
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.993
<v Speaker 1>which was really</v>
<v Speaker 1>maximally effective installed and also </v>

73
00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:09.100
<v Speaker 1>absolutely true.</v>

74
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.043
<v Speaker 1>Now contacting the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember which book that at the </v>

75
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.393
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of read that as the comment that </v>

76
00:05:17.141 --> 00:05:17.974
<v Speaker 1>more or less sealed his fate section </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially credible in salt uses a </v>

77
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:27.640
<v Speaker 1>variant of that as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I don't remember</v>

78
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.843
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

79
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.120
<v Speaker 1>Stay in here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is your group identification.</v>

80
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.003
<v Speaker 1>You forfeit this process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is is that the process </v>

81
00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:47.560
<v Speaker 1>that constructed the group is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable that the growth,</v>

82
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.510
<v Speaker 1>so if you identify with your group as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian structure,</v>

83
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:54.303
<v Speaker 1>then you necessarily sever your </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection with the process that the </v>

84
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.440
<v Speaker 1>group and that constitutes a form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual death.</v>

85
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.550
<v Speaker 1>So in terms of constructing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate hierarchy of values,</v>

86
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:09.403
<v Speaker 1>when you realize that there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong with the answer of group </v>

87
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:16.910
<v Speaker 1>identification to the processes of life </v>
<v Speaker 1>are to the questions of life,</v>

88
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.583
<v Speaker 1>the next stage is to recognize that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is the possibility of identifying </v>

89
00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:25.124
<v Speaker 1>with the process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what this diagram is trying to </v>

90
00:06:26.421 --> 00:06:27.254
<v Speaker 1>represent.</v>

91
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.200
<v Speaker 1>I would say in primitive primitive cells</v>
<v Speaker 1>first new aren't confined.</v>

92
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.113
<v Speaker 1>This position is the sharman stay going </v>
<v Speaker 1>through their own individual process of </v>

93
00:06:40.671 --> 00:06:43.730
<v Speaker 1>initiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't necessarily the group foster,</v>

94
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.130
<v Speaker 1>and I was thinking about that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>

95
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:48.523
<v Speaker 1>It's also the case that the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is interesting showman's for </v>

96
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.473
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Siberians have a working vocabulary </v>

97
00:06:56.601 --> 00:06:57.434
<v Speaker 1>that's many times greater than that of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their compatriots who aren't shauna </v>

98
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.710
<v Speaker 1>because they're the repository of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire world tradition of the tribe.</v>

99
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.690
<v Speaker 1>And which means they have the bill of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights because they're not,</v>

100
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.910
<v Speaker 1>they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>

101
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.273
<v Speaker 1>So it is the case that the showman is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not only someone who's an individual in </v>

102
00:07:19.101 --> 00:07:21.560
<v Speaker 1>the true sense of the word being outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the group,</v>

103
00:07:21.561 --> 00:07:22.394
<v Speaker 1>although necessary part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's also the master of the group to a </v>

104
00:07:25.161 --> 00:07:28.070
<v Speaker 1>much greater degree than any of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who were normally identified with</v>

105
00:07:28.071 --> 00:07:28.904
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a good lesson because what </v>

106
00:07:30.051 --> 00:07:32.840
<v Speaker 1>it says is 50 get here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really have to be in there,</v>

107
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:37.870
<v Speaker 1>which is something you pointed out last </v>
<v Speaker 1>week that you don't get like we think,</v>

108
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.313
<v Speaker 1>I think we think in the west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the pathologies of </v>

109
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.850
<v Speaker 1>primitive self help psychology that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can get from here to here.</v>

110
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.510
<v Speaker 1>This is used to be vaguely construed </v>
<v Speaker 1>without without this.</v>

111
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.680
<v Speaker 1>And we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

112
00:07:51.681 --> 00:07:54.170
<v Speaker 1>we love any of these intermediary </v>
<v Speaker 1>stages.</v>

113
00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.033
<v Speaker 1>That's a big mistake</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is literally somewhere </v>

114
00:08:03.261 --> 00:08:07.580
<v Speaker 1>beyond this and that means it has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything decision plus something else.</v>

115
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:10.023
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you said in the class that we can </v>

116
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.263
<v Speaker 2>pass on wisdom regenerations right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We think we passed on through conscious </v>

117
00:08:17.321 --> 00:08:18.680
<v Speaker 2>of attraction or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

118
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.573
<v Speaker 2>through all lot of different processes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it seems that if it can be passed </v>

119
00:08:22.541 --> 00:08:23.361
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>

120
00:08:23.361 --> 00:08:24.194
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the spoken word at three </v>

121
00:08:25.481 --> 00:08:26.314
<v Speaker 2>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like people don't necessarily </v>

122
00:08:27.971 --> 00:08:31.240
<v Speaker 2>have to go through chaos to advance to </v>
<v Speaker 2>another identity.</v>

123
00:08:31.241 --> 00:08:33.040
<v Speaker 2>If they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this stuff can be passed on,</v>

124
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:39.500
<v Speaker 1>we'll go with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

125
00:08:39.501 --> 00:08:42.440
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the information is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't necessarily,</v>

126
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:43.603
<v Speaker 1>as you were pointing out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't necessarily mean that you're </v>

127
00:08:44.731 --> 00:08:49.731
<v Speaker 1>in contact with him is traumatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

128
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.280
<v Speaker 1>hang on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have another diagram.</v>

129
00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.340
<v Speaker 1>We'll address that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's again,</v>

130
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:55.763
<v Speaker 1>depends on the level at which the </v>
<v Speaker 1>anomalous or current school curves </v>

131
00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.513
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are more and less traumatic </v>

132
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:02.370
<v Speaker 1>lemons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

133
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.350
<v Speaker 1>I tried to tell you a little bit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that before,</v>

134
00:09:04.351 --> 00:09:05.670
<v Speaker 1>the notion that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

135
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:07.043
<v Speaker 1>if you're going somewhere and one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your ways of getting there as blocked </v>

136
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:10.733
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that constitutes in the nautilus </v>

137
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:12.384
<v Speaker 1>occurrence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're going somewhere and then </v>

138
00:09:14.281 --> 00:09:15.114
<v Speaker 1>the place itself disappears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a completely different class of </v>

139
00:09:18.421 --> 00:09:21.870
<v Speaker 1>the dance and events in the first class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While they're all listening to this.</v>

140
00:09:21.871 --> 00:09:22.704
<v Speaker 1>And the second class are no homeless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but obviously having to switch plans is </v>

141
00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:28.530
<v Speaker 1>nowhere near as traumatic as having to </v>
<v Speaker 1>switch ideals.</v>

142
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:30.023
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might think about as a </v>

143
00:09:31.021 --> 00:09:32.930
<v Speaker 1>qualitative difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when you go up.</v>

144
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:33.803
<v Speaker 1>It's not that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'll take a look at most a tree </v>

145
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.140
<v Speaker 1>like the tree to cut it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

146
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.710
<v Speaker 1>It's very much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very much like like,</v>

147
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.650
<v Speaker 1>like like the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

148
00:09:43.651 --> 00:09:45.810
<v Speaker 1>so this is what we were discussing last </v>
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>

149
00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:47.403
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

150
00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:52.893
<v Speaker 1>it's obvious that people can tolerate a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of normal information </v>

151
00:09:57.070 --> 00:10:01.360
<v Speaker 1>that's equally obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there were severities of anomalies,</v>

152
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.540
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people construe as intolerable.</v>

153
00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:08.350
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that we need to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to construct a conceptual model.</v>

154
00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:09.483
<v Speaker 1>It will help us to determine how under </v>
<v Speaker 1>what circumstances and normally is how </v>

155
00:10:16.031 --> 00:10:20.170
<v Speaker 1>to determine the relative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our effect and intensity of an anomalous</v>

156
00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:21.730
<v Speaker 1>occurrence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

157
00:10:21.731 --> 00:10:26.290
<v Speaker 1>Because obviously some forms of normally</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trivial in some are major and it</v>

158
00:10:26.291 --> 00:10:29.440
<v Speaker 1>would be good to figure out under what </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances they are trivial and maybe</v>

159
00:10:29.441 --> 00:10:30.274
<v Speaker 1>what circumstances their major,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the things I want you to keep </v>

160
00:10:32.381 --> 00:10:35.860
<v Speaker 1>it in the back of your mind because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is really useful even for those</v>

161
00:10:35.861 --> 00:10:38.110
<v Speaker 1>of you that are interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopathology,</v>

162
00:10:38.111 --> 00:10:40.480
<v Speaker 1>say on a scientific level here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's why.</v>

163
00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:43.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you develop a phobia,</v>

164
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:45.183
<v Speaker 1>the theory for the development of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phobia is exposure to the thing that </v>

165
00:10:47.861 --> 00:10:48.700
<v Speaker 1>caused the phobia.</v>

166
00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.160
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most safe for you're afraid of mice.</v>

167
00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:52.150
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

168
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.983
<v Speaker 1>but the problem with that theory is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cure is exposure to has been very </v>

169
00:10:55.931 --> 00:10:56.764
<v Speaker 1>difficult in the behavioral literature </v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out why exposing yourself to </v>

170
00:11:00.551 --> 00:11:02.690
<v Speaker 1>the same thing that causes your problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Curiously,</v>

171
00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.960
<v Speaker 1>when it was exposure to that thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>begin with,</v>

172
00:11:04.961 --> 00:11:07.930
<v Speaker 1>the doors of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a very difficult problem.</v>

173
00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:11.740
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two types of [inaudible],</v>

174
00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:14.223
<v Speaker 1>two basic types and one hero is where </v>
<v Speaker 1>are you accidentally and counted them </v>

175
00:11:16.721 --> 00:11:17.554
<v Speaker 1>knowing and then you die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And none of your myth is where you come </v>

176
00:11:21.341 --> 00:11:22.174
<v Speaker 1>in voluntarily and then you live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the difference between the </v>

177
00:11:26.471 --> 00:11:27.304
<v Speaker 1>kind of exposures that creates mythology</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the kind of exposure that creates </v>

178
00:11:29.741 --> 00:11:30.574
<v Speaker 1>healing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're a behavior therapist </v>

179
00:11:31.331 --> 00:11:32.164
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is you set up the </v>

180
00:11:32.771 --> 00:11:33.604
<v Speaker 1>circumstances so that the person you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to treat voluntarily encounters </v>

181
00:11:36.731 --> 00:11:37.960
<v Speaker 1>counters the anonymous experience.</v>

182
00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.470
<v Speaker 1>So basically you cast them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing playing her own ritual.</v>

183
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:42.733
<v Speaker 1>And in the ritual you're casting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie of the rule of the hero who's </v>

184
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:47.110
<v Speaker 1>willing to encounter the enormous </v>
<v Speaker 1>information voluntarily.</v>

185
00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:48.123
<v Speaker 1>And this isn't just a trait rereading of</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopathological literature and </v>

186
00:11:51.121 --> 00:11:51.954
<v Speaker 1>exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know we that if you take someone </v>

187
00:11:54.971 --> 00:11:56.950
<v Speaker 1>who's afraid of an elevator into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the elevator,</v>

188
00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:58.970
<v Speaker 1>and they avoid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people will do that.</v>

189
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:03.040
<v Speaker 1>So even if you get them in the owner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll not look at it if you can,</v>

190
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.353
<v Speaker 1>if you can convince them to take the </v>
<v Speaker 1>risk of really exposing themselves to </v>

191
00:12:08.891 --> 00:12:10.780
<v Speaker 1>the thing that they're afraid of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which basically means,</v>

192
00:12:10.781 --> 00:12:11.614
<v Speaker 1>obviously means to explore it and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>construct a new behavioral pattern as a </v>

193
00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.180
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then they get better.</v>

194
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:17.823
<v Speaker 1>If you're agoraphobic and you're afraid </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a mall and you go to the mall and </v>

195
00:12:20.681 --> 00:12:24.040
<v Speaker 1>your symptoms come up and you run away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that makes your problems worse,</v>

196
00:12:24.041 --> 00:12:24.874
<v Speaker 1>not better.</v>

197
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:25.803
<v Speaker 1>If you go to the mall and your symptoms </v>
<v Speaker 1>come up and you stay there as a </v>

198
00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:30.640
<v Speaker 1>consequence of your own choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your symptoms,</v>

199
00:12:30.641 --> 00:12:33.600
<v Speaker 1>I'll hit a plateau of like an intense </v>
<v Speaker 1>plot help.</v>

200
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.580
<v Speaker 1>It'll be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll deteriorate over time.</v>

201
00:12:35.581 --> 00:12:40.090
<v Speaker 1>And that cures you so well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mrs Mrs and Wesson for again,</v>

202
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.570
<v Speaker 1>I want to point out Freud's eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>improvement.</v>

203
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.130
<v Speaker 1>That's a failed hero myth because need </v>
<v Speaker 1>to put some counters.</v>

204
00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:47.260
<v Speaker 1>He sleeps with his mother in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>screening and assessment,</v>

205
00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:51.400
<v Speaker 1>that's accidental and he blinds himself </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence.</v>

206
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.440
<v Speaker 1>So Friday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that you,</v>

207
00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:55.413
<v Speaker 1>that it's reasonable to make claim that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Freudian psychology is a form of </v>

208
00:12:58.481 --> 00:13:00.820
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's based on a failed hero myth,</v>

209
00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:02.123
<v Speaker 1>which is as opposed to most religions </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have lasted for the time material </v>

210
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.480
<v Speaker 1>always based on successful here are </v>
<v Speaker 1>immense because</v>

211
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.700
<v Speaker 1>successful here wasn't means that </v>
<v Speaker 1>application,</v>

212
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:12.653
<v Speaker 1>if you don't follow that pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll say it again so it's not </v>

213
00:13:15.881 --> 00:13:16.714
<v Speaker 1>successful then in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eatable mint now Friday and well I </v>

214
00:13:21.581 --> 00:13:22.414
<v Speaker 1>don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what necessary conclusions </v>

215
00:13:24.011 --> 00:13:24.844
<v Speaker 1>you can draw from the fact that Freud </v>
<v Speaker 1>kicked the deployment and it's a fail </v>

216
00:13:28.191 --> 00:13:29.024
<v Speaker 1>hero myth.</v>

217
00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.000
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

218
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:34.863
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so because like Freud </v>

219
00:13:36.581 --> 00:13:39.100
<v Speaker 1>thought that the homeowner was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual mother,</v>

220
00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:40.323
<v Speaker 1>but that's often the case for someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who is severity neurotic with let's say </v>

221
00:13:43.211 --> 00:13:44.044
<v Speaker 1>the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that when you Reutemann </v>

222
00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:46.373
<v Speaker 1>started from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from observation and reason and then </v>

223
00:13:49.451 --> 00:13:51.370
<v Speaker 1>using that analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

224
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.353
<v Speaker 1>he didn't start with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't start with the integral mix </v>

225
00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.120
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

226
00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:57.963
<v Speaker 1>he started playing out there on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>implications lives and then just saw in </v>

227
00:14:00.541 --> 00:14:03.420
<v Speaker 1>the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he still said and then saw the,</v>

228
00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:04.413
<v Speaker 1>the mythical stories that seem to map </v>
<v Speaker 1>onto the experiences of the patients </v>

229
00:14:07.331 --> 00:14:08.410
<v Speaker 1>that he saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he did say,</v>

230
00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:10.510
<v Speaker 1>me and me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's the central problem of life,</v>

231
00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.260
<v Speaker 1>that's the central problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

232
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:17.080
<v Speaker 1>and it's universal for Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every culture in every culture,</v>

233
00:14:17.081 --> 00:14:17.914
<v Speaker 1>that's the central problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's been criticized on </v>

234
00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:23.710
<v Speaker 1>anthropological grounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which aren't really relevant here,</v>

235
00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.900
<v Speaker 1>but I still think that it's more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>just</v>

236
00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:28.323
<v Speaker 1>more than just a historical fluke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things or manage themselves that </v>

237
00:14:31.721 --> 00:14:31.810
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

238
00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:35.020
<v Speaker 1>Because he also have to realize that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when Freud and Jung Split,</v>

239
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:36.850
<v Speaker 1>the reason that they split,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

240
00:14:36.851 --> 00:14:37.684
<v Speaker 1>it was on the question of whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion survey and useful function now </v>

241
00:14:41.211 --> 00:14:42.044
<v Speaker 1>on Friday taking a myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that was a myth of failure in a </v>

242
00:14:45.251 --> 00:14:46.990
<v Speaker 1>sense and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's,</v>

243
00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:50.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that goes to the central problem to that</v>

244
00:14:50.141 --> 00:14:50.974
<v Speaker 1>application.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't a premarital sexual aspect </v>

245
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.170
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

246
00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:58.370
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But see the thing about mythologies that</v>

247
00:14:58.371 --> 00:14:59.204
<v Speaker 1>it represent sexual union with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother asked the incest motif and Freud </v>

248
00:15:03.081 --> 00:15:05.360
<v Speaker 1>thought of that as something literal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought,</v>

249
00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:07.293
<v Speaker 1>as Freud tended to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he offered a literal translation of </v>

250
00:15:10.041 --> 00:15:13.220
<v Speaker 1>something that was involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that's actually what it referred</v>

251
00:15:13.221 --> 00:15:14.054
<v Speaker 1>to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was using it as an analogy that he </v>

252
00:15:18.621 --> 00:15:19.454
<v Speaker 1>was taking a more concrete level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is always good in his approach </v>

253
00:15:23.271 --> 00:15:26.640
<v Speaker 1>would be to take the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

254
00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:30.310
<v Speaker 1>to start with the fuel said sectionality</v>
<v Speaker 1>and mythology with symbol.</v>

255
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.610
<v Speaker 1>Freud said symbolism and mythology </v>
<v Speaker 1>resection,</v>

256
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:37.020
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said that</v>

257
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:39.643
<v Speaker 1>symbolism and mythology was sexual and </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewing said that sexual symbolism and </v>

258
00:15:42.921 --> 00:15:45.080
<v Speaker 1>mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sexualities mythology,</v>

259
00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:50.090
<v Speaker 1>the symbol</v>
<v Speaker 1>that floyd was tackling sexual assaulted</v>

260
00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:55.770
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

261
00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:57.230
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again though,</v>

262
00:15:57.231 --> 00:16:00.140
<v Speaker 1>that's not precisely true because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

263
00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:03.110
<v Speaker 1>it was for Freud in the Victorian </v>
<v Speaker 1>patients that he encountered,</v>

264
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:05.390
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality was problematic because it was</v>

265
00:16:05.391 --> 00:16:06.224
<v Speaker 1>contaminated with a no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't problematic because of his </v>

266
00:16:09.141 --> 00:16:09.974
<v Speaker 1>sexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was problematic because it was </v>

267
00:16:12.951 --> 00:16:13.784
<v Speaker 1>unexplored territory and unexplored </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory for the Victorian neurotics </v>

268
00:16:17.001 --> 00:16:18.950
<v Speaker 1>half of the primary and sexual in </v>
<v Speaker 1>origin.</v>

269
00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:22.580
<v Speaker 1>So he saw a sexuality as the presenting </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

270
00:16:22.581 --> 00:16:23.414
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was unexplored territory if it was </v>

271
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:27.820
<v Speaker 1>any problem in the guise of sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>dysfunction.</v>

272
00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:28.893
<v Speaker 1>I explored territory in the consulting </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it comes in all sorts of forums </v>

273
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:35.390
<v Speaker 1>and it might come in the form of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unresolved relationship with your mother</v>

274
00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.673
<v Speaker 1>who is a form of God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak when you're a child and you </v>

275
00:16:38.991 --> 00:16:39.824
<v Speaker 1>can say that for the struggling neurotic</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that this is a person who has a </v>

276
00:16:42.201 --> 00:16:43.820
<v Speaker 1>dependent personality disorder.</v>

277
00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:49.160
<v Speaker 1>There is struggle with the parental </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation is an analog of the process of</v>

278
00:16:49.161 --> 00:16:51.620
<v Speaker 1>adaptation in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the parents,</v>

279
00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:58.690
<v Speaker 1>when you're 25 30 your parents should no</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer be parents.</v>

280
00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:00.493
<v Speaker 1>They should be other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should be other people who you've </v>

281
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.260
<v Speaker 1>had an intense relationship with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who are other people?</v>

282
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:08.720
<v Speaker 1>Your parents should be someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By that point,</v>

283
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:10.063
<v Speaker 1>if your parents are still your parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the battle you should be playing </v>

284
00:17:13.101 --> 00:17:13.934
<v Speaker 1>out in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still being played out for you and </v>

285
00:17:15.831 --> 00:17:19.400
<v Speaker 1>your family and Freud's neurotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>patients were like that.</v>

286
00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:20.890
<v Speaker 1>They never got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never made it.</v>

287
00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.193
<v Speaker 1>They never made it of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never made it to here much less to </v>

288
00:17:24.981 --> 00:17:26.110
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

289
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:28.100
<v Speaker 1>they were still struggling with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

290
00:17:28.101 --> 00:17:28.934
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I deal with the childhood </v>

291
00:17:29.901 --> 00:17:30.734
<v Speaker 1>environment?</v>

292
00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:35.570
<v Speaker 1>The thing is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

293
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:36.833
<v Speaker 1>the</v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptation to what we're talking about </v>

294
00:17:39.081 --> 00:17:39.914
<v Speaker 1>here is as it certainly seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>appraised and our most fundamental </v>

295
00:17:43.431 --> 00:17:47.540
<v Speaker 1>biological systems than any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any concept,</v>

296
00:17:47.541 --> 00:17:49.040
<v Speaker 1>any story that you're used to talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

297
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Because on some level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right to talking about the same thing.</v>

298
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:52.973
<v Speaker 1>So in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course they were talking about the </v>

299
00:17:54.871 --> 00:17:57.930
<v Speaker 1>same thing they're talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most basic,</v>

300
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

301
00:17:58.980 --> 00:17:59.620
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

302
00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.900
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good comment.</v>

303
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:01.903
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is one of the characteristics of </v>

304
00:18:04.411 --> 00:18:09.411
<v Speaker 1>stories that Freud cold calls</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that his story is meaningful on</v>

305
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.960
<v Speaker 1>multiple levels simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a good,</v>

306
00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:20.580
<v Speaker 1>that's a perfectly good introduction to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next diagram here.</v>

307
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:22.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember though,</v>

308
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:27.390
<v Speaker 1>the old diagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see the analogies here.</v>

309
00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.820
<v Speaker 1>You know which one I talked?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

310
00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So before what we had,</v>

311
00:18:34.321 --> 00:18:35.760
<v Speaker 1>we were a bunch of arrows here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

312
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:42.360
<v Speaker 1>This being the ends and these being the </v>
<v Speaker 1>means to get there.</v>

313
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.393
<v Speaker 1>But that's not a sufficient way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the problem and since you </v>

314
00:18:47.131 --> 00:18:48.770
<v Speaker 1>already have mastered that way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at it,</v>

315
00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:49.613
<v Speaker 1>so we'll introduce more difficult level </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that level is that all the ways of </v>

316
00:18:54.811 --> 00:18:59.160
<v Speaker 1>getting to an Anne are also structures </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are like the whole structure,</v>

317
00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.850
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that when you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

318
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:03.743
<v Speaker 1>when you engaged in any activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're engaged in a whole nested </v>

319
00:19:07.441 --> 00:19:08.274
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy of goal directed behavior and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the NASA thing goes all the way down to </v>

320
00:19:12.241 --> 00:19:17.241
<v Speaker 1>the lowest level of analysis and all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way up to so a kind of Maine,</v>

321
00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:18.203
<v Speaker 1>how do you construe this while you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting in this class and you have a </v>

322
00:19:21.271 --> 00:19:23.610
<v Speaker 1>certain year and trying to attain </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain goals in,</v>

323
00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:24.773
<v Speaker 1>in just this lecture and this lectures </v>
<v Speaker 1>nasty in this class and this class is </v>

324
00:19:28.591 --> 00:19:29.424
<v Speaker 1>nested in your educational curriculum </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your educational curriculum is </v>

325
00:19:33.001 --> 00:19:33.834
<v Speaker 1>nested in your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your career goals and your career </v>

326
00:19:36.721 --> 00:19:39.800
<v Speaker 1>goals of nested in your culture and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture is to then,</v>

327
00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:42.000
<v Speaker 1>well then it gets a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>

328
00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:43.750
<v Speaker 1>What's your culture has to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

329
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.720
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's nested in religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions.</v>

330
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:49.220
<v Speaker 1>What do they nested parts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an estimate,</v>

331
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.710
<v Speaker 1>philosophical presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then in religious presuppositions,</v>

332
00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:56.050
<v Speaker 1>then in behavioral place up positions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so on.</v>

333
00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Knows how far and also down how far and </v>
<v Speaker 1>even within the domain of the class,</v>

334
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:03.743
<v Speaker 1>the single lecture while you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything in particular that's a subgoal </v>

335
00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:08.283
<v Speaker 1>tenacity inside of the class like you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking notes because this point has </v>

336
00:20:11.701 --> 00:20:13.680
<v Speaker 1>relevance at different levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>

337
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:15.143
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of procedures that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>undertaking as the class continues </v>

338
00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:23.490
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's different ways of thinking.</v>

339
00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:24.353
<v Speaker 1>This is vague by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be a vague lecture </v>

340
00:20:25.861 --> 00:20:27.630
<v Speaker 1>because some of the things that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

341
00:20:27.631 --> 00:20:28.464
<v Speaker 1>you talking with you about today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to figure out because there </v>

342
00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:34.420
<v Speaker 1>was some errors in my original </v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions.</v>

343
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:35.303
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to clear them up so if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have any comments that you think are </v>

344
00:20:37.981 --> 00:20:38.814
<v Speaker 1>particularly insightful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be more than happy to hear them say </v>

345
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.033
<v Speaker 1>you can think of this as a corporate </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure to the whole corporations </v>

346
00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:48.723
<v Speaker 1>going off to do something and these </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be vice presidents sort of </v>

347
00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:56.800
<v Speaker 1>equivalent status and then each vice </v>
<v Speaker 1>president would occupy a domain.</v>

348
00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.740
<v Speaker 1>He has underlings and they have their </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular story to,</v>

349
00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:00.983
<v Speaker 1>to act out in the domain of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation and they govern some other </v>

350
00:21:04.811 --> 00:21:05.644
<v Speaker 1>people and so on and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way down to the bottom level of </v>

351
00:21:07.451 --> 00:21:09.520
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even a thing like the corporation.</v>

352
00:21:09.521 --> 00:21:11.560
<v Speaker 1>If you think of this as a corporation or</v>
<v Speaker 1>any other,</v>

353
00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:14.590
<v Speaker 1>any other structure for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

354
00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.190
<v Speaker 1>corporations are nested inside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>political structure that's nested inside</v>

355
00:21:18.191 --> 00:21:22.180
<v Speaker 1>it philosophical structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why people pay.</v>

356
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Businessmen are generally advocates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least at least explicitly of the free</v>

357
00:21:28.691 --> 00:21:29.524
<v Speaker 1>market because their whole story only </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintains its validity within the </v>

358
00:21:35.591 --> 00:21:39.430
<v Speaker 1>context of a whole network of </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical presuppositions.</v>

359
00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:40.923
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

360
00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.350
<v Speaker 1>and that's the case at every single </v>
<v Speaker 1>level of analysis.</v>

361
00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:47.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess part of what we're interested in</v>

362
00:21:47.051 --> 00:21:49.180
<v Speaker 1>is like what's at the highest level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis,</v>

363
00:21:49.181 --> 00:21:50.950
<v Speaker 1>what's out there at the edge.</v>

364
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:52.503
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to ask you if you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>point out where you making corrections </v>

365
00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:56.830
<v Speaker 1>as we go along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If one,</v>

366
00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:57.963
<v Speaker 1>when you said you were going to make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said this would be a little vague </v>

367
00:21:59.561 --> 00:22:00.394
<v Speaker 1>because there's some mechanism </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrections and measured and there's </v>

368
00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:02.501
<v Speaker 1>only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

369
00:22:02.501 --> 00:22:03.334
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is slightly different than what </v>

370
00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:07.960
<v Speaker 1>we're basically did it with chapter four</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

371
00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.050
<v Speaker 1>The idea is not necessarily different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but diagrams.</v>

372
00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:12.793
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still [inaudible] I'm still in the </v>

373
00:22:14.081 --> 00:22:15.730
<v Speaker 1>same ballpark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to,</v>

374
00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:18.100
<v Speaker 1>this is still the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there was any</v>

375
00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:27.730
<v Speaker 1>breast</v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

376
00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:38.500
<v Speaker 1>behavioral story are at odds and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're neurotic.</v>

377
00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:40.173
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

378
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.931
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

379
00:22:40.931 --> 00:22:41.764
<v Speaker 1>it has to be hierarchical and all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to be subjugated to ask the </v>

380
00:22:45.011 --> 00:22:46.870
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it have to be subjugated to?</v>

381
00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:50.760
<v Speaker 1>That's why I put this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this diagram up.</v>

382
00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:56.763
<v Speaker 1>Well look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be lots of situations </v>

383
00:22:57.941 --> 00:22:58.774
<v Speaker 1>where you can have a story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a story B and they're going along in </v>

384
00:23:01.001 --> 00:23:02.800
<v Speaker 1>parallel and there's no problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>

385
00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Just like there are lots of cases where </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

386
00:23:05.171 --> 00:23:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Asian culture be occupied in the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory more or less,</v>

387
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.730
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then now and then a historical event</v>

388
00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:12.453
<v Speaker 1>and that event points out those areas </v>
<v Speaker 1>where those two parallel stories </v>

389
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:21.700
<v Speaker 1>actually conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So look,</v>

390
00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.900
<v Speaker 1>for a most of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of us Westerners so to speak,</v>

391
00:23:25.901 --> 00:23:29.560
<v Speaker 1>are the educated population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a conflict for us,</v>

392
00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:30.483
<v Speaker 1>I think between how we act and our moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions and how we conceive of </v>

393
00:23:34.241 --> 00:23:36.130
<v Speaker 1>the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From the scientific perspective,</v>

394
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:38.170
<v Speaker 1>it's a big conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

395
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:40.090
<v Speaker 1>most of the time it doesn't make any </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference,</v>

396
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:42.550
<v Speaker 1>but now and then it makes a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

397
00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:44.670
<v Speaker 1>And in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we only,</v>

398
00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.513
<v Speaker 1>when you say that someone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologically integrated or when you </v>

399
00:23:48.801 --> 00:23:49.634
<v Speaker 1>say someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see someone who has an </v>

400
00:23:51.291 --> 00:23:54.020
<v Speaker 1>impeccable character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might mean I'm looking at it.</v>

401
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:55.183
<v Speaker 1>What you see is the fact that all their </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories take one story because they're </v>

402
00:23:58.011 --> 00:23:58.844
<v Speaker 1>not working at cross purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can be offering different </v>

403
00:24:01.171 --> 00:24:02.004
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

404
00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>superstructure,</v>

405
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:09.260
<v Speaker 1>if you're an integrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a superstructure</v>

406
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:11.833
<v Speaker 1>that I think is relatively explicit to </v>
<v Speaker 1>which all your other brands are made </v>

407
00:24:14.721 --> 00:24:16.270
<v Speaker 1>subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the credit.</v>

408
00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:18.530
<v Speaker 1>And then the question is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutes the king?</v>

409
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.620
<v Speaker 1>You could look at this at Lawrence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different levels of analysis.</v>

410
00:24:21.621 --> 00:24:22.191
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

411
00:24:22.191 --> 00:24:23.024
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all your different motivational </v>

412
00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:27.830
<v Speaker 1>subsystems have to operate in harmony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

413
00:24:27.831 --> 00:24:30.530
<v Speaker 1>So each of them has to take all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>others into account.</v>

414
00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:32.600
<v Speaker 1>The vice presidents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

415
00:24:32.601 --> 00:24:34.160
<v Speaker 1>that might be one way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

416
00:24:34.161 --> 00:24:34.994
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking more in intro psyche and </v>

417
00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:39.320
<v Speaker 1>speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to eat,</v>

418
00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:43.130
<v Speaker 1>you have to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need social contact,</v>

419
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:44.270
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

420
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.700
<v Speaker 1>There's all these basic preconditions </v>
<v Speaker 1>for your existence that have to be mad,</v>

421
00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:49.453
<v Speaker 1>all of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have specialized biological </v>

422
00:24:51.471 --> 00:24:52.304
<v Speaker 1>subsystems that are responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>ensuring that one of those particular </v>

423
00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:00.830
<v Speaker 1>needs is math and the way those systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>ensure that is by,</v>

424
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:06.310
<v Speaker 1>I think by gripping your fantasy when </v>
<v Speaker 1>something within you is out of kilter.</v>

425
00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.020
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in this class,</v>

426
00:25:09.021 --> 00:25:09.854
<v Speaker 1>you have need for five hours while I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking intrusive thoughts about what </v>

427
00:25:14.151 --> 00:25:14.984
<v Speaker 1>you might need afterwards are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pop into the theater of your mind </v>

428
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:22.130
<v Speaker 1>because that's the subsystem that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for maintaining your caloric</v>

429
00:25:22.131 --> 00:25:27.131
<v Speaker 1>intake is not being satisfied by your </v>
<v Speaker 1>current state of goal directed activity.</v>

430
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:28.963
<v Speaker 1>Your job to adapt is to organize all </v>
<v Speaker 1>those motivational subsystems into a </v>

431
00:25:34.401 --> 00:25:39.401
<v Speaker 1>unit such that none of them conflict and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that all of the more towards the same</v>

432
00:25:39.711 --> 00:25:44.060
<v Speaker 1>man so that all of them get what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>need.</v>

433
00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:45.613
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also paying attention to the fact that </v>

434
00:25:47.571 --> 00:25:50.780
<v Speaker 1>every other one gets what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

435
00:25:50.781 --> 00:25:54.200
<v Speaker 1>the same thing exactly can be said about</v>
<v Speaker 1>your relationships with other people,</v>

436
00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:59.300
<v Speaker 1>because you could say just as you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to take all of your needs into account,</v>

437
00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:01.183
<v Speaker 1>you're operating in a social environment</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to take all your needs into account </v>

438
00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:05.533
<v Speaker 1>also means to take into account the </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs of everyone that you come into </v>

439
00:26:07.341 --> 00:26:08.174
<v Speaker 1>contact with.</v>

440
00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:10.400
<v Speaker 1>So it's also the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

441
00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:13.520
<v Speaker 1>it is the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even that when you're trying to modulate</v>

442
00:26:13.521 --> 00:26:14.354
<v Speaker 1>the environment so that you get what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to get a lot of the environment </v>

443
00:26:17.091 --> 00:26:17.924
<v Speaker 1>that you're modulating his other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a nice amorphism between the </v>

444
00:26:21.951 --> 00:26:22.784
<v Speaker 1>way you construct your internal </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and the way that the social </v>

445
00:26:26.061 --> 00:26:27.540
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was constructed,</v>

446
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:30.740
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary isomorphism networks all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way up.</v>

447
00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:32.750
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mesopotamians,</v>

448
00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:35.660
<v Speaker 1>they asked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they asked the question,</v>

449
00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:39.230
<v Speaker 1>who should be king?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on the mythical level,</v>

450
00:26:39.231 --> 00:26:41.240
<v Speaker 1>that means who should determine </v>
<v Speaker 1>destinies.</v>

451
00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:43.350
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is how it should </v>
<v Speaker 1>behave.</v>

452
00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.920
<v Speaker 1>They're operating under what ages and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Enuma Elish,</v>

453
00:26:46.921 --> 00:26:47.754
<v Speaker 1>which is their creation story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says all gods should be subordinate to </v>

454
00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:53.110
<v Speaker 1>Martech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martech,</v>

455
00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:55.740
<v Speaker 1>the garden goes up to the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creates the world,</v>

456
00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:59.040
<v Speaker 1>and that's what this diagram is about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

457
00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:01.760
<v Speaker 1>That's your group identification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a provision,</v>

458
00:27:01.761 --> 00:27:04.920
<v Speaker 1>lance to the problem with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptation question is though,</v>

459
00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:08.880
<v Speaker 1>what should everything be subordinate to</v>
<v Speaker 1>including your group?</v>

460
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:09.713
<v Speaker 1>I think medication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is your particular solution to </v>

461
00:27:11.281 --> 00:27:12.114
<v Speaker 1>your motivation problems on that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything should be subordinate to the </v>

462
00:27:15.271 --> 00:27:16.104
<v Speaker 1>process that generates new inflammation </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the encounter with them and </v>

463
00:27:19.621 --> 00:27:23.460
<v Speaker 1>updates known territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>

464
00:27:23.461 --> 00:27:26.280
<v Speaker 1>So then to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get right back to your question,</v>

465
00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:31.760
<v Speaker 1>all your stories should be arranged in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy such that the highest story,</v>

466
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:33.713
<v Speaker 1>his allegiance with the process that </v>
<v Speaker 1>engages in creative contact with the </v>

467
00:27:37.531 --> 00:27:41.070
<v Speaker 1>unknown and to the degree that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not the case,</v>

468
00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:45.990
<v Speaker 1>then you've deviated from the path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

469
00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:48.360
<v Speaker 1>there's another new testaments during </v>
<v Speaker 1>their crisis,</v>

470
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:51.900
<v Speaker 1>it's more theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's driving on a cart with the rich man</v>

471
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:53.423
<v Speaker 1>and rich man says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I have to do to get into heaven </v>

472
00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:57.750
<v Speaker 1>and crisis?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to sell everything you own.</v>

473
00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:01.110
<v Speaker 1>And all the disciples that are just </v>
<v Speaker 1>flabbergasted by this,</v>

474
00:28:01.111 --> 00:28:01.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't like this.</v>

475
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:02.783
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

476
00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:05.130
<v Speaker 1>if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no hope.</v>

477
00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.530
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course,</v>

478
00:28:07.531 --> 00:28:08.364
<v Speaker 1>as well as easier for account and go </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the avenue in which men and </v>

479
00:28:11.221 --> 00:28:14.340
<v Speaker 1>they're having now the reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has nothing to do with money.</v>

480
00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.213
<v Speaker 1>It has nothing to do with money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to do with the relative </v>

481
00:28:18.181 --> 00:28:19.800
<v Speaker 1>importance of goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

482
00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:23.100
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this young guy is so preoccupied</v>

483
00:28:23.101 --> 00:28:26.490
<v Speaker 1>with this wealth and maintaining it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is this,</v>

484
00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:30.863
<v Speaker 1>but he won't risk this to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so all that that story is pointing </v>

485
00:28:35.491 --> 00:28:38.610
<v Speaker 1>out is that if you want this and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't risk this to do this,</v>

486
00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:42.900
<v Speaker 1>then you don't get this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what you really want.</v>

487
00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:46.320
<v Speaker 1>Even though you don't know it's your </v>
<v Speaker 1>money is just a proxy for that.</v>

488
00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:47.700
<v Speaker 1>It's false security.</v>

489
00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:52.720
<v Speaker 3>There's a copy machine right outside the</v>
<v Speaker 3>door for one second.</v>

490
00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:56.280
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we could write notes on it.</v>

491
00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:03.540
<v Speaker 3>Would you consider that?</v>

492
00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

493
00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

494
00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:13.900
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that need cheap ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>late 18 hundreds was our,</v>

495
00:29:13.901 --> 00:29:17.950
<v Speaker 1>their neurosis of health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by that he meant can you be properly</v>

496
00:29:17.951 --> 00:29:20.680
<v Speaker 1>adopted to pathological circumstance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]?</v>

497
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:21.543
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you say crime of </v>

498
00:29:23.651 --> 00:29:24.484
<v Speaker 1>obedience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you say is adherence to this and </v>

499
00:29:27.741 --> 00:29:28.574
<v Speaker 1>the sacrifice of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why most people are a little bit </v>

500
00:29:30.491 --> 00:29:32.200
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

501
00:29:32.201 --> 00:29:34.060
<v Speaker 1>it's also looked like it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

502
00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:37.630
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that the 20th century </v>
<v Speaker 1>is having struggle with is the notion of</v>

503
00:29:37.631 --> 00:29:38.464
<v Speaker 1>crimes against humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right because the Nazi would say </v>

504
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:43.720
<v Speaker 1>and and accurately would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

505
00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:48.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm a trivial individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just doing my job.</v>

506
00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:52.240
<v Speaker 1>I was following orders that move down </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy.</v>

507
00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:54.960
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't my responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

508
00:29:54.961 --> 00:29:57.190
<v Speaker 1>Normally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only was it not my responsibility,</v>

509
00:29:57.191 --> 00:29:59.050
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't doing what I should have </v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

510
00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.161
<v Speaker 1>And you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

511
00:30:00.161 --> 00:30:02.350
<v Speaker 1>those people were just rationalizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>their behavior.</v>

512
00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:03.423
<v Speaker 1>But the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they're making a valid </v>

513
00:30:04.781 --> 00:30:07.270
<v Speaker 1>statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the Nuremberg trial says,</v>

514
00:30:07.271 --> 00:30:10.660
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for reasons we don't understand,</v>

515
00:30:10.661 --> 00:30:13.570
<v Speaker 1>which is to say for for reasons we can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>make explicit,</v>

516
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:17.200
<v Speaker 1>there are certain rules you can break </v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're,</v>

517
00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:23.770
<v Speaker 1>even if you're morally operate from this</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

518
00:30:23.771 --> 00:30:26.230
<v Speaker 1>which is to say there's certain rbc you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't fall.</v>

519
00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.060
<v Speaker 1>I think that's tough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

520
00:30:28.061 --> 00:30:28.894
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're a soldier in the war </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and your commander say three or </v>

521
00:30:31.631 --> 00:30:33.940
<v Speaker 1>four levels of hierarchy up says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

522
00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:36.790
<v Speaker 1>shoot these villagers and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot them,</v>

523
00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:41.170
<v Speaker 1>your dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the number of Charles says,</v>

524
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:43.990
<v Speaker 1>tough luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically there are,</v>

525
00:30:43.991 --> 00:30:46.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are certain orders you can't fall.</v>

526
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.300
<v Speaker 1>And then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

527
00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:51.430
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are certain orders you can fall.</v>

528
00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:52.593
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means that there's something outside </v>

529
00:30:54.131 --> 00:30:54.964
<v Speaker 1>of what you can define explicitly or </v>
<v Speaker 1>what your culture is defined explicitly </v>

530
00:30:57.281 --> 00:30:59.020
<v Speaker 1>or it doesn't mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

531
00:30:59.021 --> 00:31:01.120
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crime against humanity,</v>

532
00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.313
<v Speaker 1>this is the definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do what this says instead of what </v>

533
00:31:05.411 --> 00:31:08.680
<v Speaker 1>this says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the definition.</v>

534
00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:13.750
<v Speaker 4>Perhaps it just means that to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you</v>

535
00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:16.293
<v Speaker 4>realize,</v>

536
00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.000
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the in the tire,</v>

537
00:31:21.001 --> 00:31:23.260
<v Speaker 1>which would be the person who gave you </v>
<v Speaker 1>the order?</v>

538
00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.193
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the first one it tells you that you </v>

539
00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:28.360
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't well enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know why.</v>

540
00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.350
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I like I,</v>

541
00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:33.293
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think that the Nuremberg trials </v>

542
00:31:35.681 --> 00:31:36.514
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that it's reasonable to </v>

543
00:31:38.651 --> 00:31:41.980
<v Speaker 1>construe them as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the response of one tire need to,</v>

544
00:31:41.981 --> 00:31:43.940
<v Speaker 1>the excesses of enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

545
00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:47.140
<v Speaker 1>I think there's more to it than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though you know,</v>

546
00:31:47.141 --> 00:31:48.610
<v Speaker 1>for the person who's caught in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle,</v>

547
00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:51.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're in trouble or it looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>

548
00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:53.390
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

549
00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:55.160
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you go?</v>

550
00:31:58.850 --> 00:31:59.683
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the whole last half of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>course just because that's what I'm </v>

551
00:32:02.571 --> 00:32:05.420
<v Speaker 1>interested in is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of these isoboards isms exist.</v>

552
00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:09.170
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the simple answer to that is that your,</v>

553
00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:10.603
<v Speaker 1>your personal response to anomalous </v>
<v Speaker 1>information in a way that's not trivial </v>

554
00:32:14.511 --> 00:32:17.680
<v Speaker 1>determines the course of your culture in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a way that like,</v>

555
00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:18.553
<v Speaker 1>which seems complete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems like a completely ridiculous </v>

556
00:32:19.971 --> 00:32:20.400
<v Speaker 1>statement,</v>

557
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.800
<v Speaker 4>but</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still think it's true.</v>

558
00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:25.083
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

559
00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:26.563
<v Speaker 1>culture that's made up of people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>take the character logically negative </v>

560
00:32:31.281 --> 00:32:33.100
<v Speaker 1>stairs towards it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>homeless information back.</v>

561
00:32:33.101 --> 00:32:33.934
<v Speaker 1>So that's a fascist state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why well thing about a fascist </v>

562
00:32:38.241 --> 00:32:39.770
<v Speaker 1>state and Scott,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the structure,</v>

563
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:41.203
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to remember that our current </v>

564
00:32:44.391 --> 00:32:46.730
<v Speaker 1>states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our bodies of law,</v>

565
00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:47.863
<v Speaker 1>which means they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're explicit descriptions of </v>

566
00:32:50.661 --> 00:32:55.050
<v Speaker 1>behavioral patterns that when put into </v>
<v Speaker 1>operation are actually embodied.</v>

567
00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:59.300
<v Speaker 1>It's right there rules about how to act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say what a state is,</v>

568
00:32:59.301 --> 00:33:02.120
<v Speaker 1>is this is a description of an ideal </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

569
00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:05.420
<v Speaker 1>All the laws in this state constitute </v>
<v Speaker 1>the description of an ideal personality.</v>

570
00:33:05.421 --> 00:33:09.740
<v Speaker 1>Because what the law says is at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do this.</v>

571
00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.800
<v Speaker 1>So in this it defining is what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be by exclusion,</v>

572
00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:15.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all those things that you can do,</v>

573
00:33:15.631 --> 00:33:16.464
<v Speaker 1>well that makes up the ideal citizen and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone who's the member of the same </v>

574
00:33:20.091 --> 00:33:23.060
<v Speaker 1>culture is a duplicate of that ideal </v>
<v Speaker 1>citizen.</v>

575
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:26.330
<v Speaker 1>So then the question again is what's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal citizen?</v>

576
00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.570
<v Speaker 1>And someone who's bureaucratically and </v>
<v Speaker 1>client will say,</v>

577
00:33:29.571 --> 00:33:30.404
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideal citizen does exactly what the </v>

578
00:33:32.271 --> 00:33:35.360
<v Speaker 1>hell you tell him to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that makes everyone predictable.</v>

579
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:40.340
<v Speaker 1>But then there's this leap above that </v>
<v Speaker 1>morality which says,</v>

580
00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:41.020
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

581
00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:45.950
<v Speaker 1>the ideal citizen knows what to do and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what not to do according to the rules.</v>

582
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:51.310
<v Speaker 1>But when the circumstances change</v>
<v Speaker 1>or when the circumstances call for it,</v>

583
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:53.803
<v Speaker 1>then there's another morality that </v>
<v Speaker 1>supersedes the group identity on upon </v>

584
00:33:58.311 --> 00:34:01.160
<v Speaker 1>which group structure is necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain.</v>

585
00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.113
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that's so interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been the harder you try to ensure </v>

586
00:34:05.121 --> 00:34:05.954
<v Speaker 1>that these boundaries are impermeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more likely you are to kill </v>

587
00:34:08.811 --> 00:34:10.010
<v Speaker 1>everything that's inside here.</v>

588
00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:13.663
<v Speaker 4>Just</v>
<v Speaker 4>social around the identity was the </v>

589
00:34:18.071 --> 00:34:21.940
<v Speaker 4>hardest question for anyone who is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what should I do?</v>

590
00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.740
<v Speaker 4>That's what so is it through the goal?</v>

591
00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:25.381
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

592
00:34:25.381 --> 00:34:26.240
<v Speaker 1>That's sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

593
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:27.833
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do not want to ever make the mistake </v>

594
00:34:30.241 --> 00:34:34.350
<v Speaker 1>of presuming that there are tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantages to staying inside here.</v>

595
00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no anomaly.</v>

596
00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:37.290
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the problem?</v>

597
00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:38.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no interest.</v>

598
00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:42.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean because if you are by definition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you exclude novelty,</v>

599
00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.193
<v Speaker 1>you exclude incentive reward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is that you get </v>

600
00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:51.390
<v Speaker 1>protection at the cost of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all the interest in life.</v>

601
00:34:51.391 --> 00:34:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Now what this alternative route says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

602
00:34:53.971 --> 00:34:56.820
<v Speaker 1>if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you face the anomalous information,</v>

603
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:58.820
<v Speaker 1>there's enough interest generating </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

604
00:34:58.830 --> 00:34:59.663
<v Speaker 1>which is enough hope so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that in itself will provide a </v>

605
00:35:03.271 --> 00:35:06.360
<v Speaker 1>barrier against all of the negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>potentialities.</v>

606
00:35:06.361 --> 00:35:08.250
<v Speaker 1>They don't occur as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing this,</v>

607
00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:11.640
<v Speaker 1>which is to say if you're willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take the leap outside,</v>

608
00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:13.403
<v Speaker 1>there are phenomena that you will </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter there that will protect you </v>

609
00:35:15.781 --> 00:35:17.550
<v Speaker 1>from all the negative things that you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>encountered.</v>

610
00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:22.890
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is predictable but sterile.</v>

611
00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:26.400
<v Speaker 1>That's why mythology and it kingdom </v>
<v Speaker 1>ruled by a tire and everything dries up,</v>

612
00:35:26.401 --> 00:35:27.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The river's disappeared,</v>

613
00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.930
<v Speaker 1>the trees died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grass dies.</v>

614
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:30.103
<v Speaker 1>Everything's dad and everything's old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as you just pointed out with the </v>

615
00:35:31.771 --> 00:35:33.450
<v Speaker 1>Nuremberg trials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not necessarily true.</v>

616
00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:34.313
<v Speaker 1>You jump outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're quite likely to end up dead </v>

617
00:35:36.001 --> 00:35:37.200
<v Speaker 1>depending on what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

618
00:35:37.201 --> 00:35:38.034
<v Speaker 1>on how strong the of the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to learn bird didn't jump </v>

619
00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:41.760
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

620
00:35:41.761 --> 00:35:42.594
<v Speaker 1>but I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was referring back to the elephant is </v>

621
00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:48.050
<v Speaker 1>the fascist state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were discussing the person,</v>

622
00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:51.930
<v Speaker 1>if someone four or five levels up orders</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to kill these villagers.</v>

623
00:35:51.931 --> 00:35:53.220
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't do it,</v>

624
00:35:53.221 --> 00:35:54.390
<v Speaker 1>you're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

625
00:35:54.391 --> 00:35:55.224
<v Speaker 1>and that's joe and that's jumping out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have to read the second volume of </v>

626
00:35:57.661 --> 00:35:58.494
<v Speaker 1>the Gulag archipelago because that </v>
<v Speaker 1>answers that question and there's no </v>

627
00:36:02.011 --> 00:36:02.940
<v Speaker 1>simple answer to it.</v>

628
00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:06.630
<v Speaker 1>So because let's say if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>start the book,</v>

629
00:36:06.631 --> 00:36:07.464
<v Speaker 1>there's a chapter at the end which you </v>
<v Speaker 1>protein in the personality texted last </v>

630
00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:10.943
<v Speaker 1>year called the soul and barb wire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is exactly the issue that </v>

631
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:14.263
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn discusses that says when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the price for stepping outside of his </v>

632
00:36:17.761 --> 00:36:18.594
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what?</v>

633
00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:22.230
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Read the book because it's the only,</v>

634
00:36:22.231 --> 00:36:23.064
<v Speaker 1>it's the only book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that there have been other books </v>

635
00:36:25.351 --> 00:36:28.790
<v Speaker 1>written like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he really address either,</v>

636
00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:29.803
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either you die or you or you stay in </v>

637
00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:33.670
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

638
00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:40.380
<v Speaker 1>well is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily because the thing is the</v>

639
00:36:40.381 --> 00:36:43.680
<v Speaker 1>threats for stepping outside their real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like this,</v>

640
00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:47.280
<v Speaker 1>this chaos might've been death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a real thing.</v>

641
00:36:47.281 --> 00:36:48.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just the,</v>

642
00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:51.300
<v Speaker 1>it's not just a circle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

643
00:36:51.301 --> 00:36:53.440
<v Speaker 1>It's fun just to see a glow in the mall </v>
<v Speaker 1>might kill.</v>

644
00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:55.903
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people get depressed and then they </v>

645
00:36:57.151 --> 00:36:58.510
<v Speaker 1>should themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

646
00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:02.670
<v Speaker 1>it's like this is really dangerous and </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that might have to use</v>

647
00:37:02.671 --> 00:37:03.504
<v Speaker 1>might get killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why in one of the standard </v>

648
00:37:06.241 --> 00:37:09.990
<v Speaker 1>features of a hero mythology is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative encounter with the group,</v>

649
00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quality in the New Testament story of,</v>

650
00:37:12.031 --> 00:37:15.680
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ is exposed to this appears all,</v>

651
00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:16.920
<v Speaker 1>all who've said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill him.</v>

652
00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.070
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the price for stepping </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside,</v>

653
00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:24.210
<v Speaker 1>even though theoretically he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the embodiment of the process.</v>

654
00:37:24.211 --> 00:37:29.100
<v Speaker 1>That revitalizes group last week you </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked a little bit about the MTA,</v>

655
00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:33.091
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

656
00:37:33.091 --> 00:37:34.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what this is trying to represent.</v>

657
00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:40.110
<v Speaker 1>What's the motivation for fronting that </v>
<v Speaker 1>much?</v>

658
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:48.550
<v Speaker 1>What is it</v>
<v Speaker 1>that motivates someone to step two?</v>

659
00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:50.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

660
00:37:50.971 --> 00:37:53.340
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's anomalous information here full.</v>

661
00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:58.360
<v Speaker 1>I see it's full of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why don't characterize it</v>

662
00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.700
<v Speaker 1>motivates a movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

663
00:38:05.701 --> 00:38:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

664
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:07.223
<v Speaker 1>the simple answer to that was faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that human said that </v>

665
00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:11.163
<v Speaker 1>was useful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the voter religious tradition and the </v>

666
00:38:12.241 --> 00:38:14.070
<v Speaker 1>use of religious traditions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy,</v>

667
00:38:14.071 --> 00:38:14.904
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If prior to the dawn of empirical </v>

668
00:38:17.821 --> 00:38:19.970
<v Speaker 1>medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

669
00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:21.333
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural,</v>

670
00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medical personality,</v>

671
00:38:23.761 --> 00:38:24.594
<v Speaker 1>if you were suffering from a particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>disease would tell you a story about a </v>

672
00:38:30.001 --> 00:38:35.001
<v Speaker 1>god who had the same problem and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythical participation in the adventures</v>

673
00:38:37.541 --> 00:38:40.810
<v Speaker 1>of that God would constitute and </v>
<v Speaker 1>curative ritual.</v>

674
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:43.810
<v Speaker 1>Some of these rituals are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very elaborate.</v>

675
00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:45.273
<v Speaker 1>Now you could say that the purpose of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion in the sense is to provide you </v>

676
00:38:49.511 --> 00:38:50.344
<v Speaker 1>with a body of images that describes how</v>
<v Speaker 1>this process works and then points out </v>

677
00:38:56.231 --> 00:38:57.064
<v Speaker 1>in the sense that there's a light at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>end of the tunnel and it's like </v>

678
00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:00.903
<v Speaker 1>identification with that image can sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of provide a barrier against all the </v>

679
00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:06.970
<v Speaker 1>chaos that's outside of the group.</v>

680
00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:12.430
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I identification with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>central figure of a given religion.</v>

681
00:39:12.431 --> 00:39:14.700
<v Speaker 1>That's what that's supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

682
00:39:14.701 --> 00:39:16.090
<v Speaker 1>it's almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

683
00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:20.890
<v Speaker 1>here's an example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vampire movie vampires hate crosses,</v>

684
00:39:20.891 --> 00:39:21.724
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a vampire is a symbol of the </v>

685
00:39:23.771 --> 00:39:24.604
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some sexual contamination there </v>

686
00:39:25.931 --> 00:39:28.960
<v Speaker 1>as a general rule too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a night creature.</v>

687
00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:34.310
<v Speaker 1>The Sun destroys it and you can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>protected against it by the cross is one</v>

688
00:39:34.331 --> 00:39:35.940
<v Speaker 1>of the things that works in horror </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

689
00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:37.013
<v Speaker 1>And I frequent the occurrences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This backfires after a priest and he </v>

690
00:39:40.961 --> 00:39:41.794
<v Speaker 1>holds up across in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's glowing when he's out of there and </v>

691
00:39:44.651 --> 00:39:48.940
<v Speaker 1>then the priest gets afraid and the glow</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes away and the vampire eats them.</v>

692
00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:53.890
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't exactly the same notion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Takes his bloody way.</v>

693
00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Well it's ident well anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the best answer.</v>

694
00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:01.780
<v Speaker 1>That question I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

695
00:40:01.781 --> 00:40:02.920
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing I want to say is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

696
00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:04.293
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you call the second level up their </v>

697
00:40:06.041 --> 00:40:08.020
<v Speaker 1>identity identification with the group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

698
00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.080
<v Speaker 1>It's adolescence because that's out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the license.</v>

699
00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Now you said that even when you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you try to be an individual,</v>

700
00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:17.890
<v Speaker 1>you still part of a group of people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that they're individuals.</v>

701
00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:19.083
<v Speaker 1>So I would say it would be possible to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think of that the top oval as </v>

702
00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:26.710
<v Speaker 1>identification with a group who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>

703
00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:31.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>main motivation is the process.</v>

704
00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:33.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's still possible.</v>

705
00:40:33.251 --> 00:40:35.440
<v Speaker 1>And the second thing I want to say is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

706
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.233
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a perfectly reasonable way of </v>

707
00:40:38.921 --> 00:40:41.530
<v Speaker 1>looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although it's a group composed of people</v>

708
00:40:41.531 --> 00:40:44.710
<v Speaker 1>whose job is to revive my screws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a group,</v>

709
00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:46.210
<v Speaker 1>it's not a group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a medic group.</v>

710
00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:48.600
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

711
00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:49.493
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an important point because one </v>

712
00:40:50.381 --> 00:40:51.214
<v Speaker 1>of the things that I brought up </v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday or last week was there's two </v>

713
00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:59.110
<v Speaker 1>types of primary philosophical question </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a Samsung scope relative.</v>

714
00:40:59.170 --> 00:41:01.120
<v Speaker 1>First question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the good,</v>

715
00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:04.960
<v Speaker 1>and that's a question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's a medic question,</v>

716
00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:08.080
<v Speaker 1>which is what is the nature of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process?</v>

717
00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.840
<v Speaker 1>The provides answers to the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the good?</v>

718
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Now a group answers the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is the good being an arts?</v>

719
00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:22.540
<v Speaker 1>What is the nature of the process that </v>
<v Speaker 1>allows you to answer the question?</v>

720
00:41:22.541 --> 00:41:23.680
<v Speaker 1>What is the good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

721
00:41:23.681 --> 00:41:24.514
<v Speaker 1>that's identification with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That group and [inaudible] group is the </v>

722
00:41:27.221 --> 00:41:30.280
<v Speaker 1>group of all individuals whose job is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>revitalize the group.</v>

723
00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:33.110
<v Speaker 1>So I think that is possible to fit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that,</v>

724
00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:34.310
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>

725
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:35.143
<v Speaker 2>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second thing I'm going to say is </v>

726
00:41:36.141 --> 00:41:41.030
<v Speaker 2>that I don't think that it's possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>for everyone to attain that level.</v>

727
00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:43.940
<v Speaker 2>Although I'd like to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

728
00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:47.630
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean not possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that some people,</v>

729
00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>temperament wise or not.</v>

730
00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:52.450
<v Speaker 2>So you say that the top level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

731
00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:54.093
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

732
00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:56.000
<v Speaker 2>the monsters you encounter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

733
00:41:56.001 --> 00:41:56.970
<v Speaker 2>You're so right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

734
00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:57.291
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

735
00:41:57.291 --> 00:41:58.124
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

736
00:41:59.300 --> 00:41:59.811
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

737
00:41:59.811 --> 00:42:00.471
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

738
00:42:00.471 --> 00:42:01.304
<v Speaker 2>but you've said that Shamans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said Shamans are people in that </v>

739
00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.240
<v Speaker 2>upper oval,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

740
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:06.051
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

741
00:42:06.051 --> 00:42:06.884
<v Speaker 2>So now the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Mayans and Aztecs do believe that </v>

742
00:42:10.341 --> 00:42:12.560
<v Speaker 2>not everyone can be a showman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

743
00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:15.210
<v Speaker 2>That only certain people with certain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

744
00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:16.630
<v Speaker 2>unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

745
00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:17.903
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just of unconscious strength could </v>

746
00:42:18.861 --> 00:42:20.450
<v Speaker 2>be one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that it's,</v>

747
00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:22.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people just have a,</v>

748
00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:24.860
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

749
00:42:24.861 --> 00:42:28.160
<v Speaker 1>I want to go talking and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

750
00:42:28.161 --> 00:42:30.830
<v Speaker 1>that's a perfectly reasonable objection </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a sense,</v>

751
00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:33.520
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the case that heroism in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sense,</v>

752
00:42:33.521 --> 00:42:35.270
<v Speaker 1>so curves and different levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

753
00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

754
00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:38.120
<v Speaker 1>I want to show you another dining room.</v>

755
00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:47.300
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we asked,</v>

756
00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:52.563
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

757
00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:54.101
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well here,</v>

758
00:42:54.101 --> 00:42:58.140
<v Speaker 1>let's do a simpler one first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was this side here,</v>

759
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.983
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how your plans are actually </v>

760
00:43:00.551 --> 00:43:03.220
<v Speaker 1>organized and under some circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

761
00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:07.480
<v Speaker 1>planning your plan B and they're both </v>
<v Speaker 1>more or less what this is as good as the</v>

762
00:43:07.481 --> 00:43:09.190
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't really work.</v>

763
00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:10.083
<v Speaker 1>But it's a reasonable way of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because almost always you do plan a </v>

764
00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:16.090
<v Speaker 1>because it's better than plan b.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least they think of it.</v>

765
00:43:16.091 --> 00:43:16.924
<v Speaker 1>So we didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it occupies a position that's higher up </v>

766
00:43:18.581 --> 00:43:21.570
<v Speaker 1>in the hierarchy and you'll shift down </v>
<v Speaker 1>to plan B if you have to.</v>

767
00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:23.283
<v Speaker 1>So that's where I've said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you have two alternative plans and </v>

768
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:29.650
<v Speaker 1>this would be the representation where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

769
00:43:29.651 --> 00:43:30.484
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

770
00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:31.383
<v Speaker 1>it's only one plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This and ask is ultimately you can only </v>

771
00:43:33.701 --> 00:43:36.280
<v Speaker 1>do one thing at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>

772
00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:37.810
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

773
00:43:37.811 --> 00:43:40.270
<v Speaker 1>That's why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually why we have interests.</v>

774
00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Like in conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we have one output apparatus and</v>

775
00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:49.480
<v Speaker 1>a dozen input around says and only one </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets control at a time.</v>

776
00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:55.320
<v Speaker 1>So that's the nature of quotes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is when a motivational system,</v>

777
00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:59.470
<v Speaker 1>they say run like hell and motivation be</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to be,</v>

778
00:43:59.471 --> 00:44:00.131
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

779
00:44:00.131 --> 00:44:03.400
<v Speaker 1>let's get something to eat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational system C is saying,</v>

780
00:44:03.401 --> 00:44:05.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should actually go visit our friends,</v>

781
00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.960
<v Speaker 1>so that's conflict and there's all to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get all this record.</v>

782
00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:09.220
<v Speaker 1>It's one on foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

783
00:44:09.221 --> 00:44:12.610
<v Speaker 1>That's an effective just regulation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>went up with a service.</v>

784
00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:15.490
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

785
00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:17.980
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're hoping for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One output that serious,</v>

786
00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:20.860
<v Speaker 1>all goals fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of those are valid.</v>

787
00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:22.443
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What behavioral pattern best satisfies </v>

788
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:28.263
<v Speaker 1>all conceivable motivational goals in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>social context composed of individuals </v>

789
00:44:32.821 --> 00:44:33.654
<v Speaker 1>who are doing exactly the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that'll have to be completed over </v>

790
00:44:35.731 --> 00:44:36.420
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

791
00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:39.150
<v Speaker 1>There's more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more to it that works over time.</v>

792
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:43.680
<v Speaker 1>It's stable enough to maintain itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and flexible enough to readjust.</v>

793
00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:48.070
<v Speaker 1>That's the criteria for the southern </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that's missed it in.</v>

794
00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:49.253
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>temp temporality makes a big difference </v>

795
00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:53.670
<v Speaker 1>because what works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why authority.</v>

796
00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:54.643
<v Speaker 1>Another traction for authoritarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>societies is they work but not for very </v>

797
00:44:58.891 --> 00:45:00.810
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not very good at,</v>

798
00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:03.120
<v Speaker 1>don't have very good at power </v>
<v Speaker 1>transitions.</v>

799
00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:04.013
<v Speaker 1>When the king dies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the people that he squashed or </v>

800
00:45:06.331 --> 00:45:08.960
<v Speaker 1>just squashed paypal does not make very </v>
<v Speaker 1>good kings,</v>

801
00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:12.330
<v Speaker 1>sort of makes the authoritarian state </v>
<v Speaker 1>the client.</v>

802
00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:14.580
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

803
00:45:14.581 --> 00:45:15.414
<v Speaker 1>now</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's look at how you actually maybe </v>

804
00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:22.650
<v Speaker 1>choose between different alternatives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this is,</v>

805
00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:26.280
<v Speaker 1>this kind of touches on some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things we discussed yesterday.</v>

806
00:45:26.770 --> 00:45:28.290
<v Speaker 1>If you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a,</v>

807
00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:33.380
<v Speaker 1>this is an interesting question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fail a test and uh,</v>

808
00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:38.573
<v Speaker 1>well that blows your course goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say your core school was getting </v>

809
00:45:41.721 --> 00:45:43.530
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you're going to get a seat and maybe</v>

810
00:45:43.531 --> 00:45:44.364
<v Speaker 1>it has some trends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even effects on your educational </v>

811
00:45:46.531 --> 00:45:51.531
<v Speaker 1>attainment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some even more trans effects on career.</v>

812
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Valence of the normals,</v>

813
00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:56.183
<v Speaker 1>inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the b minus shifts with your </v>

814
00:45:59.101 --> 00:46:01.230
<v Speaker 1>framework of reference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

815
00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:03.500
<v Speaker 1>With regards to this course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a catastrophe.</v>

816
00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:07.470
<v Speaker 1>With regards to my education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an inconvenience with regards to my</v>

817
00:46:07.471 --> 00:46:08.304
<v Speaker 1>career.</v>

818
00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:10.283
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

819
00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:14.430
<v Speaker 1>It's tricky with regards to my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a nonentity,</v>

820
00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:17.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can switch the valence of,</v>

821
00:46:17.361 --> 00:46:18.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an anomalous,</v>

822
00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:19.483
<v Speaker 1>the valence on the anomalous piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information shift with frame of </v>

823
00:46:22.411 --> 00:46:24.900
<v Speaker 1>reference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a useful thing to know.</v>

824
00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:27.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the idea.</v>

825
00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:28.233
<v Speaker 1>If you're trying to get from here to </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and you have a plan but it doesn't </v>

826
00:46:32.431 --> 00:46:34.320
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

827
00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:37.860
<v Speaker 1>So within that larger frame of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reference,</v>

828
00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:42.030
<v Speaker 1>you undergo a small descends into chaos </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can come up with another plan.</v>

829
00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:43.253
<v Speaker 1>But the chaos here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this deals with some of the issues you </v>

830
00:46:47.251 --> 00:46:49.830
<v Speaker 1>talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you me at one time too about the idea</v>

831
00:46:49.831 --> 00:46:52.890
<v Speaker 1>that the chaos that was outside was also</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside.</v>

832
00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:55.200
<v Speaker 1>Well that's how it works as far as I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell,</v>

833
00:46:55.530 --> 00:47:00.530
<v Speaker 1>is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the effect of valence of this particular</v>

834
00:47:00.661 --> 00:47:03.930
<v Speaker 1>anomalous piece of information is </v>
<v Speaker 1>bounded by a larger story.</v>

835
00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:05.723
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the thing is is it's a drag that you </v>

836
00:47:07.651 --> 00:47:10.350
<v Speaker 1>get a b minus from the perspective of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the course.</v>

837
00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:15.030
<v Speaker 1>But if you pop by the valence of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>anomaly is bounded by the fact that it's</v>

838
00:47:15.031 --> 00:47:15.864
<v Speaker 1>really not going to hurt your education </v>
<v Speaker 1>goals that much and then it's not going </v>

839
00:47:19.581 --> 00:47:21.710
<v Speaker 1>to affect your career at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have,</v>

840
00:47:21.810 --> 00:47:22.643
<v Speaker 1>there's a domain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a domain in which the anomalous </v>

841
00:47:26.251 --> 00:47:27.084
<v Speaker 1>inflammation is actually valid and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole bunch of domains where </v>

842
00:47:29.501 --> 00:47:30.334
<v Speaker 1>it isn't.</v>

843
00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:33.160
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the problem is sometimes you encountered</v>

844
00:47:33.161 --> 00:47:33.994
<v Speaker 5>anomalous piece of information</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's Valence is unbounded and blows </v>

845
00:47:40.601 --> 00:47:41.434
<v Speaker 5>apart whole structures of stories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let's say this is a bit of a </v>

846
00:47:45.971 --> 00:47:48.730
<v Speaker 5>different circumstance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're hovering on the edge of it except</v>

847
00:47:48.731 --> 00:47:49.930
<v Speaker 5>for filigree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For medical school,</v>

848
00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:52.720
<v Speaker 5>it's like one more b minus your over </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

849
00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:57.790
<v Speaker 5>So</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have a professor that everybody gets</v>

850
00:47:57.791 --> 00:48:00.710
<v Speaker 5>along with except you can you get a d </v>
<v Speaker 5>minus for,</v>

851
00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:03.663
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the end of medical school plus </v>

852
00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:07.090
<v Speaker 5>there's this other residual mystery </v>
<v Speaker 5>leashes.</v>

853
00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:09.910
<v Speaker 5>Why does everybody except you get along </v>
<v Speaker 5>with this person.</v>

854
00:48:10.210 --> 00:48:12.670
<v Speaker 5>Maybe this is also something you've </v>
<v Speaker 5>noticed it on the classes.</v>

855
00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:15.730
<v Speaker 5>It's like this particular piece of </v>
<v Speaker 5>anomalous information.</v>

856
00:48:16.530 --> 00:48:18.700
<v Speaker 5>The domain is very unbounded,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

857
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:21.210
<v Speaker 5>It blows the chorus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It blows the educational table.</v>

858
00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:24.060
<v Speaker 5>We'll say all you are going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>university for us to be a doctor.</v>

859
00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:24.970
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

860
00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:27.430
<v Speaker 5>It's like the rest of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a means to an end and that's it.</v>

861
00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:30.280
<v Speaker 5>You're not interested in biology.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have no alternate.</v>

862
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:31.833
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't have any other legs to stand </v>

863
00:48:32.981 --> 00:48:33.731
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

864
00:48:33.731 --> 00:48:35.560
<v Speaker 5>You've sacrificed your own interest </v>
<v Speaker 5>even,</v>

865
00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:37.293
<v Speaker 5>which is a dangerous thing to do in </v>
<v Speaker 5>pursuit of this bound donated stability </v>

866
00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:41.973
<v Speaker 5>that's gone well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then you have a piece of anomalous </v>

867
00:48:44.261 --> 00:48:45.094
<v Speaker 5>information that's here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just below his whole sequences of </v>

868
00:48:48.371 --> 00:48:52.330
<v Speaker 5>stories and you're depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the larger the area</v>

869
00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:55.950
<v Speaker 5>inside each of these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>

870
00:48:56.110 --> 00:48:56.943
<v Speaker 5>these are the turtles all the way down </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the Roseville firmness and the </v>

871
00:48:58.981 --> 00:49:02.230
<v Speaker 5>turtles go all the way down</v>
<v Speaker 5>anyways.</v>

872
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:05.703
<v Speaker 5>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the broader the domain that the </v>

873
00:49:07.271 --> 00:49:10.840
<v Speaker 5>anomalous information destroys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more of your life falls into pieces.</v>

874
00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:14.220
<v Speaker 5>So that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

875
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:15.820
<v Speaker 5>you can think of in terms of group </v>
<v Speaker 5>behavior,</v>

876
00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:19.690
<v Speaker 5>to the degree that you and I share a </v>
<v Speaker 5>goal,</v>

877
00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:22.930
<v Speaker 5>a threat to that story will unite us as </v>
<v Speaker 5>a group.</v>

878
00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:26.160
<v Speaker 5>So let's say the Republicans hate </v>
<v Speaker 5>universities.</v>

879
00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:28.060
<v Speaker 5>We both like universities.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

880
00:49:28.061 --> 00:49:28.894
<v Speaker 5>therefore us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the purposes of that particular </v>

881
00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:32.760
<v Speaker 5>event,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we constitute group.</v>

882
00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:35.560
<v Speaker 5>But if the Republicans hate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

883
00:49:35.561 --> 00:49:37.210
<v Speaker 5>let's say we go in the university </v>
<v Speaker 5>administration,</v>

884
00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:38.373
<v Speaker 5>the Dean hates science,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but really likes the humanities and </v>

885
00:49:40.781 --> 00:49:42.610
<v Speaker 5>you're in the humanities and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>sciences.</v>

886
00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:44.033
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're two different groups all of a </v>

887
00:49:45.101 --> 00:49:46.570
<v Speaker 5>sudden.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

888
00:49:46.571 --> 00:49:49.270
<v Speaker 5>The anomalous information has a </v>
<v Speaker 5>different valence for us.</v>

889
00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:51.393
<v Speaker 5>Our goals determined,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which are because we've identified with </v>

890
00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:57.160
<v Speaker 5>a group or goals are going to determine </v>
<v Speaker 5>the information.</v>

891
00:49:57.550 --> 00:49:59.480
<v Speaker 5>Also from cards,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the kids in group.</v>

892
00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:01.963
<v Speaker 4>This is easier to understand</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's all kinds of information </v>

893
00:50:09.761 --> 00:50:14.410
<v Speaker 4>that complained you into despair that </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't seem to be directly related to any</v>

894
00:50:14.411 --> 00:50:15.244
<v Speaker 4>plan of action.</v>

895
00:50:17.550 --> 00:50:19.080
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Next Diagram.</v>

896
00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:21.280
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is how this is really good.</v>

897
00:50:21.281 --> 00:50:22.440
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because there isn't any accident.</v>

898
00:50:22.441 --> 00:50:23.640
<v Speaker 5>It's not a golden record.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

899
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:25.260
<v Speaker 5>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the brief answer to that.</v>

900
00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 5>Look what this story does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What</v>

901
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:28.873
<v Speaker 1>a story does literally is provide all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the events that you encounter with </v>

902
00:50:32.721 --> 00:50:35.570
<v Speaker 1>determinants significance and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>all construed.</v>

903
00:50:35.571 --> 00:50:36.404
<v Speaker 1>The significance of any event is </v>
<v Speaker 1>construed with regards to its to its </v>

904
00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.230
<v Speaker 1>perceived relationship to a goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

905
00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:43.363
<v Speaker 1>Say that it's the loss of your mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't seem to affect any story </v>

906
00:50:46.341 --> 00:50:49.040
<v Speaker 1>that you can say you put your finger on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

907
00:50:49.041 --> 00:50:50.900
<v Speaker 1>Well then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

908
00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:52.810
<v Speaker 1>this is tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a really tough issue.</v>

909
00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:53.673
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you brought it up because a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the stories that we participate in </v>

910
00:50:57.530 --> 00:51:00.170
<v Speaker 1>aren't explicit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't state what they are.</v>

911
00:51:00.550 --> 00:51:03.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

912
00:51:03.111 --> 00:51:04.830
<v Speaker 1>I may indication you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think about it.</v>

913
00:51:04.831 --> 00:51:05.664
<v Speaker 1>If you think this is accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take something like the American </v>

914
00:51:07.701 --> 00:51:09.230
<v Speaker 1>constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

915
00:51:09.231 --> 00:51:13.870
<v Speaker 1>That's an explicit body of rules that </v>
<v Speaker 1>defines a state so that's a bounded,</v>

916
00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:18.880
<v Speaker 1>don't make mistake but it's predicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first of that chapter he pointed out</v>

917
00:51:19.901 --> 00:51:20.734
<v Speaker 1>in a Thomas Kuhn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no current go down and sending them any </v>

918
00:51:24.951 --> 00:51:26.420
<v Speaker 1>assistance internally.</v>

919
00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:27.253
<v Speaker 1>Coherent and complete isn't necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>is predicated on preset positions that </v>

920
00:51:29.651 --> 00:51:31.550
<v Speaker 1>can be proved for wind from within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

921
00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:33.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's talking about this.</v>

922
00:51:33.591 --> 00:51:36.380
<v Speaker 1>I think this infinite regressive systems</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

923
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:37.223
<v Speaker 1>well you can look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you play the geometries example except </v>

924
00:51:40.071 --> 00:51:44.750
<v Speaker 1>the first five axioms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you're in the story in a way you go</v>

925
00:51:44.751 --> 00:51:47.030
<v Speaker 1>but you have to accept those axioms on </v>
<v Speaker 1>faith and I would say,</v>

926
00:51:47.031 --> 00:51:47.864
<v Speaker 1>well those axioms are actually nasty in </v>
<v Speaker 1>another story and that story in term is </v>

927
00:51:51.411 --> 00:51:54.410
<v Speaker 1>nested in another story in and so on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so forth.</v>

928
00:51:54.411 --> 00:51:57.710
<v Speaker 1>As far as you want to look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The American constitution for example,</v>

929
00:51:58.250 --> 00:52:00.920
<v Speaker 1>is predicated on these on natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights.</v>

930
00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:02.760
<v Speaker 1>That's how I read it anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

931
00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:06.290
<v Speaker 1>which is an national rights are a brief </v>
<v Speaker 1>description,</v>

932
00:52:06.291 --> 00:52:07.124
<v Speaker 1>some exquisite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some implicit of what it means to be </v>

933
00:52:09.231 --> 00:52:12.080
<v Speaker 1>human or what being human means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means lots of things.</v>

934
00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:13.293
<v Speaker 1>It means that you're equal before God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be the most fundamental </v>

935
00:52:15.681 --> 00:52:16.514
<v Speaker 1>presupposition and that's a weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>question that deals with your request </v>

936
00:52:22.041 --> 00:52:22.874
<v Speaker 1>and to some degree about the capability </v>
<v Speaker 1>of everybody to get to that highest </v>

937
00:52:25.521 --> 00:52:26.354
<v Speaker 1>level of achievement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the constitution is predicated on </v>

938
00:52:28.521 --> 00:52:31.130
<v Speaker 1>the notion that everyone has that </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity,</v>

939
00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:35.510
<v Speaker 1>everyone universally equally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everyone has the capacity to follow.</v>

940
00:52:35.511 --> 00:52:36.344
<v Speaker 1>They go back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not necessarily to go to a certain </v>

941
00:52:37.821 --> 00:52:38.654
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

942
00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:42.980
<v Speaker 1>The level of the activity is individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>specific.</v>

943
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:44.610
<v Speaker 1>That's why you have individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>interests.</v>

944
00:52:44.611 --> 00:52:46.250
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes you individuals,</v>

945
00:52:46.251 --> 00:52:49.790
<v Speaker 1>those things that appeal to you and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>domain of competence is unique,</v>

946
00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:54.680
<v Speaker 1>but still the capacity to engage in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>process at some level,</v>

947
00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:55.693
<v Speaker 1>we don't care what the problem is as </v>
<v Speaker 1>long as you're an to find with the </v>

948
00:52:57.351 --> 00:52:59.150
<v Speaker 1>process you're identifying with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

949
00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:02.030
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the idea of the constitution.</v>

950
00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:03.283
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's predicated on these </v>

951
00:53:03.921 --> 00:53:05.930
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions that I think have </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious,</v>

952
00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:07.813
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're derived from religious </v>

953
00:53:08.601 --> 00:53:09.434
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the idea of equality of all </v>

954
00:53:11.361 --> 00:53:12.820
<v Speaker 1>individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before we go on like that,</v>

955
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:17.080
<v Speaker 1>that idea is when its explicit form </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's 2000 years old.</v>

956
00:53:17.570 --> 00:53:18.403
<v Speaker 1>Before that it sort of hung around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Egyptians thought that the higher </v>

957
00:53:21.381 --> 00:53:22.214
<v Speaker 1>level of aristocrats who are perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to the pharaoh in terms of </v>

958
00:53:25.291 --> 00:53:26.124
<v Speaker 1>their potential for a motel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't made explicit till about </v>

959
00:53:30.061 --> 00:53:33.030
<v Speaker 1>2000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was implicit.</v>

960
00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:37.470
<v Speaker 1>So it was the kind of story before it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was explicit.</v>

961
00:53:37.471 --> 00:53:40.680
<v Speaker 1>It was in some other form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>

962
00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:42.773
<v Speaker 1>we're not conscious of all her stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is for me to say what I mean by </v>

963
00:53:46.861 --> 00:53:49.560
<v Speaker 1>that is that although we have stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the weekend,</v>

964
00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:53.700
<v Speaker 1>we don't know they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can explain what they mean.</v>

965
00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Some of our stories and the best we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>do is transmit them in images.</v>

966
00:53:57.630 --> 00:54:00.600
<v Speaker 1>Some of them that we know even less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the best we can do is act out.</v>

967
00:54:01.690 --> 00:54:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that,</v>

968
00:54:02.881 --> 00:54:06.420
<v Speaker 1>does that make any sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we had religious stories.</v>

969
00:54:06.421 --> 00:54:07.254
<v Speaker 1>They'd guarded their behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They constituted the basis for our </v>

970
00:54:09.931 --> 00:54:12.120
<v Speaker 1>unions into groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had these stories,</v>

971
00:54:12.121 --> 00:54:12.954
<v Speaker 1>but we didn't know what they meant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the story was it encoded in the form </v>

972
00:54:16.411 --> 00:54:17.244
<v Speaker 1>of image and action and not coated in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the form of any sort of explicit </v>

973
00:54:21.031 --> 00:54:22.770
<v Speaker 1>content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't say what it meant.</v>

974
00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:25.310
<v Speaker 1>So you're also saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

975
00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:26.520
<v Speaker 1>we've got a nice story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell him,</v>

976
00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:28.380
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gas,</v>

977
00:54:28.381 --> 00:54:30.900
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least that our stories,</v>

978
00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:33.180
<v Speaker 1>it's a causal loop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

979
00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Where does he tell the story?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Modifies the behavior,</v>

980
00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:40.860
<v Speaker 1>but I would say to the degree that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can draw a temporal influences,</v>

981
00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:42.323
<v Speaker 1>the behavior precedes the description of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the behavior at least as often as the </v>

982
00:54:46.501 --> 00:54:48.570
<v Speaker 1>description proceeds in the behavior it </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs.</v>

983
00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:49.403
<v Speaker 1>You pointed out then like most most </v>
<v Speaker 1>western or just sort of have this </v>

984
00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:57.750
<v Speaker 1>assumption that we construct it more </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules than we follow.</v>

985
00:54:58.290 --> 00:54:59.130
<v Speaker 1>Nature said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald,</v>

986
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.180
<v Speaker 1>we have more rules than we're embedded </v>
<v Speaker 1>in our behaviors.</v>

987
00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:06.270
<v Speaker 1>We observe the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we told stories about them.</v>

988
00:55:06.271 --> 00:55:10.470
<v Speaker 1>Then we dissected the stories and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>came up with general principles.</v>

989
00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Then once have you formulated the </v>
<v Speaker 1>general principles,</v>

990
00:55:13.170 --> 00:55:16.260
<v Speaker 1>we turned around and said that the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the general principles existed were</v>

991
00:55:16.261 --> 00:55:19.770
<v Speaker 1>the reasons for the behavior wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although north completely,</v>

992
00:55:19.771 --> 00:55:23.940
<v Speaker 1>because once you can tell the story and </v>
<v Speaker 1>once you can make the most explicit,</v>

993
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:26.520
<v Speaker 1>that can change your behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's not so easy.</v>

994
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:29.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You were saying that this case,</v>

995
00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:33.400
<v Speaker 5>do you think that that would be stage?</v>

996
00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:37.300
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because usually what,</v>

997
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:40.550
<v Speaker 1>what what religious means is it means </v>
<v Speaker 1>dogma,</v>

998
00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:41.740
<v Speaker 1>norm spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

999
00:55:42.070 --> 00:55:42.903
<v Speaker 1>The reason that the church and the state</v>
<v Speaker 1>were separated but I think was quite </v>

1000
00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:47.543
<v Speaker 1>simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to make a distinction when you </v>

1001
00:55:50.591 --> 00:55:55.591
<v Speaker 1>talk about religious structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the explicit beliefs and the spirit that</v>

1002
00:55:56.830 --> 00:55:57.663
<v Speaker 1>moves the entire religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same distinction that </v>

1003
00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:01.460
<v Speaker 1>Dostoyevsky was turning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making the crab,</v>

1004
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:05.170
<v Speaker 1>the dogmatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pardon?</v>

1005
00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:09.010
<v Speaker 1>The Catholic Church is tyrannical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely tyrannical.</v>

1006
00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:10.890
<v Speaker 1>All it is concerned with is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>position,</v>

1007
00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:12.573
<v Speaker 1>but then there's this other part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This signified a Dostoevsky story by </v>

1008
00:56:14.681 --> 00:56:15.514
<v Speaker 1>Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When those two cards come into contact </v>

1009
00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:20.170
<v Speaker 1>with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dogmatic aspect attempts to kill the</v>

1010
00:56:20.171 --> 00:56:23.750
<v Speaker 1>creative aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Dostoevsky story entirely,</v>

1011
00:56:23.830 --> 00:56:26.200
<v Speaker 1>let smoke the back door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is again,</v>

1012
00:56:26.201 --> 00:56:27.034
<v Speaker 1>that's why that's a brilliant story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the problem with the state and </v>

1013
00:56:30.730 --> 00:56:35.620
<v Speaker 1>religious because then the religion </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes dogma and that's,</v>

1014
00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:38.200
<v Speaker 1>and I think part of the reason that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>church in the state are separated,</v>

1015
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:39.063
<v Speaker 1>your part is to stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is another barrier stopping that from </v>

1016
00:56:42.311 --> 00:56:42.940
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

1017
00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:45.340
<v Speaker 1>But I would also say that the American </v>
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>

1018
00:56:45.550 --> 00:56:48.720
<v Speaker 1>it is religious as Protestant and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>structured conflict.</v>

1019
00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:49.563
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I said about organized </v>

1020
00:56:50.141 --> 00:56:52.950
<v Speaker 1>religion being designed to prevent you </v>
<v Speaker 1>from having a religious experience.</v>

1021
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.030
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1022
00:56:54.130 --> 00:56:54.551
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1023
00:56:54.551 --> 00:56:55.384
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where the dog with us and a good </v>

1024
00:56:57.011 --> 00:56:59.350
<v Speaker 1>thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good thing because</v>

1025
00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:06.010
<v Speaker 1>prior to the adolescent stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want that sort of experience.</v>

1026
00:57:06.011 --> 00:57:06.844
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't want to expose your child</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the unknown if you want to expose </v>

1027
00:57:11.411 --> 00:57:14.080
<v Speaker 1>them in very measured doses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under controlled conditions,</v>

1028
00:57:14.081 --> 00:57:16.180
<v Speaker 1>in a secure environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then only when,</v>

1029
00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:18.910
<v Speaker 1>only when you can't do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

1030
00:57:18.911 --> 00:57:19.810
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on your own.</v>

1031
00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:22.420
<v Speaker 1>And the reason you say that is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>

1032
00:57:22.421 --> 00:57:24.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mother can get dates for you.</v>

1033
00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:26.570
<v Speaker 1>That's just a condition of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eastern intention.</v>

1034
00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:29.540
<v Speaker 1>That's just reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1035
00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:33.033
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1036
00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:34.893
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about implicit stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's look at how these stories get </v>

1037
00:57:38.621 --> 00:57:41.560
<v Speaker 1>constructed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an idea.</v>

1038
00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:44.093
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

1039
00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:52.390
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's your nasty story structure,</v>

1040
00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:54.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the way down.</v>

1041
00:57:54.131 --> 00:57:55.780
<v Speaker 1>There are stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1042
00:57:55.781 --> 00:57:58.270
<v Speaker 1>how did the stories come about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1043
00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:01.900
<v Speaker 1>they come about empiricism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why put that in?</v>

1044
00:58:01.901 --> 00:58:02.734
<v Speaker 1>For reasons we can argue about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are all different ways that we </v>

1045
00:58:05.861 --> 00:58:06.694
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to behave and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>we figure out how to behave here and we </v>

1046
00:58:12.311 --> 00:58:13.144
<v Speaker 1>moved back here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes we figured out how to </v>

1047
00:58:15.371 --> 00:58:16.204
<v Speaker 1>behave here and we move up here and each</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these levels in forms and alters all </v>

1048
00:58:20.921 --> 00:58:25.900
<v Speaker 1>the other levels</v>
<v Speaker 1>for those stories that are most profound</v>

1049
00:58:26.890 --> 00:58:28.930
<v Speaker 1>stories that we really understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>poorly.</v>

1050
00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:32.050
<v Speaker 1>What's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1051
00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:36.490
<v Speaker 1>if you put four people on an island and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't talk,</v>

1052
00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:39.880
<v Speaker 1>they're deaf and dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to organize their behavior</v>

1053
00:58:39.881 --> 00:58:43.720
<v Speaker 1>into a particular structure and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure takes into account fee.</v>

1054
00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:47.230
<v Speaker 1>Right now we're assuming that it's a a </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy society.</v>

1055
00:58:48.310 --> 00:58:48.821
<v Speaker 1>People say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1056
00:58:48.821 --> 00:58:49.900
<v Speaker 1>that's relativistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1057
00:58:49.901 --> 00:58:51.850
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of different sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy societies.</v>

1058
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:55.480
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a crock by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>

1059
00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:56.513
<v Speaker 1>they're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a set number of problems to </v>

1060
00:58:58.091 --> 00:59:03.091
<v Speaker 1>solve and the problems are how does each</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual fulfill those tasks they have</v>

1061
00:59:03.641 --> 00:59:04.474
<v Speaker 1>to fulfill in order to live in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presence of the other people who are </v>

1062
00:59:07.631 --> 00:59:08.464
<v Speaker 1>doing the same thing in a domain that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>bounded by whatever resources happened </v>

1063
00:59:11.951 --> 00:59:12.784
<v Speaker 1>to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there these people who can't talk </v>

1064
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:17.223
<v Speaker 1>can't use language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to modify each other's </v>

1065
00:59:18.641 --> 00:59:21.440
<v Speaker 1>behavior by an exchange of information,</v>

1066
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:24.740
<v Speaker 5>reinforcements,</v>
<v Speaker 5>positive reinforcement,</v>

1067
00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:26.143
<v Speaker 5>negative reinforcement,</v>
<v Speaker 5>punishments like we always modify each </v>

1068
00:59:28.371 --> 00:59:29.204
<v Speaker 5>other's behavior in every social </v>
<v Speaker 5>interaction by gesture and look and </v>

1069
00:59:31.881 --> 00:59:32.714
<v Speaker 5>attention and inattention,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going to construct a way of </v>

1070
00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:40.430
<v Speaker 5>being that has this structure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>None of them are going to be able to say</v>

1071
00:59:40.431 --> 00:59:41.264
<v Speaker 5>what it is say now take that analogy is </v>
<v Speaker 5>just an idea in imagination and extend </v>

1072
00:59:46.021 --> 00:59:46.854
<v Speaker 5>that to groups that can boast thousands </v>
<v Speaker 5>of people who'd been interacting over </v>

1073
00:59:52.610 --> 00:59:53.443
<v Speaker 5>hundreds of thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all that social behavior from all </v>

1074
00:59:56.841 --> 00:59:57.674
<v Speaker 5>that social behavior emerges as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>pattern in so far as the culture is </v>

1075
01:00:00.321 --> 01:00:01.154
<v Speaker 5>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we imitate behaviors that we see as </v>

1076
01:00:07.131 --> 01:00:07.964
<v Speaker 5>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We play with the invitations and </v>

1077
01:00:09.681 --> 01:00:10.514
<v Speaker 5>ritualize the play and dramatize the </v>
<v Speaker 5>rituals and then we collect our </v>

1078
01:00:14.541 --> 01:00:16.700
<v Speaker 5>information about how to behave it </v>
<v Speaker 5>damages.</v>

1079
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:18.560
<v Speaker 5>We formalize it into myths.</v>

1080
01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:22.093
<v Speaker 5>Once you have a religion established,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is a codify description of </v>

1081
01:00:24.411 --> 01:00:27.560
<v Speaker 5>acceptable behavioral patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can start drawing general rules from</v>

1082
01:00:27.561 --> 01:00:28.394
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then you can start criticizing so forth </v>

1083
01:00:30.291 --> 01:00:31.124
<v Speaker 5>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Each emergent level of abstraction </v>

1084
01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:37.250
<v Speaker 5>alters the function of all the previous </v>
<v Speaker 5>levels</v>

1085
01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:43.370
<v Speaker 5>and that's how we construct our stories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now the danger of course is that</v>

1086
01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:49.370
<v Speaker 5>having abstract and up the story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they part of the story,</v>

1087
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:54.570
<v Speaker 5>you can criticize it and destroy it </v>
<v Speaker 5>without even understanding what it was.</v>

1088
01:00:54.571 --> 01:00:55.404
<v Speaker 5>The dealer then you were destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We knocks and I think that's what we've </v>

1089
01:00:58.161 --> 01:01:00.320
<v Speaker 5>done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once we go up to this level,</v>

1090
01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:05.450
<v Speaker 5>all of these levels we were storing to </v>
<v Speaker 5>behavior and analyze it.</v>

1091
01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.970
<v Speaker 5>We developed a scientific methodology </v>
<v Speaker 5>and said,</v>

1092
01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:11.050
<v Speaker 5>that's not what the universe is like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bang everyone.</v>

1093
01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:11.913
<v Speaker 5>All the stories.</v>

1094
01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:22.460
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just the stories philosophy.</v>

1095
01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:26.640
<v Speaker 5>Well because,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1096
01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:32.090
<v Speaker 5>well the bridge from philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 5>rationalities isn't too too,</v>

1097
01:01:32.570 --> 01:01:34.250
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't seem to be qualitatively </v>
<v Speaker 5>different.</v>

1098
01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:38.400
<v Speaker 5>I mean science was originally called,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

1099
01:01:38.930 --> 01:01:42.950
<v Speaker 5>but look what are all I would say here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that up to this point,</v>

1100
01:01:47.590 --> 01:01:49.250
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1101
01:01:49.251 --> 01:01:51.430
<v Speaker 5>That's why I said I didn't know if I </v>
<v Speaker 5>should put this in.</v>

1102
01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:54.740
<v Speaker 5>It is confused.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

1103
01:01:54.741 --> 01:01:57.030
<v Speaker 5>Then that's probably the problem with </v>
<v Speaker 5>this particular diagram.</v>

1104
01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:02.380
<v Speaker 5>Something happened here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happened here was that from here to</v>

1105
01:02:03.201 --> 01:02:06.440
<v Speaker 5>here when we said knowledge of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world,</v>

1106
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:10.060
<v Speaker 5>what we meant was knowledge of world </v>
<v Speaker 5>pots,</v>

1107
01:02:10.070 --> 01:02:10.903
<v Speaker 5>knowledge of how to behave.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When we got to hear what we said was </v>

1108
01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:15.073
<v Speaker 5>that the world was a place where fact </v>
<v Speaker 5>that the world was a place of facts and </v>

1109
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:23.070
<v Speaker 5>we saw that the world of facts wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>constructed.</v>

1110
01:02:23.071 --> 01:02:27.090
<v Speaker 5>The way the world that you act in was </v>
<v Speaker 5>constructed in our images,</v>

1111
01:02:27.091 --> 01:02:30.530
<v Speaker 5>which is to say there isn't a garden </v>
<v Speaker 5>handling devil man.</v>

1112
01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:31.373
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that the center of the university?</v>
<v Speaker 5>From a factual perspective and all </v>

1113
01:02:34.030 --> 01:02:37.770
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and from the empirical perspective,</v>

1114
01:02:37.771 --> 01:02:38.604
<v Speaker 5>it seems very unlikely that the world </v>
<v Speaker 5>was created in seven days and so on and </v>

1115
01:02:41.131 --> 01:02:41.964
<v Speaker 5>so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it looks like there was evolution </v>

1116
01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:47.700
<v Speaker 5>and that really played havoc with this </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole sequence of stories.</v>

1117
01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.073
<v Speaker 5>The problem was these stories were about</v>
<v Speaker 5>the world as a place to APP and not </v>

1118
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:53.820
<v Speaker 5>about the world as a collection of </v>
<v Speaker 5>facts.</v>

1119
01:02:54.030 --> 01:02:56.690
<v Speaker 5>So made a category error here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

1120
01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:57.833
<v Speaker 5>and undermined our belief in our </v>
<v Speaker 5>accumulated how old shoe without ever </v>

1121
01:03:01.610 --> 01:03:04.200
<v Speaker 5>understanding explicitly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

1122
01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:06.933
<v Speaker 5>that maybe shouldn't be there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it does come at the end of the </v>

1123
01:03:09.211 --> 01:03:12.120
<v Speaker 5>process of abstraction,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think from an historic perspective.</v>

1124
01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:18.350
<v Speaker 5>So does that help</v>
<v Speaker 5>you still have a residual concern</v>

1125
01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:22.963
<v Speaker 5>now?</v>

1126
01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:24.623
<v Speaker 2>I think the enthusiasm that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's empiricism criticism that that </v>

1127
01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:28.043
<v Speaker 2>everyone else thinks is empiricism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Empiricism that that you would like us </v>

1128
01:03:31.201 --> 01:03:32.034
<v Speaker 2>to attain.</v>

1129
01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:32.973
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sorry.</v>

1130
01:03:33.250 --> 01:03:34.083
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you shouldn't get that complicated with </v>

1131
01:03:35.131 --> 01:03:36.660
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I just put down,</v>

1132
01:03:36.690 --> 01:03:37.523
<v Speaker 5>I just put that here because it looked </v>
<v Speaker 5>to me like it was at the end of the </v>

1133
01:03:39.571 --> 01:03:42.720
<v Speaker 5>historical chain of development.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's qualitatively different in some</v>

1134
01:03:42.721 --> 01:03:44.200
<v Speaker 5>ways than these things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1135
01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:46.890
<v Speaker 5>This represents a store like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well part,</v>

1136
01:03:46.891 --> 01:03:49.050
<v Speaker 5>it's complicated because you shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>have stories.</v>

1137
01:03:49.051 --> 01:03:51.780
<v Speaker 5>But I would say yes but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not,</v>

1138
01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:55.530
<v Speaker 5>it's not so simple because we had </v>
<v Speaker 5>religion at only afterwards.</v>

1139
01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:55.951
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1140
01:03:55.951 --> 01:03:57.280
<v Speaker 5>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why it's,</v>

1141
01:03:57.290 --> 01:03:57.640
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1142
01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:58.473
<v Speaker 5>no I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There should be arrows back and forth </v>

1143
01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:05.790
<v Speaker 5>all the way off but okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so because that's what I said,</v>

1144
01:04:05.791 --> 01:04:06.624
<v Speaker 5>every time a new level emerges,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it modifies all the previous levels and </v>

1145
01:04:10.231 --> 01:04:12.390
<v Speaker 5>all the levels that are in front of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you get,</v>

1146
01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:17.420
<v Speaker 5>you get this Lupo cutting a multi </v>
<v Speaker 5>dimensional causal loop of phenomenon.</v>

1147
01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:22.740
<v Speaker 5>But it does also seem to be a certain </v>
<v Speaker 5>amount of historicity to it.</v>

1148
01:04:22.770 --> 01:04:23.603
<v Speaker 5>Which is to say that rational philosophy</v>
<v Speaker 5>or even philosophy say that at least as </v>

1149
01:04:28.921 --> 01:04:31.500
<v Speaker 5>an emergent property,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe of complex language you use,</v>

1150
01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:35.340
<v Speaker 5>it's only been around for 5,000 years </v>
<v Speaker 5>possibly.</v>

1151
01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:37.860
<v Speaker 5>So it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's hard to say.</v>

1152
01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:44.380
<v Speaker 5>Do is what pre empirical Sharman </v>
<v Speaker 5>engaging comparable to philosophy?</v>

1153
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:47.670
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know either and there's a lot of</v>

1154
01:04:47.671 --> 01:04:48.504
<v Speaker 5>arguments about this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not thinking of this as a simple </v>

1155
01:04:50.551 --> 01:04:51.384
<v Speaker 5>historical progression,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's a historical aspect to it I </v>

1156
01:04:55.291 --> 01:04:55.970
<v Speaker 5>think.</v>

1157
01:04:55.970 --> 01:04:58.530
<v Speaker 2>Whereas here it is a qualitative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1158
01:04:59.140 --> 01:04:59.973
<v Speaker 2>la,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a hierarchy because it seems like </v>

1159
01:05:00.891 --> 01:05:03.770
<v Speaker 2>in is a point at which you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can talk,</v>

1160
01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:07.220
<v Speaker 2>you can start experimenting with not </v>
<v Speaker 2>only objects and facts,</v>

1161
01:05:07.221 --> 01:05:08.510
<v Speaker 2>but also with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with myths.</v>

1162
01:05:08.570 --> 01:05:10.770
<v Speaker 2>And you can start talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>religions in the,</v>

1163
01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:11.613
<v Speaker 2>in an objective manner I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what you want to be able to do </v>

1164
01:05:14.721 --> 01:05:16.160
<v Speaker 2>with what you're teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1165
01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:17.460
<v Speaker 2>that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1166
01:05:17.461 --> 01:05:18.130
<v Speaker 2>but your philosophy</v>

1167
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:18.963
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is thinking about these ideas of </v>

1168
01:05:19.841 --> 01:05:22.180
<v Speaker 5>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Empiricism is actually testing out these</v>

1169
01:05:22.181 --> 01:05:23.014
<v Speaker 5>ideas and behavior and subject to when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you have a philosophy that some of what </v>

1170
01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:30.200
<v Speaker 5>Moses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a formulaic way,</v>

1171
01:05:30.201 --> 01:05:32.950
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's clear a lot of play back and</v>
<v Speaker 5>forth.</v>

1172
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:34.023
<v Speaker 5>I shouldn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I shouldn't have put this in here </v>

1173
01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:35.583
<v Speaker 5>because when you've used [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 5>instead of what it is in terms of what </v>

1174
01:05:38.741 --> 01:05:40.300
<v Speaker 5>it does to the things that came before </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1175
01:05:41.290 --> 01:05:42.400
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>

1176
01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:45.040
<v Speaker 5>That's the match space of food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The reason that it's in there is because</v>

1177
01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:46.420
<v Speaker 5>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a very good point.</v>

1178
01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:47.553
<v Speaker 5>It has an effect on because each of </v>
<v Speaker 5>these emergent abilities has an effect </v>

1179
01:05:51.941 --> 01:05:54.160
<v Speaker 5>on everything that goes before the new </v>
<v Speaker 5>imperialism has,</v>

1180
01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:56.750
<v Speaker 5>has uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>has a dramatic effect on our,</v>

1181
01:05:57.660 --> 01:05:58.493
<v Speaker 5>on our ability to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The stories that were constructed at </v>

1182
01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:04.680
<v Speaker 5>this point is with regards to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>historicity of it.</v>

1183
01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:06.983
<v Speaker 5>It is the case that we organized our </v>
<v Speaker 5>behavior before we understood how we </v>

1184
01:06:09.731 --> 01:06:11.140
<v Speaker 5>did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So our,</v>

1185
01:06:11.350 --> 01:06:16.350
<v Speaker 5>our capacity here in here seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>filing genetically more ancient than our</v>

1186
01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:21.340
<v Speaker 5>task is farther on down the line.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They also seem to be more linguistically</v>

1187
01:06:21.341 --> 01:06:24.010
<v Speaker 5>depending on as you move down the chain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's right.</v>

1188
01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.113
<v Speaker 5>You get a lot of inventory of behavior </v>
<v Speaker 5>and invitation with primates a lot and </v>

1189
01:06:28.081 --> 01:06:30.010
<v Speaker 5>they can move a lot of information </v>
<v Speaker 5>around that way.</v>

1190
01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:30.853
<v Speaker 5>Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cultural Information and certainly it's </v>

1191
01:06:32.741 --> 01:06:35.740
<v Speaker 5>the case that much of the information </v>
<v Speaker 5>that we get from each other,</v>

1192
01:06:36.010 --> 01:06:38.050
<v Speaker 5>hookers it down a level and I think </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's fine.</v>

1193
01:06:38.090 --> 01:06:41.080
<v Speaker 5>Genetically more ancient Merlin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Donald,</v>

1194
01:06:41.081 --> 01:06:43.330
<v Speaker 5>you're never heard of the dorm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was here for a while.</v>

1195
01:06:43.331 --> 01:06:45.910
<v Speaker 5>I was a visiting scholar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You gave a quote a couple of years back.</v>

1196
01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:47.043
<v Speaker 5>He wrote a whole book on about a third </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the book is called the evolution of </v>

1197
01:06:49.631 --> 01:06:53.620
<v Speaker 5>the motor mind on the role of imitation.</v>

1198
01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:54.453
<v Speaker 5>My nieces,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he calls it his culture constructing </v>

1199
01:06:56.831 --> 01:06:57.664
<v Speaker 5>role.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are place that communicating </v>

1200
01:07:00.970 --> 01:07:03.990
<v Speaker 5>information about behaviors about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1201
01:07:04.450 --> 01:07:06.370
<v Speaker 5>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

1202
01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:09.220
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what they're what?</v>

1203
01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:12.520
<v Speaker 5>Not only that their ways of constructing</v>
<v Speaker 5>stories like Elliot,</v>

1204
01:07:12.521 --> 01:07:13.650
<v Speaker 5>he points out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

1205
01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:17.890
<v Speaker 5>in the Polynesians go fishing with a </v>
<v Speaker 5>polynesian goes fishing and feminine are</v>

1206
01:07:17.910 --> 01:07:22.910
<v Speaker 5>Pretty Empirical Polynesian.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He adopts the guys of the ancestral hero</v>

1207
01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:23.973
<v Speaker 5>who first fish for the Polynesians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now Eliana has pointed out that if you </v>

1208
01:07:28.061 --> 01:07:30.820
<v Speaker 5>go back three generations in pretty </v>
<v Speaker 5>literate cultures,</v>

1209
01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:32.073
<v Speaker 5>all the historical events that occurred </v>
<v Speaker 5>before that are sort of telescope into </v>

1210
01:07:35.021 --> 01:07:39.910
<v Speaker 5>the time that existed before the present</v>
<v Speaker 5>time and all they remember is the things</v>

1211
01:07:39.911 --> 01:07:43.480
<v Speaker 5>that they should remember,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is how to act and how to act.</v>

1212
01:07:43.481 --> 01:07:44.314
<v Speaker 5>Which in this case is how to fish,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is to imitate the ritual model </v>

1213
01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:47.933
<v Speaker 5>efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is all the Polynesians collection </v>

1214
01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:52.540
<v Speaker 5>of successful behaviors.</v>

1215
01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:53.673
<v Speaker 5>About how to catch fish that had been </v>
<v Speaker 5>stored and transmitted down the </v>

1216
01:07:56.351 --> 01:07:59.340
<v Speaker 5>generations using this sort of process.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They imitate,</v>

1217
01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:00.193
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1218
01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:01.053
<v Speaker 5>maybe they are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can imagine the Polynesian children </v>

1219
01:08:03.311 --> 01:08:07.900
<v Speaker 5>playing out the fishing routine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a ritual as well.</v>

1220
01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:09.250
<v Speaker 5>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that culture,</v>

1221
01:08:09.251 --> 01:08:11.080
<v Speaker 5>maybe it's also something that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>dramatic.</v>

1222
01:08:11.081 --> 01:08:11.914
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think more more than a historical </v>

1223
01:08:16.491 --> 01:08:17.324
<v Speaker 5>chain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a chain of obstruction and it </v>

1224
01:08:19.101 --> 01:08:21.410
<v Speaker 5>increases as you go down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think it's</v>

1225
01:08:23.690 --> 01:08:24.523
<v Speaker 5>roughly analogous to this behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 5>information moves from here to here to </v>

1226
01:08:27.561 --> 01:08:29.960
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First we are,</v>

1227
01:08:30.350 --> 01:08:31.183
<v Speaker 5>then we make images of reduction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then we tell stories about the end of </v>

1228
01:08:34.011 --> 01:08:34.844
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the action.</v>

1229
01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:40.940
<v Speaker 5>Then we use words to describe the images</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the action that is a store.</v>

1230
01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:42.763
<v Speaker 5>So when I read your Shakespeare in play,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm using words to activate memories in </v>

1231
01:08:49.761 --> 01:08:53.270
<v Speaker 5>your imagination of behavioral patterns </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's where the inflammation is.</v>

1232
01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:55.630
<v Speaker 5>It's not in the words.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why</v>

1233
01:08:57.530 --> 01:08:59.570
<v Speaker 5>people have said that Shakespeare knew </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>

1234
01:08:59.571 --> 01:09:02.510
<v Speaker 5>That for ideas for example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how I tried to think it explicit.</v>

1235
01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:03.683
<v Speaker 5>Shakespearian still implicit still.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say most of your information </v>

1236
01:09:06.230 --> 01:09:08.990
<v Speaker 5>scale here and this system is just </v>
<v Speaker 5>killing me.</v>

1237
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.350
<v Speaker 5>That's what you do with the kids too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyways,</v>

1238
01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:17.203
<v Speaker 5>the point of all of this was to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>describe our stories be constructed and </v>

1239
01:09:20.181 --> 01:09:23.290
<v Speaker 5>you'd asked the questions wrong stories </v>
<v Speaker 5>that are implicit to me.</v>

1240
01:09:23.291 --> 01:09:25.940
<v Speaker 5>You're saying anomalous event,</v>
<v Speaker 5>old curves and you say,</v>

1241
01:09:25.941 --> 01:09:30.941
<v Speaker 5>well frank the mother and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't say what story disrupt.</v>

1242
01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:35.990
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say that's in large part because</v>

1243
01:09:35.991 --> 01:09:40.370
<v Speaker 5>as you move out to larger and larger </v>
<v Speaker 5>scale structures of stories,</v>

1244
01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:45.950
<v Speaker 5>in a sense you moved back in a sense you</v>
<v Speaker 5>move backwards in time.</v>

1245
01:09:46.930 --> 01:09:49.010
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1246
01:09:49.011 --> 01:09:49.844
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because the,</v>

1247
01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:53.810
<v Speaker 5>the stories get more and more archaic </v>
<v Speaker 5>and less and less explicit.</v>

1248
01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:55.093
<v Speaker 5>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could ask the average undergraduate </v>

1249
01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:58.273
<v Speaker 5>what are the presuppositions of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>American constitution and they might be </v>

1250
01:10:00.771 --> 01:10:04.220
<v Speaker 5>able to list off the rights and then you</v>
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>

1251
01:10:04.221 --> 01:10:05.450
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's outside of that?</v>

1252
01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:09.440
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the English Libertarian tradition,</v>

1253
01:10:09.650 --> 01:10:11.650
<v Speaker 5>English new contribution.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1254
01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.430
<v Speaker 5>That's philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's outside of that.</v>

1255
01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:18.860
<v Speaker 5>Well then then you might get the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1256
01:10:18.861 --> 01:10:21.410
<v Speaker 5>it's the Judeo Christian culture in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>western tradition.</v>

1257
01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:22.603
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Things are starting to get pretty vague </v>

1258
01:10:24.081 --> 01:10:24.914
<v Speaker 5>at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is to say that the outer levels </v>

1259
01:10:27.081 --> 01:10:27.914
<v Speaker 5>are still mostly implicit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the question is what does </v>

1260
01:10:31.131 --> 01:10:32.990
<v Speaker 5>implicit me?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I would say,</v>

1261
01:10:32.991 --> 01:10:37.110
<v Speaker 5>well what it means is that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>information there is still lodged mostly</v>

1262
01:10:37.111 --> 01:10:42.111
<v Speaker 5>in image and in coded in behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not explicit.</v>

1263
01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:48.340
<v Speaker 5>So here's another example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a group of two year olds,</v>

1264
01:10:48.370 --> 01:10:49.550
<v Speaker 5>pre verbal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>two year olds,</v>

1265
01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:51.920
<v Speaker 5>because I grew up for two year olds.</v>

1266
01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:54.200
<v Speaker 5>They're all acting in a very complex </v>
<v Speaker 5>manner.</v>

1267
01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:55.603
<v Speaker 5>And you go in there and you study,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're trying to derive rules like </v>

1268
01:10:57.951 --> 01:11:01.130
<v Speaker 5>piaget for their behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It lists all these rules,</v>

1269
01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:04.490
<v Speaker 5>say the children are behaving according </v>
<v Speaker 5>to those worlds,</v>

1270
01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:08.150
<v Speaker 5>which is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't know the rules.</v>

1271
01:11:09.550 --> 01:11:10.383
<v Speaker 5>They can't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now if you say they're behaving good </v>

1272
01:11:13.650 --> 01:11:14.483
<v Speaker 5>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you're saying is that there are </v>

1273
01:11:15.301 --> 01:11:18.090
<v Speaker 5>rules that can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that can be followed but not stated.</v>

1274
01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:20.500
<v Speaker 5>The polls described.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1275
01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:23.300
<v Speaker 5>but okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1276
01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:25.050
<v Speaker 5>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I would say,</v>

1277
01:11:25.051 --> 01:11:25.884
<v Speaker 5>well that's what we're doing to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>rules described our rules and describe </v>

1278
01:11:28.531 --> 01:11:31.440
<v Speaker 5>our behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the behavior precedes the rules.</v>

1279
01:11:32.190 --> 01:11:36.330
<v Speaker 5>So in what form are the rules?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they're not explicit,</v>

1280
01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:38.393
<v Speaker 5>like the children are acting out </v>
<v Speaker 5>patterns that you could use words to </v>

1281
01:11:40.831 --> 01:11:44.080
<v Speaker 5>describe as rules,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where are the patterns?</v>

1282
01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:46.980
<v Speaker 5>What are they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where are they?</v>

1283
01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:48.803
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're certainly in the children's </v>

1284
01:11:49.981 --> 01:11:50.814
<v Speaker 5>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I would say they're coded into </v>

1285
01:11:52.261 --> 01:11:53.094
<v Speaker 5>procedural memory.</v>

1286
01:11:53.210 --> 01:11:55.680
<v Speaker 5>How do we get there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The children,</v>

1287
01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:56.813
<v Speaker 5>the children watched their parents act </v>
<v Speaker 5>and imitating and played with the </v>

1288
01:12:00.661 --> 01:12:05.130
<v Speaker 5>invitation plus in their social </v>
<v Speaker 5>intercourse,</v>

1289
01:12:05.490 --> 01:12:07.530
<v Speaker 5>not only with their parents but with </v>
<v Speaker 5>their parents.</v>

1290
01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:11.550
<v Speaker 5>Their behavior is constantly being </v>
<v Speaker 5>modified by the exchange of reinforcers.</v>

1291
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:15.400
<v Speaker 5>So that constructs a pattern which you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can use rules to described.</v>

1292
01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:16.253
<v Speaker 5>You can use words to describe where you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can tell a story about the child's </v>

1293
01:12:18.451 --> 01:12:20.330
<v Speaker 5>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is what you very [inaudible],</v>

1294
01:12:20.450 --> 01:12:22.750
<v Speaker 5>what he would spend all day studying </v>
<v Speaker 5>kids and he went home.</v>

1295
01:12:22.751 --> 01:12:24.630
<v Speaker 5>You'd said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw the cutest thing today.</v>

1296
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:25.703
<v Speaker 5>Then you tell the story and that would </v>
<v Speaker 5>be a way of getting the information </v>

1297
01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:29.094
<v Speaker 5>about this behavior out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A few levels of abstraction you can </v>

1298
01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:34.590
<v Speaker 5>codify it to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd say you're engaged in this process,</v>

1299
01:12:35.290 --> 01:12:40.290
<v Speaker 5>so</v>
<v Speaker 5>as you go out levels of analysis,</v>

1300
01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:43.500
<v Speaker 5>you go back in time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one way of looking at it.</v>

1301
01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:48.360
<v Speaker 5>You also moved from the explicit to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>implicit increasing.</v>

1302
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:53.040
<v Speaker 5>So when you say an anomalous event </v>
<v Speaker 5>occurs and I can identify the story,</v>

1303
01:12:53.041 --> 01:12:54.330
<v Speaker 5>it affects,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say,</v>

1304
01:12:54.331 --> 01:12:57.550
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's having an impact out of story level</v>

1305
01:12:57.551 --> 01:12:58.500
<v Speaker 5>of it's not explicit.</v>

1306
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:04.680
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

1307
01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:08.400
<v Speaker 5>It's unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's coated in these images.</v>

1308
01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:09.863
<v Speaker 5>It's coded in the myths.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're not aware of just telling stories </v>

1309
01:13:14.150 --> 01:13:15.430
<v Speaker 5>and we're acting it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're,</v>

1310
01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:17.880
<v Speaker 5>we're acting it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But look,</v>

1311
01:13:17.881 --> 01:13:18.714
<v Speaker 5>if if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say you're severely </v>

1312
01:13:19.531 --> 01:13:23.730
<v Speaker 5>psychopathological and you go in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see a psychologist and you say,</v>

1313
01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:28.530
<v Speaker 5>this is my ideal future,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this is always what keeps happening.</v>

1314
01:13:28.830 --> 01:13:29.663
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say there's no isomorphism </v>

1315
01:13:32.670 --> 01:13:35.580
<v Speaker 5>between what's happening here and what's</v>
<v Speaker 5>being stated here,</v>

1316
01:13:35.581 --> 01:13:40.110
<v Speaker 5>which is to say the person's actions act</v>
<v Speaker 5>of a story that the person does not know</v>

1317
01:13:40.111 --> 01:13:40.944
<v Speaker 5>explicitly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is why union said you should know </v>

1318
01:13:43.051 --> 01:13:43.884
<v Speaker 5>the myth that you're lending to me if </v>
<v Speaker 5>outbreaks here and here and Mcclellan </v>

1319
01:13:47.821 --> 01:13:50.580
<v Speaker 5>has noted the same sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's something that is very much</v>

1320
01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:51.493
<v Speaker 5>analogous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He says that that's why he looks at the </v>

1321
01:13:53.761 --> 01:13:54.594
<v Speaker 5>thematic apperception test your explicit</v>
<v Speaker 5>statements about who you are and what </v>

1322
01:13:58.081 --> 01:13:58.680
<v Speaker 5>you want.</v>

1323
01:13:58.680 --> 01:13:59.513
<v Speaker 5>Do not match your episode with </v>
<v Speaker 5>representations and if you want to </v>

1324
01:14:02.161 --> 01:14:04.590
<v Speaker 5>predict behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is to point anyways.</v>

1325
01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:06.330
<v Speaker 5>You look here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not here.</v>

1326
01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:09.180
<v Speaker 5>So when he's looking for things like </v>
<v Speaker 5>need for achievement,</v>

1327
01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:12.180
<v Speaker 5>which I think is really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 5>cause that's Carol and long</v>

1328
01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:16.930
<v Speaker 5>cultures that have a lot of need for </v>
<v Speaker 5>achievement,</v>

1329
01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:17.793
<v Speaker 5>like themes in their children's stories </v>
<v Speaker 5>have higher socioeconomic status and </v>

1330
01:14:21.731 --> 01:14:24.370
<v Speaker 5>that's because those are here in this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the coding here,</v>

1331
01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:26.980
<v Speaker 5>people act them out there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>talk to the kids.</v>

1332
01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:30.970
<v Speaker 5>It's all unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then the question is what is unconscious</v>

1333
01:14:30.971 --> 01:14:32.620
<v Speaker 5>mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what it means.</v>

1334
01:14:32.770 --> 01:14:34.690
<v Speaker 5>It's coated in behavior or it's an </v>
<v Speaker 5>image.</v>

1335
01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:36.033
<v Speaker 5>It's not yet explicit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this is also a way of kind of trying </v>

1336
01:14:39.611 --> 01:14:42.880
<v Speaker 5>to address the idea of the collective </v>
<v Speaker 5>unconscious in a more</v>

1337
01:14:45.010 --> 01:14:47.970
<v Speaker 5>differentiated manner.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See what it might be.</v>

1338
01:14:49.670 --> 01:14:51.020
<v Speaker 5>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but back to my mother.</v>

1339
01:14:51.330 --> 01:14:52.163
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1340
01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:57.770
<v Speaker 5>Every,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything owe my entire life.</v>

1341
01:14:58.580 --> 01:15:01.520
<v Speaker 5>Takes all the energy out of your options</v>
<v Speaker 5>in notes,</v>

1342
01:15:01.950 --> 01:15:03.360
<v Speaker 5>listen way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't tie it in.</v>

1343
01:15:03.370 --> 01:15:06.160
<v Speaker 5>And did you go there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was nothing that I was going to do</v>

1344
01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:09.190
<v Speaker 5>for that I can't do no right or that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't do.</v>

1345
01:15:09.191 --> 01:15:13.510
<v Speaker 5>Now in school serves a purpose</v>
<v Speaker 5>just date,</v>

1346
01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:16.750
<v Speaker 5>which implicitly includes your one goal </v>
<v Speaker 5>as a state.</v>

1347
01:15:17.010 --> 01:15:17.650
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it also,</v>

1348
01:15:17.650 --> 01:15:19.960
<v Speaker 5>it also might,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mortality is a good,</v>

1349
01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:23.770
<v Speaker 5>a good issue because the problem with </v>
<v Speaker 5>with the,</v>

1350
01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:28.480
<v Speaker 5>the dramatic demonstration of mortality </v>
<v Speaker 5>is that it's the form of,</v>

1351
01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:29.373
<v Speaker 5>it's a form of anomalous information </v>
<v Speaker 5>that can Noriko your highest levels of </v>

1352
01:15:32.681 --> 01:15:33.514
<v Speaker 5>stories that I heard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is severe repercussions because </v>

1353
01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:38.720
<v Speaker 5>I'm faced with my own mortality.</v>

1354
01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:43.410
<v Speaker 5>I have no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say that this is more and more,</v>

1355
01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:47.500
<v Speaker 5>more particularly the severe </v>
<v Speaker 5>repercussions are because the story that</v>

1356
01:15:47.501 --> 01:15:48.334
<v Speaker 5>you've been telling yourself no longer </v>
<v Speaker 5>maintains its validity in the light of </v>

1357
01:15:51.491 --> 01:15:52.324
<v Speaker 5>an event.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not dramatic because I would say </v>

1358
01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:55.453
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's an indication that the story </v>

1359
01:15:57.221 --> 01:15:58.054
<v Speaker 5>you've been telling yourself does not </v>
<v Speaker 5>include the fact of mortality as a </v>

1360
01:16:01.061 --> 01:16:05.110
<v Speaker 5>constituent element and is therefore </v>
<v Speaker 5>vulnerable to bad as an intrusive event,</v>

1361
01:16:05.650 --> 01:16:06.483
<v Speaker 5>which is to say you don't have a story </v>
<v Speaker 5>that makes sense of mortality and most </v>

1362
01:16:09.371 --> 01:16:12.250
<v Speaker 5>of the Times</v>
<v Speaker 5>shall we go with go ahead.</v>

1363
01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:13.173
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just going to say also I think a </v>

1364
01:16:15.521 --> 01:16:16.354
<v Speaker 3>mother is a culture of other is the guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>for how to behave in the face of the </v>

1365
01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:22.100
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>

1366
01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:23.660
<v Speaker 5>That's certainly the case officer.</v>

1367
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:25.250
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that way if you lose a mother,</v>

1368
01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:29.570
<v Speaker 3>you've really lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've lost your means of knowing how to</v>

1369
01:16:29.571 --> 01:16:32.600
<v Speaker 3>behave right in the face of anomalous </v>
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>

1370
01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:34.013
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the last of the process because </v>

1371
01:16:34.801 --> 01:16:35.634
<v Speaker 5>you can't go back to your mother and </v>
<v Speaker 5>find out how to deal with new </v>

1372
01:16:37.951 --> 01:16:40.680
<v Speaker 5>information here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's an example.</v>

1373
01:16:40.681 --> 01:16:43.350
<v Speaker 5>That's a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's much simpler than the way I was.</v>

1374
01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:44.233
<v Speaker 5>I was going about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Agoraphobic women often experience a </v>

1375
01:16:48.091 --> 01:16:48.924
<v Speaker 5>dramatic loss in the pre developmental </v>
<v Speaker 5>period of their pathology and </v>

1376
01:16:54.090 --> 01:16:54.923
<v Speaker 5>agoraphobic people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think are people whose stories that </v>

1377
01:16:57.091 --> 01:17:00.900
<v Speaker 5>collapse completely for</v>
<v Speaker 5>fear of,</v>

1378
01:17:00.990 --> 01:17:04.290
<v Speaker 5>it's basically fear of leaving any place</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's viewed as secure.</v>

1379
01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:07.590
<v Speaker 5>So when you used to be called fear of </v>
<v Speaker 5>open spaces,</v>

1380
01:17:07.591 --> 01:17:10.880
<v Speaker 5>but it's more like it's fear of being </v>
<v Speaker 5>away from security,</v>

1381
01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.033
<v Speaker 5>fear to Ventura,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fear of being away from hospitals or </v>

1382
01:17:14.001 --> 01:17:17.750
<v Speaker 5>doctors or actually figures of authority</v>
<v Speaker 5>is really what it boils down to.</v>

1383
01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:21.980
<v Speaker 5>So you're a 45 or 50 year old woman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your husband dies,</v>

1384
01:17:22.410 --> 01:17:25.040
<v Speaker 5>your developmental history is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a dependent child.</v>

1385
01:17:25.041 --> 01:17:25.874
<v Speaker 5>You married at the age of 17 you relied </v>
<v Speaker 5>on your husband to make his decisions </v>

1386
01:17:29.150 --> 01:17:29.983
<v Speaker 5>and he's divorced.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like what's happened is your </v>

1387
01:17:32.631 --> 01:17:33.464
<v Speaker 5>culture has disappeared because your </v>
<v Speaker 5>mode of adaptation was normally what </v>

1388
01:17:37.851 --> 01:17:41.180
<v Speaker 5>does my husband,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's recourse to authority.</v>

1389
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:42.103
<v Speaker 5>So there's a little authoritarian drama </v>
<v Speaker 5>going on in your family and the tyrant </v>

1390
01:17:46.050 --> 01:17:50.590
<v Speaker 5>and became just die a your own thorough </v>
<v Speaker 5>information.</v>

1391
01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:57.080
<v Speaker 5>Specific goals</v>
<v Speaker 5>under what circumstances?</v>

1392
01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:05.060
<v Speaker 5>Either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1393
01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:07.160
<v Speaker 5>either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a huge,</v>

1394
01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:09.633
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So either it's a huge impact because </v>

1395
01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:13.263
<v Speaker 5>there are some</v>
<v Speaker 5>super story implicit in which having </v>

1396
01:18:18.201 --> 01:18:19.880
<v Speaker 5>your mother is a big part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1397
01:18:19.881 --> 01:18:24.881
<v Speaker 5>Realize this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>find that story somewhere or you've lost</v>

1398
01:18:25.131 --> 01:18:27.900
<v Speaker 5>your mode of adaptation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is that's another cost,</v>

1399
01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:29.353
<v Speaker 5>which is the process.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your ability now to take Allen's </v>

1400
01:18:33.290 --> 01:18:38.290
<v Speaker 5>information guide and then reintegrate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You feel you've lost that,</v>

1401
01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:41.410
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That kind of grant.</v>

1402
01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:43.670
<v Speaker 5>That is literally the case with </v>
<v Speaker 5>children.</v>

1403
01:18:44.130 --> 01:18:45.050
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they lose it,</v>

1404
01:18:45.051 --> 01:18:47.570
<v Speaker 5>their parents,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like because they're motivated.</v>

1405
01:18:47.571 --> 01:18:51.290
<v Speaker 5>The childhood mode of adaptation is </v>
<v Speaker 5>authoritarian more or less.</v>

1406
01:18:51.291 --> 01:18:53.210
<v Speaker 5>It's like if something anomalous </v>
<v Speaker 5>happens,</v>

1407
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:56.180
<v Speaker 5>I asked mom and dad and they tell me </v>
<v Speaker 5>what to do,</v>

1408
01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:00.170
<v Speaker 5>so when you lose a parent at that age,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you literally do use,</v>

1409
01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:03.020
<v Speaker 5>do lose your process.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an authoritarian process,</v>

1410
01:19:03.021 --> 01:19:06.240
<v Speaker 5>but it's necessarily most of them to </v>
<v Speaker 5>kids do some exploratory.</v>

1411
01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:11.343
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well I was just speaking roughly </v>

1412
01:19:13.491 --> 01:19:15.300
<v Speaker 5>politically.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just rich.</v>

1413
01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:18.380
<v Speaker 5>It's like there are different modes of </v>
<v Speaker 5>adaptation.</v>

1414
01:19:18.410 --> 01:19:21.530
<v Speaker 5>Three of them actually I think one is </v>
<v Speaker 5>recourse to authority.</v>

1415
01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:24.380
<v Speaker 5>One is decadence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he just give up.</v>

1416
01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:25.813
<v Speaker 5>The other is the pattern that we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to outline and society's waiver </v>

1417
01:19:28.641 --> 01:19:32.600
<v Speaker 5>between the first two because sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 5>the solution is authoritarianism.</v>

1418
01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:34.250
<v Speaker 5>There's too many.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's,</v>

1419
01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:35.113
<v Speaker 5>there's too many refugees,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's close the borders and enforce </v>

1420
01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:38.753
<v Speaker 5>uniformity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or our culture is threatened by forces </v>

1421
01:19:41.421 --> 01:19:43.100
<v Speaker 5>that we can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can't tolerate,</v>

1422
01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:45.790
<v Speaker 5>well we'll just give up the parish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's what happened.</v>

1423
01:19:45.791 --> 01:19:46.624
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] enrollments for example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like when they were fighting over </v>

1424
01:19:49.321 --> 01:19:50.154
<v Speaker 5>the gun,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had an army to do this perfectly </v>

1425
01:19:51.141 --> 01:19:51.974
<v Speaker 5>sufficient to repel the invading forces </v>
<v Speaker 5>being too many gods and died of </v>

1426
01:19:55.380 --> 01:19:58.350
<v Speaker 5>indigestion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1427
01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:02.720
<v Speaker 5>and then so then the Dallas would say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well if your culture is out of whack,</v>

1428
01:20:02.721 --> 01:20:04.860
<v Speaker 5>it's because there's too much chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>furthers,</v>

1429
01:20:04.910 --> 01:20:05.580
<v Speaker 5>too much order.</v>

1430
01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:06.890
<v Speaker 5>It was too much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He ended or there's too much.</v>

1431
01:20:07.410 --> 01:20:08.243
<v Speaker 5>You have to put the balance back yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the proper mode of adaptations </v>

1432
01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:12.863
<v Speaker 5>walking down the line.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then that's another example of what </v>

1433
01:20:15.631 --> 01:20:19.380
<v Speaker 5>we're trying to lay out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can I just say something maybe coming on</v>

1434
01:20:19.381 --> 01:20:21.670
<v Speaker 5>this other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it seems to me that what,</v>

1435
01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:22.613
<v Speaker 5>what this is to say this whole picture </v>
<v Speaker 5>to put quite simply is that we are </v>

1436
01:20:25.891 --> 01:20:26.724
<v Speaker 5>creatures of habit and your story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is the domain of the known </v>

1437
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:35.760
<v Speaker 5>includes well is really everything and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that is experience which includes all of</v>

1438
01:20:35.761 --> 01:20:36.594
<v Speaker 5>your history and your mother is one of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the most fundamental constituents of </v>

1439
01:20:39.751 --> 01:20:40.584
<v Speaker 5>your entire history.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So even if it doesn't have anything to </v>

1440
01:20:43.111 --> 01:20:47.340
<v Speaker 5>do specifically with any of your higher </v>
<v Speaker 5>level goals,</v>

1441
01:20:47.490 --> 01:20:51.450
<v Speaker 5>it's still blowing holes in your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in your story,</v>

1442
01:20:51.870 --> 01:20:55.890
<v Speaker 5>which disregulates your some of your </v>
<v Speaker 5>stories for sure.</v>

1443
01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:56.873
<v Speaker 5>But I mean the stories I was going home </v>
<v Speaker 5>for Christmas to visit her mother for </v>

1444
01:20:59.101 --> 01:20:59.934
<v Speaker 5>example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is pretty much that little thing that's </v>

1445
01:21:02.061 --> 01:21:02.940
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The larger,</v>

1446
01:21:03.870 --> 01:21:07.710
<v Speaker 5>the more</v>
<v Speaker 5>trauma it's going to cost when it's gone</v>

1447
01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:09.830
<v Speaker 5>because the more you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more you count on it,</v>

1448
01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:11.720
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The morning depends on absolutely.</v>

1449
01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:16.170
<v Speaker 5>And that sees because the question we're</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to answer is here is what can you</v>

1450
01:21:16.171 --> 01:21:18.360
<v Speaker 5>depend on when there isn't anything to </v>
<v Speaker 5>depend on?</v>

1451
01:21:18.630 --> 01:21:19.463
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like if you lose a little of the </v>

1452
01:21:20.641 --> 01:21:22.230
<v Speaker 5>coastline,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not so surprising,</v>

1453
01:21:22.231 --> 01:21:24.420
<v Speaker 5>but if something drops out of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>middle,</v>

1454
01:21:24.421 --> 01:21:25.290
<v Speaker 5>it's very peculiar.</v>

1455
01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:35.673
<v Speaker 5>Kind of reminds me of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems to me girls do tend to go from </v>

1456
01:21:39.571 --> 01:21:43.470
<v Speaker 5>here to here without descending to this </v>
<v Speaker 5>level.</v>

1457
01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:48.300
<v Speaker 5>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the</v>

1458
01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:54.400
<v Speaker 5>more of an influence on the adolescent </v>
<v Speaker 5>female.</v>

1459
01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:59.190
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never really,</v>

1460
01:21:59.310 --> 01:22:00.143
<v Speaker 5>I've never really thought about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never considered the possibility of </v>

1461
01:22:03.511 --> 01:22:04.344
<v Speaker 5>sex differences in this process.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm sure that there are sex </v>

1462
01:22:06.781 --> 01:22:08.450
<v Speaker 5>differences.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1463
01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:13.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm not even sure what the main,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so</v>

1464
01:22:15.710 --> 01:22:18.160
<v Speaker 5>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you said there are three months,</v>

1465
01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:20.353
<v Speaker 5>what do you call</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was used term for Nietzsche called </v>

1466
01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:30.053
<v Speaker 5>to power,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I think was basically what he was </v>

1467
01:22:31.801 --> 01:22:32.700
<v Speaker 5>after.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

1468
01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:35.110
<v Speaker 5>call it the camel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The child.</v>

1469
01:22:35.970 --> 01:22:37.450
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

1470
01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:38.703
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1471
01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:41.200
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1472
01:22:41.550 --> 01:22:45.860
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what you'd call</v>
<v Speaker 5>the third way is,</v>

1473
01:22:46.290 --> 01:22:50.130
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's descriptive terms of all </v>
<v Speaker 5>sorts of business to be used to describe</v>

1474
01:22:50.131 --> 01:22:51.080
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's also,</v>

1475
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:52.103
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see books alluded to this at the </v>

1476
01:22:53.971 --> 01:22:54.631
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the time,</v>

1477
01:22:54.631 --> 01:22:57.060
<v Speaker 5>like the razors edge by Somerset Mall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

1478
01:22:57.170 --> 01:23:02.170
<v Speaker 5>That's another image of this path </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's balanced between to balance</v>

1479
01:23:03.361 --> 01:23:06.610
<v Speaker 5>between chaos and order basically to </v>
<v Speaker 5>raise money is literally amazing.</v>

1480
01:23:06.690 --> 01:23:07.523
<v Speaker 5>Sandwich summer stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mom's book is about something that </v>

1481
01:23:09.041 --> 01:23:14.041
<v Speaker 5>you've discovered that I go into.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The East is the hero culture.</v>

1482
01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:31.550
<v Speaker 5>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

1483
01:23:34.730 --> 01:23:36.640
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to show you the notion of these</v>

1484
01:23:36.641 --> 01:23:37.474
<v Speaker 5>nested stories and also the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 5>anomalous inflammation can occur within </v>

1485
01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:50.530
<v Speaker 5>any bounded domain and range and that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>something that's very interesting.</v>

1486
01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:51.933
<v Speaker 5>George Kelly said</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's also the case that anomalous </v>

1487
01:23:55.721 --> 01:23:58.840
<v Speaker 5>information range of effect and there is</v>
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

1488
01:23:58.930 --> 01:24:01.900
<v Speaker 5>there are occasions where you encounter </v>
<v Speaker 5>a piece of anonymous information.</v>

1489
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:02.743
<v Speaker 5>It might take decades to recuts have off</v>
<v Speaker 5>on all the levels of analysis that it's </v>

1490
01:24:07.901 --> 01:24:10.270
<v Speaker 5>actually a challenge because you have to</v>
<v Speaker 5>figure it out.</v>

1491
01:24:10.630 --> 01:24:13.000
<v Speaker 5>I just think something like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's take your example again.</v>

1492
01:24:13.001 --> 01:24:13.834
<v Speaker 5>If a parent dies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are implications for that at all </v>

1493
01:24:17.861 --> 01:24:18.694
<v Speaker 5>sorts of different levels of analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of which might not become evidence </v>

1494
01:24:21.311 --> 01:24:22.144
<v Speaker 5>for for years told them this story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was thinking about this more </v>

1495
01:24:26.411 --> 01:24:30.910
<v Speaker 5>particular both niches,</v>
<v Speaker 5>notion of who definitely gone every time</v>

1496
01:24:30.911 --> 01:24:33.010
<v Speaker 5>one of these levels of analysis </v>
<v Speaker 5>collapses and that's up.</v>

1497
01:24:33.011 --> 01:24:36.400
<v Speaker 5>Danny definitely gone so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The God that rules,</v>

1498
01:24:37.450 --> 01:24:38.410
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ancient Romans,</v>

1499
01:24:38.411 --> 01:24:42.220
<v Speaker 5>they used to think that every different </v>
<v Speaker 5>room that had it go off and I guess in a</v>

1500
01:24:42.221 --> 01:24:46.490
<v Speaker 5>sense what they were alluding to was the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fact that you have different patterns of</v>

1501
01:24:46.491 --> 01:24:50.030
<v Speaker 5>goal directed activity in every specific</v>
<v Speaker 5>contexts and they should be doing,</v>

1502
01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:52.553
<v Speaker 5>and I read you that that India met the </v>
<v Speaker 5>other day about endless cycles of </v>

1503
01:24:57.010 --> 01:25:00.430
<v Speaker 5>embedded creation and destruction and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what these,</v>

1504
01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:01.593
<v Speaker 5>each of these stories goes through this </v>
<v Speaker 5>process of descent in reconstruction at </v>

1505
01:25:04.991 --> 01:25:08.680
<v Speaker 5>every different level of analysis when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you encounter something really anomalous</v>

1506
01:25:08.681 --> 01:25:12.250
<v Speaker 5>that Lowe's who knows how many new </v>
<v Speaker 5>story.</v>

1507
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:14.410
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess the only way to think about that</v>

1508
01:25:14.411 --> 01:25:17.950
<v Speaker 5>as in terms of the contact of cultures </v>
<v Speaker 5>that had appeared before the isolated.</v>

1509
01:25:19.150 --> 01:25:21.520
<v Speaker 5>So they did their whole developmental </v>
<v Speaker 5>history has been separate.</v>

1510
01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:24.500
<v Speaker 5>Then they come together and some </v>
<v Speaker 5>terrible catastrophe usually.</v>

1511
01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:26.980
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a catastrophe or to me,</v>

1512
01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:30.880
<v Speaker 5>this opportunity</v>
<v Speaker 5>ends on the circumstances</v>

1513
01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:39.490
<v Speaker 5>with regards to automation for social </v>
<v Speaker 5>confidence is</v>

1514
01:25:48.010 --> 01:25:50.170
<v Speaker 5>the thing that people are motivated to </v>
<v Speaker 5>avoid.</v>

1515
01:25:50.171 --> 01:25:51.004
<v Speaker 5>Above all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the outside thing are involuntary high </v>

1516
01:25:54.881 --> 01:25:55.714
<v Speaker 5>level challenges to stories,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they're were very much motivated to </v>

1517
01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:07.080
<v Speaker 5>eliminate or ignore or repress or </v>
<v Speaker 5>otherwise</v>

1518
01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:09.853
<v Speaker 5>obliterate any evidence that suggests </v>
<v Speaker 5>that are higher level structures about </v>

1519
01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:15.980
<v Speaker 5>or insufficient because when we lose </v>
<v Speaker 5>those,</v>

1520
01:26:16.250 --> 01:26:17.660
<v Speaker 5>we lose everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's nested loop.</v>

1521
01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:22.340
<v Speaker 5>That's the</v>
<v Speaker 5>anomaly.</v>

1522
01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:23.533
<v Speaker 5>An anomaly that's relevant at one level </v>
<v Speaker 5>tends to demolish all the levels that </v>

1523
01:26:26.661 --> 01:26:30.660
<v Speaker 5>are inside of all those levels inside of</v>
<v Speaker 5>dependent on that store.</v>

1524
01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:43.640
<v Speaker 5>Next class we're going to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 5>some of them.</v>

1525
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:46.183
<v Speaker 5>We're going to talk about some of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ways that anomalous information </v>

1526
01:26:48.150 --> 01:26:53.150
<v Speaker 5>manifests itself and the basic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the easiest way to conceptualize that is</v>

1527
01:26:55.170 --> 01:26:58.970
<v Speaker 5>that anomaly can occur at any of these </v>
<v Speaker 5>levels of analysis,</v>

1528
01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:03.200
<v Speaker 5>so the mere presence of someone who </v>
<v Speaker 5>behaves differently,</v>

1529
01:27:03.201 --> 01:27:04.034
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can constitute a challenge to the </v>

1530
01:27:06.081 --> 01:27:06.914
<v Speaker 5>integrity of your stories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The stories that someone tells us that </v>

1531
01:27:10.281 --> 01:27:13.030
<v Speaker 5>the Ford,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's another example of that.</v>

1532
01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:16.310
<v Speaker 5>We'll be here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alternative miss can wreak havoc on your</v>

1533
01:27:16.311 --> 01:27:16.971
<v Speaker 5>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can have.</v>

1534
01:27:16.971 --> 01:27:21.740
<v Speaker 5>Certainly the case when you think about </v>
<v Speaker 5>that in terms of the clash of religions,</v>

1535
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:27.230
<v Speaker 5>new ideas can blow your stories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And all of this information comes in all</v>

1536
01:27:27.231 --> 01:27:31.390
<v Speaker 5>of those guys as and their stories about</v>
<v Speaker 5>their stories,</v>

1537
01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:35.130
<v Speaker 5>about his appearance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>each of those guys.</v>

1538
01:27:35.770 --> 01:27:36.603
<v Speaker 5>So we're going to talk a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 5>about how anomalous information </v>

1539
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:42.590
<v Speaker 5>manifests itself and then the core </v>
<v Speaker 5>switches into the last half,</v>

1540
01:27:42.591 --> 01:27:46.810
<v Speaker 5>which is much more focused on the movie.</v>

1541
01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:55.120
<v Speaker 5>So we have time</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1542
01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:09.180
<v Speaker 5>but at the same time there are </v>
<v Speaker 5>individual differences.</v>

1543
01:28:09.190 --> 01:28:10.023
<v Speaker 5>I mean you've ever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every individual's episodic and </v>

1544
01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:15.110
<v Speaker 5>procedural memories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1545
01:28:15.111 --> 01:28:16.260
<v Speaker 5>Well I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think,</v>

1546
01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:17.173
<v Speaker 5>I think it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>gender roles and the West are becoming </v>

1547
01:28:21.801 --> 01:28:25.490
<v Speaker 5>more and more for many cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a strict distinction between the</v>

1548
01:28:25.491 --> 01:28:26.324
<v Speaker 5>sexes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There were native native American </v>

1549
01:28:27.591 --> 01:28:30.170
<v Speaker 5>cultures where the men and the women </v>
<v Speaker 5>spoke different languages.</v>

1550
01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:32.630
<v Speaker 5>So it depends on the culture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it certainly,</v>

1551
01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:36.310
<v Speaker 5>there are many cultures where,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where women live that that's,</v>

1552
01:28:36.450 --> 01:28:41.360
<v Speaker 5>that's the case where we're women had a </v>
<v Speaker 5>domain of activity that was their sacred</v>

1553
01:28:41.361 --> 01:28:42.194
<v Speaker 5>domain and the same with the men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there was no cross talk to speak of </v>

1554
01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:47.673
<v Speaker 5>women to a</v>
<v Speaker 5>traditional domains of women have been </v>

1555
01:28:55.230 --> 01:29:00.230
<v Speaker 5>closed cloth making pottery and </v>
<v Speaker 5>agriculture three nontrivial domains.</v>

1556
01:29:02.660 --> 01:29:03.493
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

1557
01:29:04.140 --> 01:29:05.460
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course.</v>

1558
01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:06.693
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was thinking more specifically </v>

1559
01:29:09.451 --> 01:29:11.780
<v Speaker 5>cultural issues.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So yeah.</v>

1560
01:29:12.130 --> 01:29:13.380
<v Speaker 5>And then I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well yes,</v>

1561
01:29:13.420 --> 01:29:16.970
<v Speaker 5>the procedural memories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well just to a certain agreement.</v>

1562
01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:22.270
<v Speaker 4>This is there in terms of their habits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Richard Cory story pretty different.</v>

1563
01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:25.773
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1564
01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:32.193
<v Speaker 5>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is something that I have agreed </v>

1565
01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:33.993
<v Speaker 5>work though cause I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of the feminine images in </v>

1566
01:29:37.811 --> 01:29:38.644
<v Speaker 5>mythology seem to me to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>representations of the unknown rather </v>

1567
01:29:42.821 --> 01:29:46.030
<v Speaker 5>than representations of the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And like Newman would say,</v>

1568
01:29:46.250 --> 01:29:50.980
<v Speaker 5>well the feminine feminine consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 5>construed as the hero is masculine.</v>

1569
01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:51.933
<v Speaker 5>Symbolically it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it has nothing to do with gender except </v>

1570
01:29:57.730 --> 01:30:02.730
<v Speaker 5>I suppose perhaps that</v>
<v Speaker 5>the aztecs temps for the Aztecs,</v>

1571
01:30:04.810 --> 01:30:08.130
<v Speaker 5>a woman who died in childbirth went to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the same heaven.</v>

1572
01:30:08.140 --> 01:30:11.050
<v Speaker 5>The warriors when two if they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>killed in battle.</v>

1573
01:30:13.220 --> 01:30:15.480
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I would say even there and that's,</v>

1574
01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:20.620
<v Speaker 5>that's pretty much good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even the bylaws,</v>

1575
01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:21.913
<v Speaker 5>the most biological aspect of a woman's </v>
<v Speaker 5>role was construed as heroic in that in </v>

1576
01:30:26.571 --> 01:30:30.530
<v Speaker 5>that particular case.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So as as equivalent to two more.</v>

1577
01:30:32.670 --> 01:30:35.730
<v Speaker 4>What about the idea that the myths that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are part of our culture,</v>

1578
01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:36.713
<v Speaker 4>it's Disney or something would you </v>
<v Speaker 4>showed us how to bless her prince </v>

1579
01:30:39.471 --> 01:30:40.304
<v Speaker 4>charming figure who identifies with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hero and it goes out and conquers this </v>

1580
01:30:44.290 --> 01:30:45.123
<v Speaker 4>dragon whatever for the principals or </v>
<v Speaker 4>rescues the princess and so that people </v>

1581
01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:55.380
<v Speaker 4>will identify along gender lines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Men are taught to identify,</v>

1582
01:30:55.390 --> 01:30:56.223
<v Speaker 4>her boys are taught to identify with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>friends and to what extent women are </v>

1583
01:30:58.911 --> 01:31:03.740
<v Speaker 4>taught to identify with the sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Barbie doll with the princess or the the</v>

1584
01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:04.420
<v Speaker 4>sort of,</v>

1585
01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:05.253
<v Speaker 5>well this is another issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like I think one of the reasons </v>

1586
01:31:08.501 --> 01:31:13.210
<v Speaker 5>that the fairy tales tend to port.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This isn't nice.</v>

1587
01:31:13.270 --> 01:31:14.103
<v Speaker 5>Nice idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In light in the Aztec notion that fairy </v>

1588
01:31:16.611 --> 01:31:19.540
<v Speaker 5>tales tend to portray,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we even say us dependent.</v>

1589
01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:21.820
<v Speaker 5>So for someone to rescue them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1590
01:31:21.850 --> 01:31:22.683
<v Speaker 5>I would say the reason for that is </v>
<v Speaker 5>because this is my own personal </v>

1591
01:31:24.971 --> 01:31:29.710
<v Speaker 5>interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is the in more traditional cultures,</v>

1592
01:31:29.711 --> 01:31:30.544
<v Speaker 5>which I would just say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or cultures that don't have access to </v>

1593
01:31:32.381 --> 01:31:33.214
<v Speaker 5>reliable birth control,</v>
<v Speaker 5>women aren't necessarily put into a </v>

1594
01:31:35.851 --> 01:31:39.130
<v Speaker 5>dependent position by the biology and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1595
01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:40.113
<v Speaker 5>and the notion of heroism that those </v>
<v Speaker 5>tails sort of portray is voluntary </v>

1596
01:31:44.111 --> 01:31:44.944
<v Speaker 5>acceptance of that rule and voluntary </v>
<v Speaker 5>acceptance of the necessity for a </v>

1597
01:31:48.731 --> 01:31:49.564
<v Speaker 5>protracted period of dependence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's reasonable to construe that as </v>

1598
01:31:52.271 --> 01:31:53.104
<v Speaker 5>a form of hero is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's why the Aztecs had this </v>

1599
01:31:56.201 --> 01:31:58.810
<v Speaker 5>particular attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Biology,</v>

1600
01:31:58.811 --> 01:32:00.610
<v Speaker 5>Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 5>biology is destiny.</v>

1601
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.590
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's true and not true.</v>

1602
01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:05.110
<v Speaker 5>It's not so much destiny when you have </v>
<v Speaker 5>the birth control pill,</v>

1603
01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:07.600
<v Speaker 5>but without it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a big chunk of destiny there.</v>

1604
01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:09.333
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's voluntarily facing the things </v>

1605
01:32:11.441 --> 01:32:16.380
<v Speaker 5>that have to be faced that constitutes </v>
<v Speaker 5>Hiro is so that,</v>

1606
01:32:17.610 --> 01:32:20.940
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how that applies to our age</v>
<v Speaker 5>in an age of birth control.</v>

1607
01:32:21.530 --> 01:32:24.510
<v Speaker 5>Still the matter of taught to be here at</v>
<v Speaker 5>the women I've talked to.</v>

1608
01:32:24.550 --> 01:32:25.450
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

1609
01:32:25.451 --> 01:32:28.090
<v Speaker 5>there hasn't been enough time for our </v>
<v Speaker 5>stories to the change.</v>

1610
01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:31.180
<v Speaker 5>And second,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in many ways things haven't changed.</v>

1611
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:33.220
<v Speaker 5>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you have a baby,</v>

1612
01:32:34.150 --> 01:32:35.610
<v Speaker 5>there's a year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It depends.</v>

1613
01:32:35.650 --> 01:32:38.710
<v Speaker 5>You can do with lots of ways you can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can put the baby in daycare.</v>

1614
01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:40.593
<v Speaker 5>Well that's a solution of a trump.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All that means is that the dependency </v>

1615
01:32:43.591 --> 01:32:47.170
<v Speaker 5>stage is transferred to someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's still there.</v>

1616
01:32:47.171 --> 01:32:50.020
<v Speaker 5>It's just be moved usually down the </v>
<v Speaker 5>socioeconomic ladder.</v>

1617
01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:51.273
<v Speaker 5>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you don't choose that you have a one </v>

1618
01:32:53.231 --> 01:32:54.064
<v Speaker 5>year period where there's something </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's absolutely dependent on you to </v>

1619
01:32:58.511 --> 01:32:59.344
<v Speaker 5>the degree that it would be really </v>
<v Speaker 5>useful for you to be able to be </v>

1620
01:33:01.541 --> 01:33:02.374
<v Speaker 5>dependent on someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So to the degree that child rearing </v>

1621
01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:11.350
<v Speaker 5>still is a feminine role and I think </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be a long time before that</v>

1622
01:33:12.670 --> 01:33:15.010
<v Speaker 5>that changes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it ever changes,</v>

1623
01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:20.220
<v Speaker 5>who knows what will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The notion of voluntary dependency still</v>

1624
01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:25.420
<v Speaker 5>has an aspect of truth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how I look at it.</v>

1625
01:33:26.430 --> 01:33:27.263
<v Speaker 5>And it's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's lots of people who've </v>

1626
01:33:28.331 --> 01:33:30.670
<v Speaker 5>wanted to rewrite fairy tales.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1627
01:33:30.671 --> 01:33:31.504
<v Speaker 5>because they have sexist things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But Shelly pointed out something </v>

1628
01:33:34.181 --> 01:33:36.880
<v Speaker 5>interesting in her last essay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tell you the three little pigs,</v>

1629
01:33:36.881 --> 01:33:37.714
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they keep building houses and you get </v>

1630
01:33:38.441 --> 01:33:40.660
<v Speaker 5>stronger and stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The wolf closed them down,</v>

1631
01:33:40.661 --> 01:33:41.494
<v Speaker 5>but finally they build a stone house or </v>
<v Speaker 5>a brick house and the wolf climate </v>

1632
01:33:44.681 --> 01:33:45.514
<v Speaker 5>through the chimney,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he falls into a bowl of water and </v>

1633
01:33:46.631 --> 01:33:47.570
<v Speaker 5>then the pigs eat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cook,</v>

1634
01:33:47.571 --> 01:33:48.404
<v Speaker 5>and eat him.</v>

1635
01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:49.293
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she always pointed out that in the </v>

1636
01:33:49.811 --> 01:33:50.644
<v Speaker 5>sanitized versions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wolf just pops down the fire decisions </v>

1637
01:33:54.340 --> 01:33:55.173
<v Speaker 5>his tail,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he goes back up through the chimney </v>

1638
01:33:55.991 --> 01:33:57.940
<v Speaker 5>and he gets away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She meant,</v>

1639
01:33:57.941 --> 01:33:59.620
<v Speaker 5>she pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1640
01:34:00.130 --> 01:34:00.963
<v Speaker 5>the fact of having constructive this </v>
<v Speaker 5>fortress in the proper manner allowed </v>

1641
01:34:04.990 --> 01:34:08.980
<v Speaker 5>enough of the external unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 5>symbolized by the wolf to enter.</v>

1642
01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:13.240
<v Speaker 5>We can be prepared and to simulate it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now you say,</v>

1643
01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:14.680
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a violent story.</v>

1644
01:34:14.690 --> 01:34:16.090
<v Speaker 5>The poor wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1645
01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:21.010
<v Speaker 5>it's like you're thinking here about </v>
<v Speaker 5>something that's all encoded here.</v>

1646
01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:22.400
<v Speaker 5>So you mess around with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you say,</v>

1647
01:34:22.410 --> 01:34:23.243
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it'd be much nicer if the wolf gone </v>

1648
01:34:24.130 --> 01:34:24.881
<v Speaker 5>away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>

1649
01:34:24.881 --> 01:34:25.714
<v Speaker 5>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there's no story that we just like </v>

1650
01:34:27.130 --> 01:34:30.820
<v Speaker 5>the reason you built the stone house,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so that you can cook any the wolf.</v>

1651
01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:34.300
<v Speaker 5>Well you lose the graphic imagery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you lose the story.</v>

1652
01:34:34.510 --> 01:34:38.830
<v Speaker 5>And that's the problem with messing </v>
<v Speaker 5>about with traditional tales.</v>

1653
01:34:38.831 --> 01:34:39.664
<v Speaker 5>I mean I can understand why people want </v>
<v Speaker 5>to do it and there's lots of traditions </v>

1654
01:34:41.681 --> 01:34:43.330
<v Speaker 5>perhaps than artists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so beneficial.</v>

1655
01:34:44.290 --> 01:34:45.123
<v Speaker 5>But</v>
<v Speaker 5>it might be good to understand that </v>

1656
01:34:48.011 --> 01:34:48.844
<v Speaker 5>before they are trans transformed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The other thing is is that we do not </v>

1657
01:34:51.701 --> 01:34:55.240
<v Speaker 5>have an answer to the question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What constitutes a valid feminine idea?</v>

1658
01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:01.040
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well just about the feminine part of the</v>

1659
01:35:01.041 --> 01:35:03.770
<v Speaker 3>wanting to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me that what the feminine,</v>

1660
01:35:04.250 --> 01:35:05.083
<v Speaker 3>the Feminine</v>
<v Speaker 3>counterpart of exploratory behavior is </v>

1661
01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:10.973
<v Speaker 3>endurance of the rather than exploration</v>
<v Speaker 3>feed meals through myth are taught to </v>

1662
01:35:17.331 --> 01:35:18.164
<v Speaker 3>endure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not necessarily dependency I don't </v>

1663
01:35:20.271 --> 01:35:22.190
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just just to endure it,</v>

1664
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:25.370
<v Speaker 3>to sit there and write it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1665
01:35:25.610 --> 01:35:28.850
<v Speaker 3>it seems to me that that in fairy tales,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gannon mythology,</v>

1666
01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:30.073
<v Speaker 3>that's what the four females have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't get to actively explore the </v>

1667
01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:37.200
<v Speaker 3>and just endure it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's how they,</v>

1668
01:35:37.201 --> 01:35:40.370
<v Speaker 3>we come here because the thing is if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a problem,</v>

1669
01:35:40.371 --> 01:35:41.204
<v Speaker 3>there's two things you can do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can either change how you're </v>

1670
01:35:42.650 --> 01:35:43.483
<v Speaker 3>accurate.</v>

1671
01:35:43.890 --> 01:35:44.723
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do think it's the case among human </v>

1672
01:35:49.681 --> 01:35:54.681
<v Speaker 5>beings in general</v>
<v Speaker 5>are view down is both more necessary.</v>

1673
01:35:55.861 --> 01:35:58.560
<v Speaker 5>I'm more expendable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>both at the same time.</v>

1674
01:35:58.770 --> 01:35:59.603
<v Speaker 5>So I met Andrew sent off to war foods,</v>
<v Speaker 5>got a lot of useless side less than men </v>

1675
01:36:03.061 --> 01:36:03.841
<v Speaker 5>hanging road.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1676
01:36:03.841 --> 01:36:06.810
<v Speaker 5>that's a good thing for them to do and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's basically how society worked.</v>

1677
01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:09.330
<v Speaker 5>Boys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all boys fight wars,</v>

1678
01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:10.793
<v Speaker 5>they're expendable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The thing about something that's </v>

1679
01:36:12.271 --> 01:36:13.104
<v Speaker 5>expendable is then it can also be </v>
<v Speaker 5>something that's very creative because </v>

1680
01:36:16.170 --> 01:36:19.930
<v Speaker 5>exploration is dangerous and if you lose</v>
<v Speaker 5>a few adolescent males while they're off</v>

1681
01:36:21.090 --> 01:36:22.650
<v Speaker 5>exploring around,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1682
01:36:23.850 --> 01:36:25.160
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1683
01:36:25.380 --> 01:36:26.910
<v Speaker 5>tough luck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas women,</v>

1684
01:36:27.180 --> 01:36:28.500
<v Speaker 5>well you to have them around.</v>

1685
01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:32.380
<v Speaker 3>Well that's all that goes to my question</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I asked you yesterday.</v>

1686
01:36:32.381 --> 01:36:33.214
<v Speaker 3>Can there be too many heroes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me there's only a certain </v>

1687
01:36:36.191 --> 01:36:40.420
<v Speaker 3>amount of creativity that any society </v>
<v Speaker 3>can endure at a given time.</v>

1688
01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:43.620
<v Speaker 3>If you've got everybody out there trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to bring the end.</v>

1689
01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:46.780
<v Speaker 5>That's why I mentioned today that there </v>
<v Speaker 5>are three patterns.</v>

1690
01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:49.450
<v Speaker 5>Adaptation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is recourse to authority.</v>

1691
01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:54.910
<v Speaker 5>That's the authoritarian.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's whatever we're talking about and</v>

1692
01:36:54.911 --> 01:36:55.744
<v Speaker 5>there's decadence and decadence occurs </v>
<v Speaker 5>when under the guise of constant </v>

1693
01:37:00.401 --> 01:37:02.520
<v Speaker 5>creative behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything he's on the fine,</v>

1694
01:37:03.130 --> 01:37:06.830
<v Speaker 5>but it's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your old man says when you explore,</v>

1695
01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.150
<v Speaker 5>you bring your culture along with you </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that because you're right,</v>

1696
01:37:10.151 --> 01:37:14.440
<v Speaker 5>you're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean constant heretical activity.</v>

1697
01:37:14.441 --> 01:37:17.180
<v Speaker 5>You mean the Catholic church in middle </v>
<v Speaker 5>ages burned heretics.</v>

1698
01:37:17.181 --> 01:37:18.100
<v Speaker 5>So why was that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1699
01:37:18.101 --> 01:37:21.700
<v Speaker 5>because you couldn't say there was that </v>
<v Speaker 5>anytime and feeling you're going to give</v>

1700
01:37:21.701 --> 01:37:22.431
<v Speaker 5>them any,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll touch you.</v>

1701
01:37:22.431 --> 01:37:25.960
<v Speaker 5>There's like 250 religious visionaries </v>
<v Speaker 5>wandering around.</v>

1702
01:37:26.460 --> 01:37:27.293
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they followed them to establish a </v>

1703
01:37:27.971 --> 01:37:28.804
<v Speaker 5>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well instantly you have 250 countries </v>

1704
01:37:31.151 --> 01:37:33.520
<v Speaker 5>all fighting with one another.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Catholics,</v>

1705
01:37:33.521 --> 01:37:35.380
<v Speaker 5>they didn't know and we still don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>know.</v>

1706
01:37:35.381 --> 01:37:40.381
<v Speaker 5>How do you mediate between competing </v>
<v Speaker 5>moral claims knows suppressant.</v>

1707
01:37:41.650 --> 01:37:43.300
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause you need to order.</v>

1708
01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:44.673
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Darren was their attitude and it's </v>

1709
01:37:45.401 --> 01:37:48.010
<v Speaker 5>understandable and you saying well the </v>
<v Speaker 5>inquisition and so on.</v>

1710
01:37:48.011 --> 01:37:48.551
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1711
01:37:48.551 --> 01:37:49.840
<v Speaker 5>no kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a terrible thing.</v>

1712
01:37:51.130 --> 01:37:51.963
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying it's not a terrible thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>to bunch of order is a catastrophe and </v>

1713
01:37:55.801 --> 01:37:59.610
<v Speaker 5>so was too much chaos come too much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cannabis is generated by careless,</v>

1714
01:37:59.611 --> 01:38:00.444
<v Speaker 5>creative back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>careless activity that runs under the </v>

1715
01:38:03.631 --> 01:38:07.200
<v Speaker 5>guise of hero,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's why they miss safe.</v>

1716
01:38:07.201 --> 01:38:08.034
<v Speaker 5>You're going to be here and you master </v>
<v Speaker 5>the culture first before you and you're </v>

1717
01:38:10.561 --> 01:38:11.394
<v Speaker 5>buying it because otherwise he might do </v>
<v Speaker 5>something careless that you think is </v>

1718
01:38:13.891 --> 01:38:14.724
<v Speaker 5>creative that blows everything is like a</v>
<v Speaker 5>minor example is the modification of </v>

1719
01:38:18.481 --> 01:38:20.130
<v Speaker 5>that 30 day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So keeping them being,</v>

1720
01:38:20.131 --> 01:38:20.964
<v Speaker 5>telling them I'm fairy tale for God only</v>
<v Speaker 5>knows how long and someone comes along </v>

1721
01:38:23.611 --> 01:38:24.960
<v Speaker 5>and chops the ending off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1722
01:38:25.230 --> 01:38:26.430
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this isn't violent.</v>

1723
01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:29.880
<v Speaker 5>That isn't even at the point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's careless.</v>

1724
01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:33.450
<v Speaker 5>The SEC,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so not is definitely a danger.</v>

1725
01:38:33.451 --> 01:38:35.430
<v Speaker 5>When I said the Romans died,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it digest it.</v>

1726
01:38:35.460 --> 01:38:36.293
<v Speaker 5>That's not a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like they expanded like math </v>

1727
01:38:38.850 --> 01:38:41.550
<v Speaker 5>collected all these gods.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like their morality was,</v>

1728
01:38:41.930 --> 01:38:45.480
<v Speaker 5>was was decimated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't know how to,</v>

1729
01:38:45.481 --> 01:38:49.340
<v Speaker 5>I'm getting more so in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a neat unity.</v>

1730
01:38:49.530 --> 01:38:52.260
<v Speaker 5>That's the morning of European is full </v>
<v Speaker 5>been in cultures.</v>

1731
01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:54.180
<v Speaker 5>So that's why we're at war with </v>
<v Speaker 5>ourselves</v>

1732
01:38:59.470 --> 01:39:03.810
<v Speaker 4>historically and cultural constructions </v>
<v Speaker 4>of gender or</v>

1733
01:39:05.330 --> 01:39:07.350
<v Speaker 4>simultaneously like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1734
01:39:08.050 --> 01:39:12.330
<v Speaker 4>the mother or like the source of all </v>
<v Speaker 4>things and yet the unknown.</v>

1735
01:39:12.620 --> 01:39:15.810
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's interesting to look at the woman</v>

1736
01:39:15.811 --> 01:39:16.830
<v Speaker 4>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1737
01:39:17.250 --> 01:39:20.880
<v Speaker 4>how she sees herself rough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how she says your story because yes,</v>

1738
01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:22.940
<v Speaker 4>she had one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

1739
01:39:23.130 --> 01:39:25.260
<v Speaker 4>one or scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She is the source of all things.</v>

1740
01:39:25.630 --> 01:39:28.690
<v Speaker 4>And the other respect she has dean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you can look like culturally,</v>

1741
01:39:28.710 --> 01:39:30.360
<v Speaker 4>like when you talked about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>inquisition,</v>

1742
01:39:30.361 --> 01:39:32.190
<v Speaker 4>like at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the woman,</v>

1743
01:39:32.310 --> 01:39:34.900
<v Speaker 4>we're all being witches because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1744
01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:38.040
<v Speaker 4>basically they were trying to uphold the</v>
<v Speaker 4>tradition.</v>

1745
01:39:38.150 --> 01:39:39.510
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they were all good,</v>

1746
01:39:39.511 --> 01:39:39.901
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1747
01:39:39.901 --> 01:39:42.240
<v Speaker 4>doing these crazy rituals and they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>the threat.</v>

1748
01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:43.950
<v Speaker 4>They are the enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were the know.</v>

1749
01:39:44.610 --> 01:39:46.260
<v Speaker 4>Whereas like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1750
01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:50.580
<v Speaker 4>which is something we'll start rolling </v>
<v Speaker 4>through our history.</v>

1751
01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:52.730
<v Speaker 4>The woman is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which can cure danger,</v>

1752
01:39:52.731 --> 01:39:53.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1753
01:39:54.420 --> 01:39:55.490
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's the split.</v>

1754
01:39:56.180 --> 01:40:00.860
<v Speaker 5>The split of the archetype is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>archetype of the unknown is feminine and</v>

1755
01:40:00.861 --> 01:40:04.610
<v Speaker 5>Feminine Femininity has two positive and</v>
<v Speaker 5>negative and positive.</v>

1756
01:40:04.611 --> 01:40:05.444
<v Speaker 5>The medieval culture that was sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrapped up in symbolism around the </v>

1757
01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:09.673
<v Speaker 5>Virgin Mary and the other counselors </v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of more occupied this territory of </v>

1758
01:40:12.381 --> 01:40:16.410
<v Speaker 5>the witch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So is he going to do,</v>

1759
01:40:16.420 --> 01:40:17.253
<v Speaker 5>so I'm just reiterating your point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You that applies to fit females is very </v>

1760
01:40:22.461 --> 01:40:25.370
<v Speaker 5>complicated because you have all these </v>
<v Speaker 5>different aspects.</v>

1761
01:40:25.371 --> 01:40:26.204
<v Speaker 5>The embodiment of the unknown plus the </v>
<v Speaker 5>capacity for her rote behavior be more </v>

1762
01:40:30.531 --> 01:40:30.851
<v Speaker 5>than than,</v>
<v Speaker 5>than,</v>

1763
01:40:30.851 --> 01:40:34.160
<v Speaker 5>than creative and</v>
<v Speaker 5>exploratory behavior.</v>

1764
01:40:34.430 --> 01:40:37.050
<v Speaker 5>And those two things are hard to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are</v>

1765
01:40:37.050 --> 01:40:40.390
<v Speaker 4>two stories that are very different on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the woman tells her story,</v>

1766
01:40:40.580 --> 01:40:41.413
<v Speaker 4>the story that she's trying new things </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then she's a witch and she has to </v>

1767
01:40:45.340 --> 01:40:50.110
<v Speaker 4>integrate that because you have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand yourself or stories you,</v>

1768
01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:53.130
<v Speaker 4>when women were separated during that </v>
<v Speaker 4>stretch,</v>

1769
01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:55.353
<v Speaker 5>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had to incorporate that into who </v>

1770
01:40:57.671 --> 01:40:58.341
<v Speaker 5>they were.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1771
01:40:58.341 --> 01:40:59.174
<v Speaker 5>they were danger that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's two different stories and I </v>

1772
01:41:02.411 --> 01:41:04.750
<v Speaker 5>think that's ultimately left the store </v>
<v Speaker 5>of a problem,</v>

1773
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:07.180
<v Speaker 5>understanding who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the middle also,</v>

1774
01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:13.270
<v Speaker 5>all three,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all three pieces of the entire world,</v>

1775
01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:16.340
<v Speaker 5>both,</v>
<v Speaker 5>both you and kill you.</v>

1776
01:41:16.450 --> 01:41:17.440
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if that's true,</v>

1777
01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:19.040
<v Speaker 5>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>

1778
01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:24.600
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1779
01:41:30.670 --> 01:41:32.810
<v Speaker 5>I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how true that is.</v>

1780
01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:35.920
<v Speaker 5>I suspect that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I doubt that it's true because,</v>

1781
01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:37.630
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's an example.</v>

1782
01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:41.170
<v Speaker 5>If you want to predict the education </v>
<v Speaker 5>status of a child,</v>

1783
01:41:41.650 --> 01:41:44.050
<v Speaker 5>the best predictors,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mother's level of education,</v>

1784
01:41:44.250 --> 01:41:45.083
<v Speaker 5>farthest of the two parents,</v>
<v Speaker 5>father's level of education does not </v>

1785
01:41:48.371 --> 01:41:51.520
<v Speaker 5>correlate well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It correlates with the mother's level of</v>

1786
01:41:51.521 --> 01:41:54.220
<v Speaker 5>education.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's true,</v>

1787
01:41:54.221 --> 01:41:55.070
<v Speaker 5>but it does,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't,</v>

1788
01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:59.100
<v Speaker 5>is not anywhere near as good as good a </v>
<v Speaker 5>predictor for the child's development in</v>

1789
01:41:59.101 --> 01:41:59.934
<v Speaker 5>his mother's lap.</v>

1790
01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:00.833
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think it's reasonable to say that </v>

1791
01:42:02.261 --> 01:42:03.094
<v Speaker 5>in large part,</v>
<v Speaker 5>women are the primary socialization </v>

1792
01:42:04.931 --> 01:42:06.970
<v Speaker 5>agents.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At least they have been historically for</v>

1793
01:42:06.971 --> 01:42:10.690
<v Speaker 5>the first two years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>three years,</v>

1794
01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:13.810
<v Speaker 5>maybe even longer than that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I don't,</v>

1795
01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:14.673
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Plus I also don't think that women's </v>

1796
01:42:16.931 --> 01:42:19.360
<v Speaker 5>role in history has been nearly as </v>
<v Speaker 5>subordinate.</v>

1797
01:42:19.361 --> 01:42:21.880
<v Speaker 5>And as people generally claim,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it depends on your,</v>

1798
01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:24.730
<v Speaker 5>on your standard for defining </v>
<v Speaker 5>subordination.</v>

1799
01:42:24.750 --> 01:42:25.583
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there were that at every level of </v>

1800
01:42:28.091 --> 01:42:29.960
<v Speaker 5>analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>functionally quality range.</v>

1801
01:42:30.010 --> 01:42:33.470
<v Speaker 5>Cause that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I also think that women and men,</v>

1802
01:42:33.950 --> 01:42:37.810
<v Speaker 5>men doesn't impact on the course of </v>
<v Speaker 5>giving them,</v>

1803
01:42:37.811 --> 01:42:40.990
<v Speaker 5>develop</v>
<v Speaker 5>their contributions.</v>

1804
01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:45.633
<v Speaker 5>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't really think that we might have </v>

1805
01:42:46.961 --> 01:42:50.310
<v Speaker 5>been session male structure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You are just like that.</v>

1806
01:42:50.350 --> 01:42:51.580
<v Speaker 5>The fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

1807
01:42:51.581 --> 01:42:54.600
<v Speaker 5>their men are all the sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but nor is one example of that.</v>

1808
01:42:54.610 --> 01:42:56.650
<v Speaker 5>That tends to be overlooked in peaceful </v>
<v Speaker 5>times.</v>

1809
01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:02.170
<v Speaker 5>Well</v>
<v Speaker 5>sacrifice.</v>

1810
01:43:02.810 --> 01:43:07.570
<v Speaker 5>How</v>
<v Speaker 5>well fairly fair enough.</v>

1811
01:43:07.571 --> 01:43:08.404
<v Speaker 5>I mean there are problems in gender </v>
<v Speaker 5>relationships and an adaptation </v>

1812
01:43:11.441 --> 01:43:14.110
<v Speaker 5>everywhere in peaceful times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe men have the upper hand,</v>

1813
01:43:14.111 --> 01:43:17.170
<v Speaker 5>but more</v>
<v Speaker 5>the situation,</v>

1814
01:43:17.410 --> 01:43:22.410
<v Speaker 5>at least historically these movers</v>
<v Speaker 5>directly voted to take</v>

1815
01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:35.260
<v Speaker 5>it was through the perspective of mail,</v>
<v Speaker 5>written history,</v>

1816
01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:37.690
<v Speaker 5>tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and</v>

1817
01:43:40.620 --> 01:43:41.453
<v Speaker 5>sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>develop the idea of freedom because </v>

1818
01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:48.390
<v Speaker 5>they're the ones that had</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of freedom.</v>

1819
01:43:49.620 --> 01:43:51.580
<v Speaker 5>I think women have been powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1820
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:52.423
<v Speaker 5>so I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think they've been written into </v>

1821
01:43:54.051 --> 01:43:54.884
<v Speaker 5>history from the male perspective and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that could be us or women have had a </v>

1822
01:43:58.721 --> 01:44:00.720
<v Speaker 5>huge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their story has been written by now.</v>

1823
01:44:01.490 --> 01:44:03.320
<v Speaker 5>Stories are written by people who have </v>
<v Speaker 5>leisure.</v>

1824
01:44:04.490 --> 01:44:07.130
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Our primary child care,</v>

1825
01:44:08.810 --> 01:44:10.790
<v Speaker 5>especially if that also shortens your </v>
<v Speaker 5>lifespan.</v>

1826
01:44:11.660 --> 01:44:12.493
<v Speaker 5>Women's influence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe large and implicit in what the </v>

1827
01:44:15.201 --> 01:44:17.960
<v Speaker 5>stories and the items are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All exquisite needs.</v>

1828
01:44:17.970 --> 01:44:18.803
<v Speaker 5>You said that one of the reasons western</v>
<v Speaker 5>culture was so powerful was because his </v>

1829
01:44:21.561 --> 01:44:23.100
<v Speaker 5>philosophy was written by bachelors.</v>

1830
01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:28.970
<v Speaker 5>Good observation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>observation.</v>

1831
01:44:28.971 --> 01:44:33.971
<v Speaker 5>But it does take leisure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Leisure.</v>

1832
01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:46.240
<v Speaker 5>We started the course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1833
01:44:52.940 --> 01:44:53.773
<v Speaker 5>Well one of the things I was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do at the beginning of the class was to </v>

1834
01:44:55.580 --> 01:44:57.820
<v Speaker 5>out how an explicit story puts 4 </v>
<v Speaker 5>million,</v>

1835
01:44:57.821 --> 01:45:01.010
<v Speaker 5>can fund your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A whole sequence of implicit stories.</v>

1836
01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:05.020
<v Speaker 5>That's really the notion behind the </v>
<v Speaker 5>conflict between</v>

1837
01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:10.060
<v Speaker 5>miracle stories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really explicit.</v>

1838
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:14.450
<v Speaker 5>You can grasp</v>
<v Speaker 5>once you accepted.</v>

1839
01:45:17.130 --> 01:45:20.800
<v Speaker 5>I've been thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 5>why it is,</v>

1840
01:45:20.801 --> 01:45:21.634
<v Speaker 5>I'm a singer and I see a lot of a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 5>homosexuals in the art scene and stuff </v>

1841
01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:29.120
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was wondering why,</v>

1842
01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:31.640
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why is it that they tend to,</v>

1843
01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.100
<v Speaker 5>a lot of them tend to go into the arts </v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1844
01:45:34.450 --> 01:45:36.230
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and are very successful at it.</v>

1845
01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:40.650
<v Speaker 5>And I was thinking that maybe because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they are forced to a lot of times to um,</v>

1846
01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:44.720
<v Speaker 5>to partake in a group that they aren't </v>
<v Speaker 5>necessarily a part of our,</v>

1847
01:45:44.721 --> 01:45:47.810
<v Speaker 5>at least for us in that heterosexuality </v>
<v Speaker 5>is adolescence.</v>

1848
01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:48.913
<v Speaker 5>And then have to have to fight out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>that had to have a really huge internal </v>

1849
01:45:52.340 --> 01:45:53.840
<v Speaker 5>struggle if they ever do make it out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1850
01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:54.953
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then at that point they are able to </v>

1851
01:45:56.151 --> 01:45:56.984
<v Speaker 5>add,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're able to add more to the group </v>

1852
01:45:59.510 --> 01:46:03.080
<v Speaker 5>through things like our creative </v>
<v Speaker 5>processes,</v>

1853
01:46:03.390 --> 01:46:04.223
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>builds up creative ability or that they </v>

1854
01:46:08.180 --> 01:46:11.480
<v Speaker 5>advanced at an earlier age because they </v>
<v Speaker 5>have this,</v>

1855
01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:12.420
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the saying that they want,</v>

1856
01:46:12.530 --> 01:46:13.363
<v Speaker 5>and this is by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this enormous anomalous information I </v>

1857
01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:19.193
<v Speaker 5>thought about sometimes in terms of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>necessity for people who are homosexual </v>

1858
01:46:22.941 --> 01:46:23.774
<v Speaker 5>to integrate different gender roles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I thought they could serve the </v>

1859
01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:32.330
<v Speaker 5>people in that position because the fact</v>
<v Speaker 5>that homosexuality is very peculiar from</v>

1860
01:46:32.331 --> 01:46:33.164
<v Speaker 5>an evolutionary point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's hard to account for its existence </v>

1861
01:46:35.241 --> 01:46:38.240
<v Speaker 5>from the blue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I thought,</v>

1862
01:46:38.241 --> 01:46:39.074
<v Speaker 5>well maybe we need to do a particular </v>
<v Speaker 5>cultural intermediary between the sexes </v>

1863
01:46:42.471 --> 01:46:43.304
<v Speaker 5>possibility or,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or in between the mental logic in the </v>

1864
01:46:44.991 --> 01:46:46.340
<v Speaker 5>meetings with the masculine and </v>
<v Speaker 5>feminine,</v>

1865
01:46:46.850 --> 01:46:49.620
<v Speaker 5>you have another hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1866
01:46:49.621 --> 01:46:53.100
<v Speaker 5>sometimes one of the best niches if </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't kill you,</v>

1867
01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:56.920
<v Speaker 5>makes you stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes best trade you can have really</v>

1868
01:46:56.990 --> 01:46:59.910
<v Speaker 5>cool because if you overcome it well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you've got something.</v>

1869
01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:02.160
<v Speaker 5>Although you might die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just</v>

1870
01:47:04.020 --> 01:47:04.853
<v Speaker 5>the downside.</v>

1871
01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:08.940
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so next week we talked about,</v>

1872
01:47:09.150 --> 01:47:09.983
<v Speaker 5>no two weeks.</v>
