1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.673
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.713
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk to you a little bit about</v>
<v Speaker 2>theories of truth and there's a reason </v>

3
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:12.343
<v Speaker 2>for that and the reason is that I want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make a distinction between two kinds </v>

4
00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:17.714
<v Speaker 2>of knowledge and before I do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk about the multiple ways </v>

5
00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:23.504
<v Speaker 2>that you can determine whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>something is true and for whether </v>

6
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.053
<v Speaker 2>something is factual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's much more difficult task than you </v>

7
00:00:30.711 --> 00:00:31.544
<v Speaker 2>might think because it's easy to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's only one way of defining </v>

8
00:00:34.431 --> 00:00:35.264
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not the case as far as I can </v>

9
00:00:39.051 --> 00:00:39.884
<v Speaker 2>tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing I'm going to do is </v>

10
00:00:43.071 --> 00:00:48.071
<v Speaker 2>talk to you about how things might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>true from a Darwinian perspective.</v>

11
00:00:48.651 --> 00:00:51.230
<v Speaker 2>And if you think you can knock any holes</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this argument,</v>

12
00:00:51.231 --> 00:00:52.064
<v Speaker 2>go right ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I'd been hacking away at it for </v>

13
00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:57.380
<v Speaker 2>awhile and I haven't been able to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

14
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.700
<v Speaker 2>Darwin had had this theory back in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>late 18 hundreds,</v>

15
00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:03.290
<v Speaker 2>which you're nobody I would all aware </v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

16
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.660
<v Speaker 2>And it was basically predicated on two </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental axioms.</v>

17
00:01:08.661 --> 00:01:09.494
<v Speaker 2>And the first axiom was that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural variability in a population and </v>

18
00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:16.274
<v Speaker 2>that was later discovered to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with genetic variability and </v>

19
00:01:20.241 --> 00:01:22.640
<v Speaker 2>that that genetic variability could </v>
<v Speaker 2>transform.</v>

20
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.570
<v Speaker 2>That's mutations do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was in some sense,</v>

21
00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:27.404
<v Speaker 2>a later addition to Darwin's theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the natural environment select </v>

22
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.820
<v Speaker 2>the most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the organism that's most suitable to the</v>

23
00:01:42.021 --> 00:01:42.854
<v Speaker 2>current environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all things considered so that it can </v>

24
00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:46.634
<v Speaker 2>propagate right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then whatever propagates moves to </v>

25
00:01:50.931 --> 00:01:53.540
<v Speaker 2>the next generation and the same process</v>
<v Speaker 2>occurs again.</v>

26
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.913
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there's a variety of complications </v>

27
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.110
<v Speaker 2>about that theory that I'm going to lay </v>
<v Speaker 2>out a little bit.</v>

28
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.493
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the victorians first got ahold of </v>

29
00:02:04.611 --> 00:02:05.444
<v Speaker 2>this theory that kind of thought that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>meant that there was a natural </v>

30
00:02:07.581 --> 00:02:08.510
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

31
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.373
<v Speaker 2>That as evolution progressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it progressed and that higher organisms </v>

32
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.450
<v Speaker 2>followed in the trail of lower </v>
<v Speaker 2>organisms.</v>

33
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.283
<v Speaker 2>And so in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it wasn't a natural or </v>

34
00:02:22.311 --> 00:02:27.311
<v Speaker 2>necessary presumption for those who </v>
<v Speaker 2>adopted Darwinian theory,</v>

35
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.603
<v Speaker 2>the idea of a hierarchy of value in some</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense was still part of Darwinian </v>

36
00:02:33.201 --> 00:02:34.730
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we could say,</v>

37
00:02:34.731 --> 00:02:35.990
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings are,</v>

38
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution has led to over.</v>

39
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.983
<v Speaker 2>It's billions of years to us and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>far more complicated than simple </v>

40
00:02:42.591 --> 00:02:43.424
<v Speaker 2>creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it seems like there's a process at </v>

41
00:02:45.651 --> 00:02:49.160
<v Speaker 2>least of increasing complexification </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on and maybe that has something to</v>

42
00:02:49.161 --> 00:02:52.940
<v Speaker 2>do with increased value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're more fit now.</v>

43
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.550
<v Speaker 2>Modern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark,</v>

44
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:55.783
<v Speaker 2>modern evolutionary biologists take </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue with this because they don't </v>

45
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.800
<v Speaker 2>really think that there is any </v>
<v Speaker 2>directionality in evolution.</v>

46
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:03.634
<v Speaker 2>And after all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are still plenty of one celled </v>

47
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:07.210
<v Speaker 2>organisms around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fact,</v>

48
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:08.044
<v Speaker 2>there are more one celled organisms in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body than there are your own cells </v>

49
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:13.810
<v Speaker 2>by a huge margin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

50
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.100
<v Speaker 2>so the idea that there's a necessary </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction in evolution,</v>

51
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.083
<v Speaker 2>rain going from simple to more complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>is not formally true except that </v>

52
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.693
<v Speaker 2>obviously there are much more complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>organisms then there were around a </v>

53
00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:28.444
<v Speaker 2>couple of billion years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there does seem to be some </v>

54
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:32.130
<v Speaker 2>directionality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

55
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.560
<v Speaker 2>in some cases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not exactly obvious why that is</v>

56
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.083
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the reason I'm telling you that is </v>

57
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Speaker 2>because it's not self evident that</v>

58
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.810
<v Speaker 2>creatures as they evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>become more fit,</v>

59
00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:51.560
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what evolutionary themed seems to</v>

60
00:03:51.561 --> 00:03:52.394
<v Speaker 2>be about evolutionary theory seems to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>about at a deeper level is something </v>

61
00:03:55.521 --> 00:03:58.310
<v Speaker 2>like a dance between the environment and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the organism.</v>

62
00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:59.503
<v Speaker 2>So the Oregon in the environment keeps </v>
<v Speaker 2>transforming and it does that </v>

63
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.780
<v Speaker 2>unpredictably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say randomly,</v>

64
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.560
<v Speaker 2>but it does it unpredictably or </v>
<v Speaker 2>unpredictable,</v>

65
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:10.483
<v Speaker 2>unpredictable built,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it unpredictably to an </v>

66
00:04:13.221 --> 00:04:18.221
<v Speaker 2>unpredictable degree because some things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are true today are going to be true</v>

67
00:04:18.621 --> 00:04:19.454
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but other things aren't and you don't </v>

68
00:04:20.451 --> 00:04:23.060
<v Speaker 2>know which ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which one of those are going to shift.</v>

69
00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.493
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you want to get a practical </v>

70
00:04:26.721 --> 00:04:29.480
<v Speaker 2>idea of how the environment moves </v>
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>

71
00:04:29.481 --> 00:04:30.314
<v Speaker 2>one of the best ways to do that is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to predict the stock market because </v>

72
00:04:33.441 --> 00:04:36.890
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty easy to predict the stock </v>
<v Speaker 2>market based on past performance.</v>

73
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.993
<v Speaker 2>But it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to predict the stock </v>

74
00:04:39.711 --> 00:04:40.544
<v Speaker 2>market by deriving formulas that </v>
<v Speaker 2>predicted past performance to predict </v>

75
00:04:44.871 --> 00:04:45.650
<v Speaker 2>the future.</v>

76
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.960
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no evidence that you can do it.</v>

77
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.660
<v Speaker 2>And so most money managers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

78
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.540
<v Speaker 2>do worse than chance at picking stocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and so,</v>

79
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.833
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've thought for a long time about why </v>

80
00:04:59.061 --> 00:05:03.080
<v Speaker 2>anybody would ever invest their money </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a money manager in the stock market</v>

81
00:05:03.081 --> 00:05:03.914
<v Speaker 2>and the best answer I've come up with is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people don't want to take </v>

82
00:05:07.131 --> 00:05:07.964
<v Speaker 2>responsibility for making mistakes with </v>
<v Speaker 2>their money and so they have a lot of </v>

83
00:05:11.391 --> 00:05:14.300
<v Speaker 2>money and it makes them nervous and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't,</v>

84
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.670
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know anything about investing</v>

85
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.710
<v Speaker 2>and maybe you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyways,</v>

86
00:05:18.711 --> 00:05:20.210
<v Speaker 2>they don't know anything about investing</v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

87
00:05:20.211 --> 00:05:23.570
<v Speaker 2>So they parsed the money off to a money </v>
<v Speaker 2>manager who's an expert.</v>

88
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.090
<v Speaker 2>And then if they lose their money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can say to themselves,</v>

89
00:05:26.091 --> 00:05:28.400
<v Speaker 2>well at least I had an expert looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>after it.</v>

90
00:05:28.401 --> 00:05:31.220
<v Speaker 2>But if you look into it deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find that there's</v>

91
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.923
<v Speaker 2>the bulk of preponderance of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence suggests that you cannot get </v>

92
00:05:38.311 --> 00:05:39.144
<v Speaker 2>enough information to accurately predict</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the stock market is going to do at </v>

93
00:05:41.601 --> 00:05:42.434
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can kind of see that that's </v>

94
00:05:43.411 --> 00:05:44.244
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you could get a consistent </v>

95
00:05:45.091 --> 00:05:48.390
<v Speaker 2>edge of say one 10th of one percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which sounds like nothing.</v>

96
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:49.031
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did.</v>

97
00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:49.864
<v Speaker 2>They I'll have to do is repeat your bets</v>
<v Speaker 2>over and over and soon you'd have all </v>

98
00:05:52.411 --> 00:05:54.510
<v Speaker 2>the money in the world because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>compounding,</v>

99
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.793
<v Speaker 2>so and the stock market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good model of the environment because </v>

100
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:00.920
<v Speaker 2>it is in fact a model of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

101
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:03.350
<v Speaker 2>It's not a model of the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment obviously,</v>

102
00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:06.200
<v Speaker 2>but all sorts of things affect stock </v>
<v Speaker 2>market prices,</v>

103
00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:07.034
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Psychological factors and biological </v>

104
00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:11.660
<v Speaker 2>factors in whether and political events </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so forth.</v>

105
00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 2>So as far as models of the environment </v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

106
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.580
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty good one and you can't stay.</v>

107
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.200
<v Speaker 2>You can't keep up with it fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

108
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.810
<v Speaker 2>So you can think of the environment that</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

109
00:06:20.811 --> 00:06:21.644
<v Speaker 2>It's this thing that's dancing around </v>
<v Speaker 2>and some elements of it are more stable </v>

110
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:26.360
<v Speaker 2>than than others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

111
00:06:26.361 --> 00:06:29.020
<v Speaker 2>the sun appears to be pretty stable at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least on our timeframe.</v>

112
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.903
<v Speaker 2>So that's a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but lots of things can't be relied on </v>

113
00:06:32.121 --> 00:06:35.300
<v Speaker 2>from one moment to another and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know what direction it's going to turn.</v>

114
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:36.733
<v Speaker 2>So the way that life deals with that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>by producing a plethora of variance and </v>

115
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:43.790
<v Speaker 2>basically letting anything that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>work die.</v>

116
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.520
<v Speaker 2>So evolution requires an awful lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>death,</v>

117
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:47.623
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's ideas that what we've done </v>

118
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:50.444
<v Speaker 2>to some degree is we've internalized the</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary process because we can </v>

119
00:06:53.811 --> 00:06:56.480
<v Speaker 2>invent fictional representatives of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves,</v>

120
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.733
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which would be our potential future </v>

121
00:06:58.821 --> 00:06:59.654
<v Speaker 2>selves and we could run simulations of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the environment and kill off all those </v>

122
00:07:03.411 --> 00:07:06.590
<v Speaker 2>potential future selves that don't look </v>
<v Speaker 2>like they would actually survive.</v>

123
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.200
<v Speaker 2>And that's really what we think about as</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>

124
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.870
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all right,</v>

125
00:07:11.871 --> 00:07:14.930
<v Speaker 2>so then the next thing you might ask </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself about,</v>

126
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.670
<v Speaker 2>given that is we're going to shift basis</v>
<v Speaker 2>here a little bit,</v>

127
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:20.773
<v Speaker 2>is what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would you define reality if you had </v>

128
00:07:23.781 --> 00:07:26.540
<v Speaker 2>to come up with a definition of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>constituted real,</v>

129
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:27.763
<v Speaker 2>how would you go about doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say the way the West does </v>

130
00:07:30.531 --> 00:07:31.070
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

131
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.260
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a schizophrenia element to it,</v>

132
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.393
<v Speaker 2>a split element.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was an incoherence in it and I </v>

133
00:07:37.641 --> 00:07:39.320
<v Speaker 2>haven't heard anyone else make this </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>

134
00:07:39.321 --> 00:07:40.154
<v Speaker 2>So if you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can figure out some reason why </v>

135
00:07:41.181 --> 00:07:42.380
<v Speaker 2>it's stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then let me know.</v>

136
00:07:42.381 --> 00:07:43.214
<v Speaker 2>But so think about it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like our basic presumptions about the </v>

137
00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:47.174
<v Speaker 2>world are materialistic right now and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would say that those materialistic </v>

138
00:07:50.901 --> 00:07:54.860
<v Speaker 2>assumptions were basically laid down at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the beginning of the scientific endeavor</v>

139
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:55.693
<v Speaker 2>and so that would be about the time of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bacon and descartes and so because they </v>

140
00:07:59.421 --> 00:08:02.210
<v Speaker 2>sort of laid the foundations for modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>science and there's some,</v>

141
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.073
<v Speaker 2>there's some rules about what things are</v>
<v Speaker 2>in reality and the rules or something </v>

142
00:08:06.711 --> 00:08:07.640
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

143
00:08:07.641 --> 00:08:08.474
<v Speaker 2>things are made out of littler things </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then if you go all the way down to </v>

144
00:08:11.031 --> 00:08:14.180
<v Speaker 2>the level where the littlest thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible is,</v>

145
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:15.283
<v Speaker 2>well that's where you find the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental constituent elements of </v>

146
00:08:17.751 --> 00:08:18.584
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>

147
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.270
<v Speaker 2>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

148
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.193
<v Speaker 2>it's an matter is detectable by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>senses and it's Inter subjectively </v>

149
00:08:25.221 --> 00:08:26.480
<v Speaker 2>detectable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can,</v>

150
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:27.583
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can detect something with your </v>

151
00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:31.610
<v Speaker 2>senses fundamentally or with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>extension of your senses.</v>

152
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.330
<v Speaker 2>You can describe how you went about </v>
<v Speaker 2>detecting it.</v>

153
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:36.403
<v Speaker 2>Other people can duplicate that and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can report what they detect and if </v>

154
00:08:39.021 --> 00:08:43.010
<v Speaker 2>the reports are similar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we assume that that thing is real.</v>

155
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.040
<v Speaker 2>So in some sense it's what our senses </v>
<v Speaker 2>already do,</v>

156
00:08:46.041 --> 00:08:46.874
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because our census triangulate in a </v>

157
00:08:47.991 --> 00:08:48.824
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do you figure out if something's </v>

158
00:08:50.721 --> 00:08:52.490
<v Speaker 2>real well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can see it,</v>

159
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.863
<v Speaker 2>you know that's pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's better if you can see it and </v>

160
00:08:56.791 --> 00:08:57.624
<v Speaker 2>hear it and it's better yet if you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>see it and hear it and touch it and </v>

161
00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:01.404
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's better if you could see it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and hear it and touch it and taste it </v>

162
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.793
<v Speaker 2>and so forth.</v>

163
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.260
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've evolved these sensory systems that</v>

164
00:09:07.261 --> 00:09:08.094
<v Speaker 2>are quite different from a qualitative </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective and if they all report the </v>

165
00:09:11.761 --> 00:09:12.594
<v Speaker 2>same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we believe we have a pretty </v>

166
00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:17.010
<v Speaker 2>reasonable chance of actually believing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that thing is there.</v>

167
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:18.083
<v Speaker 2>And then with science we've actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>extended that capacity because we don't </v>

168
00:09:20.581 --> 00:09:21.414
<v Speaker 2>just use the senses of one person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We use our senses in a rigorous and </v>

169
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:25.644
<v Speaker 2>collective manner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that reports to us the nature of </v>

170
00:09:28.171 --> 00:09:30.150
<v Speaker 2>what we've come to call the objective </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

171
00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:30.961
<v Speaker 2>And then we say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

172
00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:33.780
<v Speaker 2>accurate descriptions of the objective </v>
<v Speaker 2>world are true.</v>

173
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

174
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.940
<v Speaker 2>that's a good theory and you can also </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly see.</v>

175
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.570
<v Speaker 2>You can certainly see it's objective </v>
<v Speaker 2>utility.</v>

176
00:09:42.571 --> 00:09:43.560
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say that.</v>

177
00:09:43.561 --> 00:09:47.310
<v Speaker 2>It's pragmatic utility because when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>play by the rules of science,</v>

178
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.340
<v Speaker 2>it appears that your power expands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

179
00:09:50.341 --> 00:09:52.140
<v Speaker 2>So that's another reason why we think </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>

180
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:53.003
<v Speaker 2>You run through these routines and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden you could do things you </v>

181
00:09:55.351 --> 00:09:58.950
<v Speaker 2>couldn't do before and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a different criteria of truth,</v>

182
00:09:58.951 --> 00:09:59.784
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's more like a criteria of </v>

183
00:10:00.361 --> 00:10:04.320
<v Speaker 2>usefulness and a practical usefulness </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you would think to that,</v>

184
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:08.710
<v Speaker 2>and this is why you thought that science</v>
<v Speaker 2>was actually embedded inside a narrative</v>

185
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.590
<v Speaker 2>in a deeper narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

186
00:10:10.591 --> 00:10:11.424
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't be doing science if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't think it was useful for </v>

187
00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:14.640
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

188
00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:16.950
<v Speaker 2>And then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well useful for what?</v>

189
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:18.450
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

190
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:19.343
<v Speaker 2>what would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you suffer less because of </v>

191
00:10:21.361 --> 00:10:24.240
<v Speaker 2>science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe live longer because of science.</v>

192
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.103
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you find life more interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could do a more diverse range of </v>

193
00:10:27.931 --> 00:10:28.764
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever we have made the decision that </v>

194
00:10:31.741 --> 00:10:33.990
<v Speaker 2>the utility of science justifies the </v>
<v Speaker 2>endeavor,</v>

195
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.880
<v Speaker 2>but that's a different criteria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

196
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:40.380
<v Speaker 2>That you utility of something and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could debate the utility of science from</v>

197
00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:42.900
<v Speaker 2>a Darwinian perspective because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could easily say,</v>

198
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.220
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's an example.</v>

199
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:45.923
<v Speaker 2>There was a book written awhile ago by </v>
<v Speaker 2>an ex KGB officer and he was talking </v>

200
00:10:49.831 --> 00:10:54.831
<v Speaker 2>about biological warfare labs in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Soviet Union and he claimed to have work</v>

201
00:10:55.111 --> 00:10:59.730
<v Speaker 2>in a biological warfare lab where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>goal was to cross Ebola was smallpox.</v>

202
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.550
<v Speaker 2>Now Ebola,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you all know about,</v>

203
00:11:02.551 --> 00:11:03.384
<v Speaker 2>isn't very contagious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to really be in contact with </v>

204
00:11:05.401 --> 00:11:09.090
<v Speaker 2>someone who has ebola to catch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But smallpox,</v>

205
00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.193
<v Speaker 2>that's contagious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you get the two things working </v>

206
00:11:12.601 --> 00:11:13.434
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have a disease that's </v>

207
00:11:14.041 --> 00:11:17.730
<v Speaker 2>basically 100 percent fatal and it would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

208
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:20.070
<v Speaker 2>you could distribute it in aerosol </v>
<v Speaker 2>forum,</v>

209
00:11:20.071 --> 00:11:23.130
<v Speaker 2>which is sort of the dream of any </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological weapons maker now.</v>

210
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.170
<v Speaker 2>They never really managed it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

211
00:11:25.171 --> 00:11:27.120
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of an interesting idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

212
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.253
<v Speaker 2>And it had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turned out and there were no people </v>

213
00:11:29.851 --> 00:11:30.684
<v Speaker 2>left and we'd have to say that our </v>
<v Speaker 2>notion about the utility of science </v>

214
00:11:33.601 --> 00:11:37.410
<v Speaker 2>turned out to be colossally wrong from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Darwinian perspective.</v>

215
00:11:37.411 --> 00:11:38.244
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might say the same thing about </v>

216
00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:41.670
<v Speaker 2>hydrogen bonds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

217
00:11:41.671 --> 00:11:44.130
<v Speaker 2>or maybe you might say the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>about computers because,</v>

218
00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:47.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me quite unlikely that human</v>

219
00:11:47.221 --> 00:11:50.610
<v Speaker 2>beings in their present form are going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be around 200 years in the future,</v>

220
00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:51.883
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the rate of the growth of computer </v>

221
00:11:53.711 --> 00:11:54.544
<v Speaker 2>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the probability that will become </v>

222
00:11:55.901 --> 00:11:56.734
<v Speaker 2>something biological and mechanical </v>
<v Speaker 2>together seems to me to be virtually </v>

223
00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:02.860
<v Speaker 2>certain we're certainly headed in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>

224
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:06.250
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question</v>

225
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:11.733
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>

226
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:15.940
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

227
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:16.960
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>

228
00:12:16.961 --> 00:12:18.250
<v Speaker 2>The question was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you ever think,</v>

229
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:19.143
<v Speaker 2>do you think that people's interest in </v>
<v Speaker 2>science can not be not pragmatically </v>

230
00:12:21.581 --> 00:12:22.414
<v Speaker 2>oriented?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually don't think so because I </v>

231
00:12:23.561 --> 00:12:24.394
<v Speaker 2>don't think that you would be interested</v>
<v Speaker 2>in science if it wasn't pragmatically </v>

232
00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:29.560
<v Speaker 2>useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>

233
00:12:29.561 --> 00:12:30.394
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly the point that I want to </v>

234
00:12:31.481 --> 00:12:32.314
<v Speaker 2>pursue in this lecture today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we are interested in things </v>

235
00:12:35.501 --> 00:12:38.320
<v Speaker 2>generally as a consequence of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceived utility,</v>

236
00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:40.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now the ends,</v>

237
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:44.980
<v Speaker 2>the framework within which you </v>
<v Speaker 2>determined utility is quite malleable.</v>

238
00:12:44.981 --> 00:12:47.110
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're suicidal,</v>

239
00:12:47.111 --> 00:12:51.790
<v Speaker 2>you might regard it how sharp knife is </v>
<v Speaker 2>as the primary object of interest,</v>

240
00:12:51.791 --> 00:12:53.710
<v Speaker 2>but generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

241
00:12:53.711 --> 00:12:58.300
<v Speaker 2>we would assume that especially if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a Darwinian thinker,</v>

242
00:12:58.301 --> 00:12:59.134
<v Speaker 2>that your primary interests or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like survival and reproduction and you </v>

243
00:13:02.501 --> 00:13:03.334
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's an unreasonable </v>

244
00:13:03.971 --> 00:13:04.800
<v Speaker 2>assumption.</v>

245
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm the terms are quite elastic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can throw a lot of motivations in</v>

246
00:13:08.981 --> 00:13:10.120
<v Speaker 2>them without,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

247
00:13:10.121 --> 00:13:12.190
<v Speaker 2>without having to think that rigorously </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

248
00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:14.650
<v Speaker 2>But as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a heuristic framework,</v>

249
00:13:14.651 --> 00:13:16.360
<v Speaker 2>it's not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

250
00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:17.403
<v Speaker 2>and so part of the reason that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that science was embedded in a </v>

251
00:13:19.871 --> 00:13:21.820
<v Speaker 2>dream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was the l chemical dream,</v>

252
00:13:21.821 --> 00:13:22.654
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally it was because he believed</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the people who developed the </v>

253
00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:30.280
<v Speaker 2>symbolic precursors to science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so those would be the alchemists.</v>

254
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.690
<v Speaker 2>Newton wasn't outcome by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

255
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.460
<v Speaker 2>we're looking for something </v>
<v Speaker 2>approximating the philosopher's stone,</v>

256
00:13:36.461 --> 00:13:39.460
<v Speaker 2>which was a material object which would </v>
<v Speaker 2>grant it's bearers,</v>

257
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:43.690
<v Speaker 2>eternal life and good health and wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the,</v>

258
00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:44.613
<v Speaker 2>the all chemists were the first people </v>
<v Speaker 2>in some sense to posit that if you </v>

259
00:13:47.651 --> 00:13:51.520
<v Speaker 2>systematically investigated the </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformations of the material world,</v>

260
00:13:51.521 --> 00:13:54.670
<v Speaker 2>which was regarded more or less as </v>
<v Speaker 2>damned by the Catholic Church,</v>

261
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:55.803
<v Speaker 2>that you could extract out information </v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be of substantial benefit to </v>

262
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.180
<v Speaker 2>the things I just described,</v>
<v Speaker 2>health,</v>

263
00:14:01.181 --> 00:14:02.290
<v Speaker 2>wealth and longevity.</v>

264
00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:05.470
<v Speaker 2>And so you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why are we pursuing science?</v>

265
00:14:05.471 --> 00:14:09.010
<v Speaker 2>Like why are we motivated to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you spend 10,000</v>

266
00:14:09.011 --> 00:14:11.920
<v Speaker 2>hours looking through a microscope?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very weird thing to do.</v>

267
00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:14.120
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the union ideas,</v>

268
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.540
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go right down to the base of the,</v>

269
00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:19.450
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the hierarchy of motivation,</v>

270
00:14:19.451 --> 00:14:20.284
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it to make the world a </v>
<v Speaker 2>better place in some manner that's </v>

271
00:14:23.201 --> 00:14:25.750
<v Speaker 2>important to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't.</v>

272
00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:26.733
<v Speaker 2>Science has to be nested inside a </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivational structure or no one would </v>

273
00:14:29.771 --> 00:14:31.390
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you know,</v>

274
00:14:31.391 --> 00:14:32.920
<v Speaker 2>you can think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you want,</v>

275
00:14:32.921 --> 00:14:33.754
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not an argument that you can </v>

276
00:14:35.201 --> 00:14:39.190
<v Speaker 2>easily dismissed because you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>account for why people are interested in</v>

277
00:14:39.191 --> 00:14:39.941
<v Speaker 2>science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

278
00:14:39.941 --> 00:14:40.691
<v Speaker 2>And if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

279
00:14:40.691 --> 00:14:41.890
<v Speaker 2>it's because they want to build a </v>
<v Speaker 2>career,</v>

280
00:14:41.891 --> 00:14:44.920
<v Speaker 2>that's fine because it just nests inside</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same argument anyways.</v>

281
00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:46.840
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now.</v>

282
00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:52.220
<v Speaker 2>So we kinda have a definition of reality</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a materialist perspective.</v>

283
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.140
<v Speaker 2>Now there's a few problems with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

284
00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:55.213
<v Speaker 2>One of the problems is is that when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get down to the fundamental elements of </v>

285
00:14:58.161 --> 00:14:58.994
<v Speaker 2>matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they turn out not to be very much like </v>

286
00:15:00.861 --> 00:15:01.694
<v Speaker 2>matter at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They turn out to be these weird quantum </v>

287
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:06.463
<v Speaker 2>processes and entities that appear to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>tangled up with consciousness in some </v>

288
00:15:10.041 --> 00:15:10.874
<v Speaker 2>way that no one can understand and </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly display all sorts of </v>

289
00:15:12.981 --> 00:15:16.280
<v Speaker 2>properties that aren't evident at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>macro level.</v>

290
00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.520
<v Speaker 2>So you know the formal job of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reductionism,</v>

291
00:15:19.521 --> 00:15:20.354
<v Speaker 2>which is you are one element of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reductionism because there's many </v>

292
00:15:23.721 --> 00:15:24.554
<v Speaker 2>elements of reductionism is that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>explain the complex by the simple and </v>

293
00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:28.903
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a lone time as we went deeper into </v>

294
00:15:30.801 --> 00:15:31.634
<v Speaker 2>the microstructure of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it did appear in some sense to be </v>

295
00:15:33.831 --> 00:15:34.580
<v Speaker 2>getting simpler.</v>

296
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.860
<v Speaker 2>But then when we went down to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>quantum level,</v>

297
00:15:36.861 --> 00:15:37.694
<v Speaker 2>it all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God incredibly weird and no one really </v>

298
00:15:39.051 --> 00:15:40.460
<v Speaker 2>knows what to do about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

299
00:15:40.461 --> 00:15:43.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna introduce quantum thinking</v>

300
00:15:43.761 --> 00:15:44.594
<v Speaker 2>into this discussion because you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>every Weirdo with a crockpot theory </v>

301
00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:51.170
<v Speaker 2>immediately immediately does that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very dangerous thing to do.</v>

302
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:52.423
<v Speaker 2>I'm just pointing out that we didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>expect for the nature of reality to </v>

303
00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:00.010
<v Speaker 2>qualitatively transform as we </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigated the microstructure.</v>

304
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.140
<v Speaker 2>But that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all of that aside,</v>

305
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:04.663
<v Speaker 2>the idea that truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there are facts about material </v>

306
00:16:07.611 --> 00:16:10.250
<v Speaker 2>reality and that those facts are true is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very,</v>

307
00:16:10.251 --> 00:16:12.860
<v Speaker 2>very powerful idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

308
00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.113
<v Speaker 2>we don't pursue it because the rationale</v>
<v Speaker 2>for pursuing that truth is based on </v>

309
00:16:20.781 --> 00:16:25.781
<v Speaker 2>truths that are different from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>truths that the process itself reveals.</v>

310
00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:28.800
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think you know,</v>

311
00:16:28.801 --> 00:16:30.200
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might well agree,</v>

312
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:31.303
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that perhaps investigating how to </v>

313
00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:34.784
<v Speaker 2>combine ebola with smallpox is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>really a good idea from a sign perfect </v>

314
00:16:39.831 --> 00:16:41.750
<v Speaker 2>idea from a scientific perspective.</v>

315
00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:46.370
<v Speaker 2>But there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems not unreasonable to assume that</v>

316
00:16:46.371 --> 00:16:51.371
<v Speaker 2>there's a broader perspective from which</v>
<v Speaker 2>that idea probably isn't for the best,</v>

317
00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now a pure scientists,</v>

318
00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.210
<v Speaker 2>there isn't such a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if there was,</v>

319
00:16:56.211 --> 00:17:00.260
<v Speaker 2>might say it doesn't matter because all </v>
<v Speaker 2>facts are equal because facts don't have</v>

320
00:17:00.261 --> 00:17:01.190
<v Speaker 2>value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

321
00:17:01.191 --> 00:17:02.480
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not valence,</v>

322
00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:03.373
<v Speaker 2>so all facts are equal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But of course you can't live like all </v>

323
00:17:05.631 --> 00:17:06.464
<v Speaker 2>facts are equal because there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>trillion facts and if you don't have </v>

324
00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:14.111
<v Speaker 2>some mechanism to zero you in on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>subset of relevant facts,</v>

325
00:17:14.391 --> 00:17:16.190
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're immobilized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

326
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.233
<v Speaker 2>you're just flooded by inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think something like that probably </v>

327
00:17:19.491 --> 00:17:22.130
<v Speaker 2>happens to people in the initial stages </v>
<v Speaker 2>of schizophrenia,</v>

328
00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.370
<v Speaker 2>so they can't distinguish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything becomes relevant.</v>

329
00:17:25.371 --> 00:17:27.220
<v Speaker 2>That's a bad situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

330
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:28.010
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

331
00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:28.843
<v Speaker 2>you're stuck with a subset of facts </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways and there are reasons that you </v>

332
00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:35.900
<v Speaker 2>choose the subset of facts that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>choose and those reasons aren't grounded</v>

333
00:17:35.901 --> 00:17:38.270
<v Speaker 2>in a materialist philosophy and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't be,</v>

334
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:39.950
<v Speaker 2>at least not in any simple way.</v>

335
00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.500
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe,</v>

336
00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:44.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully that's a coherent argument.</v>

337
00:17:44.721 --> 00:17:45.554
<v Speaker 2>Now the next part of it is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>something interesting that happened in </v>

338
00:17:48.561 --> 00:17:51.870
<v Speaker 2>the late 18 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in the late 18 hundreds,</v>

339
00:17:51.871 --> 00:17:55.500
<v Speaker 2>there were a group of philosophers on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the east coast of the United States,</v>

340
00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:56.623
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that called themselves pragmatists and </v>

341
00:17:57.631 --> 00:18:00.900
<v Speaker 2>William James was one of those people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and William James is of course,</v>

342
00:18:00.901 --> 00:18:03.300
<v Speaker 2>regarded as one of the founders of </v>
<v Speaker 2>modern psychology,</v>

343
00:18:03.301 --> 00:18:04.134
<v Speaker 2>even though he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't be allowed on a faculty of </v>

344
00:18:07.561 --> 00:18:09.080
<v Speaker 2>psychology today because he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

345
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.490
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like the first Hippie,</v>

346
00:18:11.491 --> 00:18:12.324
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some sense because he liked to </v>

347
00:18:13.231 --> 00:18:17.010
<v Speaker 2>experiment with things like a laughing </v>
<v Speaker 2>gas,</v>

348
00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:19.920
<v Speaker 2>nitrous oxide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nitric oxide,</v>

349
00:18:19.921 --> 00:18:20.754
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

350
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:21.540
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

351
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.930
<v Speaker 2>it's actually quite an intense </v>
<v Speaker 2>hallucinogen at the appropriate doses.</v>

352
00:18:24.931 --> 00:18:25.764
<v Speaker 2>And he wrote like sixties acid freak </v>
<v Speaker 2>poetry back in 1880 when he was on </v>

353
00:18:30.961 --> 00:18:32.010
<v Speaker 2>nitrous oxide.</v>

354
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:33.570
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

355
00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:37.770
<v Speaker 2>he was very curious about phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like religious experience and so forth.</v>

356
00:18:37.771 --> 00:18:41.260
<v Speaker 2>So he was very philosophically minded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologist and,</v>

357
00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:42.960
<v Speaker 2>and had some very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

358
00:18:42.961 --> 00:18:44.100
<v Speaker 2>he was brave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

359
00:18:44.101 --> 00:18:44.934
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which sometimes being weird and being </v>

360
00:18:47.071 --> 00:18:48.240
<v Speaker 2>braver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same thing.</v>

361
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:52.860
<v Speaker 2>He was also unbelievably intelligent and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a group of people around them and</v>

362
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:53.783
<v Speaker 2>including a guy named Charles purse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's one of the on one of the West's </v>

363
00:18:57.301 --> 00:18:59.580
<v Speaker 2>greatest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively unknown philosophers.</v>

364
00:18:59.581 --> 00:19:00.414
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they set up a new field of philosophy </v>

365
00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:06.660
<v Speaker 2>which is classically regarded as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>only American philosophy.</v>

366
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.530
<v Speaker 2>And that philosophy was pragmatism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

367
00:19:09.531 --> 00:19:12.700
<v Speaker 2>and when you call someone pragmatic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you sort of mean well,</v>

368
00:19:12.701 --> 00:19:14.330
<v Speaker 2>they're willing to do what works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

369
00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.173
<v Speaker 2>they're concerned with what works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's kind of pragmatism in a </v>

370
00:19:17.731 --> 00:19:20.520
<v Speaker 2>nutshell in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except it's a lot more sophisticated.</v>

371
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.370
<v Speaker 2>The pragmatist would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

372
00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:24.863
<v Speaker 2>you've got a problem and the problem is </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know everything and what that </v>

373
00:19:28.291 --> 00:19:33.120
<v Speaker 2>means in some senses that all of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge about anything is limited even</v>

374
00:19:33.121 --> 00:19:34.800
<v Speaker 2>about the things that you think you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

375
00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.830
<v Speaker 2>It's limited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you can never be sure.</v>

376
00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:38.693
<v Speaker 2>You can never be certain that what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with is what you think </v>

377
00:19:40.651 --> 00:19:43.920
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with or that when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with it,</v>

378
00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.520
<v Speaker 2>what you expect to happen will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

379
00:19:47.521 --> 00:19:48.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might think,</v>

380
00:19:48.361 --> 00:19:49.560
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand my,</v>

381
00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:50.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

382
00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.400
<v Speaker 2>I understand this can of coke </v>
<v Speaker 2>sufficiently,</v>

383
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can drink it and so on.</v>

384
00:19:55.171 --> 00:19:58.560
<v Speaker 2>And so my knowledge is as close to </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute as it needs to be,</v>

385
00:19:58.561 --> 00:19:59.394
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has aspartame in it and everybody </v>

386
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.200
<v Speaker 2>thinks aspartame is dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's probably not,</v>

387
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.530
<v Speaker 2>but probably it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

388
00:20:07.531 --> 00:20:10.890
<v Speaker 2>and so who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I drink 100 of these things,</v>

389
00:20:10.891 --> 00:20:13.140
<v Speaker 2>that might be the end of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And wouldn't that be stupid?</v>

390
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:14.333
<v Speaker 2>So the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that because you're surrounded by a </v>

391
00:20:17.041 --> 00:20:20.970
<v Speaker 2>cloud of ignorance that you cannot get </v>
<v Speaker 2>rid of none of your judgments about what</v>

392
00:20:20.971 --> 00:20:22.830
<v Speaker 2>constitutes truth can be final.</v>

393
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:23.933
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pragmatists we're trying to figure out </v>

394
00:20:25.441 --> 00:20:26.640
<v Speaker 2>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given that,</v>

395
00:20:26.641 --> 00:20:30.470
<v Speaker 2>how can you even act because you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>compute well.</v>

396
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:35.250
<v Speaker 2>And this came up again in the 19 sixties</v>
<v Speaker 2>and is really bothered people since then</v>

397
00:20:35.251 --> 00:20:36.084
<v Speaker 2>in the guise of the frame problem is you</v>
<v Speaker 2>cannot compute all the consequences of </v>

398
00:20:39.241 --> 00:20:42.570
<v Speaker 2>your actions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how can you act?</v>

399
00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:47.690
<v Speaker 2>How can you feel that you have enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge to act so well?</v>

400
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.950
<v Speaker 2>It's a very difficult problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's unbelievably difficult problem.</v>

401
00:20:50.951 --> 00:20:54.910
<v Speaker 2>It's actually one of the problems that </v>
<v Speaker 2>has made developing intelligent machines</v>

402
00:20:54.911 --> 00:20:55.744
<v Speaker 2>much more difficult than anyone thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be because it turns out that </v>

403
00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:58.833
<v Speaker 2>not only are there an infinite number of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that could happen as a </v>

404
00:21:01.301 --> 00:21:05.590
<v Speaker 2>consequence of a given action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's also a virtually infinite number</v>

405
00:21:05.591 --> 00:21:08.800
<v Speaker 2>of ways to look at a situation to </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceive it.</v>

406
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:12.100
<v Speaker 2>We look at a situation and there it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so we just think it's given,</v>

407
00:21:12.101 --> 00:21:16.810
<v Speaker 2>but it turns out that that's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously wrong and the only reason that</v>

408
00:21:16.811 --> 00:21:20.350
<v Speaker 2>when we look at the world that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>given is because our psyche,</v>

409
00:21:20.351 --> 00:21:21.184
<v Speaker 2>our consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we still think of as sort of a </v>

410
00:21:22.811 --> 00:21:23.644
<v Speaker 2>soul,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is actually something that is grounded </v>

411
00:21:26.081 --> 00:21:26.914
<v Speaker 2>deeply in the biological processes of </v>
<v Speaker 2>our body and that all of those </v>

412
00:21:30.311 --> 00:21:31.144
<v Speaker 2>biological processes that were created </v>
<v Speaker 2>over evolutionary time structure our </v>

413
00:21:34.691 --> 00:21:38.200
<v Speaker 2>perceptions before we even know it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just deliver this world to us.</v>

414
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:39.970
<v Speaker 2>So it looks obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

415
00:21:39.971 --> 00:21:40.804
<v Speaker 2>it took a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've been evolving for like 3 billion </v>

416
00:21:43.091 --> 00:21:43.924
<v Speaker 2>years or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it took a lot of tinkering around to </v>

417
00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.820
<v Speaker 2>get this perceptual system to do what it</v>
<v Speaker 2>does,</v>

418
00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:50.163
<v Speaker 2>so okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're very interested in and how </v>

419
00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.590
<v Speaker 2>you came up with ideas of truth and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

420
00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:57.483
<v Speaker 2>What they settled on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roughly speaking is something like </v>

421
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.570
<v Speaker 2>whenever you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever you conduct an action,</v>

422
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:05.853
<v Speaker 2>you set up the criteria for determining </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether what you're doing is is </v>

423
00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:11.163
<v Speaker 2>reasonable or factual based on outcome </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you want to attain and so for the </v>

424
00:22:15.221 --> 00:22:16.054
<v Speaker 2>pragmatists was more like things were </v>
<v Speaker 2>true enough and so if my goal in </v>

425
00:22:20.501 --> 00:22:25.501
<v Speaker 2>interacting with his coke can is to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a drink and when I do what I am going to</v>

426
00:22:27.601 --> 00:22:28.434
<v Speaker 2>do and I get a drink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then not sufficiently true and I can go </v>

427
00:22:30.541 --> 00:22:32.610
<v Speaker 2>onto the next thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

428
00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:33.593
<v Speaker 2>but it's still tenuous because it leaves</v>
<v Speaker 2>open other questions like should I be </v>

429
00:22:36.991 --> 00:22:38.800
<v Speaker 2>drinking this or something else or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

430
00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.880
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It leaves open all sorts of questions,</v>

431
00:22:41.881 --> 00:22:44.160
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter as far as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pragmatists are concerned.</v>

432
00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:47.100
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Darwin</v>

433
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:53.830
<v Speaker 2>published his theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pragmatists God on it right away,</v>

434
00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:54.693
<v Speaker 2>they were really interested in Darwinian</v>
<v Speaker 2>theory because they regarded it as a </v>

435
00:22:56.771 --> 00:22:59.680
<v Speaker 2>version of pragmatism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is quite cool,</v>

436
00:22:59.681 --> 00:23:00.514
<v Speaker 2>and they did this within,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think within five years of its </v>

437
00:23:02.411 --> 00:23:03.970
<v Speaker 2>publication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what caused credit,</v>

438
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.340
<v Speaker 2>quite disturbed people were sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ready for the theory,</v>

439
00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:07.413
<v Speaker 2>but the pragmatists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're really all over it because they </v>

440
00:23:09.221 --> 00:23:10.054
<v Speaker 2>thought of the mechanism that Darwin </v>
<v Speaker 2>described to account for evolution as a </v>

441
00:23:13.331 --> 00:23:17.350
<v Speaker 2>pragmatic mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that's an interesting idea.</v>

442
00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:22.500
<v Speaker 2>So think about it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how much do you need to know?</v>

443
00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:30.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a Darwinian perspective,</v>

444
00:23:30.291 --> 00:23:31.124
<v Speaker 2>there's an answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to know enough so that you can </v>

445
00:23:33.501 --> 00:23:36.560
<v Speaker 2>last long enough to pass your genes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the next generation.</v>

446
00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:40.580
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the Darwinians would also say,</v>

447
00:23:40.581 --> 00:23:41.414
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously you're knowledge is faulting </v>

448
00:23:42.831 --> 00:23:43.664
<v Speaker 2>incomplete because you know your to </v>
<v Speaker 2>transmit your genetic material to the </v>

449
00:23:47.871 --> 00:23:50.150
<v Speaker 2>next generation is somewhat limited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

450
00:23:50.151 --> 00:23:52.940
<v Speaker 2>you have limited number of partners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plus you die,</v>

451
00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:58.420
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that you die indicates that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you as a solution to the problem of,</v>

452
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:05.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of maintaining your own life.</v>

453
00:24:05.811 --> 00:24:07.730
<v Speaker 2>And reproducing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like a partial solution,</v>

454
00:24:07.731 --> 00:24:08.564
<v Speaker 2>you're a good enough solution you'll do </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the 30 years or the 35 years or the </v>

455
00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:16.690
<v Speaker 2>40 years that you're likely to be active</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

456
00:24:16.691 --> 00:24:17.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

457
00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.840
<v Speaker 2>in a functionally reproductive sets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're a good enough answer,</v>

458
00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.940
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Darwinian send,</v>

459
00:24:22.941 --> 00:24:23.774
<v Speaker 2>the pragmatists also said something else</v>
<v Speaker 2>or implied something else which is your </v>

460
00:24:26.751 --> 00:24:27.584
<v Speaker 2>good enough.</v>

461
00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:31.670
<v Speaker 2>And also not only is that as good as it </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets,</v>

462
00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:33.913
<v Speaker 2>it's also as good as it can get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they put some really stringent </v>

463
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:39.043
<v Speaker 2>restrictions on what would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you would regard as a sufficient </v>

464
00:24:43.641 --> 00:24:44.474
<v Speaker 2>solution to a given problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that was that while </v>

465
00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:52.640
<v Speaker 2>that your knowledge is limited and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>things transform unexpectedly,</v>

466
00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:56.150
<v Speaker 2>and so the best thing you could do is </v>
<v Speaker 2>run along and try to keep up.</v>

467
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:57.343
<v Speaker 2>And you'll never really do much better </v>
<v Speaker 2>than that in some sense because things </v>

468
00:25:00.711 --> 00:25:03.920
<v Speaker 2>are unpredictable and because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>change in an unpredictable way.</v>

469
00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:09.320
<v Speaker 2>So now the final part of the argument is</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

470
00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:15.130
<v Speaker 2>So then what are we to regard as truth?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now leave the materialist claims aside.</v>

471
00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:17.053
<v Speaker 2>I'm perfectly willing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it would be ridiculous not </v>

472
00:25:19.131 --> 00:25:23.390
<v Speaker 2>to that that's a form of truth that at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least is very useful,</v>

473
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.230
<v Speaker 2>so fine.</v>

474
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:26.880
<v Speaker 2>It's a tool and maybe more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it may.</v>

475
00:25:26.881 --> 00:25:29.690
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it is saying something about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute nature of reality.</v>

476
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:33.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least it's a useful tool for us.</v>

477
00:25:33.861 --> 00:25:34.694
<v Speaker 2>It's made us more powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then we have this other problem </v>

478
00:25:36.231 --> 00:25:38.750
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

479
00:25:38.751 --> 00:25:39.584
<v Speaker 2>what about the nature of the system that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's embedded in like how do we </v>

480
00:25:42.351 --> 00:25:45.920
<v Speaker 2>determine its utility or how do we </v>
<v Speaker 2>determine the utility of anything or how</v>

481
00:25:45.921 --> 00:25:46.754
<v Speaker 2>do we determine how to act or how do we </v>
<v Speaker 2>determine what to value and those </v>

482
00:25:50.571 --> 00:25:52.850
<v Speaker 2>questions can be asked using this </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer,</v>

483
00:25:52.851 --> 00:25:56.750
<v Speaker 2>using the same methodology that science </v>
<v Speaker 2>uses to answer his questions.</v>

484
00:25:56.751 --> 00:26:01.670
<v Speaker 2>Now the consequence of that is what </v>
<v Speaker 2>needs you described at the end of the 19</v>

485
00:26:01.671 --> 00:26:03.470
<v Speaker 2>hundreds as the death of God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

486
00:26:03.471 --> 00:26:05.090
<v Speaker 2>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a conflict,</v>

487
00:26:05.091 --> 00:26:07.940
<v Speaker 2>a serious conflict between the claims of</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>

488
00:26:07.941 --> 00:26:12.350
<v Speaker 2>which as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to do with value and moral morality</v>

489
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:17.500
<v Speaker 2>and the claims of science which are </v>
<v Speaker 2>which have to do with material reality.</v>

490
00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:19.710
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now</v>

491
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:33.190
<v Speaker 2>the tricky part comes in realizing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the selection mechanisms that determined</v>

492
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:36.463
<v Speaker 2>what happens to you in relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the next generation say are selecting </v>

493
00:26:41.961 --> 00:26:45.180
<v Speaker 2>you on the of your action and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>

494
00:26:45.181 --> 00:26:48.720
<v Speaker 2>I would say they're selecting you on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>basis of your values,</v>

495
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:50.093
<v Speaker 2>so because you know if you're a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're an idiot saying you go </v>

496
00:26:53.251 --> 00:26:55.320
<v Speaker 2>charging after a lion and the lion eats </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

497
00:26:55.321 --> 00:26:58.920
<v Speaker 2>then the the nature of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

498
00:26:58.921 --> 00:26:59.754
<v Speaker 2>is rendered a judgment on the value </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure that sent you down that </v>

499
00:27:02.311 --> 00:27:03.990
<v Speaker 2>particular path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

500
00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:09.290
<v Speaker 2>and so you're being selected by natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>forces as a consequence of your behavior</v>

501
00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.810
<v Speaker 2>now and then we can extend that </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument,</v>

502
00:27:12.811 --> 00:27:16.500
<v Speaker 2>especially in the human case or in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>case of any organism that's also subject</v>

503
00:27:16.501 --> 00:27:17.334
<v Speaker 2>to sexual selection and human beings are</v>
<v Speaker 2>tremendously subject to sexual </v>

504
00:27:21.121 --> 00:27:22.200
<v Speaker 2>selection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

505
00:27:22.201 --> 00:27:24.840
<v Speaker 2>Darwin was a great believer in sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>selection.</v>

506
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:26.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

507
00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:27.083
<v Speaker 2>he thought it was at least as important </v>
<v Speaker 2>as the selection of the organism by the </v>

508
00:27:30.421 --> 00:27:32.370
<v Speaker 2>natural environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that is.</v>

509
00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:33.683
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>biologists really had a hard time with </v>

510
00:27:35.401 --> 00:27:38.190
<v Speaker 2>that and they kind of ignored sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>selection for 100 years,</v>

511
00:27:38.191 --> 00:27:39.024
<v Speaker 2>which is quite a quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was partly because sexual </v>

512
00:27:42.001 --> 00:27:42.834
<v Speaker 2>selection implies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're dealing with </v>

513
00:27:44.581 --> 00:27:47.160
<v Speaker 2>organisms that are sort of conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like human beings,</v>

514
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:52.430
<v Speaker 2>that choice itself is a determinant of </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary processes.</v>

515
00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:54.780
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

516
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:55.703
<v Speaker 2>the district deterministic materialists </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't really like that and they </v>

517
00:27:58.771 --> 00:28:00.420
<v Speaker 2>couldn't really come up with an argument</v>
<v Speaker 2>against it,</v>

518
00:28:00.421 --> 00:28:03.240
<v Speaker 2>but they sort of shelved the whole topic</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a very long period of time.</v>

519
00:28:03.241 --> 00:28:04.074
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things we know for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example about human beings is that </v>

520
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:07.133
<v Speaker 2>females are very sexually selective </v>
<v Speaker 2>female humans as opposed to say to </v>

521
00:28:10.351 --> 00:28:11.184
<v Speaker 2>female chimps which aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so part of the consequence of that </v>

522
00:28:14.671 --> 00:28:18.660
<v Speaker 2>is that you have twice as many female </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancestors as you do mail ancestors.</v>

523
00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:19.733
<v Speaker 2>Now there'll be half of you are going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a hell of a time figuring out how </v>

524
00:28:21.601 --> 00:28:23.940
<v Speaker 2>that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it is possible.</v>

525
00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:24.863
<v Speaker 2>But it really means is that something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the average male who's in your </v>

526
00:28:29.161 --> 00:28:33.870
<v Speaker 2>ancestry had two children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he had any,</v>

527
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:39.210
<v Speaker 2>whereas the average woman had one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that'll do the trick right there.</v>

528
00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:40.103
<v Speaker 2>Right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying those were the exact </v>

529
00:28:41.221 --> 00:28:42.054
<v Speaker 2>proportions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those are the average proportions </v>

530
00:28:43.351 --> 00:28:46.860
<v Speaker 2>across huge spans of time now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

531
00:28:46.861 --> 00:28:47.694
<v Speaker 2>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so part of what's occurred to select </v>

532
00:28:50.761 --> 00:28:51.594
<v Speaker 2>human beings for the way they are is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>choices that each gender has made with </v>

533
00:28:55.861 --> 00:28:56.694
<v Speaker 2>regards to action and belief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in many ways more specifically </v>

534
00:29:02.401 --> 00:29:04.570
<v Speaker 2>female choices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's kind of an interesting.</v>

535
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:06.480
<v Speaker 2>The next time you were irritated at your</v>
<v Speaker 2>boyfriend,</v>

536
00:29:06.481 --> 00:29:07.314
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can just remember that you </v>

537
00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:11.580
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>untold millions of women have chosen men</v>

538
00:29:11.581 --> 00:29:13.200
<v Speaker 2>so that they're exactly like he is.</v>

539
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.250
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

540
00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:17.730
<v Speaker 2>you can't really blame them for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all right,</v>

541
00:29:17.731 --> 00:29:18.130
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

542
00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:18.963
<v Speaker 2>but here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing that's tricky from a </v>

543
00:29:20.761 --> 00:29:22.200
<v Speaker 2>scientific perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

544
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.940
<v Speaker 2>if it is your behavior and your value </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures,</v>

545
00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:30.150
<v Speaker 2>if your value structures determine what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're interested in,</v>

546
00:29:30.151 --> 00:29:35.151
<v Speaker 2>how you behave and selection pressure </v>
<v Speaker 2>occurs as a consequence of your actions,</v>

547
00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:37.613
<v Speaker 2>then doesn't it mean that the structure </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the value systems that your behavior </v>

548
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:47.250
<v Speaker 2>have to be regarded as true or real in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some scientific sense because the Darwin</v>

549
00:29:48.661 --> 00:29:50.110
<v Speaker 2>is basically say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

550
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.800
<v Speaker 2>the best solution is the solution that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you embodied.</v>

551
00:29:53.801 --> 00:29:58.480
<v Speaker 2>There is no higher solution than that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there you are embodying a solution.</v>

552
00:29:58.481 --> 00:29:59.314
<v Speaker 2>So in what way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand in what way that </v>

553
00:30:01.931 --> 00:30:04.050
<v Speaker 2>can't be regarded as real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

554
00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.890
<v Speaker 2>because people think of things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>value structures as EPA,</v>

555
00:30:06.891 --> 00:30:08.170
<v Speaker 2>phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

556
00:30:08.171 --> 00:30:11.290
<v Speaker 2>they're not real like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like material is real,</v>

557
00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:12.490
<v Speaker 2>but I don't get that.</v>

558
00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:13.383
<v Speaker 2>I don't see how that works with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Darwinian thinking because you're </v>

559
00:30:16.391 --> 00:30:17.224
<v Speaker 2>interacting with each other all the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're doing that on the basis of </v>

560
00:30:19.571 --> 00:30:22.540
<v Speaker 2>your capacity for action and the value </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems that drive that.</v>

561
00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:27.280
<v Speaker 2>And obviously those have some effect on </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not you're selected by women.</v>

562
00:30:27.281 --> 00:30:30.490
<v Speaker 2>Say or by men for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also by the natural world,</v>

563
00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:31.743
<v Speaker 2>so it looks like it looks to me at least</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can make a case that the deep value </v>

564
00:30:37.541 --> 00:30:39.970
<v Speaker 2>structures that drive us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are deep,</v>

565
00:30:39.971 --> 00:30:43.570
<v Speaker 2>deep parts of our psyche and I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll try to also demonstrate to you that</v>

566
00:30:43.571 --> 00:30:44.404
<v Speaker 2>those exist beyond question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I already think that question is </v>

567
00:30:47.231 --> 00:30:48.530
<v Speaker 2>answered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

568
00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:51.520
<v Speaker 2>there's no blank slate theorists left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

569
00:30:51.521 --> 00:30:55.810
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows that you come into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world with an a priori structure.</v>

570
00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.120
<v Speaker 2>It's like that a prior restructure was </v>
<v Speaker 2>selected.</v>

571
00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:01.810
<v Speaker 2>So in what way is it not true?</v>

572
00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:02.981
<v Speaker 2>I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

573
00:31:02.981 --> 00:31:05.020
<v Speaker 2>it's as true as it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

574
00:31:05.021 --> 00:31:07.870
<v Speaker 2>it's not true like a materialist idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's okay.</v>

575
00:31:07.871 --> 00:31:10.000
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

576
00:31:10.001 --> 00:31:10.834
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the materialist ideas of </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth are the most fundamental ideas </v>

577
00:31:13.091 --> 00:31:17.740
<v Speaker 2>because as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order for that truth to be relevant,</v>

578
00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.870
<v Speaker 2>it has to be grounded in the value </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

579
00:31:19.871 --> 00:31:23.470
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a value system outside of</v>
<v Speaker 2>science that science serves.</v>

580
00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:27.730
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise we'd be completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be insane for us to pursue it,</v>

581
00:31:27.731 --> 00:31:28.564
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we knew that science was going to </v>

582
00:31:30.671 --> 00:31:33.490
<v Speaker 2>lead to the demise of everyone on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which it could,</v>

583
00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:35.223
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't be motivated to pursue it </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you knew that science was just going </v>

584
00:31:38.111 --> 00:31:40.410
<v Speaker 2>to increase your suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a scientist.</v>

585
00:31:40.411 --> 00:31:41.244
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you stop doing it if you had </v>

586
00:31:42.401 --> 00:31:44.290
<v Speaker 2>any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

587
00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:45.940
<v Speaker 2>so then I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

588
00:31:45.941 --> 00:31:49.540
<v Speaker 2>we pursue materialists truths for </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons that are known.</v>

589
00:31:49.541 --> 00:31:53.530
<v Speaker 2>Materialist and those reasons are just </v>
<v Speaker 2>as real as the materialist truth,</v>

590
00:31:53.531 --> 00:31:55.120
<v Speaker 2>but there are different kinds of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>

591
00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.070
<v Speaker 2>They're a seriously different kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth</v>

592
00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:08.510
<v Speaker 4>changes over time.</v>

593
00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:12.770
<v Speaker 2>Good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

594
00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:16.770
<v Speaker 2>I would say I would say they change at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least to some degree,</v>

595
00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

596
00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:19.853
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what values you share with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the primate who was your ancestor and </v>

597
00:32:23.971 --> 00:32:28.160
<v Speaker 2>the ancestor of chimpanzees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would say there's a,</v>

598
00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.710
<v Speaker 2>there's no shortage of similarities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

599
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:32.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

600
00:32:32.671 --> 00:32:35.070
<v Speaker 2>we can understand chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

601
00:32:35.071 --> 00:32:37.890
<v Speaker 2>more or less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can understand dogs,</v>

602
00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:38.753
<v Speaker 2>we can understand cats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My daughter had lizards and the more </v>

603
00:32:41.271 --> 00:32:43.850
<v Speaker 2>social lizards there are social lizards </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

604
00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:46.370
<v Speaker 2>you can kind of understand the social </v>
<v Speaker 2>lizard,</v>

605
00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we certainly understand all mammals.</v>

606
00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:51.293
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there are other animals that </v>

607
00:32:53.601 --> 00:32:54.434
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have deviated from at far </v>

608
00:33:00.201 --> 00:33:01.034
<v Speaker 2>greater spans of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked the example of crustaceans </v>

609
00:33:04.911 --> 00:33:05.744
<v Speaker 2>because I happen to know a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>about lobsters for reasons that were in </v>

610
00:33:09.021 --> 00:33:10.670
<v Speaker 2>my reading,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took me in a random direction,</v>

611
00:33:10.671 --> 00:33:11.504
<v Speaker 2>but like lobsters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lobsters organized themselves into </v>

612
00:33:13.941 --> 00:33:14.774
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchies and we understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchies and even more </v>

613
00:33:18.561 --> 00:33:19.394
<v Speaker 2>strangely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biochemical systems that the </v>

614
00:33:22.641 --> 00:33:23.474
<v Speaker 2>lobsters use to track their dominance </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies and to determine how </v>

615
00:33:27.771 --> 00:33:28.604
<v Speaker 2>confident they should be or how </v>
<v Speaker 2>submissive are serotonergic and so are </v>

616
00:33:33.741 --> 00:33:35.900
<v Speaker 2>the systems we use to track dominance </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies.</v>

617
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:36.943
<v Speaker 2>And the similarity is so great that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can actually use antidepressants on </v>

618
00:33:39.501 --> 00:33:40.334
<v Speaker 2>lobsters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you inject the lobster with </v>

619
00:33:42.711 --> 00:33:44.600
<v Speaker 2>Serotonin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the precise procedure,</v>

620
00:33:44.601 --> 00:33:49.370
<v Speaker 2>but generally if a lobster has lost a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight and he liked zooms into his little</v>

621
00:33:49.371 --> 00:33:53.420
<v Speaker 2>lobster place and like pouts for at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least 20 minutes,</v>

622
00:33:53.421 --> 00:33:56.190
<v Speaker 2>he won't fight with anyone else during </v>
<v Speaker 2>that period of time.</v>

623
00:33:56.191 --> 00:33:58.550
<v Speaker 2>And when he comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like a smaller lobster,</v>

624
00:33:58.551 --> 00:34:00.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he sort of determines how big to</v>

625
00:34:00.711 --> 00:34:03.590
<v Speaker 2>be on the basis of the ratio of </v>
<v Speaker 2>victories.</v>

626
00:34:03.591 --> 00:34:07.340
<v Speaker 2>Two defeats and the mechanism that </v>
<v Speaker 2>adjusts his posture,</v>

627
00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:08.413
<v Speaker 2>the successful lobster gets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>takes up more and more space because he </v>

628
00:34:10.611 --> 00:34:11.330
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

629
00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:13.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm as big as I think I am.</v>

630
00:34:13.341 --> 00:34:14.174
<v Speaker 2>And that's based on my success in battle</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Sarah to energetically mediated as </v>

631
00:34:17.841 --> 00:34:18.700
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

632
00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:21.230
<v Speaker 2>And so when you see a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like this,</v>

633
00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:24.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking up as little space as possible.</v>

634
00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:25.393
<v Speaker 2>You can think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there's a defeated lobster because </v>

635
00:34:26.871 --> 00:34:27.704
<v Speaker 2>it's exactly the same mechanisms and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really fundamental in human </v>

636
00:34:30.471 --> 00:34:32.990
<v Speaker 2>beings and you can't really change them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

637
00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:37.960
<v Speaker 2>like the way your brain computes your </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance effects,</v>

638
00:34:37.961 --> 00:34:40.910
<v Speaker 2>how much positive emotion you have and </v>
<v Speaker 2>how much negative emotion.</v>

639
00:34:40.911 --> 00:34:41.744
<v Speaker 2>And if you're way the hell down in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy or you feel that </v>

640
00:34:44.511 --> 00:34:48.380
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to experience way more</v>

641
00:34:48.381 --> 00:34:49.214
<v Speaker 2>negative emotion because your nervous </v>
<v Speaker 2>system has calculated that the </v>

642
00:34:52.101 --> 00:34:54.920
<v Speaker 2>environment on average is very dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 2>to you,</v>

643
00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:55.773
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] you're barely clinging to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the edge of reality and you're going to </v>

644
00:34:58.401 --> 00:35:01.640
<v Speaker 2>experience very little positive emotion </v>
<v Speaker 2>because well,</v>

645
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:03.980
<v Speaker 2>things don't look that good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

646
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:05.023
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those aren't really systems you can </v>

647
00:35:06.141 --> 00:35:07.420
<v Speaker 2>control their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

648
00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:11.900
<v Speaker 2>their like master operating systems that</v>
<v Speaker 2>sit at the base of your brain,</v>

649
00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:13.790
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you say,</v>

650
00:35:13.791 --> 00:35:15.710
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do things change across time?</v>

651
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:16.790
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

652
00:35:16.791 --> 00:35:21.791
<v Speaker 2>but they change within constraints that </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't change much across time.</v>

653
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.863
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's probably as much it's </v>

654
00:35:26.541 --> 00:35:27.374
<v Speaker 2>reasonable to assume that there's as </v>
<v Speaker 2>much conservation of value as there is </v>

655
00:35:32.361 --> 00:35:37.361
<v Speaker 2>con as there is a retention of skeletal </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure,</v>

656
00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:40.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I went at least that much.</v>

657
00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:42.090
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's actually more,</v>

658
00:35:42.091 --> 00:35:43.800
<v Speaker 2>but certainly there's at least that </v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

659
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:44.873
<v Speaker 2>I went to the Smithsonian at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the Smithsonian in </v>

660
00:35:47.221 --> 00:35:48.450
<v Speaker 2>Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they have a,</v>

661
00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:50.723
<v Speaker 2>they have a display of a mammalian </v>
<v Speaker 2>skeletons in there that's extremely </v>

662
00:35:54.181 --> 00:35:55.014
<v Speaker 2>extensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's everything from little batch to </v>

663
00:35:56.461 --> 00:35:57.294
<v Speaker 2>Wales and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really interesting to walk through </v>

664
00:35:58.831 --> 00:36:02.880
<v Speaker 2>that because what you see is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's basically a bat,</v>

665
00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:06.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bats look exactly like us skeletally</v>

666
00:36:06.181 --> 00:36:08.190
<v Speaker 2>except their fingers are way longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

667
00:36:08.191 --> 00:36:13.191
<v Speaker 2>there's all that's happened is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are transformations of size in the</v>

668
00:36:13.561 --> 00:36:14.880
<v Speaker 2>basic skeletal structure.</v>

669
00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:18.690
<v Speaker 2>The structure itself is virtually </v>
<v Speaker 2>identical across mammals,</v>

670
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.033
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so in evolution is a conservative </v>

671
00:36:21.301 --> 00:36:22.111
<v Speaker 2>process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

672
00:36:22.111 --> 00:36:26.040
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't go zipping off and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely random direction.</v>

673
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:27.383
<v Speaker 2>And so I would say also the way to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it is that there are levels of </v>

674
00:36:30.001 --> 00:36:30.834
<v Speaker 2>stability in the evolutionary process </v>
<v Speaker 2>and some domains are extremely stable </v>

675
00:36:35.431 --> 00:36:36.264
<v Speaker 2>across time and one of them happens to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be the existence of a dominance </v>

676
00:36:39.451 --> 00:36:42.420
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's at least 400 million years old.</v>

677
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:45.390
<v Speaker 2>And that's old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's older than trees.</v>

678
00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:49.020
<v Speaker 2>So if you're trying to think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's actually real,</v>

679
00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:50.183
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't see a dominance hierarchy and </v>

680
00:36:51.331 --> 00:36:55.080
<v Speaker 2>you can't taste it or touch it or </v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitive in any real way,</v>

681
00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:56.153
<v Speaker 2>but dominance hierarchies are more real </v>
<v Speaker 2>than almost anything that you ever come </v>

682
00:36:58.351 --> 00:36:59.184
<v Speaker 2>across there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're probably not quite as real as </v>

683
00:37:00.811 --> 00:37:03.060
<v Speaker 2>rocks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're,</v>

684
00:37:03.061 --> 00:37:07.560
<v Speaker 2>they're real enough so that both you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>lobsters organize yourself into them and</v>

685
00:37:07.561 --> 00:37:08.394
<v Speaker 2>understand them.</v>

686
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:11.430
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yes,</v>

687
00:37:11.431 --> 00:37:12.390
<v Speaker 2>there's change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>

688
00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:13.373
<v Speaker 2>it's changed within constraints.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think maybe one of the ways to </v>

689
00:37:16.231 --> 00:37:17.490
<v Speaker 2>understand that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

690
00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:21.030
<v Speaker 2>it's something like the variation in </v>
<v Speaker 2>languages,</v>

691
00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:24.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our language is the same or different.</v>

692
00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depends on your level of analysis.</v>

693
00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:28.763
<v Speaker 2>There are levels of analysis at which </v>
<v Speaker 2>the commonalities are what's most </v>

694
00:37:32.251 --> 00:37:35.700
<v Speaker 2>manifest and their levels of analysis </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the differences are most manifest.</v>

695
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:36.743
<v Speaker 2>But I like to think about it as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy and there's fundamental </v>

696
00:37:39.361 --> 00:37:43.560
<v Speaker 2>elements at the base of the hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they don't change their,</v>

697
00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:44.953
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life made a bet 400 million years ago </v>

698
00:37:48.931 --> 00:37:51.270
<v Speaker 2>and it was one of those bets that's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to change.</v>

699
00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:52.283
<v Speaker 2>The dominance hierarchy is something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to feature a lot in our </v>

700
00:37:54.211 --> 00:37:59.211
<v Speaker 2>conversations because it's such a stable</v>
<v Speaker 2>element of the environment that it's one</v>

701
00:38:01.501 --> 00:38:02.334
<v Speaker 2>of the fund,</v>
<v Speaker 2>its existence and its nature is one of </v>

702
00:38:05.611 --> 00:38:06.444
<v Speaker 2>the fundamental presumptions of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>being and so there it's extremely </v>

703
00:38:10.261 --> 00:38:10.710
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

704
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:13.980
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that women do with men</v>

705
00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.233
<v Speaker 2>and men do it with women as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they use different criteria is men </v>

706
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:19.583
<v Speaker 2>are very competitive in a certain manner</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the women assume that the guys who </v>

707
00:38:23.911 --> 00:38:24.744
<v Speaker 2>win are the better men and they just </v>
<v Speaker 2>peel them from the top and so the </v>

708
00:38:27.121 --> 00:38:27.954
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy and part female </v>
<v Speaker 2>selection is one of the things that </v>

709
00:38:30.631 --> 00:38:34.710
<v Speaker 2>determines whether male genes have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular type go into the future,</v>

710
00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:35.763
<v Speaker 2>but so is the structure of the dominance</v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy because if you're at the </v>

711
00:38:38.051 --> 00:38:39.040
<v Speaker 2>bottom of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

712
00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.110
<v Speaker 2>good luck finding a partner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

713
00:38:41.111 --> 00:38:43.450
<v Speaker 2>very unlikely unless it's random and </v>
<v Speaker 2>impulsive,</v>

714
00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:46.030
<v Speaker 2>so or involuntary.</v>

715
00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:51.910
<v Speaker 1>So yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

716
00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:56.283
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to say about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually you don't because I think that </v>

717
00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:05.250
<v Speaker 2>they both ground out in true and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that grounds out in,</v>

718
00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:08.703
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Darwinian theory that's at the </v>

719
00:39:09.851 --> 00:39:13.420
<v Speaker 2>bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because the question is,</v>

720
00:39:13.421 --> 00:39:15.460
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think is,</v>

721
00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:19.620
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let,</v>

722
00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:22.490
<v Speaker 2>let me put it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can see he see what you think of</v>

723
00:39:22.491 --> 00:39:24.080
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's a claim.</v>

724
00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:26.933
<v Speaker 2>Our theory about the atomic substructure</v>
<v Speaker 2>of material entities is sufficiently </v>

725
00:39:31.471 --> 00:39:34.740
<v Speaker 2>accurate so that we can make </v>
<v Speaker 2>thermonuclear bombs,</v>

726
00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:35.993
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody agrees with that because </v>

727
00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:38.610
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are thermonuclear bombs.</v>

728
00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:40.883
<v Speaker 2>Here's a counter proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our theory about the substructure of </v>

729
00:39:44.991 --> 00:39:49.110
<v Speaker 2>reality is so flawed that we will make </v>
<v Speaker 2>thermonuclear bombs.</v>

730
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:51.990
<v Speaker 2>Now you see now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think,</v>

731
00:39:51.991 --> 00:39:54.090
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a bad proposition either.</v>

732
00:39:54.091 --> 00:39:56.370
<v Speaker 2>So how can both of those be true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

733
00:39:56.371 --> 00:39:57.204
<v Speaker 2>here's what it looks to me is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that when you parse an entity </v>

734
00:40:02.731 --> 00:40:06.870
<v Speaker 2>out of its context,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you lose something of the entity.</v>

735
00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:09.900
<v Speaker 2>Now this is something that really </v>
<v Speaker 2>plagues psychologist,</v>

736
00:40:09.901 --> 00:40:10.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because psychologists,</v>

737
00:40:10.911 --> 00:40:14.280
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you'll go up to someone and say,</v>

738
00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:17.070
<v Speaker 2>I was angry today and the person says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

739
00:40:17.071 --> 00:40:17.904
<v Speaker 2>why were you angry?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you have a little discussion </v>

740
00:40:19.291 --> 00:40:20.124
<v Speaker 2>about why you're angry and you never </v>
<v Speaker 2>really worry about whether the person </v>

741
00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:23.693
<v Speaker 2>understands what you mean by angry </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you assume that they've been </v>

742
00:40:26.371 --> 00:40:29.160
<v Speaker 2>angry before and so have you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you share that,</v>

743
00:40:29.161 --> 00:40:29.994
<v Speaker 2>but also you also assume that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>context of the conversation defines the </v>

744
00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:35.213
<v Speaker 2>ambivalence of the word sufficiently in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that time in place so that it has an </v>

745
00:40:39.271 --> 00:40:40.170
<v Speaker 2>actual meaning.</v>

746
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:41.783
<v Speaker 2>That's the context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the person hypothetically </v>

747
00:40:44.401 --> 00:40:47.370
<v Speaker 2>because they wouldn't be telling you </v>
<v Speaker 2>that otherwise you know other people.</v>

748
00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:52.700
<v Speaker 2>You understand the language so that when</v>
<v Speaker 2>the word angry emerges that someone just</v>

749
00:40:52.741 --> 00:40:55.530
<v Speaker 2>doesn't come up and go angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know they,</v>

750
00:40:55.531 --> 00:41:00.531
<v Speaker 2>they put it in a story and so the </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning of the word angry is confined by</v>

751
00:41:00.901 --> 00:41:01.734
<v Speaker 2>the story that's constructed around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>word and that's confined by your </v>

752
00:41:03.991 --> 00:41:07.470
<v Speaker 2>relationship and the relationship is </v>
<v Speaker 2>confined by the culture that you're in.</v>

753
00:41:07.471 --> 00:41:08.304
<v Speaker 2>And so there's lots of levels of </v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis that are going on </v>

754
00:41:10.561 --> 00:41:11.394
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously for you to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what the person means when </v>

755
00:41:14.371 --> 00:41:15.204
<v Speaker 2>they talk about being angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now a psychologist to come along and </v>

756
00:41:16.981 --> 00:41:17.814
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

757
00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:20.100
<v Speaker 2>anger is a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

758
00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:23.970
<v Speaker 2>pull it out of its context and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>treat it like it's a material entity and</v>

759
00:41:23.971 --> 00:41:25.500
<v Speaker 2>actually that doesn't work very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

760
00:41:25.501 --> 00:41:26.334
<v Speaker 2>there's lots of things that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>discuss in the context of multilevel </v>

761
00:41:30.961 --> 00:41:33.590
<v Speaker 2>language that you can't just pull out as</v>
<v Speaker 2>entity.</v>

762
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:39.010
<v Speaker 2>Now with regards to our understanding of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the subatomic realm,</v>

763
00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:44.000
<v Speaker 2>well the problem is is that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>parsing out,</v>

764
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:48.950
<v Speaker 2>we're parsing out from a very complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>

765
00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:50.143
<v Speaker 2>a particular form of perception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's a very powerful form of </v>

766
00:41:53.151 --> 00:41:56.150
<v Speaker 2>perceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the form of perception that allows us to</v>

767
00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:58.550
<v Speaker 2>mess about with things at the subatomic </v>
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>

768
00:41:58.760 --> 00:41:59.593
<v Speaker 2>but while we're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of things that those </v>

769
00:42:01.911 --> 00:42:05.270
<v Speaker 2>particles are associated with that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>ignoring.</v>

770
00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:10.580
<v Speaker 2>So we narrow our knowledge in some sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>by decontextualizing the phenomena,</v>

771
00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.640
<v Speaker 2>and then we can do things like make atom</v>
<v Speaker 2>bombs.</v>

772
00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:14.773
<v Speaker 2>But the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that what makes you think that the </v>

773
00:42:18.351 --> 00:42:22.850
<v Speaker 2>process of decontextualization produces </v>
<v Speaker 2>an outcome?</v>

774
00:42:22.851 --> 00:42:23.990
<v Speaker 2>That's true?</v>

775
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:27.820
<v Speaker 2>Now you could say pragmatically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

776
00:42:27.821 --> 00:42:29.480
<v Speaker 2>it's true enough to make atom bombs </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

777
00:42:29.481 --> 00:42:30.314
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

778
00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:32.660
<v Speaker 2>but it's not true enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not to make them,</v>

779
00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.440
<v Speaker 2>so it's tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tricky.</v>

780
00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:53.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the next thing.</v>

781
00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:56.340
<v Speaker 2>That's the next thing I want to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I want to get to.</v>

782
00:42:56.341 --> 00:42:58.290
<v Speaker 2>That's actually why I have this little </v>
<v Speaker 2>diagram up there,</v>

783
00:42:58.291 --> 00:42:59.124
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to do that now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now I'm going to offer you a </v>

784
00:43:03.391 --> 00:43:06.270
<v Speaker 2>proposition and it's like a core.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get to you right away.</v>

785
00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:07.710
<v Speaker 2>How is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a core proposition.</v>

786
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:10.343
<v Speaker 2>We tend to think that our knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures are made out of facts and </v>

787
00:43:12.631 --> 00:43:13.464
<v Speaker 2>that factor about the material world and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that's not very true and </v>

788
00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.870
<v Speaker 2>it's partly because who the hell cares </v>
<v Speaker 2>about facts?</v>

789
00:43:21.871 --> 00:43:24.870
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time they just lie there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not good for anything so.</v>

790
00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:28.020
<v Speaker 2>But more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can't be right.</v>

791
00:43:28.021 --> 00:43:30.120
<v Speaker 2>It can't be right for a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>

792
00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:33.510
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the scientific endeavor is only about,</v>

793
00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:37.080
<v Speaker 2>let's say 500 years old formally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you could stretch it back.</v>

794
00:43:37.081 --> 00:43:38.790
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you can stretch it back to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Greeks.</v>

795
00:43:38.791 --> 00:43:40.830
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to look at precursors,</v>

796
00:43:40.831 --> 00:43:42.210
<v Speaker 2>but it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who cares?</v>

797
00:43:42.211 --> 00:43:44.010
<v Speaker 2>It's 2000 years there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>3000 years,</v>

798
00:43:44.011 --> 00:43:47.940
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like compared to 400 million years,</v>

799
00:43:47.941 --> 00:43:50.910
<v Speaker 2>that's it's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like dust on a.</v>

800
00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:53.220
<v Speaker 2>it's like dust on a cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing.</v>

801
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:55.620
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were doing perfectly well without the</v>

802
00:43:55.621 --> 00:44:00.030
<v Speaker 2>theory beforehand and so to animals and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know what?</v>

803
00:44:00.031 --> 00:44:04.860
<v Speaker 2>That you can define,</v>
<v Speaker 2>decide for yourself what that indicates,</v>

804
00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:08.130
<v Speaker 2>but it does indicate that you can.</v>

805
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:13.890
<v Speaker 2>You can exist in a manner that fulfills </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dark Darwinian ricart requirements,</v>

806
00:44:13.891 --> 00:44:14.724
<v Speaker 2>perfectly fine without ever formalizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>a theory about the nature of material </v>

807
00:44:17.431 --> 00:44:19.080
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so fine.</v>

808
00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:23.580
<v Speaker 2>Now the next thing is your nervous </v>
<v Speaker 2>system isn't built</v>

809
00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:26.033
<v Speaker 2>to to view the world through a cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 2>framework that's composed of empirical </v>

810
00:44:29.521 --> 00:44:33.030
<v Speaker 2>facts obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we've only been doing that for a</v>

811
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.863
<v Speaker 2>few hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chimps aren't doing that and you're </v>

812
00:44:35.641 --> 00:44:36.960
<v Speaker 2>mostly chimp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

813
00:44:36.961 --> 00:44:38.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the similarity is.</v>

814
00:44:38.621 --> 00:44:41.340
<v Speaker 2>It's like 90,</v>
<v Speaker 2>99 point nine at the genetic level.</v>

815
00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:42.600
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really high.</v>

816
00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:46.080
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like the dissimilarities are</v>
<v Speaker 2>unimportant,</v>

817
00:44:46.081 --> 00:44:50.070
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of you that's chimp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of you that's mammal.</v>

818
00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:53.160
<v Speaker 2>There's a good chunk of you that's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>a crustacean.</v>

819
00:44:53.161 --> 00:44:53.994
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously none of those entities are </v>

820
00:44:56.491 --> 00:45:00.960
<v Speaker 2>predicating their action in the world or</v>
<v Speaker 2>their knowledge of the world on material</v>

821
00:45:00.961 --> 00:45:01.681
<v Speaker 2>theories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

822
00:45:01.681 --> 00:45:03.420
<v Speaker 2>so then the question might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

823
00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:06.300
<v Speaker 2>what are the nature of your theories of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world?</v>

824
00:45:06.301 --> 00:45:07.134
<v Speaker 2>And that's where you get into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinction between motivational </v>

825
00:45:11.221 --> 00:45:13.800
<v Speaker 2>significance and value and material </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>

826
00:45:13.801 --> 00:45:18.300
<v Speaker 2>And I would say that you're the the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive structures that use,</v>

827
00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:19.193
<v Speaker 2>they're not just cognitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually your personality because </v>

828
00:45:23.791 --> 00:45:26.940
<v Speaker 2>the personality is far more than it than</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cognitive structure.</v>

829
00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:31.800
<v Speaker 2>Your personality is how you act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's how you act out ideas,</v>

830
00:45:31.801 --> 00:45:32.634
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually how you move your body through </v>

831
00:45:33.931 --> 00:45:34.764
<v Speaker 2>time and space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's how you perceive because you don't </v>

832
00:45:37.231 --> 00:45:38.064
<v Speaker 2>perceive everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You perceive a very limited subset of </v>

833
00:45:40.321 --> 00:45:41.154
<v Speaker 2>things and there are processes that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with your personality that </v>

834
00:45:44.071 --> 00:45:48.180
<v Speaker 2>determined what that subset is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It determines how you value things.</v>

835
00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:51.150
<v Speaker 2>It determines how you respond to them </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotionally.</v>

836
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:56.270
<v Speaker 2>And then it sets the boundaries for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>contents of your cognitive knowledge.</v>

837
00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:59.100
<v Speaker 2>So I would think of that as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality.</v>

838
00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:02.090
<v Speaker 2>And what's the personality up to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

839
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:04.020
<v Speaker 2>it's trying to orient itself in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

840
00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:05.363
<v Speaker 2>It's trying to figure out how to act in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world and I would say that's our </v>

841
00:46:10.051 --> 00:46:10.884
<v Speaker 2>fundamental problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our fundamental problem isn't what are </v>

842
00:46:14.071 --> 00:46:14.904
<v Speaker 2>things made of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although I'm not saying that's not a </v>

843
00:46:16.471 --> 00:46:17.730
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a problem,</v>

844
00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:18.803
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the fundamental problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fundamental problem is what to do </v>

845
00:46:23.101 --> 00:46:27.810
<v Speaker 2>about what things are made of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like where to go now and you know,</v>

846
00:46:27.811 --> 00:46:29.910
<v Speaker 2>that's an existentialist claim in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

847
00:46:29.911 --> 00:46:31.140
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

848
00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:35.160
<v Speaker 2>what's the meaning of your life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the purpose of your life?</v>

849
00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:36.383
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we shouldn't be using materialists </v>

850
00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:43.920
<v Speaker 2>theories to address such questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we do and it's cost us a lot.</v>

851
00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:45.630
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

852
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.863
<v Speaker 3>Really</v>

853
00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.670
<v Speaker 2>well that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what I want to talk about</v>

854
00:46:56.671 --> 00:46:58.170
<v Speaker 2>next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it a problem?</v>

855
00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:01.150
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Yup.</v>

856
00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:07.503
<v Speaker 3>System of values is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's somehow hijacked our motivational </v>

857
00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:16.550
<v Speaker 3>system without being connected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that sounds really.</v>

858
00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:20.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it couldn't be true.</v>

859
00:47:20.301 --> 00:47:23.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean if it turns out that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific endeavor dooms us,</v>

860
00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:28.070
<v Speaker 2>which it might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you could certainly make that case.</v>

861
00:47:28.310 --> 00:47:29.143
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to make it post hoc though </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you won't be able to because there </v>

862
00:47:31.181 --> 00:47:32.650
<v Speaker 2>won't be anybody around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

863
00:47:32.651 --> 00:47:35.980
<v Speaker 2>what is that like the idea that science </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a valuable enterprise is a,</v>

864
00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:37.810
<v Speaker 2>it's a theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

865
00:47:37.811 --> 00:47:39.490
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

866
00:47:39.491 --> 00:47:42.550
<v Speaker 2>it's 50 slash 50 and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if people,</v>

867
00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:44.420
<v Speaker 2>maybe not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

868
00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:47.080
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely room for dispute </v>
<v Speaker 2>dispute.</v>

869
00:47:47.081 --> 00:47:47.914
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we would see the massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>emergence of phenomena like the </v>

870
00:47:50.951 --> 00:47:51.784
<v Speaker 2>environmental movement if there wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the human psyche that was very </v>

871
00:47:55.631 --> 00:47:58.870
<v Speaker 2>much worried about untrammeled </v>
<v Speaker 2>technological progress.</v>

872
00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:01.720
<v Speaker 2>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like hey,</v>

873
00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:03.393
<v Speaker 2>we should also be equally worried about </v>
<v Speaker 2>not like no technological process </v>

874
00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:09.820
<v Speaker 2>progress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're basically screwed either way.</v>

875
00:48:09.821 --> 00:48:11.050
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

876
00:48:11.051 --> 00:48:13.690
<v Speaker 2>but that's in some sense beside the </v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

877
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:14.583
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the reason I got into the ideas that </v>

878
00:48:20.021 --> 00:48:23.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm describing to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite straightforward now.</v>

879
00:48:23.351 --> 00:48:24.130
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

880
00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:27.180
<v Speaker 2>I can't really use the story that I used</v>
<v Speaker 2>to use to,</v>

881
00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:32.340
<v Speaker 2>to frame why I'm telling you what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling you because when I develop these</v>

882
00:48:32.801 --> 00:48:35.620
<v Speaker 2>ideas and I'm been working on them for </v>
<v Speaker 2>30 years,</v>

883
00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:36.843
<v Speaker 2>my primary motivation was to understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>what insanity was driving the Cold War </v>

884
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000
<v Speaker 2>because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I started working on these things</v>

885
00:48:46.001 --> 00:48:46.834
<v Speaker 2>probably in about 1982,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I'd been thinking about things </v>

886
00:48:48.971 --> 00:48:53.971
<v Speaker 2>like that far longer than that and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know what it's like for you people</v>

887
00:48:53.981 --> 00:48:56.460
<v Speaker 2>as young people I know you're worried </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the environment and,</v>

888
00:48:56.770 --> 00:49:00.550
<v Speaker 2>but when I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>younger,</v>

889
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.780
<v Speaker 2>young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone I knew was very,</v>

890
00:49:04.781 --> 00:49:05.614
<v Speaker 2>very obsessed with the idea that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was likely going to be a thermonuclear </v>

891
00:49:08.891 --> 00:49:12.970
<v Speaker 2>war and we didn't assume that it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain,</v>

892
00:49:12.971 --> 00:49:16.360
<v Speaker 2>but we certainly assumed that it was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>high,</v>

893
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:18.240
<v Speaker 2>it was highly probable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

894
00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:20.050
<v Speaker 2>when things came pretty damn close.</v>

895
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:24.430
<v Speaker 2>So I'll tell you a story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one time,</v>

896
00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:29.020
<v Speaker 2>about 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to Arizona and,</v>

897
00:49:29.021 --> 00:49:32.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to see a Patriot missile site.</v>

898
00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:37.150
<v Speaker 2>And the Patriot missiles were the early </v>
<v Speaker 2>intercontinental ballistic missiles.</v>

899
00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:41.110
<v Speaker 2>Now a ballistic missile is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting entity because,</v>

900
00:49:41.111 --> 00:49:43.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think about something like a,</v>

901
00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:47.360
<v Speaker 2>what do they call those cruise missiles?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cruise missiles,</v>

902
00:49:47.361 --> 00:49:49.420
<v Speaker 2>it's like a robot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can tell that thing where to go,</v>

903
00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:50.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of,</v>

904
00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:51.093
<v Speaker 2>it's got enough intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you don't want it to land there </v>

905
00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:54.333
<v Speaker 2>and you've launched it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can have it land somewhere </v>

906
00:49:57.101 --> 00:49:57.934
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But an intercontinental ballistic </v>

907
00:49:58.661 --> 00:49:59.520
<v Speaker 2>missile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no,</v>

908
00:49:59.521 --> 00:50:00.280
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

909
00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:03.250
<v Speaker 2>it's a rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You point and you pull the trigger at 20</v>

910
00:50:03.251 --> 00:50:04.084
<v Speaker 2>minutes later that thing has blown up a </v>
<v Speaker 2>city and there's no calling it back and </v>

911
00:50:07.541 --> 00:50:09.850
<v Speaker 2>there was no diverting it and you know.</v>

912
00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:13.510
<v Speaker 2>So I went to the missile site and those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things were huge.</v>

913
00:50:13.511 --> 00:50:16.210
<v Speaker 2>They were like major rockets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The launch tube,</v>

914
00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:18.910
<v Speaker 2>because they were underground would have</v>
<v Speaker 2>been much,</v>

915
00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:23.140
<v Speaker 2>much broader in diameter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then this room,</v>

916
00:50:23.141 --> 00:50:27.830
<v Speaker 2>like it was a major league thing because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would zip up into space and land back</v>

917
00:50:27.831 --> 00:50:29.600
<v Speaker 2>on the other side of the world in 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

918
00:50:29.601 --> 00:50:32.990
<v Speaker 2>It's like those things are cruising </v>
<v Speaker 2>seven miles a second.</v>

919
00:50:32.991 --> 00:50:33.824
<v Speaker 2>They're moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when some of them had multiple </v>

920
00:50:35.901 --> 00:50:38.240
<v Speaker 2>warheads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they'd get over to the Soviet Union,</v>

921
00:50:38.241 --> 00:50:39.074
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they break apart into multiple </v>

922
00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:43.070
<v Speaker 2>nuclear warheads and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>

923
00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:45.530
<v Speaker 2>they were nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the forest in those things,</v>

924
00:50:45.531 --> 00:50:48.920
<v Speaker 2>there's still lots of them around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was made Hiroshima,</v>

925
00:50:48.921 --> 00:50:50.330
<v Speaker 2>looked like a pop gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

926
00:50:50.570 --> 00:50:51.980
<v Speaker 2>people built,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

927
00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:54.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you know this about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hydrogen bomb,</v>

928
00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.233
<v Speaker 2>so a hydrogen bomb has the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanisms that the son uses to produce </v>

929
00:51:00.231 --> 00:51:01.064
<v Speaker 2>heat.</v>

930
00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:03.740
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if your standard at Tomic bomb,</v>

931
00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:06.650
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's low grade in terms of evolution,</v>

932
00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:07.723
<v Speaker 2>in terms of energy transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hydrogen bomb is so powerful that it </v>

933
00:51:12.411 --> 00:51:16.360
<v Speaker 2>uses an atom bomb as it's trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you'd like.</v>

934
00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:18.950
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole new scale of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of destructive magnitude.</v>

935
00:51:18.951 --> 00:51:22.700
<v Speaker 2>And there was like at that point we'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>say 1982,</v>

936
00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:25.280
<v Speaker 2>there is tens of thousands of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

937
00:51:25.281 --> 00:51:27.010
<v Speaker 2>Twenty 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the Russian side,</v>

938
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:28.760
<v Speaker 2>maybe $50,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the American side.</v>

939
00:51:28.761 --> 00:51:29.594
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody had it pretty itchy trigger </v>

940
00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:32.450
<v Speaker 2>trigger finger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

941
00:51:32.451 --> 00:51:35.540
<v Speaker 2>Reagan was in power and he was in many </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways,</v>

942
00:51:35.541 --> 00:51:36.980
<v Speaker 2>right about the Soviets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

943
00:51:36.981 --> 00:51:40.610
<v Speaker 2>they were an evil empire but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he scared the hell out of them.</v>

944
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:45.410
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was touch and go and anyway,</v>

945
00:51:45.411 --> 00:51:46.244
<v Speaker 2>so we're back in this old missile base </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so roadside looking at it and </v>

946
00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:54.470
<v Speaker 2>there's a nose cone for one of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that sort of lay in there in the,</v>

947
00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:55.393
<v Speaker 2>in the desert.</v>

948
00:51:55.610 --> 00:51:56.443
<v Speaker 2>And so that was kind of an eerie thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was about this high and probably </v>

949
00:51:59.271 --> 00:52:03.380
<v Speaker 2>about 12 feet in diameter and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>made out of plastic about that thick.</v>

950
00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.840
<v Speaker 2>It was sort of variegated plastic a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit clearer.</v>

951
00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:06.913
<v Speaker 2>That was the thing that would melt off </v>
<v Speaker 2>when the missile reentered the </v>

952
00:52:09.291 --> 00:52:10.580
<v Speaker 2>atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was like,</v>

953
00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:11.743
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>

954
00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:13.663
<v Speaker 2>it was a weird artifact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't just stand beside that </v>

955
00:52:15.621 --> 00:52:18.740
<v Speaker 2>thing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think neutral thoughts.</v>

956
00:52:18.741 --> 00:52:19.491
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>

957
00:52:19.491 --> 00:52:21.110
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a wicked thing.</v>

958
00:52:21.111 --> 00:52:24.800
<v Speaker 2>So then we went underground and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>very bizarre.</v>

959
00:52:24.801 --> 00:52:25.634
<v Speaker 2>It was surreal because the first thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>we pass through was like this museum </v>

960
00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:31.423
<v Speaker 2>front because it was a museum and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of like your grandmother's nuclear </v>

961
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:38.630
<v Speaker 2>missile site because it was staffed by </v>
<v Speaker 2>volunteers,</v>

962
00:52:38.631 --> 00:52:39.464
<v Speaker 2>seniors and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a little guest book that you </v>

963
00:52:41.781 --> 00:52:42.230
<v Speaker 2>could sign.</v>

964
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:44.420
<v Speaker 2>It was sort of pine panels and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

965
00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:47.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>southern Americans are pretty hospitable</v>

966
00:52:47.331 --> 00:52:49.910
<v Speaker 2>so there are sort of happy to see you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was like,</v>

967
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:52.543
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like your grandmother's nuclear </v>

968
00:52:53.691 --> 00:52:55.580
<v Speaker 2>missiles silos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was bloody weird.</v>

969
00:52:55.581 --> 00:53:00.230
<v Speaker 2>And then all around the outside of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the walls of the museum,</v>

970
00:53:00.231 --> 00:53:03.200
<v Speaker 2>there were pictures of Reagan basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

971
00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:06.290
<v Speaker 2>interacting with various people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including people from the Soviet Union.</v>

972
00:53:06.291 --> 00:53:07.124
<v Speaker 2>So it was quite weird because it was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>time of war because there I was in like </v>

973
00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:13.970
<v Speaker 2>1982 and then in my grandmother's </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear missile silo.</v>

974
00:53:13.971 --> 00:53:16.820
<v Speaker 2>And then we went into the silo itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>which was quite deep underground.</v>

975
00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:17.683
<v Speaker 2>And so first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go through this massive door that </v>

976
00:53:20.031 --> 00:53:23.960
<v Speaker 2>looks like a safe door except the state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The safe is on steroids.</v>

977
00:53:23.961 --> 00:53:24.794
<v Speaker 2>It's like 12 feet high and this thick </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's made out of steel and it's </v>

978
00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:32.480
<v Speaker 2>painted that kind of pastel green that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody was really excited about 1957.</v>

979
00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:35.100
<v Speaker 2>And so the whole missile site is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

980
00:53:35.101 --> 00:53:35.934
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

981
00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:37.740
<v Speaker 2>here I am in like 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>

982
00:53:37.741 --> 00:53:38.574
<v Speaker 2>57 world destroying technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I moved from the say 2005 until the </v>

983
00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:49.050
<v Speaker 2>year 1982 and then I'm in 1957 and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like star trek down there,</v>

984
00:53:49.051 --> 00:53:50.310
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

985
00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:51.983
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

986
00:53:52.170 --> 00:53:55.380
<v Speaker 2>we go into the main control room after </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing the silo,</v>

987
00:53:55.381 --> 00:53:57.660
<v Speaker 2>which is now empty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We go into the main control room,</v>

988
00:53:57.661 --> 00:54:00.240
<v Speaker 2>I think it's 35 feet underground or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

989
00:54:00.241 --> 00:54:02.220
<v Speaker 2>which is basically far enough under </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>

990
00:54:02.221 --> 00:54:07.221
<v Speaker 2>So it would be protected from a nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 2>blast that wasn't a direct hit know dirt</v>

991
00:54:07.501 --> 00:54:10.500
<v Speaker 2>has a really good shield against </v>
<v Speaker 2>explosions as it turns out.</v>

992
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:12.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

993
00:54:12.421 --> 00:54:13.254
<v Speaker 2>so we're down there and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>control tables is over there and it </v>

994
00:54:15.691 --> 00:54:18.090
<v Speaker 2>looks like the Star Trek,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

995
00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.610
<v Speaker 2>control module,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except it's 1957.</v>

996
00:54:20.611 --> 00:54:22.440
<v Speaker 2>So everything switches and so forth.</v>

997
00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:25.630
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the technology is kind of rough and um,</v>

998
00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:26.633
<v Speaker 2>there's another control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's another control desk here and </v>

999
00:54:29.281 --> 00:54:29.821
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1000
00:54:29.821 --> 00:54:32.820
<v Speaker 2>would you like to go through a simulated</v>
<v Speaker 2>missile launch?</v>

1001
00:54:32.821 --> 00:54:36.090
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course that was definitely my idea of</v>

1002
00:54:36.091 --> 00:54:37.500
<v Speaker 2>a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1003
00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:40.380
<v Speaker 2>so they showed us what their protection </v>
<v Speaker 2>laws.</v>

1004
00:54:40.381 --> 00:54:41.214
<v Speaker 2>And so what happened was there's like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little place on that side and there's a </v>

1005
00:54:43.651 --> 00:54:44.484
<v Speaker 2>little place on that side and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>key and I believe that the people who </v>

1006
00:54:48.181 --> 00:54:49.890
<v Speaker 2>had the keys wore them around their </v>
<v Speaker 2>necks,</v>

1007
00:54:49.891 --> 00:54:51.900
<v Speaker 2>although that might not be right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they may have been stored,</v>

1008
00:54:51.901 --> 00:54:53.550
<v Speaker 2>but I think they wore them around their </v>
<v Speaker 2>necks.</v>

1009
00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:54.633
<v Speaker 2>Makes Sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1010
00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:58.230
<v Speaker 2>Because that's really high security.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in the key around your neck.</v>

1011
00:54:58.590 --> 00:55:01.050
<v Speaker 2>And so the deal was if you wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>launch a missile,</v>

1012
00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:02.063
<v Speaker 2>that person a was over there with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>key and person b was over there with </v>

1013
00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:08.850
<v Speaker 2>therapy because you needed two people to</v>
<v Speaker 2>launch the missile and then you both put</v>

1014
00:55:08.851 --> 00:55:09.684
<v Speaker 2>your keys in at the same time and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you turn them and you held them for 10 </v>

1015
00:55:12.781 --> 00:55:17.190
<v Speaker 2>seconds and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then bang,</v>

1016
00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.113
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1017
00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:21.030
<v Speaker 2>God only knows what happens next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then they said,</v>

1018
00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:24.390
<v Speaker 2>someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how close did you get?</v>

1019
00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:26.160
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1020
00:55:26.161 --> 00:55:31.161
<v Speaker 2>the keys were in the law at one point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they wouldn't tell us when,</v>

1021
00:55:31.441 --> 00:55:33.810
<v Speaker 2>but we knew when it was during the Cuban</v>
<v Speaker 2>missile crisis.</v>

1022
00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:35.603
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are other times where that </v>

1023
00:55:36.781 --> 00:55:38.580
<v Speaker 2>happened as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't the only time,</v>

1024
00:55:38.581 --> 00:55:40.980
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was good enough time.</v>

1025
00:55:40.981 --> 00:55:42.720
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1026
00:55:42.721 --> 00:55:44.790
<v Speaker 2>uh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

1027
00:55:44.791 --> 00:55:48.000
<v Speaker 2>so back when I was your age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>

1028
00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:49.493
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1029
00:55:49.590 --> 00:55:52.350
<v Speaker 2>the world was locked in this dispute and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was no joke,</v>

1030
00:55:52.351 --> 00:55:53.184
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1031
00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:54.683
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't that long since the Soviets </v>
<v Speaker 2>went into Czechoslovakia and it wasn't </v>

1032
00:55:56.881 --> 00:55:57.714
<v Speaker 2>that long since they went into Hungary </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was only 40 years after the </v>

1033
00:56:00.511 --> 00:56:03.360
<v Speaker 2>second world war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was tense.</v>

1034
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:06.570
<v Speaker 2>It was tense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And lots of people I knew,</v>

1035
00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:08.670
<v Speaker 2>maybe they've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1036
00:56:08.671 --> 00:56:11.820
<v Speaker 2>maybe it was just justification for </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own psychological nihilism,</v>

1037
00:56:11.821 --> 00:56:12.654
<v Speaker 2>but they had a hard time being concerned</v>
<v Speaker 2>about their futures because they really </v>

1038
00:56:15.391 --> 00:56:16.560
<v Speaker 2>didn't think they were going to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>any.</v>

1039
00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:20.610
<v Speaker 2>And so it was always a heavy Paul that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was over everyone's spirits.</v>

1040
00:56:20.611 --> 00:56:21.444
<v Speaker 2>And what it really didn't peak again in </v>
<v Speaker 2>about 1982 under Reagan and there was a </v>

1041
00:56:24.881 --> 00:56:29.050
<v Speaker 2>whole bunch of movies made at that time </v>
<v Speaker 2>about nuclear destruction,</v>

1042
00:56:29.051 --> 00:56:29.884
<v Speaker 2>including one called the day after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you may have watched or may not </v>

1043
00:56:32.291 --> 00:56:36.430
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more people watched that than any TV</v>

1044
00:56:36.431 --> 00:56:39.520
<v Speaker 2>movie ever made at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1045
00:56:39.521 --> 00:56:43.210
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty dismal man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like there's the city and Poof,</v>

1046
00:56:43.211 --> 00:56:46.510
<v Speaker 2>there's a nuclear bomb and everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 2>wandering around ruined.</v>

1047
00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:47.493
<v Speaker 2>And that was sort of the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Reagan actually said weirdly enough </v>

1048
00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:55.270
<v Speaker 2>that that movie actually motivated him </v>
<v Speaker 2>to enter into more negotiations with the</v>

1049
00:56:55.271 --> 00:56:56.470
<v Speaker 2>Soviet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1050
00:56:56.471 --> 00:56:57.304
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might have thought he would have </v>

1051
00:56:57.641 --> 00:56:59.830
<v Speaker 2>thought that through before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1052
00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:00.693
<v Speaker 2>he was an actor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I guess the movie was enough to </v>

1053
00:57:02.231 --> 00:57:03.064
<v Speaker 2>convince him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1054
00:57:03.730 --> 00:57:05.050
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so everyone was,</v>

1055
00:57:05.051 --> 00:57:05.884
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were carrying this around on our </v>

1056
00:57:06.851 --> 00:57:08.710
<v Speaker 2>backs in some sense.</v>

1057
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:12.970
<v Speaker 2>And I was obsessed by it for one reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>or another.</v>

1058
00:57:12.971 --> 00:57:17.860
<v Speaker 2>I had nuclear nightmares on a regular </v>
<v Speaker 2>basis and God only knows why that was.</v>

1059
00:57:17.861 --> 00:57:18.694
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows why you get obsessed with </v>

1060
00:57:19.751 --> 00:57:20.584
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1061
00:57:20.650 --> 00:57:21.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

1062
00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:22.053
<v Speaker 2>I'd already always been interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>belief systems and what they motivated </v>

1063
00:57:24.971 --> 00:57:26.710
<v Speaker 2>people to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I was really young,</v>

1064
00:57:26.711 --> 00:57:27.544
<v Speaker 2>I was 13,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had a dentist in our town way the </v>

1065
00:57:30.221 --> 00:57:32.950
<v Speaker 2>hell up in northern Alberta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he had a tattoo on his arm,</v>

1066
00:57:32.951 --> 00:57:34.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was,</v>

1067
00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:36.040
<v Speaker 2>maybe there were two Jewish people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>our town,</v>

1068
00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:38.650
<v Speaker 2>may never really even occurred to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he was Jewish.</v>

1069
00:57:38.651 --> 00:57:40.780
<v Speaker 2>So it's not a lot of Jewish people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alberta.</v>

1070
00:57:40.781 --> 00:57:42.260
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1071
00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:46.330
<v Speaker 2>that was Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was kinda curious about that in a sort</v>

1072
00:57:46.331 --> 00:57:48.370
<v Speaker 2>of small town sort of way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1073
00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:49.653
<v Speaker 2>I also did a project when I was in </v>
<v Speaker 2>junior high about the Holocaust and I </v>

1074
00:57:52.091 --> 00:57:53.540
<v Speaker 2>got pretty interested in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1075
00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:54.393
<v Speaker 2>and part of I was interested in why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why in the world would people do such </v>

1076
00:57:58.631 --> 00:57:59.464
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1077
00:58:00.250 --> 00:58:01.610
<v Speaker 2>protecting their belief systems.</v>

1078
00:58:01.610 --> 00:58:02.443
<v Speaker 2>So let's say that's the Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then they were committing these </v>

1079
00:58:04.421 --> 00:58:05.254
<v Speaker 2>atrocities that were just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are the worst things that human </v>

1080
00:58:08.801 --> 00:58:09.634
<v Speaker 2>beings could imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the right way to conceptualize </v>

1081
00:58:11.201 --> 00:58:11.780
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1082
00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:15.400
<v Speaker 2>you sit in a dark basement with spiders </v>
<v Speaker 2>on your head for two or three years,</v>

1083
00:58:15.401 --> 00:58:16.234
<v Speaker 2>dreaming up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>miserable things to do and then come up </v>

1084
00:58:18.071 --> 00:58:18.904
<v Speaker 2>with a most miserable thing you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly imagine and then multiply that </v>

1085
00:58:22.001 --> 00:58:25.540
<v Speaker 2>by 100 and have people do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's sort of what was happening in the</v>

1086
00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:26.673
<v Speaker 2>concentration camps and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there were places on earth during </v>

1087
00:58:29.981 --> 00:58:32.920
<v Speaker 2>the Second World War that were worse </v>
<v Speaker 2>than the concentration camps.</v>

1088
00:58:32.921 --> 00:58:35.260
<v Speaker 2>And if you want to read about those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can read about,</v>

1089
00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:36.393
<v Speaker 2>I think it's unit 52,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a Japanese medical experimental </v>

1090
00:58:38.831 --> 00:58:39.880
<v Speaker 2>unit who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1091
00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:43.180
<v Speaker 2>I would recommend that you don't read </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because you'll read things,</v>

1092
00:58:43.181 --> 00:58:44.890
<v Speaker 2>you'll never get them out of your mind.</v>

1093
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:47.230
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was,</v>

1094
00:58:47.231 --> 00:58:49.840
<v Speaker 2>I was very curious about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like what the hell?</v>

1095
00:58:49.841 --> 00:58:50.674
<v Speaker 2>Here we are arming ourselves to blow </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other up and maybe the whole </v>

1096
00:58:52.901 --> 00:58:55.510
<v Speaker 2>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seems somewhat counterproductive.</v>

1097
00:58:55.511 --> 00:58:56.344
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you're a communist or </v>

1098
00:58:57.250 --> 00:58:58.083
<v Speaker 2>capitalist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like being communist king of a </v>

1099
00:59:00.521 --> 00:59:03.730
<v Speaker 2>burned out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cinders seems to be a bad outcome,</v>

1100
00:59:03.731 --> 00:59:06.400
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're suffering from </v>
<v Speaker 2>radiation sickness and everyone,</v>

1101
00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:08.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his dad and you know,</v>

1102
00:59:08.021 --> 00:59:08.854
<v Speaker 2>you could say thing about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same thing about the capitalist end of </v>

1103
00:59:10.691 --> 00:59:12.550
<v Speaker 2>things and then I also was curious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1104
00:59:13.210 --> 00:59:16.660
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is this war of ideas occurring?</v>

1105
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:19.240
<v Speaker 2>And it burst out into real war is a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1106
00:59:19.810 --> 00:59:22.910
<v Speaker 2>Why is it occurring?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of it's still going on.</v>

1107
00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:24.073
<v Speaker 2>We're still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Americans are still at war with </v>

1108
00:59:25.101 --> 00:59:26.570
<v Speaker 2>North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1109
00:59:26.571 --> 00:59:27.404
<v Speaker 2>They never did sign a peace treaty and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the North Korean state that rather </v>

1110
00:59:29.811 --> 00:59:30.644
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>

1111
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:34.340
<v Speaker 2>So there was the issue of well what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell?</v>

1112
00:59:34.341 --> 00:59:35.174
<v Speaker 2>Why are we arming ourselves with these </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible weapons that are more than </v>

1113
00:59:38.421 --> 00:59:39.254
<v Speaker 2>sufficient to blow up our enemies </v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple times and would maybe take the </v>

1114
00:59:41.661 --> 00:59:43.880
<v Speaker 2>whole planet with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems rather insane.</v>

1115
00:59:44.090 --> 00:59:44.923
<v Speaker 2>And then the other issue was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we do have two belief systems </v>

1116
00:59:48.261 --> 00:59:49.250
<v Speaker 2>operating here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

1117
00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:50.750
<v Speaker 2>they're really not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1118
00:59:50.751 --> 00:59:55.580
<v Speaker 2>like the presuppositions of communism </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the presuppositions of the West,</v>

1119
00:59:55.581 --> 00:59:56.414
<v Speaker 2>we're not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were seriously different at the </v>

1120
00:59:58.911 --> 01:00:02.420
<v Speaker 2>level of like constitutional assumption </v>
<v Speaker 2>way down deep.</v>

1121
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:03.800
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1122
01:00:03.801 --> 01:00:04.634
<v Speaker 2>another question and emerged from that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was why a system at all and then how do </v>

1123
01:00:12.051 --> 01:00:15.680
<v Speaker 2>you determine the validity of one system</v>
<v Speaker 2>compared to another.</v>

1124
01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:17.540
<v Speaker 2>It's a big problem even now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1125
01:00:17.541 --> 01:00:19.850
<v Speaker 2>We have culture wars going on and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of ways,</v>

1126
01:00:19.851 --> 01:00:20.684
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>radical Islam against the West for </v>

1127
01:00:22.191 --> 01:00:23.024
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>

1128
01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:23.953
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there any way of sort of getting a </v>

1129
01:00:26.121 --> 01:00:30.920
<v Speaker 2>handle on what these systems are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what differences in the mean,</v>

1130
01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:31.993
<v Speaker 2>why they motivate people to do atrocious</v>
<v Speaker 2>things as well as defending their own </v>

1131
01:00:36.951 --> 01:00:37.701
<v Speaker 2>territory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

1132
01:00:37.701 --> 01:00:38.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1133
01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:42.320
<v Speaker 2>is an understandable thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so generally for me it was like,</v>

1134
01:00:42.350 --> 01:00:43.490
<v Speaker 2>what the Hell is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

1135
01:00:43.491 --> 01:00:47.270
<v Speaker 2>what is happening here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know,</v>

1136
01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:48.163
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to university and I want it </v>

1137
01:00:49.971 --> 01:00:51.950
<v Speaker 2>to continue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that was a pretty good problem.</v>

1138
01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:55.370
<v Speaker 2>And I studied political science and </v>
<v Speaker 2>English literature for,</v>

1139
01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.920
<v Speaker 2>for the first part of my university </v>
<v Speaker 2>career.</v>

1140
01:00:57.921 --> 01:01:01.970
<v Speaker 2>And then the political scientists kept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were basically Marxists as clueless</v>

1141
01:01:01.971 --> 01:01:04.100
<v Speaker 2>as you can possibly get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

1142
01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:05.213
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they basically propose that the reason </v>

1143
01:01:06.381 --> 01:01:09.200
<v Speaker 2>people engaged in social conflict was </v>
<v Speaker 2>for economic reasons.</v>

1144
01:01:09.201 --> 01:01:10.970
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's no answer.</v>

1145
01:01:10.971 --> 01:01:12.350
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1146
01:01:12.351 --> 01:01:15.590
<v Speaker 2>economic reasons that means people fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>about things they value.</v>

1147
01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:17.000
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1148
01:01:17.001 --> 01:01:18.920
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>self evident,</v>

1149
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:20.023
<v Speaker 2>but what's not self evident is why </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly do they value that things they </v>

1150
01:01:23.271 --> 01:01:24.620
<v Speaker 2>value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1151
01:01:24.621 --> 01:01:29.621
<v Speaker 2>because obviously people can live at </v>
<v Speaker 2>very different levels of material.</v>

1152
01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:32.180
<v Speaker 2>Plenty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1153
01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:35.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's people who live in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazon jungle and they basically have,</v>

1154
01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:36.613
<v Speaker 2>from our perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have nothing and they're living </v>

1155
01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:40.610
<v Speaker 2>away just perfectly fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's people you know,</v>

1156
01:01:40.611 --> 01:01:41.444
<v Speaker 2>in New York penthouses and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are capable of adapting to </v>

1157
01:01:46.011 --> 01:01:51.011
<v Speaker 2>situations where the variance in </v>
<v Speaker 2>economic wealth is insanely large.</v>

1158
01:01:52.011 --> 01:01:52.844
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea that we're fighting over</v>
<v Speaker 2>scarce resources or something like that </v>

1159
01:01:57.351 --> 01:02:00.260
<v Speaker 2>just struck me as stupid and I do think </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's stupid.</v>

1160
01:02:00.410 --> 01:02:03.380
<v Speaker 2>It's not even easy to define what </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitutes a resource.</v>

1161
01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:04.131
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1162
01:02:04.131 --> 01:02:05.660
<v Speaker 2>you might think about Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1163
01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:08.000
<v Speaker 2>It's got no resources at all and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>rich,</v>

1164
01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:09.033
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a bit stagnant at the moment </v>

1165
01:02:09.921 --> 01:02:12.380
<v Speaker 2>because it's aging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Japan has nothing.</v>

1166
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:15.470
<v Speaker 2>It has rice that they have to subsidize </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's rich as can be,</v>

1167
01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:16.753
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So none of that made any sense to me at </v>

1168
01:02:18.411 --> 01:02:19.244
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was just posturing and I </v>

1169
01:02:21.331 --> 01:02:24.150
<v Speaker 2>still think that I think it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous idea.</v>

1170
01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:26.010
<v Speaker 2>It's shallow is can be.</v>

1171
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:29.670
<v Speaker 2>So then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1172
01:02:29.690 --> 01:02:33.100
<v Speaker 2>I'll study psychology instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1173
01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:34.003
<v Speaker 2>and I did that partly because I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in problems at a clinical </v>

1174
01:02:36.451 --> 01:02:38.700
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was also,</v>

1175
01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:40.253
<v Speaker 2>I started reading some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took a psych course that was self </v>

1176
01:02:42.451 --> 01:02:45.390
<v Speaker 2>study and I started reading some real </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologists,</v>

1177
01:02:45.391 --> 01:02:46.081
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this,</v>

1178
01:02:46.081 --> 01:02:50.970
<v Speaker 2>in this self guided reading course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read original works by Carl Rogers and</v>

1179
01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:54.570
<v Speaker 2>Abraham maslow and I read the archetypes</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the collective unconscious by young.</v>

1180
01:02:54.571 --> 01:02:56.640
<v Speaker 2>And I read the interpretation of dreams </v>
<v Speaker 2>by Freud.</v>

1181
01:02:56.641 --> 01:03:01.200
<v Speaker 2>Like I was trying to pick out core texts</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the history of psychological ideas.</v>

1182
01:03:01.201 --> 01:03:03.090
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was really helpful.</v>

1183
01:03:03.091 --> 01:03:03.924
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing like reading original </v>

1184
01:03:05.131 --> 01:03:08.460
<v Speaker 2>works by geniuses to provide you with </v>
<v Speaker 2>some useful information,</v>

1185
01:03:08.461 --> 01:03:09.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is extraordinarily useful.</v>

1186
01:03:09.991 --> 01:03:11.640
<v Speaker 2>Reading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1187
01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:14.970
<v Speaker 2>and I was reading the chat the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

1188
01:03:14.971 --> 01:03:17.400
<v Speaker 2>which was also really remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I read,</v>

1189
01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:20.790
<v Speaker 2>I read most of what was published at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that point by niche.</v>

1190
01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:23.910
<v Speaker 2>And I tried to read it in chronological </v>
<v Speaker 2>order and it really blew me away.</v>

1191
01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:24.690
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mandy,</v>

1192
01:03:24.690 --> 01:03:27.360
<v Speaker 2>that guy don't know what was up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

1193
01:03:27.361 --> 01:03:29.250
<v Speaker 2>but he could sure think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1194
01:03:29.251 --> 01:03:34.200
<v Speaker 2>Nisha said at one point I write in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sentence what it takes other people,</v>

1195
01:03:34.201 --> 01:03:36.310
<v Speaker 2>a whole book to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1196
01:03:36.330 --> 01:03:39.690
<v Speaker 2>that's a pretty huge mystic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>narcissistic comment,</v>

1197
01:03:39.691 --> 01:03:40.511
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like.</v>

1198
01:03:40.511 --> 01:03:42.270
<v Speaker 2>And then he talks and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

1199
01:03:42.271 --> 01:03:45.450
<v Speaker 2>they can't even say it in a whole book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1200
01:03:45.451 --> 01:03:46.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1201
01:03:46.650 --> 01:03:48.690
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was right too.</v>

1202
01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.130
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was right,</v>

1203
01:03:50.131 --> 01:03:51.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and nature was not in very good health.</v>

1204
01:03:51.961 --> 01:03:52.794
<v Speaker 2>And so he'd think like mad and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>write something down that summarize the </v>

1205
01:03:55.981 --> 01:03:56.814
<v Speaker 2>thinking because he didn't have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy to run through the whole </v>

1206
01:03:58.051 --> 01:03:58.884
<v Speaker 2>arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he said he liked to philosophize </v>

1207
01:04:00.631 --> 01:04:03.120
<v Speaker 2>with a hammer and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1208
01:04:03.121 --> 01:04:05.380
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't had a client recently who,</v>

1209
01:04:05.381 --> 01:04:06.214
<v Speaker 2>who is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was raised as a Christian </v>

1210
01:04:07.231 --> 01:04:08.310
<v Speaker 2>fundamentalist state.</v>

1211
01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:09.533
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was kind of cocky intellectually and </v>

1212
01:04:11.671 --> 01:04:14.070
<v Speaker 2>he's not a stupid guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he thought that he would,</v>

1213
01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:15.293
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take on Nicha intellectually because he </v>

1214
01:04:16.651 --> 01:04:17.484
<v Speaker 2>knew about Nisha statement about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>death of God and so he read me each and </v>

1215
01:04:20.310 --> 01:04:22.680
<v Speaker 2>that was the end of his Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1216
01:04:22.690 --> 01:04:25.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's you to watch who you pick on,</v>

1217
01:04:25.141 --> 01:04:25.974
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's not a good guy to pick on </v>

1218
01:04:27.211 --> 01:04:30.570
<v Speaker 2>because he's a lot smarter than you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1219
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:33.990
<v Speaker 2>a lot smarter than almost everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was an amazing person.</v>

1220
01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:36.660
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I was reading Nietzsche and I was</v>

1221
01:04:36.661 --> 01:04:37.494
<v Speaker 2>reading Dostoevsky and I was reading </v>
<v Speaker 2>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn at the same time </v>

1222
01:04:40.261 --> 01:04:42.750
<v Speaker 2>and social units and wrote this book </v>
<v Speaker 2>called the Gulag Archipelago,</v>

1223
01:04:42.751 --> 01:04:45.480
<v Speaker 2>which is like the second volume of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

1224
01:04:45.481 --> 01:04:49.740
<v Speaker 2>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He memorized the book in Karnes in a,</v>

1225
01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:52.410
<v Speaker 2>in a prison camp in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the book is,</v>

1226
01:04:52.590 --> 01:04:53.423
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's 2,400</v>
<v Speaker 2>pages long and it's written in like </v>

1227
01:04:56.310 --> 01:04:57.300
<v Speaker 2>seven point type.</v>

1228
01:04:57.330 --> 01:04:58.163
<v Speaker 2>It's a major league book and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't have much pen and paper in </v>

1229
01:05:01.091 --> 01:05:02.760
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the gulag camps.</v>

1230
01:05:02.761 --> 01:05:03.594
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he spent a lot of time thinking </v>

1231
01:05:05.191 --> 01:05:06.024
<v Speaker 2>about why he was in there and why Russia</v>
<v Speaker 2>was basically the whole economy was </v>

1232
01:05:10.651 --> 01:05:13.620
<v Speaker 2>basically predicated on slave labor and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was absolutely murderous.</v>

1233
01:05:13.621 --> 01:05:15.870
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the second volume of that series,</v>

1234
01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:20.940
<v Speaker 2>he escaped from Russia in 1975.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was brought over in a bad translation</v>

1235
01:05:22.361 --> 01:05:24.220
<v Speaker 2>and circulated in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the west,</v>

1236
01:05:24.221 --> 01:05:26.950
<v Speaker 2>long before it was available in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell you,</v>

1237
01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:29.770
<v Speaker 2>once that book was published,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1975,</v>

1238
01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:30.873
<v Speaker 2>there was no being a Marxist anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he just demolished the claims of </v>

1239
01:05:35.201 --> 01:05:39.880
<v Speaker 2>the Marxist left to its moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>credibility,</v>

1240
01:05:39.970 --> 01:05:42.610
<v Speaker 2>just demolished it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And rightly so.</v>

1241
01:05:42.611 --> 01:05:44.860
<v Speaker 2>And it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an amazing book,</v>

1242
01:05:44.861 --> 01:05:46.630
<v Speaker 2>the Gulag Archipelago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>

1243
01:05:46.631 --> 01:05:48.070
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a Walkthrough,</v>

1244
01:05:48.071 --> 01:05:48.904
<v Speaker 2>a very deep swamp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a remarkable book because it's </v>

1245
01:05:53.081 --> 01:05:53.914
<v Speaker 2>like reading someone who's screaming and</v>
<v Speaker 2>outrage at the top of their lungs for </v>

1246
01:05:57.701 --> 01:05:59.500
<v Speaker 2>2,400</v>
<v Speaker 2>pages,</v>

1247
01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:00.873
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1248
01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:04.360
<v Speaker 2>So I was reading all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1249
01:06:04.361 --> 01:06:05.194
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was having these nightmares and I </v>

1250
01:06:06.611 --> 01:06:07.444
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was trying to figure out what the </v>

1251
01:06:09.221 --> 01:06:12.730
<v Speaker 2>hell it was about belief systems and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how things had gone.</v>

1252
01:06:12.731 --> 01:06:14.890
<v Speaker 2>So as strange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in the 20th century,</v>

1253
01:06:14.891 --> 01:06:15.724
<v Speaker 2>so now I was reading the chip at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>point and I read parts of thus spake </v>

1254
01:06:19.691 --> 01:06:20.524
<v Speaker 2>Zarathustra and which is not a book by </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nietzsche that anyone should read until </v>

1255
01:06:22.931 --> 01:06:23.764
<v Speaker 2>they read everything else he wrote </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's nothing like anything else </v>

1256
01:06:25.781 --> 01:06:26.614
<v Speaker 2>he wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this weird sort of old testament </v>

1257
01:06:28.421 --> 01:06:30.490
<v Speaker 2>like poetry and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1258
01:06:30.491 --> 01:06:33.340
<v Speaker 2>it's revelatory in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a very strange book,</v>

1259
01:06:33.341 --> 01:06:34.174
<v Speaker 2>but it's in that book were Nietzsche </v>
<v Speaker 2>announces the death of God and he has a </v>

1260
01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:38.494
<v Speaker 2>profit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sarah Oostra come down from a mountain </v>

1261
01:06:41.171 --> 01:06:44.260
<v Speaker 2>into a marketplace and tell everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>that God is dead,</v>

1262
01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:46.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he says,</v>

1263
01:06:47.110 --> 01:06:47.943
<v Speaker 2>God is dead and we have killed him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>where will we ever get enough water to </v>

1264
01:06:52.901 --> 01:06:53.734
<v Speaker 2>wash away the blood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the part of Nietzsche's quote </v>

1265
01:06:55.061 --> 01:06:56.620
<v Speaker 2>that no one ever refers to.</v>

1266
01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:57.850
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we,</v>

1267
01:06:57.870 --> 01:07:00.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like to think of niches statement</v>

1268
01:07:00.191 --> 01:07:03.160
<v Speaker 2>as triumphal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some sense God is dead.</v>

1269
01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:03.851
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1270
01:07:03.851 --> 01:07:06.670
<v Speaker 2>but Nisha knew what was coming because </v>
<v Speaker 2>back in the eighties,</v>

1271
01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:08.830
<v Speaker 2>eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was a real prophet.</v>

1272
01:07:08.831 --> 01:07:12.490
<v Speaker 2>This man like Dostoevsky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how they did this knee,</v>

1273
01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:13.450
<v Speaker 2>just sad in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1274
01:07:13.490 --> 01:07:16.690
<v Speaker 2>in his notebooks and will to power that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the concept.</v>

1275
01:07:16.750 --> 01:07:17.583
<v Speaker 2>There's two things that were going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen to the human race because of the </v>

1276
01:07:19.991 --> 01:07:20.824
<v Speaker 2>death of religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One was that people would become </v>

1277
01:07:22.871 --> 01:07:23.704
<v Speaker 2>nihilistic and the other was that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would become totalitarian and he said </v>

1278
01:07:27.791 --> 01:07:30.430
<v Speaker 2>that what would happen in Europe in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>next century,</v>

1279
01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:31.293
<v Speaker 2>so this is like 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 years before the 20th century </v>

1280
01:07:33.881 --> 01:07:36.940
<v Speaker 2>started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there would be hundreds of millions</v>

1281
01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:39.310
<v Speaker 2>of people dying as a consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict.</v>

1282
01:07:39.311 --> 01:07:40.144
<v Speaker 2>Basically between Communist </v>
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions in classic Western </v>

1283
01:07:42.221 --> 01:07:43.960
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1284
01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:48.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the wall fell in 1989,</v>

1285
01:07:48.490 --> 01:07:49.810
<v Speaker 2>no one predicted.</v>

1286
01:07:49.810 --> 01:07:53.170
<v Speaker 2>It was like everyone was left </v>
<v Speaker 2>dumbfounded by that event.</v>

1287
01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.033
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so predicting what's going to happen </v>

1288
01:07:55.271 --> 01:07:56.104
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow that's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Predicting what's going to happen in a </v>

1289
01:07:58.991 --> 01:08:02.050
<v Speaker 2>whole century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 years before it starts.</v>

1290
01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:04.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to think someone's tapped into a</v>

1291
01:08:04.811 --> 01:08:05.644
<v Speaker 2>very deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep underground vein to be able to do </v>

1292
01:08:08.561 --> 01:08:09.394
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he thought about it as a idiation </v>

1293
01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:13.560
<v Speaker 2>and necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like cars,</v>

1294
01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:17.870
<v Speaker 2>furniture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once the idea of God was killed,</v>

1295
01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:19.243
<v Speaker 2>he believed that the entire moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure that was predicated on that </v>

1296
01:08:21.651 --> 01:08:23.360
<v Speaker 2>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was its fundamental assumption,</v>

1297
01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:26.540
<v Speaker 2>would be shaken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shaken to its core because it's like the</v>

1298
01:08:26.541 --> 01:08:30.410
<v Speaker 2>foundation piece was knocked out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything would be up for grabs.</v>

1299
01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:34.820
<v Speaker 2>If that's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then what?</v>

1300
01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:37.093
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a theme that Dostoevsky explored </v>

1301
01:08:38.091 --> 01:08:38.924
<v Speaker 2>to continually was Dostoevsky who needs </v>
<v Speaker 2>you to read and even more than I </v>

1302
01:08:43.221 --> 01:08:44.750
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I found out recently,</v>

1303
01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:48.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm Dostoevsky's take on it was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1304
01:08:48.171 --> 01:08:51.830
<v Speaker 2>if there's no God than anything than you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can do anything you want.</v>

1305
01:08:52.250 --> 01:08:55.250
<v Speaker 2>Everything is permitted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no morality whatsoever and all.</v>

1306
01:08:55.251 --> 01:08:56.084
<v Speaker 2>There is an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also pointed this out to some degree </v>

1307
01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:01.010
<v Speaker 2>because Nisha said most people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>morality is cowardice.</v>

1308
01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:03.800
<v Speaker 2>He didn't say that morality was </v>
<v Speaker 2>cowardice.</v>

1309
01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:04.813
<v Speaker 2>He said that people cover up their </v>
<v Speaker 2>cowardice by pretending that they're </v>

1310
01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:11.270
<v Speaker 2>moral when they refuse to do things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're terrified of.</v>

1311
01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:15.950
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's a nasty little comment </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it happens to be true.</v>

1312
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:18.440
<v Speaker 2>So Dostoevsky as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the same time,</v>

1313
01:09:18.441 --> 01:09:23.441
<v Speaker 2>was exploring what might happen from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>political perspective.</v>

1314
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:27.800
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if his ideas about the death of God were</v>

1315
01:09:27.801 --> 01:09:28.634
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that everything would be permitted if </v>

1316
01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:33.200
<v Speaker 2>God was dead and he wrote a book called </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Devil's,</v>

1317
01:09:33.201 --> 01:09:35.510
<v Speaker 2>which are the possessed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I would also highly recommend,</v>

1318
01:09:35.511 --> 01:09:38.210
<v Speaker 2>especially if you read it with the Gulag</v>
<v Speaker 2>archipelago because they're like,</v>

1319
01:09:38.750 --> 01:09:40.910
<v Speaker 2>Dostoevsky predicts what's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

1320
01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:43.310
<v Speaker 2>And then Solzhenitsyn describes what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened in there.</v>

1321
01:09:43.310 --> 01:09:44.510
<v Speaker 2>The same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1322
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:48.290
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's rather staggering actually.</v>

1323
01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:51.710
<v Speaker 2>And especially because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're having.</v>

1324
01:09:51.750 --> 01:09:52.583
<v Speaker 2>There wasn't anything more powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>written in the 20th century than </v>

1325
01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:55.873
<v Speaker 2>Solzhenitsyn's books and there wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything written in the 19th century </v>

1326
01:09:58.191 --> 01:09:59.990
<v Speaker 2>that was more powerful than </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dostoyevsky's books.</v>

1327
01:09:59.991 --> 01:10:03.260
<v Speaker 2>So like that's a one two punch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1328
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:05.623
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so nature is prediction was that once </v>

1329
01:10:09.471 --> 01:10:12.230
<v Speaker 2>you pull the rug out from underneath the</v>
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

1330
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:13.303
<v Speaker 2>it might take a long time to fall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's going to fall because there's </v>

1331
01:10:16.341 --> 01:10:17.174
<v Speaker 2>no foundation left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the system was actually logically </v>

1332
01:10:19.581 --> 01:10:21.740
<v Speaker 2>coherent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you accepted the assumptions.</v>

1333
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:22.583
<v Speaker 2>The assumptions were while they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically Christian assumptions in our </v>

1334
01:10:24.771 --> 01:10:27.170
<v Speaker 2>Judeo Christian assumptions in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1335
01:10:27.171 --> 01:10:28.004
<v Speaker 2>and they were predicated on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious substructure and those </v>

1336
01:10:30.171 --> 01:10:31.004
<v Speaker 2>religious ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Though it wasn't as obvious in the late </v>

1337
01:10:33.051 --> 01:10:34.550
<v Speaker 2>$1,900</v>
<v Speaker 2>as it is now,</v>

1338
01:10:34.670 --> 01:10:37.930
<v Speaker 2>had an unbelievably ancient history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1339
01:10:37.931 --> 01:10:38.764
<v Speaker 2>a Christian ideas are derived from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jewish ideas and Jewish ideas are </v>

1340
01:10:40.881 --> 01:10:45.100
<v Speaker 2>predicated on Egyptian ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Egyptian ideas are based in Mesopotamian</v>

1341
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:47.990
<v Speaker 2>ideas and that's about as far as back as</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can go.</v>

1342
01:10:48.230 --> 01:10:49.063
<v Speaker 2>But then we know that there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>shamanistic traditions that are </v>

1343
01:10:50.721 --> 01:10:53.900
<v Speaker 2>basically religious instruction that go </v>
<v Speaker 2>back maybe 25,000</v>

1344
01:10:53.901 --> 01:10:55.020
<v Speaker 2>years and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1345
01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:57.830
<v Speaker 2>before that we don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know,</v>

1346
01:10:58.910 --> 01:10:59.743
<v Speaker 2>but there wasn't nothing before that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there were people like us </v>

1347
01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:06.620
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally for at least 150,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1348
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:07.783
<v Speaker 2>And then there were people who were more</v>
<v Speaker 2>or less like us for depends on how you </v>

1349
01:11:10.911 --> 01:11:11.744
<v Speaker 2>count.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We diverged from our chimp human </v>

1350
01:11:13.861 --> 01:11:14.694
<v Speaker 2>ancestor about 7 million years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So God only knows how deeply rooted </v>

1351
01:11:18.511 --> 01:11:20.100
<v Speaker 2>those ideas are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1352
01:11:20.101 --> 01:11:20.934
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rationalist critics like and we </v>

1353
01:11:22.411 --> 01:11:25.470
<v Speaker 2>still have the like darkens for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1354
01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:28.230
<v Speaker 2>they kind of think of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a religious system as a,</v>

1355
01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:31.610
<v Speaker 2>as a superstitious scientific theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1356
01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:36.660
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's exactly what people like.</v>

1357
01:11:36.661 --> 01:11:38.940
<v Speaker 2>Voltaire thought 300 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1358
01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:41.280
<v Speaker 2>and it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1359
01:11:41.281 --> 01:11:42.840
<v Speaker 2>I get their point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's stupid.</v>

1360
01:11:43.530 --> 01:11:44.730
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you like,</v>

1361
01:11:44.731 --> 01:11:45.930
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget about that.</v>

1362
01:11:45.931 --> 01:11:49.020
<v Speaker 2>That's like 1750,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1363
01:11:49.021 --> 01:11:52.530
<v Speaker 2>it's not 1750 anymore and we've got </v>
<v Speaker 2>different problems.</v>

1364
01:11:53.610 --> 01:11:56.910
<v Speaker 2>And the idea that religion is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>superstitious scientific theory,</v>

1365
01:11:56.911 --> 01:11:58.650
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a really stupid idea.</v>

1366
01:11:58.800 --> 01:11:59.633
<v Speaker 2>All that means is that you haven't read </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything about the psychology of </v>

1367
01:12:02.041 --> 01:12:04.740
<v Speaker 2>religion or about religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenology in general.</v>

1368
01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:09.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean anybody who has any grounding in </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroscience and who actually reads,</v>

1369
01:12:09.870 --> 01:12:10.830
<v Speaker 2>knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1370
01:12:10.831 --> 01:12:11.664
<v Speaker 2>that there are all sorts of neural </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomena that result in religious </v>

1371
01:12:14.611 --> 01:12:16.070
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

1372
01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:17.970
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get epilepsy,</v>

1373
01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:21.120
<v Speaker 2>there's a high probability that your </v>
<v Speaker 2>aura,</v>

1374
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:24.120
<v Speaker 2>which is the sense you have before the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1375
01:12:24.121 --> 01:12:26.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>epilepsy hits is a high probability that</v>

1376
01:12:26.851 --> 01:12:29.160
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious experience.</v>

1377
01:12:29.730 --> 01:12:31.710
<v Speaker 2>And it was for Dostoevsky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

1378
01:12:31.711 --> 01:12:35.370
<v Speaker 2>So what happened to Dostoevsky was that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was kind of a student radical,</v>

1379
01:12:35.610 --> 01:12:37.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>under the czars.</v>

1380
01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:41.640
<v Speaker 2>And they arrested him along with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other student radicals and threw them in</v>

1381
01:12:41.641 --> 01:12:44.590
<v Speaker 2>the prison in Moscow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was in Lubyanka and they kept</v>

1382
01:12:44.591 --> 01:12:46.530
<v Speaker 2>them there for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's kind of an aristocratic guy,</v>

1383
01:12:46.531 --> 01:12:50.370
<v Speaker 2>so he wasn't used to a hard living and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then before they let him go,</v>

1384
01:12:50.371 --> 01:12:51.204
<v Speaker 2>they woke him up at six in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 2>and took them out in the firing squad </v>

1385
01:12:54.330 --> 01:12:55.163
<v Speaker 2>yard and then they lined up all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who would do the shooting when a </v>

1386
01:12:59.011 --> 01:13:01.950
<v Speaker 2>firing squad and they shot them with </v>
<v Speaker 2>blanks,</v>

1387
01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:05.490
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't know they were blanks and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so that was a little hard on his nervous</v>

1388
01:13:05.491 --> 01:13:08.070
<v Speaker 2>system and so he developed epilepsy as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of that.</v>

1389
01:13:08.071 --> 01:13:08.904
<v Speaker 2>And one of the consequences of example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>epsy was that just before he had the </v>

1390
01:13:11.671 --> 01:13:15.750
<v Speaker 2>actual seizure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said that it appeared to him that his</v>

1391
01:13:15.751 --> 01:13:16.584
<v Speaker 2>knowledge of the structure of reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>was deepening and deepening and </v>

1392
01:13:19.111 --> 01:13:22.050
<v Speaker 2>deepening and deepening until it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely overwhelming.</v>

1393
01:13:22.050 --> 01:13:22.883
<v Speaker 2>He felt like he was on the verge of </v>
<v Speaker 2>discovering the secret of the universe </v>

1394
01:13:25.801 --> 01:13:26.634
<v Speaker 2>and then apparently the secret of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe was a little too big to fit </v>

1395
01:13:28.891 --> 01:13:30.930
<v Speaker 2>inside his head and he'd have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>epileptic seizure.</v>

1396
01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:32.213
<v Speaker 2>But it's very interesting because </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dostoevsky was kind of a hack novelist </v>

1397
01:13:35.401 --> 01:13:39.480
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before he underwent prison,</v>

1398
01:13:39.570 --> 01:13:40.403
<v Speaker 2>then he had the firing squad thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened and then he was sent to this </v>

1399
01:13:42.481 --> 01:13:47.010
<v Speaker 2>like horrible prison full of murderers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and rapists for for a long time.</v>

1400
01:13:47.011 --> 01:13:48.990
<v Speaker 2>And so when he came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't the same guy.</v>

1401
01:13:49.170 --> 01:13:52.560
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to say exactly how much the </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience has changed them and how much</v>

1402
01:13:52.561 --> 01:13:53.394
<v Speaker 2>the epilepsy changed in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But certainly there are depths of </v>

1403
01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.033
<v Speaker 2>representation in his writing that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think he could have reached </v>

1404
01:14:01.741 --> 01:14:05.340
<v Speaker 2>without the epilepsy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so religious experiences,</v>

1405
01:14:05.341 --> 01:14:07.650
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're hardwired into your brain and we</v>

1406
01:14:07.651 --> 01:14:10.110
<v Speaker 2>can elicit them with some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with some regularity.</v>

1407
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:11.303
<v Speaker 2>Now you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that means there are biological </v>

1408
01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:13.600
<v Speaker 2>side effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1409
01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:14.800
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah maybe.</v>

1410
01:14:14.890 --> 01:14:16.270
<v Speaker 2>And maybe not to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1411
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:19.383
<v Speaker 2>so you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the rationalist do </v>

1412
01:14:21.401 --> 01:14:22.480
<v Speaker 2>with that sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1413
01:14:22.481 --> 01:14:24.700
<v Speaker 2>maybe they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's an evolutionary spandrel.</v>

1414
01:14:24.701 --> 01:14:26.530
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really mean anything of any </v>
<v Speaker 2>importance.</v>

1415
01:14:26.531 --> 01:14:27.364
<v Speaker 2>It's like</v>

1416
01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:29.793
<v Speaker 2>the whole span two spandrel is Spandrel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is something that characterizes an </v>

1417
01:14:33.581 --> 01:14:36.250
<v Speaker 2>organism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it hadn't really evolved.</v>

1418
01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:39.610
<v Speaker 2>It just more or less happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't say that it has a function,</v>

1419
01:14:39.611 --> 01:14:41.650
<v Speaker 2>it's like a side effect of something </v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

1420
01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:42.783
<v Speaker 2>One of the great tricks of rationalist </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary thinkers is that they call </v>

1421
01:14:45.791 --> 01:14:46.624
<v Speaker 2>anything that a biological organism </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifests that they can't account for </v>

1422
01:14:49.721 --> 01:14:52.090
<v Speaker 2>rationally a spandrel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a real,</v>

1423
01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:54.790
<v Speaker 2>it's a real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a pathological trick.</v>

1424
01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:57.940
<v Speaker 2>And you certainly can't do that with </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like religious experience.</v>

1425
01:14:57.970 --> 01:15:02.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean you just have to be adult to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that I can give you an example.</v>

1426
01:15:02.621 --> 01:15:03.454
<v Speaker 2>So I'm obviously part of what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening and really just phenomenology </v>

1427
01:15:08.351 --> 01:15:12.580
<v Speaker 2>is dominance hierarchy perception gone </v>
<v Speaker 2>mad in a sense.</v>

1428
01:15:12.581 --> 01:15:13.414
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so imagine that there's a hierarchy of </v>

1429
01:15:16.331 --> 01:15:20.320
<v Speaker 2>people and that you're hardwired to </v>
<v Speaker 2>admire those at the top.</v>

1430
01:15:20.710 --> 01:15:21.850
<v Speaker 2>Well obviously right?</v>

1431
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:22.833
<v Speaker 2>I mean how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>What Percentage of magazine Sold </v>

1432
01:15:27.790 --> 01:15:30.010
<v Speaker 2>Disposer About Celebrity Culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like 50 percent.</v>

1433
01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:31.900
<v Speaker 2>So like primates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like us,</v>

1434
01:15:31.901 --> 01:15:35.020
<v Speaker 2>we like to gaze at high status primates </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you take,</v>

1435
01:15:35.021 --> 01:15:35.854
<v Speaker 2>I think they're vervets and you figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>out the vervet hierarchy and you show </v>

1436
01:15:39.101 --> 01:15:41.990
<v Speaker 2>low status vervets photographs of high </v>
<v Speaker 2>status for bits,</v>

1437
01:15:42.010 --> 01:15:43.720
<v Speaker 2>then they'll spend a lot of time looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>at them.</v>

1438
01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:44.973
<v Speaker 2>So part of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of what I'm trying to suggest here </v>

1439
01:15:49.601 --> 01:15:52.480
<v Speaker 2>is that part of what religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenology is,</v>

1440
01:15:52.810 --> 01:15:57.580
<v Speaker 2>is the inbuilt sense of awe that we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we gaze up the hierarchy and we see</v>

1441
01:15:57.581 --> 01:15:58.414
<v Speaker 2>what's at the top and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that long since we had </v>

1442
01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:01.573
<v Speaker 2>monarchies and in many societies you </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't even allowed to look at the </v>

1443
01:16:04.181 --> 01:16:05.220
<v Speaker 2>king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1444
01:16:05.230 --> 01:16:07.810
<v Speaker 2>that was certainly the case in Japan </v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

1445
01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:09.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1446
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:10.103
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the emperor would be surrounded by </v>

1447
01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:13.720
<v Speaker 2>shoguns shoguns I think that's right.</v>

1448
01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:14.853
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were authorized to kill anyone who </v>

1449
01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:17.913
<v Speaker 2>got line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just chopped them up with their </v>

1450
01:16:18.791 --> 01:16:22.720
<v Speaker 2>swords and any bit of being out of line </v>
<v Speaker 2>was enough.</v>

1451
01:16:23.290 --> 01:16:23.890
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1452
01:16:23.890 --> 01:16:25.870
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy is a very serious </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1453
01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:27.420
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1454
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:30.520
<v Speaker 2>it's hard for modern people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the aw,</v>

1455
01:16:30.850 --> 01:16:35.650
<v Speaker 2>that must have accompanied the </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience of being exposed to a monarch</v>

1456
01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:38.020
<v Speaker 2>in a society that was fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 2>monarchical.</v>

1457
01:16:38.021 --> 01:16:38.854
<v Speaker 2>But the Japanese believed like right up </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the second end of the Second World </v>

1458
01:16:41.710 --> 01:16:45.310
<v Speaker 2>War that their emperor was a Sun God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you think,</v>

1459
01:16:45.311 --> 01:16:46.660
<v Speaker 2>well that's pretty damn weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1460
01:16:46.661 --> 01:16:47.590
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

1461
01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:51.040
<v Speaker 2>It's the fact that we don't have sun </v>
<v Speaker 2>gods that's weird,</v>

1462
01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:53.470
<v Speaker 2>like that's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really old idea,</v>

1463
01:16:53.471 --> 01:16:54.304
<v Speaker 2>and the Japanese were just doing what </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtually every culture before them had </v>

1464
01:16:56.741 --> 01:16:58.960
<v Speaker 2>done that ever got anywhere with </v>
<v Speaker 2>organization,</v>

1465
01:16:59.790 --> 01:17:00.623
<v Speaker 2>and so there's one of the things about a</v>
<v Speaker 2>god is that a god is something like </v>

1466
01:17:04.631 --> 01:17:06.490
<v Speaker 2>what's at the top of the dominant </v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkey.</v>

1467
01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:08.140
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings are very,</v>

1468
01:17:08.141 --> 01:17:12.050
<v Speaker 2>very peculiar creatures and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>capable of high levels of abstraction.</v>

1469
01:17:12.051 --> 01:17:15.250
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to offer you a theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1470
01:17:15.251 --> 01:17:19.250
<v Speaker 2>And this is a lot of thinking compressed</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a very tiny sentence.</v>

1471
01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:22.490
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine a dominance hierarchy.</v>

1472
01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:23.803
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now imagine that there's a set of </v>

1473
01:17:26.421 --> 01:17:27.254
<v Speaker 2>qualities that makes it more probable </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you'll get to the top of a </v>

1474
01:17:30.861 --> 01:17:32.300
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1475
01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:33.950
<v Speaker 2>that's not that hard to imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1476
01:17:33.951 --> 01:17:34.880
<v Speaker 2>You might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1477
01:17:34.881 --> 01:17:35.714
<v Speaker 2>intelligence might have something to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that attractiveness might have </v>

1478
01:17:38.331 --> 01:17:42.950
<v Speaker 2>something to do with that power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know from studies of chimps,</v>

1479
01:17:42.970 --> 01:17:45.980
<v Speaker 2>and this is mostly done by friends to </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that you know,</v>

1480
01:17:45.981 --> 01:17:46.814
<v Speaker 2>because you might think of kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>prototypical caveman society that it's </v>

1481
01:17:50.031 --> 01:17:54.740
<v Speaker 2>like the caveman that looks most like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodybuilder who's the most dominant cave</v>

1482
01:17:54.741 --> 01:17:56.810
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so to speak,</v>

1483
01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:57.823
<v Speaker 2>but what do all found among the chimps </v>
<v Speaker 2>was that the chimp who is at the top of </v>

1484
01:18:01.371 --> 01:18:02.204
<v Speaker 2>the male dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who remained at the top relatively </v>

1485
01:18:06.021 --> 01:18:08.360
<v Speaker 2>stable so that he wasn't brutally </v>
<v Speaker 2>murdered,</v>

1486
01:18:08.361 --> 01:18:11.060
<v Speaker 2>say bye to chimps that were below him in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dominance hierarchy,</v>

1487
01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:14.240
<v Speaker 2>was actually kind of a good leader in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sense.</v>

1488
01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:17.300
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he got along well with females in the</v>

1489
01:18:17.301 --> 01:18:20.450
<v Speaker 2>troop and maybe even attended to their </v>
<v Speaker 2>children to some degree.</v>

1490
01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:23.360
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't a completely unpredictable</v>
<v Speaker 2>tyrant.</v>

1491
01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:26.180
<v Speaker 2>And if he was like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>

1492
01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:27.073
<v Speaker 2>a couple of male chimps would form a </v>
<v Speaker 2>coalition and when his back was turned </v>

1493
01:18:30.231 --> 01:18:32.210
<v Speaker 2>at any moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they'd rip them to pieces.</v>

1494
01:18:32.810 --> 01:18:34.070
<v Speaker 2>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's really.</v>

1495
01:18:34.071 --> 01:18:34.904
<v Speaker 2>It's phenomenally interesting because </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it suggests is that there's a </v>

1496
01:18:37.431 --> 01:18:38.264
<v Speaker 2>stable set of characteristics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively stable that are operative </v>

1497
01:18:41.391 --> 01:18:44.750
<v Speaker 2>within a dominance hierarchy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>propels you to the top and that and that</v>

1498
01:18:44.751 --> 01:18:47.810
<v Speaker 2>that's characteristic not only of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchies,</v>

1499
01:18:47.811 --> 01:18:52.490
<v Speaker 2>but it's also characteristic in a way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's analogous to even chimp dominance</v>

1500
01:18:52.491 --> 01:18:53.324
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can read Frans de Waal if you're </v>

1501
01:18:54.681 --> 01:18:55.514
<v Speaker 2>interested in that sort of thing is he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>written a lot of books about the </v>

1502
01:18:57.291 --> 01:19:00.680
<v Speaker 2>emergence of morality and in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in chimpanzees in particular,</v>

1503
01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:01.850
<v Speaker 2>it's very nice work.</v>

1504
01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:05.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's observing chimps that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically in a zoo in,</v>

1505
01:19:05.471 --> 01:19:06.400
<v Speaker 2>in Holland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

1506
01:19:06.401 --> 01:19:08.390
<v Speaker 2>you could make the case that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1507
01:19:08.391 --> 01:19:12.200
<v Speaker 2>there are a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not like wild chimps but whatever,</v>

1508
01:19:12.230 --> 01:19:13.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

1509
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:14.383
<v Speaker 2>They're not exactly like wild chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that invalidates his </v>

1510
01:19:18.051 --> 01:19:19.430
<v Speaker 2>research at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1511
01:19:19.431 --> 01:19:19.971
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1512
01:19:19.971 --> 01:19:22.610
<v Speaker 2>you can observe similar things in wild </v>
<v Speaker 2>chimps.</v>

1513
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:25.250
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's kind of an interesting idea,</v>

1514
01:19:25.251 --> 01:19:26.084
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a set of stable traits that </v>

1515
01:19:27.021 --> 01:19:30.140
<v Speaker 2>propels you towards the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of those would be indicators of</v>

1516
01:19:30.141 --> 01:19:32.930
<v Speaker 2>biological health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like symmetry and beauty,</v>

1517
01:19:33.170 --> 01:19:35.930
<v Speaker 2>and some of them would be well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what other characteristics?</v>

1518
01:19:35.931 --> 01:19:37.620
<v Speaker 2>The rest of the bloody truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinker,</v>

1519
01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:38.473
<v Speaker 2>admirable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because admirable is also a very </v>

1520
01:19:41.781 --> 01:19:43.130
<v Speaker 2>interesting phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1521
01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:46.550
<v Speaker 2>Because there are people you admire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

1522
01:19:46.551 --> 01:19:49.730
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are there people that you admire and</v>

1523
01:19:49.731 --> 01:19:51.080
<v Speaker 2>what does it mean to admire someone?</v>

1524
01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:52.273
<v Speaker 2>And what it means in some sense is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the effect they have on you is one of </v>

1525
01:19:55.581 --> 01:19:58.100
<v Speaker 2>wanting to imitate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1526
01:19:58.101 --> 01:19:59.660
<v Speaker 2>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of our knowledge,</v>

1527
01:19:59.661 --> 01:20:04.010
<v Speaker 2>a tremendous amount of our knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't propagated linguistically.</v>

1528
01:20:04.011 --> 01:20:08.250
<v Speaker 2>It's propagated through invitation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the probability that were imitating each</v>

1529
01:20:08.251 --> 01:20:11.490
<v Speaker 2>other before we develop language is </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely high.</v>

1530
01:20:11.491 --> 01:20:12.324
<v Speaker 2>And we're also one of the few animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the only animal that are really </v>

1531
01:20:16.441 --> 01:20:21.441
<v Speaker 2>capable of true invitation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a major league advance in terms</v>

1532
01:20:21.631 --> 01:20:22.464
<v Speaker 2>of the transformation of information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what it means is you can go out </v>

1533
01:20:25.171 --> 01:20:26.004
<v Speaker 2>there and half kill yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning how to do something and </v>

1534
01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:31.110
<v Speaker 2>stumbled back into the tribe and </v>
<v Speaker 2>recover.</v>

1535
01:20:31.111 --> 01:20:34.290
<v Speaker 2>And then I can just watch you and embody</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you did.</v>

1536
01:20:34.291 --> 01:20:35.124
<v Speaker 2>And poof,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got the damn information and you </v>

1537
01:20:36.361 --> 01:20:37.194
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have to expose myself to </v>

1538
01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:39.473
<v Speaker 2>dragons and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all sorts of other horrible things </v>

1539
01:20:41.761 --> 01:20:43.170
<v Speaker 2>that were out there in the unknown.</v>

1540
01:20:43.710 --> 01:20:44.330
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1541
01:20:44.330 --> 01:20:47.550
<v Speaker 2>we're imitating ourselves all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you admire someone,</v>

1542
01:20:47.970 --> 01:20:52.110
<v Speaker 2>what that does is hook up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hooks into your desire to imitate.</v>

1543
01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:56.670
<v Speaker 2>And that's also part of an like an </v>
<v Speaker 2>inbuilt intrinsic biological process.</v>

1544
01:20:56.850 --> 01:20:58.500
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now fine.</v>

1545
01:20:58.530 --> 01:21:01.050
<v Speaker 2>So here's what we're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy,</v>

1546
01:21:01.230 --> 01:21:05.340
<v Speaker 2>reason for getting to the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that produces admiration,</v>

1547
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:08.130
<v Speaker 2>partly because people want to be at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>top of a dominance hierarchy.</v>

1548
01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:10.200
<v Speaker 2>That's success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're,</v>

1549
01:21:10.201 --> 01:21:15.201
<v Speaker 2>we're wired to climb dominance </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies because the top of a dorm,</v>

1550
01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:17.280
<v Speaker 2>if you live at the top of the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy,</v>

1551
01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:20.250
<v Speaker 2>you live longer than you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you live at the bottom of a dominance</v>

1552
01:21:20.251 --> 01:21:21.084
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you factor out the effect of </v>

1553
01:21:23.701 --> 01:21:26.010
<v Speaker 2>relative income,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more,</v>

1554
01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:29.670
<v Speaker 2>it's less stressful at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have better resources at the top and</v>

1555
01:21:29.671 --> 01:21:32.310
<v Speaker 2>the top is a place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1556
01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:34.800
<v Speaker 2>Because it's been around for 400 million</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1557
01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:35.813
<v Speaker 2>It's a place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a conceptual place in a sense </v>

1558
01:21:38.221 --> 01:21:42.000
<v Speaker 2>or it's a place that's the emergent </v>
<v Speaker 2>property of social organization,</v>

1559
01:21:42.001 --> 01:21:44.730
<v Speaker 2>but it's a place and it's a place where </v>
<v Speaker 2>people want to go,</v>

1560
01:21:44.910 --> 01:21:46.650
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got a dominance hierarchy,</v>

1561
01:21:47.790 --> 01:21:49.650
<v Speaker 2>someone gets to the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you admire them.</v>

1562
01:21:49.890 --> 01:21:53.130
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's not exactly what human beings</v>

1563
01:21:53.131 --> 01:21:54.570
<v Speaker 2>are like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1564
01:21:54.571 --> 01:21:57.780
<v Speaker 2>there isn't one dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's hundreds of the bloody things.</v>

1565
01:21:57.810 --> 01:21:58.643
<v Speaker 2>Especially as society becomes complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a radically very a gated realm </v>

1566
01:22:04.831 --> 01:22:06.600
<v Speaker 2>of dominance hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1567
01:22:07.410 --> 01:22:10.740
<v Speaker 2>And so then you might ask yourself</v>

1568
01:22:14.210 --> 01:22:15.043
<v Speaker 2>across the set of dominance hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a set of properties that makes </v>

1569
01:22:19.611 --> 01:22:20.444
<v Speaker 2>people likely to get to the top?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the kind of question that </v>

1570
01:22:22.641 --> 01:22:25.880
<v Speaker 2>only a creature capable of abstraction </v>
<v Speaker 2>could ask or pause it.</v>

1571
01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:27.823
<v Speaker 2>And I would say that the figure that </v>
<v Speaker 2>represents the properties that produces </v>

1572
01:22:33.291 --> 01:22:34.124
<v Speaker 2>the highest probability of climbing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the top of the set of all dominance </v>

1573
01:22:38.841 --> 01:22:41.570
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies is a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cyanic figure.</v>

1574
01:22:42.230 --> 01:22:46.710
<v Speaker 2>That's what a messianic figure is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1575
01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:47.593
<v Speaker 2>and it's a kind of abstraction it says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of course obviously a messianic </v>

1576
01:22:50.401 --> 01:22:54.540
<v Speaker 2>figure is an ideal write clearly and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you might think,</v>

1577
01:22:54.541 --> 01:22:56.460
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an ideal in relationship to what?</v>

1578
01:22:57.210 --> 01:23:02.210
<v Speaker 2>Well the he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he generally is the perfect person.</v>

1579
01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:07.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would we come up with the concept of</v>

1580
01:23:07.031 --> 01:23:07.864
<v Speaker 2>what constitutes perfect?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about it as a biological category </v>

1581
01:23:11.170 --> 01:23:12.003
<v Speaker 2>where all there's hardly anything more </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect and the ability to climb to the </v>

1582
01:23:16.431 --> 01:23:19.130
<v Speaker 2>top of whatever dominance hierarchy you </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to be put in.</v>

1583
01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:20.143
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I would say is that </v>

1584
01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.943
<v Speaker 2>women exerted tremendous selection </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure on men to be exactly that sort </v>

1585
01:23:26.301 --> 01:23:28.030
<v Speaker 2>of creature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1586
01:23:28.031 --> 01:23:28.864
<v Speaker 2>and I can tell you a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>experimental evidence that we have in </v>

1587
01:23:31.101 --> 01:23:31.934
<v Speaker 2>relationship shipped to that later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fortunately it was an unpublished study </v>

1588
01:23:34.341 --> 01:23:36.210
<v Speaker 2>because it was an undergraduate thesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1589
01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:41.800
<v Speaker 2>but what the hell else would women </v>
<v Speaker 2>select men for?</v>

1590
01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:44.630
<v Speaker 2>They had any sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1591
01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:46.510
<v Speaker 2>You want to select a partner because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1592
01:23:46.511 --> 01:23:48.190
<v Speaker 2>you've heard the idea of hyper gummy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1593
01:23:48.191 --> 01:23:51.070
<v Speaker 2>Women made across or up dominance </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies.</v>

1594
01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:52.293
<v Speaker 2>And so people think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well women are after say something like </v>

1595
01:23:54.551 --> 01:23:55.384
<v Speaker 2>wealth and success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we tested that women aren't that </v>

1596
01:23:58.361 --> 01:24:01.300
<v Speaker 2>stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what we did was this,</v>

1597
01:24:01.301 --> 01:24:06.301
<v Speaker 2>so we showed a bunch of women the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>picture of a guy,</v>

1598
01:24:07.330 --> 01:24:12.330
<v Speaker 2>but we attached for stories to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One story was the basic two by two cross</v>

1599
01:24:14.171 --> 01:24:18.100
<v Speaker 2>was useful versus useless and poor </v>
<v Speaker 2>versus rich.</v>

1600
01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:20.260
<v Speaker 2>So we had useless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor,</v>

1601
01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:21.460
<v Speaker 2>useful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rich,</v>

1602
01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:24.610
<v Speaker 2>useless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rich and useful,</v>

1603
01:24:24.611 --> 01:24:26.680
<v Speaker 2>poor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so here were the story.</v>

1604
01:24:26.681 --> 01:24:28.660
<v Speaker 2>So the useless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor guy.</v>

1605
01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:29.583
<v Speaker 2>Well you don't need a story for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like everybody can figure out what </v>

1606
01:24:31.061 --> 01:24:32.230
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1607
01:24:32.350 --> 01:24:35.110
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have anything and he's never </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get anything so fine,</v>

1608
01:24:35.111 --> 01:24:36.430
<v Speaker 2>useless and poor.</v>

1609
01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:39.220
<v Speaker 2>Then there's useless and rich.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a harder one,</v>

1610
01:24:39.221 --> 01:24:40.054
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what we did was the guy had won a </v>

1611
01:24:41.471 --> 01:24:46.060
<v Speaker 2>lottery that paid out weekly for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of his life.</v>

1612
01:24:46.061 --> 01:24:49.210
<v Speaker 2>So he couldn't squander the money </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it only came in weekly.</v>

1613
01:24:49.211 --> 01:24:50.044
<v Speaker 2>So there was always going to be money </v>
<v Speaker 2>around and we made the amount </v>

1614
01:24:52.390 --> 01:24:54.460
<v Speaker 2>sufficiently substantial so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1615
01:24:54.490 --> 01:24:56.260
<v Speaker 2>he was in the top one percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

1616
01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:58.630
<v Speaker 2>So that's useless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rich and useful.</v>

1617
01:24:58.631 --> 01:24:59.464
<v Speaker 2>Poor was this guy that he worked for an </v>
<v Speaker 2>NGO and like he was a good guy and you </v>

1618
01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:04.960
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's helping people out,</v>

1619
01:25:04.961 --> 01:25:06.850
<v Speaker 2>but he was never really gonna make any </v>
<v Speaker 2>money doing this.</v>

1620
01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:11.440
<v Speaker 2>He was Sorta altruistically committed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a benevolent cause,</v>

1621
01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:12.520
<v Speaker 2>useful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor.</v>

1622
01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:14.410
<v Speaker 2>And then there was useful rich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1623
01:25:14.411 --> 01:25:15.244
<v Speaker 2>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1624
01:25:15.790 --> 01:25:16.623
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of the useful rich guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like the hero of every two bit </v>

1625
01:25:20.771 --> 01:25:21.604
<v Speaker 2>romance and if you don't believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you could read a billion wicked </v>

1626
01:25:25.601 --> 01:25:26.434
<v Speaker 2>thoughts.</v>

1627
01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:27.333
<v Speaker 2>It's quite a cool book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's written by Google analytics guys </v>

1628
01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:30.273
<v Speaker 2>and they were looking for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>architectural structure of the sort of </v>

1629
01:25:32.441 --> 01:25:35.290
<v Speaker 2>literature that women read on in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>spare time,</v>

1630
01:25:35.291 --> 01:25:36.310
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the web.</v>

1631
01:25:36.311 --> 01:25:38.380
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of like the female equivalent </v>
<v Speaker 2>of pornography.</v>

1632
01:25:38.890 --> 01:25:42.310
<v Speaker 2>And so the main guys in these stories or</v>
<v Speaker 2>surgeon,</v>

1633
01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:47.050
<v Speaker 2>that's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Billionaire Pirate Vampire Werewolf.</v>

1634
01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:49.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's very funny.</v>

1635
01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:51.093
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what we found was we had women raped </v>

1636
01:25:53.381 --> 01:25:54.760
<v Speaker 2>the guys for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1637
01:25:54.761 --> 01:25:57.250
<v Speaker 2>would you date this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1638
01:25:57.490 --> 01:25:58.870
<v Speaker 2>go out for coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you date him?</v>

1639
01:25:58.871 --> 01:25:59.704
<v Speaker 2>Would you consider a long term?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you consider a longterm </v>

1640
01:26:01.870 --> 01:26:02.703
<v Speaker 2>relationship?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the result was wealth was </v>

1641
01:26:05.991 --> 01:26:08.720
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>useful was relevant,</v>

1642
01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:12.190
<v Speaker 2>so the useful poor guy was just as good </v>
<v Speaker 2>as the useful rich guy and that,</v>

1643
01:26:12.230 --> 01:26:13.063
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's smart because what you should </v>

1644
01:26:14.901 --> 01:26:19.901
<v Speaker 2>select for isn't having stuff now that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>because maybe this stuff will go away.</v>

1645
01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:21.793
<v Speaker 2>And that was especially true in </v>
<v Speaker 2>societies where stuff couldn't be </v>

1646
01:26:23.961 --> 01:26:24.794
<v Speaker 2>stored,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was almost every society we ever </v>

1647
01:26:26.511 --> 01:26:31.400
<v Speaker 2>had until the modern times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you select for is the capability</v>

1648
01:26:31.401 --> 01:26:34.760
<v Speaker 2>of being successful across multiple </v>
<v Speaker 2>environments,</v>

1649
01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:38.060
<v Speaker 2>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1650
01:26:38.061 --> 01:26:38.894
<v Speaker 2>So that's very much like the capability </v>
<v Speaker 2>of climbing to the dominance hierarchy </v>

1651
01:26:42.171 --> 01:26:44.930
<v Speaker 2>across sets of dominance hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1652
01:26:44.931 --> 01:26:47.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to you about a little bit and I</v>

1653
01:26:47.031 --> 01:26:50.750
<v Speaker 2>suggested that it's not so obvious what </v>
<v Speaker 2>would put someone at the top.</v>

1654
01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:52.340
<v Speaker 2>So leadership qualities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1655
01:26:52.350 --> 01:26:54.500
<v Speaker 2>because you can think about it as blunt </v>
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>

1656
01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:57.770
<v Speaker 2>sort of like psychopathic leader,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1657
01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:02.330
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty pessimistic and it could </v>
<v Speaker 2>easily be that a leader who can maintain</v>

1658
01:27:02.331 --> 01:27:03.164
<v Speaker 2>power for any amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in some sense isn't going to be </v>

1659
01:27:06.231 --> 01:27:11.231
<v Speaker 2>thrown over by violent revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has to be a leader of a certain type.</v>

1660
01:27:13.070 --> 01:27:14.930
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stable across,</v>

1661
01:27:15.020 --> 01:27:16.820
<v Speaker 2>let's say it's stable across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>islands,</v>

1662
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.710
<v Speaker 2>or we could even say maybe it's stable </v>
<v Speaker 2>across millions of years in very complex</v>

1663
01:27:21.711 --> 01:27:22.730
<v Speaker 2>social organisms.</v>

1664
01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:24.013
<v Speaker 2>It's a possibility because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partly what I've been trying to get it </v>

1665
01:27:26.331 --> 01:27:28.520
<v Speaker 2>as the biological basis of religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>belief.</v>

1666
01:27:28.521 --> 01:27:29.354
<v Speaker 2>And I would like to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to reduce religious </v>

1667
01:27:32.241 --> 01:27:33.074
<v Speaker 2>belief to anything because it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like Daniel Dennett wrote a book </v>

1668
01:27:37.521 --> 01:27:38.354
<v Speaker 2>called consciousness explained and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>critics said consciousness explained a </v>

1669
01:27:42.830 --> 01:27:44.360
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1670
01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:46.520
<v Speaker 2>so and I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1671
01:27:46.521 --> 01:27:48.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to explain religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenology,</v>

1672
01:27:48.531 --> 01:27:52.550
<v Speaker 2>but I am not trying to explain it a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to reduce it to something</v>

1673
01:27:52.551 --> 01:27:53.384
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to account for its </v>

1674
01:27:54.771 --> 01:27:56.930
<v Speaker 2>relationship with evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>

1675
01:27:57.050 --> 01:27:57.883
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is also why I think the modern </v>

1676
01:27:59.361 --> 01:28:00.920
<v Speaker 2>atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a damn clueless.</v>

1677
01:28:00.921 --> 01:28:05.030
<v Speaker 2>It's like religion is a human universal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1678
01:28:05.031 --> 01:28:09.020
<v Speaker 2>There's lots of human universals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Decoration is one everywhere.</v>

1679
01:28:09.021 --> 01:28:11.720
<v Speaker 2>People decorate themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clothing seems to be another.</v>

1680
01:28:11.721 --> 01:28:13.310
<v Speaker 2>Roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1681
01:28:13.370 --> 01:28:17.210
<v Speaker 2>some form of marriage seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>another language seems to be another.</v>

1682
01:28:17.450 --> 01:28:19.730
<v Speaker 2>Sharing food seems to be another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1683
01:28:19.850 --> 01:28:20.683
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're human and human beings have </v>

1684
01:28:22.521 --> 01:28:27.521
<v Speaker 2>characteristics like other animals have </v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristics and religious experience</v>

1685
01:28:28.371 --> 01:28:31.250
<v Speaker 2>and belief of some form is also a human </v>
<v Speaker 2>universal.</v>

1686
01:28:31.251 --> 01:28:31.971
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1687
01:28:31.971 --> 01:28:34.580
<v Speaker 2>it's something you have to contend with </v>
<v Speaker 2>from an evolutionary perspective.</v>

1688
01:28:34.581 --> 01:28:36.350
<v Speaker 2>You can't just brush it off and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1689
01:28:36.351 --> 01:28:38.230
<v Speaker 2>it's like superstitious science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1690
01:28:38.570 --> 01:28:39.403
<v Speaker 2>that's not an analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like human beings that religious </v>

1691
01:28:41.691 --> 01:28:44.090
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what the hell does that mean?</v>

1692
01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:44.953
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we bury our dead with ceremonies and </v>

1693
01:28:46.191 --> 01:28:48.410
<v Speaker 2>we'd been doing that for tens of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years.</v>

1694
01:28:49.010 --> 01:28:49.843
<v Speaker 2>So it's in us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And no one came up with these theories </v>

1695
01:28:52.911 --> 01:28:54.740
<v Speaker 2>because that's what the Marxists used to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say it,</v>

1696
01:28:54.741 --> 01:28:55.311
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

1697
01:28:55.311 --> 01:28:57.770
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion is the opiate of the masses.</v>

1698
01:28:58.100 --> 01:28:59.020
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1699
01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:02.640
<v Speaker 2>add Marxism was the math,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the math is massive,</v>

1700
01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:05.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we know where that went.</v>

1701
01:29:05.490 --> 01:29:07.350
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Marx's idea,</v>

1702
01:29:07.351 --> 01:29:08.184
<v Speaker 2>and this is the same idea that the post </v>
<v Speaker 2>structuralists and the postmodernist </v>

1703
01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:13.100
<v Speaker 2>bandy about is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1704
01:29:13.110 --> 01:29:13.943
<v Speaker 2>religion is some sort of semi calculated</v>
<v Speaker 2>expression of the power elite and the </v>

1705
01:29:18.331 --> 01:29:19.164
<v Speaker 2>purpose of it is to subordinate those </v>
<v Speaker 2>who were subordinate and to keep those </v>

1706
01:29:22.441 --> 01:29:24.360
<v Speaker 2>who were in power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in power across time.</v>

1707
01:29:24.361 --> 01:29:28.710
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's a conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody invented Christianity.</v>

1708
01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:30.060
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1709
01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:30.750
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1710
01:29:30.750 --> 01:29:31.583
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took 2000 years to reach its current </v>

1711
01:29:34.081 --> 01:29:34.914
<v Speaker 2>form and it was based on ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are tens of thousands of years </v>

1712
01:29:37.441 --> 01:29:40.080
<v Speaker 2>older than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So nobody was sitting around thinking,</v>

1713
01:29:40.230 --> 01:29:41.063
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's whip up a system to oppress the </v>

1714
01:29:42.301 --> 01:29:43.680
<v Speaker 2>masses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>

1715
01:29:43.681 --> 01:29:45.900
<v Speaker 2>even if you did come up with a theory </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

1716
01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:48.600
<v Speaker 2>how in the world are you going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to buy into it?</v>

1717
01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:50.423
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that easy to start a mass </v>

1718
01:29:51.541 --> 01:29:54.730
<v Speaker 2>movement and I think there's a 2 billion</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christians,</v>

1719
01:29:54.731 --> 01:29:55.564
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you get all those people to be </v>

1720
01:29:58.711 --> 01:30:01.230
<v Speaker 2>thinking that this is a good idea?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not easy.</v>

1721
01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:12.600
<v Speaker 2>Would I say say again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That superstition?</v>

1722
01:30:12.860 --> 01:30:15.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it created to control.</v>

1723
01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:17.340
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1724
01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:18.233
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean superstition is what you have </v>

1725
01:30:19.621 --> 01:30:21.810
<v Speaker 2>when you don't know what the hell you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about fundamentally.</v>

1726
01:30:21.811 --> 01:30:24.630
<v Speaker 2>Although I wouldn't put it down that </v>
<v Speaker 2>much because you know,</v>

1727
01:30:24.631 --> 01:30:28.170
<v Speaker 2>often superstitions are like functional </v>
<v Speaker 2>theories,</v>

1728
01:30:28.460 --> 01:30:29.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're.</v>

1729
01:30:30.050 --> 01:30:30.883
<v Speaker 2>And in theories have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of different ways that a </v>

1730
01:30:32.851 --> 01:30:34.710
<v Speaker 2>theory can be valid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1731
01:30:34.711 --> 01:30:35.544
<v Speaker 2>we talked about functional utility as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well and some things that look like </v>

1732
01:30:38.221 --> 01:30:40.230
<v Speaker 2>they're superstitious have functional </v>
<v Speaker 2>utility.</v>

1733
01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:43.770
<v Speaker 2>They're approximations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one thing to think about a theory is</v>

1734
01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:48.540
<v Speaker 2>I think of theories as tools and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a pragmatic perspective.</v>

1735
01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:51.510
<v Speaker 2>So I would think of scientists science </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a tool.</v>

1736
01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:56.040
<v Speaker 2>I think religion is a tool as well and </v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody would complain if they had a tool</v>

1737
01:30:56.041 --> 01:30:58.500
<v Speaker 2>box full of different tools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1738
01:30:58.680 --> 01:30:59.513
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can chop down a tree with a </v>

1739
01:31:01.231 --> 01:31:04.590
<v Speaker 2>hammer if you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it would be better to use an ax,</v>

1740
01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:07.260
<v Speaker 2>but a hammer beats the hell out of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>stick.</v>

1741
01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:08.700
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1742
01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:09.533
<v Speaker 2>my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that even a bad theory can be a </v>

1743
01:31:13.201 --> 01:31:14.034
<v Speaker 2>better tool than the one you had before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like approximations to the perfect </v>

1744
01:31:18.061 --> 01:31:18.894
<v Speaker 2>tool in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think your thinking is going to be </v>

1745
01:31:21.001 --> 01:31:22.200
<v Speaker 2>a hell of a lot easier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1746
01:31:22.201 --> 01:31:23.034
<v Speaker 2>all things considered if you start to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about theories as tools and to </v>

1747
01:31:26.131 --> 01:31:26.964
<v Speaker 2>also think about the theory as a tool </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has a limited domain of </v>

1748
01:31:30.481 --> 01:31:34.440
<v Speaker 2>applicability and that is a pragmatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea and I really think,</v>

1749
01:31:35.370 --> 01:31:37.170
<v Speaker 2>I really think the pragmatists were </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1750
01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:38.460
<v Speaker 2>I think they got it right.</v>

1751
01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:43.730
<v Speaker 3>Religion is a universal human </v>
<v Speaker 3>characteristic.</v>

1752
01:31:43.770 --> 01:31:44.960
<v Speaker 3>So many people that</v>

1753
01:31:48.250 --> 01:31:51.760
<v Speaker 2>no there aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just think about how many vegans do</v>

1754
01:31:51.761 --> 01:31:54.040
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1755
01:31:54.260 --> 01:31:55.093
<v Speaker 2>they're clueless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're clueless religious because what </v>

1756
01:31:56.771 --> 01:31:59.040
<v Speaker 2>they have is ritual without,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without,</v>

1757
01:31:59.530 --> 01:32:01.690
<v Speaker 2>without philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally.</v>

1758
01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:02.733
<v Speaker 2>So what's happened in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in many cases is that as the </v>

1759
01:32:04.691 --> 01:32:08.200
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated religion so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have collapsed.</v>

1760
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:09.303
<v Speaker 2>What emerges from their ashes are </v>
<v Speaker 2>rituals and rituals are sort of the </v>

1761
01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:14.980
<v Speaker 2>ground out of which are religion </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerges.</v>

1762
01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:17.050
<v Speaker 2>Vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetarianism,</v>

1763
01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:19.480
<v Speaker 2>Vegetarians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>environmentalist's.</v>

1764
01:32:19.690 --> 01:32:22.060
<v Speaker 2>Anybody who's in India log,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1765
01:32:22.061 --> 01:32:23.200
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason,</v>

1766
01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:28.420
<v Speaker 2>the reason that I would consider those </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the religious domain is because their</v>

1767
01:32:28.450 --> 01:32:33.450
<v Speaker 2>systems of value and they're predicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>on fundamental assumptions that you have</v>

1768
01:32:34.601 --> 01:32:36.250
<v Speaker 2>to take on faith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1769
01:32:36.251 --> 01:32:37.084
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing that's so peculiar </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it really turns out that if </v>

1770
01:32:40.181 --> 01:32:45.181
<v Speaker 2>you're going to act and you have to act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to make assumptions.</v>

1771
01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.190
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell.</v>

1772
01:32:47.210 --> 01:32:48.043
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to put your ignorance somewhere </v>

1773
01:32:50.830 --> 01:32:51.663
<v Speaker 2>and people put their ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They box it up inside their assumptions </v>

1774
01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:58.500
<v Speaker 2>and those assumptions very so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you know,</v>

1775
01:32:58.630 --> 01:33:03.370
<v Speaker 2>the other thing is you got to ask </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>

1776
01:33:03.371 --> 01:33:05.290
<v Speaker 2>when you're wondering if someone is </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious,</v>

1777
01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:06.753
<v Speaker 2>what you use as a marker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the typical marker would be I give </v>

1778
01:33:10.631 --> 01:33:13.600
<v Speaker 2>you a questionnaire and I asked you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you religious or do you go to church</v>

1779
01:33:13.601 --> 01:33:14.434
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you follow the precepts and rituals </v>

1780
01:33:16.571 --> 01:33:19.240
<v Speaker 2>of something that we would recognize as </v>
<v Speaker 2>a standard religion?</v>

1781
01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:21.350
<v Speaker 2>And lots of people will say no to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1782
01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:25.210
<v Speaker 2>but then you watch them and you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a Nietzschean observation.</v>

1783
01:33:25.750 --> 01:33:26.583
<v Speaker 2>What makes you think that the morality </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you consider moral hasn't been </v>

1784
01:33:29.201 --> 01:33:30.034
<v Speaker 2>conditioned to the absolute last degree </v>
<v Speaker 2>by 2000 years or 3000 years of in the </v>

1785
01:33:34.061 --> 01:33:36.880
<v Speaker 2>West at least Judeo Christian tradition.</v>

1786
01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:38.583
<v Speaker 2>It's like all the ideas of fundamentally</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the ideas that individuals have </v>

1787
01:33:41.981 --> 01:33:43.900
<v Speaker 2>value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we just,</v>

1788
01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:46.420
<v Speaker 2>which is very peculiar idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1789
01:33:46.421 --> 01:33:49.180
<v Speaker 2>everyone here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all you people virtually I would suspect</v>

1790
01:33:49.181 --> 01:33:50.080
<v Speaker 2>believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1791
01:33:50.110 --> 01:33:52.570
<v Speaker 2>why do you believe that and what do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean you believe it?</v>

1792
01:33:53.650 --> 01:33:54.483
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what it means is you act as if it's </v>

1793
01:33:57.461 --> 01:33:58.294
<v Speaker 2>true and I don't care what you say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what the hell do you know about </v>

1794
01:34:01.001 --> 01:34:02.590
<v Speaker 2>what you believe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1795
01:34:02.591 --> 01:34:03.730
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you come to university,</v>

1796
01:34:03.731 --> 01:34:04.564
<v Speaker 2>you can probably spout off a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideologies and rationalize all sorts of </v>

1797
01:34:07.721 --> 01:34:10.390
<v Speaker 2>complex behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the idea that you actually know what</v>

1798
01:34:10.391 --> 01:34:14.560
<v Speaker 2>you're up to or who you are is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you think that you're the most</v>

1799
01:34:14.561 --> 01:34:15.394
<v Speaker 2>complicated thing that exists?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't think you understand the </v>

1800
01:34:19.121 --> 01:34:20.320
<v Speaker 2>son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1801
01:34:20.330 --> 01:34:22.960
<v Speaker 2>in the son's a lot more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot less complicated than you are.</v>

1802
01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:24.153
<v Speaker 2>So I don't buy for a moment the idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people don't have religious </v>

1803
01:34:27.281 --> 01:34:28.114
<v Speaker 2>beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just are generally clueless about </v>

1804
01:34:29.231 --> 01:34:31.780
<v Speaker 2>what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and that's,</v>

1805
01:34:31.781 --> 01:34:32.614
<v Speaker 2>that's actually part of the problem I </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to address is that one of the </v>

1806
01:34:34.511 --> 01:34:39.511
<v Speaker 2>things that has happened is that in some</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense what the evolved religions,</v>

1807
01:34:40.691 --> 01:34:45.370
<v Speaker 2>let's call them did was there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavioral substructure that constitutes</v>

1808
01:34:45.371 --> 01:34:49.120
<v Speaker 2>cultural practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accepted cultural practice.</v>

1809
01:34:49.121 --> 01:34:52.570
<v Speaker 2>And I would say it's predicated on </v>
<v Speaker 2>observations.</v>

1810
01:34:52.571 --> 01:34:53.404
<v Speaker 2>Like there is an optimal pattern of </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior that's associated with across </v>

1811
01:34:57.981 --> 01:34:59.870
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the central value.</v>

1812
01:34:59.871 --> 01:35:01.850
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that happens everywhere.</v>

1813
01:35:01.851 --> 01:35:02.684
<v Speaker 2>And there's similarities in those </v>
<v Speaker 2>rituals because there are similarities </v>

1814
01:35:06.411 --> 01:35:09.110
<v Speaker 2>among human beings and similarities </v>
<v Speaker 2>among dominance hierarchies.</v>

1815
01:35:09.410 --> 01:35:11.870
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get the behavior laid down,</v>

1816
01:35:11.871 --> 01:35:12.704
<v Speaker 2>first is which everyone's acting like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pro social creature and then the next </v>

1817
01:35:16.821 --> 01:35:17.654
<v Speaker 2>thing you get is the representation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the symbolic representation of what the </v>

1818
01:35:20.901 --> 01:35:23.000
<v Speaker 2>pro sociality might be like.</v>

1819
01:35:23.210 --> 01:35:25.490
<v Speaker 2>And then you get that expressed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious symbolism.</v>

1820
01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:26.533
<v Speaker 2>And then on top of that you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like an articulated system of </v>

1821
01:35:30.231 --> 01:35:32.600
<v Speaker 2>religious propositions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then on top of that,</v>

1822
01:35:32.601 --> 01:35:35.570
<v Speaker 2>maybe you extract out a philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that,</v>

1823
01:35:35.810 --> 01:35:39.290
<v Speaker 2>so it's relatively coherent across </v>
<v Speaker 2>different levels of analysis.</v>

1824
01:35:39.530 --> 01:35:40.363
<v Speaker 2>Now what happened in the 19th century </v>
<v Speaker 2>and partly because of the rise of </v>

1825
01:35:42.591 --> 01:35:43.424
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the conscious element of the </v>

1826
01:35:45.501 --> 01:35:50.180
<v Speaker 2>religious belief got flipped on its head</v>
<v Speaker 2>because everybody woke up and said,</v>

1827
01:35:50.210 --> 01:35:52.940
<v Speaker 2>what the hell do we believe these things</v>
<v Speaker 2>for and what do we even mean?</v>

1828
01:35:52.941 --> 01:35:55.670
<v Speaker 2>They're true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>virgin birth and reincarnated,</v>

1829
01:35:55.671 --> 01:35:56.950
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1830
01:35:57.250 --> 01:36:01.940
<v Speaker 2>for God the father and all the peculiar </v>
<v Speaker 2>propositions of Christianity and Judaism</v>

1831
01:36:01.941 --> 01:36:04.370
<v Speaker 2>and Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we wake up,</v>

1832
01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:06.050
<v Speaker 2>we think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1833
01:36:06.051 --> 01:36:07.820
<v Speaker 2>look what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what we're doing,</v>

1834
01:36:07.821 --> 01:36:11.390
<v Speaker 2>and here we have this whole new body of </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge that suggest that none of that</v>

1835
01:36:11.391 --> 01:36:14.330
<v Speaker 2>is factually true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1836
01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:15.710
<v Speaker 2>no one was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1837
01:36:15.711 --> 01:36:17.540
<v Speaker 2>maybe there's more than one form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>

1838
01:36:17.570 --> 01:36:18.403
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people weren't thinking about </v>

1839
01:36:19.610 --> 01:36:21.230
<v Speaker 2>pragmatic truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1840
01:36:21.231 --> 01:36:22.064
<v Speaker 2>or behavioral truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were having this weird conflict </v>

1841
01:36:24.170 --> 01:36:26.570
<v Speaker 2>which you all suffer from between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1842
01:36:26.571 --> 01:36:29.570
<v Speaker 2>a materialist description of reality and</v>

1843
01:36:30.810 --> 01:36:31.643
<v Speaker 1>what</v>

1844
01:36:32.190 --> 01:36:35.610
<v Speaker 2>religious propositions that didn't seem </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be in concordance with that.</v>

1845
01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:37.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've looked far out into heaven through</v>

1846
01:36:37.711 --> 01:36:38.544
<v Speaker 2>the Hubble Hubble telescope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody found God because that means </v>

1847
01:36:41.950 --> 01:36:45.300
<v Speaker 2>there is no God in heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on what you mean by God.</v>

1848
01:36:45.390 --> 01:36:46.223
<v Speaker 2>Depends on what you mean by heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not obvious at all that the </v>

1849
01:36:49.591 --> 01:36:50.424
<v Speaker 2>heaven of the Medieval thinkers is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same as the space that we know about </v>

1850
01:36:53.911 --> 01:36:56.850
<v Speaker 2>from an empirical perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not obvious at all.</v>

1851
01:36:57.330 --> 01:36:57.781
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1852
01:36:57.781 --> 01:37:01.610
<v Speaker 2>so let's stop for a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For 10 minutes.</v>

1853
01:37:01.611 --> 01:37:02.444
<v Speaker 2>Let's say.</v>
