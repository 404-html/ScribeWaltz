00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm here today with Ben Shapiro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about eight months ago,</v>

2
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.590
<v Speaker 1>wave came up to Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would gave a rousing talk and uh,</v>

3
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.740
<v Speaker 1>talk about political correctness at that</v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

4
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.010
<v Speaker 1>credit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politically pointed political talk and </v>

5
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.010
<v Speaker 1>how you got a couple of questions for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

6
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.590
<v Speaker 1>One is what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

7
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.380
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you planning to do in 2018?</v>

8
00:00:36.381 --> 00:00:39.140
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to see happen in 2018 </v>
<v Speaker 1>personally?</v>

9
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.620
<v Speaker 1>And then what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

10
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.160
<v Speaker 1>so what are you aiming at?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

11
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.730
<v Speaker 2>So I mean obviously I'm aiming it at </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadening the reach of the political </v>

12
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.860
<v Speaker 2>messages that I espouse and the messages</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

13
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.960
<v Speaker 2>of I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>personal responsibility in virtue that </v>

14
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.960
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I tried to espouse.</v>

15
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm also working on a book that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>really interested in right now about the</v>

16
00:00:57.671 --> 00:01:02.671
<v Speaker 2>roots of Western civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that makes for a happier and </v>

17
00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:06.691
<v Speaker 2>more fulfilled Western civilization?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What generates purpose for civilization </v>

18
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:10.111
<v Speaker 2>and for individuals and why it is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we seem to have lost purpose because my </v>

19
00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:13.081
<v Speaker 2>general theory is that the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to murder each other </v>

20
00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:15.470
<v Speaker 2>politically and the reason that we hate </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other so much is that there is a </v>

21
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.400
<v Speaker 2>purpose shaped hole in our heart that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>are now filling with anger,</v>

22
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.200
<v Speaker 2>tribal anger at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

23
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.400
<v Speaker 2>and I'm trying to trace back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of backtrack and say,</v>

24
00:01:21.401 --> 00:01:22.000
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where did,</v>

25
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:23.110
<v Speaker 2>where did we go wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where,</v>

26
00:01:23.111 --> 00:01:24.190
<v Speaker 2>where was purpose?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of,</v>

27
00:01:24.191 --> 00:01:25.720
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's high watermark.</v>

28
00:01:25.721 --> 00:01:26.960
<v Speaker 2>And why are we now at Loeb?</v>

29
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I found in the </v>

30
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:33.040
<v Speaker 1>discussions that I've had over the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

31
00:01:33.041 --> 00:01:36.000
<v Speaker 1>especially the public discussions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>public lectures,</v>

32
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.010
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it seems perfectly possible to </v>

33
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.451
<v Speaker 1>make a room go silent by speaking to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's a room full of young </v>

34
00:01:45.451 --> 00:01:47.080
<v Speaker 1>men by speaking to them about </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility of truth.</v>

35
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.590
<v Speaker 1>And this is really staggered me because </v>
<v Speaker 1>those are obviously saleable messages </v>

36
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.300
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially for someone who's rather </v>

37
00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.300
<v Speaker 1>cynical about the fundamental nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings.</v>

38
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you,</v>

39
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.690
<v Speaker 1>if you launched a business plan to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>typical observers and said,</v>

40
00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:09.691
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to base up public movement on </v>

41
00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:14.640
<v Speaker 1>the adoption of access,</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and the requirement to </v>

42
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.731
<v Speaker 1>speak the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's going to become hyper </v>

43
00:02:17.731 --> 00:02:19.831
<v Speaker 1>popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The probability that people would agree </v>

44
00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:20.230
<v Speaker 1>that that's a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty much zero.</v>

45
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.920
<v Speaker 1>And so I've been thinking that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken about rights for so long and </v>

46
00:02:26.171 --> 00:02:29.710
<v Speaker 1>spoken about freedoms for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say since the early sixties,</v>

47
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.130
<v Speaker 1>just essentially speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've actually left a conceptual whole </v>

48
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.930
<v Speaker 1>inner culture and that seems to be akin </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

49
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.410
<v Speaker 1>to the point that you're making with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to this book and now you,</v>

50
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.450
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned responsibility and why </v>

51
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.450
<v Speaker 1>that specifically?</v>

52
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that what you're talking about </v>

53
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.750
<v Speaker 2>is exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People in the West have seemed to pose,</v>

54
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.790
<v Speaker 2>writes in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in direct opposition to duties.</v>

55
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:54.580
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

56
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.460
<v Speaker 2>the American founding particularly was </v>
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with this idea of,</v>

57
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.510
<v Speaker 2>of rights and individual rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was also this corresponding </v>

58
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 2>idea of duties that's very clear in </v>
<v Speaker 2>founding thinking.</v>

59
00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 2>George Washington talks about duty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Benjamin Franklin talks about duty.</v>

60
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 2>The idea was that duty was to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>socially generated,</v>

61
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.550
<v Speaker 2>not by government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by,</v>

62
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.430
<v Speaker 2>by society itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like small communities,</v>

63
00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:13.840
<v Speaker 2>by churches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by your family,</v>

64
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.080
<v Speaker 2>and that that would fill the gap that </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed you to actually have a </v>

65
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Speaker 2>functioning society of rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we seem to have left duty completely</v>

66
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:25.141
<v Speaker 2>behind now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just all about the right to not </v>

67
00:03:25.141 --> 00:03:26.881
<v Speaker 2>about the duty and what's happened is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's collapsed in on itself </v>

68
00:03:26.881 --> 00:03:30.301
<v Speaker 2>because the society of only right to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know duties ends up generating raw </v>

69
00:03:30.301 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 2>generating duties masquerading as </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights,</v>

70
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

71
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.270
<v Speaker 2>Positive rights that are actually not </v>
<v Speaker 2>right at all.</v>

72
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:37.660
<v Speaker 2>There are me imposing a duty on you in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to further my own perception of my</v>

73
00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:42.661
<v Speaker 2>rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's I think where we've been </v>

74
00:03:42.661 --> 00:03:44.701
<v Speaker 2>going and it's in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a dark place and it creates an </v>

75
00:03:44.701 --> 00:03:45.370
<v Speaker 2>enormous amount of opposition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you say Jordan,</v>

76
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:48.130
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you talk about the fact that people</v>

77
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.160
<v Speaker 2>would not have thought of building a </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement on notions of truth and </v>

78
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.501
<v Speaker 2>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's because I think for a long time </v>

79
00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:55.750
<v Speaker 2>people just took it for granted that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>all agreed on these things.</v>

80
00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's been an actual forcible </v>

81
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.620
<v Speaker 2>counter movement for generations now </v>
<v Speaker 2>against both truth and responsibility.</v>

82
00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 2>The idea that there is no objective </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth,</v>

83
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.210
<v Speaker 2>it's socially defined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can make it up as we go along.</v>

84
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.660
<v Speaker 2>There's no t los rev.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talk a lot in the new book about,</v>

85
00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:12.460
<v Speaker 2>about a teleological way of thinking.</v>

86
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.460
<v Speaker 2>This idea that you actually have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose for which you were created and </v>

87
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:21.211
<v Speaker 2>that it's your job to fulfill that </v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose and that's completely been left </v>

88
00:04:21.211 --> 00:04:21.211
<v Speaker 2>by the wayside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's no truth,</v>

89
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:26.300
<v Speaker 2>there is no capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even write the scientific materialist </v>

90
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.930
<v Speaker 2>worldview actually robs you have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity to even change yourself.</v>

91
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.990
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The studies that I've seen suggests that</v>

92
00:04:28.991 --> 00:04:30.910
<v Speaker 2>if you believe in a certain form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>determinism,</v>

93
00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:35.911
<v Speaker 2>if you believe in hard determinism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're less likely to go out and </v>

94
00:04:35.911 --> 00:04:38.431
<v Speaker 2>actually change your life and make it </v>
<v Speaker 2>better because you buy into your own </v>

95
00:04:38.431 --> 00:04:41.041
<v Speaker 2>philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that as a side sort of </v>

96
00:04:41.041 --> 00:04:43.291
<v Speaker 2>bought into that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're all victims of our own </v>

97
00:04:43.291 --> 00:04:44.911
<v Speaker 2>biology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Victims of own raise victims were on </v>

98
00:04:44.911 --> 00:04:44.911
<v Speaker 2>ethnicity or our situation and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>no way for us to get out of that.</v>

99
00:04:44.911 --> 00:04:49.831
<v Speaker 2>So we may as well throw up our hands or </v>
<v Speaker 2>at least give the power to the only </v>

100
00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:49.831
<v Speaker 2>thing that can change things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is this,</v>

101
00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:53.440
<v Speaker 2>which is this massive collective that </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes in and is the boot stomping on the</v>

102
00:04:53.441 --> 00:04:54.220
<v Speaker 2>human face forever.</v>

103
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also the strange misapprehension</v>

104
00:04:57.711 --> 00:04:59.690
<v Speaker 1>I think with regards to the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights,</v>

105
00:04:59.691 --> 00:05:04.691
<v Speaker 1>because as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean rights rights are a multifaceted </v>

106
00:05:05.331 --> 00:05:10.070
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think the least metaphysical claim</v>

107
00:05:10.071 --> 00:05:13.150
<v Speaker 1>that you can make about rights is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>if I have a right,</v>

108
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.250
<v Speaker 1>then that brings with it a parallel </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>

109
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.260
<v Speaker 1>not only to myself to act in a manner </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is in accordance with that,</v>

110
00:05:21.261 --> 00:05:22.520
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that happens to be,</v>

111
00:05:22.521 --> 00:05:27.521
<v Speaker 1>but I also have a responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the right is universal to act in a </v>

112
00:05:27.521 --> 00:05:32.051
<v Speaker 1>certain manner towards you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so because there is no difference </v>

113
00:05:32.051 --> 00:05:35.690
<v Speaker 1>between rights and responsibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally they're just mirror images</v>

114
00:05:35.691 --> 00:05:40.691
<v Speaker 1>of one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that that's to say nothing about </v>

115
00:05:40.691 --> 00:05:41.000
<v Speaker 1>their potential metaphysical orange and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to talk about that,</v>

116
00:05:41.001 --> 00:05:46.001
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't seem to me to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>logically 10 bubbles have an incident </v>

117
00:05:46.001 --> 00:05:50.291
<v Speaker 1>conversation about rights without having</v>
<v Speaker 1>a parallel conversation about </v>

118
00:05:50.291 --> 00:05:50.291
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

119
00:05:50.291 --> 00:05:54.350
<v Speaker 1>So there's a logical flow and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaves that gap that needs to be filled.</v>

120
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.630
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing that's occurred</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me is that the,</v>

121
00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:03.890
<v Speaker 1>the genuine meaning in lights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do believe that likes has a </v>

122
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.300
<v Speaker 1>genuine meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I can make that claim without </v>

123
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.001
<v Speaker 1>even making it metaphysical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I don't mind the metaphysical </v>

124
00:06:10.001 --> 00:06:10.640
<v Speaker 1>addition to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

125
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.210
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that almost all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that people find meaningful in </v>

126
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.160
<v Speaker 1>life that aren't merely impulsive </v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasure,</v>

127
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.580
<v Speaker 1>which of course create thrown </v>
<v Speaker 1>entanglements,</v>

128
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.700
<v Speaker 1>have to do with the voluntary adoption </v>
<v Speaker 1>of responsibility.</v>

129
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.150
<v Speaker 1>So families like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

130
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:27.170
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

131
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:28.430
<v Speaker 1>so then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

132
00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:30.380
<v Speaker 1>so here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the next question.</v>

133
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:36.290
<v Speaker 1>What do you think it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's driven our loss and of that half of</v>

134
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:38.240
<v Speaker 1>the conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happened?</v>

135
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:44.230
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that this has been basically a </v>

136
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.230
<v Speaker 2>200 year movement that first manifested </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself in Europe.</v>

137
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.190
<v Speaker 2>And it's finally reaching American </v>
<v Speaker 2>shores about 100 years later,</v>

138
00:06:46.191 --> 00:06:51.191
<v Speaker 2>which seems to be the pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the bad stuff from Europe hits </v>

139
00:06:51.191 --> 00:06:52.040
<v Speaker 2>Europe about 50 to 100 years before it </v>
<v Speaker 2>hits here and now it comes here.</v>

140
00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.910
<v Speaker 2>I think that what happened here is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the enlightenment mentality was built on</v>

141
00:06:55.911 --> 00:06:58.340
<v Speaker 2>certain fundamental premises,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including the use of human reason,</v>

142
00:06:58.341 --> 00:07:02.900
<v Speaker 2>the capacity for free will and all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that in turn rested on assumptions about</v>

143
00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:05.060
<v Speaker 2>the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including the idea that the universe has</v>

144
00:07:05.061 --> 00:07:10.061
<v Speaker 2>a discoverable design that we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually find and pursue and that in </v>

145
00:07:10.061 --> 00:07:11.060
<v Speaker 2>doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will find happiness.</v>

146
00:07:11.061 --> 00:07:16.061
<v Speaker 2>The Aristotelian idea of happiness is </v>
<v Speaker 2>very much bound up with the idea of you </v>

147
00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:18.800
<v Speaker 2>fulfilling your lowe's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Judeo Christian idea of happiness is</v>

148
00:07:18.801 --> 00:07:20.420
<v Speaker 2>you fulfilling God's purpose for you.</v>

149
00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.850
<v Speaker 2>There was always this idea of a higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose that you were seeking.</v>

150
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.100
<v Speaker 2>And I think what happened is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

151
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:30.130
<v Speaker 2>the enlightenment project,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which started off in an attempt really </v>

152
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:30.290
<v Speaker 2>in the 13th century by people like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Aquinas,</v>

153
00:07:30.291 --> 00:07:35.291
<v Speaker 2>my monities to unite religion and </v>
<v Speaker 2>science fell apart when they started to </v>

154
00:07:35.291 --> 00:07:35.800
<v Speaker 2>divide the two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of it's we're,</v>

155
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:40.830
<v Speaker 2>we're seeking the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Religion and science are both seeking a </v>

156
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:44.110
<v Speaker 2>universal truths that can be applicable </v>
<v Speaker 2>to our own lives and make us more </v>

157
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:45.380
<v Speaker 2>fulfilled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The project of science became to destroy</v>

158
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.290
<v Speaker 2>one pole to destroy religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then by doing that,</v>

159
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:50.840
<v Speaker 2>science almost turned in on itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reason almost eight itself.</v>

160
00:07:50.841 --> 00:07:53.000
<v Speaker 2>So I think reason basically turned into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

161
00:07:53.001 --> 00:07:55.550
<v Speaker 2>we're going to follow to the logical end</v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

162
00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.840
<v Speaker 2>All of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the nonreligious bases of,</v>

163
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.010
<v Speaker 2>of human thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once you do that,</v>

164
00:08:01.011 --> 00:08:03.610
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult not to fall into a.</v>

165
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:07.760
<v Speaker 2>So a sort of self refuting trap about </v>
<v Speaker 2>human thought.</v>

166
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:12.820
<v Speaker 2>You're just a set of neurons that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>firing neurons don't have </v>

167
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:12.830
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your dog doesn't have responsibility.</v>

168
00:08:12.831 --> 00:08:14.230
<v Speaker 2>Do you have responsibility?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

169
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.880
<v Speaker 2>you are a product of your environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your biology.</v>

170
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.400
<v Speaker 2>Does that carry with it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any sort of moral responsibility,</v>

171
00:08:19.401 --> 00:08:21.800
<v Speaker 2>you don't have the capacity to choose if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have the capacity to choose.</v>

172
00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:26.801
<v Speaker 2>How do you have moral responsibility?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I debated Sam Harris on particularly </v>

173
00:08:26.801 --> 00:08:28.010
<v Speaker 2>this issue and I thought that actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most telling point of the debate and</v>

174
00:08:28.011 --> 00:08:31.190
<v Speaker 2>discussion was not anything the two of </v>
<v Speaker 2>us said it was a woman who got up at the</v>

175
00:08:31.191 --> 00:08:33.020
<v Speaker 2>very end instead of Sam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I totally agree with you.</v>

176
00:08:33.021 --> 00:08:36.280
<v Speaker 2>There's no free will in the hard sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't make any sense you.</v>

177
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.480
<v Speaker 2>There is no choice other than to write </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

178
00:08:38.481 --> 00:08:41.180
<v Speaker 2>You will have to do this just driven by </v>
<v Speaker 2>your biology and environment.</v>

179
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.020
<v Speaker 2>But I have a five year old son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you want and what,</v>

180
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.100
<v Speaker 2>what should I say to him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Sam basically said,</v>

181
00:08:46.101 --> 00:08:48.230
<v Speaker 2>lie basically said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

182
00:08:48.231 --> 00:08:50.210
<v Speaker 2>tell him that he's capable of making a </v>
<v Speaker 2>choice.</v>

183
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:55.240
<v Speaker 2>And that's the truth about civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either you believe that's a lie and </v>

184
00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.910
<v Speaker 2>you're actively engaging in Plato's good</v>
<v Speaker 2>lie basically,</v>

185
00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.690
<v Speaker 2>or your or you have to believe in free </v>
<v Speaker 2>will.</v>

186
00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:03.270
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the capacity to choose and</v>

187
00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:04.980
<v Speaker 2>the capacity to self better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

188
00:09:04.981 --> 00:09:05.940
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a lie.</v>

189
00:09:05.941 --> 00:09:07.950
<v Speaker 2>I think that people do have the capacity</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do that.</v>

190
00:09:07.951 --> 00:09:10.830
<v Speaker 2>I think even Sam believes that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he refuses to acknowledge it because</v>

191
00:09:10.831 --> 00:09:14.070
<v Speaker 2>otherwise I don't think he would be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the educational position that he is.</v>

192
00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:19.071
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He spends his life trying to educate </v>

193
00:09:19.071 --> 00:09:19.071
<v Speaker 2>people so that that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all weird.</v>

194
00:09:19.071 --> 00:09:19.071
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually said in the,</v>

195
00:09:19.071 --> 00:09:20.550
<v Speaker 2>in the discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are we all in this auditorium?</v>

196
00:09:20.551 --> 00:09:25.551
<v Speaker 2>We were just sort of predestined by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe to be in this auditorium at a </v>

197
00:09:25.551 --> 00:09:25.551
<v Speaker 2>certain time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

198
00:09:25.551 --> 00:09:26.880
<v Speaker 2>do you feel fulfilled by that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If so,</v>

199
00:09:26.881 --> 00:09:28.110
<v Speaker 2>you really have no choice in the matter.</v>

200
00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that bothered me about</v>

201
00:09:31.211 --> 00:09:34.720
<v Speaker 1>the new atheist types and the hyper </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationalist is that there,</v>

202
00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:38.480
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell their conduct is </v>
<v Speaker 1>performative contradiction.</v>

203
00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.190
<v Speaker 1>They say they believe certain things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't act that way.</v>

204
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:43.960
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in my sense,</v>

205
00:09:43.961 --> 00:09:48.550
<v Speaker 1>because I'm an existentialist at heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what you believe is what you act</v>

206
00:09:48.551 --> 00:09:51.070
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you say might be in accordance with</v>

207
00:09:51.071 --> 00:09:52.750
<v Speaker 1>that and it might not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

208
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.720
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

209
00:09:53.721 --> 00:09:57.280
<v Speaker 1>and there's no reason to assume that </v>
<v Speaker 1>your beliefs are transparent to yourself</v>

210
00:09:57.281 --> 00:10:02.281
<v Speaker 1>regardless of your plate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I also don't see any evidence </v>

211
00:10:02.281 --> 00:10:06.871
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever that the society can exist </v>
<v Speaker 1>that functions over any reasonable </v>

212
00:10:06.871 --> 00:10:11.610
<v Speaker 1>period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in any reasonable manner without </v>

213
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.670
<v Speaker 1>predicating itself on the beliefs that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are both capable of freewill am,</v>

214
00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:19.680
<v Speaker 1>that they're responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the fact that it seems to be </v>

215
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.951
<v Speaker 1>impossible to build a functioning </v>
<v Speaker 1>society or even functioning dyadic </v>

216
00:10:22.951 --> 00:10:27.511
<v Speaker 1>relationships for that matter in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>absence of the presupposition of free </v>

217
00:10:27.511 --> 00:10:31.761
<v Speaker 1>will and the capacity for voluntary </v>
<v Speaker 1>change indicates to me some evidence for</v>

218
00:10:31.901 --> 00:10:33.820
<v Speaker 1>the existence of those capacities.</v>

219
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.290
<v Speaker 1>And you have to be a staggeringly </v>
<v Speaker 1>cynical person to think that no,</v>

220
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:42.300
<v Speaker 1>we just have to believe that that's true</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's a lie and predicate or </v>

221
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.360
<v Speaker 1>cultures or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's first of all I know,</v>

222
00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:50.580
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a weak claim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that it's also not the </v>

223
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.940
<v Speaker 1>rock upon which you want to fall into </v>
<v Speaker 1>your culture.</v>

224
00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:57.720
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that struck me </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the mythological stories that </v>

225
00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.500
<v Speaker 1>aren't immersed myself in is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always three.</v>

226
00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:01.930
<v Speaker 1>There's always three prime characters in</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

227
00:11:01.931 --> 00:11:04.360
<v Speaker 1>Ms Dot logical story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's culture,</v>

228
00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the great father,</v>

229
00:11:06.071 --> 00:11:08.800
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And many mythological guises and there's</v>

230
00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:13.830
<v Speaker 1>nature that's the great mother and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say that that's the biology and </v>

231
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:18.451
<v Speaker 1>society of the modern scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's the independent </v>

232
00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:21.580
<v Speaker 1>individual as a causal force who has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature that enables,</v>

233
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.610
<v Speaker 1>enables choice and free will in all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>

234
00:11:24.611 --> 00:11:29.611
<v Speaker 1>And that that independent third factor </v>
<v Speaker 1>is something like the logos that gives </v>

235
00:11:29.611 --> 00:11:31.180
<v Speaker 1>rise to being at the beginning of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

236
00:11:31.181 --> 00:11:34.180
<v Speaker 1>The cast that calls order fourth out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

237
00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:37.960
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that we can't account for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that scientifically.</v>

238
00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.000
<v Speaker 1>Although I don't think we can deny it </v>
<v Speaker 1>either,</v>

239
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:41.980
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.</v>

240
00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I totally agree with that.</v>

241
00:11:44.441 --> 00:11:49.441
<v Speaker 2>And of course I enjoy maps of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm pretty familiar with the </v>

242
00:11:49.441 --> 00:11:49.570
<v Speaker 2>terminology that you use because I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>read your book,</v>

243
00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:54.870
<v Speaker 2>but I think that there's this idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can find meaning in a meaningless </v>

244
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:59.581
<v Speaker 2>universe that we're just meatballs </v>
<v Speaker 2>wandering through space with a little </v>

245
00:11:59.581 --> 00:11:59.581
<v Speaker 2>bit of sentience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

246
00:11:59.581 --> 00:12:01.090
<v Speaker 2>understanding that where our meatballs </v>
<v Speaker 2>wandering through space,</v>

247
00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:06.091
<v Speaker 2>I have a hard time building any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>system on that and the refusal of the </v>

248
00:12:06.091 --> 00:12:08.500
<v Speaker 2>new atheist to even recognize that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>morality that they promulgated right,</v>

249
00:12:08.501 --> 00:12:13.501
<v Speaker 2>the trip that they have on religion </v>
<v Speaker 2>typically is that religion is barbaric </v>

250
00:12:13.501 --> 00:12:14.410
<v Speaker 2>and backwards and promulgates all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 2>of horrible moral values that with which</v>

251
00:12:14.411 --> 00:12:19.411
<v Speaker 2>they disagree and what they refuse to </v>
<v Speaker 2>acknowledge that their moral values are </v>

252
00:12:19.411 --> 00:12:20.460
<v Speaker 2>predicated within that system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

253
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:25.710
<v Speaker 2>For the vast majority of human time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the values that they are espousing or </v>

254
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:25.710
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only not universal,</v>

255
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:26.200
<v Speaker 2>they're not even minority valleys.</v>

256
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.720
<v Speaker 2>They didn't exist for the vast majority </v>
<v Speaker 2>of human time.</v>

257
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:33.250
<v Speaker 2>They are absolute creations of the Judeo</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian system that is combined with a</v>

258
00:12:33.251 --> 00:12:38.251
<v Speaker 2>Greek reason to come up with what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have today and this is essentially the </v>

259
00:12:38.251 --> 00:12:42.871
<v Speaker 2>theory that I have come up with is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is the thesis of the book that </v>

260
00:12:42.871 --> 00:12:46.321
<v Speaker 2>I'm writing right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that in order for an in order </v>

261
00:12:46.321 --> 00:12:46.840
<v Speaker 2>for society or an individual to feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>fulfilled,</v>

262
00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.300
<v Speaker 2>you basically have to have four things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have an individual purpose.</v>

263
00:12:49.301 --> 00:12:51.190
<v Speaker 2>You have to feel like you have a purpose</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>

264
00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.750
<v Speaker 2>You personally have a purpose in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

265
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.730
<v Speaker 2>You have to feel like you have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual capacity.</v>

266
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:57.990
<v Speaker 2>You have to feel like you are capable of</v>
<v Speaker 2>pursuing that with alacrity.</v>

267
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:59.500
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to have a communal purpose.</v>

268
00:12:59.501 --> 00:13:02.560
<v Speaker 2>You have to feel like you alone with </v>
<v Speaker 2>others are pursuing a higher goal.</v>

269
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.810
<v Speaker 2>That means something and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have communal capacity.</v>

270
00:13:04.811 --> 00:13:09.811
<v Speaker 2>So a system that has been built that </v>
<v Speaker 2>allows that community to activate when </v>

271
00:13:09.811 --> 00:13:13.111
<v Speaker 2>it needs to activate and back off so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the individual can exist in that </v>

272
00:13:13.111 --> 00:13:16.381
<v Speaker 2>vacuum and we have torn away at all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>roots of those things because all of </v>

273
00:13:16.541 --> 00:13:19.420
<v Speaker 2>those things that I think the apotheosis</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the.</v>

274
00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:24.440
<v Speaker 2>I think the apex of modern thought was </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically the unfulfilled but universal </v>

275
00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.080
<v Speaker 2>theories of the American founding </v>
<v Speaker 2>fathers,</v>

276
00:13:26.081 --> 00:13:29.020
<v Speaker 2>I think is about as good as it got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>internal governmental theory.</v>

277
00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:30.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's gotten better since </v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

278
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.290
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's been extended more </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadly.</v>

279
00:13:32.291 --> 00:13:37.291
<v Speaker 2>I think the universalism that they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>implying has now been applied in many </v>

280
00:13:37.291 --> 00:13:37.291
<v Speaker 2>ways and that's a great thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

281
00:13:37.291 --> 00:13:39.610
<v Speaker 2>Did the founders obviously still held </v>
<v Speaker 2>slaves?</v>

282
00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:40.640
<v Speaker 2>Many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're,</v>

283
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:42.970
<v Speaker 2>their principals were not in favor of </v>
<v Speaker 2>slavery.</v>

284
00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:48.130
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the principles that they espoused </v>

285
00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:48.130
<v Speaker 2>were based on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

286
00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:51.480
<v Speaker 2>these two competing poles that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are constantly intention with one </v>

287
00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.721
<v Speaker 2>another and this sort of Leo Strauss he </v>
<v Speaker 2>intention with one another between </v>

288
00:13:54.721 --> 00:13:58.500
<v Speaker 2>reason and revelation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Judeo Christian tradition and the </v>

289
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.460
<v Speaker 2>Greek tradition of reason and the tug </v>
<v Speaker 2>and back and forth is what allows you to</v>

290
00:14:00.461 --> 00:14:02.920
<v Speaker 2>have one foot in rights and one foot in </v>
<v Speaker 2>duties.</v>

291
00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:09.700
<v Speaker 1>So we really good to have a lengthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation about this at some point </v>

292
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.340
<v Speaker 1>because there's some things in here that</v>
<v Speaker 1>really have to be delving deeply like </v>

293
00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.750
<v Speaker 1>the day you have to find your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose.</v>

294
00:14:15.751 --> 00:14:20.751
<v Speaker 1>Argument was one that was put forth </v>
<v Speaker 1>third stroke and after he announced the </v>

295
00:14:20.751 --> 00:14:22.620
<v Speaker 1>death of God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said that people would have to resale</v>

296
00:14:22.621 --> 00:14:27.621
<v Speaker 1>you good and evil and to come up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own definitions of what </v>

297
00:14:27.621 --> 00:14:28.680
<v Speaker 1>constituted morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like the Nietzschean criticism of,</v>

298
00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:33.850
<v Speaker 1>of Christianity is about as deep as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>got with the possible exception of </v>

299
00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:34.890
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's,</v>

300
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.080
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I really liked about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl Young,</v>

301
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:40.920
<v Speaker 1>and it's really struck me as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as is irrefutable,</v>

302
00:14:40.921 --> 00:14:44.580
<v Speaker 1>is use fundamental response to nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that,</v>

303
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

304
00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:51.450
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take the argument of the death of </v>

305
00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:53.661
<v Speaker 1>God to its logical conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then let's the idea that human </v>

306
00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:55.700
<v Speaker 1>beings have to be the creator of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>creators of their own systems,</v>

307
00:14:55.701 --> 00:14:56.240
<v Speaker 1>of meaning.</v>

308
00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.180
<v Speaker 1>You idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was also the case for the other</v>

309
00:14:59.181 --> 00:15:00.500
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalyst Swiss.</v>

310
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:05.740
<v Speaker 1>That's just palpably false because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>turns out that you're not the sort of </v>

311
00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:07.640
<v Speaker 1>creature that can create your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>

312
00:15:07.641 --> 00:15:10.910
<v Speaker 1>You're the sort of creature that has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>discover the meaning that already exists</v>

313
00:15:10.911 --> 00:15:14.120
<v Speaker 1>in coded within you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of that is that you're not your</v>

314
00:15:14.121 --> 00:15:16.390
<v Speaker 1>own slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

315
00:15:16.391 --> 00:15:18.950
<v Speaker 1>so it's a critique not only of the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can,</v>

316
00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:23.951
<v Speaker 1>will your own destiny in its entirety </v>
<v Speaker 1>while completely ignoring the fact that </v>

317
00:15:23.951 --> 00:15:25.760
<v Speaker 1>you have in nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a profound critique of the</v>

318
00:15:25.761 --> 00:15:30.761
<v Speaker 1>socialist Utopian ideas that human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings can be mold in any way that they </v>

319
00:15:30.761 --> 00:15:34.571
<v Speaker 1>see fit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so young subjection was something </v>

320
00:15:34.571 --> 00:15:34.571
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

321
00:15:34.571 --> 00:15:37.220
<v Speaker 1>try to generate a meeting on your own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of nothing,</v>

322
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.630
<v Speaker 1>and then try to force yourself to follow</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and see how far you get.</v>

323
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:45.260
<v Speaker 1>What you'll find is that you rebelled </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own nature,</v>

324
00:15:45.261 --> 00:15:50.261
<v Speaker 1>rebels in every possible way against the</v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary imposition of a certain of </v>

325
00:15:50.261 --> 00:15:55.240
<v Speaker 1>just any old moral framework on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner in which you're going to conduct </v>

326
00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:55.240
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

327
00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:56.650
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is potentially it's,</v>

328
00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:58.170
<v Speaker 2>it's such a deep critique and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's.</v>

329
00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:03.180
<v Speaker 2>It's so telling because what we've come </v>
<v Speaker 2>up with is that the substitute for what </v>

330
00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:04.620
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is this acknowledgement that there</v>

331
00:16:04.621 --> 00:16:08.190
<v Speaker 2>is a universal purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we ought to be aspiring to discover</v>

332
00:16:08.191 --> 00:16:10.350
<v Speaker 2>that it's actually out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a purpose out there and it's our</v>

333
00:16:10.351 --> 00:16:12.970
<v Speaker 2>job to uncover it as opposed to self </v>
<v Speaker 2>creating it.</v>

334
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:16.320
<v Speaker 2>That that is a really deep divide in in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

335
00:16:16.321 --> 00:16:19.020
<v Speaker 2>I think in the West generally because </v>
<v Speaker 2>what people have said is,</v>

336
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.500
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

337
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.630
<v Speaker 2>we finally realized that we do need this</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing called purpose,</v>

338
00:16:21.631 --> 00:16:22.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't just be a hedonist,</v>

339
00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:24.360
<v Speaker 2>solve the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs and sex aren't going to cut it.</v>

340
00:16:24.361 --> 00:16:27.630
<v Speaker 2>We're actually going to need to come up </v>
<v Speaker 2>with some purpose for Hydrus,</v>

341
00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:28.420
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but well,</v>

342
00:16:28.421 --> 00:16:30.960
<v Speaker 2>but we're not going to be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but but at the same time,</v>

343
00:16:30.961 --> 00:16:35.550
<v Speaker 2>we don't want a government or a society </v>
<v Speaker 2>or a church or a community forcing down.</v>

344
00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:40.500
<v Speaker 2>It's universal perception of values on </v>
<v Speaker 2>us and so therefore are our happy medium</v>

345
00:16:40.501 --> 00:16:42.750
<v Speaker 2>is going to be you define your own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your own freedom.</v>

346
00:16:42.751 --> 00:16:44.400
<v Speaker 2>You define your own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your own rights,</v>

347
00:16:44.401 --> 00:16:46.440
<v Speaker 2>and you define your own view of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>

348
00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:51.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is always going to just devolve </v>

349
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:54.741
<v Speaker 2>into this pathetic sort of solipsism </v>
<v Speaker 2>that can never be escaped from and it </v>

350
00:16:54.741 --> 00:16:59.291
<v Speaker 2>doesn't provide happiness anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the people who quote unquote </v>

351
00:16:59.291 --> 00:17:01.791
<v Speaker 2>define their own meaning are some of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>least happy people that you will ever </v>

352
00:17:01.791 --> 00:17:03.300
<v Speaker 2>meet because they don't believe that </v>
<v Speaker 2>their incontinence with anything larger.</v>

353
00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:04.830
<v Speaker 2>If you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're looking into your self,</v>

354
00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:06.600
<v Speaker 2>your self is not that big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not that much there,</v>

355
00:17:06.601 --> 00:17:08.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There has to be something beyond you.</v>

356
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:13.640
<v Speaker 2>Whether you find it in God or whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>you find it in in a community or a </v>

357
00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:13.650
<v Speaker 2>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there has to be something that speaks to</v>

358
00:17:13.651 --> 00:17:17.190
<v Speaker 2>you beyond the guts that exist inside </v>
<v Speaker 2>you where you're just examining your own</v>

359
00:17:17.191 --> 00:17:17.700
<v Speaker 2>intestines</v>

360
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:21.480
<v Speaker 1>to that you can make a strong scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>

361
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:24.390
<v Speaker 1>This is something I'd never gone to in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my discussions with Sam Harris,</v>

362
00:17:24.391 --> 00:17:29.391
<v Speaker 1>is you could make a strong scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>case for the reality of meaning as an as</v>

363
00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:34.890
<v Speaker 1>an for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just call it for the reality of </v>

364
00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:38.451
<v Speaker 1>meetings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might think about it as a </v>

365
00:17:38.451 --> 00:17:40.191
<v Speaker 1>psychological reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can think about it as a </v>

366
00:17:40.191 --> 00:17:42.510
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical or a biological reality too</v>
<v Speaker 1>because as far as I can tell and there's</v>

367
00:17:42.511 --> 00:17:47.511
<v Speaker 1>good neurological evidence for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your brain is adapted to two modes of </v>

368
00:17:47.511 --> 00:17:51.891
<v Speaker 1>being and one mode of being is that mode</v>
<v Speaker 1>that obtains when you're where you know </v>

369
00:17:51.891 --> 00:17:54.600
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing and you know what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on so you could call that explored</v>

370
00:17:54.601 --> 00:17:59.601
<v Speaker 1>territory that's safe and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>another motive being that is that which </v>

371
00:17:59.601 --> 00:18:01.920
<v Speaker 1>obtains and when you don't know what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

372
00:18:01.921 --> 00:18:03.810
<v Speaker 1>When you're an unexplored territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

373
00:18:03.811 --> 00:18:05.760
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals since the beginning of time have</v>

374
00:18:05.761 --> 00:18:10.761
<v Speaker 1>adapted to some combination of explored </v>
<v Speaker 1>an unexplored territory and that's </v>

375
00:18:10.761 --> 00:18:13.900
<v Speaker 1>roughly a kid to known and not known,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is what symbolized in knee</v>

376
00:18:13.901 --> 00:18:16.440
<v Speaker 1>and Yang symbols and as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell,</v>

377
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:21.890
<v Speaker 1>the sense of meaning that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience that spontaneous and deep is </v>

378
00:18:22.111 --> 00:18:24.180
<v Speaker 1>an indication that they're functioning </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

379
00:18:24.181 --> 00:18:29.181
<v Speaker 1>unexplored territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but simultaneously increasing their </v>

380
00:18:29.181 --> 00:18:32.481
<v Speaker 1>capacity to deal with unexplored </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory so it's like the zone of </v>

381
00:18:32.481 --> 00:18:36.531
<v Speaker 1>proximal development or even the flow </v>
<v Speaker 1>states that chicks at Harley is talked </v>

382
00:18:36.531 --> 00:18:40.311
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but see the best thing to be is where </v>

383
00:18:40.311 --> 00:18:43.731
<v Speaker 1>things are going well for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also where you're expanding the </v>

384
00:18:43.731 --> 00:18:47.931
<v Speaker 1>capacity of things to go well for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously and then you can add to </v>

385
00:18:47.931 --> 00:18:51.951
<v Speaker 1>that the fact that that's not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be solipsistic because we live in a </v>

386
00:18:51.951 --> 00:18:51.951
<v Speaker 1>social world.</v>

387
00:18:51.951 --> 00:18:53.760
<v Speaker 1>If I'm pursuing something that's deeply </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful,</v>

388
00:18:53.761 --> 00:18:55.440
<v Speaker 1>then what if?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

389
00:18:55.500 --> 00:19:00.500
<v Speaker 1>if things are constructed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fortunately then I'm going to be </v>

390
00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:04.380
<v Speaker 1>pursuing something that's very good for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me now and me later in knee,</v>

391
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:06.480
<v Speaker 1>deep into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

392
00:19:06.481 --> 00:19:10.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm pursuing something that's good for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you now and you later down deep into the</v>

393
00:19:10.441 --> 00:19:13.830
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I believe that that sense of of deep</v>

394
00:19:13.831 --> 00:19:18.831
<v Speaker 1>engagement that helps people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>fortunate periods of their lives is </v>

395
00:19:18.831 --> 00:19:22.221
<v Speaker 1>actually a neurological signals that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the layers of being are stacked on </v>

396
00:19:22.861 --> 00:19:27.861
<v Speaker 1>top of one another properly and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're oriented properly within the and </v>

397
00:19:27.861 --> 00:19:29.850
<v Speaker 1>that it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a c to me,</v>

398
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:35.390
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've often thought that the most real </v>

399
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.390
<v Speaker 1>thing is paid and then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

400
00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:40.460
<v Speaker 1>if there's an antidote to pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be something that would be </v>

401
00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.311
<v Speaker 1>even more real than paint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me that the sense of </v>

402
00:19:43.311 --> 00:19:44.910
<v Speaker 1>meaning that I'm talking about pure </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's associated with this,</v>

403
00:19:44.911 --> 00:19:49.911
<v Speaker 1>with this sense of ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility is an antidote to paint </v>

404
00:19:49.911 --> 00:19:50.340
<v Speaker 1>and therefore it's something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

405
00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:55.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't see anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make a metaphysical claim about </v>

406
00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:56.580
<v Speaker 1>that and that's perfectly reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have to.</v>

407
00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:01.730
<v Speaker 1>You can make a bloody hardcore </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific claims for that and I think </v>

408
00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:01.890
<v Speaker 1>it's extremely difficult to refute</v>

409
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:07.730
<v Speaker 2>why you have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tend to agree with that and I think </v>

410
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:07.730
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

411
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:11.551
<v Speaker 2>you referencing the the flow state and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something that where we are </v>

412
00:20:11.551 --> 00:20:15.691
<v Speaker 2>happiest right from scientific research </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that flow state and that flow </v>

413
00:20:15.691 --> 00:20:16.360
<v Speaker 2>state is exactly what we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about now.</v>

414
00:20:16.361 --> 00:20:21.361
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this feeling that you have mastery over </v>

415
00:20:21.361 --> 00:20:23.941
<v Speaker 2>your capacity to explore the unexplored </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that the unexplored is worth is </v>

416
00:20:23.941 --> 00:20:23.941
<v Speaker 2>worth exploring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

417
00:20:23.941 --> 00:20:28.491
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the other thing is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>what drives you to to explore the </v>

418
00:20:28.491 --> 00:20:32.101
<v Speaker 2>unexplored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just that you get up in the </v>

419
00:20:32.101 --> 00:20:32.101
<v Speaker 2>morning and you feel like laundering </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside into the forest.</v>

420
00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:37.200
<v Speaker 2>There's some of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think some of it is that you feel </v>

421
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:37.200
<v Speaker 2>like there's a natural necessity for you</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a human being to do that.</v>

422
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:41.401
<v Speaker 2>There's a moral duty for you to try and </v>
<v Speaker 2>conquer new worlds and adding the moral </v>

423
00:20:41.401 --> 00:20:41.401
<v Speaker 2>layer.</v>

424
00:20:41.401 --> 00:20:44.840
<v Speaker 2>More of the moral impetus on top of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just have a decision to,</v>

425
00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:50.090
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go out and explore territory is what </v>

426
00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:51.940
<v Speaker 2>I think allows civilization to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to create rather than destroy,</v>

427
00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.870
<v Speaker 2>and I've talked a lot on my show about a</v>
<v Speaker 2>male male toxicity.</v>

428
00:20:55.871 --> 00:21:00.871
<v Speaker 2>You know what people have to the toxic </v>
<v Speaker 2>masculinity and all this knowledge and </v>

429
00:21:00.871 --> 00:21:02.110
<v Speaker 2>and what what and what not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The binary nature,</v>

430
00:21:02.111 --> 00:21:03.970
<v Speaker 2>I think of human beings particularly </v>
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>

431
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:08.260
<v Speaker 2>is that men have a little boy who's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>year and a half old and he's either.</v>

432
00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:13.320
<v Speaker 2>He's either building a stack of blocks </v>
<v Speaker 2>where he's destroying the stack of </v>

433
00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.361
<v Speaker 2>blocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no in between and so if you </v>

434
00:21:15.361 --> 00:21:17.671
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're exploring unexplored </v>

435
00:21:17.671 --> 00:21:19.321
<v Speaker 2>territory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are only two ways to deal with </v>

436
00:21:19.321 --> 00:21:20.581
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is to actually take a fire and set </v>

437
00:21:20.581 --> 00:21:22.381
<v Speaker 2>it in the unexplored territory or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other is to cultivate that unexplored </v>

438
00:21:22.381 --> 00:21:25.921
<v Speaker 2>territory and adding that moral layer of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's your job to forge out into the </v>

439
00:21:25.921 --> 00:21:27.310
<v Speaker 2>universe and make that cultivated toward</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards.</v>

440
00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:32.320
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bring that into the known that a adding </v>

441
00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.071
<v Speaker 2>that moral dimension is I think what </v>
<v Speaker 2>both the Greeks and Judeo Christian </v>

442
00:21:35.071 --> 00:21:37.540
<v Speaker 2>tradition are about and I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>more frequent Judeo Christian,</v>

443
00:21:37.541 --> 00:21:42.541
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that there is a god worth </v>
<v Speaker 2>exploring and that God has reached down </v>

444
00:21:42.541 --> 00:21:45.991
<v Speaker 2>demand and uplifted him is is I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>relevant to jail Christian religion and </v>

445
00:21:45.991 --> 00:21:47.260
<v Speaker 2>is really the essence of Judaeo </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian religion.</v>

446
00:21:47.261 --> 00:21:50.410
<v Speaker 2>If you look at polytheism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that notion that you're out there to try</v>

447
00:21:50.411 --> 00:21:51.700
<v Speaker 2>and understand God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>

448
00:21:51.701 --> 00:21:53.350
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't exist in polytheistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>

449
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:56.680
<v Speaker 2>The notion that you're supposed to look </v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond your.</v>

450
00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:01.730
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to look beyond yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a broader understanding of the </v>

451
00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:04.141
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know you were subject to forces in the </v>

452
00:22:04.141 --> 00:22:04.141
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

453
00:22:04.141 --> 00:22:04.141
<v Speaker 2>and those were represented by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>different Gods,</v>

454
00:22:04.141 --> 00:22:08.310
<v Speaker 2>not this idea that there's a universal </v>
<v Speaker 2>system that's that's at least partially </v>

455
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:11.551
<v Speaker 2>knowable that if you spend your life </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to investigate and live in </v>

456
00:22:11.551 --> 00:22:13.000
<v Speaker 2>continents with you will be happier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot closer to the Greek system,</v>

457
00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:18.180
<v Speaker 2>which is why you ended up with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>common idea of the logos that you talk </v>

458
00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:21.061
<v Speaker 2>about being in the book of John,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also really springing from from </v>

459
00:22:21.061 --> 00:22:21.061
<v Speaker 2>Greek thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>

460
00:22:21.061 --> 00:22:21.061
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the idea there,</v>

461
00:22:21.061 --> 00:22:21.061
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

462
00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:21.690
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

463
00:22:21.691 --> 00:22:22.200
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

464
00:22:22.201 --> 00:22:24.150
<v Speaker 1>It's an unbelievably brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 1>synthesis.</v>

465
00:22:24.151 --> 00:22:24.900
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

466
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:27.450
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you touched on the idea of cultivation,</v>

467
00:22:27.451 --> 00:22:32.451
<v Speaker 1>so I wanted to ask you both dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to Amsterdam to talk to this </v>

468
00:22:32.451 --> 00:22:34.960
<v Speaker 1>event at this event sponsored by a group</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the Dutch law and,</v>

469
00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:39.970
<v Speaker 1>and that's going to happen to seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>January 19th and go got about 2000 </v>

470
00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:44.151
<v Speaker 1>people attending this event and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>scoring to be a national discussion </v>

471
00:22:44.151 --> 00:22:46.470
<v Speaker 1>about a Datsun European identity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration.</v>

472
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:51.950
<v Speaker 1>And so in principle it can be a big deal</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things I've been </v>

473
00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:55.410
<v Speaker 1>meditating on is what it is that Western</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization got right.</v>

474
00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:59.580
<v Speaker 1>And so the first thing I think is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we got the idea of the logos,</v>

475
00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:04.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal to sovereignty of the </v>

476
00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:06.450
<v Speaker 1>individual and the sovereignty and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity for respect of the capacity of</v>

477
00:23:06.451 --> 00:23:11.250
<v Speaker 1>the exploring individual to conquer new </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory and make it habitable.</v>

478
00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.640
<v Speaker 1>We got that right and so and and I mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>

479
00:23:14.641 --> 00:23:19.641
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then that seems also to me to tie </v>

480
00:23:19.641 --> 00:23:22.551
<v Speaker 1>interestingly into the idea of property </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights because the fundamental Marx's </v>

481
00:23:22.551 --> 00:23:23.220
<v Speaker 1>claim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a number of them,</v>

482
00:23:23.221 --> 00:23:28.221
<v Speaker 1>but one of the most fundamental claims </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that property is in some sense fast </v>

483
00:23:28.221 --> 00:23:32.990
<v Speaker 1>and so that might even mean the property</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you accrued as a consequence of </v>

484
00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:35.670
<v Speaker 1>being successful and I think it might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>worth giving the devil his due and say,</v>

485
00:23:35.671 --> 00:23:40.671
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are there conditions under which my </v>

486
00:23:40.671 --> 00:23:44.070
<v Speaker 1>occupation of a space to the exclusion </v>
<v Speaker 1>of you isn't merely theft?</v>

487
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.500
<v Speaker 1>And the idea cultivation I think is </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the right answer to that is that</v>

488
00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:53.860
<v Speaker 1>the point is for each of us to allow the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other to occupy a particular place in </v>

489
00:23:55.521 --> 00:24:00.521
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the hopes that we'll each take care </v>

490
00:24:00.521 --> 00:24:00.770
<v Speaker 1>of it for our own benefit and for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit of others.</v>

491
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:03.110
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens is that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>wins.</v>

492
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:09.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is a very obviously lockean </v>

493
00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:09.160
<v Speaker 2>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

494
00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.730
<v Speaker 2>This idea of what makes property </v>
<v Speaker 2>worthwhile and property rights </v>

495
00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:12.410
<v Speaker 2>worthwhile as you mix your labor with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the land and you cultivated it,</v>

496
00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:16.130
<v Speaker 2>which is why lot specifically talks </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the notion of adverse possession,</v>

497
00:24:16.131 --> 00:24:21.131
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I own a piece of property and I just </v>

498
00:24:21.131 --> 00:24:22.040
<v Speaker 2>decided to leave it trashed somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then someone comes in and cultivates</v>

499
00:24:22.041 --> 00:24:23.810
<v Speaker 2>the property,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though I own the property,</v>

500
00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.510
<v Speaker 2>I should have a good legal case to </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually make against that owner because</v>

501
00:24:26.511 --> 00:24:31.511
<v Speaker 2>I'm not cultivating the property.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea being that cultivation and use </v>

502
00:24:31.511 --> 00:24:32.390
<v Speaker 2>of the land is actually your individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>duty.</v>

503
00:24:32.391 --> 00:24:34.340
<v Speaker 2>It's your individual duty and it's also </v>
<v Speaker 2>your communal duty.</v>

504
00:24:34.341 --> 00:24:39.341
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the moral legitimacy of </v>

505
00:24:39.341 --> 00:24:39.341
<v Speaker 2>property rights is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

506
00:24:39.341 --> 00:24:43.820
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in locks thought particularly is very </v>

507
00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:46.020
<v Speaker 2>much tied to cultivation and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal stake in what you've done with,</v>

508
00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.170
<v Speaker 2>with the property that you own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

509
00:24:48.171 --> 00:24:50.570
<v Speaker 2>it's exactly your point that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mix of rights and duties.</v>

510
00:24:50.571 --> 00:24:53.160
<v Speaker 2>Property rights are linked to duties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just property own.</v>

511
00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe we can close with this.</v>

512
00:24:55.801 --> 00:24:56.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

513
00:24:56.670 --> 00:25:01.670
<v Speaker 1>the idea of a garden was very </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting to me and of course the </v>

514
00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:03.750
<v Speaker 1>natural environment of the human being </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the garden according to Genesis,</v>

515
00:25:03.751 --> 00:25:08.751
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the garden of Eden and I thought </v>

516
00:25:08.751 --> 00:25:08.751
<v Speaker 1>for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

517
00:25:08.751 --> 00:25:11.361
<v Speaker 1>why is it a garden?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is that a garden </v>

518
00:25:11.361 --> 00:25:13.320
<v Speaker 1>is the optimal juxtaposition of nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>and culture,</v>

519
00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:18.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a garden is nature blooming of its </v>

520
00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.261
<v Speaker 1>own accord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but tended very carefully and so then </v>

521
00:25:21.261 --> 00:25:22.260
<v Speaker 1>the rule would be something like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to,</v>

522
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:26.340
<v Speaker 1>you're allowed to own something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the right to own something,</v>

523
00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:31.370
<v Speaker 1>you have the privilege to own something </v>
<v Speaker 1>if what you're doing is transforming </v>

524
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:31.370
<v Speaker 1>into a bountiful garden.</v>

525
00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:37.460
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's true and I think that's </v>

526
00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:37.460
<v Speaker 2>true in every area of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a successful life.</v>

527
00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:38.580
<v Speaker 2>It's true how you raise your children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

528
00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.800
<v Speaker 2>you lose the right to raise your </v>
<v Speaker 2>children properly if you're raising your</v>

529
00:25:40.801 --> 00:25:42.840
<v Speaker 2>children improperly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's true of marriage.</v>

530
00:25:42.841 --> 00:25:44.370
<v Speaker 2>Marriages break down when you don't call</v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

531
00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:45.920
<v Speaker 2>and cultivation is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

532
00:25:45.921 --> 00:25:49.470
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate human need is cultivation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when we cultivate,</v>

533
00:25:49.471 --> 00:25:54.471
<v Speaker 2>whether it's in the realm of knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 2>or science or whether it's in the realm </v>

534
00:25:54.471 --> 00:25:57.230
<v Speaker 2>of religion and relationships than we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are happier and when we don't cultivate </v>

535
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:57.230
<v Speaker 2>and we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

536
00:25:57.230 --> 00:26:01.540
<v Speaker 2>when we deprive ourselves of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity and both the capacity and the </v>

537
00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:04.380
<v Speaker 2>purpose of cultivation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then everything falls into anarchy then.</v>

538
00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:06.360
<v Speaker 2>Then just through entropy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything will fall apart I think.</v>

539
00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:11.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the right objection to privileges </v>

540
00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:14.040
<v Speaker 1>cultivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like I'm not privileged on </v>

541
00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:14.040
<v Speaker 1>cultivating.</v>

542
00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:14.140
<v Speaker 2>I liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked that a lot.</v>

543
00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's necessary to get to grip these </v>

544
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:19.200
<v Speaker 1>things by the neck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

545
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:19.570
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

546
00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:20.650
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well look,</v>

547
00:26:20.651 --> 00:26:25.651
<v Speaker 1>thanks very much for talking to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope we get a chance to talk again in </v>

548
00:26:25.651 --> 00:26:26.260
<v Speaker 1>the relatively near future because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some things we could really sort</v>

549
00:26:26.261 --> 00:26:26.860
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

550
00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:28.630
<v Speaker 2>that'd be great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd really appreciate it.</v>

551
00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm big fan of your work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously.</v>

552
00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phoenix mutual.</v>

553
00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:34.740
<v Speaker 1>Thanks so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good talking to you.</v>

554
00:26:34.741 --> 00:26:35.580
<v Speaker 1>Happy New Year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

555
00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:38.280
<v Speaker 1>You too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bye.</v>

556
00:26:38.281 --> 00:26:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Bye.</v>
