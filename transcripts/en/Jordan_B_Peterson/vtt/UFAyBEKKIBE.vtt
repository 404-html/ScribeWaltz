1
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.870
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.760
<v Speaker 1>we've been talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>a code of representations in some sense</v>

3
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.383
<v Speaker 1>of symbolic representation and I've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to guide you through some </v>

4
00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:22.454
<v Speaker 1>developing understanding of that code of</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolic representation so that as we </v>

5
00:00:25.641 --> 00:00:26.474
<v Speaker 1>progress through the course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have the ground rules in some </v>

6
00:00:30.201 --> 00:00:33.470
<v Speaker 1>sense for interpreting all the different</v>
<v Speaker 1>theories that we encounter.</v>

7
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.380
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to continue that today.</v>

8
00:00:36.381 --> 00:00:37.214
<v Speaker 1>This is the last lecture on sort of pre </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic conceptions of </v>

9
00:00:40.761 --> 00:00:41.594
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we moved to piaget and then to </v>

10
00:00:45.051 --> 00:00:45.950
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

11
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:49.773
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I tried to point out to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you was that social primates like us </v>

12
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.820
<v Speaker 1>likely have a cognitive structure that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on social categories.</v>

13
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.380
<v Speaker 1>And that when our cognitive systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>elaborate it up enough to start thinking</v>

14
00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:06.460
<v Speaker 1>about the world in more abstract terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond our immediate environment,</v>

15
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.560
<v Speaker 1>there's a high probability that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned,</v>

16
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.620
<v Speaker 1>we used the same cognitive structures </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had evolved to begin the process of</v>

17
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.963
<v Speaker 1>abstract conceptualization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in some sense you could say we </v>

18
00:01:18.491 --> 00:01:19.324
<v Speaker 1>used our knowledge of personality to </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to understand the external world </v>

19
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.340
<v Speaker 1>based on the initial axiomatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumption.</v>

20
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:28.563
<v Speaker 1>It's not a cognitive assumption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a perceptual assumption that the </v>

21
00:01:32.081 --> 00:01:35.470
<v Speaker 1>world was like a personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we do this automatically.</v>

22
00:01:35.471 --> 00:01:38.170
<v Speaker 1>So I want to show you a little video </v>
<v Speaker 1>here that's quite a famous video.</v>

23
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shows you how easily you can abstract</v>

24
00:01:42.071 --> 00:01:46.450
<v Speaker 1>out and narrative from the most abstract</v>
<v Speaker 1>of events.</v>

25
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.110
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So watch what happens.</v>

26
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.953
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

27
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.680
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's watch that one more time.</v>

28
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.300
<v Speaker 1>So it's something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll go over it again.</v>

29
00:02:21.301 --> 00:02:22.134
<v Speaker 1>It's something like the little circle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poor little circle is trying to </v>

30
00:02:25.021 --> 00:02:25.854
<v Speaker 1>escape and when it does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bad gray triangle comes up and sort </v>

31
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:28.764
<v Speaker 1>of steals it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then a blue triangle has a little </v>

32
00:02:30.841 --> 00:02:33.550
<v Speaker 1>scrap with the gray triangle and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

33
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.930
<v Speaker 1>puts the little yellow or the little </v>
<v Speaker 1>circle back into its safe and closure.</v>

34
00:02:36.931 --> 00:02:38.560
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>

35
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.563
<v Speaker 1>the reason that that demonstration was </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed was to indicate or two and </v>

36
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:46.710
<v Speaker 1>also to task how little information you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really needed,</v>

37
00:02:46.711 --> 00:02:51.690
<v Speaker 1>how low resolution the information was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you needed in order to perceive,</v>

38
00:02:51.691 --> 00:02:54.150
<v Speaker 1>to directly perceive something that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a narrative.</v>

39
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.201
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:02:55.201 --> 00:02:57.600
<v Speaker 1>and that's a relatively complicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative.</v>

41
00:02:57.601 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 1>All things considered for a square at </v>
<v Speaker 1>two triangles.</v>

42
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 1>And a circle interacting for maybe three</v>
<v Speaker 1>or four seconds.</v>

43
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:05.240
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

44
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.163
<v Speaker 1>the point of this demonstration is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicate just exactly how prepared you </v>

45
00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 1>are to read the world in narrative </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms.</v>

46
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.503
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

47
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.540
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

48
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.373
<v Speaker 1>Laurie,</v>

49
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.193
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

50
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.530
<v Speaker 1>Now I had talked to you about these </v>
<v Speaker 1>figures before and I was trying to make,</v>

51
00:03:24.531 --> 00:03:25.364
<v Speaker 1>so here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's kind of an overview of what I'm </v>

52
00:03:27.051 --> 00:03:29.330
<v Speaker 1>attempting to describe to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the one,</v>

53
00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:30.613
<v Speaker 1>there's one category of representation </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has to do with the territory that </v>

54
00:03:32.991 --> 00:03:37.490
<v Speaker 1>you inhabit and that you understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's primarily social territory and it</v>

55
00:03:37.491 --> 00:03:42.380
<v Speaker 1>tends to be symbolized by masculine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually like older male symbols.</v>

56
00:03:42.381 --> 00:03:45.370
<v Speaker 1>So that's the patriarchal structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think what it is is a,</v>

57
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.720
<v Speaker 1>it's a personified representation of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy structure.</v>

58
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.100
<v Speaker 1>So if remember the lion king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the pride rock thing.</v>

59
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.680
<v Speaker 1>So the pride rock is sort of associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

60
00:03:57.681 --> 00:04:00.590
<v Speaker 1>with the symbols father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>

61
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.770
<v Speaker 1>that's that category of symbol is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbol that I'm talking about.</v>

62
00:04:03.771 --> 00:04:04.604
<v Speaker 1>So he used that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that high place on a mountain as an </v>

63
00:04:06.801 --> 00:04:09.080
<v Speaker 1>indicator of dominance structure.</v>

64
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.500
<v Speaker 1>You saw that at the opening of the lion </v>
<v Speaker 1>king movie where all the animals come,</v>

65
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.070
<v Speaker 1>they gather around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all bow before the,</v>

66
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.750
<v Speaker 1>the rock with the king on top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the king,</v>

67
00:04:17.751 --> 00:04:18.584
<v Speaker 1>like the lion is a symbol generally a </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbol of something like solar power </v>

68
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.873
<v Speaker 1>because the lion is a top Predator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's apex Predator and it lives in </v>

69
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Africa under the sun and it has a main,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of like a son.</v>

70
00:04:29.271 --> 00:04:30.104
<v Speaker 1>And then later in the lion king will </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually see this today you'll see the </v>

71
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.860
<v Speaker 1>father lion who fossa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

72
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.020
<v Speaker 1>he appears in the sky with a solar halo </v>
<v Speaker 1>around him.</v>

73
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.700
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's the masculine category.</v>

74
00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:48.020
<v Speaker 1>And then the feminine category I told </v>
<v Speaker 1>you a little about a bit about is a more</v>

75
00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:48.854
<v Speaker 1>chaotic category and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a chaotic and plastic category out </v>

76
00:04:52.671 --> 00:04:54.320
<v Speaker 1>of which new forms emerge.</v>

77
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:55.543
<v Speaker 1>And then one of the categories that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't talked about is the category of </v>

78
00:04:58.101 --> 00:04:58.934
<v Speaker 1>the individual and the individual is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hero and hero stories and is the </v>

79
00:05:02.181 --> 00:05:03.014
<v Speaker 1>initiate and initiatory routines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the hero is the person who is </v>

80
00:05:07.191 --> 00:05:08.024
<v Speaker 1>attempting to become a complete </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological and historical entity </v>

81
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.190
<v Speaker 1>personality so that they're capable not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only of,</v>

82
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.050
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of um,</v>

83
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:19.813
<v Speaker 1>adopting independent existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if adopting independent existence </v>

84
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.223
<v Speaker 1>that's productive and that's productive </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way that's also a benefit to the </v>

85
00:05:27.591 --> 00:05:28.424
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a particular pattern of </v>

86
00:05:30.111 --> 00:05:30.944
<v Speaker 1>development and that that needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>catalyzed by human societies because in </v>

87
00:05:35.301 --> 00:05:36.134
<v Speaker 1>order for a society to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to maintain its structure and for the </v>

88
00:05:39.531 --> 00:05:40.364
<v Speaker 1>people within it to thrive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the developing individuals have to </v>

89
00:05:43.521 --> 00:05:46.790
<v Speaker 1>mature to the point where they can take </v>
<v Speaker 1>care of themselves in a way that doesn't</v>

90
00:05:46.791 --> 00:05:50.000
<v Speaker 1>disrupt the whole social structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the path.</v>

91
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.390
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural path for human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say to some degree because we're</v>

92
00:05:53.391 --> 00:05:54.224
<v Speaker 1>such intensely social creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because we're also quite malleable </v>

93
00:05:57.831 --> 00:06:01.640
<v Speaker 1>and complex and also grounded in history</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cultural creatures,</v>

94
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:02.623
<v Speaker 1>it's also something that has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>taught both from the perspective of </v>

95
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:09.740
<v Speaker 1>invitation and explicitly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of initiation rights,</v>

96
00:06:09.741 --> 00:06:12.590
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are predicated on the idea that you take</v>

97
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:15.380
<v Speaker 1>the person out of their childhood </v>
<v Speaker 1>context,</v>

98
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.720
<v Speaker 1>you destroy their personality usually as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a consequence of some cause,</v>

99
00:06:19.721 --> 00:06:20.554
<v Speaker 1>a traumatic encounter and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>refill them with the cultural norms and </v>

100
00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:27.260
<v Speaker 1>that makes them an adult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

101
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:28.094
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to some degree that's what you guys are </v>

102
00:06:29.091 --> 00:06:29.924
<v Speaker 1>doing in a very slow way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you make the transition from high </v>

103
00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:35.510
<v Speaker 1>school say to university or that </v>
<v Speaker 1>transition from high school to a,</v>

104
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.460
<v Speaker 1>to a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't,</v>

105
00:06:37.461 --> 00:06:38.294
<v Speaker 1>in our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have the kind of abrupt </v>

106
00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:43.130
<v Speaker 1>ceremonies though that are designed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>catalyze that transformation.</v>

107
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.990
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's an okay thing and,</v>

108
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:46.423
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe it's not an okay thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean one of the things that Freud </v>

109
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:51.080
<v Speaker 1>pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's absolutely right about this,</v>

110
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.180
<v Speaker 1>is that because human beings have such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long dependency period,</v>

111
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.103
<v Speaker 1>it's not that easy for us to grow up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes it takes a shock in order </v>

112
00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:01.454
<v Speaker 1>for that to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the potential problems </v>

113
00:07:04.731 --> 00:07:05.564
<v Speaker 1>with having a dependency period as long </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the human dependency period is that </v>

114
00:07:09.051 --> 00:07:13.610
<v Speaker 1>it never ends and that you stay immature</v>
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

115
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.713
<v Speaker 1>And really I believe that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>central old problem that Freud talked </v>

116
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:19.514
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I believe also that it's a real </v>

117
00:07:20.301 --> 00:07:22.880
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now whether Freud formulated it,</v>

118
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with precise accuracy,</v>

119
00:07:24.771 --> 00:07:26.300
<v Speaker 1>that's a different story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

120
00:07:26.301 --> 00:07:29.060
<v Speaker 1>you've got to give the guy a break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least he formulated and it,</v>

121
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:29.923
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was much more impressed with </v>

122
00:07:32.271 --> 00:07:33.104
<v Speaker 1>Freud and eda pull theorizing after I </v>
<v Speaker 1>did clinical work for a long time </v>

123
00:07:36.051 --> 00:07:36.884
<v Speaker 1>because a large number of my patients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their primary problem is getting the </v>

124
00:07:39.981 --> 00:07:41.390
<v Speaker 1>hell out of their family.</v>

125
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.680
<v Speaker 1>They just can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for them the world is the family.</v>

126
00:07:45.681 --> 00:07:48.650
<v Speaker 1>It's the only thing that matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's often parental opinion or something</v>

127
00:07:48.651 --> 00:07:50.660
<v Speaker 1>like that and they just cannot break </v>
<v Speaker 1>free of it.</v>

128
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:51.913
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>initiation ceremonies in part were </v>

129
00:07:53.991 --> 00:07:57.620
<v Speaker 1>designed to catalyze that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that break so that your,</v>

130
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.530
<v Speaker 1>your mother in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also your father to some degree,</v>

131
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.820
<v Speaker 1>we're no longer the dominant figures of </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced your,</v>

132
00:08:04.821 --> 00:08:08.060
<v Speaker 1>your personal mother and father were no </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer the dominant figures of influence</v>

133
00:08:08.061 --> 00:08:08.894
<v Speaker 1>in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because really that's what he </v>

134
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.650
<v Speaker 1>maturation means in some sense is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you become an adult,</v>

135
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:16.693
<v Speaker 1>the opinions of your parents are as </v>
<v Speaker 1>important as the opinions of any other </v>

136
00:08:20.751 --> 00:08:23.390
<v Speaker 1>reasonable people that hypothetically </v>
<v Speaker 1>care for you.</v>

137
00:08:23.391 --> 00:08:26.030
<v Speaker 1>But no more important than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

138
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:28.093
<v Speaker 1>and I told you about some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolic associations that that gather </v>

139
00:08:30.981 --> 00:08:33.350
<v Speaker 1>around say images of the unknown.</v>

140
00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:36.230
<v Speaker 1>You could also think of the unknown as </v>
<v Speaker 1>unexplored territory.</v>

141
00:08:36.231 --> 00:08:37.064
<v Speaker 1>But it's a tricky kind of territory </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if the person beside you does </v>

142
00:08:40.221 --> 00:08:41.054
<v Speaker 1>something spectacularly weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you move from explored territory to </v>

143
00:08:44.811 --> 00:08:47.960
<v Speaker 1>unexplored territory as soon as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't understand what they're doing.</v>

144
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.990
<v Speaker 1>So it's not exactly spacial temper </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

145
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.033
<v Speaker 1>It's more like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more like temporal spacial </v>

146
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.733
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's time and space because the same </v>

147
00:08:57.841 --> 00:09:00.840
<v Speaker 1>place can be a different place from one </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment to the next.</v>

148
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:01.833
<v Speaker 1>Now it happens all the time when some </v>
<v Speaker 1>event that you don't expect occurs in </v>

149
00:09:05.251 --> 00:09:10.251
<v Speaker 1>the place that you are so and your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>is prepared to react,</v>

150
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.970
<v Speaker 1>it's instinctively prepared to react to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the emergence of chaotic circumstances.</v>

151
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:15.804
<v Speaker 1>It basically does that by hyper </v>
<v Speaker 1>activating your preparation for action </v>

152
00:09:19.241 --> 00:09:23.370
<v Speaker 1>and increasing your capacity to pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention and preparing you to do a very</v>

153
00:09:23.371 --> 00:09:26.310
<v Speaker 1>large number of things at once because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what to do.</v>

154
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.100
<v Speaker 1>It's a high stress reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's built into you.</v>

155
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:29.963
<v Speaker 1>And it's so interesting because what </v>
<v Speaker 1>that means that is part of what's built </v>

156
00:09:32.581 --> 00:09:35.550
<v Speaker 1>into people is the ability to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they don't understand,</v>

157
00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.050
<v Speaker 1>which is a real paradox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

158
00:09:37.051 --> 00:09:39.510
<v Speaker 1>Because how can you deal with what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't understand?</v>

159
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.910
<v Speaker 1>You don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

160
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.260
<v Speaker 1>but the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

161
00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.113
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ramp up your ability to react in a </v>

162
00:09:46.771 --> 00:09:50.400
<v Speaker 1>very large number of ways and you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that by increasing your general level of</v>

163
00:09:50.401 --> 00:09:52.860
<v Speaker 1>arousal and your attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a good,</v>

164
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:53.903
<v Speaker 1>that also increases the probability that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be attentive to new </v>

165
00:09:56.851 --> 00:09:57.684
<v Speaker 1>information and pull it in and utilize </v>
<v Speaker 1>it so that you can decide how to act </v>

166
00:10:00.541 --> 00:10:03.750
<v Speaker 1>rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So other things happen.</v>

167
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.430
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

168
00:10:05.431 --> 00:10:06.264
<v Speaker 1>some of you may have been in car </v>
<v Speaker 1>accidents or events like that where you </v>

169
00:10:08.821 --> 00:10:13.821
<v Speaker 1>knew for a few seconds that the event </v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to occur and time slowed down.</v>

170
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.910
<v Speaker 1>It's quite a common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

171
00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:16.773
<v Speaker 1>commonly reported phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've experienced it a number of times </v>

172
00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:20.280
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

173
00:10:20.281 --> 00:10:23.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was actually experimentally tested.</v>

174
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:24.863
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

175
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.130
<v Speaker 1>threw people off Bungee cord </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparatuses,</v>

176
00:10:29.131 --> 00:10:30.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so apparatuses,</v>

177
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.730
<v Speaker 1>so they were plummeting down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

178
00:10:32.731 --> 00:10:33.564
<v Speaker 1>in a quite frightening manner and had </v>
<v Speaker 1>them look at digital timers that were </v>

179
00:10:35.791 --> 00:10:38.310
<v Speaker 1>flashing information while they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>falling.</v>

180
00:10:38.311 --> 00:10:39.144
<v Speaker 1>And it turned out that the people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are falling could process the digital </v>

181
00:10:41.731 --> 00:10:42.564
<v Speaker 1>information faster than people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>just standing there under normal </v>

182
00:10:45.751 --> 00:10:47.760
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How they got that passed.</v>

183
00:10:47.761 --> 00:10:49.320
<v Speaker 1>An ethics committee is beyond me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

184
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.200
<v Speaker 1>but it's a brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really is a brilliant experiment.</v>

185
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:56.190
<v Speaker 1>So I went through some of the symbolism </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the unknown.</v>

186
00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:57.323
<v Speaker 1>I want to go through some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolism that's associated with the </v>

187
00:10:59.671 --> 00:11:01.770
<v Speaker 1>known today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So give you some sense.</v>

188
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.940
<v Speaker 1>Flags are definitely patriarchal symbols</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

189
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:06.180
<v Speaker 1>Their cultural symbols.</v>

190
00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:09.390
<v Speaker 1>And here's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just lay out a variety of terms.</v>

191
00:11:09.391 --> 00:11:10.224
<v Speaker 1>And so that'll give you some indication </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the network of associations that's </v>

192
00:11:13.621 --> 00:11:17.280
<v Speaker 1>associated with the symbol of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy.</v>

193
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:21.330
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apple Linnaean control.</v>

194
00:11:21.331 --> 00:11:24.690
<v Speaker 1>That's after Apollo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the god Super Ego,</v>

195
00:11:24.691 --> 00:11:25.860
<v Speaker 1>the conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the king,</v>

196
00:11:25.861 --> 00:11:27.450
<v Speaker 1>the patriarch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the plow.</v>

197
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.433
<v Speaker 1>Cause the plow opens up the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fellas order and authority and the </v>

198
00:11:32.011 --> 00:11:36.660
<v Speaker 1>crushing weight of tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wise old man and the tyrant dogma,</v>

199
00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.460
<v Speaker 1>the day sky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country man,</v>

200
00:11:38.461 --> 00:11:39.480
<v Speaker 1>the island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heights,</v>

201
00:11:39.481 --> 00:11:42.720
<v Speaker 1>the ancestral spirits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the activity of the dead.</v>

202
00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Now these symbolic realms or are kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

203
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:51.250
<v Speaker 1>there's there</v>
<v Speaker 1>situationally transformable.</v>

204
00:11:51.721 --> 00:11:55.420
<v Speaker 1>So if you look across very frequently in</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>

205
00:11:55.421 --> 00:11:58.570
<v Speaker 1>you see characters that exemplify each </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these categories,</v>

206
00:11:58.571 --> 00:12:01.510
<v Speaker 1>but the characters can shift to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>

207
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.380
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so often if the story involves the ocean</v>

208
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:09.370
<v Speaker 1>and an island than the ocean will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine in Ireland will be masculine.</v>

209
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:13.630
<v Speaker 1>But if the story utilizes an island and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the air,</v>

210
00:12:13.631 --> 00:12:16.390
<v Speaker 1>then the island will be feminine and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the air will be masculine.</v>

211
00:12:16.391 --> 00:12:17.224
<v Speaker 1>So it isn't as if there's a one to one </v>
<v Speaker 1>correspondence between the entities in </v>

212
00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:22.984
<v Speaker 1>the story and these archetipal </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories because their definition </v>

213
00:12:26.201 --> 00:12:29.410
<v Speaker 1>depends on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't be defined in isolation.</v>

214
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.000
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

215
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.880
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like does this really </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid example,</v>

216
00:12:33.881 --> 00:12:35.530
<v Speaker 1>but it's the best one I can come up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the moment.</v>

217
00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:37.690
<v Speaker 1>If you're trying to interpret </v>
<v Speaker 1>statistics,</v>

218
00:12:37.691 --> 00:12:38.524
<v Speaker 1>you can't understand what a given </v>
<v Speaker 1>statistic means unless you know the </v>

219
00:12:41.141 --> 00:12:45.040
<v Speaker 1>number of people in the experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the effect size and the probability that</v>

220
00:12:45.041 --> 00:12:49.510
<v Speaker 1>that affects size is that at emerged at </v>
<v Speaker 1>a better than chance level.</v>

221
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:50.993
<v Speaker 1>Any of those pieces of information </v>
<v Speaker 1>without the other two are actually </v>

222
00:12:53.861 --> 00:12:56.650
<v Speaker 1>meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same situation here.</v>

223
00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:57.663
<v Speaker 1>You have to have the representation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and you have to have the </v>

224
00:12:59.591 --> 00:13:00.424
<v Speaker 1>representation of nature and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the representation of the </v>

225
00:13:03.131 --> 00:13:03.970
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

226
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.223
<v Speaker 1>And then you can figure out what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what entities are being used in those </v>

227
00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:09.154
<v Speaker 1>different categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though there's some similarity </v>

228
00:13:10.541 --> 00:13:11.374
<v Speaker 1>across stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is partly why you could actually </v>

229
00:13:13.091 --> 00:13:14.660
<v Speaker 1>understand stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

230
00:13:14.661 --> 00:13:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Because if there was no similarity </v>
<v Speaker 1>across them,</v>

231
00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.340
<v Speaker 1>then you wouldn't be able to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

232
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.300
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

233
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.330
<v Speaker 1>there's some representations of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>great father.</v>

234
00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

235
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.380
<v Speaker 1>the one on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is on the right,</v>

236
00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:30.820
<v Speaker 1>was quite a horrifying image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

237
00:13:30.821 --> 00:13:33.070
<v Speaker 1>and that's a kind of a devouring father </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure.</v>

238
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:34.870
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

239
00:13:34.871 --> 00:13:36.800
<v Speaker 1>here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a way of thinking about that,</v>

240
00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:38.500
<v Speaker 1>which I think is extremely useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

241
00:13:38.501 --> 00:13:39.940
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are in university,</v>

242
00:13:39.941 --> 00:13:41.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

243
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.243
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>university is one of those patriarchal </v>

244
00:13:45.851 --> 00:13:48.880
<v Speaker 1>institution that's gives with one hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>and takes away with another,</v>

245
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:50.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you come here,</v>

246
00:13:50.321 --> 00:13:52.570
<v Speaker 1>there's thousands of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's tens of thousands of view.</v>

247
00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.613
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense as an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're rather faceless and you're also </v>

248
00:13:56.651 --> 00:13:59.740
<v Speaker 1>in some sense at the bottom of the power</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy in the university,</v>

249
00:13:59.741 --> 00:14:01.700
<v Speaker 1>I think more than you should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever you,</v>

250
00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:03.130
<v Speaker 1>you are at the bottom of it.</v>

251
00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.173
<v Speaker 1>And so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a crushing institutional weight </v>

252
00:14:06.461 --> 00:14:09.640
<v Speaker 1>that comes along with being part of such</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big university in particular.</v>

253
00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:10.474
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really hard on students in their </v>

254
00:14:11.861 --> 00:14:13.170
<v Speaker 1>first year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

255
00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.013
<v Speaker 1>it's always seemed to me that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>better for first year students to go to </v>

256
00:14:16.271 --> 00:14:20.110
<v Speaker 1>a smaller place where the institutional </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight is not so heavy.</v>

257
00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.273
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tested u of t students in their </v>

258
00:14:23.381 --> 00:14:24.214
<v Speaker 1>first year with things like the Beck </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression inventory and about 30% of u </v>

259
00:14:27.851 --> 00:14:31.330
<v Speaker 1>of t students meet criteria for </v>
<v Speaker 1>hospitalized depression.</v>

260
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:32.771
<v Speaker 1>They do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

261
00:14:32.771 --> 00:14:33.604
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's also because the back is way </v>

262
00:14:34.871 --> 00:14:37.450
<v Speaker 1>more sensitive to that then it should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least that,</v>

263
00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:38.373
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't think its criteria for </v>

264
00:14:40.121 --> 00:14:41.950
<v Speaker 1>when you should be hospitalized are </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable.</v>

265
00:14:41.951 --> 00:14:45.580
<v Speaker 1>But the point is is that the depression </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the anxiety is quite high.</v>

266
00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:46.960
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand,</v>

267
00:14:46.961 --> 00:14:49.210
<v Speaker 1>of course you're benefiting from going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to university.</v>

268
00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:52.310
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the kind of bipolar nature</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the symbol.</v>

269
00:14:52.311 --> 00:14:54.920
<v Speaker 1>It's the tire in town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's benevolent tradition.</v>

270
00:14:54.921 --> 00:14:56.570
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

271
00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:57.463
<v Speaker 1>it's molding you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could even say it's crushing you </v>

272
00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:03.110
<v Speaker 1>because an educational system does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time it's like,</v>

273
00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:05.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you allow yourself to get crushed</v>

274
00:15:05.391 --> 00:15:07.640
<v Speaker 1>by it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get the benefit.</v>

275
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:08.713
<v Speaker 1>And that's the paradoxical relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>that individuals have with culture </v>

276
00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:13.370
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at all time.</v>

277
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:14.653
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without culture you're nothing but with </v>

278
00:15:15.951 --> 00:15:18.830
<v Speaker 1>culture you have to be a cog in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

279
00:15:18.831 --> 00:15:22.880
<v Speaker 1>And so the tension between those two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things is continual and constant.</v>

280
00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:23.714
<v Speaker 1>You could think about it as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>existential constant ever since there's </v>

281
00:15:26.361 --> 00:15:27.194
<v Speaker 1>been complex human societies and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>even when there were only tribal human </v>

282
00:15:30.921 --> 00:15:31.754
<v Speaker 1>societies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been a problem for the </v>

283
00:15:33.381 --> 00:15:35.090
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So culture,</v>

284
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.073
<v Speaker 1>tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dominance hierarchy is a solution </v>

285
00:15:37.401 --> 00:15:40.130
<v Speaker 1>and a problem and nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unknown,</v>

286
00:15:40.131 --> 00:15:43.760
<v Speaker 1>unexplored territory is a solution and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

287
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.950
<v Speaker 1>And then the third category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you see,</v>

288
00:15:45.951 --> 00:15:47.960
<v Speaker 1>I'll just tell you a couple of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>about these images.</v>

289
00:15:47.961 --> 00:15:50.690
<v Speaker 1>So the one in the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the devouring father,</v>

290
00:15:50.691 --> 00:15:51.524
<v Speaker 1>that's also giving birth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense your personalities are </v>

291
00:15:54.471 --> 00:15:58.250
<v Speaker 1>being devoured by the university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time a new personalities</v>

292
00:15:58.251 --> 00:15:59.190
<v Speaker 1>coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

293
00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:00.163
<v Speaker 1>emerging as a consequence of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And hopefully it's a better personality </v>

294
00:16:02.481 --> 00:16:05.690
<v Speaker 1>than the previous one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can tolerate the tension of being</v>

295
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.820
<v Speaker 1>transformed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heat and the pressure,</v>

296
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:09.710
<v Speaker 1>then hopefully you come out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

297
00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:12.050
<v Speaker 1>you come out though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worth it.</v>

298
00:16:12.051 --> 00:16:13.880
<v Speaker 1>The process is worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

299
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:14.953
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see on the left there at the top on </v>

300
00:16:16.921 --> 00:16:17.480
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

301
00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.313
<v Speaker 1>on the right at the top you see a </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture of an old man kissing Joseph </v>

302
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.260
<v Speaker 1>Stalin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite a weird thing to do.</v>

303
00:16:24.261 --> 00:16:27.410
<v Speaker 1>Given that Joseph Stalin was probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for the deaths of,</v>

304
00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.473
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some number of people in excess of 10 </v>

305
00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:31.453
<v Speaker 1>million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps in excess of 30 million people </v>

306
00:16:32.811 --> 00:16:34.160
<v Speaker 1>argue about this all the time.</v>

307
00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:35.173
<v Speaker 1>He certainly starved 6 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ukrainians to death in the 1930s which </v>

308
00:16:38.421 --> 00:16:39.254
<v Speaker 1>is something that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some reason you don't hear much </v>

309
00:16:41.031 --> 00:16:41.864
<v Speaker 1>about your education but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>6 million Ukrainians probably worth </v>

310
00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:45.883
<v Speaker 1>noticing a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter because this old </v>

311
00:16:49.011 --> 00:16:49.844
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was taken after the fall of the </v>

312
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:52.903
<v Speaker 1>Berlin Wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's nostalgic for the times when </v>

313
00:16:54.861 --> 00:16:56.600
<v Speaker 1>everything was certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

314
00:16:56.601 --> 00:16:57.434
<v Speaker 1>and the the gold statue of Stella and </v>
<v Speaker 1>his representation in some sense of a </v>

315
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:03.710
<v Speaker 1>day of five leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the old man is there,</v>

316
00:17:03.711 --> 00:17:04.544
<v Speaker 1>is in a position of worship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Captain Hook there at the </v>

317
00:17:07.101 --> 00:17:07.934
<v Speaker 1>bottom on the right hand side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's quite an interesting character </v>

318
00:17:10.131 --> 00:17:10.964
<v Speaker 1>because he's basically a tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Peter Pan Story is very </v>

319
00:17:13.161 --> 00:17:16.430
<v Speaker 1>interesting because Peter Pan Pan sorta </v>
<v Speaker 1>means everything.</v>

320
00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:21.910
<v Speaker 1>And Peter Pan is the sort of person who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to retain the dynamic potential of</v>

321
00:17:23.901 --> 00:17:24.734
<v Speaker 1>childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when you're a child you're not </v>

322
00:17:26.151 --> 00:17:28.940
<v Speaker 1>anything but you couldn't be anything.</v>

323
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:32.030
<v Speaker 1>So you're pretty much only potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

324
00:17:32.031 --> 00:17:36.410
<v Speaker 1>well why should you sacrifice that </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential to become something actual?</v>

325
00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:39.140
<v Speaker 1>Cause in some sense it's actually a </v>
<v Speaker 1>limiting process.</v>

326
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:40.070
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

327
00:17:40.071 --> 00:17:43.760
<v Speaker 1>and I mean this in the most concrete </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible way,</v>

328
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:45.103
<v Speaker 1>you have more neural connections when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're born than you do at any other </v>

329
00:17:48.591 --> 00:17:51.930
<v Speaker 1>time in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most of those die by the time you're</v>

330
00:17:51.931 --> 00:17:52.764
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you go through this tremendous </v>

331
00:17:54.451 --> 00:17:57.780
<v Speaker 1>pruning process from when you're born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from when,</v>

332
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.440
<v Speaker 1>til two so it's like you're dying into </v>
<v Speaker 1>your childhood personality.</v>

333
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:02.453
<v Speaker 1>And then again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing happens at the end of </v>

334
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:04.374
<v Speaker 1>adolescence between say 16 and 21 which </v>
<v Speaker 1>is also the peak time for risk for the </v>

335
00:18:09.781 --> 00:18:12.570
<v Speaker 1>emergence of schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some people think that's the pruning</v>

336
00:18:12.571 --> 00:18:14.490
<v Speaker 1>process gone wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

337
00:18:14.491 --> 00:18:15.324
<v Speaker 1>as an adolescent you also shed childhood</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential to become the limited but </v>

338
00:18:21.271 --> 00:18:24.660
<v Speaker 1>specialized in potentially useful thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you will become.</v>

339
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:25.980
<v Speaker 1>And so you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

340
00:18:25.981 --> 00:18:28.590
<v Speaker 1>is it worth it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it worth shedding that potential?</v>

341
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:31.470
<v Speaker 1>And Peter Pan's answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

342
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:35.010
<v Speaker 1>he wants to remain in Neverland as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>magical boy forever.</v>

343
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.130
<v Speaker 1>And he's king of the lost boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I would say is not a very,</v>

344
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:39.960
<v Speaker 1>it's not much of a dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

345
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the king,</v>

346
00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:45.240
<v Speaker 1>King of the King of the losers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

347
00:18:45.241 --> 00:18:49.320
<v Speaker 1>People who can't get their act together </v>
<v Speaker 1>and mature now.</v>

348
00:18:49.321 --> 00:18:51.930
<v Speaker 1>And you notice in Peter Pan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peter pan doesn't grow up.</v>

349
00:18:51.931 --> 00:18:56.280
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't establish a relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wendy who's actually real.</v>

350
00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:01.230
<v Speaker 1>He has to settle for Tinkerbell who you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know is a ferry and they don't exist.</v>

351
00:19:01.231 --> 00:19:02.064
<v Speaker 1>And so she's really in some sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure of his imagination because he </v>

352
00:19:05.041 --> 00:19:05.874
<v Speaker 1>won't mature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't have an actual relationship </v>

353
00:19:07.531 --> 00:19:09.060
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a genuine person.</v>

354
00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:13.050
<v Speaker 1>So he has to satisfy himself with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while it's something like a pornographic</v>

355
00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:14.100
<v Speaker 1>fantasy actually.</v>

356
00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.350
<v Speaker 1>So seriously it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is like that.</v>

357
00:19:16.351 --> 00:19:17.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

358
00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:21.270
<v Speaker 1>it's a toned down a lot in the movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>version obviously,</v>

359
00:19:21.271 --> 00:19:22.770
<v Speaker 1>but still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's underlying it.</v>

360
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:23.633
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why doesn't Peter Pan want to grow </v>

361
00:19:25.261 --> 00:19:26.094
<v Speaker 1>up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And answer is the only figure of </v>

362
00:19:27.811 --> 00:19:29.580
<v Speaker 1>authority that's around for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His P,</v>

363
00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:32.160
<v Speaker 1>his captain hook and he doesn't like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Captain Hook.</v>

364
00:19:32.161 --> 00:19:34.140
<v Speaker 1>And that's because captain hook is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrant.</v>

365
00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:36.090
<v Speaker 1>He's brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

366
00:19:36.091 --> 00:19:36.924
<v Speaker 1>and he's also a coward because he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's lost a hand already to a crocodile </v>

367
00:19:40.291 --> 00:19:43.440
<v Speaker 1>with a clock in its stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's chaos and time,</v>

368
00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:44.653
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the dragon that lives underneath </v>

369
00:19:46.051 --> 00:19:46.884
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the basilisk can Harry Potter </v>

370
00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.910
<v Speaker 1>and now Damn Crocodile's already got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of him,</v>

371
00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:51.863
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that crocodile has got a piece of </v>

372
00:19:53.761 --> 00:19:54.660
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

373
00:19:54.661 --> 00:19:58.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm older than 50 and so time is already</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

374
00:19:58.351 --> 00:19:59.550
<v Speaker 1>its grip on me.</v>

375
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:00.383
<v Speaker 1>And you know part of the problem of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being adult is that you also have to </v>

376
00:20:03.541 --> 00:20:04.374
<v Speaker 1>take the fact that your finite and </v>
<v Speaker 1>limited into account and if you're </v>

377
00:20:07.651 --> 00:20:09.930
<v Speaker 1>terrified by that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which people tend to be,</v>

378
00:20:09.931 --> 00:20:10.764
<v Speaker 1>then it can easily turn you into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrant because you're afraid of </v>

379
00:20:13.261 --> 00:20:14.094
<v Speaker 1>everything or disgusted by everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to ramp up the amount you </v>

380
00:20:16.321 --> 00:20:17.154
<v Speaker 1>control it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so Peter Pan looks at Captain Hook </v>

381
00:20:19.021 --> 00:20:22.260
<v Speaker 1>and he thinks there's no damn way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want to end up as.</v>

382
00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:24.390
<v Speaker 1>She's got a bad role model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

383
00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:25.224
<v Speaker 1>So Captain Hook and Stalin in this sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of devouring monster are good </v>

384
00:20:29.431 --> 00:20:33.370
<v Speaker 1>representations of the negative or </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical element of the great father.</v>

385
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:36.030
<v Speaker 1>So that's the tyrannical element of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy.</v>

386
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:39.540
<v Speaker 1>So same thing here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's Stellan,</v>

387
00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:40.573
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the great father of the family and </v>

388
00:20:43.771 --> 00:20:45.150
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these kids are,</v>

389
00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.800
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of like the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent of cub scouts.</v>

390
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.800
<v Speaker 1>They're sort of worshiping him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I really liked the other one on</v>

391
00:20:50.801 --> 00:20:51.634
<v Speaker 1>the right because I mean you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardly find a more hellish </v>

392
00:20:55.361 --> 00:20:57.670
<v Speaker 1>representation of a tyrant than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

393
00:20:57.671 --> 00:21:00.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean it looks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is quite interesting,</v>

394
00:21:00.521 --> 00:21:04.090
<v Speaker 1>it looks like Stellan is standing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of a man.</v>

395
00:21:04.091 --> 00:21:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Door lock is Amanda Mandela is a shape </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this and allman shape.</v>

396
00:21:07.451 --> 00:21:09.310
<v Speaker 1>You see that renaissance art all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

397
00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:10.323
<v Speaker 1>It's an extremely old symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the oldest symbol that people have </v>

398
00:21:13.301 --> 00:21:16.030
<v Speaker 1>ever found evidence for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is on fire,</v>

399
00:21:16.031 --> 00:21:19.060
<v Speaker 1>it's like Stella there he is King of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell.</v>

400
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:20.950
<v Speaker 1>And it's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

401
00:21:20.951 --> 00:21:21.481
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

402
00:21:21.481 --> 00:21:25.660
<v Speaker 1>it's eerie that that's the mode of </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation that emerged for them,</v>

403
00:21:25.661 --> 00:21:27.370
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly accurate.</v>

404
00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.213
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole tyrannical end of the great </v>

405
00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:33.373
<v Speaker 1>fathers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the sort of thing that results </v>

406
00:21:35.021 --> 00:21:35.860
<v Speaker 1>from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

407
00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.420
<v Speaker 1>it's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

408
00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:43.060
<v Speaker 1>elevation of the person at the top of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dominance hierarchy to the status of</v>

409
00:21:43.061 --> 00:21:46.450
<v Speaker 1>some kind of cause identity certainly </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened in Hitler's case.</v>

410
00:21:46.451 --> 00:21:49.360
<v Speaker 1>And then the brutal murderousness that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can emerge from that.</v>

411
00:21:49.361 --> 00:21:50.194
<v Speaker 1>Those are pictures from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration camps at the end of World </v>

412
00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:54.250
<v Speaker 1>War II.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

413
00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:55.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I told you that the fee,</v>

414
00:21:56.030 --> 00:22:00.850
<v Speaker 1>the feminine can be rep that terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown things can be represented by the</v>

415
00:22:00.851 --> 00:22:02.770
<v Speaker 1>feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a monstrous figure,</v>

416
00:22:02.771 --> 00:22:03.604
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly the case that the </v>

417
00:22:05.351 --> 00:22:10.351
<v Speaker 1>monstrosity of culture is roughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to the monstrosity of nature.</v>

418
00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:12.393
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things you might think </v>

419
00:22:13.301 --> 00:22:17.440
<v Speaker 1>about is that common etiologies tend to </v>
<v Speaker 1>utilize these symbolic categories.</v>

420
00:22:17.441 --> 00:22:19.030
<v Speaker 1>It's almost as if they appropriate them.</v>

421
00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.340
<v Speaker 1>So the environmental movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

422
00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.100
<v Speaker 1>basically says benevolent nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

423
00:22:24.101 --> 00:22:26.710
<v Speaker 1>So that's the positive feminine negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

424
00:22:26.711 --> 00:22:27.544
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's cultures out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rapaciously destroying the pristine </v>

425
00:22:30.851 --> 00:22:34.060
<v Speaker 1>wilderness of Mother Nature and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative individual too.</v>

426
00:22:34.061 --> 00:22:34.894
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings are part of that as </v>

427
00:22:36.341 --> 00:22:40.900
<v Speaker 1>individuals and we're kind of a cancer </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the face of the planet if you know,</v>

428
00:22:40.901 --> 00:22:43.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a pretty dark way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at it obviously,</v>

429
00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:46.090
<v Speaker 1>but it's one sided because you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>easily say,</v>

430
00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:46.811
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

431
00:22:46.811 --> 00:22:47.644
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in a war with nature because </v>

432
00:22:48.281 --> 00:22:51.940
<v Speaker 1>obviously she's trying to kill us as </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast as possible and we better have some</v>

433
00:22:51.941 --> 00:22:55.450
<v Speaker 1>culture because otherwise we'd be </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting outside in the freezing snow and</v>

434
00:22:55.451 --> 00:22:57.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be a rapacious consumer,</v>

435
00:22:57.971 --> 00:23:01.600
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand you're just trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to survive and it's not that easy.</v>

436
00:23:01.601 --> 00:23:02.470
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

437
00:23:02.471 --> 00:23:03.304
<v Speaker 1>you need to have both of those stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>together before you have a reasonable </v>

438
00:23:06.221 --> 00:23:07.840
<v Speaker 1>representation of the world.</v>

439
00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:10.210
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy to cope with something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

440
00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:11.253
<v Speaker 1>well like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy to cope with something </v>

441
00:23:13.601 --> 00:23:14.434
<v Speaker 1>like that in every institution has this </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential and this element because </v>

442
00:23:19.241 --> 00:23:20.074
<v Speaker 1>institutions tend towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>bureaucratization and tyranny as they </v>

443
00:23:23.741 --> 00:23:25.750
<v Speaker 1>develop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they close up and become rigid.</v>

444
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:26.651
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

445
00:23:26.651 --> 00:23:29.710
<v Speaker 1>that's a rough thing to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course this is a rough thing</v>

446
00:23:29.711 --> 00:23:31.270
<v Speaker 1>to deal with too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might think,</v>

447
00:23:31.271 --> 00:23:34.570
<v Speaker 1>well you could have a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sympathy for human beings,</v>

448
00:23:34.571 --> 00:23:37.930
<v Speaker 1>not just throw them in the horrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>rapacious creature category,</v>

449
00:23:37.931 --> 00:23:38.764
<v Speaker 1>which I think is an extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological and also a pre genocidal </v>

450
00:23:42.581 --> 00:23:43.810
<v Speaker 1>thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

451
00:23:43.811 --> 00:23:44.644
<v Speaker 1>cause you hear environment to lists for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example now and then say the planet </v>

452
00:23:47.931 --> 00:23:50.360
<v Speaker 1>would be better off without people on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

453
00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:51.373
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

454
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:52.753
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of what Hitler thought as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well about certain kinds of people </v>

455
00:23:55.221 --> 00:23:55.610
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>

456
00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:57.500
<v Speaker 1>And God only knows where he would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped.</v>

457
00:23:57.501 --> 00:24:00.140
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when someone says something like that,</v>

458
00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:01.213
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you might think is you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should take a good look at your </v>

459
00:24:03.321 --> 00:24:06.950
<v Speaker 1>unconscious structure there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bucko because fundamentally you're,</v>

460
00:24:06.951 --> 00:24:07.784
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a genocidal ideology at the </v>

461
00:24:10.671 --> 00:24:12.470
<v Speaker 1>bottom of your thoughts structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

462
00:24:12.471 --> 00:24:13.304
<v Speaker 1>you might think that you're an </v>
<v Speaker 1>environmentalist but you're actually </v>

463
00:24:14.961 --> 00:24:15.794
<v Speaker 1>possessed by a genocidal etiology and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you better do something about that </v>

464
00:24:18.411 --> 00:24:19.244
<v Speaker 1>because if you ever get any power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be one dangerous </v>

465
00:24:21.951 --> 00:24:22.784
<v Speaker 1>creature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that's really </v>

466
00:24:25.011 --> 00:24:25.844
<v Speaker 1>interesting about psychoanalysis or one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the things I love about it is that </v>

467
00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:30.013
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysts tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone says I'm good or I stand for </v>

468
00:24:35.301 --> 00:24:36.134
<v Speaker 1>a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you want to look for is </v>

469
00:24:37.761 --> 00:24:39.170
<v Speaker 1>the opposite of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

470
00:24:39.171 --> 00:24:40.910
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you say.</v>

471
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:42.583
<v Speaker 1>What might really be going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is it actually the case that you're </v>

472
00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:47.120
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ and all the saints </v>
<v Speaker 1>combined?</v>

473
00:24:47.121 --> 00:24:47.954
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're this perfect person or there are </v>

474
00:24:49.391 --> 00:24:54.391
<v Speaker 1>other dark motives for what you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you claim to be doing for the good.</v>

475
00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:59.330
<v Speaker 1>So guy named George Orwell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was one of the world's most creative</v>

476
00:24:59.331 --> 00:25:00.540
<v Speaker 1>essayists in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

477
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:02.930
<v Speaker 1>in in the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a,</v>

478
00:25:02.931 --> 00:25:03.764
<v Speaker 1>he was a left winger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote some things that were very </v>

479
00:25:05.661 --> 00:25:08.040
<v Speaker 1>criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>critical of socialist movements and what</v>

480
00:25:08.041 --> 00:25:08.874
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was one of the early critics of </v>

481
00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:12.453
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Russia when it was sort of in </v>
<v Speaker 1>vogue among intellectuals to be </v>

482
00:25:15.981 --> 00:25:16.814
<v Speaker 1>supportive of the Soviets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things he said about left </v>

483
00:25:19.251 --> 00:25:21.800
<v Speaker 1>wing socialist was that they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really like the poor.</v>

484
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:24.110
<v Speaker 1>He was talking about middleclass left </v>
<v Speaker 1>wing socialist,</v>

485
00:25:24.111 --> 00:25:26.990
<v Speaker 1>not the working class guys who were in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the unions and you know,</v>

486
00:25:26.991 --> 00:25:27.824
<v Speaker 1>had some justification for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggle against those who are at the </v>

487
00:25:31.011 --> 00:25:32.090
<v Speaker 1>top of the power higher.</v>

488
00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:32.953
<v Speaker 1>He was more looking at people that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>already at the top of the power </v>

489
00:25:34.881 --> 00:25:37.550
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are claiming to be advocates for the</v>

490
00:25:37.551 --> 00:25:38.960
<v Speaker 1>working class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

491
00:25:38.961 --> 00:25:42.290
<v Speaker 1>and his claim fundamentally was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>those people didn't like the poor.</v>

492
00:25:42.291 --> 00:25:44.330
<v Speaker 1>They just hated the rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

493
00:25:44.331 --> 00:25:45.164
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was difficult for the publisher who </v>

494
00:25:48.441 --> 00:25:50.750
<v Speaker 1>was publishing that book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was called,</v>

495
00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:54.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>road to Wigan pier,</v>

496
00:25:54.861 --> 00:25:55.694
<v Speaker 1>which is an amazing book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a book about coal miners in </v>

497
00:25:57.471 --> 00:25:59.240
<v Speaker 1>northern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in northern Britain,</v>

498
00:25:59.241 --> 00:26:00.260
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's brutal.</v>

499
00:26:00.261 --> 00:26:01.820
<v Speaker 1>Those people at brutal lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

500
00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:03.860
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>

501
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:05.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

502
00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.430
<v Speaker 1>the publisher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the left book club,</v>

503
00:26:07.431 --> 00:26:08.264
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was very low to publish the essay that </v>

504
00:26:11.061 --> 00:26:11.894
<v Speaker 1>went along with that book because it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a devastating criticism of sort of </v>

505
00:26:14.841 --> 00:26:17.510
<v Speaker 1>middleclass socialism anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

506
00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:19.610
<v Speaker 1>so the psychoanalysts are always telling</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

507
00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:20.900
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

508
00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.180
<v Speaker 1>there you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no monster.</v>

509
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:24.141
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

510
00:26:24.141 --> 00:26:26.060
<v Speaker 1>where's the monster?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's somewhere,</v>

511
00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:29.060
<v Speaker 1>it's somewhere because there's a monster</v>
<v Speaker 1>in everyone.</v>

512
00:26:29.061 --> 00:26:32.180
<v Speaker 1>And if you're hiding it or covering it </v>
<v Speaker 1>up or pretending that you know,</v>

513
00:26:32.181 --> 00:26:33.014
<v Speaker 1>you only stand for the good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like all that means is that you're </v>

514
00:26:35.571 --> 00:26:37.640
<v Speaker 1>ignorant and naive about your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility.</v>

515
00:26:37.641 --> 00:26:39.290
<v Speaker 1>There's a monster around there </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>

516
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:42.110
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

517
00:26:42.111 --> 00:26:43.260
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

518
00:26:43.261 --> 00:26:44.094
<v Speaker 1>if you're not a monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty hard to stay alive because </v>

519
00:26:46.681 --> 00:26:48.750
<v Speaker 1>you know you have to contend with things</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

520
00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:51.103
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

521
00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:52.093
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things like this and things like this </v>

522
00:26:53.781 --> 00:26:56.420
<v Speaker 1>and things like this and things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

523
00:26:56.421 --> 00:26:57.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your life.</v>

524
00:26:57.561 --> 00:26:58.394
<v Speaker 1>You contend with that nature is brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture is brutal and other people can </v>

525
00:27:02.121 --> 00:27:02.954
<v Speaker 1>be brutal too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're not prepared for that </v>

526
00:27:05.001 --> 00:27:05.834
<v Speaker 1>and able to withstand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're just going to get rolled </v>

527
00:27:07.491 --> 00:27:08.324
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you better get the old inner monster </v>

528
00:27:10.551 --> 00:27:13.190
<v Speaker 1>developed because that under conscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>

529
00:27:13.191 --> 00:27:15.170
<v Speaker 1>because even though it's a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

530
00:27:15.171 --> 00:27:17.600
<v Speaker 1>you need it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Taoists for example,</v>

531
00:27:17.601 --> 00:27:18.434
<v Speaker 1>they represent the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>and terms that are quite similar to </v>

532
00:27:23.031 --> 00:27:24.800
<v Speaker 1>those that I just described for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

533
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:27.500
<v Speaker 1>the doubt central Dow assemble is this </v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

534
00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:30.080
<v Speaker 1>the Yin Yang symbol and Yang.</v>

535
00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:31.060
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

536
00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Basically stands for order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it means,</v>

537
00:27:33.431 --> 00:27:35.620
<v Speaker 1>but it means all the things that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>listed there.</v>

538
00:27:35.621 --> 00:27:38.250
<v Speaker 1>It means order masculinity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the daytime,</v>

539
00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:39.093
<v Speaker 1>the known,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also means authoritarianism and </v>

540
00:27:40.721 --> 00:27:41.554
<v Speaker 1>fascism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then yen on the opposite side is </v>

541
00:27:44.021 --> 00:27:45.280
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Femininity,</v>

542
00:27:45.281 --> 00:27:46.480
<v Speaker 1>the night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unknown,</v>

543
00:27:46.481 --> 00:27:49.300
<v Speaker 1>decadence denialism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also a relationship between the</v>

544
00:27:49.301 --> 00:27:53.080
<v Speaker 1>conscious and unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The current consciousness is represented</v>

545
00:27:53.081 --> 00:27:55.270
<v Speaker 1>by light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is,</v>

546
00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:57.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when are you conscious?</v>

547
00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.170
<v Speaker 1>Your conscious during the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

548
00:28:00.171 --> 00:28:01.420
<v Speaker 1>Because we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

549
00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:04.300
<v Speaker 1>we're creatures that live in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlike rats,</v>

550
00:28:04.301 --> 00:28:05.200
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

551
00:28:05.201 --> 00:28:08.140
<v Speaker 1>they live at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for us,</v>

552
00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:09.003
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment and illumination and </v>

553
00:28:11.981 --> 00:28:15.490
<v Speaker 1>daytime and sunrise and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the bright noon sky.</v>

554
00:28:15.491 --> 00:28:17.860
<v Speaker 1>And the unconscious is associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the nighttime.</v>

555
00:28:17.861 --> 00:28:18.694
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that partly too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that your unconscious is actually a </v>

556
00:28:21.011 --> 00:28:22.870
<v Speaker 1>lot more active at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

557
00:28:22.871 --> 00:28:23.950
<v Speaker 1>that's when you dream.</v>

558
00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.353
<v Speaker 1>And it's also the time when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a frightened of something or </v>

559
00:28:27.641 --> 00:28:28.474
<v Speaker 1>if you're depressed and ruminative the </v>
<v Speaker 1>frightening thoughts and the depressing </v>

560
00:28:31.481 --> 00:28:33.520
<v Speaker 1>and ruminative thoughts are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come up.</v>

561
00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:34.563
<v Speaker 1>So many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people have the experience of </v>

562
00:28:36.011 --> 00:28:38.130
<v Speaker 1>waking up in a kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause.</v>

563
00:28:38.131 --> 00:28:40.210
<v Speaker 1>I cold sweat at three in the morning and</v>
<v Speaker 1>having,</v>

564
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.213
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing but it continual stream of </v>

565
00:28:42.401 --> 00:28:43.234
<v Speaker 1>worries run through their head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's pretty good evidence that a </v>

566
00:28:45.431 --> 00:28:48.070
<v Speaker 1>lot of what you're doing at night when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you sleep,</v>

567
00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:51.910
<v Speaker 1>when you're dreaming and when you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>dreaming is actually processing threat,</v>

568
00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:54.040
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But most of the time you were asleep for</v>

569
00:28:54.041 --> 00:28:55.960
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you wake up during it and it's</v>

570
00:28:55.961 --> 00:28:56.794
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

571
00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:58.930
<v Speaker 1>it's not something you really want to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious about.</v>

572
00:28:58.931 --> 00:28:59.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

573
00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:01.660
<v Speaker 1>it's hard on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's very,</v>

574
00:29:01.661 --> 00:29:03.520
<v Speaker 1>very common among people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed,</v>

575
00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:04.503
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

576
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:06.850
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to diagnose someone for </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression,</v>

577
00:29:06.851 --> 00:29:08.590
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you ask them is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

578
00:29:08.591 --> 00:29:10.750
<v Speaker 1>is your sleep chopped up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

579
00:29:10.751 --> 00:29:13.810
<v Speaker 1>do you wake up multiple times at night </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you wake up,</v>

580
00:29:13.811 --> 00:29:15.460
<v Speaker 1>what happens if they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>

581
00:29:15.461 --> 00:29:17.890
<v Speaker 1>I have worries running through my head </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can't stop them.</v>

582
00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.950
<v Speaker 1>That's rumination cause it's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>automatic process.</v>

583
00:29:20.951 --> 00:29:21.784
<v Speaker 1>It's an unconscious process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you know that the balance between </v>

584
00:29:24.191 --> 00:29:27.760
<v Speaker 1>positive and negative emotion has </v>
<v Speaker 1>shifted too far for that person.</v>

585
00:29:27.761 --> 00:29:31.930
<v Speaker 1>There's so much chaos and pain in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>life or their,</v>

586
00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:32.883
<v Speaker 1>their emotional systems have become </v>
<v Speaker 1>dysregulated that it starting to pop up </v>

587
00:29:36.521 --> 00:29:37.354
<v Speaker 1>into consciousness and dominated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now the end Yang symbol is </v>

588
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:43.850
<v Speaker 1>interesting for a variety of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons too because um,</v>

589
00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:45.273
<v Speaker 1>the Dow was believed that that symbol </v>
<v Speaker 1>represents being now being is not the </v>

590
00:29:49.721 --> 00:29:50.554
<v Speaker 1>same thing as objective reality being is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you experience as a conscious </v>

591
00:29:54.671 --> 00:29:57.970
<v Speaker 1>creature that's being and for the Dow is</v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

592
00:29:57.971 --> 00:30:01.000
<v Speaker 1>is made up of these two elements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>order in chaos.</v>

593
00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:03.220
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite straight forward.</v>

594
00:30:03.221 --> 00:30:04.054
<v Speaker 1>The reason for that is wherever you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>and whenever you live and whoever you </v>

595
00:30:07.511 --> 00:30:08.344
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each environment that you're in is </v>

596
00:30:10.721 --> 00:30:14.710
<v Speaker 1>composed of things you understand and </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that work the way you expect them</v>

597
00:30:14.711 --> 00:30:18.160
<v Speaker 1>to and things you do not understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that can be,</v>

598
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:20.530
<v Speaker 1>that can pull the rug out from you at </v>
<v Speaker 1>any moment.</v>

599
00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:21.603
<v Speaker 1>And so you can say in some sense that </v>
<v Speaker 1>these symbolic representations are </v>

600
00:30:24.731 --> 00:30:28.830
<v Speaker 1>representations of the most unchanging </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of [inaudible].</v>

601
00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:31.620
<v Speaker 1>So the most real things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

602
00:30:31.621 --> 00:30:33.670
<v Speaker 1>a typical modern person look at this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

603
00:30:33.671 --> 00:30:36.100
<v Speaker 1>well those aren't real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they are real.</v>

604
00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:36.963
<v Speaker 1>In fact they're hyper real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things that defines </v>

605
00:30:40.271 --> 00:30:42.910
<v Speaker 1>real is that it's permanent and it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>permanent.</v>

606
00:30:42.911 --> 00:30:45.010
<v Speaker 1>No matter where you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are things you know and things you</v>

607
00:30:45.011 --> 00:30:46.840
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't matter who you are,</v>

608
00:30:46.841 --> 00:30:47.674
<v Speaker 1>it's permanent.</v>

609
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.580
<v Speaker 1>So it's part of the existential </v>
<v Speaker 1>landscape of human being.</v>

610
00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:52.923
<v Speaker 1>Now the other thing that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two other things that are quite </v>

611
00:30:54.341 --> 00:30:57.520
<v Speaker 1>cool about the and Yang symbol in one is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>

612
00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:00.490
<v Speaker 1>each of the black pays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has little white dots in it.</v>

613
00:31:00.491 --> 00:31:02.260
<v Speaker 1>And White Paisley has a little black.in </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

614
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:03.333
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is the Dow is </v>
<v Speaker 1>also recognized quite well that chaos </v>

615
00:31:06.611 --> 00:31:08.800
<v Speaker 1>could turn to order at any moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

616
00:31:08.801 --> 00:31:12.200
<v Speaker 1>so a new order can arise out of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaotic structure that's like a,</v>

617
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:15.910
<v Speaker 1>that's a revolution in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by the same token,</v>

618
00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:18.370
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a place that's orderly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>predictable,</v>

619
00:31:18.371 --> 00:31:21.790
<v Speaker 1>something can happen that casts you into</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chaotic situation right away.</v>

620
00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:25.060
<v Speaker 1>So there's a dynamic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though these two things oppose each</v>

621
00:31:25.061 --> 00:31:26.020
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>

622
00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.840
<v Speaker 1>there's a continual dynamic interplay </v>
<v Speaker 1>between them.</v>

623
00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:32.140
<v Speaker 1>And then the final thing that's quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about this symbol,</v>

624
00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.153
<v Speaker 1>this is mindbogglingly brilliant idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that because the dao also means the </v>

625
00:31:37.721 --> 00:31:40.870
<v Speaker 1>way and the way is the line between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

626
00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:44.980
<v Speaker 1>And so what that indicates is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a brilliant idea,</v>

627
00:31:44.981 --> 00:31:49.981
<v Speaker 1>is that the optimal position for a human</v>
<v Speaker 1>being isn't in chaos or in order.</v>

628
00:31:51.491 --> 00:31:52.324
<v Speaker 1>Because if it's too much order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's totalitarian and if it's too </v>

629
00:31:54.791 --> 00:31:59.230
<v Speaker 1>much chaos than it's disgust and fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>and emotional pain and depression.</v>

630
00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:00.453
<v Speaker 1>So where's the proper place and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dallas dancers right on the line where </v>

631
00:32:04.991 --> 00:32:05.824
<v Speaker 1>you have one foot in order so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fairly stable and you have </v>

632
00:32:08.321 --> 00:32:09.154
<v Speaker 1>another foot in chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that new and interesting and </v>

633
00:32:11.441 --> 00:32:13.900
<v Speaker 1>compelling and transforming things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening to you.</v>

634
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:15.063
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>note is that your nervous system </v>

635
00:32:18.671 --> 00:32:19.504
<v Speaker 1>basically tells you when you're there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the way it tells you is by making </v>

636
00:32:23.351 --> 00:32:25.780
<v Speaker 1>you interested in whatever it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're engaged in.</v>

637
00:32:25.781 --> 00:32:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Because the fact that the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're engaged in grips you,</v>

638
00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.910
<v Speaker 1>which is really an unconscious process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't really control that.</v>

639
00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:36.490
<v Speaker 1>It's something that happens to you is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because your nervous system,</v>

640
00:32:36.491 --> 00:32:37.324
<v Speaker 1>which is actually adapted to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment of chaos and order is </v>

641
00:32:40.791 --> 00:32:43.580
<v Speaker 1>telling you that if you're engaged and </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested,</v>

642
00:32:43.581 --> 00:32:47.580
<v Speaker 1>you are at in the place where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>balance between chaos and order is,</v>

643
00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.940
<v Speaker 1>is perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you think about that,</v>

644
00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:54.620
<v Speaker 1>it's no use reading a paper that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot understand at all.</v>

645
00:32:54.621 --> 00:32:57.440
<v Speaker 1>Even though hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be a tremendously informative</v>

646
00:32:57.441 --> 00:32:58.580
<v Speaker 1>paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

647
00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:01.580
<v Speaker 1>But you can't understand it because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>all chaos to you.</v>

648
00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:05.030
<v Speaker 1>And then there's absolutely no reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading a paper,</v>

649
00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:06.043
<v Speaker 1>that tense time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've already extracted the </v>

650
00:33:08.211 --> 00:33:10.280
<v Speaker 1>information out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be boring.</v>

651
00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:11.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what do you want?</v>

652
00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:13.123
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want a paper that you can almost </v>

653
00:33:14.091 --> 00:33:15.920
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

654
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:16.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

655
00:33:16.551 --> 00:33:17.384
<v Speaker 1>you're the frameworks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cognitive frameworks that you have </v>

656
00:33:19.311 --> 00:33:20.144
<v Speaker 1>at hand are sufficient for you to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next step into the unknown and the </v>

657
00:33:24.321 --> 00:33:26.600
<v Speaker 1>paper will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will inform you of that.</v>

658
00:33:26.601 --> 00:33:28.820
<v Speaker 1>And so those are the sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Books do that.</v>

659
00:33:28.821 --> 00:33:32.660
<v Speaker 1>Movies do that conversations do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>even lines of thought do that.</v>

660
00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:37.340
<v Speaker 1>If they're exactly at the right level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity for you,</v>

661
00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:40.700
<v Speaker 1>they're going to engage you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people know this man.</v>

662
00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:42.710
<v Speaker 1>They know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's an example.</v>

663
00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.210
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you're trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

664
00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:50.180
<v Speaker 1>we could say you're trying to teach your</v>
<v Speaker 1>child to talk,</v>

665
00:33:50.181 --> 00:33:52.820
<v Speaker 1>which of course you don't do what you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a child,</v>

666
00:33:52.821 --> 00:33:53.654
<v Speaker 1>just talk to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's very interesting because there </v>

667
00:33:55.581 --> 00:33:56.414
<v Speaker 1>have been studies of how parents talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>children and what they do is always use </v>

668
00:34:00.291 --> 00:34:04.220
<v Speaker 1>language that slightly more complex than</v>
<v Speaker 1>the child can understand.</v>

669
00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:07.220
<v Speaker 1>And they do it automatically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part of our,</v>

670
00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:08.960
<v Speaker 1>what a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>

671
00:34:08.961 --> 00:34:11.240
<v Speaker 1>our innate knowledge structure about </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

672
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:14.690
<v Speaker 1>So you don't only use words that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>child understands,</v>

673
00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:15.793
<v Speaker 1>use words that they understand plus a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few words and phrases and sentence </v>

674
00:34:18.381 --> 00:34:19.214
<v Speaker 1>constructions that they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's sort of pulling them </v>

675
00:34:21.381 --> 00:34:22.214
<v Speaker 1>along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a Russian psychologist named the </v>

676
00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:24.773
<v Speaker 1>Gonski called that the zone of proximal </v>
<v Speaker 1>development and the zone of proximal </v>

677
00:34:28.551 --> 00:34:29.384
<v Speaker 1>development is that place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's a place in the environment </v>

678
00:34:32.601 --> 00:34:35.960
<v Speaker 1>where information flow into the psyche </v>
<v Speaker 1>is maximized.</v>

679
00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.060
<v Speaker 1>And that has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it has to be,</v>

680
00:34:38.061 --> 00:34:40.340
<v Speaker 1>cause I comprehensible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

681
00:34:40.341 --> 00:34:42.080
<v Speaker 1>it's something I tried to do in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>lectures.</v>

682
00:34:42.081 --> 00:34:42.914
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to tell you things that you </v>

683
00:34:44.151 --> 00:34:44.984
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and associate them with things that you </v>

684
00:34:46.431 --> 00:34:49.490
<v Speaker 1>don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you're not swamped,</v>

685
00:34:49.491 --> 00:34:52.490
<v Speaker 1>hopefully by an excess of </v>
<v Speaker 1>incomprehensible information,</v>

686
00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:54.050
<v Speaker 1>but you don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

687
00:34:54.051 --> 00:34:55.790
<v Speaker 1>he's saying that again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I already know that,</v>

688
00:34:55.791 --> 00:34:56.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

689
00:34:56.611 --> 00:35:00.410
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and anything that's dramatic instructure</v>

690
00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:01.970
<v Speaker 1>is doing that for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's keeping them,</v>

691
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.920
<v Speaker 1>it's keeping you on the edge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

692
00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:05.443
<v Speaker 1>And that place is where your adaptation </v>
<v Speaker 1>is maximized because not only are you </v>

693
00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:13.130
<v Speaker 1>firming up the structure that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath your feet,</v>

694
00:35:13.131 --> 00:35:13.964
<v Speaker 1>you're relying on it and you know it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's part of the platform on which you </v>

695
00:35:16.551 --> 00:35:17.384
<v Speaker 1>stand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're absorbing information at a </v>

696
00:35:18.921 --> 00:35:19.754
<v Speaker 1>rate that allows you to increase the </v>
<v Speaker 1>solidity and area of that solid ground </v>

697
00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:29.990
<v Speaker 1>without undermining you so much that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>falls apart beneath you.</v>

698
00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:31.423
<v Speaker 1>So it's lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a good idea because think </v>

699
00:35:33.921 --> 00:35:34.754
<v Speaker 1>about what it would mean if it was true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would mean that if you pay attention </v>

700
00:35:38.221 --> 00:35:41.520
<v Speaker 1>to what captures your interest and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow that,</v>

701
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.160
<v Speaker 1>that means you're going to always be </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in what you're doing.</v>

702
00:35:44.161 --> 00:35:44.994
<v Speaker 1>But even better than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to mean that you're going to </v>

703
00:35:46.621 --> 00:35:51.621
<v Speaker 1>maximize your adaptive capacity as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>as possible at exactly the same time,</v>

704
00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:53.123
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be a great deal if it actually </v>

705
00:35:54.031 --> 00:35:54.864
<v Speaker 1>happened to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a bit complicated because what </v>

706
00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:02.910
<v Speaker 1>culture wants from you and what is </v>
<v Speaker 1>intrinsically interesting to you,</v>

707
00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:04.830
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be a conflict there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

708
00:36:04.831 --> 00:36:08.910
<v Speaker 1>Because culture wants you to do what a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good cultural entities should do,</v>

709
00:36:08.911 --> 00:36:12.450
<v Speaker 1>which is to do what you're told to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not,</v>

710
00:36:12.451 --> 00:36:13.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not a robot.</v>

711
00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:14.693
<v Speaker 1>And so part of the existential problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have in life is trying to </v>

712
00:36:17.521 --> 00:36:18.354
<v Speaker 1>figure out some compromise between what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you find personally engaging and that </v>

713
00:36:23.521 --> 00:36:27.840
<v Speaker 1>develops and supports you and what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture will provide,</v>

714
00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:31.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resources to you for pursuing.</v>

715
00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:33.900
<v Speaker 1>And it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no simple answer to it.</v>

716
00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:39.260
<v Speaker 1>But I would say that if you sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

717
00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:40.553
<v Speaker 1>your capacity to engage in meaningful </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity to the security of a given </v>

718
00:36:44.941 --> 00:36:48.030
<v Speaker 1>position in a dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you turn into something that's like</v>

719
00:36:48.031 --> 00:36:49.380
<v Speaker 1>a soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a slave.</v>

720
00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:50.483
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really bad idea because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way you can do that for any </v>

721
00:36:53.611 --> 00:36:56.130
<v Speaker 1>length of time without getting bored and</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful.</v>

722
00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:57.263
<v Speaker 1>And once your board and resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the move from that to dangerous is a </v>

723
00:37:00.511 --> 00:37:02.280
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very small step.</v>

724
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:03.623
<v Speaker 1>So it's hard and it isn't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily the case that you're going </v>

725
00:37:06.181 --> 00:37:07.014
<v Speaker 1>to make the balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you're going to be able to </v>

726
00:37:08.371 --> 00:37:10.380
<v Speaker 1>manage it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't,</v>

727
00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:12.390
<v Speaker 1>you're going to pay a massive price for </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

728
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.340
<v Speaker 1>So I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

729
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:15.263
<v Speaker 1>let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't let people mess around with what </v>

730
00:37:17.101 --> 00:37:20.310
<v Speaker 1>you find compelling any more than is </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely necessary.</v>

731
00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:21.593
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so because it's very dangerous to do </v>

732
00:37:24.121 --> 00:37:25.620
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very dangerous to do that.</v>

733
00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:26.633
<v Speaker 1>Just like it's dangerous not to find a </v>
<v Speaker 1>position in the dominance hierarchy at </v>

734
00:37:29.281 --> 00:37:32.220
<v Speaker 1>all because then you end up in a chaotic</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

735
00:37:32.221 --> 00:37:35.130
<v Speaker 1>And my experiences being you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might wonder about this,</v>

736
00:37:35.131 --> 00:37:39.240
<v Speaker 1>it's like what's the probability that </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone can live a healthy life,</v>

737
00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:40.650
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>productive,</v>

738
00:37:40.651 --> 00:37:43.620
<v Speaker 1>and stable life outside a dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

739
00:37:43.621 --> 00:37:47.700
<v Speaker 1>So without external structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is there might be</v>

740
00:37:47.701 --> 00:37:49.980
<v Speaker 1>one person in this class that could do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

741
00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:54.510
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard because what happens to</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people is that if they don't have a</v>

742
00:37:54.511 --> 00:37:57.720
<v Speaker 1>substantial amount of external structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>and routine,</v>

743
00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:00.720
<v Speaker 1>they just fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't sleep properly,</v>

744
00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:02.580
<v Speaker 1>they don't eat properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

745
00:38:02.581 --> 00:38:03.414
<v Speaker 1>they're depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tremendously effortful to </v>

746
00:38:05.641 --> 00:38:08.250
<v Speaker 1>continually reinvent yourself day after </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

747
00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:12.450
<v Speaker 1>And so there's some real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some real utility in routine and</v>

748
00:38:12.451 --> 00:38:14.290
<v Speaker 1>social identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

749
00:38:14.291 --> 00:38:15.124
<v Speaker 1>and young would say the part of you that</v>
<v Speaker 1>has adapted to re routine and social </v>

750
00:38:18.991 --> 00:38:19.824
<v Speaker 1>identity is the persona and sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mask you wear in public and might even </v>

751
00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:24.990
<v Speaker 1>be who you think you are.</v>

752
00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:27.690
<v Speaker 1>And he thought that people who were only</v>
<v Speaker 1>persona,</v>

753
00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:28.793
<v Speaker 1>we're dangerous because they were only </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughtless advocates of the system for </v>

754
00:38:32.521 --> 00:38:35.800
<v Speaker 1>which they stood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he also believed that people who had</v>

755
00:38:35.801 --> 00:38:36.634
<v Speaker 1>no persona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in an equally terrible situation </v>

756
00:38:38.981 --> 00:38:39.814
<v Speaker 1>because they're psychologically chaotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they don't have a social structure </v>

757
00:38:43.571 --> 00:38:44.404
<v Speaker 1>around them to hem them in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>continually remind them how to be sane </v>

758
00:38:47.771 --> 00:38:50.530
<v Speaker 1>and productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a matter of balance.</v>

759
00:38:50.531 --> 00:38:51.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

760
00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:55.660
<v Speaker 1>there's horrors on both sides and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's advantages on both sides.</v>

761
00:38:55.661 --> 00:38:56.494
<v Speaker 1>And the trick is to place yourself in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>location where you're deriving maximum </v>

762
00:39:00.311 --> 00:39:01.144
<v Speaker 1>advantage from both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'll be able to tell if you do </v>

763
00:39:02.891 --> 00:39:04.480
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you are doing that,</v>

764
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:08.140
<v Speaker 1>you're going to find your life engaging </v>
<v Speaker 1>and meaningful enough.</v>

765
00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:09.123
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that it's also tragic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially composed at least partially </v>

766
00:39:12.941 --> 00:39:15.520
<v Speaker 1>of slavery is going to be acceptable.</v>

767
00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:18.370
<v Speaker 1>And that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the goal in some sense.</v>

768
00:39:18.371 --> 00:39:20.410
<v Speaker 1>It's a hard to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

769
00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:23.620
<v Speaker 1>it's hard not to do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're screwed either way.</v>

770
00:39:23.621 --> 00:39:26.860
<v Speaker 1>So you might as well pick the path </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be of maximum utility to</v>

771
00:39:26.861 --> 00:39:28.150
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

772
00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:31.720
<v Speaker 1>so and hopefully to everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

773
00:39:31.721 --> 00:39:35.710
<v Speaker 1>so this is the individual instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have explored territory,</v>

774
00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:40.360
<v Speaker 1>unexplored territory or the known and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the unknown or order and chaos.</v>

775
00:39:40.361 --> 00:39:43.690
<v Speaker 1>And then we have the thing that mediates</v>
<v Speaker 1>between them.</v>

776
00:39:43.691 --> 00:39:46.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is no medieval representation,</v>

777
00:39:46.481 --> 00:39:48.400
<v Speaker 1>which I really love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

778
00:39:48.401 --> 00:39:49.234
<v Speaker 1>there's the dome of the sky there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very archaic idea that the earth </v>

779
00:39:52.301 --> 00:39:55.510
<v Speaker 1>is a dome because it kind of looks like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you go out into a flat field,</v>

780
00:39:55.511 --> 00:39:56.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're out in the ocean,</v>

781
00:39:56.970 --> 00:40:00.310
<v Speaker 1>the way the world looks like a dome on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>disk.</v>

782
00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:02.230
<v Speaker 1>And so that's sort of the representation</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

783
00:40:02.231 --> 00:40:03.064
<v Speaker 1>It's a very ancient idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this guy at the bottom left of the </v>

784
00:40:06.701 --> 00:40:07.534
<v Speaker 1>picture is poking his head through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensible world and looking at the </v>

785
00:40:11.471 --> 00:40:14.800
<v Speaker 1>chaos beyond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he's a heroic figure.</v>

786
00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:18.880
<v Speaker 1>So the knower is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual is always the hero of his</v>

787
00:40:18.881 --> 00:40:19.631
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

788
00:40:19.631 --> 00:40:22.360
<v Speaker 1>The protagonist of historic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it can be an antihero too,</v>

789
00:40:22.361 --> 00:40:27.100
<v Speaker 1>because just like the known has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative element and a pause development</v>

790
00:40:27.101 --> 00:40:29.710
<v Speaker 1>and the unknown has a negative element </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a positive element.</v>

791
00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:33.040
<v Speaker 1>The individual has a negative element </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a positive element.</v>

792
00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:35.410
<v Speaker 1>And so there's the hero and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>adversary,</v>

793
00:40:35.411 --> 00:40:36.910
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

794
00:40:36.911 --> 00:40:41.230
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of movies where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>protagonist is an anti hero,</v>

795
00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:42.093
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those movies are usually there to </v>

796
00:40:43.451 --> 00:40:44.284
<v Speaker 1>show you bad examples in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you get mixed characters like Batman </v>

797
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:50.200
<v Speaker 1>and he's tangled up with the joker.</v>

798
00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:53.740
<v Speaker 1>And as the joker points out in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant performance,</v>

799
00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:56.770
<v Speaker 1>they're mirror images of one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

800
00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:00.110
<v Speaker 1>the jokers and adversary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

801
00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:01.990
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more complicated than that.</v>

802
00:41:01.991 --> 00:41:02.824
<v Speaker 1>But so some of the symbols that commonly</v>
<v Speaker 1>represent the individual in symbolic </v>

803
00:41:07.061 --> 00:41:07.894
<v Speaker 1>representations are while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also conceptual representations are </v>

804
00:41:10.871 --> 00:41:11.704
<v Speaker 1>ego consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The trickster bugs bunny is a good </v>

805
00:41:15.281 --> 00:41:17.500
<v Speaker 1>example of a trickster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fool,</v>

806
00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:18.843
<v Speaker 1>the hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coward spirit as opposed to matter </v>

807
00:41:21.521 --> 00:41:23.590
<v Speaker 1>or as opposed to dogma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the son,</v>

808
00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:27.280
<v Speaker 1>the son of the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the son of the king.</v>

809
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.170
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those are very,</v>

810
00:41:29.171 --> 00:41:30.004
<v Speaker 1>very common fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll walk you through some of that </v>

811
00:41:31.391 --> 00:41:33.530
<v Speaker 1>as we progress today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

812
00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:35.390
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the figure of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>adversary.</v>

813
00:41:35.391 --> 00:41:38.480
<v Speaker 1>So you see on the right hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left hand side there,</v>

814
00:41:38.481 --> 00:41:42.230
<v Speaker 1>you see Horus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the bird headed god of Egypt,</v>

815
00:41:42.231 --> 00:41:43.064
<v Speaker 1>who I told you about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who represents the capacity to pay </v>

816
00:41:44.721 --> 00:41:45.554
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

817
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:49.250
<v Speaker 1>Very important concept because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Egyptians realized,</v>

818
00:41:49.251 --> 00:41:50.084
<v Speaker 1>and really it's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is something modern people do not </v>

819
00:41:52.011 --> 00:41:56.160
<v Speaker 1>understand because we tend to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationality the highest God that's,</v>

820
00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:59.420
<v Speaker 1>that's not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a pathway to totalitarianism.</v>

821
00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:00.493
<v Speaker 1>What the Egyptians knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they only knew it in symbolic form </v>

822
00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:04.243
<v Speaker 1>was it was the capacity to attend to </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that in some sense was the </v>

823
00:42:07.611 --> 00:42:08.444
<v Speaker 1>highest psychological function because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the capacity to pay attention that </v>

824
00:42:11.301 --> 00:42:13.850
<v Speaker 1>actually moves you beyond what you only </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

825
00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:16.550
<v Speaker 1>And rationality tends to make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

826
00:42:16.551 --> 00:42:17.384
<v Speaker 1>integral systems that are coherent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are boxlike and then claim that </v>

827
00:42:20.991 --> 00:42:21.824
<v Speaker 1>they're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the tension has always looking </v>

828
00:42:23.631 --> 00:42:24.464
<v Speaker 1>beyond what you know and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and attention is an unbelievably </v>

829
00:42:27.801 --> 00:42:29.830
<v Speaker 1>powerful force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

830
00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:33.710
<v Speaker 1>that's why advertisers pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why people demand it.</v>

831
00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:35.600
<v Speaker 1>That's why children can't live without </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

832
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:38.240
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's what you want from your </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends and your family.</v>

833
00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:42.590
<v Speaker 1>You want them to pay attention to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an unbelievably valuable resource.</v>

834
00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:45.440
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things I always tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>my clients,</v>

835
00:42:45.441 --> 00:42:47.210
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're socially anxious,</v>

836
00:42:47.211 --> 00:42:48.044
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

837
00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:51.950
<v Speaker 1>pay more attention to the person you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to.</v>

838
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:53.203
<v Speaker 1>If you pay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really pay close attention to </v>

839
00:42:55.041 --> 00:42:55.874
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the thoughts that are making you </v>

840
00:42:56.961 --> 00:42:57.794
<v Speaker 1>anxious will be suppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because you're paying close </v>

841
00:42:59.841 --> 00:43:00.674
<v Speaker 1>attention to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll match your movements to theirs </v>

842
00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:05.090
<v Speaker 1>and you'll match your conversation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

843
00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:08.180
<v Speaker 1>And then there's no reason for you to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>socially anxious cause socially anxious.</v>

844
00:43:08.181 --> 00:43:09.890
<v Speaker 1>People will go like this when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking,</v>

845
00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:11.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to look at you.</v>

846
00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:12.433
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the hell can you engage anyone if </v>

847
00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:16.640
<v Speaker 1>you're not in a little dance with them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

848
00:43:16.641 --> 00:43:18.710
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of it's nonverbal,</v>

849
00:43:18.711 --> 00:43:22.400
<v Speaker 1>it's physical and it's embodied and </v>
<v Speaker 1>without paying attention,</v>

850
00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:23.990
<v Speaker 1>then you lose people.</v>

851
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:26.120
<v Speaker 1>And you see this with speakers all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time too.</v>

852
00:43:26.121 --> 00:43:26.954
<v Speaker 1>There in front of audiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have their paper and they're going </v>

853
00:43:28.941 --> 00:43:29.774
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And usually they're talking like this </v>

854
00:43:31.491 --> 00:43:32.420
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

855
00:43:32.421 --> 00:43:34.580
<v Speaker 1>the logical thing to do in that case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

856
00:43:34.581 --> 00:43:37.970
<v Speaker 1>look at facebook or get the hell out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>there or something.</v>

857
00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:40.700
<v Speaker 1>But they're not paying attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

858
00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:41.713
<v Speaker 1>And so there's no power in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no power in the dynamic </v>

859
00:43:44.361 --> 00:43:47.570
<v Speaker 1>conversation at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

860
00:43:47.571 --> 00:43:50.720
<v Speaker 1>so there's horace and then there's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy on the,</v>

861
00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:52.123
<v Speaker 1>on the right there is set and he's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the precursor of the Christian </v>

862
00:43:55.281 --> 00:43:57.140
<v Speaker 1>representation of Satan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

863
00:43:57.141 --> 00:43:57.974
<v Speaker 1>the namesake and seems to have been a </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation of the name set and set </v>

864
00:44:02.121 --> 00:44:02.954
<v Speaker 1>is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like the God of totalitarian </v>

865
00:44:05.841 --> 00:44:10.040
<v Speaker 1>possibility because in Egyptian </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythology he represents the brother,</v>

866
00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:10.933
<v Speaker 1>the evil brother of the rightful king </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's always plotting to overthrow the </v>

867
00:44:14.391 --> 00:44:15.224
<v Speaker 1>rightful king.</v>

868
00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:18.380
<v Speaker 1>And Horace is his natural enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what this means,</v>

869
00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.210
<v Speaker 1>our Italian man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really important.</v>

870
00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:21.313
<v Speaker 1>So I have in my clinical practice </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequently people who are stuck in the </v>

871
00:44:24.081 --> 00:44:26.360
<v Speaker 1>middle of absolutely moronic </v>
<v Speaker 1>bureaucracy.</v>

872
00:44:26.361 --> 00:44:29.150
<v Speaker 1>So I can give you an example of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just love this.</v>

873
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 1>One of my clients who worked for large </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation,</v>

874
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:35.820
<v Speaker 1>who's pretty sensible woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she is being driven mad by the political</v>

875
00:44:35.821 --> 00:44:37.930
<v Speaker 1>correctness that didn't detected the </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>

876
00:44:37.931 --> 00:44:38.764
<v Speaker 1>And she sent me a 30 to 32 email letter </v>
<v Speaker 1>exchanges that were circulating around </v>

877
00:44:46.471 --> 00:44:47.304
<v Speaker 1>the word flip chart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if any of you have heard </v>

878
00:44:48.751 --> 00:44:51.700
<v Speaker 1>the flip chart conver controversy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's Kurt pretty mind.</v>

879
00:44:51.701 --> 00:44:56.490
<v Speaker 1>Bogglingly moronic and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the deal was that somebody,</v>

880
00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:57.780
<v Speaker 1>you know what a flip chart is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

881
00:44:57.781 --> 00:45:01.020
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those paper pads that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>flip the paper over.</v>

882
00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Well it turns out hypothetically that </v>
<v Speaker 1>flip is a pejorative term for Filipinos.</v>

883
00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:06.923
<v Speaker 1>And so they believe that the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flip chart phrase was no longer </v>

884
00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:14.180
<v Speaker 1>acceptable because it was potentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>offensive to Filipinos,</v>

885
00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:15.023
<v Speaker 1>although I bet they would have had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>like vacuum up the whole planet to find </v>

886
00:45:17.731 --> 00:45:21.750
<v Speaker 1>one Filipino who actually cared whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>or not someone called that a flip chart,</v>

887
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:23.940
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that person would have had plenty of</v>

888
00:45:23.941 --> 00:45:26.190
<v Speaker 1>problems that were worse than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

889
00:45:26.191 --> 00:45:27.024
<v Speaker 1>there was like a 32 serious email </v>
<v Speaker 1>exchanges about what terminology should </v>

890
00:45:31.711 --> 00:45:34.080
<v Speaker 1>be used instead of flip chart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

891
00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:34.923
<v Speaker 1>So that's what people were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of trying to actually have a </v>

892
00:45:36.841 --> 00:45:40.470
<v Speaker 1>life and do something useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was driving her completely mad.</v>

893
00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:43.110
<v Speaker 1>They did rename them and made it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

894
00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:45.013
<v Speaker 1>it made part of corporate policy that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was inappropriate to use the word flip </v>

895
00:45:48.091 --> 00:45:48.924
<v Speaker 1>chart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what the hell they </v>

896
00:45:49.471 --> 00:45:51.210
<v Speaker 1>called them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows.</v>

897
00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:52.553
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reason I'm telling you this </v>

898
00:45:54.421 --> 00:45:55.254
<v Speaker 1>story is Lada you are going to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself in bedded in bureaucracies and </v>

899
00:45:59.071 --> 00:45:59.904
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's that for better or for </v>

900
00:46:00.451 --> 00:46:00.780
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

901
00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:03.660
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that are going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to happen to you is that people</v>

902
00:46:03.661 --> 00:46:04.494
<v Speaker 1>are going to ask you to do stupid and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous things and the fact that </v>

903
00:46:08.791 --> 00:46:10.920
<v Speaker 1>they're asking you to do stupid and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous things,</v>

904
00:46:10.921 --> 00:46:12.960
<v Speaker 1>it's going to do two things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three things to you.</v>

905
00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:13.943
<v Speaker 1>One is it a warp you so that you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretend that you agree with it and then </v>

906
00:46:16.921 --> 00:46:20.580
<v Speaker 1>eventually you will and like good so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much for your soul.</v>

907
00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:21.653
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it will demotivate you because </v>

908
00:46:24.091 --> 00:46:24.924
<v Speaker 1>you'll think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why should I be s like slaving away at </v>

909
00:46:27.061 --> 00:46:31.980
<v Speaker 1>this job when you know I'm being pecked </v>
<v Speaker 1>to death by morons with stupid rules.</v>

910
00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:33.680
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

911
00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:37.380
<v Speaker 1>the third thing that it will do is make </v>
<v Speaker 1>you resentful and irritated,</v>

912
00:46:37.381 --> 00:46:41.340
<v Speaker 1>and then that will also undermine your </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation and make your life miserable.</v>

913
00:46:41.341 --> 00:46:42.480
<v Speaker 1>And so you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

914
00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:44.460
<v Speaker 1>what should you do about that?</v>

915
00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:45.413
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>object at the earliest possible point </v>

916
00:46:50.371 --> 00:46:52.620
<v Speaker 1>because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll find that if you do,</v>

917
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:56.580
<v Speaker 1>if you object to radical stupidity when </v>
<v Speaker 1>it first emerges,</v>

918
00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:57.593
<v Speaker 1>you kind of make people aware of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that what they're doing is </v>

919
00:46:59.371 --> 00:47:02.250
<v Speaker 1>radically stupid and they'll usually </v>
<v Speaker 1>back off.</v>

920
00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:04.680
<v Speaker 1>And so then they won't torture you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

921
00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:06.000
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

922
00:47:06.001 --> 00:47:07.590
<v Speaker 1>you have to take a risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

923
00:47:07.591 --> 00:47:09.690
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens if I complain about this?</v>

924
00:47:09.691 --> 00:47:10.524
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's another one of those situations </v>

925
00:47:12.151 --> 00:47:14.490
<v Speaker 1>where you're damned if you do and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>damned if you don't.</v>

926
00:47:14.491 --> 00:47:16.950
<v Speaker 1>So if you complain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll cause some trouble.</v>

927
00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:17.933
<v Speaker 1>Although usually it causes way less </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble than you'd think because people </v>

928
00:47:20.791 --> 00:47:21.624
<v Speaker 1>are generally not very courageous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you push them with some strength </v>

929
00:47:24.961 --> 00:47:27.450
<v Speaker 1>on when they're doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely moronic,</v>

930
00:47:27.451 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 1>they'll usually back off because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know what to do when they're being</v>

931
00:47:30.101 --> 00:47:30.934
<v Speaker 1>challenged.</v>

932
00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.640
<v Speaker 1>And then you won't have to put up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it for the rest of your life.</v>

933
00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:38.200
<v Speaker 1>And so why I'm telling you this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because all sorts of bureaucratic</v>

934
00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:41.920
<v Speaker 1>entities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations,</v>

935
00:47:41.921 --> 00:47:44.080
<v Speaker 1>government institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

936
00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:48.670
<v Speaker 1>nonprofit organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that's above a certain size,</v>

937
00:47:48.671 --> 00:47:50.560
<v Speaker 1>cause it doesn't matter if it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>government or corporate,</v>

938
00:47:50.561 --> 00:47:52.960
<v Speaker 1>it's all the same bloody foolishness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it gets too big.</v>

939
00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:56.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 towards totalitarian structures.</v>

940
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:59.020
<v Speaker 1>It's part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's part of their,</v>

941
00:47:59.021 --> 00:48:02.140
<v Speaker 1>the innate danger that's associated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>social organization.</v>

942
00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:05.740
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how do you keep the enterprise that</v>

943
00:48:05.741 --> 00:48:06.574
<v Speaker 1>you're part of alive and dynamic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>also keep it a place that a sensible </v>

944
00:48:10.901 --> 00:48:11.734
<v Speaker 1>person who's got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's got a proper orientation could </v>

945
00:48:14.531 --> 00:48:17.770
<v Speaker 1>stand to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is do not do things.</v>

946
00:48:17.771 --> 00:48:19.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be stupid.</v>

947
00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:20.920
<v Speaker 1>Stand up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

948
00:48:20.921 --> 00:48:22.210
<v Speaker 1>that's dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing it.</v>

949
00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:24.040
<v Speaker 1>And if they ask you why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can say,</v>

950
00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:25.840
<v Speaker 1>well a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's stupid.</v>

951
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.980
<v Speaker 1>B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I do it,</v>

952
00:48:26.981 --> 00:48:28.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get irritated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful.</v>

953
00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:29.793
<v Speaker 1>And also if I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to decrease my motivation so </v>

954
00:48:31.931 --> 00:48:34.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if they push you too hard,</v>

955
00:48:34.541 --> 00:48:35.590
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

956
00:48:35.650 --> 00:48:36.483
<v Speaker 1>it's time for a different job and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be the best thing that ever </v>

957
00:48:39.431 --> 00:48:42.760
<v Speaker 1>happened to you because if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the structure you're in is going in that</v>

958
00:48:42.761 --> 00:48:43.594
<v Speaker 1>direction and you can't stop it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like get the hell out of there and </v>

959
00:48:46.451 --> 00:48:49.900
<v Speaker 1>find something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not that hard to find a job when</v>

960
00:48:49.901 --> 00:48:50.734
<v Speaker 1>you already have a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing to keep in mind </v>

961
00:48:53.051 --> 00:48:53.950
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

962
00:48:53.951 --> 00:48:55.900
<v Speaker 1>when ever you're working and you will </v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

963
00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:57.453
<v Speaker 1>especially in the world that the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>of today where jobs are relatively </v>

964
00:49:00.401 --> 00:49:01.234
<v Speaker 1>uncertain is you should always have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>escape route plant and it should be </v>

965
00:49:04.991 --> 00:49:09.520
<v Speaker 1>active because if you don't have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>escape route and you can't get away,</v>

966
00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:10.960
<v Speaker 1>you can't say no.</v>

967
00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:13.750
<v Speaker 1>And if you can't say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't bargain.</v>

968
00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:16.300
<v Speaker 1>And if you can't bargain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a slave.</v>

969
00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:18.790
<v Speaker 1>So those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how it,</v>

970
00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:19.653
<v Speaker 1>that's how the world is set out at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment is probably always been like </v>

971
00:49:22.211 --> 00:49:23.044
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's something that you really need </v>

972
00:49:23.831 --> 00:49:25.990
<v Speaker 1>to know cause you got to watch if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

973
00:49:26.170 --> 00:49:31.150
<v Speaker 1>if you're being is objecting to someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>to something that someone is forcing you</v>

974
00:49:31.151 --> 00:49:33.670
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're right,</v>

975
00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:35.193
<v Speaker 1>maybe you shouldn't be doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And lots of people end up living </v>

976
00:49:37.571 --> 00:49:38.404
<v Speaker 1>meaningless lives and that that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a very good term because </v>

977
00:49:41.561 --> 00:49:46.030
<v Speaker 1>there's no such thing as a meaningless </v>
<v Speaker 1>life because one of the meanings of life</v>

978
00:49:46.031 --> 00:49:49.780
<v Speaker 1>is suffering and there's no bloody way </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to escape that.</v>

979
00:49:49.781 --> 00:49:50.614
<v Speaker 1>So you will not have a meaningless life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll have a life that's only </v>

980
00:49:53.681 --> 00:49:57.440
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I wouldn't recommend that because it</v>

981
00:49:57.441 --> 00:49:58.274
<v Speaker 1>will make you one miserable creature and</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus you'll warp everyone around you </v>

982
00:50:00.611 --> 00:50:02.050
<v Speaker 1>because you'll be vengeful.</v>

983
00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.480
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things are really important.</v>

984
00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:07.210
<v Speaker 1>They're really important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all right,</v>

985
00:50:07.211 --> 00:50:08.044
<v Speaker 1>so the individual as like culture and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like nature also has its negative </v>

986
00:50:11.171 --> 00:50:13.570
<v Speaker 1>element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would call that the shadow.</v>

987
00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:14.823
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to,</v>

988
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:15.783
<v Speaker 1>we're going to discuss the shadow in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some detail because one of the things </v>

989
00:50:18.431 --> 00:50:19.264
<v Speaker 1>that you believed and he kind of got </v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea from nature was that when you </v>

990
00:50:24.071 --> 00:50:26.710
<v Speaker 1>grow up and maybe as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your temperament,</v>

991
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:30.050
<v Speaker 1>you tend to think that some of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>attributes are good and some of them are</v>

992
00:50:30.051 --> 00:50:30.980
<v Speaker 1>negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

993
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:33.740
<v Speaker 1>so you make moral judgements about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Fair enough.</v>

994
00:50:33.741 --> 00:50:36.950
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think for the psychoanalysts,</v>

995
00:50:36.951 --> 00:50:41.951
<v Speaker 1>the two elements of human being that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're commonly regarded as negative from</v>

996
00:50:42.921 --> 00:50:43.754
<v Speaker 1>a moral perspective where sexuality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression and but humans of notion is </v>

997
00:50:48.411 --> 00:50:49.131
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

998
00:50:49.131 --> 00:50:49.964
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be someone who's modest and </v>

999
00:50:51.441 --> 00:50:53.990
<v Speaker 1>careful and never causes any conflict.</v>

1000
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:56.630
<v Speaker 1>And then we might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you're a well socialized person,</v>

1001
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:58.310
<v Speaker 1>but humans point would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1002
00:50:58.311 --> 00:51:00.830
<v Speaker 1>but you've got no power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got no power.</v>

1003
00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:03.260
<v Speaker 1>And so people are just going to roll </v>
<v Speaker 1>right over you.</v>

1004
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:04.303
<v Speaker 1>So you'd better dive into that morass of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality and aggression and pull out </v>

1005
00:51:07.941 --> 00:51:08.774
<v Speaker 1>those powers and integrate them into </v>
<v Speaker 1>your psyche so that you can use them </v>

1006
00:51:11.631 --> 00:51:14.690
<v Speaker 1>consciously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because without that you're harmless.</v>

1007
00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:15.883
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's a very good </v>

1008
00:51:17.271 --> 00:51:18.200
<v Speaker 1>ambition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1009
00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:19.850
<v Speaker 1>what do you want to be when you're 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1010
00:51:19.851 --> 00:51:21.380
<v Speaker 1>I want to be harmless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1011
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:23.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really that's what you want to be.</v>

1012
00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:26.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like you might as well not even be </v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's your goal.</v>

1013
00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:28.370
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1014
00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:29.233
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this dichotomy between the positive </v>

1015
00:51:30.651 --> 00:51:32.420
<v Speaker 1>individual and the negative individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1016
00:51:32.421 --> 00:51:33.254
<v Speaker 1>very complex because what's positive and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's negative is not obvious from the </v>

1017
00:51:36.651 --> 00:51:37.100
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>

1018
00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:37.933
<v Speaker 1>And arbitrary judgments don't help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult for a given </v>

1019
00:51:41.391 --> 00:51:43.910
<v Speaker 1>individual to look at themselves and </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1020
00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:45.013
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it about me that's actually </v>

1021
00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:49.860
<v Speaker 1>worth developing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can tie this into some degree into</v>

1022
00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:50.713
<v Speaker 1>big five theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the big five characteristics </v>

1023
00:51:53.511 --> 00:51:58.310
<v Speaker 1>is</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness safe.</v>

1024
00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:01.160
<v Speaker 1>And people tend to think of </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness has a virtue,</v>

1025
00:52:01.161 --> 00:52:01.994
<v Speaker 1>which is a complete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's completely idiotic to think that </v>

1026
00:52:03.651 --> 00:52:08.540
<v Speaker 1>because every virtue has its vice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But agreeable people are sympathetic and</v>

1027
00:52:08.541 --> 00:52:11.810
<v Speaker 1>empathetic and compassionate and polite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those all sound like good things.</v>

1028
00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:14.900
<v Speaker 1>But they're also part of being an </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] parent by the way.</v>

1029
00:52:14.901 --> 00:52:16.190
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>

1030
00:52:16.191 --> 00:52:17.024
<v Speaker 1>the problem with being agreeable is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people take advantage of you and then </v>

1031
00:52:19.911 --> 00:52:20.744
<v Speaker 1>you get resentful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm sure there's a whole pile of you </v>

1032
00:52:23.391 --> 00:52:25.130
<v Speaker 1>in here that are agreeable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful.</v>

1033
00:52:25.131 --> 00:52:26.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you know who you are.</v>

1034
00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:27.973
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I would mention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you should think about this cause </v>

1035
00:52:29.871 --> 00:52:33.620
<v Speaker 1>it'll help you a lot if you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that resentment is your best friend.</v>

1036
00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:38.270
<v Speaker 1>If something makes you resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do not do it.</v>

1037
00:52:38.810 --> 00:52:40.880
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or there's a more sophisticated rule,</v>

1038
00:52:40.881 --> 00:52:43.100
<v Speaker 1>which is if something makes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful,</v>

1039
00:52:43.101 --> 00:52:43.934
<v Speaker 1>there's only two possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is that you're sniffling and </v>

1040
00:52:46.581 --> 00:52:47.414
<v Speaker 1>immature and you won't adopt your </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities and you're whining </v>

1041
00:52:49.551 --> 00:52:50.384
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other is that you're being pushed </v>

1042
00:52:52.251 --> 00:52:54.440
<v Speaker 1>around and people are attempting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>enslave you.</v>

1043
00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:58.280
<v Speaker 1>So you want to eliminate the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility,</v>

1044
00:52:58.281 --> 00:52:59.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to think,</v>

1045
00:52:59.121 --> 00:53:00.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might just be an immature and whining</v>

1046
00:53:00.981 --> 00:53:01.814
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it something that people are </v>

1047
00:53:03.561 --> 00:53:04.394
<v Speaker 1>reasonably demanding of me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you think that through and maybe </v>

1048
00:53:07.381 --> 00:53:08.840
<v Speaker 1>you talked to some people about it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

1049
00:53:08.841 --> 00:53:09.171
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1050
00:53:09.171 --> 00:53:12.980
<v Speaker 1>this isn't reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the resentment is telling you act,</v>

1051
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:16.010
<v Speaker 1>act cause otherwise that's what you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

1052
00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:16.843
<v Speaker 1>You'll end up 15 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're married or </v>

1053
00:53:19.251 --> 00:53:23.330
<v Speaker 1>something like that with 8,000 things </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're resentful about and then you know</v>

1054
00:53:23.331 --> 00:53:26.130
<v Speaker 1>you'll be in some kind of painful </v>
<v Speaker 1>divorce that lasts for 10 years.</v>

1055
00:53:26.131 --> 00:53:26.964
<v Speaker 1>So better to nip it in the bud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone is after you to do something </v>

1056
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:31.703
<v Speaker 1>and you don't feel like you're getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>proper regard or proper response or you </v>

1057
00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:35.544
<v Speaker 1>don't think it's fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like have some courage and get </v>

1058
00:53:40.171 --> 00:53:43.290
<v Speaker 1>ahold of your anger and use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean you're right,</v>

1059
00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:44.453
<v Speaker 1>but at least it means you can push the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person hard enough so they have to </v>

1060
00:53:46.411 --> 00:53:49.650
<v Speaker 1>engage in a dialogue with you and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know this is,</v>

1061
00:53:49.651 --> 00:53:52.620
<v Speaker 1>these are necessary skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you cannot do this,</v>

1062
00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:54.840
<v Speaker 1>you have to be able to say no to </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiate.</v>

1063
00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:55.943
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to say no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you always want to put yourself in a </v>

1064
00:53:57.811 --> 00:54:00.420
<v Speaker 1>position where you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of being,</v>

1065
00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:01.313
<v Speaker 1>that's part of power and the other thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>is do not let people push you around </v>

1066
00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:05.693
<v Speaker 1>because you'll get pushed right into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>corner and you'll end up as a slave and </v>

1067
00:54:07.981 --> 00:54:11.670
<v Speaker 1>that's because there's tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slavery or negotiation.</v>

1068
00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:13.560
<v Speaker 1>That's what you've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1069
00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:22.200
<v Speaker 1>Then you're looking at it from the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

1070
00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1071
00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:28.550
<v Speaker 1>your level of analysis is wrong because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know it is society as a whole,</v>

1072
00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:31.200
<v Speaker 1>but what the hell good is that going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>

1073
00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:33.210
<v Speaker 1>you can't complain to society as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>

1074
00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:34.253
<v Speaker 1>You have to look for the micro </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestations that actually occur in </v>

1075
00:54:38.911 --> 00:54:39.744
<v Speaker 1>your realm and work on those and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the only level of analysis you have any </v>

1076
00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:45.053
<v Speaker 1>control over anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fix the things that are within your </v>

1077
00:54:47.821 --> 00:54:48.654
<v Speaker 1>realm of power and what will happen as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that is that your realm </v>

1078
00:54:51.721 --> 00:54:55.800
<v Speaker 1>of power will grow but you start local </v>
<v Speaker 1>because like what the hell do you know?</v>

1079
00:54:55.801 --> 00:54:58.410
<v Speaker 1>You're 19 or 20 or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like have,</v>

1080
00:54:58.560 --> 00:54:59.393
<v Speaker 1>you'll have a scrap with society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's just an architectural </v>

1081
00:55:01.771 --> 00:55:03.720
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>

1082
00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Because you don't know enough about </v>
<v Speaker 1>society to have that opinion.</v>

1083
00:55:07.350 --> 00:55:08.430
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not being,</v>

1084
00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:12.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm not being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to be cynical about this.</v>

1085
00:55:12.391 --> 00:55:14.400
<v Speaker 1>I am telling you that it's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>architectural problem.</v>

1086
00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:15.391
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

1087
00:55:15.391 --> 00:55:17.430
<v Speaker 1>everybody who is young has a problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>with society.</v>

1088
00:55:17.431 --> 00:55:20.880
<v Speaker 1>You're all at the bottom of the bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy unless you count the</v>

1089
00:55:20.881 --> 00:55:21.714
<v Speaker 1>entire rest of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which case you're already in the top </v>

1090
00:55:25.021 --> 00:55:27.150
<v Speaker 1>1% right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1091
00:55:27.151 --> 00:55:28.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where thinking about too.</v>

1092
00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:30.930
<v Speaker 1>So when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

1093
00:55:30.931 --> 00:55:35.430
<v Speaker 1>if you are in involved in a battle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense with society,</v>

1094
00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:36.713
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dominated by the figure of the </v>

1095
00:55:37.861 --> 00:55:40.650
<v Speaker 1>great father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the negative figure of the great father.</v>

1096
00:55:40.890 --> 00:55:43.740
<v Speaker 1>You also have to a lot of what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should do about that.</v>

1097
00:55:43.741 --> 00:55:46.530
<v Speaker 1>It's increased your level of gratitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1098
00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:48.660
<v Speaker 1>here you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's warm.</v>

1099
00:55:49.050 --> 00:55:51.360
<v Speaker 1>The chair works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The floor isn't going to fall apart,</v>

1100
00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:53.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're at a prestigious institution.</v>

1101
00:55:53.730 --> 00:55:57.810
<v Speaker 1>You're well on your way to being one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the top 1% in society.</v>

1102
00:55:57.811 --> 00:56:00.030
<v Speaker 1>You're just too damn in the young right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now for that to happen.</v>

1103
00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:02.100
<v Speaker 1>You're smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're healthy.</v>

1104
00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:03.053
<v Speaker 1>You're good looking except for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird thing you're wearing around your </v>

1105
00:56:05.071 --> 00:56:08.580
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

1106
00:56:08.581 --> 00:56:10.800
<v Speaker 1>you know what the hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1107
00:56:10.801 --> 00:56:13.620
<v Speaker 1>everything's good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

1108
00:56:13.621 --> 00:56:16.320
<v Speaker 1>I know there's a tyrannical element </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>

1109
00:56:16.321 --> 00:56:18.510
<v Speaker 1>It's real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1110
00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:21.720
<v Speaker 1>but if that's all you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1111
00:56:21.721 --> 00:56:24.430
<v Speaker 1>you're blinded and that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll warp you.</v>

1112
00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:26.830
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1113
00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:31.860
<v Speaker 1>so here's an example of how people </v>
<v Speaker 1>automatically see the world as animated.</v>

1114
00:56:31.991 --> 00:56:32.920
<v Speaker 1>So it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1115
00:56:32.921 --> 00:56:33.754
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I said we automatically perceive </v>

1116
00:56:34.871 --> 00:56:38.410
<v Speaker 1>the world in personifies category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's look at this.</v>

1117
00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:05.343
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1118
00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1119
00:57:26.831 --> 00:57:30.040
<v Speaker 1>So I would say that's the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the journey into the unconscious.</v>

1120
00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:31.870
<v Speaker 1>So that's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going,</v>

1121
00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:34.150
<v Speaker 1>what would you say into the underworld </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>

1122
00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:18.993
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing you notice that you </v>

1123
00:58:19.871 --> 00:58:21.220
<v Speaker 1>can all understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1124
00:58:21.221 --> 00:58:22.870
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like the world of </v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood,</v>

1125
00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:25.030
<v Speaker 1>but it makes sense for all those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>

1126
00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:25.893
<v Speaker 1>to be animated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to manifest themselves in personified </v>

1127
00:58:27.911 --> 00:58:29.020
<v Speaker 1>form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a way,</v>

1128
00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:29.913
<v Speaker 1>it's a way of looking at the world that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can really understand and it's a </v>

1129
00:58:32.411 --> 00:58:35.110
<v Speaker 1>natural way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry about that.</v>

1130
00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:38.710
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural way for children to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to look at the world.</v>

1131
00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:41.890
<v Speaker 1>All their books are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's animated because that's,</v>

1132
00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:42.993
<v Speaker 1>that's what they assume about the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the first understanding of the </v>

1133
00:58:45.281 --> 00:58:46.114
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the world of a place of </v>

1134
00:58:46.601 --> 00:58:47.434
<v Speaker 1>personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they have to move beyond that to </v>

1135
00:58:48.941 --> 00:58:51.850
<v Speaker 1>start developing some concept of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective world.</v>

1136
00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:54.190
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't even clear that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>

1137
00:58:54.490 --> 00:58:57.130
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1138
00:58:57.131 --> 00:59:01.540
<v Speaker 1>so now I would say that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call,</v>

1139
00:59:01.541 --> 00:59:06.541
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the symbolic structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>that represents the shamanic initiation.</v>

1140
00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:09.250
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to read something for male </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iata,</v>

1141
00:59:09.251 --> 00:59:10.810
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the readings that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

1142
00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:11.913
<v Speaker 1>I should like even now to stress the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that the psychopathology of the </v>

1143
00:59:14.081 --> 00:59:14.914
<v Speaker 1>shamanic vocation is not profane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does not belong to ordinary </v>

1144
00:59:17.741 --> 00:59:18.574
<v Speaker 1>symptomatology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what he's saying is that it's not </v>

1145
00:59:20.450 --> 00:59:21.283
<v Speaker 1>psychopathological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's part of normative personalities </v>

1146
00:59:23.331 --> 00:59:26.000
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has an initiatory structure,</v>

1147
00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:28.790
<v Speaker 1>significant and signification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In short,</v>

1148
00:59:28.791 --> 00:59:31.280
<v Speaker 1>it reproduces a traditional mystical </v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern.</v>

1149
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:32.503
<v Speaker 1>The total crisis of the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sharman sometimes leading to complete </v>

1150
00:59:35.541 --> 00:59:36.374
<v Speaker 1>disintegration of the personality and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>madness can be evaluated not only as an </v>

1151
00:59:39.951 --> 00:59:43.940
<v Speaker 1>initiatory death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also as a symbolic return to the pre</v>

1152
00:59:43.941 --> 00:59:44.774
<v Speaker 1>cosmic gornick chaos to the amorphous </v>
<v Speaker 1>and indescribable state that precedes </v>

1153
00:59:48.801 --> 00:59:53.300
<v Speaker 1>any cosmogony cause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Margariney is the account of the initial</v>

1154
00:59:53.301 --> 00:59:56.390
<v Speaker 1>creation of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the Judeo Christian tradition,</v>

1155
00:59:56.391 --> 00:59:59.000
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be the emergence of order out</v>

1156
00:59:59.001 --> 01:00:00.560
<v Speaker 1>of the initial state of chaos.</v>

1157
01:00:00.590 --> 01:00:02.890
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's produced by God's words.</v>

1158
01:00:02.891 --> 01:00:03.724
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's another symbolic </v>

1159
01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:06.770
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's chaos,</v>

1160
01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:09.140
<v Speaker 1>there's the active word and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>

1161
01:00:09.141 --> 01:00:11.870
<v Speaker 1>And those are the three initial elements</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being.</v>

1162
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:13.063
<v Speaker 1>And so the Sharman in some senses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reducing himself as a consequence of </v>

1163
01:00:15.861 --> 01:00:20.270
<v Speaker 1>exposure to something radical to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>initial components of his being.</v>

1164
01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:22.400
<v Speaker 1>And then being reconstructed out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1165
01:00:22.401 --> 01:00:24.890
<v Speaker 1>And that happens to you all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some sense,</v>

1166
01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:25.873
<v Speaker 1>when you encounter an obstacle that </v>
<v Speaker 1>really sets you back because you know </v>

1167
01:00:29.361 --> 01:00:30.194
<v Speaker 1>you've ordered the world and then what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you find out is the ordering of the </v>

1168
01:00:32.781 --> 01:00:33.614
<v Speaker 1>world is incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And before you can reorder it has to </v>

1169
01:00:36.291 --> 01:00:38.690
<v Speaker 1>become chaotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does become chaotic.</v>

1170
01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:39.733
<v Speaker 1>That's what sets you back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then out of that chaos you have to </v>

1171
01:00:42.321 --> 01:00:44.450
<v Speaker 1>bring out a new order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can't,</v>

1172
01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:46.070
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1173
01:00:46.071 --> 01:00:47.870
<v Speaker 1>you get betrayed by someone that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>

1174
01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:48.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1175
01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:52.190
<v Speaker 1>it's time to update your world model now</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you,</v>

1176
01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:54.380
<v Speaker 1>well maybe not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1177
01:00:54.381 --> 01:00:57.260
<v Speaker 1>because if you really update it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to come.</v>

1178
01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:01.340
<v Speaker 1>You have to come to terms with the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the individual,</v>

1179
01:01:01.341 --> 01:01:02.174
<v Speaker 1>which would also include you is capable </v>
<v Speaker 1>of radically immoral act because </v>

1180
01:01:07.731 --> 01:01:09.710
<v Speaker 1>betrayal is a radically immoral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>locked,</v>

1181
01:01:09.711 --> 01:01:10.544
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's any thing that's actually a </v>

1182
01:01:11.901 --> 01:01:12.734
<v Speaker 1>moral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's people telling you one thing and </v>

1183
01:01:14.511 --> 01:01:16.790
<v Speaker 1>then doing a whole bunch of other things</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind your back.</v>

1184
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:19.250
<v Speaker 1>And then that brings up a question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

1185
01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:21.320
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the hell can people be like that?</v>

1186
01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:22.483
<v Speaker 1>Especially because I'm also a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then also how can I be so naive and </v>

1187
01:01:25.461 --> 01:01:28.190
<v Speaker 1>moronic that that can happen to me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1188
01:01:28.191 --> 01:01:30.140
<v Speaker 1>and those are not trivial questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1189
01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:31.213
<v Speaker 1>if you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have an answer to them at </v>

1190
01:01:32.781 --> 01:01:33.614
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it means is that there's half the </v>

1191
01:01:35.391 --> 01:01:38.090
<v Speaker 1>world you haven't mapped out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be the negative half.</v>

1192
01:01:38.330 --> 01:01:39.163
<v Speaker 1>And you may have to revisit and revise </v>
<v Speaker 1>and destroy virtually all of your </v>

1193
01:01:42.801 --> 01:01:45.770
<v Speaker 1>assumptions about the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a reduction to chaos.</v>

1194
01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:46.723
<v Speaker 1>It is not fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if it happens accidentally </v>

1195
01:01:49.221 --> 01:01:52.430
<v Speaker 1>and it can be traumatic enough so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>never recover from it.</v>

1196
01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Post traumatic stress disorders like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1197
01:01:54.831 --> 01:01:58.370
<v Speaker 1>like if you watch soldiers in battle and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get post traumatic stress disorder,</v>

1198
01:01:58.550 --> 01:01:59.383
<v Speaker 1>it's very frequent that they get it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of something they did not </v>

1199
01:02:02.301 --> 01:02:03.800
<v Speaker 1>because of something that happened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1200
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:06.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're out on a mission of some sort</v>

1201
01:02:06.501 --> 01:02:08.540
<v Speaker 1>and they shoot a three year old child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1202
01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:11.570
<v Speaker 1>and maybe they do it consciously and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>

1203
01:02:11.571 --> 01:02:13.850
<v Speaker 1>they wake up after they do it and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1204
01:02:14.090 --> 01:02:15.920
<v Speaker 1>well that's not me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1205
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:19.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not the you that you think you</v>

1206
01:02:19.321 --> 01:02:23.130
<v Speaker 1>are and the you that did that man in </v>
<v Speaker 1>countering,</v>

1207
01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:25.410
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be enough to damage your</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

1208
01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:28.050
<v Speaker 1>And that is what happened to people with</v>
<v Speaker 1>post traumatic stress disorder.</v>

1209
01:02:28.051 --> 01:02:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Like it blows them apart so badly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not just psychologically right?</v>

1210
01:02:32.411 --> 01:02:35.010
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it radically alters them physiologically</v>

1211
01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:38.010
<v Speaker 1>their amygdalas grow in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>hippocampus by shrink.</v>

1212
01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:39.690
<v Speaker 1>If you have post traumatic stress </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder,</v>

1213
01:02:39.691 --> 01:02:43.050
<v Speaker 1>it's a whole brain transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's no joke.</v>

1214
01:02:43.410 --> 01:02:46.020
<v Speaker 1>And the human capacity for evil is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>deep that,</v>

1215
01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:47.430
<v Speaker 1>well young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1216
01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:48.680
<v Speaker 1>he thought that that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1217
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:49.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an accidental encounter with it was </v>

1218
01:02:50.971 --> 01:02:54.960
<v Speaker 1>enough to well enough to lead to madness</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some cases.</v>

1219
01:02:54.961 --> 01:02:57.450
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no joke.</v>

1220
01:02:58.570 --> 01:02:59.403
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's the way of thinking about </v>

1221
01:03:01.021 --> 01:03:01.854
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to move through it relatively </v>

1222
01:03:02.791 --> 01:03:03.624
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1223
01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:05.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look through the world,</v>

1224
01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:07.980
<v Speaker 1>you look at the world through a frame of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reference,</v>

1225
01:03:07.981 --> 01:03:08.814
<v Speaker 1>and the reason you do that in part is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's more to the world than </v>

1226
01:03:10.771 --> 01:03:11.700
<v Speaker 1>you can understand.</v>

1227
01:03:11.970 --> 01:03:14.370
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be the actual chaos of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

1228
01:03:14.371 --> 01:03:16.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like the world is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1229
01:03:16.231 --> 01:03:17.041
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1230
01:03:17.041 --> 01:03:18.870
<v Speaker 1>very complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1231
01:03:18.871 --> 01:03:19.704
<v Speaker 1>you're a very complicated too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not as complicated as the </v>

1232
01:03:21.841 --> 01:03:22.674
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're continually surrounded by a </v>

1233
01:03:24.271 --> 01:03:26.430
<v Speaker 1>chaotic structure that you don't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

1234
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:31.670
<v Speaker 1>And you have to frame it in with a frame</v>
<v Speaker 1>of reference that only allows you to see</v>

1235
01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:36.060
<v Speaker 1>those things that are necessary for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see at the time of your given action.</v>

1236
01:03:36.061 --> 01:03:36.894
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a cybernetic model of </v>

1237
01:03:38.431 --> 01:03:39.264
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The elements of that frame or something </v>

1238
01:03:41.371 --> 01:03:44.880
<v Speaker 1>like this is a basic story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are somewhere,</v>

1239
01:03:45.150 --> 01:03:47.430
<v Speaker 1>you're located somewhere in time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>

1240
01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:49.860
<v Speaker 1>always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know where that is and you have some</v>

1241
01:03:49.861 --> 01:03:52.440
<v Speaker 1>sense of the qualities of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>localization.</v>

1242
01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:55.470
<v Speaker 1>So people ask you about that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they ask you,</v>

1243
01:03:55.530 --> 01:03:56.700
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you doing?</v>

1244
01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:59.040
<v Speaker 1>And what they're asking is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1245
01:03:59.070 --> 01:04:01.770
<v Speaker 1>what's your representation of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>current state of being?</v>

1246
01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:05.100
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is generally for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1247
01:04:05.330 --> 01:04:06.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's okay,</v>

1248
01:04:06.361 --> 01:04:09.450
<v Speaker 1>but it's insufficient because if it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't insufficient,</v>

1249
01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:10.590
<v Speaker 1>while what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

1250
01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:11.453
<v Speaker 1>why would you be doing anything in any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in principle now isn't good enough </v>

1251
01:04:15.001 --> 01:04:17.490
<v Speaker 1>because there's something else that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be better.</v>

1252
01:04:17.491 --> 01:04:18.324
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you're pursuing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it's kind of a weird thing </v>

1253
01:04:20.371 --> 01:04:25.290
<v Speaker 1>because it means in some sense that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you weren't dissatisfied permanently,</v>

1254
01:04:25.830 --> 01:04:27.540
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't be motivated to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

1255
01:04:27.541 --> 01:04:28.374
<v Speaker 1>And so that's also part of the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of human being human </v>

1256
01:04:31.741 --> 01:04:34.530
<v Speaker 1>experience is characterized by somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative emotions.</v>

1257
01:04:34.531 --> 01:04:36.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're permanently dissatisfied.</v>

1258
01:04:37.110 --> 01:04:38.490
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1259
01:04:38.491 --> 01:04:42.630
<v Speaker 1>because we can act to change things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're not dissatisfied,</v>

1260
01:04:42.631 --> 01:04:44.640
<v Speaker 1>you don't want it to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense,</v>

1261
01:04:44.641 --> 01:04:45.474
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world through a frame that says this is </v>

1262
01:04:47.731 --> 01:04:52.731
<v Speaker 1>what there is and here's how I evaluated</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's what could be and that's what</v>

1263
01:04:52.891 --> 01:04:53.430
<v Speaker 1>I want.</v>

1264
01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:56.400
<v Speaker 1>I would like to bring that about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's uh,</v>

1265
01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:57.473
<v Speaker 1>that's what gives things value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives things value because things </v>

1266
01:05:00.841 --> 01:05:02.490
<v Speaker 1>that will move you to where you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

1267
01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:03.473
<v Speaker 1>they have a positive value and things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that get in your way when you're trying </v>

1268
01:05:06.211 --> 01:05:08.640
<v Speaker 1>to get to where you want to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a negative value.</v>

1269
01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:10.980
<v Speaker 1>And so that's partly how your emotions </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

1270
01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:13.440
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can put almost anything in the,</v>

1271
01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:17.770
<v Speaker 1>in the box of what should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird because normally animals,</v>

1272
01:05:17.771 --> 01:05:19.360
<v Speaker 1>what would be in the box of what should </v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

1273
01:05:19.361 --> 01:05:23.410
<v Speaker 1>would be deep motivational states that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are biological in origin.</v>

1274
01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:25.510
<v Speaker 1>So maybe an animal hasn't had enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>

1275
01:05:25.690 --> 01:05:27.580
<v Speaker 1>And so park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's feeling hungry.</v>

1276
01:05:27.581 --> 01:05:30.490
<v Speaker 1>That's undesirable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wants to have something to eat.</v>

1277
01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:31.533
<v Speaker 1>And so these different underlying </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological systems like hunger and </v>

1278
01:05:34.241 --> 01:05:35.074
<v Speaker 1>thirst and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sexual lost and aggression and </v>

1279
01:05:37.031 --> 01:05:38.650
<v Speaker 1>temperature regulation and so on.</v>

1280
01:05:38.810 --> 01:05:41.800
<v Speaker 1>There are what set the goals and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptual frame.</v>

1281
01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:44.080
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the emotional responses.</v>

1282
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:48.130
<v Speaker 1>But in human beings we're so damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstract that we can take that structure</v>

1283
01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.590
<v Speaker 1>and we can put almost anything in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal box.</v>

1284
01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:51.933
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go to a soccer game and you can </v>

1285
01:05:54.071 --> 01:05:54.904
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1286
01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:55.893
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to identify with my team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you expand the boundaries of your </v>

1287
01:05:58.901 --> 01:06:01.690
<v Speaker 1>current state of existence to </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporate the team.</v>

1288
01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:02.980
<v Speaker 1>And then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1289
01:06:02.981 --> 01:06:03.814
<v Speaker 1>it's really important to me that these </v>
<v Speaker 1>kicked that little round sphere through </v>

1290
01:06:05.831 --> 01:06:08.410
<v Speaker 1>that net.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so your whole nervous system says,</v>

1291
01:06:08.411 --> 01:06:10.030
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if that's the goal,</v>

1292
01:06:10.031 --> 01:06:12.340
<v Speaker 1>we're going to align our emotions with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1293
01:06:12.341 --> 01:06:14.500
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys you don't know,</v>

1294
01:06:14.501 --> 01:06:15.334
<v Speaker 1>run down the field and kick a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>sphere through a nat and you're like up </v>

1295
01:06:18.851 --> 01:06:19.840
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1296
01:06:19.841 --> 01:06:23.050
<v Speaker 1>and celebrating in a way that you'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>never do in your actual life.</v>

1297
01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:26.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't do that when you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good grade on an exam,</v>

1298
01:06:26.831 --> 01:06:27.664
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jump up in the air and hug all your </v>

1299
01:06:28.721 --> 01:06:29.500
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1300
01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:30.333
<v Speaker 1>you'll do that at a soccer game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what the Hell is wrong with </v>

1301
01:06:33.041 --> 01:06:34.150
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1302
01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:35.133
<v Speaker 1>but you do that because this is a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>malleable and extendable frame and </v>

1303
01:06:39.221 --> 01:06:43.210
<v Speaker 1>you're using it for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you go into a movie theater and you</v>

1304
01:06:43.211 --> 01:06:44.044
<v Speaker 1>watched the protagonist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you basically adopt his or her frame of </v>

1305
01:06:46.991 --> 01:06:47.824
<v Speaker 1>reference and then you see the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>world that's portrayed on the screen </v>

1306
01:06:50.530 --> 01:06:51.363
<v Speaker 1>through the eyes of the person that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're identifying with as part of our </v>

1307
01:06:53.741 --> 01:06:56.840
<v Speaker 1>capacity for imitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically what you do,</v>

1308
01:06:56.841 --> 01:06:57.674
<v Speaker 1>what it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do there is like if you're </v>

1309
01:06:58.991 --> 01:07:02.320
<v Speaker 1>talking to someone else and you adopt </v>
<v Speaker 1>their frame of reference,</v>

1310
01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:07.500
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly a cognitive operation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you seem to do is first of all come</v>

1311
01:07:07.521 --> 01:07:11.350
<v Speaker 1>with to some understanding about what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they want.</v>

1312
01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:14.260
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you know what they want,</v>

1313
01:07:14.261 --> 01:07:15.094
<v Speaker 1>you can represent them in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost like you're playing them </v>

1314
01:07:18.251 --> 01:07:21.160
<v Speaker 1>as a simulation on your own biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>plot form.</v>

1315
01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:26.080
<v Speaker 1>And then you can infer from your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional responses if you also simulate</v>

1316
01:07:26.081 --> 01:07:28.690
<v Speaker 1>the situation that they're in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what their emotions are.</v>

1317
01:07:28.691 --> 01:07:30.590
<v Speaker 1>And that enables you to understand other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's.</v>

1318
01:07:30.591 --> 01:07:31.424
<v Speaker 1>So were these weird biological computers</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are capable of running other </v>

1319
01:07:35.111 --> 01:07:35.944
<v Speaker 1>psyches on our biological platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that makes us able to imitate and </v>

1320
01:07:38.951 --> 01:07:42.640
<v Speaker 1>also to understand each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a basic narrative.</v>

1321
01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:43.713
<v Speaker 1>I was here and I'm trying to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're asking your </v>

1322
01:07:46.961 --> 01:07:47.794
<v Speaker 1>kindergarten kid what they did today at </v>
<v Speaker 1>school and teaching them to tell a </v>

1323
01:07:50.591 --> 01:07:51.790
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might say,</v>

1324
01:07:51.791 --> 01:07:52.624
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at home and then mom took me to </v>

1325
01:07:54.611 --> 01:07:56.950
<v Speaker 1>kindergarten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like not a very exciting story,</v>

1326
01:07:56.951 --> 01:07:57.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's a story.</v>

1327
01:07:58.090 --> 01:07:59.830
<v Speaker 1>And then a little more exciting story </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be,</v>

1328
01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:02.253
<v Speaker 1>I was at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom took me to school and on the way </v>

1329
01:08:04.121 --> 01:08:04.954
<v Speaker 1>there a big dog ran up to the fence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>barked out me and the right question </v>

1330
01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:11.380
<v Speaker 1>that would follow that story is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1331
01:08:11.381 --> 01:08:12.214
<v Speaker 1>what did you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a real story because the kid </v>

1332
01:08:14.561 --> 01:08:15.231
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

1333
01:08:15.231 --> 01:08:16.064
<v Speaker 1>I was in this frame of reference and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was aiming at goal a b actually I was </v>

1334
01:08:20.751 --> 01:08:21.584
<v Speaker 1>aiming at point b and while I was aiming</v>
<v Speaker 1>at point b an acting out the processes </v>

1335
01:08:25.701 --> 01:08:29.000
<v Speaker 1>that would lead me there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something unexpected happened.</v>

1336
01:08:29.810 --> 01:08:31.580
<v Speaker 1>That's a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you say,</v>

1337
01:08:31.581 --> 01:08:33.740
<v Speaker 1>well what did you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the kid might say,</v>

1338
01:08:33.741 --> 01:08:34.161
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1339
01:08:34.161 --> 01:08:38.480
<v Speaker 1>I was really scared and I hid behind mum</v>
<v Speaker 1>or so that would be one response.</v>

1340
01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:41.450
<v Speaker 1>And we still went to kindergarten and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was okay,</v>

1341
01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:42.770
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty good.</v>

1342
01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:43.813
<v Speaker 1>Or The kid might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I wasn't scared at all because I </v>

1343
01:08:45.591 --> 01:08:48.230
<v Speaker 1>know that if you stand up to dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they usually leave you alone.</v>

1344
01:08:48.530 --> 01:08:50.270
<v Speaker 1>And we went to kindergarten and that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1345
01:08:50.271 --> 01:08:52.970
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kid is trying to tell really they're</v>

1346
01:08:52.971 --> 01:08:53.804
<v Speaker 1>trying to tell a little hero story and </v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're successful in the accounter </v>

1347
01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:57.883
<v Speaker 1>with the thing that's unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they try on as a consequence of </v>

1348
01:09:00.471 --> 01:09:02.750
<v Speaker 1>their encounter with the unexpected and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Poof,</v>

1349
01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:04.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's successful out of pace.</v>

1350
01:09:04.261 --> 01:09:05.720
<v Speaker 1>You Pat them on the head and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1351
01:09:05.721 --> 01:09:08.410
<v Speaker 1>no that's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kind of smile and you know,</v>

1352
01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:09.253
<v Speaker 1>you're teaching them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're teaching them how to comprehend </v>

1353
01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:13.963
<v Speaker 1>their existence in a narrative structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're also teaching them what that </v>

1354
01:09:16.491 --> 01:09:20.150
<v Speaker 1>narrative structure should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is like a Meta narrative and the</v>

1355
01:09:20.151 --> 01:09:23.450
<v Speaker 1>Meta narrative says you were going from </v>
<v Speaker 1>point a to point b.</v>

1356
01:09:23.570 --> 01:09:24.403
<v Speaker 1>That's the oval on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then something completely bizarre </v>

1357
01:09:27.471 --> 01:09:28.304
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was betrayed and then I was in </v>

1358
01:09:31.191 --> 01:09:34.040
<v Speaker 1>this terrible place for quite a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>period of time,</v>

1359
01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:35.053
<v Speaker 1>a chaotic place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I learned a bunch and I put myself </v>

1360
01:09:38.121 --> 01:09:42.350
<v Speaker 1>back together and I'm a wiser person as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a consequence of the encounter.</v>

1361
01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:45.530
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows that story.</v>

1362
01:09:45.710 --> 01:09:48.380
<v Speaker 1>And that's paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paradise lost,</v>

1363
01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:52.500
<v Speaker 1>paradise regained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a cultural meta-narrative and,</v>

1364
01:09:52.510 --> 01:09:56.090
<v Speaker 1>and it's a story that every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's a human story.</v>

1365
01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:57.103
<v Speaker 1>It's an apocalyptic story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why everybody's always all </v>

1366
01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:01.340
<v Speaker 1>apocalyptic about everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1367
01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:04.280
<v Speaker 1>Apocalypse of the week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to run out of oil.</v>

1368
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:07.250
<v Speaker 1>We're going to run out of gas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's too much carbon dioxide.</v>

1369
01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:09.050
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese are going to take over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1370
01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:11.540
<v Speaker 1>We're ruining the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're ruining the ecology,</v>

1371
01:10:11.690 --> 01:10:13.670
<v Speaker 1>the oceans running out of fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1372
01:10:13.671 --> 01:10:14.504
<v Speaker 1>the world is getting too hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was getting too cold in 1970 when I </v>

1373
01:10:17.331 --> 01:10:18.320
<v Speaker 1>was about your age.</v>

1374
01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:21.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like apocalypse of the week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1375
01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:22.753
<v Speaker 1>Because things fall apart and because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can fall apart completely and they </v>

1376
01:10:26.661 --> 01:10:27.494
<v Speaker 1>often do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so everyone's always on the alert </v>

1377
01:10:29.571 --> 01:10:32.750
<v Speaker 1>for like the next potential apocalypse </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's no wonder,</v>

1378
01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:33.733
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a permanent characteristic of life </v>

1379
01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:36.883
<v Speaker 1>that things can radically fallen apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Luckily it's a permanent </v>

1380
01:10:39.801 --> 01:10:40.634
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of life that they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually also radically come back </v>

1381
01:10:43.281 --> 01:10:44.114
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out that whether or not </v>

1382
01:10:45.951 --> 01:10:49.670
<v Speaker 1>they radically come together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depends to some degree on how you choose</v>

1383
01:10:49.671 --> 01:10:54.671
<v Speaker 1>to act when they fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the pre cosmic Garnett chaos.</v>

1384
01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:56.940
<v Speaker 1>This is from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1385
01:10:58.070 --> 01:11:00.110
<v Speaker 1>William James,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a pragmatist,</v>

1386
01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:03.140
<v Speaker 1>lived on the east coast at about the end</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the 18 hundreds.</v>

1387
01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:05.240
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the founders of modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>

1388
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:09.170
<v Speaker 1>He likes to sniff nitric nitrous oxide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a hallucinogen.</v>

1389
01:11:09.171 --> 01:11:13.290
<v Speaker 1>He was sort of like the world's first </v>
<v Speaker 1>major league hippie and he wrote sort of</v>

1390
01:11:13.291 --> 01:11:17.190
<v Speaker 1>hippie poetry as a consequence of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>nitrous oxide experimentation.</v>

1391
01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:20.910
<v Speaker 1>And here's part of what a he derived </v>
<v Speaker 1>from his experiences.</v>

1392
01:11:20.911 --> 01:11:22.120
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1393
01:11:22.230 --> 01:11:23.063
<v Speaker 1>pure experience is the name which I give</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the original flux of life before </v>

1394
01:11:27.061 --> 01:11:27.894
<v Speaker 1>reflection has categorized it only </v>
<v Speaker 1>newborn babes and persons in semi coma </v>

1395
01:11:31.381 --> 01:11:32.400
<v Speaker 1>from sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>

1396
01:11:32.401 --> 01:11:33.234
<v Speaker 1>illnesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or blows can have an experience pure in </v>

1397
01:11:35.401 --> 01:11:36.234
<v Speaker 1>the literal sense of awe that which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not yet any definite what potential </v>

1398
01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:45.210
<v Speaker 1>potential cause he might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1399
01:11:45.211 --> 01:11:48.270
<v Speaker 1>what's the world made of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's made out of actuality,</v>

1400
01:11:48.690 --> 01:11:50.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not how you act.</v>

1401
01:11:50.401 --> 01:11:51.234
<v Speaker 1>You Act as if the world's made out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential and you interact with that </v>

1402
01:11:53.971 --> 01:11:54.804
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what James is saying is that there </v>

1403
01:11:56.491 --> 01:11:57.324
<v Speaker 1>are times when you experience something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's akin to relatively pure </v>

1404
01:12:01.261 --> 01:12:02.094
<v Speaker 1>potential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you might ask yourself whether </v>

1405
01:12:03.871 --> 01:12:06.930
<v Speaker 1>or not potential is real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a really interesting question,</v>

1406
01:12:07.170 --> 01:12:10.170
<v Speaker 1>but I can say regardless of how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer that question,</v>

1407
01:12:10.171 --> 01:12:14.490
<v Speaker 1>you act as if it's real and you'll also </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel guilty of someone that you love,</v>

1408
01:12:14.491 --> 01:12:18.150
<v Speaker 1>comes up to you and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not living up to your potential.</v>

1409
01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:19.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell does that mean?</v>

1410
01:12:20.370 --> 01:12:21.203
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means you're not becoming that which </v>

1411
01:12:23.821 --> 01:12:25.710
<v Speaker 1>you could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1412
01:12:25.711 --> 01:12:26.910
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1413
01:12:26.911 --> 01:12:28.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're materialists.</v>

1414
01:12:28.051 --> 01:12:30.150
<v Speaker 1>How are we going to measure that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't touch it.</v>

1415
01:12:30.151 --> 01:12:31.890
<v Speaker 1>You can't taste it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't see it.</v>

1416
01:12:31.891 --> 01:12:33.960
<v Speaker 1>You can't measure it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1417
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:35.090
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nonetheless,</v>

1418
01:12:35.130 --> 01:12:35.963
<v Speaker 1>it's like the substance of being and </v>
<v Speaker 1>being his potential as well as </v>

1419
01:12:39.631 --> 01:12:40.464
<v Speaker 1>actuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're grappling always with the </v>

1420
01:12:42.241 --> 01:12:43.074
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what James is talking </v>

1421
01:12:44.581 --> 01:12:45.810
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pure potential.</v>

1422
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.823
<v Speaker 1>I like to think of it as latent </v>
<v Speaker 1>information full both of oneness and </v>

1423
01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:51.513
<v Speaker 1>menace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in respects that don't appear </v>

1424
01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:56.610
<v Speaker 1>changing throughout yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So confusedly that it's phases.</v>

1425
01:12:56.611 --> 01:12:57.444
<v Speaker 1>Interpenetrate sounds like the Yin and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Yang symbol and no points either of </v>

1426
01:13:00.871 --> 01:13:03.660
<v Speaker 1>distinction or of identity can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>caught.</v>

1427
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:06.263
<v Speaker 1>Here's his poem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No verbiage can give it because the </v>

1428
01:13:09.241 --> 01:13:10.074
<v Speaker 1>verbiage is other incoherent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coherent the same and it fades and it's </v>

1429
01:13:15.930 --> 01:13:17.790
<v Speaker 1>infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's infinite.</v>

1430
01:13:17.970 --> 01:13:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Don't you see the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you see the identity constantly?</v>

1431
01:13:21.811 --> 01:13:22.644
<v Speaker 1>Opposites united the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me telling you to write and not to </v>

1432
01:13:25.171 --> 01:13:26.730
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Extreme,</v>

1433
01:13:27.150 --> 01:13:28.950
<v Speaker 1>extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme something.</v>

1434
01:13:28.951 --> 01:13:29.784
<v Speaker 1>And other than that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intoxication and otherness than </v>

1435
01:13:32.221 --> 01:13:34.920
<v Speaker 1>intoxication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every attempted betterment,</v>

1436
01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:36.233
<v Speaker 1>every attempted other men is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it fades and it fades forever and </v>

1437
01:13:40.561 --> 01:13:41.730
<v Speaker 1>forever as we move.</v>

1438
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.863
<v Speaker 1>Elliot says now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we know for archaic and traditional </v>

1439
01:13:47.731 --> 01:13:48.564
<v Speaker 1>cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the symbolic return to chaos is </v>

1440
01:13:49.621 --> 01:13:50.454
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to preparing a new creation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the death of your current state of </v>

1441
01:13:54.001 --> 01:13:56.310
<v Speaker 1>being can be the preparation for a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

1442
01:13:56.311 --> 01:13:58.770
<v Speaker 1>Now one of the things the psychoanalysts</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1443
01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:02.340
<v Speaker 1>and this is implicit in Elliot's </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion of the show transformation,</v>

1444
01:14:02.341 --> 01:14:03.174
<v Speaker 1>is if you do this voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a much better chance of doing </v>

1445
01:14:07.951 --> 01:14:10.260
<v Speaker 1>it successfully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the rule is,</v>

1446
01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:11.213
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go to hunt for a dragon and </v>

1447
01:14:13.151 --> 01:14:15.610
<v Speaker 1>you're in pretty good shape while you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it and you're all prepared,</v>

1448
01:14:15.611 --> 01:14:16.444
<v Speaker 1>then the damn thing might not eat you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're lying in bed and you know </v>

1449
01:14:18.911 --> 01:14:20.560
<v Speaker 1>you're covered with cheesy dust and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

1450
01:14:20.710 --> 01:14:23.050
<v Speaker 1>you're hung over from three days worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>of drinking,</v>

1451
01:14:23.290 --> 01:14:24.670
<v Speaker 1>then the dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just eat you.</v>

1452
01:14:24.671 --> 01:14:26.800
<v Speaker 1>And it's probably a good thing for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone that it did.</v>

1453
01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:30.340
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the point is be prepared.</v>

1454
01:14:30.341 --> 01:14:34.690
<v Speaker 1>And part of the way that you're prepared</v>
<v Speaker 1>is by being awake and having the,</v>

1455
01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:35.623
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1456
01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:36.633
<v Speaker 1>many sources of power that are at your </v>
<v Speaker 1>fingertips that are part of your </v>

1457
01:14:40.811 --> 01:14:45.610
<v Speaker 1>biological and cultural inheritance at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the ready so that you can respond.</v>

1458
01:14:46.970 --> 01:14:47.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1459
01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:50.330
<v Speaker 1>it follows that we may interpret the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychic chaos of the future.</v>

1460
01:14:50.331 --> 01:14:53.930
<v Speaker 1>Sharman has a sign that the profane man </v>
<v Speaker 1>is being dissolved and a new personality</v>

1461
01:14:53.931 --> 01:14:58.931
<v Speaker 1>being prepared for birth transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constant theme,</v>

1462
01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:00.800
<v Speaker 1>Paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paradise,</v>

1463
01:15:00.801 --> 01:15:04.610
<v Speaker 1>lost and redemption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the story of mankind.</v>

1464
01:15:04.611 --> 01:15:06.470
<v Speaker 1>We're in a fallen state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

1465
01:15:06.471 --> 01:15:07.304
<v Speaker 1>While,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because things aren't perfect and they </v>

1466
01:15:08.211 --> 01:15:10.280
<v Speaker 1>could be better and everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>

1467
01:15:10.670 --> 01:15:11.503
<v Speaker 1>So things have fallen apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're always in the state of being </v>

1468
01:15:14.391 --> 01:15:16.670
<v Speaker 1>fallen apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what are we trying to do?</v>

1469
01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:18.740
<v Speaker 1>What we're trying to put them back </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

1470
01:15:19.190 --> 01:15:21.590
<v Speaker 1>That's the eternal story of mankind </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1471
01:15:24.850 --> 01:15:25.683
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1472
01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:31.120
<v Speaker 1>Now on [inaudible] who was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>existentialist psychotherapist,</v>

1473
01:15:31.730 --> 01:15:32.563
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who is a leader of the </v>

1474
01:15:33.951 --> 01:15:34.784
<v Speaker 1>existentialist movement in the 1950s and</v>
<v Speaker 1>also a profound student of </v>

1475
01:15:37.371 --> 01:15:40.880
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychoanalysis talked about something he</v>

1476
01:15:40.881 --> 01:15:41.714
<v Speaker 1>characterized as a creative illness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was something that manifested </v>

1477
01:15:44.451 --> 01:15:45.284
<v Speaker 1>itself in Freud and in [inaudible] and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in other people like Viktor Frankl for </v>

1478
01:15:49.491 --> 01:15:50.324
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who went through periods of extreme and </v>

1479
01:15:52.281 --> 01:15:53.114
<v Speaker 1>Darwin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme periods of chaotic disruption </v>

1480
01:15:55.401 --> 01:15:59.480
<v Speaker 1>has their new theories were manifesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves because the new theories tore</v>

1481
01:15:59.481 --> 01:16:00.314
<v Speaker 1>them apart as they were being developed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they paid a tremendous personal </v>

1482
01:16:03.141 --> 01:16:03.974
<v Speaker 1>price for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But generally they were able to </v>

1483
01:16:05.481 --> 01:16:08.390
<v Speaker 1>reorganize themselves within the context</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the new theory.</v>

1484
01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:09.433
<v Speaker 1>And that made their stance more powerful</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more complete than it was before he </v>

1485
01:16:13.191 --> 01:16:16.340
<v Speaker 1>described the characteristic elements of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the creative illnesses follows.</v>

1486
01:16:16.670 --> 01:16:17.503
<v Speaker 1>It succeeds a period of intense </v>
<v Speaker 1>preoccupation with an idea and search </v>

1487
01:16:21.051 --> 01:16:21.884
<v Speaker 1>for a certain truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a polymorphous condition that can </v>

1488
01:16:24.531 --> 01:16:26.630
<v Speaker 1>take the shape of depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neurosis,</v>

1489
01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:29.780
<v Speaker 1>psychosomatic ailments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even psychosis,</v>

1490
01:16:30.170 --> 01:16:32.420
<v Speaker 1>whatever the symptoms they are felt as </v>
<v Speaker 1>painful,</v>

1491
01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:33.254
<v Speaker 1>if not agonizing by the subject with </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternating periods of alleviation and </v>

1492
01:16:36.411 --> 01:16:37.244
<v Speaker 1>worsening throughout the illness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The subject never loses the thread of </v>

1493
01:16:40.611 --> 01:16:41.444
<v Speaker 1>his dominating preoccupation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's often compatible with normal </v>

1494
01:16:44.511 --> 01:16:46.460
<v Speaker 1>professional activity and family life,</v>

1495
01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:50.740
<v Speaker 1>but even if he keeps to his social </v>
<v Speaker 1>activities,</v>

1496
01:16:50.741 --> 01:16:52.900
<v Speaker 1>he's almost entirely absorbed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

1497
01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:54.303
<v Speaker 1>He suffers from feelings of isolation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when he has a mentor who guides </v>

1498
01:16:58.451 --> 01:17:02.170
<v Speaker 1>them through the ordeal like the showman</v>
<v Speaker 1>apprentice with his master,</v>

1499
01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:06.580
<v Speaker 1>the termination is often rapid and </v>
<v Speaker 1>marked by a phase of exhilaration.</v>

1500
01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:07.833
<v Speaker 1>The subject emerges from his ordeal with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a permanent transformation in his </v>

1501
01:17:10.341 --> 01:17:11.174
<v Speaker 1>personality and the conviction that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>has discovered a great truth or a new </v>

1502
01:17:13.971 --> 01:17:16.490
<v Speaker 1>spiritual world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also happened to piaget.</v>

1503
01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:18.163
<v Speaker 1>Many of the 19th and 20th century </v>
<v Speaker 1>figures recognized universally is great </v>

1504
01:17:22.530 --> 01:17:23.450
<v Speaker 1>niche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Darwin,</v>

1505
01:17:23.451 --> 01:17:24.680
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tolstoy,</v>

1506
01:17:24.681 --> 01:17:27.440
<v Speaker 1>Freud Young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're also additionally characterized by</v>

1507
01:17:27.441 --> 01:17:30.830
<v Speaker 1>lengthy periods of profound </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological unrest and uncertainty.</v>

1508
01:17:32.210 --> 01:17:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Here's our dream that my daughter had </v>
<v Speaker 1>when she was three,</v>

1509
01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:36.380
<v Speaker 1>and this is quite a cool dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I caught it.</v>

1510
01:17:36.381 --> 01:17:39.350
<v Speaker 1>I was able to write it down verbatim </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was writing at the time.</v>

1511
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:40.183
<v Speaker 1>So she came in to tell me this dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I typed it out because it's not that </v>

1512
01:17:42.831 --> 01:17:45.740
<v Speaker 1>easy to catch a kid's dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here was the situation.</v>

1513
01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:49.160
<v Speaker 1>So when we brought her brother home from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hospital,</v>

1514
01:17:49.161 --> 01:17:51.700
<v Speaker 1>he is two years younger than her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't know,</v>

1515
01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:52.593
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's less than a three year gap </v>

1516
01:17:53.871 --> 01:17:54.704
<v Speaker 1>between siblings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a high probability of sibling </v>

1517
01:17:56.331 --> 01:17:59.510
<v Speaker 1>rivalry because the old siblings still </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs a lot of attention.</v>

1518
01:17:59.511 --> 01:18:02.480
<v Speaker 1>But you know when you have a two year </v>
<v Speaker 1>old you think man that's a baby.</v>

1519
01:18:02.481 --> 01:18:05.750
<v Speaker 1>But when you bring a newborn baby home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that two year olds in adult,</v>

1520
01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:09.290
<v Speaker 1>like there's such a radical difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between a newborn and a two year old.</v>

1521
01:18:09.291 --> 01:18:11.030
<v Speaker 1>And so it's hard on the two year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1522
01:18:11.031 --> 01:18:11.864
<v Speaker 1>Cause they have to grow up right away </v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe they don't get as much </v>

1523
01:18:13.251 --> 01:18:15.470
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we taught her to,</v>

1524
01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:19.460
<v Speaker 1>we taught her to come for a hug when she</v>
<v Speaker 1>needed to by practicing that.</v>

1525
01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.530
<v Speaker 1>And we also prepared her and told her </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1526
01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:22.393
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was going to be some trouble but </v>

1527
01:18:23.390 --> 01:18:25.280
<v Speaker 1>she could get some attention from this </v>
<v Speaker 1>new baby.</v>

1528
01:18:25.281 --> 01:18:27.890
<v Speaker 1>And that was also her baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she was all prepared for that.</v>

1529
01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:28.783
<v Speaker 1>So she took a lot of care of that baby </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she thought it was her baby and she </v>

1530
01:18:32.481 --> 01:18:35.870
<v Speaker 1>liked this baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so she called him baby and then,</v>

1531
01:18:35.871 --> 01:18:37.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started to toddle around and,</v>

1532
01:18:37.970 --> 01:18:40.220
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we told her one day,</v>

1533
01:18:40.221 --> 01:18:41.910
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was being toilet trained.</v>

1534
01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:42.830
<v Speaker 1>We said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1535
01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Mckayla,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not really a baby anymore.</v>

1536
01:18:45.530 --> 01:18:47.300
<v Speaker 1>And she didn't like that because she </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

1537
01:18:47.330 --> 01:18:48.740
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that baby.</v>

1538
01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:52.400
<v Speaker 1>And now whatever this creature is </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently is not that baby.</v>

1539
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:54.170
<v Speaker 1>And so what am I supposed to do about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1540
01:18:54.171 --> 01:18:55.004
<v Speaker 1>And not as a profound question because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are lots of parents who don't let </v>

1541
01:18:57.981 --> 01:18:58.814
<v Speaker 1>their children progressed past the stage</v>
<v Speaker 1>of baby because they don't want to lose </v>

1542
01:19:02.301 --> 01:19:03.134
<v Speaker 1>the baby.</v>

1543
01:19:03.710 --> 01:19:06.260
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like she was onto something </v>
<v Speaker 1>major.</v>

1544
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:07.970
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1545
01:19:11.570 --> 01:19:13.880
<v Speaker 1>so this is what she said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is your dream.</v>

1546
01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:16.280
<v Speaker 1>Julian is the name of her little </v>
<v Speaker 1>brother.</v>

1547
01:19:16.281 --> 01:19:17.114
<v Speaker 1>Julian's eyes fall down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he falled into pieces and I </v>

1548
01:19:20.271 --> 01:19:20.711
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1549
01:19:20.711 --> 01:19:23.660
<v Speaker 1>what sort of piece is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she said Julian pieces.</v>

1550
01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:24.613
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1551
01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:29.390
<v Speaker 1>And then his bones falled out too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then a whole goddess and there was water</v>

1552
01:19:29.391 --> 01:19:30.224
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when he came out he was big and my </v>

1553
01:19:32.151 --> 01:19:34.280
<v Speaker 1>wife said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Julian isn't a baby anymore.</v>

1554
01:19:34.430 --> 01:19:35.630
<v Speaker 1>And Mckinley said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1555
01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:36.493
<v Speaker 1>he's a big boy and above with legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got Him out cause bugs can swim and the </v>

1556
01:19:39.831 --> 01:19:40.664
<v Speaker 1>hole was in the park and the park and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>moved into the backyard and he felt he </v>

1557
01:19:44.601 --> 01:19:47.180
<v Speaker 1>falled in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A tree burned and left the hole.</v>

1558
01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:51.160
<v Speaker 1>So that was pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like grade three,</v>

1559
01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:52.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three year old kid.</v>

1560
01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:54.090
<v Speaker 1>And so the park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they started,</v>

1561
01:19:54.091 --> 01:19:57.170
<v Speaker 1>her place was 42 acres and it was like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>real forest and park.</v>

1562
01:19:57.171 --> 01:19:59.570
<v Speaker 1>And I used to take the kids there like </v>
<v Speaker 1>at twilight and you know,</v>

1563
01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:03.380
<v Speaker 1>we'd creep around in there and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty scary and exciting for them.</v>

1564
01:20:03.381 --> 01:20:05.360
<v Speaker 1>So it was sort of an ex gary and </v>
<v Speaker 1>exciting place.</v>

1565
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:08.730
<v Speaker 1>It was full of trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it was the unknown outside of our</v>

1566
01:20:08.731 --> 01:20:11.130
<v Speaker 1>little house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so her dream said,</v>

1567
01:20:11.131 --> 01:20:11.964
<v Speaker 1>well the unknown had moved into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>backyard in the form of a tree and the </v>

1568
01:20:14.491 --> 01:20:15.324
<v Speaker 1>tree burned down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a tree is often a symbol of the </v>

1569
01:20:17.551 --> 01:20:18.384
<v Speaker 1>psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it left the hall and the hall was </v>

1570
01:20:19.261 --> 01:20:22.140
<v Speaker 1>full of water and then the little baby </v>
<v Speaker 1>went into the water,</v>

1571
01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:26.580
<v Speaker 1>dissolved and went into the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then this weird bug got him out.</v>

1572
01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:30.810
<v Speaker 1>So it was some alive thing bug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually,</v>

1573
01:20:30.811 --> 01:20:32.970
<v Speaker 1>it was a bug like Jimminy cricket in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio,</v>

1574
01:20:32.971 --> 01:20:33.804
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause that's a bug and it's a bug that </v>

1575
01:20:34.561 --> 01:20:37.170
<v Speaker 1>leads transformation by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1576
01:20:37.171 --> 01:20:38.004
<v Speaker 1>the bug got him out and then he was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>big boy and what she was dealing with </v>

1577
01:20:40.411 --> 01:20:42.420
<v Speaker 1>was the nature of radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation.</v>

1578
01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:43.433
<v Speaker 1>How one thing could turn into something </v>
<v Speaker 1>different and then reconstitute itself </v>

1579
01:20:47.431 --> 01:20:49.770
<v Speaker 1>as something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she did that on a symbolic level.</v>

1580
01:20:50.190 --> 01:20:55.020
<v Speaker 1>So what time is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three rats.</v>

1581
01:20:58.950 --> 01:21:00.900
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'll tell you this little story for</v>

1582
01:21:00.901 --> 01:21:01.734
<v Speaker 1>one minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had a five year old nephew and he </v>

1583
01:21:04.171 --> 01:21:05.004
<v Speaker 1>was having night terrors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'd wake up at night screaming and </v>

1584
01:21:07.261 --> 01:21:08.930
<v Speaker 1>having a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1585
01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:11.130
<v Speaker 1>there was some trouble in his family at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that point.</v>

1586
01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:13.350
<v Speaker 1>His parents ended up getting divorced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>

1587
01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:16.620
<v Speaker 1>he'd wake up screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he also was running around during</v>

1588
01:21:16.621 --> 01:21:19.650
<v Speaker 1>the day with a little night hat on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a plastic sword.</v>

1589
01:21:19.651 --> 01:21:21.390
<v Speaker 1>And so he goes like Joe night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1590
01:21:21.391 --> 01:21:22.620
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when he went to bed,</v>

1591
01:21:22.621 --> 01:21:25.830
<v Speaker 1>he had the little night hat by him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>also the sword.</v>

1592
01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:28.800
<v Speaker 1>And so one night when I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had one of these night terrors.</v>

1593
01:21:28.801 --> 01:21:31.020
<v Speaker 1>And so I will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was there that morning and I said,</v>

1594
01:21:31.021 --> 01:21:32.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you dream anything?</v>

1595
01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:37.520
<v Speaker 1>And this is what he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dwarf like beat creatures who came up to</v>

1596
01:21:37.711 --> 01:21:38.544
<v Speaker 1>his knees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had he was out in the field and they </v>

1597
01:21:39.751 --> 01:21:41.670
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so these little things about this big,</v>

1598
01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:42.653
<v Speaker 1>they had no arms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just had a big head that was beaky </v>

1599
01:21:44.670 --> 01:21:48.770
<v Speaker 1>a beak and they were jumping at him with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beak and like chomping him.</v>

1600
01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:49.613
<v Speaker 1>And on the top of their head they had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was all hairy and greasy and on the </v>

1601
01:21:53.311 --> 01:21:55.260
<v Speaker 1>top of their head they had a cross </v>
<v Speaker 1>shaved in it.</v>

1602
01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:57.990
<v Speaker 1>So it was like everybody shut up at that</v>
<v Speaker 1>breakfast,</v>

1603
01:21:57.991 --> 01:21:58.680
<v Speaker 1>I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1604
01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:00.420
<v Speaker 1>oh that's what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no one to wonder.</v>

1605
01:22:00.421 --> 01:22:01.254
<v Speaker 1>You're screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then so he is fighting away with </v>

1606
01:22:03.661 --> 01:22:05.070
<v Speaker 1>these things and they're jumping on </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1607
01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:09.540
<v Speaker 1>But the problem was he said he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a dragon in the background and</v>

1608
01:22:09.541 --> 01:22:10.374
<v Speaker 1>what was happening was the dragon was </v>
<v Speaker 1>breathing out fire all the time and the </v>

1609
01:22:12.811 --> 01:22:16.080
<v Speaker 1>fire and the smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're turning into these dwarfed,</v>

1610
01:22:16.230 --> 01:22:17.063
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little dwarf bird things that were </v>

1611
01:22:18.211 --> 01:22:19.770
<v Speaker 1>biting them and it's like perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1612
01:22:19.771 --> 01:22:24.771
<v Speaker 1>It's such a perfect representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't fight off any one problem cause</v>

1613
01:22:25.141 --> 01:22:25.974
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of pointless because there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something in the background generating </v>

1614
01:22:27.871 --> 01:22:29.220
<v Speaker 1>problems like mad.</v>

1615
01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:32.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like a hydro cut off one head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven more grow.</v>

1616
01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:35.640
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could you do about that?</v>

1617
01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:37.380
<v Speaker 1>Which is a leading question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1618
01:22:37.381 --> 01:22:39.390
<v Speaker 1>Because it implies that he could do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about that.</v>

1619
01:22:39.570 --> 01:22:40.403
<v Speaker 1>So then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would take my dad and we would go </v>

1620
01:22:43.441 --> 01:22:44.274
<v Speaker 1>after the dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I jumped on his head and poke his eyes </v>

1621
01:22:46.261 --> 01:22:50.400
<v Speaker 1>out with my sword and then I go down its</v>
<v Speaker 1>belly to where the fire comes out.</v>

1622
01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:54.030
<v Speaker 1>And I'd carve out a piece of the firebox</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'd make a shield out of it.</v>

1623
01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:56.490
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1624
01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:00.070
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1625
01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:01.980
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>

1626
01:23:01.981 --> 01:23:04.320
<v Speaker 1>and I know this is hard to believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's absolutely true.</v>

1627
01:23:04.410 --> 01:23:08.620
<v Speaker 1>He did not have any night terrors after </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was extra cool.</v>

1628
01:23:08.621 --> 01:23:11.320
<v Speaker 1>And it was the leading question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cause he's like victim,</v>

1629
01:23:11.321 --> 01:23:11.741
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1630
01:23:11.741 --> 01:23:15.040
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible bird headed biting things,</v>

1631
01:23:15.250 --> 01:23:16.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty good.</v>

1632
01:23:16.571 --> 01:23:17.404
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's what the world's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's something in the </v>

1633
01:23:19.301 --> 01:23:22.270
<v Speaker 1>background generating these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

1634
01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:26.950
<v Speaker 1>You go to the source of the trouble and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you find something that shields yourself</v>

1635
01:23:26.951 --> 01:23:29.890
<v Speaker 1>from it in the encounter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant.</v>

1636
01:23:30.130 --> 01:23:30.963
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
