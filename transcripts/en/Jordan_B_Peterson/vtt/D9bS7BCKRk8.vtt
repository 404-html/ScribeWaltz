00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.240
<v Speaker 1>About a month ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had my funding for my ongoing research</v>

2
00:00:04.241 --> 00:00:08.950
<v Speaker 1>projects refused by the federal </v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

3
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.560
<v Speaker 1>a social sciences and Humanities </v>
<v Speaker 1>Research Council,</v>

4
00:00:11.561 --> 00:00:12.394
<v Speaker 1>and as an event from rebel media decided</v>
<v Speaker 1>to host on Indiegogo crowdfunding </v>

5
00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:22.150
<v Speaker 1>campaign to replace it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was very good of him.</v>

6
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.463
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so thank you to Ezra and also to itn </v>

7
00:00:25.781 --> 00:00:30.060
<v Speaker 1>deal board who helped out a lot and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hannah Vander Coi for managing it.</v>

8
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:32.500
<v Speaker 1>It was extraordinarily helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.573
<v Speaker 1>we raised about $80,000 the first day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then since then we've raised about </v>

10
00:00:37.691 --> 00:00:40.180
<v Speaker 1>$180,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2,500 backers.</v>

11
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.400
<v Speaker 1>The original grant proposal was for </v>
<v Speaker 1>$300,000 across five years.</v>

12
00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:47.440
<v Speaker 1>So that's basically three years of </v>
<v Speaker 1>funding.</v>

13
00:00:47.441 --> 00:00:49.810
<v Speaker 1>So I'm extraordinarily impressed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

14
00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:53.590
<v Speaker 1>And also very thankful for all of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>who donated.</v>

15
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you very much.</v>

16
00:00:55.841 --> 00:00:56.674
<v Speaker 1>I've put together this video with two of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my graduate students whose academic </v>

17
00:01:00.311 --> 00:01:01.144
<v Speaker 1>careers will be supported as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of this funding so that you </v>

18
00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:05.314
<v Speaker 1>know a little bit more about them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>also about what it is that you helped </v>

19
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.740
<v Speaker 1>out with the third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christine Brophy is working on political</v>

20
00:01:14.051 --> 00:01:14.710
<v Speaker 1>correctness.</v>

21
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.780
<v Speaker 1>And the relationship between personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>and political belief as well as on the,</v>

22
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.050
<v Speaker 1>on the biological basis of the big five </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality traits.</v>

23
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.410
<v Speaker 1>She couldn't contribute to the video </v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

24
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:27.813
<v Speaker 1>for various reasons this time round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although she did a lengthy interview </v>

25
00:01:30.311 --> 00:01:32.810
<v Speaker 1>with ray rebel media that you can catch </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a,</v>

26
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.840
<v Speaker 1>on social justice issues and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and their basis in personality.</v>

27
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.070
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.993
<v Speaker 1>after this very brief introduction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to let the students speak for </v>

29
00:01:43.661 --> 00:01:44.494
<v Speaker 1>each for five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've prepared a video telling you </v>

30
00:01:46.061 --> 00:01:48.820
<v Speaker 1>what they're up to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

31
00:01:48.821 --> 00:01:49.654
<v Speaker 1>thanks very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have one day left of the funding </v>

32
00:01:51.371 --> 00:01:52.204
<v Speaker 1>campaign runs for 24 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the final update in all </v>

33
00:01:56.801 --> 00:01:58.280
<v Speaker 1>likelihood by March.</v>

34
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.790
<v Speaker 2>Hi everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My name's John Tenant.</v>

35
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm a first year master's student in Dr </v>
<v Speaker 2>Peterson's lab.</v>

36
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.590
<v Speaker 2>My research interests include technology</v>
<v Speaker 2>for cognitive enhancement,</v>

37
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.200
<v Speaker 2>personality development,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and music cognition.</v>

38
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.933
<v Speaker 2>My background is a little bit different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did my bachelor's degree in music </v>

39
00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:17.564
<v Speaker 2>theory and my undergraduate research </v>
<v Speaker 2>focused on mathematical models of </v>

40
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:21.703
<v Speaker 2>musical harmony and timber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This year I'll be designing and testing </v>

41
00:02:24.531 --> 00:02:27.830
<v Speaker 2>a biofeedback system for increasing </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's ability to flow,</v>

42
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.800
<v Speaker 2>self regulate and get in tune with one </v>
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

43
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm using a variety of sensors to </v>
<v Speaker 2>measure things like heart rate,</v>

44
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.040
<v Speaker 2>breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>arousal,</v>

45
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.323
<v Speaker 2>and brainwaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are we turning these signals into </v>

46
00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:41.174
<v Speaker 2>quads?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm musical stimuli to give people </v>

47
00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:44.750
<v Speaker 2>feedback about their body and mind in </v>
<v Speaker 2>real time.</v>

48
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.363
<v Speaker 2>They should be able to help people </v>
<v Speaker 2>better understand themselves and </v>

49
00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:51.380
<v Speaker 2>regulate their stress and emotions if </v>
<v Speaker 2>used in pairs,</v>

50
00:02:51.381 --> 00:02:53.780
<v Speaker 2>they might even be able to help people </v>
<v Speaker 2>sync up with one another,</v>

51
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.033
<v Speaker 2>perhaps fostering empathy and helping </v>
<v Speaker 2>them get into a kind of interpersonal </v>

52
00:02:58.311 --> 00:02:59.144
<v Speaker 2>flow state.</v>

53
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 2>I have a huge personal interest in </v>
<v Speaker 2>combining music,</v>

54
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.393
<v Speaker 2>psychology and technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In my undergraduate work with Dr </v>

55
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.770
<v Speaker 2>Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tackled theoretical issues surrounding</v>

56
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.700
<v Speaker 2>visual representations of music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While working on that project,</v>

57
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:13.534
<v Speaker 2>I developed a method for making </v>
<v Speaker 2>important musical parameters such as </v>

58
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 2>harmony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pitch,</v>

59
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.680
<v Speaker 2>rhythm and tamber accessible to our </v>
<v Speaker 2>visual system.</v>

60
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.323
<v Speaker 2>I created two software.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Music visualizer is based on these </v>

61
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:24.874
<v Speaker 2>principles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found these techniques also translate </v>

62
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:31.600
<v Speaker 2>well to other applications such as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>visualization of biological data.</v>

63
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.050
<v Speaker 2>If you'd like to see the music </v>
<v Speaker 2>visualizes,</v>

64
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:37.540
<v Speaker 2>I developed or read about the principles</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind them,</v>

65
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.900
<v Speaker 2>you can check out my </v>
<v Speaker 2>website@JohnMatthewtenant.com.</v>

66
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.770
<v Speaker 2>There you can also find my undergraduate</v>
<v Speaker 2>paper on math and musical harmony.</v>

67
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 2>In my personality research this year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked at female mate preference in an</v>

68
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:51.544
<v Speaker 2>online study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women read the profile of a fictional </v>

69
00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:54.244
<v Speaker 2>man and size picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women then rated the man's </v>

70
00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 2>attractiveness and personality.</v>

71
00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.163
<v Speaker 2>They also answered questions about their</v>
<v Speaker 2>own personality and completed an Iq </v>

72
00:04:01.721 --> 00:04:03.910
<v Speaker 2>test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From this data,</v>

73
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:07.270
<v Speaker 2>we were able to build a model of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of personalities are attractive to</v>

74
00:04:07.271 --> 00:04:08.920
<v Speaker 2>who.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On average,</v>

75
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.500
<v Speaker 2>women tended to prefer men who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientious,</v>

76
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.420
<v Speaker 2>extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>agreeable,</v>

77
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.583
<v Speaker 2>emotionally stable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and open to experience higher Iq </v>

78
00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:19.570
<v Speaker 2>participants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

79
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.790
<v Speaker 2>where the men is much less attractive on</v>
<v Speaker 2>average,</v>

80
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.720
<v Speaker 2>and they were less moved by those </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditionally attractive characteristics</v>

81
00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:28.000
<v Speaker 2>like extroversion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness,</v>

82
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.300
<v Speaker 2>emotional stability for more intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

83
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:32.583
<v Speaker 2>The only things that made a significant </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference where creativity and </v>

84
00:04:34.451 --> 00:04:35.284
<v Speaker 2>plaintiffs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are sub aspects of openness and </v>

85
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:37.834
<v Speaker 2>agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we think creativity might be especially </v>

86
00:04:40.391 --> 00:04:44.440
<v Speaker 2>attractive because it indicates </v>
<v Speaker 2>competence in unfamiliar situations.</v>

87
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.263
<v Speaker 2>The attraction to agreeableness might be</v>
<v Speaker 2>due to a desire for a partner who will </v>

88
00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:49.804
<v Speaker 2>share resources and care for children</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my upcoming personality research and </v>

89
00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:55.894
<v Speaker 2>developing a new method for </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigating the structure of </v>

90
00:04:57.451 --> 00:04:58.284
<v Speaker 2>personality.</v>

91
00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.853
<v Speaker 2>In traditional personality studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>participants rate themselves on every </v>

92
00:05:02.351 --> 00:05:04.990
<v Speaker 2>item.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This limits the number of items that can</v>

93
00:05:04.991 --> 00:05:07.780
<v Speaker 2>be analyzed simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>

94
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.883
<v Speaker 2>we're going to use collaborative ratings</v>
<v Speaker 2>of fictional characters and public </v>

95
00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:12.244
<v Speaker 2>figures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Multiple people will provide ratings of </v>

96
00:05:14.441 --> 00:05:15.274
<v Speaker 2>the targets personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we can build up a complete </v>

97
00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:18.034
<v Speaker 2>description from the multiple raters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This will allow us to investigate the </v>

98
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:25.000
<v Speaker 2>personality data contained inside larger</v>
<v Speaker 2>sets of descriptors.</v>

99
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.753
<v Speaker 2>This will help us rapidly expand the </v>
<v Speaker 2>vocabulary of words we can use to </v>

100
00:05:29.231 --> 00:05:30.064
<v Speaker 2>measure personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which should increase the precision of </v>

101
00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:32.464
<v Speaker 2>our models.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first study to use this method will </v>

102
00:05:34.421 --> 00:05:35.254
<v Speaker 2>attempt to integrate positive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative person descriptors with our </v>

103
00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:38.734
<v Speaker 2>existing personality models.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is important because when the </v>

104
00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:44.700
<v Speaker 2>original scales were devised,</v>
<v Speaker 2>researchers purposely omitted words like</v>

105
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.010
<v Speaker 2>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>untrustworthy wise and admirable,</v>

106
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.043
<v Speaker 2>but adding these words to our models of </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality will be able to further </v>

107
00:05:52.661 --> 00:05:55.900
<v Speaker 2>explore the virtues and vices associated</v>
<v Speaker 2>with personality dimensions.</v>

108
00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.750
<v Speaker 2>We might also be able to pick up on new </v>
<v Speaker 2>effects and correlations.</v>

109
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.330
<v Speaker 2>This can be especially useful in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>labs,</v>

110
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:05.540
<v Speaker 2>ongoing research into the personality </v>
<v Speaker 2>underpinnings of political belief,</v>

111
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.810
<v Speaker 2>so I'd like to thank everyone for </v>
<v Speaker 2>supporting our research.</v>

112
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.410
<v Speaker 2>It makes a really big difference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially to us the graduate students.</v>

113
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.560
<v Speaker 2>If you're interest in any of my work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to hear from you.</v>

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.203
<v Speaker 3>primarily researching how mental health </v>
<v Speaker 3>is shaped by the ways in which people </v>

119
00:06:35.421 --> 00:06:37.700
<v Speaker 3>relate to their own descriptions of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

120
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:39.643
<v Speaker 3>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my overall research investigates the </v>

121
00:06:41.091 --> 00:06:43.460
<v Speaker 3>nature of the big five personality </v>
<v Speaker 3>traits.</v>

122
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.390
<v Speaker 3>The big five represent distinct patterns</v>
<v Speaker 3>of feeling,</v>

123
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.080
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and acting that are shared by all of us.</v>

124
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.960
<v Speaker 3>Humans and higher primates seem to </v>
<v Speaker 3>possess five distinct dispositions,</v>

125
00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.153
<v Speaker 3>hence the name openness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a tendency to seek novel ideas and </v>

126
00:07:02.151 --> 00:07:02.984
<v Speaker 3>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Neuroticism tendency to seek certainty </v>

127
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.620
<v Speaker 3>and experience negative emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extroversion,</v>

128
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.730
<v Speaker 3>a tendency to seek attention and </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience positive emotions,</v>

129
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.313
<v Speaker 3>agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a tendency to seek social harmony </v>

130
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.840
<v Speaker 3>through politeness and compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and finally,</v>

131
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:25.760
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness is a tendency to </v>
<v Speaker 3>adhere to standards and goals by working</v>

132
00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:26.594
<v Speaker 3>hard and staying organized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This final trade has been the focus of </v>

133
00:07:30.321 --> 00:07:33.230
<v Speaker 3>my research for reasons that I will </v>
<v Speaker 3>explain shortly.</v>

134
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:35.773
<v Speaker 3>Every person has these five traits to </v>
<v Speaker 3>some degree and these traits remained </v>

135
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.890
<v Speaker 3>relatively stable throughout adulthood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As such,</v>

136
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.053
<v Speaker 3>the big five traits are important to </v>
<v Speaker 3>both industry and academia because they </v>

137
00:07:48.441 --> 00:07:52.010
<v Speaker 3>can be used to reliably capture who a </v>
<v Speaker 3>person is.</v>

138
00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.970
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are confident that the big five model</v>

139
00:07:55.971 --> 00:07:56.804
<v Speaker 3>represents a real and meaningful </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological construct because it has </v>

140
00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:03.980
<v Speaker 3>been arrived at through several </v>
<v Speaker 3>independent methodologies.</v>

141
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:05.683
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do not yet know why human </v>

142
00:08:07.341 --> 00:08:09.950
<v Speaker 3>dispositions cluster into these five </v>
<v Speaker 3>traits,</v>

143
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:15.560
<v Speaker 3>nor do we know how to ascertain big five</v>
<v Speaker 3>traits without directly asking people to</v>

144
00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:19.280
<v Speaker 3>introspect about themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is where my research comes in.</v>

145
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.530
<v Speaker 3>For the past three years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been investigating how the big five</v>

146
00:08:24.531 --> 00:08:27.590
<v Speaker 3>traits can be detected without self </v>
<v Speaker 3>report.</v>

147
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:29.503
<v Speaker 3>This effort has taken many forms which I</v>
<v Speaker 3>will continue to pursue throughout the </v>

148
00:08:32.991 --> 00:08:35.480
<v Speaker 3>course of my phd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For instance,</v>

149
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.823
<v Speaker 3>I've been investigating whether the big </v>
<v Speaker 3>five traits map onto differences in </v>

150
00:08:40.761 --> 00:08:45.350
<v Speaker 3>fundamental cognitive processes such as </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention thus far.</v>

151
00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:46.693
<v Speaker 3>I have found support for the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientious people are remarkably </v>

152
00:08:49.491 --> 00:08:54.200
<v Speaker 3>better at deliberately attending to </v>
<v Speaker 3>specific features under distractions.</v>

153
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.093
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who score high on openness are </v>

154
00:08:57.961 --> 00:09:01.920
<v Speaker 3>notably flexible at attending to </v>
<v Speaker 3>changing attentional demands.</v>

155
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:04.403
<v Speaker 3>This research suggests that the big five</v>
<v Speaker 3>traits may have a basis in fundamental </v>

156
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.173
<v Speaker 3>cognitive processes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this may lead to the development of </v>

157
00:09:12.331 --> 00:09:13.164
<v Speaker 3>personality screening measures that have</v>
<v Speaker 3>a basis in part on cognitive </v>

158
00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:21.480
<v Speaker 3>performance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've also been investigating whether the</v>

159
00:09:21.481 --> 00:09:22.314
<v Speaker 3>big five traits reveal themselves in </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivational reactions to positive and </v>

160
00:09:26.281 --> 00:09:30.570
<v Speaker 3>negative feedback on a variety of tasks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So far,</v>

161
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.640
<v Speaker 3>this line of research has revealed that </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientious and neurotic people can be</v>

162
00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:39.180
<v Speaker 3>provoked to work harder by using </v>
<v Speaker 3>negative feedback.</v>

163
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:40.733
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this effect only emerges when the task </v>

164
00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:46.080
<v Speaker 3>is somewhat enjoyable and the effect is </v>
<v Speaker 3>first.</v>

165
00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.073
<v Speaker 3>If the task is frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This line of research suggests that the </v>

166
00:09:50.971 --> 00:09:55.470
<v Speaker 3>big five may have a basis in more </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamental motivational tendencies,</v>

167
00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:56.843
<v Speaker 3>and this may lead to the development of </v>
<v Speaker 3>a motivational intervention that's </v>

168
00:09:59.821 --> 00:10:02.460
<v Speaker 3>tailored to specific personality </v>
<v Speaker 3>profiles.</v>

169
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.770
<v Speaker 3>What am I most promising?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Research projects concerns the detection</v>

170
00:10:07.771 --> 00:10:08.604
<v Speaker 3>of personality through language use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This research is founded on the </v>

171
00:10:12.001 --> 00:10:12.834
<v Speaker 3>presupposition that character can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>revealed through the words that </v>

172
00:10:15.511 --> 00:10:16.344
<v Speaker 3>individuals tend to use this ideas </v>
<v Speaker 3>intuitive when we think about simple </v>

173
00:10:21.571 --> 00:10:24.060
<v Speaker 3>dispositions such as pessimism and </v>
<v Speaker 3>optimism.</v>

174
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:25.733
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would expect an optimist to use a </v>

175
00:10:28.021 --> 00:10:30.480
<v Speaker 3>disproportionate amount of positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>words.</v>

176
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.153
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was unclear as to whether this would </v>

177
00:10:33.871 --> 00:10:37.710
<v Speaker 3>extend to complex dispositions such as </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness,</v>

178
00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:42.300
<v Speaker 3>which again represents a tendency to </v>
<v Speaker 3>work hard and stay organized.</v>

179
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.980
<v Speaker 3>This disposition does not clearly map </v>
<v Speaker 3>onto word choice,</v>

180
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:48.323
<v Speaker 3>so to test our hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we generated a list of more than a </v>

181
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:53.063
<v Speaker 3>thousand adjectives that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>theoretically relevant to conscientious </v>

182
00:10:54.751 --> 00:10:55.584
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These words included things such as </v>

183
00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.790
<v Speaker 3>methodical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>persistent,</v>

184
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:01.043
<v Speaker 3>and resourceful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We then acquired a variety of writing </v>

185
00:11:04.261 --> 00:11:05.094
<v Speaker 3>samples from different groups of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These writing samples included </v>

186
00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:11.340
<v Speaker 3>recollections of positive memories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>negative memories,</v>

187
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.790
<v Speaker 3>ordinary experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as well as stream of thought essays.</v>

188
00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:19.200
<v Speaker 3>And even facebook statuses across all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>these samples,</v>

189
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:20.423
<v Speaker 3>we found highly conscientious people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>use a disproportionate amount of </v>

190
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:27.180
<v Speaker 3>conscientious related adjectives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>

191
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:31.560
<v Speaker 3>but we also found that the use of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>adjectives predicts the same outcomes as</v>

192
00:11:31.561 --> 00:11:35.790
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including increased income and increased</v>

193
00:11:35.791 --> 00:11:36.624
<v Speaker 3>passion for work that we have </v>
<v Speaker 3>demonstrated that it is possible to </v>

194
00:11:40.681 --> 00:11:41.514
<v Speaker 3>identify complex personality traits from</v>
<v Speaker 3>many different language samples easily </v>

195
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:46.703
<v Speaker 3>and reliably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We started with conscientiousness loan </v>

196
00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:51.870
<v Speaker 3>because of its clear real world </v>
<v Speaker 3>applications.</v>

197
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.943
<v Speaker 3>Many of our most valued social,</v>
<v Speaker 3>organizational and individual outcomes </v>

198
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:01.990
<v Speaker 3>are determined by conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People who possess this trait enrich our</v>

199
00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:06.010
<v Speaker 3>communities by exercising social </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility and relational fidelity.</v>

200
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:07.563
<v Speaker 3>As top performers at work in school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientious people drive up the </v>

201
00:12:10.151 --> 00:12:13.420
<v Speaker 3>productivity of our organizations and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the grades in our classrooms.</v>

202
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.340
<v Speaker 3>By demonstrating that conscientiousness </v>
<v Speaker 3>can be detected through natural language</v>

203
00:12:18.341 --> 00:12:19.174
<v Speaker 3>use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have opened the door to a new </v>

204
00:12:20.381 --> 00:12:23.830
<v Speaker 3>approach for detecting a highly </v>
<v Speaker 3>desirable personality traits.</v>

205
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:29.790
<v Speaker 3>The trait that many people lie about </v>
<v Speaker 3>precisely due to its societal value.</v>

206
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.433
<v Speaker 3>Am I coming years in the Peterson lab?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I plan to develop a personality </v>

207
00:12:35.501 --> 00:12:38.710
<v Speaker 3>measurement battery based on these </v>
<v Speaker 3>natural language findings.</v>

208
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:40.503
<v Speaker 3>The development of this battery will </v>
<v Speaker 3>require more research into the language </v>

209
00:12:43.181 --> 00:12:46.060
<v Speaker 3>production tendencies associated with </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness,</v>

210
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:47.343
<v Speaker 3>as well as an extension of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>methodology to other big five </v>

211
00:12:49.691 --> 00:12:50.524
<v Speaker 3>personality traits taken together with </v>
<v Speaker 3>my research and attention and </v>

212
00:12:53.921 --> 00:12:54.754
<v Speaker 3>motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This work will help solidify what the </v>

213
00:12:57.161 --> 00:12:57.994
<v Speaker 3>big five represents and will afford the </v>
<v Speaker 3>development of new tools for measuring </v>

214
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:03.790
<v Speaker 3>and accommodating personality.</v>
