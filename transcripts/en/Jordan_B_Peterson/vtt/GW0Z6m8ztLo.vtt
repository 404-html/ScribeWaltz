00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.893
<v Speaker 1>The problem with wanting to be friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your child is that that's not good </v>

2
00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:07.020
<v Speaker 1>enough because as a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not less than a friend.</v>

3
00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:10.410
<v Speaker 1>You're far more than a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're someone that's going to be in the</v>

4
00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:12.660
<v Speaker 1>child's life for the duration of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

5
00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:17.430
<v Speaker 1>With any luck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a longterm island of stability in</v>

6
00:00:17.431 --> 00:00:18.264
<v Speaker 1>a sea of turbulence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the child needs that far more than </v>

7
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.063
<v Speaker 1>than he or she needs a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parents need to be courageous because </v>

8
00:00:27.211 --> 00:00:29.520
<v Speaker 1>they have to let their children go and </v>
<v Speaker 1>make mistakes.</v>

9
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.130
<v Speaker 1>You have to let your child fall when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're learning to walk.</v>

10
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 1>They bump themselves up against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world a lot,</v>

11
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.600
<v Speaker 1>and you don't want to do any more for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your child than you absolutely have to,</v>

12
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.200
<v Speaker 1>and it means that there's a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of detached harshness that has to</v>

13
00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:44.990
<v Speaker 1>go along with your love and compassion.</v>

14
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.590
<v Speaker 1>You have to stand back and let your </v>
<v Speaker 1>child stumble forward towards mastery.</v>

15
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.633
<v Speaker 1>Today's parents are terrified of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>children because they're often afraid </v>

16
00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:54.354
<v Speaker 1>that if they intervene in their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they'll make a mistake and that </v>

17
00:00:56.791 --> 00:01:01.320
<v Speaker 1>that will be irrevocable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to have the courage of your</v>

18
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:02.154
<v Speaker 1>convictions when you have children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to understand that if you </v>

19
00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:05.094
<v Speaker 1>do make mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can learn and you can be </v>

20
00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>forgiven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to be a perfect parent,</v>

21
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.540
<v Speaker 1>although you should aim up with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

22
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Parents are terrified of making </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakes,</v>

23
00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:18.360
<v Speaker 1>and that means that they're terrified of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being parents and they,</v>

24
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.190
<v Speaker 1>and that stops them from being parents.</v>
