1
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Undoubtedly you've noticed that this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>being taped so the tapes will show up on</v>

2
00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:08.490
<v Speaker 1>some relatively regular schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.890
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't expect that precisely because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to make any promises about,</v>

4
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.440
<v Speaker 1>you know exactly how quickly that'll be </v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

5
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Martin Jang here is doing it on his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>accord so it's like,</v>

6
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.403
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two thumbs up for Martin as far as I'm </v>

7
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:23.274
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because he's done this for a number </v>

8
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:28.140
<v Speaker 1>of my courses and it's a lot of work and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's much appreciated.</v>

9
00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:31.110
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why all of this stuff is set up.</v>

10
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.333
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

11
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.240
<v Speaker 1>I think I told you pretty much about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the class entails on your part,</v>

12
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.913
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

13
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.583
<v Speaker 1>and if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've heard this lecture and I'm sure </v>

14
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.600
<v Speaker 1>at least a reasonable number of you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard me lecture before,</v>

15
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:49.434
<v Speaker 1>so you sort of know how I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture and that was more or less how </v>

16
00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:53.064
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do it.</v>

17
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

18
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.540
<v Speaker 1>we can make this class like deadly </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>

20
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:01.374
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that you'll regard it as something </v>

21
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:03.961
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:04.794
<v Speaker 1>depending on your participation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously you'll regard it as something </v>

23
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:09.360
<v Speaker 1>that's really valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell any of the stuff I've learned</v>

24
00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:10.194
<v Speaker 1>that I'm telling you about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has been so useful to me that I </v>

25
00:01:12.811 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 1>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.823
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't really even communicate how </v>

27
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:20.910
<v Speaker 1>useful it's been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been unbelievably useful.</v>

28
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.223
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly what I'm going to explain to you </v>

29
00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:25.320
<v Speaker 1>if I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is why,</v>

30
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.333
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are tenants of classical morality </v>

31
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.320
<v Speaker 1>and there's a variety of them and one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them is,</v>

32
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:32.760
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't lie.</v>

33
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.953
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a tough one because you might </v>

34
00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:35.681
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

35
00:01:35.681 --> 00:01:37.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not really?</v>

36
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.490
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

37
00:01:38.491 --> 00:01:39.320
<v Speaker 1>if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

38
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.560
<v Speaker 1>if you can set up a situation so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you benefit from a,</v>

39
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.070
<v Speaker 1>from an untruth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what stops you from doing it,</v>

40
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.083
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Dostoevsky and one of his most </v>

41
00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:52.080
<v Speaker 1>famous statements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

42
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.840
<v Speaker 1>if there's no god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is permitted.</v>

43
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.660
<v Speaker 1>And it's a takeoff on Nietzsche and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking too,</v>

44
00:01:57.661 --> 00:01:58.494
<v Speaker 1>and it's a problem that he thought would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be the fundamental problem of the 20th </v>

45
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:01.704
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think he was absolutely right and </v>

46
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.010
<v Speaker 1>it's a question very much we're thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

47
00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:07.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why bother with things that are moral?</v>

48
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:08.694
<v Speaker 1>Why do things right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there even such a thing as doing </v>

49
00:02:10.381 --> 00:02:13.080
<v Speaker 1>things right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are great questions.</v>

50
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.333
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hopefully I'm going to try to do </v>

51
00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:20.420
<v Speaker 1>with you guys is to show you what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

52
00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:21.870
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking about those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

53
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost 30 years I guess now.</v>

54
00:02:24.391 --> 00:02:26.160
<v Speaker 1>And I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.053
<v Speaker 1>I've got a ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly a ways that has been </v>

56
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.533
<v Speaker 1>satisfying to me and I want to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I've concluded and then you can </v>

57
00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:35.790
<v Speaker 1>decide for yourself if you think it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful.</v>

58
00:02:35.791 --> 00:02:40.791
<v Speaker 1>And one thing I would really encourage </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to do is like,</v>

59
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.043
<v Speaker 1>you should be skeptical about what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling you really like you should </v>

60
00:02:46.741 --> 00:02:47.510
<v Speaker 1>question it.</v>

61
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.343
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean the kind of skepticism </v>

62
00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:51.630
<v Speaker 1>that's like this because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:02:51.631 --> 00:02:52.464
<v Speaker 1>I'm not here to prove myself to you at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all and you're not here to prove </v>

64
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:57.590
<v Speaker 1>yourself to me either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to listen,</v>

65
00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.800
<v Speaker 1>you have to attend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by same token,</v>

66
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:04.060
<v Speaker 1>I would say like I'm telling you things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I have tried to hammer to death,</v>

67
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to see if they were wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>because that's how you're supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>test ideas.</v>

69
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:10.030
<v Speaker 1>You throw out an idea and you have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hammer,</v>

70
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:12.700
<v Speaker 1>the hell out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if you can see if it's wrong,</v>

71
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.973
<v Speaker 1>not whether it's right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's an ideological thinking </v>

72
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 1>and the things I'm telling you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>things I could not disprove.</v>

73
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>They seem to stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've tried multiple tests,</v>

74
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:23.584
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one of them is sort of a consilience </v>

75
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:26.224
<v Speaker 1>test and the consumer says a word that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was defined by Edward or Wilson and </v>

76
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:30.700
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when an,</v>

77
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.533
<v Speaker 1>when an explanation is consilience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that means is that it's coherent </v>

78
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:37.290
<v Speaker 1>across multiple levels of analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

79
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.930
<v Speaker 1>And so I've tried to test the ideas that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm describing to you.</v>

80
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:42.693
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to determine whether they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>logically coherent and appropriate at </v>

81
00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:53.701
<v Speaker 1>the level of general psychology and </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical psychology and neuroscience and</v>

82
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.840
<v Speaker 1>narrative theory and religious thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then also to see if they're actually</v>

83
00:03:58.841 --> 00:04:03.841
<v Speaker 1>applicable as practical as practical </v>
<v Speaker 1>realities in day to day life.</v>

84
00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:07.420
<v Speaker 1>And an end in social life and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

85
00:04:07.421 --> 00:04:08.254
<v Speaker 1>they stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's been my experience and I've also </v>

86
00:04:10.301 --> 00:04:14.920
<v Speaker 1>watched people over many years now try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to apply them in their own lives and all</v>

87
00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:18.670
<v Speaker 1>I've been able to see so far with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>graduate students and so on is that they</v>

88
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.710
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

89
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.753
<v Speaker 1>ray for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're going to try to understand </v>

90
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.850
<v Speaker 1>some basic issues like what the utility </v>
<v Speaker 1>of truth is.</v>

91
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:29.403
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really important question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's maybe the fundamental question is </v>

92
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:33.970
<v Speaker 1>truth useful?</v>

93
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.100
<v Speaker 1>And if so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how and why?</v>

94
00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:38.050
<v Speaker 1>And like man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go after that.</v>

95
00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:38.884
<v Speaker 1>Especially with regards to verbal truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's something magical about </v>

96
00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:42.994
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There really is something magical about </v>

97
00:04:44.681 --> 00:04:47.140
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way you use words determines the</v>

98
00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:47.974
<v Speaker 1>course of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe more than that maybe the </v>

99
00:04:49.451 --> 00:04:50.284
<v Speaker 1>course of everyone's life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to explain to you how that </v>

100
00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:55.240
<v Speaker 1>can be true and what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

101
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.900
<v Speaker 1>that should be relatively entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And hopefully,</v>

102
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.110
<v Speaker 1>what else I can tell you is I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw out some key propositions.</v>

103
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:05.074
<v Speaker 1>There's probably about seven or eight of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and what I'm hoping is that you'll </v>

104
00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:08.314
<v Speaker 1>be able to use those propositions as </v>
<v Speaker 1>keys that will help you unlock things </v>

105
00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:13.960
<v Speaker 1>that you wouldn't otherwise be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciously understand.</v>

106
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.320
<v Speaker 1>And I gave you some example of that with</v>
<v Speaker 1>this little story,</v>

107
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.183
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that little story happens to be </v>

108
00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:22.060
<v Speaker 1>an extraordinarily deep little story and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

109
00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:22.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

110
00:05:22.501 --> 00:05:25.570
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so old that story like I think that</v>

111
00:05:25.571 --> 00:05:28.630
<v Speaker 1>story stems from when we were still in </v>
<v Speaker 1>trees really.</v>

112
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.240
<v Speaker 1>And that our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when our prime enemies were snakes,</v>

113
00:05:31.241 --> 00:05:33.730
<v Speaker 1>because it does appear according to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lynne Isbell anyways,</v>

114
00:05:33.731 --> 00:05:37.600
<v Speaker 1>who's an anthropologist and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>California and that,</v>

115
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our primary predators,</v>

116
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:42.610
<v Speaker 1>60 million years ago when we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically inhabiting trees,</v>

117
00:05:42.611 --> 00:05:44.950
<v Speaker 1>were predatory snakes and that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved with.</v>

118
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.873
<v Speaker 1>And so they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human being versus snake Motif is not </v>

119
00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:53.950
<v Speaker 1>only the oldest story we know from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciously articulated perspective,</v>

120
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:58.951
<v Speaker 1>but it might be the literal story of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>species as a biological entity.</v>

121
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:04.190
<v Speaker 1>So know that I'm telling you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it gives you some idea about how</v>

122
00:06:04.191 --> 00:06:05.024
<v Speaker 1>deep these stories can go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can go to the really to the bottom </v>

123
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:12.530
<v Speaker 1>of things and if you know some of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>key propositions,</v>

124
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.060
<v Speaker 1>when you see archetipal stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>portrayed in front of you with,</v>

125
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.953
<v Speaker 1>and that happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I been all the superhero movies that </v>

126
00:06:20.811 --> 00:06:23.030
<v Speaker 1>have come out later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>later lately.</v>

127
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.043
<v Speaker 1>Nursing Home hoards of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are tremendously expensive to make </v>

128
00:06:26.361 --> 00:06:28.370
<v Speaker 1>a hundreds of millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things.</v>

129
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're all predicated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetipal themes,</v>

130
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:32.773
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's of great interest to </v>

131
00:06:33.681 --> 00:06:34.514
<v Speaker 1>know the most expensive artifacts that </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings produced or at least among </v>

132
00:06:37.431 --> 00:06:38.264
<v Speaker 1>the most expensive artifacts that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce are precisely movies that are </v>

133
00:06:42.141 --> 00:06:44.510
<v Speaker 1>computer generated to tell archetipal </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>

134
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.310
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's also the,</v>

135
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.473
<v Speaker 1>the technological process that in large </v>
<v Speaker 1>part is driving computer innovation </v>

136
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:52.694
<v Speaker 1>because the most demand that's being </v>
<v Speaker 1>placed on things like computer chips is </v>

137
00:06:55.671 --> 00:06:56.504
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

138
00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:57.533
<v Speaker 1>recreating reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>CGI reality because it's the most </v>

139
00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 1>complicated thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

140
00:07:02.061 --> 00:07:03.440
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are we doing that?</v>

141
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.260
<v Speaker 1>What's up with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you spend $300,</v>

142
00:07:06.261 --> 00:07:08.540
<v Speaker 1>million dollars making iron man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

143
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.540
<v Speaker 1>there's a profit motive there obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everybody will go see it.</v>

144
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:12.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's up with you people?</v>

145
00:07:12.801 --> 00:07:13.634
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to see some Dingbat and a </v>

146
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.090
<v Speaker 1>metal suit fly around in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

147
00:07:17.091 --> 00:07:18.430
<v Speaker 1>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

148
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.950
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing at those movies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think while I'm entertaining myself.</v>

149
00:07:21.951 --> 00:07:22.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

150
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.720
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

151
00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Except why is it entertaining</v>

152
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.340
<v Speaker 1>and why is it entertaining to all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

153
00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.340
<v Speaker 1>Why is it entertaining to everyone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

154
00:07:31.341 --> 00:07:32.174
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So partly what we're going to find out </v>

155
00:07:34.101 --> 00:07:34.934
<v Speaker 1>too is what it is about stories that </v>
<v Speaker 1>attract our interest in why it is why </v>

156
00:07:38.451 --> 00:07:39.284
<v Speaker 1>that is and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not merely entertainment and it's </v>

157
00:07:42.201 --> 00:07:44.690
<v Speaker 1>like the most potent form of learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have.</v>

158
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.800
<v Speaker 1>So well anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's the goal.</v>

159
00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:50.180
<v Speaker 1>And during this as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

160
00:07:50.181 --> 00:07:54.650
<v Speaker 1>I hope that you can articulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourselves further and also come to some</v>

161
00:07:54.651 --> 00:07:55.484
<v Speaker 1>deeper understanding about the absolute </v>
<v Speaker 1>essential nature of proper language use </v>

162
00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:03.500
<v Speaker 1>in spoken language and in written </v>
<v Speaker 1>language because you bake,</v>

163
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:07.910
<v Speaker 1>you basically think and speak and write </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself into existence.</v>

164
00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:10.550
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that means is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be very,</v>

165
00:08:10.551 --> 00:08:11.384
<v Speaker 1>very careful with what you say because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are literally bringing realms of </v>

166
00:08:15.891 --> 00:08:16.724
<v Speaker 1>reality into being through speaking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to make bloody sure that the </v>

167
00:08:19.191 --> 00:08:22.700
<v Speaker 1>realms of reality that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>participating in bringing into being are</v>

168
00:08:22.701 --> 00:08:26.600
<v Speaker 1>the ones that you would actually like </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and those you love to inhabit.</v>

169
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.480
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

170
00:08:29.481 --> 00:08:34.481
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I don't have much more to say about</v>

171
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.133
<v Speaker 1>the course than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I'll do now is see if you have </v>

172
00:08:37.881 --> 00:08:40.610
<v Speaker 1>any questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>

173
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:44.613
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I liked them all along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like he was getting out of </v>

174
00:08:49.011 --> 00:08:53.720
<v Speaker 2>control but that he just wanted some </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention,</v>

175
00:08:53.721 --> 00:08:54.554
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know why from the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the building and was dragging that </v>

176
00:08:58.740 --> 00:08:59.220
<v Speaker 2>he's bad.</v>

177
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.053
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

178
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.303
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the question is why is the dragon </v>

179
00:09:03.541 --> 00:09:04.890
<v Speaker 1>portrayed as bad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

180
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:06.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

181
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.390
<v Speaker 1>we might notice that culture cross </v>
<v Speaker 1>culturally.</v>

182
00:09:09.391 --> 00:09:11.160
<v Speaker 1>That's not necessarily the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

183
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:11.994
<v Speaker 1>so the dragon in the West tends to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to conquer and something that </v>

184
00:09:16.441 --> 00:09:17.274
<v Speaker 1>hoards</v>

185
00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:22.190
<v Speaker 3>emergence strangely enough and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>something to be conquered and the church</v>

186
00:09:22.191 --> 00:09:24.350
<v Speaker 3>are to be taken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in east,</v>

187
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:25.243
<v Speaker 3>particularly among the Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dragon is something that's positive </v>

188
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.720
<v Speaker 3>and what I would say is when we'll study</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

189
00:09:29.721 --> 00:09:33.110
<v Speaker 3>when we get into the symbolism that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with with reptiles,</v>

190
00:09:33.111 --> 00:09:36.500
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally with predatory reptiles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll see that the dragon is actually a</v>

191
00:09:36.501 --> 00:09:40.400
<v Speaker 3>tremendously ambivalent representation </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it represents.</v>

192
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.870
<v Speaker 3>It really represents the unknown or even</v>
<v Speaker 3>more precisely,</v>

193
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:49.610
<v Speaker 3>it represents the element of the unknown</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you don't even know exists.</v>

194
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:53.180
<v Speaker 3>You don't because sometimes something </v>
<v Speaker 3>unexpected could happen to you,</v>

195
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:55.550
<v Speaker 3>but you can understand it when it </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens,</v>

196
00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:57.583
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes something unexpected </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens to you when it's so unexpected </v>

197
00:09:59.781 --> 00:10:02.600
<v Speaker 3>that you can't even conceptualize it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say when the.</v>

198
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:05.510
<v Speaker 3>When the twin towers fell in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was an event like that,</v>

199
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:09.680
<v Speaker 3>it's really outside the domain of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding and then there's a.</v>

200
00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.910
<v Speaker 3>there's an ambivalence about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you don't know the nature of the</v>

201
00:10:13.911 --> 00:10:17.610
<v Speaker 3>event precisely so the the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

202
00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.780
<v Speaker 3>the predatory reptiles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially the treasure garden,</v>

203
00:10:20.781 --> 00:10:24.830
<v Speaker 3>predatory reptiles stands for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>potential that exists in the unknown,</v>

204
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.860
<v Speaker 3>and that potential can be positive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>negative,</v>

205
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:28.963
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's the source of all new </v>

206
00:10:30.231 --> 00:10:31.064
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also the source of that which will </v>

207
00:10:32.871 --> 00:10:36.050
<v Speaker 3>destroy them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it's a very paradoxical entity.</v>

208
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:37.520
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one more thing,</v>

209
00:10:37.521 --> 00:10:38.354
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the story implies that there's an </v>

210
00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:44.870
<v Speaker 3>optimal size of dragon and I would say </v>
<v Speaker 3>while you're nervous,</v>

211
00:10:44.871 --> 00:10:48.440
<v Speaker 3>systems are actually tuned to detect the</v>
<v Speaker 3>optimal size of dragons.</v>

212
00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:49.453
<v Speaker 3>What we'll talk about this in great </v>
<v Speaker 3>detail as we go through the biology of </v>

213
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:53.743
<v Speaker 3>anxiety and discussed as it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is something I've learned more </v>

214
00:10:56.331 --> 00:11:01.331
<v Speaker 3>about recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know how you can sometimes if you're</v>

215
00:11:02.001 --> 00:11:05.000
<v Speaker 3>engaged in a task,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say a cognitive task,</v>

216
00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.290
<v Speaker 3>you can find it overwhelming.</v>

217
00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:07.663
<v Speaker 3>It's right something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're having a very difficult time </v>

218
00:11:08.961 --> 00:11:11.060
<v Speaker 3>understanding and maybe you even wonder </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're up to it.</v>

219
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:12.500
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you might say,</v>

220
00:11:12.501 --> 00:11:14.540
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your nervous system is indicating to you</v>

221
00:11:14.541 --> 00:11:17.510
<v Speaker 3>that that's a threat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then other times you'll be dealing,</v>

222
00:11:17.511 --> 00:11:18.344
<v Speaker 3>say with the cognitive task,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's beneath your abilities and so it's </v>

223
00:11:21.081 --> 00:11:21.914
<v Speaker 3>easy and you get bored,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then you'll be dealing with a </v>

224
00:11:25.611 --> 00:11:28.970
<v Speaker 3>cognitive task that it's like goldilocks</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the three bears,</v>

225
00:11:28.971 --> 00:11:29.804
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The temperature is just right and what </v>

226
00:11:31.311 --> 00:11:32.144
<v Speaker 3>happens is that you have to grapple with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the task and it pushes you forward into </v>

227
00:11:35.741 --> 00:11:39.500
<v Speaker 3>your development,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it also really engages you so you're</v>

228
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:40.423
<v Speaker 3>tied right into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really easy to remember and </v>

229
00:11:42.531 --> 00:11:46.670
<v Speaker 3>understand it and you make progress and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's difficult in energy demanding,</v>

230
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:50.390
<v Speaker 3>but you're completely captivated by that</v>
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>

231
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:54.380
<v Speaker 3>That's the right size dragon and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>what your nervous system is telling you.</v>

232
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.120
<v Speaker 3>It's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

233
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.680
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this amount of novel information in this</v>

234
00:11:59.681 --> 00:12:03.730
<v Speaker 3>domain is precisely the amount that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can incorporate,</v>

235
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.013
<v Speaker 3>well optimally transforming the </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge structures that you already </v>

236
00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:12.370
<v Speaker 3>have without exceeding your capacity and</v>
<v Speaker 3>what that does.</v>

237
00:12:12.371 --> 00:12:15.010
<v Speaker 3>The way your nervous system signals that</v>
<v Speaker 3>to you as you get interested in it,</v>

238
00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you white ask yourself like,</v>

239
00:12:17.951 --> 00:12:18.784
<v Speaker 3>why do you get interested in things and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you bordered by some things and some </v>

240
00:12:21.101 --> 00:12:21.934
<v Speaker 3>things are overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you don't have any choice </v>

241
00:12:23.141 --> 00:12:25.240
<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a decision you make,</v>

242
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:26.613
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something you discover as you act </v>

243
00:12:27.821 --> 00:12:28.654
<v Speaker 3>in the world and so dragons of optimal </v>
<v Speaker 3>size are engaging and they push your </v>

244
00:12:34.391 --> 00:12:36.640
<v Speaker 3>development,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if they get too big then they're too</v>

245
00:12:36.641 --> 00:12:37.474
<v Speaker 3>much potential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see an analogy between us and the </v>

246
00:12:42.821 --> 00:12:46.900
<v Speaker 3>story of the baby in the crib ended up </v>
<v Speaker 3>heading everywhere.</v>

247
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.313
<v Speaker 3>It could be that like the thing about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing about that particular symbol </v>

248
00:12:52.751 --> 00:12:56.770
<v Speaker 3>is that it describes the unknown outside</v>
<v Speaker 3>of conceptualization.</v>

249
00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:00.040
<v Speaker 3>It's pure potential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you know,</v>

250
00:13:00.041 --> 00:13:02.140
<v Speaker 3>here's something to think about in </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship to that.</v>

251
00:13:02.141 --> 00:13:02.974
<v Speaker 3>I did a little Ted talk on potential,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which if you're interested in this sort </v>

252
00:13:05.621 --> 00:13:06.610
<v Speaker 3>of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might want to look.</v>

253
00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.610
<v Speaker 3>Look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I,</v>

254
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:09.370
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got it right in that talk.</v>

255
00:13:09.371 --> 00:13:10.810
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

256
00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:13.443
<v Speaker 3>there are different ways of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about what the world's made out of and </v>

257
00:13:16.571 --> 00:13:18.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we think that it's made of matter.</v>

258
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:19.383
<v Speaker 3>That's the basic dogmas of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the materialist ground and I would </v>

259
00:13:23.231 --> 00:13:23.771
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

260
00:13:23.771 --> 00:13:24.604
<v Speaker 3>it's really useful to treat the world as</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's made out of matter and look at </v>

261
00:13:26.951 --> 00:13:29.800
<v Speaker 3>all the things that treating it that way</v>
<v Speaker 3>has allowed us to do.</v>

262
00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:31.083
<v Speaker 3>But that doesn't mean it's the final </v>
<v Speaker 3>statement about the nature of reality </v>

263
00:13:33.731 --> 00:13:34.564
<v Speaker 3>and whatever matter is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is pretty damn strange when you get to </v>

264
00:13:36.971 --> 00:13:37.690
<v Speaker 3>the bottom of it.</v>

265
00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:38.523
<v Speaker 3>We don't understand it at all and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't understand its relationship to </v>

266
00:13:40.751 --> 00:13:43.000
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But putting that aside,</v>

267
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:47.050
<v Speaker 3>we also act as if things other than </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter are real.</v>

268
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:48.303
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we act as if potential is real and </v>

269
00:13:50.561 --> 00:13:51.394
<v Speaker 3>that's a very strange thing because </v>
<v Speaker 3>potential by its very nature is not </v>

270
00:13:54.731 --> 00:13:57.190
<v Speaker 3>really defined because otherwise it </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be potential,</v>

271
00:13:57.191 --> 00:13:58.390
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be actuality.</v>

272
00:13:58.750 --> 00:13:59.583
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of you understand your parents when </v>

273
00:14:01.301 --> 00:14:01.811
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

274
00:14:01.811 --> 00:14:02.644
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should live up to your potential or </v>

275
00:14:04.271 --> 00:14:05.104
<v Speaker 3>there's potential there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would say actually most of the </v>

276
00:14:07.511 --> 00:14:08.344
<v Speaker 3>time when we're dealing with the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we're dealing with is not the </v>

277
00:14:11.141 --> 00:14:15.040
<v Speaker 3>material world per se.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we're dealing with is potential.</v>

278
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:18.250
<v Speaker 3>It's like what we're dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what this could be,</v>

279
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.370
<v Speaker 3>and we're trying to realize the </v>
<v Speaker 3>potential.</v>

280
00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:22.563
<v Speaker 3>And so another thing that you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>think about it think about with regards </v>

281
00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:27.280
<v Speaker 3>to the symbol of the dragon in </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular,</v>

282
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:28.533
<v Speaker 3>it's the Predator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the predatory rep pile more and more </v>

283
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.120
<v Speaker 3>basically is that it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a representation of potential.</v>

284
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:35.851
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

285
00:14:35.851 --> 00:14:38.440
<v Speaker 3>I think the reason that it takes </v>
<v Speaker 3>reptilian forum,</v>

286
00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.780
<v Speaker 3>and we're going to talk about this in </v>
<v Speaker 3>great detail,</v>

287
00:14:40.781 --> 00:14:42.610
<v Speaker 3>is I think that what happened is we </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolved,</v>

288
00:14:42.611 --> 00:14:43.444
<v Speaker 3>is that the systems that we originally </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolved to detect predators constituted </v>

289
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:50.520
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

290
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.353
<v Speaker 3>when we underwent the cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolution that transformed the world </v>

291
00:14:53.871 --> 00:14:57.410
<v Speaker 3>into abstract representations around us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That initial print,</v>

292
00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.333
<v Speaker 3>predatory detection system was </v>
<v Speaker 3>elaborated opt into the system that we </v>

293
00:15:01.881 --> 00:15:05.510
<v Speaker 3>use to detect the unknown as such.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

294
00:15:05.511 --> 00:15:06.344
<v Speaker 3>because it's evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fundamental elements that evolved </v>

295
00:15:09.861 --> 00:15:11.660
<v Speaker 3>over the course of evolution remained in</v>
<v Speaker 3>tact.</v>

296
00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:12.523
<v Speaker 3>We're using the same systems and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>system has a language and so the </v>

297
00:15:15.531 --> 00:15:17.510
<v Speaker 3>language is something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

298
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:22.130
<v Speaker 3>the unexpected event is sort of like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>snake in the grass,</v>

299
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.850
<v Speaker 3>which is perfectly reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can think about it as a metaphor.</v>

300
00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:27.920
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's deeper than a metaphor,</v>

301
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.250
<v Speaker 3>but you can think about it as a metaphor</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I would say,</v>

302
00:15:31.251 --> 00:15:32.870
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are optimal size.</v>

303
00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:34.213
<v Speaker 3>We have optimal sized adversaries and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't think you could live without an </v>

304
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.920
<v Speaker 3>optimal sized adversary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is also an interesting.</v>

305
00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.140
<v Speaker 3>It's a very interesting idea because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

306
00:15:45.141 --> 00:15:46.850
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that people always </v>
<v Speaker 3>ask,</v>

307
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:51.080
<v Speaker 3>this is a very metaphysical discussion </v>
<v Speaker 3>is you know why there has to be evil and</v>

308
00:15:51.081 --> 00:15:53.090
<v Speaker 3>horror in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

309
00:15:53.091 --> 00:15:53.924
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not clear to me that the world </v>

310
00:15:56.211 --> 00:15:57.044
<v Speaker 3>could be constituted in the manner that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's constituted in any acceptable way </v>

311
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:04.060
<v Speaker 3>if there were no adversaries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

312
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:04.933
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the snake in the garden is </v>

313
00:16:05.541 --> 00:16:07.400
<v Speaker 3>necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

314
00:16:07.401 --> 00:16:11.510
<v Speaker 3>maybe that imperfection and also that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that adversary is necessary.</v>

315
00:16:11.511 --> 00:16:14.390
<v Speaker 3>It's the thing that spurs on development</v>
<v Speaker 3>at it.</v>

316
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.300
<v Speaker 3>What would there be without an </v>
<v Speaker 3>adversary?</v>

317
00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.910
<v Speaker 3>Maybe nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

318
00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:22.160
<v Speaker 3>because you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can give you an example.</v>

319
00:16:22.161 --> 00:16:22.994
<v Speaker 3>It's a funny example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this little animal whose name I </v>

320
00:16:25.341 --> 00:16:26.174
<v Speaker 3>cannot remember unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it lives in the ocean and in its </v>

321
00:16:30.351 --> 00:16:32.780
<v Speaker 3>larval stage it has a brain and swims </v>
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>

322
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:34.400
<v Speaker 3>It's a little tiny thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It swims around,</v>

323
00:16:34.401 --> 00:16:35.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like little plank and then so on.</v>

324
00:16:35.991 --> 00:16:37.580
<v Speaker 3>And then at some point during it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>development,</v>

325
00:16:37.581 --> 00:16:38.414
<v Speaker 3>it's fastens itself onto a rock and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>grows into something that sort of looks </v>

326
00:16:41.661 --> 00:16:43.220
<v Speaker 3>like a plant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

327
00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:45.350
<v Speaker 3>but it's stable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It never moves again.</v>

328
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:49.670
<v Speaker 3>So as it develops into this stable rock </v>
<v Speaker 3>cleaning entity,</v>

329
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:54.500
<v Speaker 3>it basically digests its own brain and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then it doesn't need one after that.</v>

330
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:56.930
<v Speaker 3>And the reason it doesn't need one as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

331
00:16:56.931 --> 00:16:58.520
<v Speaker 3>there isn't really anything for it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

332
00:16:58.521 --> 00:17:01.170
<v Speaker 3>It just sits there and filters water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes like a sponge,</v>

333
00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:02.023
<v Speaker 3>sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes the nutrients out of the water </v>

334
00:17:04.851 --> 00:17:09.410
<v Speaker 3>and the brain is just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's extra energy using tissue.</v>

335
00:17:09.411 --> 00:17:12.110
<v Speaker 3>And so it does need the brain anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

336
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.950
<v Speaker 3>so like you don't need to think if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't got an adversary.</v>

337
00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.130
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then you think,</v>

338
00:17:19.131 --> 00:17:21.650
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are there optimal sized adversaries?</v>

339
00:17:21.651 --> 00:17:26.651
<v Speaker 3>And part of the Little Motif of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>story is if you pay careful attention to</v>

340
00:17:27.441 --> 00:17:28.274
<v Speaker 3>things as they change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you can keep the damn adversaries </v>

341
00:17:30.531 --> 00:17:31.364
<v Speaker 3>optimize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that actually it may not be </v>

342
00:17:35.661 --> 00:17:36.494
<v Speaker 3>true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's possible that it's true and </v>

343
00:17:39.711 --> 00:17:40.740
<v Speaker 3>that's something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

344
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:44.510
<v Speaker 3>that's something if you really pay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the question might be,</v>

345
00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.660
<v Speaker 3>and this is something that I thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>about when I was developing all of these</v>

346
00:17:47.661 --> 00:17:49.010
<v Speaker 3>ideas a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

347
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.270
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well there's obviously some things about</v>

348
00:17:51.271 --> 00:17:52.104
<v Speaker 3>existence that aren't exactly the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>you might lay them out if you had the </v>

349
00:17:54.451 --> 00:17:55.680
<v Speaker 3>choice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

350
00:17:55.681 --> 00:17:58.710
<v Speaker 3>like the fact that people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally vulnerable and that you're</v>

351
00:17:58.711 --> 00:18:01.670
<v Speaker 3>imperfect in 50 different ways and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>life is full of suffering.</v>

352
00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:02.533
<v Speaker 3>Then everybody dies and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these things that are existential </v>

353
00:18:04.831 --> 00:18:05.430
<v Speaker 3>nightmares.</v>

354
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:06.120
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

355
00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:06.953
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's easy to judge that is unacceptable </v>

356
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:13.750
<v Speaker 3>and maybe even worse than unacceptable </v>
<v Speaker 3>and intolerable and you know,</v>

357
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:18.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm deserving of obliteration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could even go that far and people do</v>

358
00:18:18.901 --> 00:18:19.734
<v Speaker 3>go that far.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's another question that </v>

359
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.240
<v Speaker 3>question begs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

360
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.313
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe,</v>

361
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:30.920
<v Speaker 3>but maybe if you brought all of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>resources to bear on the problem without</v>

362
00:18:32.221 --> 00:18:33.054
<v Speaker 3>holding back all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that would be okay that you could </v>

363
00:18:35.971 --> 00:18:39.450
<v Speaker 3>master it and that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

364
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:40.583
<v Speaker 3>so you won't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing is you'll never know unless </v>

365
00:18:42.091 --> 00:18:44.850
<v Speaker 3>you try it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing because it's actually a</v>

366
00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.520
<v Speaker 3>claim that requires an existential </v>
<v Speaker 3>proof.</v>

367
00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:51.360
<v Speaker 3>You can't listen to someone tell you </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and even if it's true for them,</v>

368
00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:53.460
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't necessarily mean it would </v>
<v Speaker 3>be true for you.</v>

369
00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.680
<v Speaker 3>The only way you can test a proposition </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that is existentially.</v>

370
00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:57.660
<v Speaker 3>You have to act it out.</v>

371
00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:00.720
<v Speaker 3>But as I mentioned earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see very,</v>

372
00:19:00.721 --> 00:19:04.020
<v Speaker 3>very few truly optimistic ideas in </v>
<v Speaker 3>profound thought.</v>

373
00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:07.170
<v Speaker 3>Most profound ideas are pretty damn </v>
<v Speaker 3>pessimistic,</v>

374
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.510
<v Speaker 3>but this is one I think that's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>exception to that,</v>

375
00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.373
<v Speaker 3>which is it is possible that your </v>
<v Speaker 3>constituted so that you have enough </v>

376
00:19:13.261 --> 00:19:16.170
<v Speaker 3>resources to deal with reality as it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually has.</v>

377
00:19:16.171 --> 00:19:19.290
<v Speaker 3>It actually lays itself out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the ways,</v>

378
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:22.260
<v Speaker 3>and people have been thinking about this</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a very long time too,</v>

379
00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:23.393
<v Speaker 3>is that the most effective one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most effective weapons you have in that </v>

380
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:32.820
<v Speaker 3>engagement is the capacity to pay </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention and paying attention.</v>

381
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:33.953
<v Speaker 3>And it's another thing I've learned over</v>
<v Speaker 3>the years and that's been </v>

382
00:19:35.821 --> 00:19:37.140
<v Speaker 3>extraordinarily useful to me.</v>

383
00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:40.493
<v Speaker 3>We kind of conflate rational thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>with attention and sort of make </v>

384
00:19:44.461 --> 00:19:45.294
<v Speaker 3>attention like the ugly step sister of </v>
<v Speaker 3>rationality in some sense because we </v>

385
00:19:49.051 --> 00:19:49.884
<v Speaker 3>never really considered it as a separate</v>
<v Speaker 3>entity because we are basically </v>

386
00:19:52.141 --> 00:19:52.974
<v Speaker 3>rationalist suddenly believed that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>can deal with the world and irrational </v>

387
00:19:55.401 --> 00:19:56.234
<v Speaker 3>weights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think that's really true </v>

388
00:19:57.481 --> 00:20:00.060
<v Speaker 3>because I think the world has at its </v>
<v Speaker 3>core,</v>

389
00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:05.050
<v Speaker 3>it's existentially irrational.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's too much of that's observed,</v>

390
00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:09.600
<v Speaker 3>observed and arbitrary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is perfectly reasonable to draw a</v>

391
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:13.140
<v Speaker 3>clear distinction between paying </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention and thinking.</v>

392
00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:14.693
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>western culture is elevated thinking in </v>

393
00:20:16.231 --> 00:20:19.110
<v Speaker 3>some sense to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the position of the highest dandy.</v>

394
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.033
<v Speaker 3>But I think we've got that wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think attention is much more powerful </v>

395
00:20:23.131 --> 00:20:23.964
<v Speaker 3>than thinking and that attention that </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking should be the handmaid of </v>

396
00:20:26.971 --> 00:20:29.280
<v Speaker 3>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you pay attention,</v>

397
00:20:29.281 --> 00:20:33.930
<v Speaker 3>you can pay attention to the things you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know and you can become incredibly</v>

398
00:20:33.931 --> 00:20:34.764
<v Speaker 3>powerful if you pay attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things you don't know because you keep </v>

399
00:20:37.321 --> 00:20:39.120
<v Speaker 3>learning and learning and learning and </v>
<v Speaker 3>learning.</v>

400
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:39.953
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a new testament injunction </v>

401
00:20:41.111 --> 00:20:43.080
<v Speaker 3>junction that goes along the lines of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

402
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.943
<v Speaker 3>it's necessary to love your enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I actually think that that's an </v>

403
00:20:47.531 --> 00:20:49.260
<v Speaker 3>existential hint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

404
00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:50.523
<v Speaker 3>if you listen to people converse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if they're ideologically </v>

405
00:20:52.811 --> 00:20:55.390
<v Speaker 3>minded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a socialist on one side and the</v>

406
00:20:55.391 --> 00:20:59.410
<v Speaker 3>conservative on the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All they do is trade platitudes.</v>

407
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:00.633
<v Speaker 3>There's no discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the goal of the discussion is to </v>

408
00:21:04.091 --> 00:21:08.680
<v Speaker 3>humiliate the other person and to prove </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're a priority stance is correct</v>

409
00:21:08.681 --> 00:21:13.210
<v Speaker 3>and that that person is incapable of </v>
<v Speaker 3>conceptualizing the world property.</v>

410
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:14.463
<v Speaker 3>It's like</v>

411
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:17.333
<v Speaker 3>one of the most interesting things about</v>
<v Speaker 3>running into people who think </v>

412
00:21:19.441 --> 00:21:20.274
<v Speaker 3>differently than you if you pay </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention instead of thinking is they </v>

413
00:21:22.471 --> 00:21:24.390
<v Speaker 3>will tell you the weirdest bloody </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

414
00:21:24.391 --> 00:21:25.224
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the things you never possibly have </v>

415
00:21:26.401 --> 00:21:27.600
<v Speaker 3>thought of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

416
00:21:27.601 --> 00:21:30.330
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't mean that you have to fall </v>
<v Speaker 3>over and agree with them immediately,</v>

417
00:21:30.331 --> 00:21:33.420
<v Speaker 3>but what the hell difference does it </v>
<v Speaker 3>make if they don't say what you,</v>

418
00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:36.240
<v Speaker 3>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they'll maybe out of 10 statements</v>

419
00:21:36.241 --> 00:21:37.074
<v Speaker 3>the law for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one that you wouldn't have </v>

420
00:21:37.771 --> 00:21:40.620
<v Speaker 3>conceptualized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the difference between paying</v>

421
00:21:40.621 --> 00:21:45.360
<v Speaker 3>attention and thinking and like people </v>
<v Speaker 3>love to be paid attention to.</v>

422
00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:47.490
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the current currency.</v>

423
00:21:47.491 --> 00:21:52.491
<v Speaker 3>It's human currency is attention and </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention is unbelievably powerful tool.</v>

424
00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:56.340
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things we'll find out is that</v>

425
00:21:56.341 --> 00:21:57.174
<v Speaker 3>the ancient Egyptians actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>conceptualized attention as a guard and </v>

426
00:22:02.251 --> 00:22:03.084
<v Speaker 3>the guard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they conceptualized attention as was </v>

427
00:22:04.171 --> 00:22:05.004
<v Speaker 3>horace.</v>

428
00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:08.100
<v Speaker 3>And you all know of horse because you've</v>
<v Speaker 3>all seen representations.</v>

429
00:22:08.101 --> 00:22:11.580
<v Speaker 3>Of course the famous Egyptian I the </v>
<v Speaker 3>single lie,</v>

430
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:12.423
<v Speaker 3>that's a representation of Horus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Egyptians figured out like for </v>

431
00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:18.980
<v Speaker 3>Mr Damien's avenue for them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the highest human dating,</v>

432
00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:20.003
<v Speaker 3>which is like the most powerful set of </v>
<v Speaker 3>human attributes is to be associated </v>

433
00:22:23.341 --> 00:22:25.170
<v Speaker 3>with one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with language use.</v>

434
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.840
<v Speaker 3>The mesopotamians really nailed that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

435
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:27.833
<v Speaker 3>but even more importantly with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>capacity to pay attention and watch and </v>

436
00:22:31.201 --> 00:22:32.034
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of suspension of judgment so </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to be right or wrong in </v>

437
00:22:35.311 --> 00:22:36.144
<v Speaker 3>the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All you have to do is pay attention and </v>

438
00:22:38.611 --> 00:22:39.444
<v Speaker 3>listen and watch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then potentially a solution will </v>

439
00:22:42.511 --> 00:22:43.380
<v Speaker 3>emerge out of that</v>

440
00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:44.723
<v Speaker 4>and</v>

441
00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:47.803
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>half our brain is visual cortex </v>

442
00:22:48.921 --> 00:22:49.940
<v Speaker 3>approximately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

443
00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:53.090
<v Speaker 3>so paying attention were incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Visual animals,</v>

444
00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.460
<v Speaker 3>paying attention really matters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's harnessing.</v>

445
00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.473
<v Speaker 3>That's visual attention in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's the harnessing of our most </v>

446
00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.550
<v Speaker 3>fundamental cognitive capacities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

447
00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:04.901
<v Speaker 3>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

448
00:23:04.901 --> 00:23:07.480
<v Speaker 3>if you pay attention to things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see what interests you.</v>

449
00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:10.540
<v Speaker 3>And that's also an empirical search in </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sense,</v>

450
00:23:10.541 --> 00:23:11.374
<v Speaker 3>which is quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is part of why I got interested in </v>

451
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.530
<v Speaker 3>psychodynamic ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there are things that rule the</v>

452
00:23:17.531 --> 00:23:20.470
<v Speaker 3>way that you govern yourself that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have no control over.</v>

453
00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.630
<v Speaker 3>You can only discover them and one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them is what interests you sleep.</v>

454
00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:27.590
<v Speaker 3>So you can't really force it if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not interested in something.</v>

455
00:23:27.591 --> 00:23:28.121
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

456
00:23:28.121 --> 00:23:29.920
<v Speaker 3>good luck trying to make yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>interested.</v>

457
00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:31.173
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you can do it to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but more particularly what seems to </v>

458
00:23:34.091 --> 00:23:34.924
<v Speaker 3>happen is that your interest highlights </v>
<v Speaker 3>things for you and then you follow that </v>

459
00:23:37.991 --> 00:23:39.790
<v Speaker 3>around like you're following up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

460
00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:40.703
<v Speaker 3>a search beam or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to me that indicates the action of </v>

461
00:23:44.651 --> 00:23:45.484
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very deep underlying psychobiological </v>

462
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:50.390
<v Speaker 3>systems that in some sense or directing </v>
<v Speaker 3>your consciousness,</v>

463
00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you pay attention to that process,</v>

464
00:23:53.901 --> 00:23:55.760
<v Speaker 3>you can also learn a tremendous amount </v>
<v Speaker 3>from that.</v>

465
00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:58.420
<v Speaker 3>Like what you're actually like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

466
00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.260
<v Speaker 3>what are you interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

467
00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:02.960
<v Speaker 3>where is your being trying to manifest </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>

468
00:24:02.961 --> 00:24:06.380
<v Speaker 3>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those are all things that we're going</v>

469
00:24:06.381 --> 00:24:07.214
<v Speaker 3>to try to figure out because I would </v>
<v Speaker 3>also say that if you're capable of </v>

470
00:24:09.441 --> 00:24:12.620
<v Speaker 3>allowing your true being to manifest </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself,</v>

471
00:24:12.621 --> 00:24:13.454
<v Speaker 3>so that would be your potential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's also the best source you have of </v>

472
00:24:17.001 --> 00:24:21.620
<v Speaker 3>the kind of weaponry that you need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>defend yourself against the inequalities</v>

473
00:24:21.621 --> 00:24:24.230
<v Speaker 3>and tragedies and horrors of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you can,</v>

474
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:29.330
<v Speaker 3>you can reveal yourself in a sense by </v>
<v Speaker 3>pursuing what's illuminated for you.</v>

475
00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:32.270
<v Speaker 3>And I can't tell you whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true,</v>

476
00:24:32.271 --> 00:24:33.104
<v Speaker 3>but it's a powerful idea and it's a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>old idea and I think there's plenty of </v>

477
00:24:38.031 --> 00:24:43.031
<v Speaker 3>evidence that at least it is a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say it's plausible.</v>

478
00:24:45.081 --> 00:24:45.690
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

479
00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:46.820
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more than that.</v>

480
00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.460
<v Speaker 3>It's but plausible will do because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't think of a better word,</v>

481
00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.313
<v Speaker 3>intimate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

482
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:51.620
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

483
00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:55.520
<v Speaker 3>it's a hypothesis that has enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>potential that it might be worth testing</v>

484
00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.410
<v Speaker 3>and I would like you to test that sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of thing.</v>

485
00:24:57.411 --> 00:25:00.710
<v Speaker 3>Like one of the things that I really </v>
<v Speaker 3>encourage students in this class to do,</v>

486
00:25:00.711 --> 00:25:01.544
<v Speaker 3>and you can start doing this right away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is pay attention to what you hear </v>

487
00:25:04.461 --> 00:25:07.100
<v Speaker 3>yourself saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just watch.</v>

488
00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.233
<v Speaker 3>Pull yourself into to detach yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>from your ideas and thoughts and watch </v>

489
00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:17.180
<v Speaker 3>what you say and at the same time that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you watch what you say,</v>

490
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:18.433
<v Speaker 3>watch how you feel when you say what you</v>
<v Speaker 3>say and what I'd like you to try to </v>

491
00:25:22.161 --> 00:25:22.994
<v Speaker 3>detect is you'll notice if you start </v>
<v Speaker 3>noticing that some of the things that </v>

492
00:25:26.301 --> 00:25:27.134
<v Speaker 3>you say make you feel strong and </v>
<v Speaker 3>together and united and other things </v>

493
00:25:30.201 --> 00:25:31.034
<v Speaker 3>that you say make you feel disunited and</v>
<v Speaker 3>week and then I would say quit saying </v>

494
00:25:35.061 --> 00:25:35.894
<v Speaker 3>the ones that make you feel disunited </v>
<v Speaker 3>and weak because they're false and what </v>

495
00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:43.520
<v Speaker 3>and what you're picking up by the loss </v>
<v Speaker 3>of strength associated with that address</v>

496
00:25:43.521 --> 00:25:44.930
<v Speaker 3>is the fact that you're.</v>

497
00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:45.740
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>

498
00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:46.573
<v Speaker 3>There's something rotten in the state of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Denmark with regards to that use of </v>

499
00:25:50.601 --> 00:25:52.250
<v Speaker 3>language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's manipulative.</v>

500
00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.320
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to appear smarter than you</v>

501
00:25:54.321 --> 00:25:55.820
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to prove a point.</v>

502
00:25:55.821 --> 00:25:56.654
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to avoid something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some game you're playing that's </v>

503
00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.193
<v Speaker 3>other than merely stating what you see </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be true at that moment and like </v>

504
00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:06.230
<v Speaker 3>that's a different way to live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

505
00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:07.064
<v Speaker 3>because you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can calculate and you can plan and </v>

506
00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:12.560
<v Speaker 3>planning is useful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have nothing against that,</v>

507
00:26:12.561 --> 00:26:13.394
<v Speaker 3>but you can manipulate reality so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it manifest what you want or you can </v>

508
00:26:18.531 --> 00:26:19.364
<v Speaker 3>decide that what you're going to do is </v>
<v Speaker 3>pay attention and to call things as you </v>

509
00:26:22.971 --> 00:26:26.240
<v Speaker 3>see them and to see what happens if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that.</v>

510
00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:28.340
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a real risk,</v>

511
00:26:28.341 --> 00:26:29.174
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you don't know where that's </v>

512
00:26:30.141 --> 00:26:30.974
<v Speaker 3>going to take you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's an act of faith in the </v>

513
00:26:32.481 --> 00:26:36.200
<v Speaker 3>character guardian sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like if you have faith in the truth,</v>

514
00:26:36.201 --> 00:26:38.510
<v Speaker 3>what that means is that you will say the</v>
<v Speaker 3>truth,</v>

515
00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:40.660
<v Speaker 3>and that's a hard thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know.</v>

516
00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:44.310
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean that you can say </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you want you want regardless of</v>

517
00:26:44.311 --> 00:26:48.630
<v Speaker 3>the effect on other people or that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can use the truth as a baseball bat,</v>

518
00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:52.050
<v Speaker 3>which you can certainly do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's sophisticated.</v>

519
00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:53.453
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it requires a tremendous amount of </v>

520
00:26:54.751 --> 00:26:55.650
<v Speaker 3>sophisticated,</v>

521
00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:57.013
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

522
00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:01.870
<v Speaker 3>it requires a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sophistication.</v>

523
00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:05.440
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing you might think about is,</v>

524
00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.760
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>

525
00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:11.980
<v Speaker 3>if you are attempting to make yourself a</v>
<v Speaker 3>mouthpiece of the truth,</v>

526
00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:13.840
<v Speaker 3>you have reality on your side</v>

527
00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:17.060
<v Speaker 3>and then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

528
00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:18.763
<v Speaker 3>could you possibly have anything more </v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful on your side in reality and so </v>

529
00:27:23.361 --> 00:27:24.194
<v Speaker 3>it might not be a reality you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or the thing that you would wish for </v>

530
00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.700
<v Speaker 3>what you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you know,</v>

531
00:27:28.701 --> 00:27:32.150
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you called things as you saw them and</v>

532
00:27:32.151 --> 00:27:32.984
<v Speaker 3>you were very careful about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that would lead you through life </v>

533
00:27:35.991 --> 00:27:36.824
<v Speaker 3>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very different way of thinking </v>

534
00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:40.633
<v Speaker 3>and it is tied with this idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something fundamental about the </v>

535
00:27:43.491 --> 00:27:45.140
<v Speaker 3>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would say to start this,</v>

536
00:27:45.141 --> 00:27:48.230
<v Speaker 3>if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just pay attention to what you say.</v>

537
00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:51.110
<v Speaker 3>You know when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when like you're detached from it.</v>

538
00:27:51.111 --> 00:27:51.944
<v Speaker 3>So don't identify too much with what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying because that's another </v>

539
00:27:54.291 --> 00:27:56.870
<v Speaker 3>thing that people do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They identify with what they think.</v>

540
00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:58.263
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what makes you think that you're </v>

541
00:27:59.001 --> 00:28:02.120
<v Speaker 3>thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like one of the things you said,</v>

542
00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:03.700
<v Speaker 3>which I really love that he blew me.</v>

543
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:06.320
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just slapped me when I first read it.</v>

544
00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:09.440
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people do not have ideas,</v>

545
00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.100
<v Speaker 3>ideas have people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

546
00:28:13.101 --> 00:28:13.934
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I listened to ideologues talk all the </v>

547
00:28:15.321 --> 00:28:18.080
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like damn talking in some dead,</v>

548
00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.780
<v Speaker 3>dead spirit of the past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

549
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:21.823
<v Speaker 3>voicing an opinion through them and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can tell when you're talking to someone </v>

550
00:28:24.471 --> 00:28:26.780
<v Speaker 3>like that because you can predict </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything you're going to say.</v>

551
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:31.520
<v Speaker 3>So in what sense is that them talking?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It isn't them talking at all,</v>

552
00:28:31.521 --> 00:28:34.570
<v Speaker 3>at some collective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a collective voice that,</v>

553
00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:38.270
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that has appropriated them and convinced</v>

554
00:28:38.271 --> 00:28:41.610
<v Speaker 3>them that it's actually part of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

555
00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.640
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the devil.</v>

556
00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.340
<v Speaker 3>That's what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

557
00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:47.563
<v Speaker 3>so we'll just watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can try this experimental on your </v>

558
00:28:49.581 --> 00:28:51.260
<v Speaker 3>own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried for a month,</v>

559
00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:56.150
<v Speaker 3>detach yourself from what you say and </v>
<v Speaker 3>think and notice when you say something,</v>

560
00:28:56.151 --> 00:28:56.984
<v Speaker 3>if it makes you feel more grounded and </v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful or weaker and stop saying </v>

561
00:29:00.321 --> 00:29:03.140
<v Speaker 3>things that make you weak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

562
00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:04.103
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's sort of like Ed's essential test </v>

563
00:29:05.571 --> 00:29:07.540
<v Speaker 3>number one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

564
00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:11.240
<v Speaker 3>Well it must be just about four x four </v>
<v Speaker 3>or three.</v>

565
00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:12.343
<v Speaker 3>So then I'll see you all next Wednesday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take a look at the website and I would </v>

566
00:29:16.311 --> 00:29:18.830
<v Speaker 3>say start those exercises or at least </v>
<v Speaker 3>check them out.</v>

567
00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:19.723
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
