<v Speaker 1>Jordan peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology professor at the University </v>

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:04.771
<v Speaker 1>of Western Ontario,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

3
00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:08.070
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm been there,</v>

4
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.053
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some years a SAF Scott involved because </v>

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.833
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.800
<v Speaker 1>we were sent the letters that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Dr Peterson's Dean and then a vice provo</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>

8
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:22.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.030
<v Speaker 1>had sent him and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

10
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:26.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they worried us so tremendously as,</v>

11
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.893
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as people concerned about academic </v>

12
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:30.870
<v Speaker 1>freedom and the integrity of teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

13
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:32.341
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:35.930
<v Speaker 1>the letters warned Dr Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:36.803
<v Speaker 1>to stop saying publicly that he would </v>
<v Speaker 1>refuse requests to use a non gendered </v>

16
00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:43.130
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

17
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.711
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:46.340
<v Speaker 1>additional pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

19
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.840
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:48.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for us.</v>

22
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:55.281
<v Speaker 1>So it was a very serious matter very </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously in an incursion on the freedom</v>

23
00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:56.994
<v Speaker 1>of teachers to teach as they will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teaching has a lot to do with the </v>

24
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:06.561
<v Speaker 1>rapport between the professor and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>student between a classroom dynamics and</v>

25
00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:08.274
<v Speaker 1>the honesty and sincerity that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching requires we thought were </v>

26
00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:12.594
<v Speaker 1>infringed by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by these orders and especially orders </v>

27
00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:16.340
<v Speaker 1>coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.020
<v Speaker 1>from deans and department to department </v>
<v Speaker 1>heads.</v>

29
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

30
00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:22.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we wrote letters,</v>

31
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a University of Toronto about this.</v>

32
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.383
<v Speaker 1>So we're very privileged to have Dr </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson with us today to talk to us </v>

33
00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:32.610
<v Speaker 1>about these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

34
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.473
<v Speaker 1>maybe also a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some more theoretical and abstract </v>

35
00:01:36.991 --> 00:01:39.090
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then his own their particular case.</v>

36
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.373
<v Speaker 1>He's going to talk to us about why </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom of speech is not just another </v>

37
00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:47.370
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson.</v>

38
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.090
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>

39
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.393
<v Speaker 1>So I thought I'd start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to approach this from three </v>

40
00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:03.880
<v Speaker 1>directions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I are in three sections.</v>

41
00:02:03.881 --> 00:02:08.881
<v Speaker 1>I thought I'd start by just letting you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know why I was objecting specifically to</v>

42
00:02:09.971 --> 00:02:11.770
<v Speaker 1>build [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

43
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.010
<v Speaker 1>I made three videos in late September </v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

44
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.843
<v Speaker 1>one of them criticized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>built see 16 and one of them criticize </v>

45
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.880
<v Speaker 1>the University of Toronto </v>
<v Speaker 1>Administrations,</v>

46
00:02:24.881 --> 00:02:25.714
<v Speaker 1>the human resources peoples decision to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make so called anti unconscious anti </v>

47
00:02:32.231 --> 00:02:36.190
<v Speaker 1>bias training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mandatory for their HR staff,</v>

48
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.130
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was and still think was </v>
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible.</v>

49
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.720
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

50
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.390
<v Speaker 1>don't even remember what the other one </v>
<v Speaker 1>was about,</v>

51
00:02:46.391 --> 00:02:47.710
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are,</v>

52
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:48.773
<v Speaker 1>that was the first one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one on bill [inaudible] that caused </v>

53
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.590
<v Speaker 1>most of the fewer surprisingly enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said I wouldn't use the made up.</v>

54
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.210
<v Speaker 1>What I consider you a isms that purport </v>
<v Speaker 1>to describe the status,</v>

55
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.890
<v Speaker 1>the status of people whose sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity is ambiguous because that isn't</v>

56
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:13.270
<v Speaker 1>how it looked to me.</v>

57
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.103
<v Speaker 1>It looked to me like these words like </v>
<v Speaker 1>CSI and xer and so forth were the </v>

58
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:19.834
<v Speaker 1>linguistic vanguard of a intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement that I would say detest is </v>

59
00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:25.774
<v Speaker 1>probably the right description and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's strange blend of postmodernism </v>

60
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:32.344
<v Speaker 1>and Marxism that has emerged to occupy </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bulk of the humanities and a good </v>

61
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:38.344
<v Speaker 1>chunk of the social sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that was the first thing is that </v>

62
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.633
<v Speaker 1>I'm not using those words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the first thing that was </v>

63
00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:46.030
<v Speaker 1>personal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

64
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:51.031
<v Speaker 1>Is that that's not a form of linguistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>game that I'm willing to play and I have</v>

65
00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:55.760
<v Speaker 1>my reasons for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second was I regard the ledge.</v>

66
00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.780
<v Speaker 1>Any legislation that compels people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>use a certain kind of language as a very</v>

67
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:02.830
<v Speaker 1>dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

68
00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:07.240
<v Speaker 1>dangerous piece of legislation directly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also a very dangerous precedent.</v>

69
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are limits on free speech that are</v>

70
00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:13.600
<v Speaker 1>already reasonably well instantiated in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the law.</v>

71
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:14.643
<v Speaker 1>You can't incite a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't threaten someone bodily and </v>

72
00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:19.024
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't libel someone we already have </v>

73
00:04:23.171 --> 00:04:27.670
<v Speaker 1>reasonable restrictions on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on what you can't say,</v>

74
00:04:27.671 --> 00:04:28.504
<v Speaker 1>but we've never had legislation that </v>
<v Speaker 1>required you to use a certain language </v>

75
00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:34.450
<v Speaker 1>except in certain commercial </v>
<v Speaker 1>applications.</v>

76
00:04:34.451 --> 00:04:36.220
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you sell tobacco,</v>

77
00:04:36.221 --> 00:04:37.810
<v Speaker 1>you have to put a warning on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

78
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States Supreme Court decided,</v>

79
00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:42.034
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was in the 19 forties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that similar attempts to compel speech </v>

80
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:46.723
<v Speaker 1>on the part of individuals in </v>
<v Speaker 1>noncommercial settings was </v>

81
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:49.990
<v Speaker 1>unconstitutional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

82
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.070
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

83
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.800
<v Speaker 1>I know that that doesn't have any direct</v>
<v Speaker 1>bearing on Canadian law,</v>

84
00:04:53.801 --> 00:04:58.801
<v Speaker 1>but certainly the principal does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I was also very see,</v>

85
00:04:58.961 --> 00:05:01.060
<v Speaker 1>one of the problems with a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>legislation,</v>

86
00:05:01.061 --> 00:05:01.894
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose the problem with interpreting </v>

87
00:05:03.641 --> 00:05:04.474
<v Speaker 1>a text as the postmodernists would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it's not easy to get the level </v>

88
00:05:07.121 --> 00:05:08.620
<v Speaker 1>of interpretation right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

89
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.000
<v Speaker 1>Because you're interpreting a text.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can look at the,</v>

90
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.710
<v Speaker 1>you can look at the letters that happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>with biblical interpretation.</v>

91
00:05:14.711 --> 00:05:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Very often you can look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual words,</v>

92
00:05:16.721 --> 00:05:18.430
<v Speaker 1>you can look at the phrases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get,</v>

93
00:05:18.431 --> 00:05:20.320
<v Speaker 1>the sentences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can look at the paragraphs,</v>

94
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.543
<v Speaker 1>you could look at the work as a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you also have to look at the </v>

95
00:05:24.071 --> 00:05:24.904
<v Speaker 1>context within which the work is being </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpreted in order to come up with an </v>

96
00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:30.370
<v Speaker 1>interpretation of anything that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex.</v>

97
00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:32.260
<v Speaker 1>And so when you see a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>legislation,</v>

98
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.753
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious what the legislation is</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually intended to do despite what </v>

99
00:05:39.101 --> 00:05:39.934
<v Speaker 1>it's purported to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't obvious what level of </v>

100
00:05:42.311 --> 00:05:44.650
<v Speaker 1>analysis to pick when you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticize it.</v>

101
00:05:44.651 --> 00:05:49.360
<v Speaker 1>And in some ways bill [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could regard it as innocuous just as</v>

102
00:05:49.361 --> 00:05:52.900
<v Speaker 1>an extension of rights that have already</v>
<v Speaker 1>been granted to certain,</v>

103
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.400
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>protected groups.</v>

104
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.233
<v Speaker 1>Although I'm not so thrilled about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole notion of ascribing rights to </v>

105
00:05:57.951 --> 00:06:00.590
<v Speaker 1>groups to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're already far down that path.</v>

106
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.963
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

107
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:03.493
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been accused of making a mountain </v>

108
00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:07.210
<v Speaker 1>out of a mole hill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but happily enough,</v>

109
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.890
<v Speaker 1>the University of Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after I made the videos,</v>

110
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:10.724
<v Speaker 1>immediately produced two letters that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were informed by their legal </v>

111
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.330
<v Speaker 1>departments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wisdom,</v>

112
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.063
<v Speaker 1>I'm stating that what I had done with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the video was perhaps in conflict with </v>

113
00:06:23.991 --> 00:06:24.824
<v Speaker 1>the university ethical guidelines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you forget the ones that had to do </v>

114
00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:30.110
<v Speaker 1>with freedom of expression and that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>might,</v>

115
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:31.243
<v Speaker 1>that my actions and even in making the </v>
<v Speaker 1>video might have violated that the </v>

116
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.113
<v Speaker 1>tenants of the Ontario Human Rights Act </v>
<v Speaker 1>as it's or they at least as it's </v>

117
00:06:38.991 --> 00:06:41.030
<v Speaker 1>interpreted by the Ontario Human Rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>Commission.</v>

118
00:06:41.031 --> 00:06:41.864
<v Speaker 1>And so that helped put to rest any </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggestion that I was actually </v>

119
00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:50.351
<v Speaker 1>scaremongering because as soon as I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as I made the videos,</v>

120
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.230
<v Speaker 1>the legal department at the uft </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately validated my fears.</v>

121
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.140
<v Speaker 1>And so that was a perverse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a perverse effect of their,</v>

122
00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.810
<v Speaker 1>of the letters they sent to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

123
00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that I,</v>

124
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.463
<v Speaker 1>there was other elements of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>legislation that I object to and </v>

125
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:07.543
<v Speaker 1>objected to and still do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you read the policies within </v>

126
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:14.270
<v Speaker 1>which the legislation will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpreted as the federal justice,</v>

127
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.573
<v Speaker 1>a website indicated that it would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpreted in within the policies that </v>

128
00:07:18.741 --> 00:07:21.140
<v Speaker 1>the Ontario Human Rights Commission is </v>
<v Speaker 1>already established.</v>

129
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:22.003
<v Speaker 1>Of course there's close cross talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>between Ontario and the federal </v>

130
00:07:24.501 --> 00:07:28.220
<v Speaker 1>government because the liberals are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>power in both and the radical end of the</v>

131
00:07:28.221 --> 00:07:32.980
<v Speaker 1>liberal party's in power in both </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations and know it.</v>

132
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.100
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that it's illegal for like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're liable as an employer.</v>

133
00:07:37.101 --> 00:07:37.934
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if any of your employees say anything </v>

134
00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:44.120
<v Speaker 1>that can be construed as harassment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say on the grounds of sexual</v>

135
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:46.843
<v Speaker 1>or gender identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if what they say has unintended </v>

136
00:07:50.721 --> 00:07:54.350
<v Speaker 1>consequences and even if you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they said it.</v>

137
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.243
<v Speaker 1>And so that kind of legislation I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>think is just absolutely reprehensible </v>

138
00:07:59.060 --> 00:07:59.893
<v Speaker 1>and then because it's designed to cast </v>
<v Speaker 1>the broadest possible net to catch the </v>

139
00:08:03.231 --> 00:08:04.064
<v Speaker 1>most fish and it's clearly being </v>
<v Speaker 1>implemented by people who are not </v>

140
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.060
<v Speaker 1>precisely pro employer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's put it that way.</v>

141
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.223
<v Speaker 1>And then there's another little ugly </v>
<v Speaker 1>secret hidden underneath the policies </v>

142
00:08:16.341 --> 00:08:17.174
<v Speaker 1>and that's manifests most clearly in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>form of what's come to be known as the </v>

143
00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:22.813
<v Speaker 1>Gender Unicorn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which I would recommend that you look </v>

144
00:08:23.571 --> 00:08:24.404
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an animated character designed </v>

145
00:08:27.141 --> 00:08:31.940
<v Speaker 1>to indoctrinate small children into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>social constructionist worldview.</v>

146
00:08:31.941 --> 00:08:36.941
<v Speaker 1>Which claims that biological sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender identity,</v>

147
00:08:37.311 --> 00:08:38.144
<v Speaker 1>gender expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sexual proclivity very </v>

148
00:08:40.401 --> 00:08:43.370
<v Speaker 1>independently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they most certainly do,</v>

149
00:08:43.371 --> 00:08:45.800
<v Speaker 1>not now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I said in the video.</v>

150
00:08:45.801 --> 00:08:47.530
<v Speaker 1>That's partly why I've been accused of </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

151
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.413
<v Speaker 1>being a transphobic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also complained that the university </v>

152
00:08:50.841 --> 00:08:55.710
<v Speaker 1>was taking policy advice from the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who started black lives matter.</v>

153
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.470
<v Speaker 1>And I don't have anything against black </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives matter particularly,</v>

154
00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:00.910
<v Speaker 1>but the two people who started it are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not,</v>

155
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

156
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:03.143
<v Speaker 1>this sorts of individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say that the university should be </v>

157
00:09:05.071 --> 00:09:05.904
<v Speaker 1>basing its policy decisions that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>advice they shouldn't be taking advice </v>

158
00:09:09.571 --> 00:09:11.460
<v Speaker 1>from those people with regards to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>policy.</v>

159
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:12.294
<v Speaker 1>And apparently that makes me a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first part of the argument about </v>

160
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:19.650
<v Speaker 1>what happened with my videos was </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually whether or not I was racist and</v>

161
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:20.653
<v Speaker 1>Trans phobic and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point that I was making the </v>

162
00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:24.624
<v Speaker 1>technical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>specific technical point was that the </v>

163
00:09:26.461 --> 00:09:28.370
<v Speaker 1>claim that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

164
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:33.660
<v Speaker 1>those four phenomena very independently </v>
<v Speaker 1>was just patently false.</v>

165
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.080
<v Speaker 1>And it is by any reasonable definition </v>
<v Speaker 1>of false.</v>

166
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:42.510
<v Speaker 1>And I know that it's part of a much </v>
<v Speaker 1>broader propaganda exercise as evidenced</v>

167
00:09:42.511 --> 00:09:44.280
<v Speaker 1>by the Gender Unicorn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

168
00:09:44.281 --> 00:09:49.281
<v Speaker 1>which gets children to indicate on four </v>
<v Speaker 1>sliders their sex assigned at birth,</v>

169
00:09:49.981 --> 00:09:52.290
<v Speaker 1>their gender identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their gender expression,</v>

170
00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:53.730
<v Speaker 1>and their sexual proclivity.</v>

171
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.030
<v Speaker 1>And you can look at the animation and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at the,</v>

172
00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:00.570
<v Speaker 1>at the cartoon and decide for yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>by its graphic style,</v>

173
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:03.810
<v Speaker 1>what Ange people it's aimed at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

174
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:05.143
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this a bill to protect transexual </v>

175
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:12.930
<v Speaker 1>rights?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is it a bill to further a postmodern,</v>

176
00:10:12.931 --> 00:10:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Neo Marxist agenda?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

177
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.370
<v Speaker 1>God only knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as far as I'm concerned,</v>

178
00:10:17.371 --> 00:10:22.371
<v Speaker 1>having analyzed the context within which</v>
<v Speaker 1>this bill arose and within which it will</v>

179
00:10:23.221 --> 00:10:24.054
<v Speaker 1>be interpreted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go for the furthering the </v>

180
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:29.550
<v Speaker 1>postmodern Neil Marxist agenda until </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

181
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.533
<v Speaker 1>Until that's thoroughly disproved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would also like to inform you that </v>

182
00:10:33.541 --> 00:10:36.150
<v Speaker 1>I've had plenty of letters from </v>
<v Speaker 1>transgender people,</v>

183
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.860
<v Speaker 1>at least 30 and only one of them was </v>
<v Speaker 1>critical of what I'm doing because they,</v>

184
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:41.873
<v Speaker 1>they claim and as happy as have many of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people I've talked to that the idea </v>

185
00:10:47.971 --> 00:10:48.804
<v Speaker 1>that a group of activists self can self </v>
<v Speaker 1>nominate as the representatives of a </v>

186
00:10:54.901 --> 00:10:55.734
<v Speaker 1>given group and then speak for them as </v>
<v Speaker 1>if they have a homogenous voice is </v>

187
00:10:58.831 --> 00:11:00.900
<v Speaker 1>absolutely absurd.</v>

188
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.450
<v Speaker 1>And it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is completely ridiculous.</v>

189
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.673
<v Speaker 1>And most of the transsexual people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been contacting me have said the </v>

190
00:11:08.491 --> 00:11:09.324
<v Speaker 1>same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is these people don't speak for </v>

191
00:11:11.101 --> 00:11:11.934
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish they'd shut up because they're </v>

192
00:11:13.441 --> 00:11:18.441
<v Speaker 1>doing a lot more harm than good and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't buy what they're doing anyways.</v>

193
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.340
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

194
00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:21.893
<v Speaker 1>I think that the claim of the activist </v>
<v Speaker 1>types to speak on behalf of the groups </v>

195
00:11:26.011 --> 00:11:28.560
<v Speaker 1>that they purport to represent is weak </v>
<v Speaker 1>at best.</v>

196
00:11:28.561 --> 00:11:30.560
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know why we ever assumed </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it,</v>

197
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:31.733
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that their representation is valid </v>

198
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:36.600
<v Speaker 1>except that we're afraid to criticize </v>
<v Speaker 1>that particular presupposition.</v>

199
00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:37.411
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

200
00:11:37.411 --> 00:11:40.490
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing more ridiculous than </v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming that someone is.</v>

201
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Because someone is black that they speak</v>
<v Speaker 1>for black people.</v>

202
00:11:43.561 --> 00:11:44.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

203
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:45.623
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of anything that's more </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly indicative of a </v>

204
00:11:48.181 --> 00:11:50.990
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally racist attitude than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

205
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Well those people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all the same.</v>

206
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.801
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

207
00:11:53.801 --> 00:11:54.760
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

208
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:59.770
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work out that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to clarify all that so that,</v>

209
00:11:59.771 --> 00:12:02.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a little bit clearer idea about</v>

210
00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:07.150
<v Speaker 1>why I was doing what I was doing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have asked so to speak,</v>

211
00:12:07.151 --> 00:12:09.790
<v Speaker 1>why I chose to die on that particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>hale.</v>

212
00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:14.740
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every massive conflict of ideas,</v>

213
00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:17.530
<v Speaker 1>let's say manifests itself in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>

214
00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:23.230
<v Speaker 1>And that's why it's often difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 1>gain any headway because no matter where</v>

215
00:12:23.231 --> 00:12:25.090
<v Speaker 1>you draw the line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's arbitrary.</v>

216
00:12:25.091 --> 00:12:27.760
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and subject to criticism and you know,</v>

217
00:12:27.761 --> 00:12:30.480
<v Speaker 1>the fact that this happens to be about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

218
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:35.200
<v Speaker 1>gender neutral pronouns regarding </v>
<v Speaker 1>transgender people to me is just more or</v>

219
00:12:35.201 --> 00:12:36.034
<v Speaker 1>less an accident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would have been about almost any </v>

220
00:12:37.691 --> 00:12:38.524
<v Speaker 1>number of other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would also like to suggest that </v>

221
00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:43.870
<v Speaker 1>what should have happened with what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>did was nothing.</v>

222
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.273
<v Speaker 1>I made some videos that are on board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively obscure academic and I made </v>

223
00:12:50.021 --> 00:12:50.854
<v Speaker 1>some videos in my private time that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty badly produced because they're </v>

224
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:55.383
<v Speaker 1>just amateur and I was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>straighten out my thinking about a </v>

225
00:12:58.301 --> 00:12:59.134
<v Speaker 1>couple of issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anti unconscious bias training for </v>

226
00:13:01.421 --> 00:13:02.254
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also this legislative mess and </v>

227
00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:07.023
<v Speaker 1>obviously it struck a major chord and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that to me is indication that my </v>

228
00:13:10.841 --> 00:13:11.674
<v Speaker 1>original supposition was correct and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there was far more going on under </v>

229
00:13:15.281 --> 00:13:17.380
<v Speaker 1>the surface than there was at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>surface.</v>

230
00:13:17.381 --> 00:13:18.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

231
00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:19.443
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to pick the proper </v>

232
00:13:20.561 --> 00:13:21.394
<v Speaker 1>level of analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the ways you justify your </v>

233
00:13:24.431 --> 00:13:25.264
<v Speaker 1>choices by observing the impact of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice of level of analysis and seeing </v>

234
00:13:28.901 --> 00:13:29.734
<v Speaker 1>if it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the consequences are commensurate </v>

235
00:13:31.361 --> 00:13:32.194
<v Speaker 1>with your original hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought well just because people </v>

236
00:13:36.851 --> 00:13:37.684
<v Speaker 1>say they're doing one thing with a piece</v>
<v Speaker 1>of legislation doesn't mean that that's </v>

237
00:13:41.411 --> 00:13:42.220
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing.</v>

238
00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.400
<v Speaker 1>And of course a lead piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>legislation is a hydra.</v>

239
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:46.623
<v Speaker 1>In any case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does all sorts of things that people </v>

240
00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:48.994
<v Speaker 1>don't intend it to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a little background and I'll </v>

241
00:13:53.771 --> 00:13:54.604
<v Speaker 1>leave the background at that and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk to you now from a practical </v>

242
00:13:58.361 --> 00:14:02.890
<v Speaker 1>perspective why I believe that the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>of freedom of speech is not just another</v>

243
00:14:02.891 --> 00:14:07.540
<v Speaker 1>value among other values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that the simplest reason for</v>

244
00:14:07.541 --> 00:14:12.180
<v Speaker 1>that is that speech isn't precisely a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanism.</v>

245
00:14:12.181 --> 00:14:13.020
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

246
00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:14.860
<v Speaker 1>it's a process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

247
00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:16.270
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

248
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:19.570
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a generative process.</v>

249
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Speech free speech is the process by </v>
<v Speaker 1>which all ideas are generated and I want</v>

250
00:14:26.371 --> 00:14:27.204
<v Speaker 1>to make it clear why I believe that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be the case with speech specifically </v>

251
00:14:31.331 --> 00:14:32.560
<v Speaker 1>because you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

252
00:14:32.561 --> 00:14:34.360
<v Speaker 1>that's thought but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

253
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.373
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because thing is that thought is a far </v>

254
00:14:38.891 --> 00:14:42.610
<v Speaker 1>more collective enterprise than people </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally understand.</v>

255
00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:43.443
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the thoughts you have aren't </v>

256
00:14:45.731 --> 00:14:46.900
<v Speaker 1>your thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

257
00:14:46.901 --> 00:14:47.734
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember who it was that said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that everyone is the unconscious </v>

258
00:14:52.071 --> 00:14:56.180
<v Speaker 1>exponent of a dead philosopher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's definitely the case.</v>

259
00:14:56.181 --> 00:14:57.014
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are very linguistic mechanisms by which </v>

260
00:15:00.321 --> 00:15:03.440
<v Speaker 1>we formulate our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our grip on the world,</v>

261
00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.690
<v Speaker 1>our collective constructs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

262
00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:06.643
<v Speaker 1>and in some cases almost entirely </v>
<v Speaker 1>because creative thought is far rarer </v>

263
00:15:10.161 --> 00:15:10.994
<v Speaker 1>than people generally presume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that when we're </v>

264
00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:16.910
<v Speaker 1>speaking and when we're thinking we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually using,</v>

265
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:19.910
<v Speaker 1>if not cliches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very frequently the case,</v>

266
00:15:19.911 --> 00:15:20.744
<v Speaker 1>as you know perfectly well if you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever a graded a particularly bad </v>

267
00:15:24.321 --> 00:15:25.154
<v Speaker 1>undergraduate essay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even among more sophisticated </v>

268
00:15:27.591 --> 00:15:28.424
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's generally the case that they're </v>

269
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:33.140
<v Speaker 1>acting as avatars of ideas that they did</v>
<v Speaker 1>not produce.</v>

270
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:37.490
<v Speaker 1>And so that doesn't mean they can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>further the ideas,</v>

271
00:15:37.491 --> 00:15:38.810
<v Speaker 1>but the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

272
00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.353
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're born into a linguistically </v>

273
00:15:41.571 --> 00:15:42.404
<v Speaker 1>mediated culture and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's mediated at all of the multiple </v>

274
00:15:45.891 --> 00:15:46.724
<v Speaker 1>levels of analysis that I already </v>
<v Speaker 1>described and were shaped in the way </v>

275
00:15:50.631 --> 00:15:54.110
<v Speaker 1>that we view the world with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the input that,</v>

276
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.490
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we received.</v>

277
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:57.710
<v Speaker 1>That's collective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We learn language from other people.</v>

278
00:15:57.711 --> 00:15:58.544
<v Speaker 1>We use the words that other people use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we use the phrases that other people </v>

279
00:16:01.071 --> 00:16:03.770
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an intensely collective exercise,</v>

280
00:16:03.771 --> 00:16:07.880
<v Speaker 1>but even more specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's from a general perspective,</v>

281
00:16:07.881 --> 00:16:10.610
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even more specifically,</v>

282
00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:15.980
<v Speaker 1>the problem with thinking is that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very narrow channel,</v>

283
00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:16.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

284
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:17.623
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of world and there isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>very much of you and that means that </v>

285
00:16:20.301 --> 00:16:21.134
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot more that you filter out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there is that you take in and </v>

286
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.600
<v Speaker 1>you're filtering is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very intensive.</v>

287
00:16:26.601 --> 00:16:28.940
<v Speaker 1>It's dependent to some degree on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>embodiment.</v>

288
00:16:28.941 --> 00:16:29.774
<v Speaker 1>It's dependent to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far more than people generally realize </v>

289
00:16:32.331 --> 00:16:34.940
<v Speaker 1>on your motivations and your and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperament,</v>

290
00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:35.803
<v Speaker 1>which is a topic we'll return to and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's further narrowed by your </v>

291
00:16:40.761 --> 00:16:41.594
<v Speaker 1>position in society and by the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have around you and by your </v>

292
00:16:44.361 --> 00:16:47.420
<v Speaker 1>particular domain of expertise or lack </v>
<v Speaker 1>thereof.</v>

293
00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:48.763
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there are sets of darker </v>

294
00:16:51.111 --> 00:16:51.944
<v Speaker 1>motivations as well that blind you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain things that you should be able </v>

295
00:16:54.321 --> 00:16:59.321
<v Speaker 1>to see but either don't or won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the problem with thinking is that</v>

296
00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.060
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a narrow channel B,</v>

297
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:02.923
<v Speaker 1>you're not very good at it and see your </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly biased and there isn't much </v>

298
00:17:05.901 --> 00:17:06.734
<v Speaker 1>you can do about that except</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen and talk to other people because </v>

299
00:17:12.771 --> 00:17:13.910
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

300
00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.460
<v Speaker 1>they're not the only source of </v>
<v Speaker 1>correction,</v>

301
00:17:16.461 --> 00:17:18.780
<v Speaker 1>but there are pretty intense source of </v>
<v Speaker 1>correction.</v>

302
00:17:18.781 --> 00:17:21.080
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're blasting corrective information at</v>

303
00:17:21.081 --> 00:17:22.280
<v Speaker 1>each other all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

304
00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in a situation like this,</v>

305
00:17:24.621 --> 00:17:27.320
<v Speaker 1>which you could think of as a monologue </v>
<v Speaker 1>but isn't.</v>

306
00:17:27.321 --> 00:17:30.200
<v Speaker 1>It's a dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason I'm watching all of you is to</v>

307
00:17:30.201 --> 00:17:31.340
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

308
00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.130
<v Speaker 1>are you paying attention?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if not,</v>

309
00:17:34.131 --> 00:17:37.400
<v Speaker 1>I better adjust what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do your facial expressions,</v>

310
00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:38.743
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>indicate that you're understanding what </v>

311
00:17:40.401 --> 00:17:41.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying and following it.</v>

312
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:43.640
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're nodding your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your eyes are open,</v>

313
00:17:43.641 --> 00:17:45.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some specific way you're,</v>

314
00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.900
<v Speaker 1>you're actually facing me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your eyes are on me.</v>

315
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:48.943
<v Speaker 1>I can read your facial expressions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is always why I'm looking at </v>

316
00:17:51.031 --> 00:17:51.864
<v Speaker 1>individuals in the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm constantly calibrating what I'm </v>

317
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:57.900
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's a dynamic conversation to ensure</v>

318
00:17:57.901 --> 00:17:58.734
<v Speaker 1>that the information flow is maximized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I look at your eyes is </v>

319
00:18:01.591 --> 00:18:02.880
<v Speaker 1>because I can tell where they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>pointing.</v>

320
00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:06.330
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I look at your face is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're broadcasting motivational</v>

321
00:18:06.331 --> 00:18:09.030
<v Speaker 1>and emotional information nonstop at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

322
00:18:09.031 --> 00:18:12.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so even in a situation like this,</v>

323
00:18:12.571 --> 00:18:14.730
<v Speaker 1>which like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is more more analog than,</v>

324
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:15.863
<v Speaker 1>than otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a tremendous amount of </v>

325
00:18:17.551 --> 00:18:22.080
<v Speaker 1>corrective information continually </v>
<v Speaker 1>flowing between speaker and listener,</v>

326
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:23.600
<v Speaker 1>and if that stops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

327
00:18:23.601 --> 00:18:24.434
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you hear a speaker who's detached </v>

328
00:18:25.681 --> 00:18:27.840
<v Speaker 1>from the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often someone who's reading,</v>

329
00:18:27.841 --> 00:18:28.674
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's much more difficult to listen to </v>

330
00:18:30.061 --> 00:18:30.894
<v Speaker 1>them as everyone knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's because there's a deadness </v>

331
00:18:33.361 --> 00:18:36.000
<v Speaker 1>about reading something in front of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

332
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.250
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason for that is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that living,</v>

333
00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:39.413
<v Speaker 1>let's call it spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't manifesting itself in the same </v>

334
00:18:41.881 --> 00:18:42.714
<v Speaker 1>manner as it is when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the speech is both spontaneous and </v>

335
00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:47.933
<v Speaker 1>self correcting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the thing about free speech is </v>

336
00:18:50.431 --> 00:18:52.770
<v Speaker 1>that like I'm not a free speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>advocate.</v>

337
00:18:52.771 --> 00:18:53.604
<v Speaker 1>Let's say I'm a true speech advocate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that I believe that </v>

338
00:18:57.661 --> 00:19:00.450
<v Speaker 1>people should say what they believe to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be true.</v>

339
00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:03.540
<v Speaker 1>I think that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your obligation.</v>

340
00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.040
<v Speaker 1>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right,</v>

341
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.903
<v Speaker 1>but it comes with an obligation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't believe that true speech as </v>

342
00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:09.564
<v Speaker 1>possible without free speech because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just not very good at thinking </v>

343
00:19:12.841 --> 00:19:13.674
<v Speaker 1>and so you have to stumble around when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're first formulating ideas and </v>

344
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:20.610
<v Speaker 1>wander into territory that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily productive and manifest your</v>

345
00:19:20.611 --> 00:19:21.444
<v Speaker 1>biases and in short you have to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fool and the only way that you you </v>

346
00:19:25.231 --> 00:19:28.080
<v Speaker 1>improve upon that performances by well </v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

347
00:19:28.081 --> 00:19:30.300
<v Speaker 1>stumbling through it to begin with and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then second,</v>

348
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.433
<v Speaker 1>by observing carefully what sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reactions you're getting and having a </v>

349
00:19:34.381 --> 00:19:35.214
<v Speaker 1>dialogue around it so that you can start</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sharpen up your ideas and improve </v>

350
00:19:38.461 --> 00:19:41.910
<v Speaker 1>their focus and find out where you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>made a mistake and all of those things.</v>

351
00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:42.743
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of what's necessary with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to thinking is the freedom to </v>

352
00:19:46.201 --> 00:19:47.034
<v Speaker 1>make mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what are you going to do it </v>

353
00:19:48.751 --> 00:19:50.970
<v Speaker 1>right the first time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

354
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:54.570
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why for Carl Young,</v>

355
00:19:54.571 --> 00:19:57.360
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fool was a mythological precursor to</v>

356
00:19:57.361 --> 00:19:58.350
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the hero,</v>

357
00:19:58.351 --> 00:20:00.720
<v Speaker 1>the tricksters and mythological </v>
<v Speaker 1>precursor to the hero.</v>

358
00:20:00.721 --> 00:20:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Because unless you're willing to stumble</v>
<v Speaker 1>around badly to begin with,</v>

359
00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:04.873
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a fool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you first start doing something </v>

360
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.850
<v Speaker 1>which is always the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're learning something new,</v>

361
00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.090
<v Speaker 1>then you're not gonna make any progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so practically speaking,</v>

362
00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:17.250
<v Speaker 1>free speech has to be as untrammeled as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible so that people can be wrong and</v>

363
00:20:17.251 --> 00:20:19.950
<v Speaker 1>they can be biased and they can still </v>
<v Speaker 1>express their opinions,</v>

364
00:20:19.951 --> 00:20:20.784
<v Speaker 1>including their darker ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then allow themselves to be subject </v>

365
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:26.393
<v Speaker 1>partly to improvement by the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you say things that are too </v>

366
00:20:29.341 --> 00:20:32.100
<v Speaker 1>stupid and then act the mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world smacks you a good one.</v>

367
00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:35.340
<v Speaker 1>But there's also the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>intermediaries,</v>

368
00:20:35.341 --> 00:20:36.174
<v Speaker 1>the other people that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating with who will also do the </v>

369
00:20:37.831 --> 00:20:39.280
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

370
00:20:39.281 --> 00:20:42.690
<v Speaker 1>and we're always broadcasting </v>
<v Speaker 1>information at each other.</v>

371
00:20:42.691 --> 00:20:45.180
<v Speaker 1>Constantly trying to shake each other's </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

372
00:20:45.181 --> 00:20:46.014
<v Speaker 1>And what we're trying to do is to bring </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth from other people that which we </v>

373
00:20:51.011 --> 00:20:55.360
<v Speaker 1>would like to see them manifest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's an implicit ideal as well</v>

374
00:20:55.361 --> 00:20:57.730
<v Speaker 1>that people are broadcasting in each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other all the time.</v>

375
00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:01.570
<v Speaker 1>And there's tremendous social pressure </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>

376
00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:02.643
<v Speaker 1>to manifest that implicit ideal as </v>
<v Speaker 1>closely as possible because otherwise </v>

377
00:21:05.771 --> 00:21:06.604
<v Speaker 1>people disapprove of viewer lack </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest in what you're saying or </v>

378
00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:14.790
<v Speaker 1>criticize you or and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to be allowed to be exposed</v>

379
00:21:15.221 --> 00:21:18.310
<v Speaker 1>to that kind of corrective feedback </v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise you drift and,</v>

380
00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:22.660
<v Speaker 1>and you'll become subject to your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>idiosyncratic insanity.</v>

381
00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:23.421
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

382
00:21:23.421 --> 00:21:26.170
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that very many times in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical practice because,</v>

383
00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:27.041
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

384
00:21:27.041 --> 00:21:30.460
<v Speaker 1>I have some isolated people that come to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see me and all they do is talk.</v>

385
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:31.833
<v Speaker 1>I just listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean because they don't have anyone </v>

386
00:21:33.941 --> 00:21:37.810
<v Speaker 1>else around and they need someone to run</v>
<v Speaker 1>their narrative by,</v>

387
00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:41.140
<v Speaker 1>to keep their minds organized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't do it themselves.</v>

388
00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:45.340
<v Speaker 1>And they can't do it without listening </v>
<v Speaker 1>to themselves talk even because for most</v>

389
00:21:45.341 --> 00:21:47.770
<v Speaker 1>people talking is how they think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

390
00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:50.080
<v Speaker 1>and talking socially is even more how </v>
<v Speaker 1>they think.</v>

391
00:21:50.081 --> 00:21:50.914
<v Speaker 1>And I mean that literally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean that metaphorically is </v>

392
00:21:52.781 --> 00:21:53.614
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's true for almost </v>

393
00:21:54.581 --> 00:21:55.830
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

394
00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:00.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are people who are trained </v>
<v Speaker 1>academically who can actually think.</v>

395
00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:04.120
<v Speaker 1>But to think you have to divide yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>into sub personalities,</v>

396
00:22:04.121 --> 00:22:07.390
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of which has a differing opinion,</v>

397
00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:08.283
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well elucidated differing opinion and </v>

398
00:22:10.061 --> 00:22:10.894
<v Speaker 1>then you have to let those different </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of your personality have an </v>

399
00:22:12.941 --> 00:22:15.700
<v Speaker 1>internal dialogue and you have to draw </v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusions from that.</v>

400
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.160
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult for people to do that and</v>

401
00:22:18.161 --> 00:22:21.040
<v Speaker 1>we radically overestimate the degree to </v>
<v Speaker 1>which they do.</v>

402
00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:22.483
<v Speaker 1>I'm young said at one point that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think so much as thoughts appear </v>

403
00:22:26.741 --> 00:22:27.574
<v Speaker 1>in their head and they believe that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a much more accurate </v>

404
00:22:30.551 --> 00:22:31.384
<v Speaker 1>way of describing the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the general because true thought is not </v>

405
00:22:35.141 --> 00:22:37.270
<v Speaker 1>only that the thoughts arise in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>

406
00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:40.270
<v Speaker 1>it's that you look at the thought and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you critique it,</v>

407
00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.153
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to separate yourself from the </v>

408
00:22:42.071 --> 00:22:43.710
<v Speaker 1>thought and decide whether or not it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

409
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:46.450
<v Speaker 1>it's valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's more like an editing function</v>

410
00:22:46.451 --> 00:22:47.284
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes a long time to be a good </v>

411
00:22:48.521 --> 00:22:49.354
<v Speaker 1>editor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tremendous amount of time and it just </v>

412
00:22:51.221 --> 00:22:55.180
<v Speaker 1>doesn't happen generally speaking so </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

413
00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:58.280
<v Speaker 1>So I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well without free speech there's no true</v>

414
00:22:58.281 --> 00:22:59.560
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

415
00:22:59.561 --> 00:23:00.394
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the hell cares whether or not we </v>

416
00:23:01.721 --> 00:23:04.810
<v Speaker 1>think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the answer to that is fairly</v>

417
00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:05.653
<v Speaker 1>straightforward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean you might think it's so obvious </v>

418
00:23:07.121 --> 00:23:07.954
<v Speaker 1>that it doesn't need explanation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are very few things that are </v>

419
00:23:10.091 --> 00:23:12.070
<v Speaker 1>so obvious they don't need explanation.</v>

420
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:13.263
<v Speaker 1>So the reason you think is so that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world doesn't smack you as hard as it </v>

421
00:23:17.021 --> 00:23:18.560
<v Speaker 1>might fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

422
00:23:18.561 --> 00:23:19.394
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I really mean this technically </v>

423
00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:24.880
<v Speaker 1>because the way that people evolved the </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity to thought for thought was that</v>

424
00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.730
<v Speaker 1>the prefrontal cortex which mediates a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of,</v>

425
00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:30.940
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of voluntary linguistic ability actually</v>

426
00:23:30.941 --> 00:23:34.600
<v Speaker 1>emerged over the course of evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>history out of the motor cortex.</v>

427
00:23:34.601 --> 00:23:38.140
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a very interesting thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand because it means that,</v>

428
00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals basically think by moving.</v>

429
00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.213
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with that is if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think by moving and you make the wrong </v>

430
00:23:44.321 --> 00:23:47.540
<v Speaker 1>move than your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas what human beings can do is they</v>

431
00:23:47.541 --> 00:23:48.374
<v Speaker 1>can generate fictional avatars of </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in fictional worlds and they </v>

432
00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:56.450
<v Speaker 1>can run the avatars as simulations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that get killed,</v>

433
00:23:56.451 --> 00:23:59.090
<v Speaker 1>they don't express in behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

434
00:23:59.150 --> 00:23:59.983
<v Speaker 1>you could do that with words too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although people you know originally </v>

435
00:24:02.181 --> 00:24:03.650
<v Speaker 1>would have done it mostly with images.</v>

436
00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:08.090
<v Speaker 1>They do the same thing with drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the reason that you think,</v>

437
00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:08.953
<v Speaker 1>and I think it was George,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it Alfred North Whitehead that said </v>

438
00:24:12.411 --> 00:24:13.101
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

439
00:24:13.101 --> 00:24:13.934
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not absolutely sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason you think is so that your </v>

440
00:24:16.041 --> 00:24:19.310
<v Speaker 1>thoughts can die instead of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a brilliant,</v>

441
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.233
<v Speaker 1>brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant phrase and absolutely the </v>

442
00:24:22.311 --> 00:24:25.340
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you think properly,</v>

443
00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:29.270
<v Speaker 1>then you kill off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that if you act it out would</v>

444
00:24:29.271 --> 00:24:30.104
<v Speaker 1>kill you or at least cause you suffering</v>
<v Speaker 1>or perhaps caused suffering to the </v>

445
00:24:33.171 --> 00:24:37.010
<v Speaker 1>people around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And since it's more or less obvious,</v>

446
00:24:37.011 --> 00:24:37.844
<v Speaker 1>a priority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that suffering is worse than not </v>

447
00:24:39.381 --> 00:24:41.510
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Under most circumstances.</v>

448
00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:46.010
<v Speaker 1>It seems reasonable to act in a manner </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will minimize it to the degree that</v>

449
00:24:46.011 --> 00:24:46.844
<v Speaker 1>that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you need clarity of thought </v>

450
00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:54.260
<v Speaker 1>because that helps guide you through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>world that's in shrouded in fog and full</v>

451
00:24:54.261 --> 00:24:55.400
<v Speaker 1>of sharp objects.</v>

452
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:59.570
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't want to stumble into </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and impale yourself,</v>

453
00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:03.650
<v Speaker 1>then you should have sharp vision and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sharp capacity to communicate.</v>

454
00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.930
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things I tell students</v>

455
00:25:05.931 --> 00:25:06.764
<v Speaker 1>when I'm trying to teach them to write </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they no one ever tells them why </v>

456
00:25:08.871 --> 00:25:09.704
<v Speaker 1>they should learn to write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you learn to write so you can </v>

457
00:25:11.871 --> 00:25:15.830
<v Speaker 1>think and you learn to think so that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world doesn't treat you any more harshly</v>

458
00:25:15.831 --> 00:25:18.770
<v Speaker 1>than it absolutely has to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's no joke.</v>

459
00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:20.000
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>

460
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.830
<v Speaker 1>if you're a person who's been around a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>

461
00:25:21.831 --> 00:25:26.000
<v Speaker 1>you see very rapidly that people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>sharpen their arguments properly and can</v>

462
00:25:26.001 --> 00:25:29.600
<v Speaker 1>articulate their position and defend it </v>
<v Speaker 1>are always,</v>

463
00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:30.643
<v Speaker 1>always the people who are most </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful and most compelling and that </v>

464
00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.260
<v Speaker 1>and that changed the way structures </v>
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>

465
00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:37.103
<v Speaker 1>And that also helped things continue in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the proper path when they're running </v>

466
00:25:40.461 --> 00:25:41.510
<v Speaker 1>down the proper path.</v>

467
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:42.343
<v Speaker 1>It's no joke to be articulate and to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to think there isn't anything </v>

468
00:25:46.101 --> 00:25:46.934
<v Speaker 1>that's more powerful than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a good segue into the second </v>

469
00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.660
<v Speaker 1>or the third part of what I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to you about.</v>

470
00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:59.380
<v Speaker 1>See</v>
<v Speaker 1>since I made those videos,</v>

471
00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:04.940
<v Speaker 1>I've become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the word is popular on.</v>

472
00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well in many ways,</v>

473
00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:09.530
<v Speaker 1>by about November,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the end of November last year,</v>

474
00:26:09.531 --> 00:26:10.364
<v Speaker 1>there were more than 200 newspaper </v>
<v Speaker 1>articles about the consequences of the </v>

475
00:26:14.151 --> 00:26:14.984
<v Speaker 1>videos that I've produced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those were like in press printed </v>

476
00:26:18.051 --> 00:26:18.884
<v Speaker 1>articles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about anything that </v>

477
00:26:20.571 --> 00:26:23.840
<v Speaker 1>happened on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Youtube is a very strange phenomena.</v>

478
00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.630
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a far more powerful than you think.</v>

479
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:31.580
<v Speaker 1>So just as an aside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on a program last week hosted by a</v>

480
00:26:31.581 --> 00:26:32.414
<v Speaker 1>guy named Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many of you know who </v>

481
00:26:34.131 --> 00:26:36.650
<v Speaker 1>joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan gets one point,</v>

482
00:26:36.651 --> 00:26:39.470
<v Speaker 1>2 billion downloads of his podcast a </v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

483
00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:43.220
<v Speaker 1>You just think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's absolutely unparalleled.</v>

484
00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:44.483
<v Speaker 1>And everybody under 30 years getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>their news from either facebook or from </v>

485
00:26:47.311 --> 00:26:49.650
<v Speaker 1>Youtube and the whole conventional media</v>
<v Speaker 1>sources,</v>

486
00:26:49.651 --> 00:26:52.440
<v Speaker 1>they're dead is there are so dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can hardly believe it.</v>

487
00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:53.813
<v Speaker 1>So Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the reasons I'm bringing it </v>

488
00:26:56.071 --> 00:26:56.904
<v Speaker 1>up is because youtube is the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>platform that's produced for people the </v>

489
00:27:01.411 --> 00:27:02.244
<v Speaker 1>capacity to make the spoken word as far </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaching and permanent as the written </v>

490
00:27:06.991 --> 00:27:08.130
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

491
00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:11.580
<v Speaker 1>That's a complete cultural revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the first time it's ever happened.</v>

492
00:27:11.581 --> 00:27:13.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't have to be youtube,</v>

493
00:27:13.471 --> 00:27:16.770
<v Speaker 1>it just turns out that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>platform that got there first,</v>

494
00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:20.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And anyways,</v>

495
00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:23.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

496
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:25.490
<v Speaker 1>the reason that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

497
00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:28.380
<v Speaker 1>that my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I became popular,</v>

498
00:27:28.381 --> 00:27:29.214
<v Speaker 1>I think was partly because of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the political philosophical videos </v>

499
00:27:33.031 --> 00:27:33.864
<v Speaker 1>that I made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then when people came to my website </v>

500
00:27:35.971 --> 00:27:36.804
<v Speaker 1>to watch them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they stayed generally speaking to watch </v>

501
00:27:39.751 --> 00:27:43.500
<v Speaker 1>the lectures that I had been posting on </v>
<v Speaker 1>there since 2013.</v>

502
00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:44.993
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

503
00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:50.070
<v Speaker 1>those were derived from work I did on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>book called maps of meaning,</v>

504
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:51.143
<v Speaker 1>which I published in 1999.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And see what I was trying to do with </v>

505
00:27:53.851 --> 00:27:57.720
<v Speaker 1>that book was to sort something out that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was very complex.</v>

506
00:27:57.721 --> 00:28:02.580
<v Speaker 1>And that was when I was growing up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Cold War was raging.</v>

507
00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.753
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't understand precisely why we </v>
<v Speaker 1>had divided into two armed camps around </v>

508
00:28:09.061 --> 00:28:09.894
<v Speaker 1>our respective ideological positions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either why those ideological positions </v>

509
00:28:13.681 --> 00:28:14.514
<v Speaker 1>were so important that people would risk</v>
<v Speaker 1>the destruction of the world to protect </v>

510
00:28:17.941 --> 00:28:18.774
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

511
00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:20.063
<v Speaker 1>or why it was those two particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologies or whether or not this was </v>

512
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:25.920
<v Speaker 1>just a difference of opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

513
00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:26.783
<v Speaker 1>Which would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be a more postmodern view is </v>

514
00:28:28.291 --> 00:28:31.350
<v Speaker 1>there's multiple ways that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>organize societies in the west.</v>

515
00:28:31.351 --> 00:28:33.270
<v Speaker 1>We happened to organize our society one </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

516
00:28:33.271 --> 00:28:36.960
<v Speaker 1>but that's one of a plethora of </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential ways of organizing society and</v>

517
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:40.940
<v Speaker 1>let's say the Communists had decided to </v>
<v Speaker 1>organize their society and other way and</v>

518
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:44.610
<v Speaker 1>human beings are infinitely malleable </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you know,</v>

519
00:28:44.611 --> 00:28:45.444
<v Speaker 1>the social structures that we occupy are</v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary in some sense and matter of </v>

520
00:28:50.071 --> 00:28:50.904
<v Speaker 1>opinion and maybe collective opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nonetheless still a matter of </v>

521
00:28:53.611 --> 00:28:54.444
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>

522
00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:55.650
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

523
00:28:55.651 --> 00:28:56.484
<v Speaker 1>is it the case that the values that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>hold to be true in the West are merely </v>

524
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:05.040
<v Speaker 1>based upon opinion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I started to investigate that and</v>

525
00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:11.240
<v Speaker 1>and the conclusion that I came to as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of hitting the question from</v>

526
00:29:11.461 --> 00:29:12.294
<v Speaker 1>multiple different perspectives was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was not a reasonable way of </v>

527
00:29:15.391 --> 00:29:16.860
<v Speaker 1>formulating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

528
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:18.960
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of interpreting the evidence.</v>

529
00:29:18.961 --> 00:29:23.961
<v Speaker 1>And so I looked at neuroscience evidence</v>
<v Speaker 1>from neuropsychology and neuroscience,</v>

530
00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:29.420
<v Speaker 1>mostly mostly</v>
<v Speaker 1>based,</v>

531
00:29:29.611 --> 00:29:31.950
<v Speaker 1>at least in part on the work of someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>named Jeffrey Gray.</v>

532
00:29:31.951 --> 00:29:34.710
<v Speaker 1>It was a very good psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interested in anxiety.</v>

533
00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.310
<v Speaker 1>I looked at general behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology,</v>

534
00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:39.353
<v Speaker 1>looked at literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I looked at mythology and I could </v>

535
00:29:42.911 --> 00:29:45.730
<v Speaker 1>see a pattern emerging across all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

536
00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:46.713
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a nice way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>determining whether or not something </v>

537
00:29:48.311 --> 00:29:49.144
<v Speaker 1>exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's one thing to see a pattern in </v>

538
00:29:50.381 --> 00:29:51.214
<v Speaker 1>one set of data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you can see the same pattern and </v>

539
00:29:53.291 --> 00:29:56.980
<v Speaker 1>another set that's quite historically </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinct from the first and then see the</v>

540
00:29:56.981 --> 00:29:59.440
<v Speaker 1>same pattern in another set and another </v>
<v Speaker 1>set,</v>

541
00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:00.663
<v Speaker 1>then the probability that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>spurious pattern starts to decrease </v>

542
00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:04.534
<v Speaker 1>quite radically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't think the pattern was </v>

543
00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:07.713
<v Speaker 1>spurious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm going to tell you what I </v>

544
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:13.090
<v Speaker 1>think I.</v>

545
00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:15.673
<v Speaker 1>What would you say extracted?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is very complicated and makes a </v>

546
00:30:19.581 --> 00:30:23.810
<v Speaker 1>difficult transition in the talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to read something first.</v>

547
00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:29.700
<v Speaker 1>This is from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the gospel of John.</v>

548
00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:33.030
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most famous lines in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bible.</v>

549
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:38.520
<v Speaker 1>In the beginning was the word and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>word was with God and the word was God.</v>

550
00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:43.350
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange idea because from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmological perspective,</v>

551
00:30:43.351 --> 00:30:44.184
<v Speaker 1>because it pauses that there's something</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm conscious or cognitive about the </v>

552
00:30:48.811 --> 00:30:49.644
<v Speaker 1>origin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a necessary cognitive </v>

553
00:30:52.021 --> 00:30:57.021
<v Speaker 1>element to the origin and I think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that essentially as something associated</v>

554
00:30:57.271 --> 00:31:00.720
<v Speaker 1>with consciousness and of course we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really understand the relationship</v>

555
00:31:00.721 --> 00:31:01.554
<v Speaker 1>between consciousness and being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't understand consciousness at </v>

556
00:31:03.841 --> 00:31:07.170
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems integrally associated,</v>

557
00:31:07.171 --> 00:31:08.004
<v Speaker 1>at least with our individual beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that we seem </v>

558
00:31:10.801 --> 00:31:11.634
<v Speaker 1>to not doubt is that we are in fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious and that so are other people </v>

559
00:31:14.371 --> 00:31:17.010
<v Speaker 1>and if I treat someone as if they're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious,</v>

560
00:31:17.011 --> 00:31:18.990
<v Speaker 1>while they tend not to be very happy </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

561
00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:23.190
<v Speaker 1>So it will certainly object to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So despite what we might say,</v>

562
00:31:23.191 --> 00:31:24.024
<v Speaker 1>we believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we certainly act as if we regard all </v>

563
00:31:26.131 --> 00:31:26.964
<v Speaker 1>other human beings as conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And and the consciousness is a </v>

564
00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:35.190
<v Speaker 1>prerequisite for their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the existence of their experience.</v>

565
00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:39.330
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

566
00:31:39.331 --> 00:31:44.331
<v Speaker 1>so that there's this emphasis in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>book that is at the root of our culture,</v>

567
00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:46.973
<v Speaker 1>that there's something about verbal </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication in particular that has to </v>

568
00:31:51.421 --> 00:31:52.254
<v Speaker 1>be regarded as foundational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's actually to some </v>

569
00:31:55.111 --> 00:31:55.944
<v Speaker 1>degree in keeping with the postmodernist</v>
<v Speaker 1>claims that everything is a language </v>

570
00:31:58.891 --> 00:32:00.750
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that everything is constructed</v>

571
00:32:00.751 --> 00:32:01.471
<v Speaker 1>by language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

572
00:32:01.471 --> 00:32:04.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that everything is </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed by language,</v>

573
00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:09.600
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just pointing that out because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take this particular perspective</v>

574
00:32:09.601 --> 00:32:13.410
<v Speaker 1>and you can look at it from a variety of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different intellectual sources and still</v>

575
00:32:13.411 --> 00:32:16.650
<v Speaker 1>derive an analog of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the claim from it.</v>

576
00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:20.210
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then our so that,</v>

577
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.233
<v Speaker 1>that was so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want you to keep that in the back </v>

578
00:32:23.011 --> 00:32:24.210
<v Speaker 1>of your mind for a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

579
00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:27.900
<v Speaker 1>that idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the word was there at the beginning</v>

580
00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:28.411
<v Speaker 1>of creation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very,</v>

581
00:32:28.411 --> 00:32:29.420
<v Speaker 1>very old idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

582
00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:34.460
<v Speaker 1>it's older than the Judeo Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A context from which I extracted it.</v>

583
00:32:34.861 --> 00:32:37.790
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Egypt there was a god named Patah who</v>

584
00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:38.640
<v Speaker 1>was a major.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

585
00:32:38.641 --> 00:32:39.474
<v Speaker 1>I may be that wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as far as the Egyptians were </v>

586
00:32:41.841 --> 00:32:42.674
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was the original creator and he </v>

587
00:32:44.211 --> 00:32:45.044
<v Speaker 1>created as a consequence of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more specifically as a consequence </v>

588
00:32:47.851 --> 00:32:49.370
<v Speaker 1>of speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>

589
00:32:49.371 --> 00:32:53.270
<v Speaker 1>there was this idea that there was this </v>
<v Speaker 1>primacy of speaking as a,</v>

590
00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.193
<v Speaker 1>as a force that brings being into </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence and then you see the same </v>

591
00:32:57.141 --> 00:33:00.470
<v Speaker 1>thing in the Mesopotamian context to </v>
<v Speaker 1>their creation.</v>

592
00:33:00.471 --> 00:33:01.304
<v Speaker 1>Myth was called the Enuma elish and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a god in that story and that </v>

593
00:33:06.501 --> 00:33:07.334
<v Speaker 1>story apparently is one of the places </v>
<v Speaker 1>from which the creation story in the in </v>

594
00:33:10.701 --> 00:33:11.534
<v Speaker 1>the Bible was extracted that God is </v>
<v Speaker 1>named Martin and Martin is a god that </v>

595
00:33:17.361 --> 00:33:20.480
<v Speaker 1>fights chaos and creates the world out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the consequences.</v>

596
00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:21.613
<v Speaker 1>And He.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a variety of different </v>

597
00:33:22.791 --> 00:33:23.624
<v Speaker 1>attributes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of which is head is ringed with </v>

598
00:33:25.221 --> 00:33:26.930
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we can see in all directions.</v>

599
00:33:26.931 --> 00:33:27.764
<v Speaker 1>So there's very much emphasis among the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamians on the primacy of </v>

600
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:32.300
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

601
00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:33.283
<v Speaker 1>But he can also speak magic words and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the fact that he's equipped with </v>

602
00:33:36.411 --> 00:33:37.244
<v Speaker 1>this massive capacity for attention and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to speak magic words that </v>

603
00:33:40.011 --> 00:33:43.220
<v Speaker 1>enables him to go and fight the dragon </v>
<v Speaker 1>of chaos,</v>

604
00:33:43.221 --> 00:33:46.130
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking into cutter into pieces</v>
<v Speaker 1>and make up the world.</v>

605
00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:48.200
<v Speaker 1>One of [inaudible] names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

606
00:33:48.201 --> 00:33:49.034
<v Speaker 1>is he who makes ingenious things out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the combat with ty Matt and time at is </v>

607
00:33:53.541 --> 00:33:58.541
<v Speaker 1>this got primordial goddess of chaos </v>
<v Speaker 1>that represents the sort of the formless</v>

608
00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:03.140
<v Speaker 1>prodo matter of things from which </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness extract structure.</v>

609
00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:07.730
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that idea is quite widespread.</v>

610
00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:09.260
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

611
00:34:09.261 --> 00:34:10.094
<v Speaker 1>it's an idea that informs mythological </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures everywhere as far as I can </v>

612
00:34:12.951 --> 00:34:13.610
<v Speaker 1>tell.</v>

613
00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:18.610
<v Speaker 1>There's this idea that there's a dynamic</v>
<v Speaker 1>between what you know and what you don't</v>

614
00:34:20.091 --> 00:34:20.924
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think about those as different </v>

615
00:34:21.741 --> 00:34:24.200
<v Speaker 1>domains of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you know and what you don't know,</v>

616
00:34:24.201 --> 00:34:27.950
<v Speaker 1>and the thing that mediates between what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know and what you don't know is this</v>

617
00:34:27.951 --> 00:34:31.430
<v Speaker 1>thing that has the attribute of have </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken wisdom.</v>

618
00:34:31.431 --> 00:34:33.380
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's,</v>

619
00:34:33.410 --> 00:34:35.450
<v Speaker 1>here's a way that's a very complicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

620
00:34:35.451 --> 00:34:36.284
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's extraordinarily difficult to </v>

621
00:34:38.661 --> 00:34:40.040
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

622
00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:44.630
<v Speaker 1>I can give you some sense of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a phenomenal logical idea.</v>

623
00:34:44.631 --> 00:34:46.910
<v Speaker 1>I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that you are,</v>

624
00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:49.250
<v Speaker 1>that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

625
00:34:49.251 --> 00:34:51.150
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

626
00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're a medical student,</v>

627
00:34:52.891 --> 00:34:54.560
<v Speaker 1>a medical premed students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

628
00:34:54.561 --> 00:34:55.394
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to go to medical school?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're easily beating away on </v>

629
00:34:58.311 --> 00:34:59.460
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your courses.</v>

630
00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:00.620
<v Speaker 1>You're doing all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

631
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:04.730
<v Speaker 1>then you go take them cat and you score </v>
<v Speaker 1>it the say 20th percentile,</v>

632
00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.850
<v Speaker 1>which of course 20 percent of people do.</v>

633
00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:12.170
<v Speaker 1>And that will come as quite a shock to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

634
00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.093
<v Speaker 1>no doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you go in there in the world </v>

635
00:35:15.291 --> 00:35:18.860
<v Speaker 1>that you understand and in that world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your competence,</v>

636
00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:19.723
<v Speaker 1>let's say to become a medical doctor and</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you open the envelope and you look </v>

637
00:35:23.781 --> 00:35:24.614
<v Speaker 1>at the number then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then your world crumbles and </v>

638
00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:28.124
<v Speaker 1>collapses and collapses into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say is equivalent to this </v>

639
00:35:31.551 --> 00:35:35.700
<v Speaker 1>formless chaos that the ancients </v>
<v Speaker 1>believed was the ground of being.</v>

640
00:35:35.701 --> 00:35:38.400
<v Speaker 1>And it's this place where reigns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

641
00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:39.473
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word for the chaos that God orders </v>

642
00:35:41.701 --> 00:35:42.534
<v Speaker 1>with the word at the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>genesis is often translated as chaos or </v>

643
00:35:46.411 --> 00:35:48.600
<v Speaker 1>confusion now and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

644
00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:49.673
<v Speaker 1>you've formulated a world that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabit with a particular linguistic </v>

645
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:54.360
<v Speaker 1>rational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>logical structure.</v>

646
00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:55.373
<v Speaker 1>It's predicated on certain axioms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief like that you're competent to be </v>

647
00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:04.070
<v Speaker 1>a medical doctor and then you receive a </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of information that makes not only</v>

648
00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:09.480
<v Speaker 1>your present understanding of yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no longer relevant or correct,</v>

649
00:36:09.481 --> 00:36:10.314
<v Speaker 1>but also your past understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and also your future who've </v>

650
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:20.510
<v Speaker 1>gone right or gone were gone into what </v>
<v Speaker 1>well gone into chaos roughly speaking,</v>

651
00:36:22.711 --> 00:36:25.800
<v Speaker 1>and then you're in very rough shape as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that,</v>

652
00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:26.873
<v Speaker 1>and if you do manage to lever yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of that chaotic condition that you </v>

653
00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:30.843
<v Speaker 1>now find yourself in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to essentially do it with </v>

654
00:36:32.941 --> 00:36:34.770
<v Speaker 1>thought and dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

655
00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Because you're going to talk to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did I do wrong?</v>

656
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:37.823
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with the way I thought?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could I have been so misled by what </v>

657
00:36:40.831 --> 00:36:42.780
<v Speaker 1>I believe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What should I do now?</v>

658
00:36:42.781 --> 00:36:43.614
<v Speaker 1>Who actually am I?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of that is a way of reconstructing </v>

659
00:36:46.681 --> 00:36:49.320
<v Speaker 1>yourself from the ashes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

660
00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:51.630
<v Speaker 1>I would say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you do that with,</v>

661
00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:52.650
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

662
00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:53.483
<v Speaker 1>with speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you do that with true speech and so </v>

663
00:36:56.311 --> 00:36:57.480
<v Speaker 1>true speeches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

664
00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:02.850
<v Speaker 1>what redeemed you from the chaos of </v>
<v Speaker 1>unstructured being and so,</v>

665
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:03.743
<v Speaker 1>so then that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing to think about for </v>

666
00:37:05.071 --> 00:37:09.750
<v Speaker 1>a moment and then I'm going to bring up </v>
<v Speaker 1>this final piece and</v>

667
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:16.670
<v Speaker 1>we can think about it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

668
00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:28.440
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to figure out how these</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas came to be because they came to be</v>

669
00:37:28.441 --> 00:37:31.770
<v Speaker 1>over a very long period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the God Marduk for example,</v>

670
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:33.143
<v Speaker 1>he was assembled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say as the empires of the </v>

671
00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:37.853
<v Speaker 1>ancient Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the tribal people of the ancient </v>

672
00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:41.183
<v Speaker 1>Middle East came together and they each </v>
<v Speaker 1>had their own daddies that represented </v>

673
00:37:44.251 --> 00:37:45.084
<v Speaker 1>their highest values and when they came </v>
<v Speaker 1>together those deities had to be </v>

674
00:37:47.161 --> 00:37:47.994
<v Speaker 1>amalgamated and so try bay has its </v>
<v Speaker 1>highest value and try B has its highest </v>

675
00:37:52.771 --> 00:37:53.604
<v Speaker 1>value in their embodied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the day of the element and they </v>

676
00:37:55.741 --> 00:37:56.574
<v Speaker 1>come together and then the day at east </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense have to have a war to </v>

677
00:37:59.371 --> 00:38:04.371
<v Speaker 1>figure out who's the top God and so if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you assemble a few hundred tribes out of</v>

678
00:38:04.681 --> 00:38:08.270
<v Speaker 1>that comes a conceptualization of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>top God that was Marduk,</v>

679
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.113
<v Speaker 1>for example in Mesopotamia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he usually absorbs the names of all </v>

680
00:38:12.661 --> 00:38:16.560
<v Speaker 1>the previous gods as he sort of emerged </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the king of a hierarchy.</v>

681
00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:20.310
<v Speaker 1>And so so you think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think about the expression of the</v>

682
00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:24.120
<v Speaker 1>daddy as the projection of the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal of the tribe,</v>

683
00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:25.443
<v Speaker 1>and that's something that's been worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>out over perhaps millennia and </v>

684
00:38:28.381 --> 00:38:29.214
<v Speaker 1>especially with people who have an oral </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition and then you bring those </v>

685
00:38:31.201 --> 00:38:32.034
<v Speaker 1>different tribes together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is the highest ideals in </v>

686
00:38:34.231 --> 00:38:38.260
<v Speaker 1>their embodied form have what you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of metaphorically as a war,</v>

687
00:38:38.261 --> 00:38:40.150
<v Speaker 1>and the war of God's in heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

688
00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:43.780
<v Speaker 1>is a very ancient and widespread </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological motif.</v>

689
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:47.830
<v Speaker 1>And out of that war arises what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might describe as a matter of value.</v>

690
00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:53.320
<v Speaker 1>And so the metta value would be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>highest value among a set of values.</v>

691
00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:54.670
<v Speaker 1>And the question would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

692
00:38:54.671 --> 00:38:57.070
<v Speaker 1>what would that value be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would that highest fail you be?</v>

693
00:38:57.071 --> 00:38:57.904
<v Speaker 1>Is there something about it that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's recognizable and say somewhat </v>

694
00:39:00.671 --> 00:39:01.504
<v Speaker 1>constant so that if you took 100 tribes </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and amalgamated their ideals and </v>

695
00:39:04.991 --> 00:39:07.420
<v Speaker 1>you took 100 tribes here at amalgamated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their ideals,</v>

696
00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:08.493
<v Speaker 1>if the two sets of amalgamations would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a structural similarity to one </v>

697
00:39:11.561 --> 00:39:12.310
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

698
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:14.680
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I can tell the answer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is yes.</v>

699
00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:15.723
<v Speaker 1>And it's a logical answer because you'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>expect structural similarity if you </v>

700
00:39:18.401 --> 00:39:20.400
<v Speaker 1>extract out a common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

701
00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:25.340
<v Speaker 1>a common element from a very large </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of constituent representatives.</v>

702
00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:28.000
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take a,</v>

703
00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:31.390
<v Speaker 1>a large number of female faces and </v>
<v Speaker 1>average them.</v>

704
00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:33.340
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not talking about the average </v>
<v Speaker 1>face,</v>

705
00:39:33.341 --> 00:39:36.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about the averaged face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same thing.</v>

706
00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:42.060
<v Speaker 1>The averaged female face is attractive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so is the average male face.</v>

707
00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:43.533
<v Speaker 1>And so because it kind of constitutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>the central human form and if you take </v>

708
00:39:46.481 --> 00:39:51.481
<v Speaker 1>64 women and you extract out an average </v>
<v Speaker 1>face and you take another 64,</v>

709
00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:55.420
<v Speaker 1>you get the same face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe it takes more than 64,</v>

710
00:39:55.421 --> 00:39:57.460
<v Speaker 1>but you get the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>

711
00:39:58.450 --> 00:39:59.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was,</v>

712
00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:02.350
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about how that process </v>
<v Speaker 1>came to be.</v>

713
00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:05.283
<v Speaker 1>I decided to look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even like to go back farther in time to </v>

714
00:40:08.861 --> 00:40:13.861
<v Speaker 1>try to understand how it is that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulated our values per se.</v>

715
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:18.850
<v Speaker 1>And especially given that at some point </v>
<v Speaker 1>we weren't linguistic creatures at all.</v>

716
00:40:18.851 --> 00:40:19.684
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We separated from the common ancestors </v>

717
00:40:21.521 --> 00:40:24.600
<v Speaker 1>between us and chimpanzees about 6 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million years ago.</v>

718
00:40:24.601 --> 00:40:29.110
<v Speaker 1>And sometime during that 6 million year </v>
<v Speaker 1>process we started to be able to imitate</v>

719
00:40:29.111 --> 00:40:33.730
<v Speaker 1>ourselves first and then represent </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves in image and action.</v>

720
00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:37.280
<v Speaker 1>And then only after that to start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate ourselves.</v>

721
00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:42.300
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of the knowledge that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have is grounded in our embodiment,</v>

722
00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.233
<v Speaker 1>but also in the shaping of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>embodiment across extraordinary long </v>

723
00:40:46.841 --> 00:40:51.160
<v Speaker 1>periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like there's an implicit way of being</v>

724
00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:53.580
<v Speaker 1>in your form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your embodied form,</v>

725
00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:54.423
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an implicit way of being that's </v>

726
00:40:56.891 --> 00:40:57.724
<v Speaker 1>a consequence of the fact that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>existed within hierarchical social </v>

727
00:41:02.561 --> 00:41:07.561
<v Speaker 1>structures for far longer than we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>even sharing a common ancestors say with</v>

728
00:41:08.471 --> 00:41:09.070
<v Speaker 1>great apes.</v>

729
00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:09.903
<v Speaker 1>So that's for maybe hundreds of millions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of years with regards to being embedded </v>

730
00:41:13.451 --> 00:41:17.050
<v Speaker 1>in a hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the question is something like,</v>

731
00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:18.843
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for embedded in a hierarchy and we have </v>

732
00:41:20.471 --> 00:41:23.590
<v Speaker 1>been forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's about $350 million years,</v>

733
00:41:23.591 --> 00:41:24.424
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a set of attributes that tends </v>

734
00:41:26.681 --> 00:41:30.250
<v Speaker 1>reliably to move you up the hierarchy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if there is,</v>

735
00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:31.103
<v Speaker 1>you see being going up the hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 1>increases the probability of </v>

736
00:41:34.131 --> 00:41:34.964
<v Speaker 1>reproductive success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's actually nothing more </v>

737
00:41:37.401 --> 00:41:38.234
<v Speaker 1>important to determine over the course </v>
<v Speaker 1>of $350 million years inside a </v>

738
00:41:42.021 --> 00:41:45.080
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then how it is that you ratchet yourself</v>

739
00:41:45.081 --> 00:41:45.914
<v Speaker 1>up the hierarchy reliably and you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about that in some sense as the </v>

740
00:41:49.551 --> 00:41:50.384
<v Speaker 1>source of ideals here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a kind of a concrete way of </v>

741
00:41:53.901 --> 00:41:55.350
<v Speaker 1>thinking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

742
00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:58.580
<v Speaker 1>if you get 100 men together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to,</v>

743
00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:02.630
<v Speaker 1>they're going to organize themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a hierarchical structure.</v>

744
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:05.600
<v Speaker 1>They have to or they're gonna stay </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaotic and fight that.</v>

745
00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:10.510
<v Speaker 1>That's the other alternative and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the the way that that,</v>

746
00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:12.890
<v Speaker 1>that the people who are going to rise to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top,</v>

747
00:42:12.891 --> 00:42:17.210
<v Speaker 1>they might rise to the top because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their sheer physical prowess and power,</v>

748
00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:18.403
<v Speaker 1>but they also might rise to the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're very competent at </v>

749
00:42:20.661 --> 00:42:21.494
<v Speaker 1>certain things and it's as if all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>men are going to get together and vote </v>

750
00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:25.573
<v Speaker 1>and maybe that would actually happen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>determine who best embodies the spirit </v>

751
00:42:29.781 --> 00:42:30.614
<v Speaker 1>of the group and who should be granted </v>
<v Speaker 1>leadership and in an evolutionary </v>

752
00:42:32.931 --> 00:42:33.860
<v Speaker 1>context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

753
00:42:33.861 --> 00:42:34.694
<v Speaker 1>that would also help ensure that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>person would propagate their genes into </v>

754
00:42:38.331 --> 00:42:41.150
<v Speaker 1>the next generation and it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>trivial effect,</v>

755
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:42.343
<v Speaker 1>especially among men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big effect because roughly </v>

756
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:48.560
<v Speaker 1>speaking half half of all manner or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>reproductively successful,</v>

757
00:42:48.561 --> 00:42:50.750
<v Speaker 1>so there's a wicked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a wicked,</v>

758
00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:53.270
<v Speaker 1>a calling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say among men.</v>

759
00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:54.973
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see this among chimpanzees as </v>

760
00:42:56.031 --> 00:42:56.660
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

761
00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:57.493
<v Speaker 1>They have dominance hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some sort of chimps rise to the top and </v>

762
00:43:00.831 --> 00:43:01.491
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

763
00:43:01.491 --> 00:43:04.550
<v Speaker 1>that's the like caveman chimp who's best</v>
<v Speaker 1>at pounding out all the,</v>

764
00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:07.310
<v Speaker 1>all the rivals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it turns out that that's not exactly</v>

765
00:43:07.311 --> 00:43:11.420
<v Speaker 1>the case in France to wall has done a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very good job of detailing this with his</v>

766
00:43:11.421 --> 00:43:16.421
<v Speaker 1>work on chimpanzees in particular and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's found that the power hungry tyrants</v>

767
00:43:16.551 --> 00:43:17.384
<v Speaker 1>sort of chimp can rule for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he tends to have a very unstable </v>

768
00:43:21.111 --> 00:43:21.944
<v Speaker 1>kingdom and the reason for that is is </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not very good at mutually grooming </v>

769
00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:26.383
<v Speaker 1>is not good at socially connecting with </v>
<v Speaker 1>other males and he isn't popular among </v>

770
00:43:30.021 --> 00:43:33.770
<v Speaker 1>the females and doesn't attend to the to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the young essentially.</v>

771
00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:36.350
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is even if he's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meanest,</v>

772
00:43:36.351 --> 00:43:39.830
<v Speaker 1>toughest guy on the block to subordinate</v>
<v Speaker 1>chimps,</v>

773
00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:41.570
<v Speaker 1>team up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make friends.</v>

774
00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:42.523
<v Speaker 1>They groom each other and they have each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other's backs and in a one day he's </v>

775
00:43:44.931 --> 00:43:45.764
<v Speaker 1>having an off day because he ate too </v>
<v Speaker 1>many fermented bananas the night before </v>

776
00:43:48.261 --> 00:43:49.094
<v Speaker 1>and like they just tear them into pieces</v>
<v Speaker 1>and chimps are unbelievably strong and </v>

777
00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:54.320
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably brutal.</v>

778
00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:55.483
<v Speaker 1>They seem to have absolutely no internal</v>
<v Speaker 1>regulation whatsoever of the regression </v>

779
00:43:59.961 --> 00:44:03.710
<v Speaker 1>that all seems to be manifested outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of dominance,</v>

780
00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:04.553
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we know that because they go on </v>

781
00:44:06.201 --> 00:44:07.034
<v Speaker 1>raiding parties into other chimp </v>
<v Speaker 1>territories and when they find chimps </v>

782
00:44:09.291 --> 00:44:13.280
<v Speaker 1>that aren't part of their hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just rip them into pieces.</v>

783
00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:14.533
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a scary thing if you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about our similarity with chimpanzees </v>

784
00:44:18.051 --> 00:44:21.080
<v Speaker 1>because we like to think we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>internal controls over our aggression,</v>

785
00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:23.750
<v Speaker 1>but it's not so bloody obvious I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you that.</v>

786
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:27.170
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What duwall found was that it's actually</v>

787
00:44:27.171 --> 00:44:28.990
<v Speaker 1>chimps that are more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

788
00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:32.490
<v Speaker 1>you might say humane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although Champaign,</v>

789
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:37.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the equivalent it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say humane that managed to produce</v>

790
00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:41.760
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies that are more stable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually managed to stay alive on top of</v>

791
00:44:41.761 --> 00:44:42.594
<v Speaker 1>them for much longer periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he thinks about that as the </v>

792
00:44:45.211 --> 00:44:47.730
<v Speaker 1>emergence of an implicit morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

793
00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:50.370
<v Speaker 1>So morality that's acted out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you think,</v>

794
00:44:50.371 --> 00:44:51.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

795
00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:53.580
<v Speaker 1>there are different ways of climbing up </v>
<v Speaker 1>a hierarchy.</v>

796
00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:57.450
<v Speaker 1>There are worse and better ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The better ways allow you to live longer</v>

797
00:44:57.451 --> 00:45:00.960
<v Speaker 1>in a more stable hierarchy and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary payoff for that is that you</v>

798
00:45:00.961 --> 00:45:01.794
<v Speaker 1>leave more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more descendants and so the hierarchy </v>

799
00:45:05.311 --> 00:45:09.930
<v Speaker 1>itself becomes a very powerful shaping </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanism that determines how it is that</v>

800
00:45:09.931 --> 00:45:13.650
<v Speaker 1>people are going to adapt because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the primary method of selection,</v>

801
00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:14.813
<v Speaker 1>so there's an ethic in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an ethic that emerges from the </v>

802
00:45:17.131 --> 00:45:17.964
<v Speaker 1>social interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's rapidly transformed into a </v>

803
00:45:20.161 --> 00:45:20.994
<v Speaker 1>biological selection device and so were </v>
<v Speaker 1>selected and that's especially true </v>

804
00:45:25.111 --> 00:45:30.111
<v Speaker 1>among human beings because with chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the females are indiscriminant maters,</v>

805
00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:36.180
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that a female champion </v>
<v Speaker 1>heat will meet with any mail chimp.</v>

806
00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:37.733
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this dominant males chase the </v>

807
00:45:39.661 --> 00:45:40.494
<v Speaker 1>subordinate males away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's still more likely to leave </v>

808
00:45:42.421 --> 00:45:45.360
<v Speaker 1>offspring than the subordinates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not because of the females,</v>

809
00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:47.130
<v Speaker 1>but human females are different.</v>

810
00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Human females exert choice and quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>brutal choice.</v>

811
00:45:52.111 --> 00:45:52.944
<v Speaker 1>You might put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very choosy and it's one of the </v>

812
00:45:55.051 --> 00:45:55.884
<v Speaker 1>things that seems to have distinguished </v>
<v Speaker 1>us from chimpanzees and what roughly </v>

813
00:45:58.981 --> 00:45:59.814
<v Speaker 1>seems to happen is that the male </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy elects men to the </v>

814
00:46:03.361 --> 00:46:07.800
<v Speaker 1>higher say rungs of the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the females peel from the top,</v>

815
00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:12.240
<v Speaker 1>and so that means that what you can say </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that human beings are the consequence</v>

816
00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:14.820
<v Speaker 1>of intense male dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

817
00:46:15.310 --> 00:46:18.450
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's competition for the upper rungs</v>

818
00:46:18.451 --> 00:46:21.240
<v Speaker 1>of the hierarchy mediated by female </v>
<v Speaker 1>selection.</v>

819
00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:24.240
<v Speaker 1>And so that's produced as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell,</v>

820
00:46:24.241 --> 00:46:27.300
<v Speaker 1>a powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a powerful pattern of behavior.</v>

821
00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Now the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that pattern of behavior?</v>

822
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:31.950
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

823
00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:37.140
<v Speaker 1>it's encapsulated in mythology in two </v>
<v Speaker 1>forms and the question is,</v>

824
00:46:37.141 --> 00:46:38.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who should lead?</v>

825
00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that's the question.</v>

826
00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:41.580
<v Speaker 1>Who should lead?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the question,</v>

827
00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:45.990
<v Speaker 1>who should be sovereign or maybe when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes abstracted,</v>

828
00:46:45.991 --> 00:46:46.824
<v Speaker 1>what should be sovereign?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the first question from an </v>

829
00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:52.260
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary perspective is who should </v>
<v Speaker 1>be sovereign?</v>

830
00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:57.480
<v Speaker 1>But once you could abstract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the principle of sovereignty can be</v>

831
00:46:57.481 --> 00:46:58.314
<v Speaker 1>detached from the leader and become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>principal all on its own and that might </v>

832
00:47:02.221 --> 00:47:06.730
<v Speaker 1>be first expressed in mythological or </v>
<v Speaker 1>images stick form dramatic form like the</v>

833
00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:09.900
<v Speaker 1>the good guys versus the bad guys are </v>
<v Speaker 1>good versus evil.</v>

834
00:47:09.901 --> 00:47:10.734
<v Speaker 1>We could say it like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but obviously it's embodied and acted </v>

835
00:47:13.621 --> 00:47:14.454
<v Speaker 1>out far before it's extracted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And turned into an abstract </v>

836
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:19.740
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would seems to have happened is,</v>

837
00:47:20.090 --> 00:47:23.730
<v Speaker 1>so one of the common themes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example in mythology,</v>

838
00:47:23.731 --> 00:47:26.250
<v Speaker 1>is what's roughly been described as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hero myth.</v>

839
00:47:26.251 --> 00:47:29.790
<v Speaker 1>And a hero myth involves someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of a,</v>

840
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:30.873
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>demolished community community under </v>

841
00:47:32.711 --> 00:47:33.400
<v Speaker 1>threat.</v>

842
00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:36.670
<v Speaker 1>The threat's usually signified by </v>
<v Speaker 1>something vaguely like a dragon,</v>

843
00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:39.370
<v Speaker 1>and the dragon comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's eternal.</v>

844
00:47:39.371 --> 00:47:40.204
<v Speaker 1>It comes out to attack the village.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hero comes out and confronts the </v>

845
00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.730
<v Speaker 1>Dragon and then freeze the virgin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

846
00:47:45.731 --> 00:47:47.830
<v Speaker 1>or gets the gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to me,</v>

847
00:47:47.831 --> 00:47:48.850
<v Speaker 1>that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very well.</v>

848
00:47:48.851 --> 00:47:51.790
<v Speaker 1>That is a very old story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in the Enuma elish for example.</v>

849
00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:55.030
<v Speaker 1>It's the story at the basis of very </v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

850
00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:59.410
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Widely dispersed myths around the world.</v>

851
00:47:59.411 --> 00:48:00.330
<v Speaker 1>The Dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

852
00:48:00.331 --> 00:48:01.164
<v Speaker 1>is a very common symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason for that is it's </v>

853
00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:04.353
<v Speaker 1>so complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think the reason for that is </v>

854
00:48:05.501 --> 00:48:10.501
<v Speaker 1>something like this is that human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>learned to understand over time that the</v>

855
00:48:11.681 --> 00:48:16.330
<v Speaker 1>most reliable leader was the person who </v>
<v Speaker 1>could step outside the structure when it</v>

856
00:48:16.331 --> 00:48:17.164
<v Speaker 1>was damaged to confront something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was chaotic and dangerous in whatever </v>

857
00:48:20.411 --> 00:48:21.244
<v Speaker 1>form that might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then to bring something valuable </v>

858
00:48:23.111 --> 00:48:23.944
<v Speaker 1>back as a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you see that principle being </v>

859
00:48:26.261 --> 00:48:27.094
<v Speaker 1>elevated continually and mythological </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories like the Enuma elish for </v>

860
00:48:29.651 --> 00:48:30.484
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the main hero Marduk is elevated </v>

861
00:48:32.531 --> 00:48:33.364
<v Speaker 1>among the other gods and is </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized by this intense capacity </v>

862
00:48:36.131 --> 00:48:36.964
<v Speaker 1>for vision which the Greek which the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Egyptians also worshiped in the form of </v>

863
00:48:40.571 --> 00:48:45.090
<v Speaker 1>horace and this capacity to speak which </v>
<v Speaker 1>has this ability to,</v>

864
00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:47.890
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to formulate and reshape the world.</v>

865
00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:52.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing is that it's as if what</v>

866
00:48:52.451 --> 00:48:55.040
<v Speaker 1>we've discovered as a species in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>senses,</v>

867
00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:55.893
<v Speaker 1>that there's the the person that should </v>
<v Speaker 1>lead the thing that should be sovereign </v>

868
00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:05.680
<v Speaker 1>is the thing that can step outside the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structured order,</v>

869
00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:07.023
<v Speaker 1>incorporate something new and dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then produce something valuable out </v>

870
00:49:10.181 --> 00:49:12.600
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one phase.</v>

871
00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Another phase is another hero myth is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the person who who,</v>

872
00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:17.643
<v Speaker 1>who criticizes the power elite when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes corrupt and points out the </v>

873
00:49:22.031 --> 00:49:22.864
<v Speaker 1>corruption and then restructures the </v>
<v Speaker 1>society that happens in the prophetic </v>

874
00:49:25.451 --> 00:49:26.320
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

875
00:49:26.321 --> 00:49:27.154
<v Speaker 1>continually in the Old Testament because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could think that the historical </v>

876
00:49:30.101 --> 00:49:34.150
<v Speaker 1>enemies of humanity are twofold in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

877
00:49:34.151 --> 00:49:38.580
<v Speaker 1>One is the chaos that comes from outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that disrupts the standard order and</v>

878
00:49:38.581 --> 00:49:39.414
<v Speaker 1>that needs to be dealt with and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other is the chaos that comes in the </v>

879
00:49:42.191 --> 00:49:46.000
<v Speaker 1>inside when when our institutions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies become corrupt,</v>

880
00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:47.223
<v Speaker 1>and then the thing that transforms that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the thing that has enough courage </v>

881
00:49:50.411 --> 00:49:51.244
<v Speaker 1>either to stand up against the chaos or </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say something about the corrupt </v>

882
00:49:54.431 --> 00:49:59.000
<v Speaker 1>institutions and what's happened as far </v>
<v Speaker 1>as I can tell is that over time,</v>

883
00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.033
<v Speaker 1>those principles have been extracted out</v>
<v Speaker 1>from this much more embodied domain and </v>

884
00:50:04.961 --> 00:50:07.480
<v Speaker 1>raise to the principle of highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty.</v>

885
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:09.790
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that happened in Egypt</v>

886
00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:14.770
<v Speaker 1>with called the dimock democratization </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Osiris and horus.</v>

887
00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:19.773
<v Speaker 1>What seems to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is this is what happened in </v>

888
00:50:21.341 --> 00:50:22.174
<v Speaker 1>Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the power to manifest that </v>

889
00:50:25.061 --> 00:50:25.894
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say is first only regarded as an </v>

890
00:50:29.991 --> 00:50:30.824
<v Speaker 1>attribute of the sovereign like and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>king is actually only king in so far as </v>

891
00:50:34.911 --> 00:50:37.370
<v Speaker 1>he could manifest that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in Mesopotamia,</v>

892
00:50:37.371 --> 00:50:39.500
<v Speaker 1>you're only emperor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were a good Marduk,</v>

893
00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:44.000
<v Speaker 1>you'd go out on New Year's day and </v>
<v Speaker 1>reenact the entire cosmogony and you had</v>

894
00:50:44.001 --> 00:50:44.834
<v Speaker 1>to be a good representative of Martech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you didn't deserve your </v>

895
00:50:47.151 --> 00:50:51.080
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty and in Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you were a good Avatar,</v>

896
00:50:51.081 --> 00:50:53.630
<v Speaker 1>let's say of Horus and Osiris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the combination,</v>

897
00:50:53.631 --> 00:50:57.620
<v Speaker 1>then you didn't get to be feral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you are embodying this principle,</v>

898
00:50:57.621 --> 00:50:58.454
<v Speaker 1>this principle of sovereignty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what happened in Egypt was that </v>

899
00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:04.010
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the principle of sovereignty,</v>

900
00:51:04.011 --> 00:51:04.844
<v Speaker 1>the images of sovereignty could only be </v>
<v Speaker 1>used by the Pharaoh and then it became </v>

901
00:51:07.881 --> 00:51:11.210
<v Speaker 1>the aristocracy and then what seemed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen after that.</v>

902
00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:13.880
<v Speaker 1>They were using the symbols.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What seemed to happen after that,</v>

903
00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:19.130
<v Speaker 1>this was maybe a transmutation and part </v>
<v Speaker 1>via the Greeks and impart via the Jews,</v>

904
00:51:19.131 --> 00:51:19.964
<v Speaker 1>is that the idea that that sovereignty </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was inherent in the Pharaoh and </v>

905
00:51:24.951 --> 00:51:25.784
<v Speaker 1>then in the aristocracy was actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that could be attributed to </v>

906
00:51:28.131 --> 00:51:28.964
<v Speaker 1>everyone that was human and that was I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that that that manifested itself </v>

907
00:51:34.311 --> 00:51:35.144
<v Speaker 1>most completely in some sense at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the Christian era because </v>

908
00:51:37.851 --> 00:51:38.684
<v Speaker 1>there was an emphasis then on the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that every single individual carried </v>

909
00:51:42.051 --> 00:51:44.960
<v Speaker 1>within them a spark of the divine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

910
00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:48.080
<v Speaker 1>and that was the proper source of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty,</v>

911
00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:49.580
<v Speaker 1>and so then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

912
00:51:49.581 --> 00:51:50.414
<v Speaker 1>what is that source of the divine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I read you that section </v>

913
00:51:52.911 --> 00:51:53.744
<v Speaker 1>from John to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the source of the divinity is </v>

914
00:51:56.901 --> 00:52:01.901
<v Speaker 1>the capacity to speak and transmute the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world as a consequence of speaking.</v>

915
00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:04.610
<v Speaker 1>And that's the proper principle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty.</v>

916
00:52:04.611 --> 00:52:05.444
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also the reason why in the west </v>

917
00:52:07.731 --> 00:52:10.310
<v Speaker 1>people have an inviolable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

918
00:52:10.850 --> 00:52:11.683
<v Speaker 1>The reason they have an inviolable right</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because our society figured out and </v>

919
00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:17.450
<v Speaker 1>based on these unbelievably deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>antecedents,</v>

920
00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:21.590
<v Speaker 1>print precedents that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

921
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:24.343
<v Speaker 1>each individual had the capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>contribute something to the group </v>

922
00:52:27.111 --> 00:52:30.650
<v Speaker 1>without which the group would be less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

923
00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:31.813
<v Speaker 1>And so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're regarded at the base of our law </v>

924
00:52:34.371 --> 00:52:35.790
<v Speaker 1>as the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

925
00:52:36.490 --> 00:52:38.420
<v Speaker 1>as the Avatar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>

926
00:52:38.421 --> 00:52:39.254
<v Speaker 1>As the Avatar of a divine principle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that divine principle is the </v>

927
00:52:41.811 --> 00:52:42.644
<v Speaker 1>capacity to use your speech to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to the chaos of the world and to </v>

928
00:52:46.731 --> 00:52:50.300
<v Speaker 1>criticize structures of order that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>become corrupt and reformulate them.</v>

929
00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:51.733
<v Speaker 1>And so you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have this territory that surrounds </v>

930
00:52:54.261 --> 00:52:55.410
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's in violet,</v>

931
00:52:56.400 --> 00:53:00.890
<v Speaker 1>that something about you that transcends</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the reach of the law,</v>

932
00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:02.600
<v Speaker 1>which is a very strange thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

933
00:53:02.601 --> 00:53:05.090
<v Speaker 1>because in our societies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're a murderer,</v>

934
00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:08.730
<v Speaker 1>even if everyone knows it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still have inviolable rights.</v>

935
00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:13.760
<v Speaker 1>You think of all the things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>unlikely to have emerged as a concept.</v>

936
00:53:13.761 --> 00:53:16.880
<v Speaker 1>That's got to be like number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been a very long,</v>

937
00:53:16.881 --> 00:53:17.714
<v Speaker 1>long struggle for human beings to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that we embodied this </v>

938
00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:26.370
<v Speaker 1>principle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that continually generates the</v>

939
00:53:26.371 --> 00:53:31.050
<v Speaker 1>world out of chaos and revitalizes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't becomes corrupt and dead and</v>

940
00:53:31.051 --> 00:53:31.884
<v Speaker 1>that's the key as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's expressed in John is that </v>

941
00:53:35.521 --> 00:53:40.521
<v Speaker 1>there isn't any difference between that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the capacity to carefully articulate</v>

942
00:53:40.831 --> 00:53:41.664
<v Speaker 1>the nature of your experience to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and then to respond to the </v>

943
00:53:44.791 --> 00:53:45.624
<v Speaker 1>corrective feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the way that human beings </v>

944
00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:50.940
<v Speaker 1>progress through the world and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate principle.</v>

945
00:53:50.941 --> 00:53:51.774
<v Speaker 1>That should be at the top of what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of as the set of all human </v>

946
00:53:55.531 --> 00:53:56.970
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

947
00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:59.640
<v Speaker 1>Something will move you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hierarchy,</v>

948
00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:03.300
<v Speaker 1>something slightly different will move </v>
<v Speaker 1>you up a different hierarchy.</v>

949
00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:06.060
<v Speaker 1>You'd take a huge set of hierarchies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

950
00:54:06.061 --> 00:54:06.894
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the principle that's going to </v>

951
00:54:08.221 --> 00:54:11.550
<v Speaker 1>work best over across all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies?</v>

952
00:54:11.551 --> 00:54:14.580
<v Speaker 1>It's something like the capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak the truth,</v>

953
00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:16.523
<v Speaker 1>and so that's how it looks to me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I think apart from the </v>

954
00:54:18.691 --> 00:54:20.490
<v Speaker 1>practical reasons that already </v>
<v Speaker 1>described,</v>

955
00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:21.533
<v Speaker 1>I know that's a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information to process and I hope that </v>

956
00:54:25.621 --> 00:54:28.440
<v Speaker 1>made some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very difficult thing to boil down</v>

957
00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:30.270
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a short period of time.</v>

958
00:54:30.271 --> 00:54:31.104
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd been trying to do that for like 30 </v>

959
00:54:32.071 --> 00:54:36.690
<v Speaker 1>years to get it coherent enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>represented in a short period of time,</v>

960
00:54:36.691 --> 00:54:37.524
<v Speaker 1>but there's the practical issue which is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how we encountered what we don't </v>

961
00:54:41.671 --> 00:54:42.504
<v Speaker 1>understand and turn it into habitable </v>
<v Speaker 1>space and how we communicate about it </v>

962
00:54:46.351 --> 00:54:47.184
<v Speaker 1>and reach consensus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's something much deeper </v>

963
00:54:49.801 --> 00:54:53.790
<v Speaker 1>underneath that which is that we know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and we know it really,</v>

964
00:54:53.791 --> 00:54:54.624
<v Speaker 1>really deeply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole human race is been aiming at </v>

965
00:54:56.871 --> 00:54:57.704
<v Speaker 1>that for God only knows how long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's hundreds of thousands of years </v>

966
00:55:00.871 --> 00:55:02.910
<v Speaker 1>certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it might be far longer than that.</v>

967
00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:04.373
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not a principle that we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>dispense with and assume that we'll </v>

968
00:55:07.411 --> 00:55:08.244
<v Speaker 1>construct something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay in this absence because it's </v>

969
00:55:10.471 --> 00:55:11.304
<v Speaker 1>actually an expression of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental nature of human beings and </v>

970
00:55:14.371 --> 00:55:17.580
<v Speaker 1>we mess with that are at our extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>peril.</v>

971
00:55:17.790 --> 00:55:20.730
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what we're doing now.</v>

972
00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:22.193
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

973
00:55:23.770 --> 00:55:24.603
<v Speaker 1>So that's part of the reason why </v>
<v Speaker 1>objected to bill [inaudible] because I </v>

974
00:55:28.721 --> 00:55:29.554
<v Speaker 1>don't think that it's reasonable for </v>
<v Speaker 1>government authorities to put their God </v>

975
00:55:34.081 --> 00:55:37.840
<v Speaker 1>damn words into their citizens mouth and</v>
<v Speaker 1>as simple as that,</v>

976
00:55:37.841 --> 00:55:38.674
<v Speaker 1>I think there isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's almost nothing you could embark </v>

977
00:55:40.871 --> 00:55:42.670
<v Speaker 1>on that would be more dangerous than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

978
00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:47.500
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that this had to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>purportedly had to do with the rights of</v>

979
00:55:47.501 --> 00:55:50.900
<v Speaker 1>a small minority of people I think is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete side show.</v>

980
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:55.390
<v Speaker 1>I think it's almost irrelevant in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to the broader context.</v>

981
00:55:55.391 --> 00:55:56.224
<v Speaker 1>And I think that if that wasn't the case</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there wouldn't have been any fear </v>

982
00:55:59.501 --> 00:56:03.220
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever about what I said because who</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hell cares what I have to say?</v>

983
00:56:03.850 --> 00:56:08.060
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my take on it.</v>

984
00:56:08.061 --> 00:56:10.340
<v Speaker 1>So that's all I've got to say.</v>

985
00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:15.720
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

986
00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:24.130
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

987
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:26.830
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned the form of dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you,</v>

988
00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:27.933
<v Speaker 1>when you were giving a lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned that you're not in fact </v>

989
00:56:30.491 --> 00:56:34.900
<v Speaker 1>engaging in a monologue because by </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking and seeing her reactions,</v>

990
00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:36.393
<v Speaker 1>you're constantly modifying your speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was wondering if you could speak up </v>

991
00:56:40.370 --> 00:56:45.240
<v Speaker 1>because I'm probably the only millennial</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this room or no,</v>

992
00:56:45.250 --> 00:56:45.580
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

993
00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:46.660
<v Speaker 1>One more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one more.</v>

994
00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:50.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as someone who's kind of grown up in</v>

995
00:56:50.861 --> 00:56:53.260
<v Speaker 1>the Internet and who in fact has social </v>
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>

996
00:56:53.261 --> 00:56:58.261
<v Speaker 1>do you think sites like facebook and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much twitter,</v>

997
00:56:58.541 --> 00:56:59.374
<v Speaker 1>but basically facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do they stop this dialogue or how do </v>

998
00:57:03.341 --> 00:57:04.174
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the ramifications of such </v>

999
00:57:05.531 --> 00:57:06.364
<v Speaker 1>things if people are communicating with </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other without really being in the </v>

1000
00:57:10.061 --> 00:57:13.900
<v Speaker 1>same room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what for you is lost?</v>

1001
00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:15.903
<v Speaker 1>I think it's sort of analogous to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>danger of derivatives in the financial </v>

1002
00:57:18.791 --> 00:57:20.000
<v Speaker 1>market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1003
00:57:20.290 --> 00:57:24.250
<v Speaker 1>because like a derivative is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can amplify the degree to which the</v>

1004
00:57:24.251 --> 00:57:25.270
<v Speaker 1>market moves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1005
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Because it's an abstraction from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying reality.</v>

1006
00:57:27.821 --> 00:57:31.630
<v Speaker 1>So it's more powerful for good and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>more powerful for evil.</v>

1007
00:57:31.631 --> 00:57:33.580
<v Speaker 1>And I would say so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1008
00:57:33.581 --> 00:57:35.290
<v Speaker 1>if you're thinking about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphorically,</v>

1009
00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:38.440
<v Speaker 1>well it's an amplifier and that can be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good thing,</v>

1010
00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:40.743
<v Speaker 1>but it can also be a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it does often amplify the </v>

1011
00:57:44.681 --> 00:57:48.160
<v Speaker 1>proclivity of people to disappear into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>self reflective bubble.</v>

1012
00:57:48.161 --> 00:57:52.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's aided by the algorithms that </v>
<v Speaker 1>feed to you what you want to see.</v>

1013
00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:56.380
<v Speaker 1>So and we don't know exactly what that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do.</v>

1014
00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:57.190
<v Speaker 1>It's not a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1015
00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:58.023
<v Speaker 1>it's a very dangerous thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're building an unconscious into the </v>

1016
00:58:00.911 --> 00:58:01.744
<v Speaker 1>internet and no one's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand how it works because it gets </v>

1017
00:58:04.871 --> 00:58:07.990
<v Speaker 1>more and more complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when ai kicks in in a big way</v>

1018
00:58:07.991 --> 00:58:11.020
<v Speaker 1>because you can't understand how those </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems work even though they work.</v>

1019
00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:12.393
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with that unconscious in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet is it filters information </v>

1020
00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:18.100
<v Speaker 1>and you don't know what the filtering is</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>

1021
00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:19.630
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what your own filtering </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1022
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:20.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're not conscious of your </v>

1023
00:58:22.571 --> 00:58:23.404
<v Speaker 1>underlying processes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this adds a whole new dimension to </v>

1024
00:58:25.691 --> 00:58:26.524
<v Speaker 1>it and the fact that it's self </v>
<v Speaker 1>fulfilling in some sense increases the </v>

1025
00:58:30.281 --> 00:58:33.490
<v Speaker 1>probability of positive feedback loops </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will go out of control.</v>

1026
00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:37.270
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that it kind of locks you </v>
<v Speaker 1>into your own,</v>

1027
00:58:38.550 --> 00:58:39.383
<v Speaker 1>maybe the story of Your Life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm not afraid personally on a </v>

1028
00:58:41.871 --> 00:58:46.871
<v Speaker 1>frequent social media it I see it as no </v>
<v Speaker 1>people posting about themselves,</v>

1029
00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:49.133
<v Speaker 1>their other relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it creates a constant </v>

1030
00:58:52.310 --> 00:58:53.143
<v Speaker 1>feedback loop that it's kind of like I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking of a would if this is the guy </v>

1031
00:58:57.681 --> 00:58:59.250
<v Speaker 1>that looks nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>narcissists,</v>

1032
00:58:59.310 --> 00:59:03.240
<v Speaker 1>narcissists looking at your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflection in the mirror and not.</v>

1033
00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:05.863
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what happens is that you're not </v>

1034
00:59:06.790 --> 00:59:10.530
<v Speaker 1>allowing other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that is a danger.</v>

1035
00:59:10.531 --> 00:59:15.531
<v Speaker 1>I also think though is that you also </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall prone to the implicit narcissism of</v>

1036
00:59:17.821 --> 00:59:18.654
<v Speaker 1>all the other facebook users and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>well because people generally post </v>

1037
00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:25.880
<v Speaker 1>glowing reviews of their own life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1038
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:26.743
<v Speaker 1>to some degree that's understandable </v>
<v Speaker 1>because who wants to be subject to a </v>

1039
00:59:30.231 --> 00:59:31.064
<v Speaker 1>constant barrage of misery?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's reasons that people do </v>

1040
00:59:33.861 --> 00:59:35.930
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They post themselves when they're having</v>

1041
00:59:35.931 --> 00:59:37.640
<v Speaker 1>fun when they're doing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectacular,</v>

1042
00:59:37.641 --> 00:59:38.474
<v Speaker 1>but that also means that you're being </v>
<v Speaker 1>blasted all the time by these endless </v>

1043
00:59:41.931 --> 00:59:45.110
<v Speaker 1>images of other people having a far </v>
<v Speaker 1>better time of life than you are.</v>

1044
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:46.483
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do know that there is some evidence </v>

1045
00:59:50.631 --> 00:59:53.810
<v Speaker 1>that more exposure to facebook means </v>
<v Speaker 1>more depression.</v>

1046
00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:58.370
<v Speaker 1>Now it's hard to pull out correlation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and causality there,</v>

1047
00:59:58.371 --> 00:59:59.204
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then in the political sphere you </v>

1048
01:00:00.771 --> 01:00:04.880
<v Speaker 1>have the same problem because you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>being fair and unbiased.</v>

1049
01:00:04.881 --> 01:00:05.714
<v Speaker 1>Sample of information and your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>initial biases are multiplied by the </v>

1050
01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:09.673
<v Speaker 1>algorithms that select for you what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to look at and we don't </v>

1051
01:00:12.561 --> 01:00:13.394
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have no idea what the consequence of </v>

1052
01:00:14.451 --> 01:00:15.920
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

1053
01:00:18.330 --> 01:00:20.930
<v Speaker 3>thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A incidentally,</v>

1054
01:00:20.931 --> 01:00:23.930
<v Speaker 3>I have a questions that concern </v>
<v Speaker 3>something similar,</v>

1055
01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:28.190
<v Speaker 3>but I'm talking about the real face to </v>
<v Speaker 3>face conversation.</v>

1056
01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:29.024
<v Speaker 3>You said how important it is for us as </v>
<v Speaker 3>speaker to get some feedback of your </v>

1057
01:00:32.391 --> 01:00:34.010
<v Speaker 3>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1058
01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:39.080
<v Speaker 3>having grown up in east Germany behalf </v>
<v Speaker 3>learned to look this,</v>

1059
01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:40.093
<v Speaker 3>no expression whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the most outrageous stupid sinks </v>

1060
01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:44.533
<v Speaker 3>because the consequences of like rolling</v>
<v Speaker 3>your eyes Wednesday we're talking about </v>

1061
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:53.710
<v Speaker 3>us being well ahead economically of </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be just very negative.</v>

1062
01:00:53.901 --> 01:00:54.734
<v Speaker 3>So we didn't do that and I see something</v>
<v Speaker 3>similar happening here in especially in </v>

1063
01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:01.603
<v Speaker 3>certain political lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if somebody tells you that what you </v>

1064
01:01:05.511 --> 01:01:06.344
<v Speaker 3>are doing or Taltz and audience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you are doing is horrible and I'm </v>

1065
01:01:09.561 --> 01:01:10.394
<v Speaker 3>in that audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't roll my eyes because I know </v>

1066
01:01:13.191 --> 01:01:17.150
<v Speaker 3>what set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the consequences are now,</v>

1067
01:01:17.151 --> 01:01:18.380
<v Speaker 3>of course in</v>

1068
01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:21.660
<v Speaker 1>those are microaggressions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1069
01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.160
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding.</v>

1070
01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:24.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what it is.</v>

1071
01:01:24.590 --> 01:01:27.260
<v Speaker 1>The eye rolling in particular is a sign </v>
<v Speaker 1>of contempt.</v>

1072
01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:28.550
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1073
01:01:28.550 --> 01:01:29.300
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1074
01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:32.370
<v Speaker 3>but of course if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I never do that to you,</v>

1075
01:01:32.490 --> 01:01:35.300
<v Speaker 3>you now get the impressions that what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you say.</v>

1076
01:01:35.301 --> 01:01:39.460
<v Speaker 3>It's just wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you don't get to critical feet at as,</v>

1077
01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:42.320
<v Speaker 3>as you pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very important for you.</v>

1078
01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:45.140
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Course said goals,</v>

1079
01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:46.850
<v Speaker 3>bolts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>waste.</v>

1080
01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.360
<v Speaker 3>So it's actually one of the on the</v>

1081
01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:51.410
<v Speaker 1>mental defenses of free speech is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>your dish,</v>

1082
01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:52.353
<v Speaker 1>if you constrain it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're depriving people of corrective </v>

1083
01:01:55.151 --> 01:01:58.360
<v Speaker 1>feedback and that's a very bad thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because people,</v>

1084
01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:01.480
<v Speaker 1>people cannot maintain sanity in </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolation.</v>

1085
01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:02.433
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you outsource your sanity to other </v>

1086
01:02:04.181 --> 01:02:08.320
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're vaguely socially acceptable.</v>

1087
01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:09.453
<v Speaker 1>What that means is people can tolerate </v>
<v Speaker 1>having you around and then they will </v>

1088
01:02:13.001 --> 01:02:16.000
<v Speaker 1>provide you with corrective feedback and</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as you react to that,</v>

1089
01:02:16.001 --> 01:02:19.500
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to worry about being sane</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they'll keep you way.</v>

1090
01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:20.820
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

1091
01:02:20.821 --> 01:02:24.000
<v Speaker 1>you can manage your sanity by yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

1092
01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.310
<v Speaker 1>it's too complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

1093
01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:27.480
<v Speaker 1>it's not possible.</v>

1094
01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:29.093
<v Speaker 4>So it's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just inhibiting these speech </v>

1095
01:02:31.650 --> 01:02:35.950
<v Speaker 4>but also inhibiting a natural reaction </v>
<v Speaker 4>to speech.</v>

1096
01:02:36.350 --> 01:02:37.190
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1097
01:02:37.191 --> 01:02:39.140
<v Speaker 1>send the spontaneous reactions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1098
01:02:39.141 --> 01:02:41.240
<v Speaker 1>Because a lot of those facial gestures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those aren't,</v>

1099
01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:42.373
<v Speaker 1>those aren't precisely conscious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually good because they're </v>

1100
01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:48.820
<v Speaker 1>untrammeled expressions of your initial </v>
<v Speaker 1>instincts.</v>

1101
01:02:48.821 --> 01:02:50.150
<v Speaker 1>Something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1102
01:02:50.151 --> 01:02:52.190
<v Speaker 1>it's like having dogs around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1103
01:02:52.191 --> 01:02:55.130
<v Speaker 1>if you're agitated and upset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dog will get all nervous.</v>

1104
01:02:55.131 --> 01:02:55.581
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1105
01:02:55.581 --> 01:02:57.980
<v Speaker 1>you can trust that the dog doesn't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>an agenda,</v>

1106
01:02:58.460 --> 01:02:59.293
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people are like that in their </v>

1107
01:03:00.081 --> 01:03:00.914
<v Speaker 1>initial responses to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that doesn't mean they're </v>

1108
01:03:02.841 --> 01:03:03.674
<v Speaker 1>correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it at least it means that it's not </v>

1109
01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:10.970
<v Speaker 1>mediated by like an ideological bias or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not so straightforwardly.</v>

1110
01:03:11.170 --> 01:03:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Just before we hear from Eva,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to mention that,</v>

1111
01:03:14.151 --> 01:03:16.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we let our hypothesis die in our steps.</v>

1112
01:03:16.890 --> 01:03:19.460
<v Speaker 1>Karl Popper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite philosophers.</v>

1113
01:03:19.490 --> 01:03:20.400
<v Speaker 1>Copper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1114
01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:24.053
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to say thank you for most </v>

1115
01:03:25.590 --> 01:03:26.423
<v Speaker 4>interesting a presentation and online,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which a lot of us you haven't heard </v>

1116
01:03:31.951 --> 01:03:34.860
<v Speaker 4>before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so thank you for that.</v>

1117
01:03:35.370 --> 01:03:36.390
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've,</v>

1118
01:03:36.410 --> 01:03:39.300
<v Speaker 4>the two things that I wanted to ask you </v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

1119
01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:40.523
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the concept that you've enunciated of </v>

1120
01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:47.610
<v Speaker 4>the emergence over an extremely long </v>
<v Speaker 4>period of time,</v>

1121
01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:52.550
<v Speaker 4>of the idea that we all have somewhat of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the divine in us,</v>

1122
01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:56.730
<v Speaker 4>which I suppose also implies that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>have someone of the opposite as well.</v>

1123
01:03:57.290 --> 01:03:58.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is hard.</v>

1124
01:03:58.650 --> 01:04:03.650
<v Speaker 4>That leads directly to the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual rights versus group,</v>

1125
01:04:06.541 --> 01:04:07.680
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1126
01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:09.083
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of the troubles that all of us</v>
<v Speaker 4>here faced is that we have become the </v>

1127
01:04:13.201 --> 01:04:14.380
<v Speaker 4>target of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1128
01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:17.490
<v Speaker 4>these group demands for group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1129
01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:22.680
<v Speaker 4>Rather than individual rights art or </v>
<v Speaker 4>attaining or not that</v>

1130
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:25.303
<v Speaker 4>that march towards the higher </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies of society based on our own </v>

1131
01:04:30.181 --> 01:04:32.190
<v Speaker 4>effort and our own performances and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

1132
01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:33.413
<v Speaker 4>So that's one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's also the other side of </v>

1133
01:04:35.341 --> 01:04:36.174
<v Speaker 4>another thing that you raised,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which one really hears in any of these </v>

1134
01:04:38.851 --> 01:04:42.240
<v Speaker 4>kinds of meetings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the biological basis of our behavior.</v>

1135
01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:44.413
<v Speaker 4>And I was really interested to hear you </v>
<v Speaker 4>bring this into the discussion because </v>

1136
01:04:48.541 --> 01:04:49.374
<v Speaker 4>it has seemed to me over the years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've been around this business into </v>

1137
01:04:53.431 --> 01:04:55.420
<v Speaker 4>the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think when it all troubled,</v>

1138
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:56.263
<v Speaker 4>seemed to have started,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that a lot of the feminism nonsense </v>

1139
01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:04.110
<v Speaker 4>is involved with the denial of </v>
<v Speaker 4>differences between males and females.</v>

1140
01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:05.933
<v Speaker 4>A lot of the problems with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>performance and affirmative action and </v>

1141
01:05:10.171 --> 01:05:11.004
<v Speaker 4>so on is the denial that there may be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>biological basis to some of the </v>

1142
01:05:15.751 --> 01:05:18.490
<v Speaker 4>performance differences that we see in </v>
<v Speaker 4>various</v>

1143
01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:21.960
<v Speaker 1>fields of activity around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1144
01:05:22.330 --> 01:05:23.163
<v Speaker 1>and also this idea that we can decide </v>
<v Speaker 1>what gender we are tomorrow morning and </v>

1145
01:05:26.961 --> 01:05:30.070
<v Speaker 1>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must say I'd never heard of this.</v>

1146
01:05:30.071 --> 01:05:31.100
<v Speaker 1>So what did you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1147
01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:31.993
<v Speaker 1>the Gender Unicorn and I will do when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>go and the instructor olds and six year </v>

1148
01:05:37.451 --> 01:05:41.610
<v Speaker 1>old will be subjected to this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>positively alarming.</v>

1149
01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:45.180
<v Speaker 1>So I just asked you to comment</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1150
01:05:45.230 --> 01:05:46.063
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1151
01:05:46.330 --> 01:05:48.640
<v Speaker 1>they call that biological essentialism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1152
01:05:48.641 --> 01:05:49.990
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

1153
01:05:50.110 --> 01:05:52.270
<v Speaker 1>that's a curse word essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1154
01:05:52.271 --> 01:05:54.190
<v Speaker 1>If so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

1155
01:05:54.191 --> 01:05:55.024
<v Speaker 1>that's partly why I objected to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>legislation and surrounding policy </v>

1156
01:05:57.791 --> 01:05:58.624
<v Speaker 1>because it doesn't allow for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological influence and so which is </v>

1157
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:08.430
<v Speaker 1>preposterous in my estimation and mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>the biology actually is much more useful</v>

1158
01:06:09.821 --> 01:06:12.520
<v Speaker 1>than people even realize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1159
01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:13.413
<v Speaker 1>one of the things we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier today was say the distinction </v>

1160
01:06:17.441 --> 01:06:20.080
<v Speaker 1>between conservatives and liberals.</v>

1161
01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:25.380
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>produces right wing authoritarianism.</v>

1162
01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:29.080
<v Speaker 1>It's very interesting and you wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>guess this in a million years.</v>

1163
01:06:30.010 --> 01:06:30.843
<v Speaker 1>Prevalence of infectious disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was a great paper published </v>

1164
01:06:34.511 --> 01:06:35.344
<v Speaker 1>three years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was brilliant prevalence of </v>

1165
01:06:37.391 --> 01:06:38.224
<v Speaker 1>infectious disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was published in a journal called </v>

1166
01:06:41.201 --> 01:06:46.000
<v Speaker 1>plause one and these researchers were </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in this hypothesis called the</v>

1167
01:06:46.001 --> 01:06:46.834
<v Speaker 1>behavioral immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you know very frequently when </v>

1168
01:06:49.901 --> 01:06:50.734
<v Speaker 1>here too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for isolated human groups come into </v>

1169
01:06:52.241 --> 01:06:55.300
<v Speaker 1>contact that either one group or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other dies,</v>

1170
01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:56.313
<v Speaker 1>like maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe all of them are virtually all of </v>

1171
01:06:58.001 --> 01:06:58.834
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's essentially what happened to the </v>

1172
01:06:59.531 --> 01:07:02.560
<v Speaker 1>native Americans when the Spaniards hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>Central America.</v>

1173
01:07:02.590 --> 01:07:03.423
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they didn't have any built in </v>

1174
01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:05.913
<v Speaker 1>immunity to smallpox or chicken pox or </v>
<v Speaker 1>mumps or measles and like success of </v>

1175
01:07:10.541 --> 01:07:13.240
<v Speaker 1>epidemics just wiped them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The estimates vary,</v>

1176
01:07:13.241 --> 01:07:14.074
<v Speaker 1>but it could be as high as 95 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it appears as though the border </v>

1177
01:07:20.471 --> 01:07:22.510
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of thick borders,</v>

1178
01:07:22.511 --> 01:07:23.344
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a fundamentally conservative </v>

1179
01:07:24.551 --> 01:07:25.210
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

1180
01:07:25.210 --> 01:07:28.510
<v Speaker 1>The liberals want open borders and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of information flow in the conservatives</v>

1181
01:07:28.511 --> 01:07:29.344
<v Speaker 1>want closed borders and more restriction</v>
<v Speaker 1>and protection at every level of the of </v>

1182
01:07:33.491 --> 01:07:36.250
<v Speaker 1>the conceptual hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just political borders,</v>

1183
01:07:36.251 --> 01:07:39.700
<v Speaker 1>its borders around everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that seems to be tightly associated,</v>

1184
01:07:39.701 --> 01:07:40.534
<v Speaker 1>at least in part with the prevalence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>infectious disease both at the country </v>

1185
01:07:43.391 --> 01:07:44.224
<v Speaker 1>level and at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the local level within countries and </v>

1186
01:07:46.481 --> 01:07:47.314
<v Speaker 1>the correlations like point seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not trivial and it's not with </v>

1187
01:07:49.811 --> 01:07:50.644
<v Speaker 1>governmental authoritarian attitudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's with individual authoritarian </v>

1188
01:07:53.411 --> 01:07:54.244
<v Speaker 1>attitudes at in the locales where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're infectious diseases are </v>

1189
01:07:57.671 --> 01:08:01.540
<v Speaker 1>prevalent and it seems to be associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the emotion of disgust,</v>

1190
01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:05.800
<v Speaker 1>so Hitler wasn't afraid of the Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conservatives aren't afraid of others.</v>

1191
01:08:05.801 --> 01:08:08.200
<v Speaker 1>That isn't how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're disgusted.</v>

1192
01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:11.470
<v Speaker 1>That's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's associated with a personality trait</v>

1193
01:08:11.471 --> 01:08:12.304
<v Speaker 1>called orderliness and so hit re once </v>
<v Speaker 1>this has been sorted out by </v>

1194
01:08:17.181 --> 01:08:19.220
<v Speaker 1>psychologists over about the last 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

1195
01:08:19.221 --> 01:08:20.054
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what when I was plowing through the </v>

1196
01:08:22.191 --> 01:08:25.130
<v Speaker 1>literature and working on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between disgust,</v>

1197
01:08:25.131 --> 01:08:25.964
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity and personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I happened to reread Hitler's table </v>

1198
01:08:29.331 --> 01:08:30.164
<v Speaker 1>talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a collection of his </v>

1199
01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:35.370
<v Speaker 1>spontaneous speeches collected at </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinnertime,</v>

1200
01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:40.390
<v Speaker 1>lunchtimes by secretaries from 1939 to </v>
<v Speaker 1>1942 and one.</v>

1201
01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:43.970
<v Speaker 1>Once I knew this other information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just leapt out at me,</v>

1202
01:08:43.971 --> 01:08:44.804
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Hitler was a admirer of willpower </v>

1203
01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:49.880
<v Speaker 1>that makes them a conscientious type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

1204
01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:53.600
<v Speaker 1>very obsessed with order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>washed his hands,</v>

1205
01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:58.190
<v Speaker 1>continually was hyper clean and disgust </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitive.</v>

1206
01:08:58.490 --> 01:09:03.490
<v Speaker 1>And his primary metaphor for the German </v>
<v Speaker 1>people was a body area in body pure body</v>

1207
01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:06.223
<v Speaker 1>under assault by parasites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pure disgust and contamination </v>

1208
01:09:10.071 --> 01:09:13.160
<v Speaker 1>language and it's mediated by disgust </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity.</v>

1209
01:09:13.370 --> 01:09:16.580
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicts that kind of right wing,</v>

1210
01:09:16.581 --> 01:09:17.414
<v Speaker 1>close the border attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's also heightened in places </v>

1211
01:09:20.241 --> 01:09:22.140
<v Speaker 1>where infectious diseases are a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

1212
01:09:22.141 --> 01:09:24.710
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to eliminate right wing </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism,</v>

1213
01:09:24.711 --> 01:09:28.940
<v Speaker 1>it actually looks like one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do is as promote public health</v>

1214
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:31.280
<v Speaker 1>programs everywhere to rid the world of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1215
01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:34.040
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that that's possible of </v>
<v Speaker 1>infectious diseases.</v>

1216
01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:35.653
<v Speaker 1>Well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to impede the flow between </v>

1217
01:09:38.031 --> 01:09:41.000
<v Speaker 1>people if there's infectious diseases </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere obviously.</v>

1218
01:09:41.330 --> 01:09:43.700
<v Speaker 1>And that manifests itself in political </v>
<v Speaker 1>attitudes.</v>

1219
01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:44.803
<v Speaker 1>So there's the biology reaches way </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeper than than people are willing to </v>

1220
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:51.463
<v Speaker 1>like to assume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some of the things that it tells us </v>

1221
01:09:53.751 --> 01:09:58.220
<v Speaker 1>are unbelievably useful to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being terrible to know in some sense,</v>

1222
01:09:58.221 --> 01:10:02.420
<v Speaker 1>but useful to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'd like the walls work on,</v>

1223
01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:05.690
<v Speaker 1>on the stability of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of primate hierarchies.</v>

1224
01:10:05.691 --> 01:10:06.524
<v Speaker 1>Incredibly important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's been looking at the </v>

1225
01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:08.713
<v Speaker 1>emergence of protocol morality among </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees and that seems to be driven </v>

1226
01:10:12.141 --> 01:10:14.360
<v Speaker 1>in large part by the dominance hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

1227
01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:16.570
<v Speaker 1>And it's not exactly a dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy either.</v>

1228
01:10:16.571 --> 01:10:19.280
<v Speaker 1>That's probably not exactly the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to think about it because,</v>

1229
01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:22.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance implies pure power,</v>

1230
01:10:23.210 --> 01:10:24.043
<v Speaker 1>but lots of human hierarchies aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchies and all their </v>

1231
01:10:25.911 --> 01:10:27.950
<v Speaker 1>competence hierarchies or something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1232
01:10:27.951 --> 01:10:29.450
<v Speaker 1>So it's very different.</v>

1233
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.570
<v Speaker 5>I'm a libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I favor of freedom,</v>

1234
01:10:35.571 --> 01:10:36.404
<v Speaker 5>but unlike a lot of libertarians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that there's kind of a </v>

1235
01:10:39.381 --> 01:10:40.214
<v Speaker 5>natural affinity to freedom among human </v>
<v Speaker 5>beings that evolution has actually </v>

1236
01:10:45.051 --> 01:10:45.884
<v Speaker 5>trained us to be conformists much more </v>
<v Speaker 5>than freedom loving individualists </v>

1237
01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:51.150
<v Speaker 5>absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1238
01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:52.890
<v Speaker 5>and as a result of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1239
01:10:52.930 --> 01:10:55.490
<v Speaker 5>I mean because,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because in our evolutionary history,</v>

1240
01:10:55.910 --> 01:11:00.200
<v Speaker 5>it was often much more important to row </v>
<v Speaker 5>all in the same direction.</v>

1241
01:11:00.230 --> 01:11:01.180
<v Speaker 5>The clan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1242
01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:05.000
<v Speaker 5>the roughly</v>
<v Speaker 5>related,</v>

1243
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:08.150
<v Speaker 5>genetically related clans that were </v>
<v Speaker 5>roaming the,</v>

1244
01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:09.393
<v Speaker 5>it was much more important to row in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>same direction than to row in the right </v>

1245
01:11:11.961 --> 01:11:12.794
<v Speaker 5>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As long as you didn't roll off the off </v>

1246
01:11:14.431 --> 01:11:18.390
<v Speaker 5>the cliff or run off the cliff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that would be bad.</v>

1247
01:11:18.391 --> 01:11:19.224
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but as long as you were muddling </v>

1248
01:11:20.191 --> 01:11:21.024
<v Speaker 5>through,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was better for everyone to be in the </v>

1249
01:11:22.591 --> 01:11:23.424
<v Speaker 5>same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so therefore we evolve to be very </v>

1250
01:11:27.241 --> 01:11:29.850
<v Speaker 5>much conformists and people like you.</v>

1251
01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:31.313
<v Speaker 5>And to lesser extent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the rest of us in this room are the </v>

1252
01:11:33.901 --> 01:11:37.710
<v Speaker 5>disruptors were the ones who are </v>
<v Speaker 5>nonconformist were the ones who say,</v>

1253
01:11:37.770 --> 01:11:38.603
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait a minute,</v>

1254
01:11:38.670 --> 01:11:40.030
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't sound right to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1255
01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:43.800
<v Speaker 5>and we're the ones who want to lead </v>
<v Speaker 5>society back to chaos,</v>

1256
01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:44.933
<v Speaker 5>the state of chaos where everyone's got </v>
<v Speaker 5>their own little little view of how </v>

1257
01:11:48.301 --> 01:11:49.134
<v Speaker 5>things should go instead of following </v>
<v Speaker 5>the leader and just doing what everyone </v>

1258
01:11:51.271 --> 01:11:52.104
<v Speaker 5>else does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's why people like you attract </v>

1259
01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:56.333
<v Speaker 5>to meet to my way of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why people like you attract such </v>

1260
01:11:59.581 --> 01:12:03.450
<v Speaker 5>a visceral,</v>
<v Speaker 5>angry reaction is that you're,</v>

1261
01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:04.313
<v Speaker 5>you're leading us back into chaos and if</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't all ignore you and shut you </v>

1262
01:12:07.591 --> 01:12:10.020
<v Speaker 5>down and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're all going to be,</v>

1263
01:12:10.190 --> 01:12:11.023
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the state where the clan is fighting </v>

1264
01:12:13.981 --> 01:12:16.590
<v Speaker 5>amongst each other instead of rowing in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the same direction.</v>

1265
01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:18.690
<v Speaker 5>If you have any thoughts on that.</v>

1266
01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:21.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think certainly one of the things I've</v>

1267
01:12:21.551 --> 01:12:22.121
<v Speaker 1>learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

1268
01:12:22.121 --> 01:12:22.954
<v Speaker 1>I already knew before all this happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people were primarily conforming </v>

1269
01:12:26.890 --> 01:12:27.723
<v Speaker 1>and I actually don't have much of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with that because most of the </v>

1270
01:12:30.761 --> 01:12:35.761
<v Speaker 1>time the tradition is correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes it's not correct at all.</v>

1271
01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:38.590
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1272
01:12:38.650 --> 01:12:39.483
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I always tell my </v>
<v Speaker 1>clients and my students for that matter </v>

1273
01:12:41.801 --> 01:12:42.634
<v Speaker 1>is you should do what everyone else does</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you have a really good reason to </v>

1274
01:12:47.681 --> 01:12:48.514
<v Speaker 1>vary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I learned from </v>

1275
01:12:49.871 --> 01:12:52.330
<v Speaker 1>young Carl young was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you do very,</v>

1276
01:12:52.331 --> 01:12:55.660
<v Speaker 1>you should try to only do it in a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>of directions because you probably can't</v>

1277
01:12:55.661 --> 01:12:56.494
<v Speaker 1>handle doing it more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just too much to too much </v>

1278
01:12:59.261 --> 01:13:01.310
<v Speaker 1>psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1279
01:13:01.330 --> 01:13:02.163
<v Speaker 1>the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that sometimes the group is rolling </v>

1280
01:13:03.701 --> 01:13:08.701
<v Speaker 1>off a cliff and then it's then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's partly why the individual in some</v>

1281
01:13:08.741 --> 01:13:12.040
<v Speaker 1>senses the eternal savior of the group </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the group is.</v>

1282
01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:14.830
<v Speaker 1>It has the aspect of sheep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1283
01:13:14.831 --> 01:13:15.664
<v Speaker 1>and the sheep are doing fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got the whole herd thing going </v>

1284
01:13:18.221 --> 01:13:19.054
<v Speaker 1>for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decreases the risk of individual </v>

1285
01:13:20.591 --> 01:13:23.020
<v Speaker 1>predation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got all their nervous systems in</v>

1286
01:13:23.021 --> 01:13:25.150
<v Speaker 1>tune.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's real utility in the herd,</v>

1287
01:13:25.450 --> 01:13:26.283
<v Speaker 1>but they're also subject to all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems that herds have like heard </v>

1288
01:13:29.021 --> 01:13:30.910
<v Speaker 1>panic or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>

1289
01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:33.940
<v Speaker 1>So that's not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what human beings figured out was</v>

1290
01:13:33.941 --> 01:13:36.700
<v Speaker 1>that being part of the herd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although necessary,</v>

1291
01:13:36.701 --> 01:13:37.534
<v Speaker 1>isn't good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There has to be a balance between the </v>

1292
01:13:40.091 --> 01:13:44.350
<v Speaker 1>tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old dead tradition and the vivifying</v>

1293
01:13:44.351 --> 01:13:45.980
<v Speaker 1>force of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

1294
01:13:45.981 --> 01:13:50.800
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the living essentially that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>those are actually how the gods split up</v>

1295
01:13:50.801 --> 01:13:51.634
<v Speaker 1>and need you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because Horace was roughly a </v>

1296
01:13:52.871 --> 01:13:53.704
<v Speaker 1>representation of the living and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>cyrus was roughly a representation of </v>

1297
01:13:56.321 --> 01:13:57.154
<v Speaker 1>the dead and it was the combined </v>
<v Speaker 1>combination of those two that made up </v>

1298
01:14:00.011 --> 01:14:05.011
<v Speaker 1>the sovereign very intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like dramatic political philosophy.</v>

1299
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:07.030
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1300
01:14:07.031 --> 01:14:09.340
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I have seen since </v>
<v Speaker 1>September is,</v>

1301
01:14:09.341 --> 01:14:12.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean I knew that people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>conformance,</v>

1302
01:14:12.251 --> 01:14:15.730
<v Speaker 1>but I really had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really had no idea to what degree that</v>

1303
01:14:15.731 --> 01:14:17.260
<v Speaker 1>was true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1304
01:14:17.261 --> 01:14:18.950
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've got very,</v>

1305
01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:19.793
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very few letters of support from people </v>

1306
01:14:21.491 --> 01:14:25.810
<v Speaker 1>who are academics for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they get secret reports.</v>

1307
01:14:25.811 --> 01:14:26.411
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1308
01:14:26.411 --> 01:14:29.080
<v Speaker 1>people will come and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we agree with what you're doing,</v>

1309
01:14:29.081 --> 01:14:30.940
<v Speaker 1>but we wish you could be a little nicer </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

1310
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:32.710
<v Speaker 1>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

1311
01:14:32.770 --> 01:14:33.603
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a funny thing for people to say </v>

1312
01:14:34.511 --> 01:14:37.030
<v Speaker 1>because it implies that if they did what</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing,</v>

1313
01:14:37.031 --> 01:14:39.010
<v Speaker 1>they would do a better job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1314
01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:40.690
<v Speaker 1>which is fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1315
01:14:40.691 --> 01:14:42.790
<v Speaker 1>you can always try it out and see how it</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes.</v>

1316
01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:43.680
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1317
01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:47.010
<v Speaker 5>when I gave talks in</v>
<v Speaker 5>equity,</v>

1318
01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:48.353
<v Speaker 5>one of the most common comments I would </v>
<v Speaker 5>get after the thing's over and people </v>

1319
01:14:51.071 --> 01:14:52.830
<v Speaker 5>that are milling around and shaking your</v>
<v Speaker 5>hand is,</v>

1320
01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:55.500
<v Speaker 5>I agree with everything you said that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>would never say.</v>

1321
01:14:55.650 --> 01:14:56.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1322
01:14:56.611 --> 01:14:58.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no wonder it's not,</v>

1323
01:14:58.191 --> 01:14:59.520
<v Speaker 1>it's not surprising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1324
01:14:59.521 --> 01:15:00.354
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are real reasons not to stick out </v>

1325
01:15:01.891 --> 01:15:03.750
<v Speaker 1>from the herd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

1326
01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:08.130
<v Speaker 1>if you mark a zebra so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>identify it against the herd,</v>

1327
01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:11.130
<v Speaker 1>the lions will kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1328
01:15:11.131 --> 01:15:15.930
<v Speaker 1>And that's that Ban Italia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one that you like because they can't,</v>

1329
01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:16.793
<v Speaker 1>they can't organize their haunted less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can identify the individual lines </v>

1330
01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:21.600
<v Speaker 1>dazzled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right,</v>

1331
01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:24.330
<v Speaker 1>while they're camouflaged against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>herd zebras.</v>

1332
01:15:24.990 --> 01:15:25.950
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1333
01:15:25.951 --> 01:15:28.050
<v Speaker 1>that's worth knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It explains a lot that.</v>

1334
01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:29.903
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

1335
01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:37.020
<v Speaker 6>Thanks very much for elaborating.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Very,</v>

1336
01:15:37.021 --> 01:15:38.940
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very compellingly.</v>

1337
01:15:38.941 --> 01:15:43.941
<v Speaker 6>The fundamental significance of thought </v>
<v Speaker 6>and speech are almost impossible to,</v>

1338
01:15:44.430 --> 01:15:46.650
<v Speaker 6>at our point in development to two </v>
<v Speaker 6>separate,</v>

1339
01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:48.900
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>

1340
01:15:49.290 --> 01:15:51.270
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the trans issue,</v>

1341
01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:53.850
<v Speaker 6>which is the particularity that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>very important.</v>

1342
01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:54.950
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1343
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:55.783
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1344
01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:57.560
<v Speaker 6>I would agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I'm,</v>

1345
01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:59.160
<v Speaker 6>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm a sex researcher,</v>

1346
01:15:59.161 --> 01:16:01.600
<v Speaker 6>so people are going to ask me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1347
01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:02.453
<v Speaker 6>the Trans Issue I think is an </v>
<v Speaker 6>appropriate lightening rod for social </v>

1348
01:16:06.361 --> 01:16:08.030
<v Speaker 6>constructionism.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1349
01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:10.200
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as a,</v>

1350
01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:11.093
<v Speaker 6>as a researcher in this field,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can tell you that John Money was </v>

1351
01:16:12.961 --> 01:16:16.350
<v Speaker 6>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kids aren't Tabula Rosa and you know,</v>

1352
01:16:16.351 --> 01:16:18.370
<v Speaker 6>Micky diamond was right and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1353
01:16:18.530 --> 01:16:21.270
<v Speaker 6>etc. And now you're in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 6>YeAh.</v>

1354
01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:25.800
<v Speaker 6>The presence,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the presence of police officers here was</v>

1355
01:16:25.801 --> 01:16:28.010
<v Speaker 6>actually a very interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1356
01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:33.060
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>underscoring of the power of thought and</v>

1357
01:16:33.061 --> 01:16:37.020
<v Speaker 6>speech and the millennial issue of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>internet,</v>

1358
01:16:37.470 --> 01:16:38.303
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>reminds us that we don't choose our </v>

1359
01:16:40.621 --> 01:16:41.454
<v Speaker 6>audience.</v>

1360
01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:42.660
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the internet.</v>

1361
01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:45.480
<v Speaker 6>you're basically exposed to the world,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1362
01:16:45.481 --> 01:16:50.481
<v Speaker 6>and you're a tendency to self center to </v>
<v Speaker 6>avert being trolled is probably great.</v>

1363
01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:53.490
<v Speaker 6>At any rate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1364
01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:55.260
<v Speaker 6>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just,</v>

1365
01:16:55.261 --> 01:16:57.270
<v Speaker 6>just background.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My colleagues are going to,</v>

1366
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.900
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1367
01:16:57.900 --> 01:16:59.220
<v Speaker 6>my colleague,</v>
<v Speaker 6>ken zucker,</v>

1368
01:16:59.730 --> 01:17:01.290
<v Speaker 6>who,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of your colleagues at the university</v>

1369
01:17:01.291 --> 01:17:02.124
<v Speaker 6>of toronto was recently fired for his </v>
<v Speaker 6>departure from common wisdom and it </v>

1370
01:17:07.471 --> 01:17:08.304
<v Speaker 6>wasn't much of a departure and in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he represents common wisdom on the </v>

1371
01:17:11.571 --> 01:17:14.540
<v Speaker 6>trance phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Having said all that,</v>

1372
01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:17.420
<v Speaker 6>mY colleagues are going to ask you two </v>
<v Speaker 6>questions,</v>

1373
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:19.280
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>asked me two questions.</v>

1374
01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:23.900
<v Speaker 6>If he meT joan who was trans feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1375
01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:27.200
<v Speaker 6>male to female transsexual,</v>
<v Speaker 6>would you refer to her as joan?</v>

1376
01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:29.890
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's simpler.</v>

1377
01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:30.793
<v Speaker 6>And the other issue is midst all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>garbage and the hype and the let's </v>

1378
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:36.500
<v Speaker 6>reassigned a three year old and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1379
01:17:36.890 --> 01:17:39.110
<v Speaker 6>stuff that I think all of us would </v>
<v Speaker 6>regard as nonsense.</v>

1380
01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:40.353
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>many of us in some of us in this room </v>

1381
01:17:41.961 --> 01:17:45.080
<v Speaker 6>deal with trans individuals every day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1382
01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:46.650
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1383
01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:48.950
<v Speaker 6>some gay individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's just the way they,</v>

1384
01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:49.820
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

1385
01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:51.360
<v Speaker 6>they emerged in life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1386
01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:54.500
<v Speaker 6>they're genuine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're not particularly begging special</v>

1387
01:17:54.501 --> 01:17:55.770
<v Speaker 6>privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1388
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:57.360
<v Speaker 6>my colleagues get to say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>would you,</v>

1389
01:17:57.510 --> 01:17:59.720
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'd call her joan and would you,</v>

1390
01:17:59.721 --> 01:18:00.554
<v Speaker 6>would you accord her authenticity or </v>
<v Speaker 6>reality or whereas she socially </v>

1391
01:18:06.291 --> 01:18:08.150
<v Speaker 6>constructing herself or was she born </v>
<v Speaker 6>that way?</v>

1392
01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the devil's always in the details.</v>

1393
01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:12.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1394
01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:14.950
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's emerging right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

1395
01:18:14.951 --> 01:18:19.360
<v Speaker 1>although this is a fringe viewpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like imagine that you're dating</v>

1396
01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:21.993
<v Speaker 1>while you prejudiced</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people's prejudices shine forth </v>

1397
01:18:26.051 --> 01:18:28.090
<v Speaker 1>most clearly in their choice of </v>
<v Speaker 1>partners,</v>

1398
01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:30.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They choose people who are.</v>

1399
01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:31.440
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1400
01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:35.930
<v Speaker 1>people's prejudice is shine forth most </v>
<v Speaker 1>brightly in their choice of,</v>

1401
01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:38.110
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of sexual partners,</v>

1402
01:18:38.530 --> 01:18:40.480
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We prefer young people.</v>

1403
01:18:40.510 --> 01:18:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we prefer healthy people.</v>

1404
01:18:43.630 --> 01:18:47.530
<v Speaker 1>We prefer people of our own race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We prefer people of our own religion.</v>

1405
01:18:48.130 --> 01:18:48.963
<v Speaker 1>We prefer high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the highest performing individuals we </v>

1406
01:18:51.551 --> 01:18:52.384
<v Speaker 1>can get our hands on generally speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the whole that steeply </v>

1407
01:18:55.481 --> 01:18:57.970
<v Speaker 1>prejudicial and one of the things that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>emerging,</v>

1408
01:18:58.330 --> 01:18:59.163
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say in the trans community </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there isn't such a thing as far </v>

1409
01:19:01.541 --> 01:19:04.900
<v Speaker 1>as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but among certain individuals is they're</v>

1410
01:19:04.901 --> 01:19:08.860
<v Speaker 1>dubious of your right to choose your </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual partner based on their genitalia,</v>

1411
01:19:08.861 --> 01:19:09.250
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

1412
01:19:09.250 --> 01:19:12.610
<v Speaker 1>Because that's a form of discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah.</v>

1413
01:19:12.611 --> 01:19:13.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1414
01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:14.760
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you in,</v>

1415
01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:15.683
<v Speaker 1>in huxley's brave new world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where thinking about you </v>

1416
01:19:18.431 --> 01:19:22.210
<v Speaker 1>didn't get to you was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a social full part.</v>

1417
01:19:22.211 --> 01:19:25.120
<v Speaker 1>It turned down as sexual request because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's discriminatory.</v>

1418
01:19:25.121 --> 01:19:26.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1419
01:19:26.081 --> 01:19:28.390
<v Speaker 1>it is discriminatory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

1420
01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:31.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the deepest form of discrimination,</v>

1421
01:19:31.810 --> 01:19:34.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're basically saying you're basically</v>

1422
01:19:34.091 --> 01:19:36.370
<v Speaker 1>saying yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1423
01:19:36.371 --> 01:19:37.204
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you had to do in </v>

1424
01:19:39.791 --> 01:19:40.624
<v Speaker 1>huxley's brave new world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you also weren't allowed to have a </v>

1425
01:19:43.090 --> 01:19:46.810
<v Speaker 1>long term monogamous relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the exclusionary element of that</v>

1426
01:19:46.811 --> 01:19:49.780
<v Speaker 1>was regarded as prejudicial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it is.</v>

1427
01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:52.330
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

1428
01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:54.100
<v Speaker 1>And so the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1429
01:19:54.770 --> 01:19:55.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could say,</v>

1430
01:19:55.631 --> 01:19:56.200
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

1431
01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:57.940
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't discriminate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1432
01:19:57.941 --> 01:19:58.774
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on exactly what you mean by </v>

1433
01:20:00.131 --> 01:20:02.620
<v Speaker 1>discriminate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course the argument is about</v>

1434
01:20:02.621 --> 01:20:03.520
<v Speaker 1>exactly what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1435
01:20:03.521 --> 01:20:06.730
<v Speaker 1>I have to discriminate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And increasingly the answer is none.</v>

1436
01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:09.630
<v Speaker 1>Like we've already sacrificed freedom of</v>
<v Speaker 1>assembly.</v>

1437
01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:12.870
<v Speaker 1>We're pretty much on the way to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrificing freedom of speech.</v>

1438
01:20:13.090 --> 01:20:15.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a logical conclusion to all of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

1439
01:20:19.690 --> 01:20:20.523
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to be asked by colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is your view of the authenticity </v>

1440
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:29.460
<v Speaker 6>that is</v>
<v Speaker 6>always identified as the opposite gender</v>

1441
01:20:29.470 --> 01:20:31.800
<v Speaker 6>now have much better that I've </v>
<v Speaker 6>transitioned.</v>

1442
01:20:33.150 --> 01:20:33.571
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1443
01:20:33.571 --> 01:20:34.404
<v Speaker 1>that's a part that I'm more skeptical </v>
<v Speaker 1>about because the evidence isn't all </v>

1444
01:20:36.811 --> 01:20:37.644
<v Speaker 1>that clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people do feel better when they </v>

1445
01:20:38.611 --> 01:20:40.230
<v Speaker 1>transition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1446
01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:41.470
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1447
01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:42.870
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1448
01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:44.520
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1449
01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:45.593
<v Speaker 1>there's the fact that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories doesn't mean there aren't </v>

1450
01:20:48.481 --> 01:20:49.314
<v Speaker 1>exceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's exceptions now what those </v>

1451
01:20:51.811 --> 01:20:52.644
<v Speaker 1>exceptions signify?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's generally to be dealt with </v>

1452
01:20:54.661 --> 01:20:58.050
<v Speaker 1>on an individual to individual basis and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine with me.</v>

1453
01:20:58.140 --> 01:20:59.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a clinician,</v>

1454
01:20:59.101 --> 01:21:03.060
<v Speaker 1>I've dealt with all sorts of people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't and who fits in the categories.</v>

1455
01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:04.073
<v Speaker 1>Nobody like to become socialized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you do is you mangle your square </v>

1456
01:21:07.831 --> 01:21:08.664
<v Speaker 1>peg into a round hole and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mean for some people it's </v>

1457
01:21:11.071 --> 01:21:14.160
<v Speaker 1>obviously far more of a sacrifice than </v>
<v Speaker 1>for others,</v>

1458
01:21:14.161 --> 01:21:16.380
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social being demands,</v>

1459
01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:21.330
<v Speaker 1>what would you call restriction of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least have your individuality and all</v>

1460
01:21:21.331 --> 01:21:23.580
<v Speaker 1>sorts of different aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for some people,</v>

1461
01:21:23.581 --> 01:21:25.470
<v Speaker 1>that's much more of a sacrifice than </v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

1462
01:21:25.890 --> 01:21:29.400
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does the existence of the exception</v>

1463
01:21:29.730 --> 01:21:30.563
<v Speaker 1>imply for the general case?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I believe that if you're a </v>

1464
01:21:33.151 --> 01:21:38.151
<v Speaker 1>postmodernist and a marxist underneath </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it supplies the excuse to take down</v>

1465
01:21:38.251 --> 01:21:41.070
<v Speaker 1>the category of gender and why would you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that?</v>

1466
01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:41.933
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a category used by the oppressive </v>

1467
01:21:43.141 --> 01:21:45.600
<v Speaker 1>patriarchy to continue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's to continue.</v>

1468
01:21:45.601 --> 01:21:47.730
<v Speaker 1>It's pathological power seeking</v>

1469
01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:50.400
<v Speaker 6>distinction between no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>leave me alone.</v>

1470
01:21:50.401 --> 01:21:55.401
<v Speaker 6>I want to get on with my life versus</v>
<v Speaker 6>the category so that there's room for</v>

1471
01:21:56.590 --> 01:21:57.423
<v Speaker 1>yes precisely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I'm going to dismiss the category on </v>

1472
01:21:59.831 --> 01:22:02.500
<v Speaker 1>behalf of someone else who I claim to </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak for,</v>

1473
01:22:02.501 --> 01:22:04.180
<v Speaker 1>which is even more commonly the case</v>

1474
01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:05.553
<v Speaker 6>general environment where oppression and</v>
<v Speaker 6>identity are the currency of status and </v>

1475
01:22:09.831 --> 01:22:10.664
<v Speaker 6>advantage.</v>

1476
01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:11.673
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1477
01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:12.491
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1478
01:22:12.491 --> 01:22:15.070
<v Speaker 1>and I just don't see that it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be all that useful.</v>

1479
01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Kids are confused enough when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up.</v>

1480
01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:22.030
<v Speaker 1>I think to add gender confusion to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we're doing very,</v>

1481
01:22:22.031 --> 01:22:25.630
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly is going to destroy 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1482
01:22:25.631 --> 01:22:26.464
<v Speaker 1>For every one it saves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be more than that because </v>

1483
01:22:29.381 --> 01:22:31.240
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of confused people out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1484
01:22:31.241 --> 01:22:33.580
<v Speaker 1>I would say like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two out of 30,</v>

1485
01:22:33.581 --> 01:22:34.414
<v Speaker 1>something like that are just barely </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinging onto the to the edges of </v>

1486
01:22:36.911 --> 01:22:37.744
<v Speaker 1>reality and they're looking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptance and transmutation wherever </v>

1487
01:22:40.901 --> 01:22:41.734
<v Speaker 1>they can find it and confusing them </v>
<v Speaker 1>further isn't going to help and these </v>

1488
01:22:44.861 --> 01:22:45.694
<v Speaker 1>people that were transitioning young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be one hell of a </v>

1489
01:22:48.041 --> 01:22:50.410
<v Speaker 1>kickback from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell yoU when they hit the,</v>

1490
01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:51.700
<v Speaker 1>when they hit adulthood.</v>

1491
01:22:56.260 --> 01:22:58.870
<v Speaker 7>Let me just follow up on grant brown's </v>
<v Speaker 7>question.</v>

1492
01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:00.873
<v Speaker 7>Jordan is among the top fIve or top 10 </v>
<v Speaker 7>professors in north America during the </v>

1493
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:06.903
<v Speaker 7>past year who's been a lightning rod,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a target of collective efforts at </v>

1494
01:23:11.141 --> 01:23:11.974
<v Speaker 7>humiliation and being disgraced.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And mY question is essentially if you </v>

1495
01:23:18.701 --> 01:23:22.420
<v Speaker 7>could give as parsimonious answer as you</v>
<v Speaker 7>can,</v>

1496
01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:26.170
<v Speaker 7>which generally isn't very personable,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've noticed.</v>

1497
01:23:26.171 --> 01:23:30.040
<v Speaker 7>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of why you.</v>

1498
01:23:30.910 --> 01:23:33.900
<v Speaker 7>and it's a remarkable phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1499
01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:38.710
<v Speaker 7>when somebody is demonized to the extent</v>
<v Speaker 7>that you have been in mainstream media.</v>

1500
01:23:39.310 --> 01:23:44.310
<v Speaker 7>I was reading just lately.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've picked up in a carpet can ix office</v>

1501
01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:47.740
<v Speaker 7>a copy of toronto life.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>

1502
01:23:47.741 --> 01:23:50.530
<v Speaker 7>There was this nice job by,</v>
<v Speaker 7>by,</v>

1503
01:23:50.531 --> 01:23:52.870
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a kind of wide eyed reporter,</v>

1504
01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:56.000
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he doesn't seem like a demon know,</v>

1505
01:23:56.200 --> 01:24:00.940
<v Speaker 7>he seems like a kind of nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He even seems a little bit on the left,</v>

1506
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:04.120
<v Speaker 7>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he must be a demon there somewhere.</v>

1507
01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:08.560
<v Speaker 7>So the question is just as briefly as </v>
<v Speaker 7>you can why you.</v>

1508
01:24:09.190 --> 01:24:10.260
<v Speaker 7>Because I said there was some</v>

1509
01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:13.130
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1510
01:24:13.290 --> 01:24:17.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean because like all these massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>

1511
01:24:17.161 --> 01:24:17.994
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they manifest themselves in micro </v>

1512
01:24:20.190 --> 01:24:21.330
<v Speaker 1>examples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1513
01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:22.433
<v Speaker 1>many micro examples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're micro examples and so </v>

1514
01:24:25.470 --> 01:24:26.303
<v Speaker 1>there's always a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary penis when you decided to not </v>

1515
01:24:29.371 --> 01:24:32.610
<v Speaker 1>go along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the arbitrary ness is like,</v>

1516
01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:33.473
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said that I wouldn't use these words </v>

1517
01:24:34.591 --> 01:24:36.330
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and had a rationale for it.</v>

1518
01:24:36.331 --> 01:24:40.500
<v Speaker 1>And then people test you out when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you put up your hand,</v>

1519
01:24:40.501 --> 01:24:41.550
<v Speaker 1>they test you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think,</v>

1520
01:24:41.551 --> 01:24:42.780
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you just a monster?</v>

1521
01:24:42.810 --> 01:24:46.590
<v Speaker 1>Well let's throw a bunch of monster </v>
<v Speaker 1>words at you and see if they stick.</v>

1522
01:24:46.650 --> 01:24:47.483
<v Speaker 1>See if you can defend yourself because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good way of finding out </v>

1523
01:24:49.711 --> 01:24:52.620
<v Speaker 1>whether you're actually a monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that was the first,</v>

1524
01:24:52.710 --> 01:24:53.543
<v Speaker 1>let's say two months of all of this was </v>
<v Speaker 1>me just sort of fending off these </v>

1525
01:24:58.170 --> 01:24:59.250
<v Speaker 1>different accusations.</v>

1526
01:24:59.250 --> 01:25:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was fortunate in many ways.</v>

1527
01:25:02.130 --> 01:25:02.963
<v Speaker 1>I was fortunate in that in the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrations that followed the the </v>

1528
01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:09.183
<v Speaker 1>videos that the people who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>supporting me behaved reasonably well </v>

1529
01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:15.533
<v Speaker 1>compared to the people who weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you could think about that as </v>

1530
01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:21.180
<v Speaker 1>somewhat dependent on chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not entirely,</v>

1531
01:25:21.181 --> 01:25:22.014
<v Speaker 1>but things could have gone badly the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other way and also I was protected by </v>

1532
01:25:26.071 --> 01:25:26.904
<v Speaker 1>the fact that I already had about 400 </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours of videos online and so virtually </v>

1533
01:25:30.871 --> 01:25:31.704
<v Speaker 1>everything I had said to students in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last well over the span of 30 years </v>

1534
01:25:35.341 --> 01:25:37.470
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but particularly in the last five years,</v>

1535
01:25:37.471 --> 01:25:38.304
<v Speaker 1>was all recorded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if anybody wanted to find out if </v>

1536
01:25:40.651 --> 01:25:41.484
<v Speaker 1>I was a monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all they had to do is go through the </v>

1537
01:25:43.201 --> 01:25:44.034
<v Speaker 1>painful process of listening to what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had to say and there were no smoking </v>

1538
01:25:47.101 --> 01:25:48.630
<v Speaker 1>guns buried in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

1539
01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:49.980
<v Speaker 1>which is significant.</v>

1540
01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:53.100
<v Speaker 1>Given that there were 200 hours of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1541
01:25:53.101 --> 01:25:53.934
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1542
01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:54.893
<v Speaker 1>you'd think there'd be something in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there that I said that could have been </v>

1543
01:25:57.090 --> 01:26:00.420
<v Speaker 1>taken out of context that would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>really walled me a good one,</v>

1544
01:26:00.421 --> 01:26:05.150
<v Speaker 1>but so far nobody seems to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>extracted so.</v>

1545
01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:06.673
<v Speaker 1>And I also think that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the next reason would be I </v>

1546
01:26:09.381 --> 01:26:10.214
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just apart from saying there was </v>

1547
01:26:11.511 --> 01:26:12.344
<v Speaker 1>something specific I wouldn't do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which brings the abstraction down to a </v>

1548
01:26:15.591 --> 01:26:16.880
<v Speaker 1>point of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1549
01:26:16.881 --> 01:26:17.191
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1550
01:26:17.191 --> 01:26:18.024
<v Speaker 1>it's a line that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes it real rather than just an </v>

1551
01:26:20.991 --> 01:26:21.824
<v Speaker 1>abstract critique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the other thing thAt happened </v>

1552
01:26:23.781 --> 01:26:27.290
<v Speaker 1>was that people came to my website </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the political material,</v>

1553
01:26:27.291 --> 01:26:28.124
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't where they stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They started listening to what I had to </v>

1554
01:26:29.961 --> 01:26:33.350
<v Speaker 1>say and I think that what I have to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually revolutionary.</v>

1555
01:26:33.890 --> 01:26:35.900
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think people have a sense of that.</v>

1556
01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:38.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like it as far as I can tell,</v>

1557
01:26:38.331 --> 01:26:40.610
<v Speaker 1>the response seems to indicate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1558
01:26:40.611 --> 01:26:41.444
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shared some of that with you today </v>

1559
01:26:43.130 --> 01:26:46.340
<v Speaker 1>that the idea that some of our values </v>
<v Speaker 1>are grounded in,</v>

1560
01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:50.060
<v Speaker 1>in phenomena that are far more </v>
<v Speaker 1>primordial,</v>

1561
01:26:50.061 --> 01:26:51.830
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then our mere opinion,</v>

1562
01:26:51.831 --> 01:26:53.590
<v Speaker 1>like that's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's,</v>

1563
01:26:53.591 --> 01:26:55.340
<v Speaker 1>if there's anything about it that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

1564
01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:56.690
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1565
01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:00.400
<v Speaker 1>but I've been trying to puzzle this out </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time and uh,</v>

1566
01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:01.813
<v Speaker 1>it seems to cohere and when people try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to apply the principles that I've been </v>

1567
01:27:05.661 --> 01:27:08.450
<v Speaker 1>discussing in their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes their lives better.</v>

1568
01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:10.850
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's so interesting too because I've</v>

1569
01:27:10.851 --> 01:27:12.630
<v Speaker 1>been going around speaking publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1570
01:27:12.631 --> 01:27:15.860
<v Speaker 1>and most of my audience is men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interestingly enough,</v>

1571
01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:16.933
<v Speaker 1>even in the live talks and all I've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing with the man basically is talking </v>

1572
01:27:22.011 --> 01:27:24.950
<v Speaker 1>to them about saying what's true and </v>
<v Speaker 1>adopting responsibility.</v>

1573
01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:27.830
<v Speaker 1>And they're so bloody hungry for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is just mind boggling,</v>

1574
01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:29.133
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something really curious and </v>

1575
01:27:30.351 --> 01:27:33.440
<v Speaker 1>interesting to me because that's not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>saleable message.</v>

1576
01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:34.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1577
01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:36.620
<v Speaker 1>it's because are basically saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1578
01:27:36.621 --> 01:27:40.130
<v Speaker 1>find the heaviest load you can conceive </v>
<v Speaker 1>of and try to pick it up.</v>

1579
01:27:40.131 --> 01:27:41.390
<v Speaker 1>And while you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1580
01:27:41.570 --> 01:27:42.403
<v Speaker 1>try to engage in the least amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>deceit as possible and that that's also </v>

1581
01:27:45.981 --> 01:27:48.950
<v Speaker 1>a pathway out of suffering for people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>

1582
01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:50.053
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so interesting to see how </v>

1583
01:27:51.351 --> 01:27:56.351
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably positively the people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are following this are responding.</v>

1584
01:27:57.050 --> 01:27:58.550
<v Speaker 1>They're responding to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1585
01:27:59.390 --> 01:28:00.223
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking to a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential leaders of the conservative </v>

1586
01:28:02.991 --> 01:28:03.824
<v Speaker 1>party and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I've told them </v>

1587
01:28:05.331 --> 01:28:06.164
<v Speaker 1>repeatedly is you guys have something to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sell young people for the first time </v>

1588
01:28:09.201 --> 01:28:11.720
<v Speaker 1>that I can remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's responsibility.</v>

1589
01:28:12.050 --> 01:28:14.450
<v Speaker 1>The left is selling freedom and rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1590
01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:15.313
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's the other half of the story </v>

1591
01:28:17.570 --> 01:28:20.120
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's freedom to drown.</v>

1592
01:28:20.150 --> 01:28:20.983
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got nothing against freedom </v>

1593
01:28:21.831 --> 01:28:22.664
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no rights without </v>

1594
01:28:25.011 --> 01:28:27.770
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities and there's no freedom </v>
<v Speaker 1>without tradition.</v>

1595
01:28:27.771 --> 01:28:30.470
<v Speaker 1>So somebody's got to tell the other half</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the story.</v>

1596
01:28:31.190 --> 01:28:33.890
<v Speaker 1>So Dr. Peterson three more questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that okay?</v>

1597
01:28:33.891 --> 01:28:35.420
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to wear you down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1598
01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:36.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1599
01:28:37.010 --> 01:28:38.090
<v Speaker 1>you're too late for that.</v>

1600
01:28:43.330 --> 01:28:44.163
<v Speaker 8>Thanks a lot Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm remembering a conversation we had </v>

1601
01:28:47.110 --> 01:28:48.550
<v Speaker 8>about a month ago.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yep.</v>

1602
01:28:49.690 --> 01:28:53.650
<v Speaker 8>Cafe in ottawa.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And some of the issues we discussed then</v>

1603
01:28:53.651 --> 01:28:55.810
<v Speaker 8>brought up again today.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

1604
01:28:56.650 --> 01:28:59.590
<v Speaker 8>it leads to certain we didn't resolve </v>
<v Speaker 8>anything.</v>

1605
01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:02.310
<v Speaker 8>I think ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and I doubt if we ever will,</v>

1606
01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:06.240
<v Speaker 8>and it seems to me the real problem is </v>
<v Speaker 8>something you mentioned today.</v>

1607
01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:07.433
<v Speaker 8>We could go a little further with it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's the question that's pontius pilots </v>

1608
01:29:10.410 --> 01:29:12.900
<v Speaker 8>question,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the first postmodernist what is truth?</v>

1609
01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:14.573
<v Speaker 8>And it was taken up many times,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but by nature and the genealogy of </v>

1610
01:29:17.641 --> 01:29:18.474
<v Speaker 8>morals were all truth is interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And of course this is not the case with </v>

1611
01:29:21.721 --> 01:29:24.270
<v Speaker 8>nisha and anybody who follows him,</v>
<v Speaker 8>as you pointed out,</v>

1612
01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:25.553
<v Speaker 8>because that's somebody else's truth,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that there is no truth and therefore </v>

1613
01:29:27.841 --> 01:29:30.770
<v Speaker 8>what do you do with that?</v>
<v Speaker 8>And you're into the problem of the creek</v>

1614
01:29:30.771 --> 01:29:34.920
<v Speaker 8>and liar.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But here is the problem for me even with</v>

1615
01:29:34.921 --> 01:29:36.510
<v Speaker 8>your talk,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which is as usual,</v>

1616
01:29:36.511 --> 01:29:37.344
<v Speaker 8>brilliant and I think grounded and in </v>
<v Speaker 8>tremendous amount of factual </v>

1617
01:29:40.351 --> 01:29:41.184
<v Speaker 8>information.</v>

1618
01:29:41.970 --> 01:29:45.270
<v Speaker 8>I was asked once a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>after a book of mine came out,</v>

1619
01:29:45.271 --> 01:29:47.400
<v Speaker 8>which was contested hockley by many </v>
<v Speaker 8>people.</v>

1620
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:50.610
<v Speaker 8>What gave me the right to think I had </v>
<v Speaker 8>the truth.</v>

1621
01:29:50.611 --> 01:29:51.444
<v Speaker 8>This was an interviewer in toronto for </v>
<v Speaker 8>the random house thing and why did I </v>

1622
01:29:55.981 --> 01:29:56.814
<v Speaker 8>think what I was saying was true.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Who was I to say that I had the truth </v>

1623
01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:02.430
<v Speaker 8>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't have the truth,</v>

1624
01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:03.953
<v Speaker 8>and I had to come up with some </v>
<v Speaker 8>explanation quickly in some kind of </v>

1625
01:30:06.181 --> 01:30:07.740
<v Speaker 8>phrase and it just occurred to me.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I said,</v>

1626
01:30:07.770 --> 01:30:10.710
<v Speaker 8>all I have is this credible </v>
<v Speaker 8>verisimilitude.</v>

1627
01:30:11.370 --> 01:30:13.020
<v Speaker 8>What is credible?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Various similitude.</v>

1628
01:30:13.050 --> 01:30:15.420
<v Speaker 8>He wanted to know.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I said a,</v>

1629
01:30:15.421 --> 01:30:18.870
<v Speaker 8>it depends on gathering as much evidence</v>
<v Speaker 8>as you possibly can,</v>

1630
01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:21.510
<v Speaker 8>even if you have to counter your own </v>
<v Speaker 8>biases.</v>

1631
01:30:21.511 --> 01:30:22.344
<v Speaker 8>You just said with as least the least </v>
<v Speaker 8>amount of deceit or self indulgence as </v>

1632
01:30:26.731 --> 01:30:30.600
<v Speaker 8>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and the second factor is common sense,</v>

1633
01:30:30.601 --> 01:30:32.910
<v Speaker 8>which seems to be not so common these </v>
<v Speaker 8>days.</v>

1634
01:30:33.330 --> 01:30:34.163
<v Speaker 8>So if you can put evidence and coMmon </v>
<v Speaker 8>sense together and at the same time try </v>

1635
01:30:38.101 --> 01:30:40.950
<v Speaker 8>and marshall and monitor your own </v>
<v Speaker 8>proclivities.</v>

1636
01:30:41.550 --> 01:30:42.383
<v Speaker 8>I went right,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but that was hard with my book as I was </v>

1637
01:30:44.881 --> 01:30:48.630
<v Speaker 8>left before I could go right and I had </v>
<v Speaker 8>to make that decision.</v>

1638
01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:49.493
<v Speaker 8>Do I want to go right and lose all my </v>
<v Speaker 8>friends or do I want to stay left and </v>

1639
01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:55.980
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>have catholic men and joy my friends and</v>

1640
01:30:55.981 --> 01:30:58.920
<v Speaker 8>saw I had to go right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Because that's what the evidence told me</v>

1641
01:30:58.950 --> 01:31:01.710
<v Speaker 8>against my own desires.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So honesty,</v>

1642
01:31:01.711 --> 01:31:06.711
<v Speaker 8>if you can manage it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>evidence and common sense,</v>

1643
01:31:06.781 --> 01:31:08.910
<v Speaker 8>but here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Truths.</v>

1644
01:31:09.210 --> 01:31:12.220
<v Speaker 8>It's still there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How do you get from credible?</v>

1645
01:31:12.221 --> 01:31:14.970
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>various similitude to truth.</v>

1646
01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:17.720
<v Speaker 8>Where is the bridge?</v>
<v Speaker 8>How do you get there?</v>

1647
01:31:17.770 --> 01:31:21.120
<v Speaker 8>Nobody can say that ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yes,</v>

1648
01:31:21.170 --> 01:31:24.390
<v Speaker 8>but the problem I think you can,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you can say certain things are true.</v>

1649
01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:25.680
<v Speaker 8>Certain dates,</v>
<v Speaker 8>etc. Etc.</v>

1650
01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:28.830
<v Speaker 8>Certain things have happened for men </v>
<v Speaker 8>have suffered as a result of feminism.</v>

1651
01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:32.400
<v Speaker 8>All this is true,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but we're truth seems to founder is when</v>

1652
01:31:32.401 --> 01:31:33.234
<v Speaker 8>you enter the realm of cars who has the </v>
<v Speaker 8>truth to explain why feminism developed </v>

1653
01:31:40.231 --> 01:31:43.620
<v Speaker 8>in the way it did,</v>
<v Speaker 8>or why climate warming or global warming</v>

1654
01:31:43.621 --> 01:31:46.250
<v Speaker 8>developed in the way in d did.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We can point out the facts.</v>

1655
01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:47.200
<v Speaker 8>This is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this is wrong,</v>

1656
01:31:47.310 --> 01:31:50.910
<v Speaker 8>this is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But when you get out of the element,</v>

1657
01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:55.140
<v Speaker 8>the region of events and into the region</v>
<v Speaker 8>of the cause of his,</v>

1658
01:31:56.910 --> 01:31:57.743
<v Speaker 8>that's the bridge,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the gap from credible verisimilitude to </v>

1659
01:32:00.311 --> 01:32:01.144
<v Speaker 8>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and I franKly don't know how to manage </v>

1660
01:32:03.371 --> 01:32:04.204
<v Speaker 8>that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So the conclusion I'm coming to is a </v>

1661
01:32:06.101 --> 01:32:07.840
<v Speaker 8>little bit different from your </v>
<v Speaker 8>conclusion.</v>

1662
01:32:07.841 --> 01:32:11.290
<v Speaker 8>It's not the one that I want to come to </v>
<v Speaker 8>and I would like to resist it,</v>

1663
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:13.990
<v Speaker 8>but the conclusion I'm coming to is </v>
<v Speaker 8>quite simply,</v>

1664
01:32:14.140 --> 01:32:14.973
<v Speaker 8>we're fucked.</v>

1665
01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's always been true,</v>

1666
01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:20.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The apocalypse is always.</v>

1667
01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:21.413
<v Speaker 1>That's why the apocalypse is eternal </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the world's always coming to an </v>

1668
01:32:23.971 --> 01:32:27.810
<v Speaker 1>end and it's actually true in small ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in great ways.</v>

1669
01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:33.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean with regards to to your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your ideas about truth.</v>

1670
01:32:33.301 --> 01:32:38.130
<v Speaker 1>I would say that like language truth is </v>
<v Speaker 1>more like a process.</v>

1671
01:32:38.850 --> 01:32:40.850
<v Speaker 1>And I would say it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1672
01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:41.743
<v Speaker 1>it's a process that you actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>embodied rather than conceptualiZe </v>

1673
01:32:44.401 --> 01:32:47.910
<v Speaker 1>abstractly to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the ways I've thought about it is</v>

1674
01:32:47.911 --> 01:32:51.960
<v Speaker 1>that if you're seeking the truth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you don't know is more important to</v>

1675
01:32:51.961 --> 01:32:55.500
<v Speaker 1>you than what you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a fundamental orientation,</v>

1676
01:32:55.501 --> 01:32:56.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1677
01:32:56.310 --> 01:32:59.400
<v Speaker 1>what I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I've been doing since september,</v>

1678
01:32:59.401 --> 01:33:01.290
<v Speaker 1>and I've had friends who've been helping</v>
<v Speaker 1>me with this,</v>

1679
01:33:01.291 --> 01:33:02.124
<v Speaker 1>but I think I've been doing this for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time as I'm trying to figure out </v>

1680
01:33:04.081 --> 01:33:04.980
<v Speaker 1>where I'm wrong.</v>

1681
01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:07.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching the audience to see if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>making mistake.</v>

1682
01:33:07.921 --> 01:33:08.754
<v Speaker 1>I'm listening to my friends who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching my youtube videos telling me </v>

1683
01:33:10.951 --> 01:33:15.570
<v Speaker 1>what I'm a little too angry maybe or </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe too pompous or too noisy,</v>

1684
01:33:15.571 --> 01:33:18.270
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the different ways that you can fail</v>

1685
01:33:18.271 --> 01:33:19.104
<v Speaker 1>in front of an audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm listening to them and listening to </v>

1686
01:33:21.091 --> 01:33:24.390
<v Speaker 1>the comments and I'm trying to modify </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself accordingly.</v>

1687
01:33:24.770 --> 01:33:25.603
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you live in error and strive </v>

1688
01:33:27.331 --> 01:33:28.164
<v Speaker 1>towards the truth and it's in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>striving that the truth is most </v>

1689
01:33:30.541 --> 01:33:31.374
<v Speaker 1>accurately embodied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then I would also say one other </v>

1690
01:33:33.331 --> 01:33:34.164
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what I like about the </v>

1691
01:33:34.891 --> 01:33:36.210
<v Speaker 1>existentialists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

1692
01:33:36.810 --> 01:33:37.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1693
01:33:37.410 --> 01:33:38.243
<v Speaker 1>there's a kind of emphasis on pragmatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth among the existentialists because </v>

1694
01:33:41.341 --> 01:33:46.170
<v Speaker 1>they claim that your truth is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you should act out not merely hold.</v>

1695
01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:49.950
<v Speaker 1>Because to act out is to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a definition,</v>

1696
01:33:49.951 --> 01:33:50.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1697
01:33:50.250 --> 01:33:50.551
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1698
01:33:50.551 --> 01:33:52.470
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not precisely a proposition,</v>

1699
01:33:52.471 --> 01:33:56.970
<v Speaker 1>it's a definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I've found some things that I was</v>

1700
01:33:56.971 --> 01:34:01.971
<v Speaker 1>confident in enough into risk acting out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's what I'm doing to the best</v>

1701
01:34:03.751 --> 01:34:06.120
<v Speaker 1>of my ability and then I'm watching what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens and,</v>

1702
01:34:06.660 --> 01:34:10.620
<v Speaker 1>and I'm watching what happens if other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people act oUt the propositions and w as</v>

1703
01:34:10.621 --> 01:34:13.830
<v Speaker 1>far as I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So far so good.</v>

1704
01:34:13.890 --> 01:34:15.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1705
01:34:15.970 --> 01:34:16.803
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that my position right </v>

1706
01:34:18.961 --> 01:34:22.140
<v Speaker 1>now is to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you envied?</v>

1707
01:34:22.290 --> 01:34:26.140
<v Speaker 1>It's very stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean since september I basically be an</v>

1708
01:34:26.141 --> 01:34:31.110
<v Speaker 1>imposition of</v>
<v Speaker 1>any misTake is fatal for,</v>

1709
01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:33.340
<v Speaker 1>for all intents and purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1710
01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:36.960
<v Speaker 1>and that's very stressful to be that </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypervigilant and uh,</v>

1711
01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:38.273
<v Speaker 1>but by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the public response to what I've been </v>

1712
01:34:42.091 --> 01:34:43.960
<v Speaker 1>doing has been overwhelmingly positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1713
01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:46.640
<v Speaker 1>I've only got three pieces of hate mail </v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

1714
01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:48.330
<v Speaker 1>which just staggers me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1715
01:34:48.331 --> 01:34:50.880
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the comments on youtube for example,</v>

1716
01:34:51.140 --> 01:34:54.150
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are like 50 to one positive and I mean,</v>

1717
01:34:54.170 --> 01:34:54.840
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1718
01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:56.700
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a biased sample.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell,</v>

1719
01:34:56.701 --> 01:34:57.900
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1720
01:35:01.970 --> 01:35:02.870
<v Speaker 1>and the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1721
01:35:02.871 --> 01:35:03.704
<v Speaker 1>I'd been trying to rip holes in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas that I presented to you today for </v>

1722
01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:09.650
<v Speaker 1>really like with all my intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>capability for as long.</v>

1723
01:35:09.710 --> 01:35:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Every time I lecture I'm trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing is like,</v>

1724
01:35:12.051 --> 01:35:14.570
<v Speaker 1>is there something in this that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't got right?</v>

1725
01:35:14.990 --> 01:35:16.610
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to look for some,</v>

1726
01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:19.310
<v Speaker 1>a rock at the bottom of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1727
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:23.780
<v Speaker 1>and partly why I decided that I wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to use those damn words is because</v>

1728
01:35:23.781 --> 01:35:27.650
<v Speaker 1>I think the rock at the bottom of things</v>
<v Speaker 1>is honest speech.</v>

1729
01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:32.090
<v Speaker 1>I really believed that it seems to me to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be right and</v>

1730
01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:34.353
<v Speaker 1>that's good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll act it out and see what happens </v>

1731
01:35:36.251 --> 01:35:37.390
<v Speaker 1>as best I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1732
01:35:37.391 --> 01:35:38.224
<v Speaker 1>I'm not claiming to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not claiming to be any more honest </v>

1733
01:35:41.111 --> 01:35:42.280
<v Speaker 1>than anyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1734
01:35:42.281 --> 01:35:43.480
<v Speaker 1>Seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

1735
01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:44.663
<v Speaker 1>I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big claim to make you better </v>

1736
01:35:46.271 --> 01:35:48.370
<v Speaker 1>watch your bloody step if you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say that,</v>

1737
01:35:48.820 --> 01:35:49.653
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean I don't believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that on a speech is the pathway to </v>

1738
01:35:53.321 --> 01:35:57.850
<v Speaker 1>redemption because I do believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I know that's strange language,</v>

1739
01:35:57.851 --> 01:36:00.370
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's still,</v>

1740
01:36:00.490 --> 01:36:04.120
<v Speaker 1>it's the most accurate language for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of conceptualization.</v>

1741
01:36:04.690 --> 01:36:05.523
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1742
01:36:11.190 --> 01:36:13.460
<v Speaker 9>during your presentation,</v>
<v Speaker 9>your,</v>

1743
01:36:13.610 --> 01:36:17.790
<v Speaker 9>your emphasis is always been on the </v>
<v Speaker 9>truth.</v>

1744
01:36:17.791 --> 01:36:18.820
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

1745
01:36:19.190 --> 01:36:20.023
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the man who strays from the group to </v>

1746
01:36:23.761 --> 01:36:28.761
<v Speaker 9>find the truth and comes back to it,</v>
<v Speaker 9>etc. Oh,</v>

1747
01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:30.693
<v Speaker 9>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 9>his emphasis has been throughout on </v>

1748
01:36:33.630 --> 01:36:36.750
<v Speaker 9>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And my question is this,</v>

1749
01:36:37.590 --> 01:36:42.590
<v Speaker 9>I take it that truth is a necessary </v>
<v Speaker 9>condition for an idea being important at</v>

1750
01:36:43.050 --> 01:36:43.883
<v Speaker 9>some level.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's not at all obvious and it's a </v>

1751
01:36:45.811 --> 01:36:47.700
<v Speaker 9>sufficient condition.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

1752
01:36:47.701 --> 01:36:50.280
<v Speaker 9>some truths are surely uninteresting,</v>
<v Speaker 9>boring.</v>

1753
01:36:50.670 --> 01:36:53.820
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and others are really important.</v>

1754
01:36:54.450 --> 01:36:56.490
<v Speaker 9>And,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and in particular,</v>

1755
01:36:56.491 --> 01:36:59.150
<v Speaker 9>ideas about value.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Now,</v>

1756
01:36:59.160 --> 01:36:59.993
<v Speaker 9>I'm not sure whether you wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 9>classify claims about value as being </v>

1757
01:37:04.441 --> 01:37:08.280
<v Speaker 9>susceptible of truth or falsity.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's sort of been a long standing,</v>

1758
01:37:08.850 --> 01:37:11.280
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>questioning the philosophical world,</v>

1759
01:37:11.281 --> 01:37:12.114
<v Speaker 9>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but which is the right thing to say </v>

1760
01:37:13.681 --> 01:37:15.060
<v Speaker 9>about those,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but let's,</v>

1761
01:37:15.510 --> 01:37:19.920
<v Speaker 9>if we suppose that we include those,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it would be a way of,</v>

1762
01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:20.790
<v Speaker 9>of,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

1763
01:37:20.790 --> 01:37:23.010
<v Speaker 9>obscuring the contrast I'm pointing to </v>
<v Speaker 9>make,</v>

1764
01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:23.873
<v Speaker 9>which is surely we need an additional </v>
<v Speaker 9>variable which is the value of these </v>

1765
01:37:30.451 --> 01:37:35.451
<v Speaker 9>ideas and it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I was wondering whether you were in,</v>

1766
01:37:36.180 --> 01:37:37.013
<v Speaker 9>we're supposing that you had at least </v>
<v Speaker 9>implicitly some kind of general </v>

1767
01:37:40.441 --> 01:37:45.441
<v Speaker 9>criterion of value of that kind that </v>
<v Speaker 9>applies in your theory or whether that's</v>

1768
01:37:45.631 --> 01:37:46.430
<v Speaker 9>open ended.</v>

1769
01:37:46.430 --> 01:37:49.010
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a criteria because it didn't.</v>

1770
01:37:49.011 --> 01:37:49.844
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a fundamental question and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am talking about values rather than </v>

1771
01:37:53.450 --> 01:37:56.790
<v Speaker 1>empirical facts of which there are an </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinity right.</v>

1772
01:37:56.791 --> 01:38:00.210
<v Speaker 1>And so it's tHe application of the facts</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the problems of life.</v>

1773
01:38:00.211 --> 01:38:03.270
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem because there's a lot</v>

1774
01:38:03.271 --> 01:38:05.310
<v Speaker 1>of facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would say,</v>

1775
01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:08.150
<v Speaker 1>and I got this partly from piaget </v>
<v Speaker 1>because cpa,</v>

1776
01:38:08.190 --> 01:38:11.340
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that jumped piaget was</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to do is to understand.</v>

1777
01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:14.190
<v Speaker 1>He was actually trying to mediate </v>
<v Speaker 1>between religion and science.</v>

1778
01:38:14.191 --> 01:38:15.024
<v Speaker 1>That's what drove his entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual career and he came up with </v>

1779
01:38:18.301 --> 01:38:21.620
<v Speaker 1>this idea of the aquilla braided state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an idea I really liked,</v>

1780
01:38:21.621 --> 01:38:26.430
<v Speaker 1>so imagine two teams of five people </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuing a goal.</v>

1781
01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:27.713
<v Speaker 1>it's the same goal for both teams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but team a has been forcibly compelled </v>

1782
01:38:33.661 --> 01:38:36.990
<v Speaker 1>to attain the goal and team b is doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it voluntarily.</v>

1783
01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:41.340
<v Speaker 1>his proposition was is that in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an even in a race,</v>

1784
01:38:41.341 --> 01:38:42.174
<v Speaker 1>that was even all other things </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered that the team that was </v>

1785
01:38:44.641 --> 01:38:45.474
<v Speaker 1>composed of voluntary participants would</v>
<v Speaker 1>outperform the team that was compelled </v>

1786
01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:49.733
<v Speaker 1>and I believe that ben and he and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically said it's enforcement costs </v>

1787
01:38:52.441 --> 01:38:53.274
<v Speaker 1>that make the difference and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>compelling argument for me and so I've </v>

1788
01:38:56.731 --> 01:38:57.564
<v Speaker 1>been expanding on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Partly it's like piaget via young I </v>

1789
01:39:00.751 --> 01:39:04.140
<v Speaker 1>would say is the intellectual pathway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the,</v>

1790
01:39:04.410 --> 01:39:05.243
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proper aim for value is something </v>

1791
01:39:07.381 --> 01:39:08.214
<v Speaker 1>like what's good for me in a way that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>good for me tomorrow and next week and </v>

1792
01:39:14.371 --> 01:39:17.460
<v Speaker 1>next month and next year because </v>
<v Speaker 1>timeframe matters a lot,</v>

1793
01:39:17.970 --> 01:39:22.590
<v Speaker 1>so that's a serious constraint and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's good for me now and the future me</v>

1794
01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:25.800
<v Speaker 1>in a way that's also good for the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people around me,</v>

1795
01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:26.693
<v Speaker 1>if that's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then also broader society if that's </v>

1796
01:39:29.191 --> 01:39:30.024
<v Speaker 1>possible across multiple time frames and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of like the ultimate </v>

1797
01:39:33.181 --> 01:39:34.014
<v Speaker 1>equilibrated state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a hypothetical ideal </v>

1798
01:39:36.901 --> 01:39:38.170
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1799
01:39:41.050 --> 01:39:46.050
<v Speaker 9>a</v>
<v Speaker 9>number of things which are,</v>

1800
01:39:47.690 --> 01:39:51.540
<v Speaker 9>which are good,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that same criteria but different.</v>

1801
01:39:51.590 --> 01:39:55.720
<v Speaker 9>Lots of them,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we don't want to get it right,</v>

1802
01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:57.290
<v Speaker 9>but a sort of single criteria,</v>

1803
01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:01.660
<v Speaker 1>well I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think</v>

1804
01:40:01.690 --> 01:40:03.610
<v Speaker 9>take it to graduate and that filters </v>
<v Speaker 9>out.</v>

1805
01:40:03.790 --> 01:40:04.623
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1806
01:40:05.310 --> 01:40:06.143
<v Speaker 9>But it leaves a whole lot of it in and </v>
<v Speaker 9>that's interesting and I think that's a </v>

1807
01:40:11.391 --> 01:40:15.510
<v Speaker 9>good thing myself,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but certainly it's not obvious that that</v>

1808
01:40:15.511 --> 01:40:16.344
<v Speaker 9>wouldn't be true.</v>

1809
01:40:16.490 --> 01:40:19.880
<v Speaker 1>I think there's commonalities among the </v>
<v Speaker 1>set of solutions.</v>

1810
01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:21.673
<v Speaker 1>That's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the proposition that I'm putting </v>

1811
01:40:23.121 --> 01:40:23.954
<v Speaker 1>forward is that there are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think those would be akin to </v>

1812
01:40:26.210 --> 01:40:27.043
<v Speaker 1>young's archetypes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are commonalities across the sets </v>

1813
01:40:29.481 --> 01:40:32.810
<v Speaker 1>of solutions and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're reflective of people's,</v>

1814
01:40:33.290 --> 01:40:35.720
<v Speaker 1>I would say basic nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

1815
01:40:35.721 --> 01:40:36.554
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's partly why human beings that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are isolated and have been forever can </v>

1816
01:40:40.491 --> 01:40:43.010
<v Speaker 1>learn to trade with one another for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

1817
01:40:43.011 --> 01:40:45.200
<v Speaker 1>because they can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's,</v>

1818
01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:46.353
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are constraints built into that </v>

1819
01:40:48.951 --> 01:40:52.700
<v Speaker 1>requirement that I just described that </v>
<v Speaker 1>weed out most solutions,</v>

1820
01:40:52.820 --> 01:40:54.220
<v Speaker 1>which also I think the answer</v>

1821
01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:55.053
<v Speaker 3>to the postmodern dilemma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is well because you're kind of </v>

1822
01:40:57.311 --> 01:40:58.300
<v Speaker 3>posing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is well,</v>

1823
01:40:58.301 --> 01:41:01.180
<v Speaker 3>how do you know there isn't an </v>
<v Speaker 3>indefinite number of solutions.</v>

1824
01:41:01.181 --> 01:41:04.360
<v Speaker 3>And I would say because the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1825
01:41:04.380 --> 01:41:05.213
<v Speaker 3>the constraints on the solution space </v>
<v Speaker 3>are so intense that very few variance </v>

1826
01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:12.280
<v Speaker 3>manage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you make a big mistake,</v>

1827
01:41:12.281 --> 01:41:15.350
<v Speaker 3>your dad or people or people gang up on </v>
<v Speaker 3>you or like you know,</v>

1828
01:41:15.351 --> 01:41:16.184
<v Speaker 3>you either run into the world headlong </v>
<v Speaker 3>and parish or you transgressed against </v>

1829
01:41:20.681 --> 01:41:23.590
<v Speaker 3>your fellow people and they are not very</v>
<v Speaker 3>happy about that.</v>

1830
01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:28.800
<v Speaker 3>And so the set of solutions that allows </v>
<v Speaker 3>you to simultaneously exist in the world</v>

1831
01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:33.190
<v Speaker 3>and in the social world for a reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 3>length of time there,</v>

1832
01:41:33.790 --> 01:41:36.820
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a very limited number of</v>
<v Speaker 3>solutions to that problem.</v>

1833
01:41:37.450 --> 01:41:42.450
<v Speaker 9>It Just seems to be</v>
<v Speaker 9>in your universe in a way that</v>

1834
01:41:50.150 --> 01:41:50.983
<v Speaker 9>restricts.</v>

1835
01:41:57.420 --> 01:41:59.180
<v Speaker 3>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1836
01:41:59.181 --> 01:42:01.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only thing I can say is that,</v>

1837
01:42:01.590 --> 01:42:06.590
<v Speaker 3>that I think there are a set of </v>
<v Speaker 3>solutions that bounded in some manner,</v>

1838
01:42:07.140 --> 01:42:07.973
<v Speaker 3>even though it may be quite large,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's still a pattern to be </v>

1839
01:42:10.471 --> 01:42:12.090
<v Speaker 3>detected among.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1840
01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:13.223
<v Speaker 3>it's like the pattern that you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>detect that unites everything that's </v>

1841
01:42:16.021 --> 01:42:17.940
<v Speaker 3>musical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1842
01:42:17.941 --> 01:42:18.774
<v Speaker 3>there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although there's very diverse forms of </v>

1843
01:42:20.491 --> 01:42:21.324
<v Speaker 3>music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something that emerges from all </v>

1844
01:42:23.191 --> 01:42:25.590
<v Speaker 3>those forms that allows you to generate </v>
<v Speaker 3>the category.</v>

1845
01:42:25.591 --> 01:42:28.620
<v Speaker 3>And I think the same is the case with </v>
<v Speaker 3>ethical behavior,</v>

1846
01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:32.760
<v Speaker 3>although even though it's subject to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>constraints of time and place as well.</v>

1847
01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:34.550
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1848
01:42:34.650 --> 01:42:35.483
<v Speaker 3>thanks very much Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was really a great presentation </v>

1849
01:42:38.041 --> 01:42:40.680
<v Speaker 3>that you've done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to end with some encouragement.</v>

1850
01:42:40.681 --> 01:42:41.514
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've looked at the extent of your </v>

1851
01:42:43.081 --> 01:42:47.130
<v Speaker 3>coverage on youtube and one of my areas </v>
<v Speaker 3>is digital media and journalism and it's</v>

1852
01:42:47.190 --> 01:42:49.560
<v Speaker 3>incredibly impressive as you probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>already know.</v>

1853
01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:50.633
<v Speaker 3>So the level of influence that you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>is really incredible and that's a good </v>

1854
01:42:54.811 --> 01:42:57.000
<v Speaker 3>thing because that brings me to my </v>
<v Speaker 3>second point.</v>

1855
01:42:57.001 --> 01:42:57.834
<v Speaker 3>I've watched a lot of your stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not embarrassing for those of us </v>

1856
01:43:02.130 --> 01:43:04.050
<v Speaker 3>who hold similar views.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great,</v>

1857
01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:05.053
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

1858
01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:06.933
<v Speaker 3>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1859
01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:08.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am definitely.</v>

1860
01:43:09.780 --> 01:43:10.613
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there are a lot of people who </v>

1861
01:43:12.301 --> 01:43:15.180
<v Speaker 3>espouse similar views and they give me </v>
<v Speaker 3>shivers.</v>

1862
01:43:15.181 --> 01:43:17.220
<v Speaker 3>They get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they make me sick to my stomach a bit,</v>

1863
01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:22.170
<v Speaker 3>but you haven't embarrassed us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me and that's good.</v>

1864
01:43:22.171 --> 01:43:23.004
<v Speaker 3>And secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen that you have moderated even </v>

1865
01:43:24.961 --> 01:43:29.961
<v Speaker 3>your approach as saying the same things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you become even more erudite and the</v>

1866
01:43:31.231 --> 01:43:32.064
<v Speaker 3>way that you present your arguments and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I really appreciate the effort that </v>

1867
01:43:35.491 --> 01:43:36.324
<v Speaker 3>you're putting into this because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of places that you've been and </v>

1868
01:43:39.850 --> 01:43:41.700
<v Speaker 3>the number of shows that you've appeared</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

1869
01:43:41.701 --> 01:43:42.534
<v Speaker 3>I know must be very tax taxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I want to just acknowledge that </v>

1870
01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:47.873
<v Speaker 3>you're doing this not for your own good </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I really the effort that you're </v>

1871
01:43:52.101 --> 01:43:52.934
<v Speaker 3>putting into this because this is a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of personal effort that you've expended </v>

1872
01:43:57.380 --> 01:43:58.670
<v Speaker 3>and I really appreciate it.</v>

1873
01:43:59.450 --> 01:44:04.450
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>

1874
01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:06.690
<v Speaker 3>Because this is the question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The question is,</v>

1875
01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:09.180
<v Speaker 3>I've heard a story everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the question is this,</v>

1876
01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:10.433
<v Speaker 3>I keep hearing people say if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and these are my colleagues who are </v>

1877
01:44:12.571 --> 01:44:16.500
<v Speaker 3>cowards incidentally who say if only he </v>
<v Speaker 3>were nicer.</v>

1878
01:44:17.730 --> 01:44:21.240
<v Speaker 3>And you've mentioned that already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you really think that an honestly,</v>

1879
01:44:21.241 --> 01:44:23.790
<v Speaker 3>this is the question then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do we need to be nicer?</v>

1880
01:44:23.850 --> 01:44:26.110
<v Speaker 3>Do you need to be nicer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What really?</v>

1881
01:44:26.490 --> 01:44:27.940
<v Speaker 3>Just the response to that if you would.</v>

1882
01:44:30.210 --> 01:44:31.043
<v Speaker 1>I need to be nicer when it's necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be nice and not nicer when it isn't </v>

1883
01:44:34.441 --> 01:44:37.980
<v Speaker 1>and I need to learn to distinguish those</v>
<v Speaker 1>more carefully,</v>

1884
01:44:37.981 --> 01:44:40.860
<v Speaker 1>continually more carefully and ho </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically.</v>

1885
01:44:40.861 --> 01:44:41.694
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting better at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that my job isn't at stake at </v>

1886
01:44:44.881 --> 01:44:49.050
<v Speaker 1>the moment actually does take some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the agitation pressure off.</v>

1887
01:44:49.051 --> 01:44:49.884
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1888
01:44:50.010 --> 01:44:53.190
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning of this I was quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>embattled,</v>

1889
01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:55.560
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also less</v>

1890
01:44:57.240 --> 01:45:02.240
<v Speaker 1>accustomed to this crazy sequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>events and so,</v>

1891
01:45:03.241 --> 01:45:05.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know exactly what I was doing,</v>

1892
01:45:05.821 --> 01:45:07.980
<v Speaker 1>not that I do now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>

1893
01:45:08.170 --> 01:45:11.010
<v Speaker 1>and I'm more resigned to it in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense as well,</v>

1894
01:45:11.011 --> 01:45:14.010
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not trying to present myself as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1895
01:45:14.420 --> 01:45:15.253
<v Speaker 1>I don't regard what's happened to me as </v>
<v Speaker 1>any sort of calamity even though it's </v>

1896
01:45:18.031 --> 01:45:22.500
<v Speaker 1>very complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has its own momentum and,</v>

1897
01:45:22.700 --> 01:45:25.770
<v Speaker 1>and that's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

1898
01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:27.930
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to</v>

1899
01:45:29.820 --> 01:45:34.050
<v Speaker 1>weave my way through this with the least</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of enmity possible.</v>

1900
01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:35.513
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's something you have to </v>

1901
01:45:36.181 --> 01:45:41.181
<v Speaker 1>continually feel out and hopefully </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's working better.</v>

1902
01:45:41.940 --> 01:45:42.773
<v Speaker 1>That's the plan.</v>

1903
01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:50.080
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>
