1
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.970
<v Speaker 1>She said that she found out he almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a higher tolerance</v>

2
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.310
<v Speaker 1>baseline and they had the same increase </v>
<v Speaker 1>in production and sensitivity</v>

3
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.410
<v Speaker 1>and then they had lower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was lower.</v>

4
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.810
<v Speaker 1>What's critical is to find out how heart</v>
<v Speaker 1>rate</v>

5
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.270
<v Speaker 1>split,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also important.</v>

6
00:00:45.271 --> 00:00:50.271
<v Speaker 1>It's not as important because there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>response and some of the</v>

7
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.800
<v Speaker 1>more frequent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more common</v>

8
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.093
<v Speaker 1>complex negative emotions like </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment and guilt and hatred and </v>

9
00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:14.920
<v Speaker 1>cruelty and the argument basically and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

10
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when animals are afraid of the unknown,</v>

11
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.480
<v Speaker 1>but for human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fear is,</v>

12
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.433
<v Speaker 1>is increased by the fact that we also </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstractly understanding is since what </v>

13
00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:36.570
<v Speaker 1>the unknown means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

14
00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:40.740
<v Speaker 1>the mere fact that we can abstract out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know she liked the unknown as such,</v>

15
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.293
<v Speaker 1>certainly isn't indicative of the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that our cognitive processes are </v>

16
00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:50.100
<v Speaker 1>somewhat different than the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from those of animals and I,</v>

17
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.360
<v Speaker 1>I tried to show using examples drawn </v>
<v Speaker 1>from both genesis and the story of the,</v>

18
00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.370
<v Speaker 1>the fall of the Buddhists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

19
00:01:59.371 --> 00:02:04.371
<v Speaker 1>that mythology or some myths anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>present us with a story that says</v>

20
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.073
<v Speaker 1>that the development of self </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is tantamount to the </v>

21
00:02:10.351 --> 00:02:11.184
<v Speaker 1>contamination of existence with death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the logic behind that basically </v>

22
00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:21.261
<v Speaker 1>is that the defining feature of self </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is knowledge of borders,</v>

23
00:02:21.661 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our own personal borders and the most</v>

24
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.530
<v Speaker 1>tangible and horrifying of those borders</v>
<v Speaker 1>is our own knowledge of our mortality.</v>

25
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:31.734
<v Speaker 1>So in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the fact that we can see into the </v>

26
00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:34.614
<v Speaker 1>future and know what that future means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say in a sentence if </v>

27
00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:41.520
<v Speaker 1>you want to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanical about it,</v>

28
00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:42.354
<v Speaker 1>that for human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every aspect of existence serves as a </v>

29
00:02:45.061 --> 00:02:46.230
<v Speaker 1>cue for punishment.</v>

30
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.603
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone commented last week that if you </v>

31
00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:54.924
<v Speaker 1>put an animal into an experimental </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation where it's subjected </v>

32
00:02:58.321 --> 00:03:03.321
<v Speaker 1>constantly to unavoidable punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that develops learned helplessness,</v>

33
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:05.464
<v Speaker 1>which is not alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that depression can also produce </v>

34
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.060
<v Speaker 1>aggression as a consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration of such punishment.</v>

35
00:03:11.061 --> 00:03:11.894
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know already that the purpose of </v>

36
00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:16.774
<v Speaker 1>group identification is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>provide stability in an ocean of </v>

37
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:24.400
<v Speaker 1>instability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what we've now added to this,</v>

38
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:26.680
<v Speaker 1>I think with this additional line of </v>
<v Speaker 1>argumentation is</v>

39
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.793
<v Speaker 1>more clear understanding of how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just how terrible the ocean of </v>

40
00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:35.410
<v Speaker 1>instability is for human beings in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular.</v>

41
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:41.723
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>

42
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.570
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said before,</v>

43
00:03:45.571 --> 00:03:46.404
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not just interested in figuring out </v>

44
00:03:47.671 --> 00:03:50.970
<v Speaker 1>why animals defend their territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings and animals,</v>

45
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.463
<v Speaker 1>at least in terms of that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested in why we go that final </v>

46
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.153
<v Speaker 1>extra date of distance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that not only do we will we </v>

47
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:00.653
<v Speaker 1>kill to protect our territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'll engage in all sorts of </v>

48
00:04:03.031 --> 00:04:06.240
<v Speaker 1>murderous torture along the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems gratuitous in a sense,</v>

49
00:04:06.241 --> 00:04:07.074
<v Speaker 1>is that you like it's one thing to one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eliminate your enemy and we understand </v>

50
00:04:10.141 --> 00:04:11.700
<v Speaker 1>some of the motivations for doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

51
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.440
<v Speaker 1>someone who's foreign disrupts your </v>
<v Speaker 1>predictability.</v>

52
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Predictability is the essence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>security.</v>

53
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.110
<v Speaker 1>It's another thing to</v>

54
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.340
<v Speaker 2>Choo Choo.</v>

55
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.891
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

56
00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:24.724
<v Speaker 1>to make you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess to make it an aesthetic of his </v>

57
00:04:25.991 --> 00:04:30.991
<v Speaker 1>cruelty tend to pursue the opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 1>to inflict suffering on someone else</v>

58
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.400
<v Speaker 1>justified by your express patriotism </v>
<v Speaker 1>expressly,</v>

59
00:04:38.471 --> 00:04:42.010
<v Speaker 1>but obviously motivated by something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's more twisted and perverse.</v>

60
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.943
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the core question that this </v>

61
00:04:48.401 --> 00:04:51.550
<v Speaker 1>course is trying to address this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it that makes people like that?</v>

62
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.520
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just patriotic but totalitarian,</v>

63
00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.750
<v Speaker 1>patriotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not just willing to defend borders,</v>

64
00:05:00.751 --> 00:05:01.584
<v Speaker 1>but also</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated to enjoy that construction of </v>

65
00:05:07.501 --> 00:05:08.334
<v Speaker 1>cruelty for its own sake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to read you a quote from </v>

66
00:05:11.371 --> 00:05:12.204
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn to just start this off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is his description of the </v>

67
00:05:16.561 --> 00:05:17.394
<v Speaker 1>degradation of the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real version as opposed to the </v>

68
00:05:20.461 --> 00:05:21.510
<v Speaker 1>mythological version.</v>

69
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.420
<v Speaker 1>Soldier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn quotes and Arthur who says,</v>

70
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:27.783
<v Speaker 1>I was told how executions were carried </v>
<v Speaker 1>out at a doc who was the camp on the </v>

71
00:05:31.291 --> 00:05:32.124
<v Speaker 1>mature river.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would take the opposition members </v>

72
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:36.683
<v Speaker 1>with their things out of the camp </v>
<v Speaker 1>compound on a prisoner transport at </v>

73
00:05:40.591 --> 00:05:45.450
<v Speaker 1>night and outside the compound stood the</v>
<v Speaker 1>small house of the third section.</v>

74
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.553
<v Speaker 1>The condemned men were taken into a room</v>
<v Speaker 1>one at a time and were the camp guards </v>

75
00:05:49.411 --> 00:05:52.410
<v Speaker 1>sprang on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their mouths were stuffed with something</v>

76
00:05:52.411 --> 00:05:55.320
<v Speaker 1>soft and their arms were bound with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>courts behind their backs.</v>

77
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.000
<v Speaker 1>They were led out into the where </v>
<v Speaker 1>harnessed carts were waiting.</v>

78
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.313
<v Speaker 1>The bound prisoners were piled on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cards from five to seven at a time and </v>

79
00:06:02.841 --> 00:06:07.220
<v Speaker 1>driven off to the Gorkha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the camp cemetery on arrival.</v>

80
00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:10.490
<v Speaker 1>They were tipped into big pits that had </v>
<v Speaker 1>already been prepared and buried alive.</v>

81
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.390
<v Speaker 1>No one out of brutality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

82
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:20.110
<v Speaker 1>it had been ascertained rationally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when dragging and lifting them,</v>

83
00:06:20.811 --> 00:06:22.610
<v Speaker 1>it was much easier to cope with living </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

84
00:06:22.611 --> 00:06:23.444
<v Speaker 1>Then with corpses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the work land on for many nights at a </v>

85
00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:26.594
<v Speaker 1>deck and social and it's and says that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is how the moral political unity of our </v>

86
00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:32.120
<v Speaker 1>party was achieved.</v>

87
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.843
<v Speaker 1>Helipad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's described the degradation of the </v>

88
00:06:41.561 --> 00:06:42.394
<v Speaker 1>state from the mythological perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says as well be known since the </v>

89
00:06:48.551 --> 00:06:53.350
<v Speaker 1>compilation is made by our Andre h use </v>
<v Speaker 1>ner and Jg Fraser,</v>

90
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:59.250
<v Speaker 1>the delusion is almost universally </v>
<v Speaker 1>disseminated and is documented in all of</v>

91
00:06:59.531 --> 00:07:04.531
<v Speaker 1>the continents of a rarely in Africa and</v>
<v Speaker 1>on various cultural levels.</v>

92
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.560
<v Speaker 1>A certain number of variants seemed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be the result of dissemination,</v>

93
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.280
<v Speaker 1>first from Mesopotamia and then from </v>
<v Speaker 1>India.</v>

94
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.593
<v Speaker 1>It is equally possible that one or more </v>
<v Speaker 1>one or several actual dilulio </v>

95
00:07:16.751 --> 00:07:19.420
<v Speaker 1>catastrophes gave rise to fabulous </v>
<v Speaker 1>narratives,</v>

96
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.050
<v Speaker 1>but it would be risky to explain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So widespread myth by phenomena of which</v>

97
00:07:23.051 --> 00:07:25.450
<v Speaker 1>know geologic and traces have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>found.</v>

98
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.580
<v Speaker 1>The majority of the flood myth Siemens </v>
<v Speaker 1>sends to form part of the cosmic rhythm.</v>

99
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.133
<v Speaker 1>The old world people by a fallen </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity is submerged under the waters </v>

100
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:41.170
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes later a new world emerges </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the aquatic chaos.</v>

101
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.760
<v Speaker 1>While you're all familiar with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>general model,</v>

102
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.153
<v Speaker 1>you've seen that over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over again and the diagrams </v>

103
00:07:52.031 --> 00:07:55.090
<v Speaker 1>that I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>presented to,</v>

104
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.780
<v Speaker 1>it's just basically this notion</v>

105
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:15.580
<v Speaker 1>people have fallen humanity down by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>water who then reemerge.</v>

106
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:21.420
<v Speaker 1>That's the story of Noah for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then he goes on to say,</v>

107
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:23.463
<v Speaker 1>this is very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really worth thinking about </v>

108
00:08:24.761 --> 00:08:26.120
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

109
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.093
<v Speaker 1>I think it's worth thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess this past and struck me because </v>

110
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:31.773
<v Speaker 1>it echoed long after I thought up what </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you today what I had </v>

111
00:08:34.751 --> 00:08:35.584
<v Speaker 1>in fact thought up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was that you can't say that a </v>

112
00:08:39.641 --> 00:08:43.780
<v Speaker 1>state gets rotten and corrupt all on its</v>
<v Speaker 1>own,</v>

113
00:08:43.781 --> 00:08:47.080
<v Speaker 1>although that happens merely as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the passing of time,</v>

114
00:08:47.081 --> 00:08:48.910
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

115
00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.970
<v Speaker 1>let's take the analogy of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

116
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:58.290
<v Speaker 1>We all have childhood at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those personalities,</v>

117
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:02.310
<v Speaker 1>theoretically or healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given our status as children,</v>

118
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:06.120
<v Speaker 1>but as time passed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which basically meant as changed,</v>

119
00:09:06.121 --> 00:09:06.954
<v Speaker 1>continued to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we transformed from children and </v>

120
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.140
<v Speaker 1>adolescents.</v>

121
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:11.483
<v Speaker 1>And that meant that the childhood </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality considered as something </v>

122
00:09:15.061 --> 00:09:15.894
<v Speaker 1>static would have turned pathological by</v>
<v Speaker 1>its own devices as we transformed into </v>

123
00:09:21.211 --> 00:09:22.044
<v Speaker 1>adolescence because the attitude of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>child over were appropriate for a child </v>

124
00:09:24.961 --> 00:09:25.794
<v Speaker 1>is not appropriate for an adolescent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that added points out </v>

125
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.240
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

126
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:34.910
<v Speaker 1>that's an idea of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

127
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.740
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the aging and senility of the cake.</v>

128
00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:38.923
<v Speaker 1>Is that an idea that's good at one point</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your life may become pathological at </v>

129
00:09:42.691 --> 00:09:44.790
<v Speaker 1>a later point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's sort of,</v>

130
00:09:44.791 --> 00:09:47.040
<v Speaker 1>it's just a consequence of entropy in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

131
00:09:47.041 --> 00:09:47.874
<v Speaker 1>Things always change and as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence you have to run to keep up </v>

132
00:09:50.191 --> 00:09:51.440
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then really had,</v>

133
00:09:51.441 --> 00:09:55.380
<v Speaker 1>he takes the argument a bit farther and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he says in a large number of variants,</v>

134
00:09:55.950 --> 00:10:00.270
<v Speaker 1>the flood is a result of the sins or </v>
<v Speaker 1>ritual faults of human beings.</v>

135
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:01.943
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it results simply from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wish of a divine being to putting in to </v>

136
00:10:04.741 --> 00:10:07.470
<v Speaker 1>mankind will know his story is very much</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

137
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:10.283
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chief causes seem to lie at once in </v>

138
00:10:12.781 --> 00:10:15.630
<v Speaker 1>the sins of men and the decrepitude of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

139
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:17.310
<v Speaker 1>So Elliot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

140
00:10:17.311 --> 00:10:18.144
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just a matter of the fact that </v>

141
00:10:19.081 --> 00:10:22.440
<v Speaker 1>things age and become decayed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

142
00:10:22.441 --> 00:10:23.274
<v Speaker 1>but there's an additional twist on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that there's some contribution </v>

143
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.233
<v Speaker 1>according to the mythological mode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking of the misbehavior of human </v>

144
00:10:29.701 --> 00:10:30.534
<v Speaker 1>beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but makes the guard so upset they can't </v>

145
00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:33.264
<v Speaker 1>stand the noise so to speak anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They decided to do away with everything </v>

146
00:10:36.061 --> 00:10:39.510
<v Speaker 1>that's being created.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's an,</v>

147
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.433
<v Speaker 1>there's a sin of commission as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>an act of omission that leads to the </v>

148
00:10:44.791 --> 00:10:47.560
<v Speaker 1>decrepitude of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>

149
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.800
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the mere fact that it exists,</v>

150
00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:50.783
<v Speaker 1>that is that it lives in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>produces the cosmos gradually </v>

151
00:10:52.591 --> 00:10:54.840
<v Speaker 1>deteriorates and ends by falling into </v>
<v Speaker 1>decay.</v>

152
00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.690
<v Speaker 1>This is why it has to be recreated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recreated.</v>

153
00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:59.453
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flood realizes on the macrocosmic </v>

154
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:03.840
<v Speaker 1>scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is symbolic effected during the New</v>

155
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.673
<v Speaker 1>Year Festival?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The end of the world and the end of the </v>

156
00:11:06.811 --> 00:11:11.070
<v Speaker 1>sinful humanity in order to make a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>creation possible.</v>

157
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:13.363
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think about the myth that we </v>

158
00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:19.910
<v Speaker 1>discussed a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Egyptian myth that underlies the The</v>

159
00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:25.530
<v Speaker 1>Sun God status of the Pharaoh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the myth of Ocirus horrocks.</v>

160
00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:26.963
<v Speaker 1>Remember ocirus ends up being sent to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the underworld because of the treachery </v>

161
00:11:30.391 --> 00:11:34.770
<v Speaker 1>of his brother Seth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the Egyptian myth states.</v>

162
00:11:34.771 --> 00:11:35.604
<v Speaker 1>Clearly he didn't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Egyptian myth states was that </v>

163
00:11:41.581 --> 00:11:43.950
<v Speaker 1>first there was something fishy about </v>
<v Speaker 1>seth.</v>

164
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.053
<v Speaker 1>And second of all that he had such great</v>
<v Speaker 1>impact on our stairs because well </v>

165
00:11:48.701 --> 00:11:49.534
<v Speaker 1>serious didn't understand what seth was </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that meant basically is trying to </v>

166
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.910
<v Speaker 1>point out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak to people that</v>

167
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.260
<v Speaker 1>if you don't understand what evil is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will defeat you.</v>

168
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:04.953
<v Speaker 1>And so what we're trying to do from at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least in this lecture and more or less </v>

169
00:12:09.551 --> 00:12:13.120
<v Speaker 1>for the last three lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to come to some understanding of just</v>

170
00:12:13.121 --> 00:12:13.954
<v Speaker 1>what evil consists of so that we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>decrease the likelihood that it will in </v>

171
00:12:17.981 --> 00:12:18.814
<v Speaker 1>fact defeat us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was showing this manuscript to a </v>

172
00:12:22.961 --> 00:12:23.794
<v Speaker 1>friend of mine on the weekend and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>found parts of the argument that I was </v>

173
00:12:29.651 --> 00:12:30.251
<v Speaker 1>making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should,</v>

174
00:12:30.251 --> 00:12:31.084
<v Speaker 1>I'm outline I gave you last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of unsettling in a sense because I </v>

175
00:12:36.461 --> 00:12:37.294
<v Speaker 1>use a lot of terminology that's being </v>
<v Speaker 1>classically associated with the </v>

176
00:12:39.891 --> 00:12:41.910
<v Speaker 1>religious thought I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I,</v>

177
00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.960
<v Speaker 1>you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this disturbs me as well.</v>

178
00:12:43.961 --> 00:12:45.790
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least it did.</v>

179
00:12:45.791 --> 00:12:47.320
<v Speaker 1>As I was putting the manuscript </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

180
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.183
<v Speaker 1>because I had never was inclined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought of my own accord to gravitate </v>

181
00:12:53.471 --> 00:12:54.304
<v Speaker 1>towards religious language</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he asked me why I insisted upon </v>

182
00:12:59.561 --> 00:13:00.394
<v Speaker 1>using words like evil when they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>this historical context that at least </v>

183
00:13:04.961 --> 00:13:08.080
<v Speaker 1>places that partially into the domain of</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious thinking.</v>

184
00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

185
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:15.063
<v Speaker 1>it would certainly make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I changed the terminology and </v>

186
00:13:19.751 --> 00:13:20.584
<v Speaker 1>deemphasize the mythological language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could certainly make the sorts of </v>

187
00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:28.360
<v Speaker 1>theories that I'm trying to present more</v>
<v Speaker 1>palatable.</v>

188
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.420
<v Speaker 1>But the fact is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

189
00:13:31.421 --> 00:13:32.254
<v Speaker 1>that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mere fact that we know anything at </v>

190
00:13:35.781 --> 00:13:40.781
<v Speaker 1>all about evil is because of religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructions of precisely what evil is.</v>

191
00:13:42.431 --> 00:13:43.264
<v Speaker 1>And it would be a mistake as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence to abandon the historical </v>

192
00:13:46.721 --> 00:13:47.554
<v Speaker 1>roots of the development of the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to make discussion of it more </v>

193
00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:53.350
<v Speaker 1>palatable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing that occurred to me when I was</v>

194
00:13:53.351 --> 00:13:54.184
<v Speaker 1>reading is that you seem</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have changed their meanings somewhat </v>

195
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:04.330
<v Speaker 1>from the traditional religious sense and</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

196
00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.240
<v Speaker 1>where's your actually discuss concretely</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there?</v>

197
00:14:07.241 --> 00:14:10.210
<v Speaker 1>But the good and good general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they refer us to</v>

198
00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:17.140
<v Speaker 1>a specific moral code and evil to </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposition to the Colu.</v>

199
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:18.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

200
00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:19.763
<v Speaker 1>and not as is when for instance needs to</v>
<v Speaker 1>finish his book beyond good and evil </v>

201
00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.790
<v Speaker 1>refers to propose to them in that sense.</v>

202
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:26.920
<v Speaker 1>In other words that you're beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that split,</v>

203
00:14:26.921 --> 00:14:27.754
<v Speaker 1>but then what Derryn Brian curb as good </v>
<v Speaker 1>and evil is sort of beyond the </v>

204
00:14:31.481 --> 00:14:33.910
<v Speaker 1>traditional grid enable these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

205
00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:34.763
<v Speaker 1>It's description of good and evil as </v>
<v Speaker 1>processes rather than as as things are </v>

206
00:14:38.301 --> 00:14:39.760
<v Speaker 1>estates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

207
00:14:39.761 --> 00:14:43.900
<v Speaker 1>I was reading a little bit about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>French Revolution this morning because I</v>

208
00:14:43.901 --> 00:14:48.430
<v Speaker 1>referred to it in this manuscript </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere or said that the French during</v>

209
00:14:48.431 --> 00:14:52.430
<v Speaker 1>the French revolution erected a statue </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the goddess of Notradame Cathedral,</v>

210
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.550
<v Speaker 1>which I was thought was already telling </v>
<v Speaker 1>historical then that's wrong by the way.</v>

211
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.090
<v Speaker 1>They actually a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they actually dressed up an opera singer</v>

212
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.193
<v Speaker 1>at to represent the goddess of liberty </v>
<v Speaker 1>and created her around inside the </v>

213
00:15:03.801 --> 00:15:04.634
<v Speaker 1>notradame cathedral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they had renamed the temple the </v>

214
00:15:07.731 --> 00:15:08.564
<v Speaker 1>temple of reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had my remembrance of the </v>

215
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.193
<v Speaker 1>historical factors a little bit off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the basic notion is still remains </v>

216
00:15:15.321 --> 00:15:16.910
<v Speaker 1>absolutely solid.</v>

217
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:20.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean the people who ran the French </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution were in fact,</v>

218
00:15:20.931 --> 00:15:21.764
<v Speaker 1>at least in the initial stages of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution were out to to replace </v>

219
00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catholicism with,</v>

220
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:31.520
<v Speaker 1>with rational atheism and to enshrine </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

221
00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:32.723
<v Speaker 1>And it was interesting to read some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that they have done because </v>

222
00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.030
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

223
00:15:38.031 --> 00:15:38.864
<v Speaker 1>that our notion of natural rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>formally derives in large part from the </v>

224
00:15:43.731 --> 00:15:44.564
<v Speaker 1>work that was done by certain people </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the time of the French </v>

225
00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:47.493
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what was really interesting about </v>

226
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:49.423
<v Speaker 1>those authors is that having constructed</v>
<v Speaker 1>their explicit description of natural </v>

227
00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:55.154
<v Speaker 1>rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they immediately made the presumption </v>

228
00:15:56.901 --> 00:15:57.734
<v Speaker 1>that they had invented the concepts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no historical basis for the </v>

229
00:16:02.481 --> 00:16:07.481
<v Speaker 1>idea in a sense that there was no </v>
<v Speaker 1>lengthy process of religious development</v>

230
00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:11.000
<v Speaker 1>that led up to the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>positing something like a natural.</v>

231
00:16:11.001 --> 00:16:13.110
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So once having discovered it,</v>

232
00:16:13.111 --> 00:16:15.350
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say having made it explicit,</v>

233
00:16:15.351 --> 00:16:19.400
<v Speaker 1>they were willing to dispense entirely </v>
<v Speaker 1>with all of the historical prerequisites</v>

234
00:16:19.401 --> 00:16:20.690
<v Speaker 1>for the development of that idea.</v>

235
00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:22.003
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was the idea here is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say you come up with a rational </v>

236
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:28.640
<v Speaker 1>explication of the notion of a natural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

237
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:33.880
<v Speaker 1>Well that's based on on an immensely </v>
<v Speaker 1>long and complex history of the movement</v>

238
00:16:37.251 --> 00:16:38.084
<v Speaker 1>of the sorts of behavior patterns that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are encoded in the idea of national </v>

239
00:16:42.831 --> 00:16:46.250
<v Speaker 1>rights up this hierarchy of abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

240
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:49.123
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point is is that as soon as the </v>

241
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.943
<v Speaker 1>French thinkers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're able to make the notion of the </v>

242
00:16:53.181 --> 00:16:54.014
<v Speaker 1>national right explicit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were willing to dispense with the </v>

243
00:16:56.301 --> 00:16:57.134
<v Speaker 1>historical precursors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I'm using that argument </v>

244
00:16:58.581 --> 00:17:02.000
<v Speaker 1>is because I'm trying to make the notion</v>
<v Speaker 1>of evil explicit and I'm,</v>

245
00:17:02.001 --> 00:17:04.880
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not willing to dispense with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>historical precursors.</v>

246
00:17:04.881 --> 00:17:05.714
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's absolutely obvious to me that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only reason that I can say anything </v>

247
00:17:08.271 --> 00:17:09.104
<v Speaker 1>at all about evil is because all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas that I'm describing how are </v>

248
00:17:12.561 --> 00:17:17.120
<v Speaker 1>already played out at all these more </v>
<v Speaker 1>implicit levels of analysis.</v>

249
00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.890
<v Speaker 1>And what I'm trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

250
00:17:18.891 --> 00:17:22.670
<v Speaker 1>the thing is about mythological modes of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

251
00:17:22.671 --> 00:17:25.430
<v Speaker 1>These natural categories is that they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>have really,</v>

252
00:17:25.431 --> 00:17:30.431
<v Speaker 1>really fuzzy boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when you consider this structure,</v>

253
00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:33.183
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every one of these levels of analysis </v>

254
00:17:34.731 --> 00:17:39.170
<v Speaker 1>has a negative and a positive valence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's very easy for us to,</v>

255
00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:43.753
<v Speaker 1>it's very easy for us to make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition that given that the </v>

256
00:17:46.851 --> 00:17:47.990
<v Speaker 1>devil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

257
00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:52.980
<v Speaker 1>is something negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That all of the things that we regard as</v>

258
00:17:52.981 --> 00:17:57.420
<v Speaker 1>negatively vaillant emotionally belong </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the category of the devil.</v>

259
00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:59.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a very easy mistake to make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

260
00:17:59.461 --> 00:18:00.900
<v Speaker 1>so it's easy for us to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

261
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.040
<v Speaker 1>the foreigner like good is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

262
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.810
<v Speaker 1>adherence to a particular creed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

263
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:10.853
<v Speaker 1>and foreigners obviously presented a </v>
<v Speaker 1>threat to the integrity of that creed </v>

264
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:15.803
<v Speaker 1>that threatens negatively valence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's reasonable to lump everything </v>

265
00:18:19.141 --> 00:18:21.420
<v Speaker 1>natively valence into the same category.</v>

266
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:22.403
<v Speaker 1>The category that we lumped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that's active and negatively </v>

267
00:18:24.781 --> 00:18:29.250
<v Speaker 1>valence into is equivalent to the devil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you get a perfectly reasonable</v>

268
00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:33.780
<v Speaker 1>logical train that leads to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonization of enemies.</v>

269
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elaine Paige Mills who just wrote a book</v>

270
00:18:35.671 --> 00:18:39.360
<v Speaker 1>on the on the Devil said that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual,</v>

271
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:43.650
<v Speaker 1>she actually I think reversed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational change.</v>

272
00:18:43.651 --> 00:18:44.484
<v Speaker 1>She said the reason that what </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity has come up with what I </v>

273
00:18:46.471 --> 00:18:50.010
<v Speaker 1>think is the most well elaborated story </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the devil and what,</v>

274
00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:51.383
<v Speaker 1>although there are other religions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have done the same sort of thing and </v>

275
00:18:52.991 --> 00:18:55.890
<v Speaker 1>certainly the notion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nature of evil is a preoccupation of</v>

276
00:18:55.891 --> 00:18:56.724
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of moral systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in terms of elaborating up a </v>

277
00:18:58.921 --> 00:19:01.200
<v Speaker 1>dramatic figure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity has done a very good job of</v>

278
00:19:01.201 --> 00:19:02.034
<v Speaker 1>that page will says the underground </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation for the construction of such </v>

279
00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:08.250
<v Speaker 1>a figure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the personification of evil,</v>

280
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.233
<v Speaker 1>was to aid Christians in labeling their </v>
<v Speaker 1>enemies as demonic and justifying their </v>

281
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:14.490
<v Speaker 1>their annihilation.</v>

282
00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:15.593
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

283
00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:16.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a,</v>

284
00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.950
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's plausible argument.</v>

285
00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.590
<v Speaker 1>Second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a potent argument.</v>

286
00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:25.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

287
00:19:25.281 --> 00:19:26.114
<v Speaker 1>it also seems fairly obvious that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>do use mythological figures that </v>

288
00:19:29.881 --> 00:19:33.760
<v Speaker 1>represent evil to and apply them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>their enemies to justify their,</v>

289
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:35.940
<v Speaker 1>you're not alation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you might think,</v>

290
00:19:35.941 --> 00:19:36.774
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the whole idea of evil is just a </v>

291
00:19:38.251 --> 00:19:42.150
<v Speaker 1>rationalization that we use to pursue </v>
<v Speaker 1>am's that we want to pursue.</v>

292
00:19:42.151 --> 00:19:43.260
<v Speaker 1>But I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

293
00:19:43.261 --> 00:19:44.094
<v Speaker 1>that's not exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Despite the fact that it's like Freud's </v>

294
00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.830
<v Speaker 1>comments about religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can use religion as a,</v>

295
00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:52.460
<v Speaker 1>as a neurotic defense against your </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>

296
00:19:52.461 --> 00:19:53.760
<v Speaker 1>You've death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

297
00:19:53.761 --> 00:19:54.594
<v Speaker 1>What that means is that you identify </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a given creed in a dogmatic manner </v>

298
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:02.460
<v Speaker 1>and that protects you from your neurotic</v>
<v Speaker 1>stairs.</v>

299
00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.070
<v Speaker 1>Don't want from Freud's mistake as far </v>
<v Speaker 1>as I was concerned,</v>

300
00:20:05.071 --> 00:20:05.904
<v Speaker 1>was to take a perfectly reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>observation and turn it into universal </v>

301
00:20:08.821 --> 00:20:09.420
<v Speaker 1>statement.</v>

302
00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:10.253
<v Speaker 1>The statement being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the only possible purpose of </v>

303
00:20:12.541 --> 00:20:13.374
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that you could miss you </v>

304
00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:15.673
<v Speaker 1>something does not necessarily mean that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the misuse of the thing is the only use </v>

305
00:20:19.501 --> 00:20:20.334
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While I'm the same applies to the ideas </v>

306
00:20:22.081 --> 00:20:22.914
<v Speaker 1>of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that having a figure at your </v>

307
00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:30.750
<v Speaker 1>disposal like the devil so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes it easier for you in some ways to,</v>

308
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:31.913
<v Speaker 1>to represent your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your enemies as reprehensible does not </v>

309
00:20:34.561 --> 00:20:35.394
<v Speaker 1>necessarily mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only reason that such a </v>

310
00:20:37.951 --> 00:20:38.784
<v Speaker 1>figure developed and when I'm trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do in this manuscript and this lecture </v>

311
00:20:41.731 --> 00:20:46.731
<v Speaker 1>today is to clarify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to bring some clarity to these fuzzy,</v>

312
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:52.240
<v Speaker 1>mythological categories so that we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>draw a clear distinction between,</v>

313
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:53.283
<v Speaker 1>well what I would say our idols of evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are necessarily false and the </v>

314
00:20:58.481 --> 00:20:59.314
<v Speaker 1>process of evil itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is actually clearly </v>

315
00:21:02.021 --> 00:21:02.854
<v Speaker 1>identifiable and stable across cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like all these other things that </v>

316
00:21:06.371 --> 00:21:09.770
<v Speaker 1>we've discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

317
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:12.550
<v Speaker 1>Anyone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes?</v>

318
00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:13.620
<v Speaker 1>How could you talk about evil?</v>

319
00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

320
00:21:16.961 --> 00:21:17.794
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can talk about it by all sorts of </v>

321
00:21:18.551 --> 00:21:22.910
<v Speaker 1>other names I guess like in humanity </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be one or uh,</v>

322
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:24.003
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

323
00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:25.293
<v Speaker 1>we do it in psychology all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talk about antisocial behavior where </v>

324
00:21:28.421 --> 00:21:29.254
<v Speaker 1>we talked about psychopathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopathy being the thing that's most </v>

325
00:21:32.201 --> 00:21:35.560
<v Speaker 1>closely related in the clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature to classical notions of evil.</v>

326
00:21:35.561 --> 00:21:36.394
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we say like standard theories </v>

327
00:21:38.381 --> 00:21:40.360
<v Speaker 1>of antisocial behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

328
00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.550
<v Speaker 1>and I know I know this literature </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively well,</v>

329
00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:44.830
<v Speaker 1>they're usually motive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're based on,</v>

330
00:21:44.831 --> 00:21:45.664
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on inference is drawn from analysis of </v>

331
00:21:49.811 --> 00:21:50.644
<v Speaker 1>lower level of motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you might say that the typical </v>

332
00:21:52.991 --> 00:21:53.824
<v Speaker 1>antisocial person is someone who's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>high in sensitivity to incentive reward </v>

333
00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:01.960
<v Speaker 1>and very low in sensitivity to threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a standard theory for anti social</v>

334
00:22:01.961 --> 00:22:05.110
<v Speaker 1>motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means that they're all goal,</v>

335
00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:06.003
<v Speaker 1>all curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all novelty seeking and very little </v>

336
00:22:08.261 --> 00:22:09.094
<v Speaker 1>stock.</v>

337
00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:09.993
<v Speaker 1>You can't make the managers so they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have inhibitory control over the </v>

338
00:22:12.011 --> 00:22:13.120
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

339
00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.890
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty mechanistic notion of,</v>

340
00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:18.460
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what underlies criminal behavior in a</v>

341
00:22:18.461 --> 00:22:21.190
<v Speaker 1>lot of research has been being devoted </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards that.</v>

342
00:22:21.191 --> 00:22:22.024
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of being the standard </v>

343
00:22:23.051 --> 00:22:23.884
<v Speaker 1>antisocial personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who just doesn't feel anxiety </v>

344
00:22:26.441 --> 00:22:27.274
<v Speaker 1>very clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who can't use cues of punishment to </v>

345
00:22:30.431 --> 00:22:32.500
<v Speaker 1>regulate their own behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

346
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.033
<v Speaker 1>there the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any wrong with </v>

347
00:22:36.821 --> 00:22:37.654
<v Speaker 1>that line of theorizing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are probably underlying </v>

348
00:22:40.901 --> 00:22:45.570
<v Speaker 1>motivation reasons that might propel </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's neurotically inclined,</v>

349
00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:46.413
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards criminality rather than towards </v>

350
00:22:47.711 --> 00:22:48.544
<v Speaker 1>agoraphobic or eating disorders or all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other things that can complicate up </v>

351
00:22:50.681 --> 00:22:51.514
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what that's missing is any </v>

352
00:22:53.981 --> 00:22:54.814
<v Speaker 1>appreciation for the fact that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the activities that we regard as </v>

353
00:22:57.131 --> 00:22:57.964
<v Speaker 1>criminal deeply criminal have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect of almost an aesthetic aspect in </v>

354
00:23:03.001 --> 00:23:03.834
<v Speaker 1>a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is obvious desire to wreak havoc </v>

355
00:23:06.761 --> 00:23:07.594
<v Speaker 1>and harm on someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not merely for whatever gain might be </v>

356
00:23:10.031 --> 00:23:10.864
<v Speaker 1>caused by that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but very often despite the fact that no </v>

357
00:23:14.411 --> 00:23:19.060
<v Speaker 1>gain whatsoever will be cost by just for</v>
<v Speaker 1>participating in the act itself.</v>

358
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some exceptions to this,</v>

359
00:23:20.801 --> 00:23:21.634
<v Speaker 1>like Dan always who studies bullying in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavian countries the most </v>

360
00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.570
<v Speaker 1>particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's always been interested in.</v>

361
00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:30.940
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that motivated his </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifetime's work on,</v>

362
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.720
<v Speaker 1>on bullying is understanding of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian personality because he's,</v>

363
00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:35.853
<v Speaker 1>he makes the presupposition that bullies</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their henchmen or the juvenile </v>

364
00:23:40.121 --> 00:23:42.340
<v Speaker 1>versions of fascists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascists,</v>

365
00:23:42.341 --> 00:23:43.174
<v Speaker 1>and their louts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a perfectly reasonable </v>

366
00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.830
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis as far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's documented instances.</v>

367
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:50.060
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has a video tape,</v>

368
00:23:50.061 --> 00:23:50.894
<v Speaker 1>which I haven't seen him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just read this description of it that </v>

369
00:23:53.001 --> 00:23:54.350
<v Speaker 1>shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

370
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:59.090
<v Speaker 1>it's being taken in a public school in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Norway showing a group of bullies,</v>

371
00:23:59.091 --> 00:23:59.924
<v Speaker 1>tormenting a whipping boy basically by </v>
<v Speaker 1>tying a string around his neck and </v>

372
00:24:04.011 --> 00:24:04.844
<v Speaker 1>leading them through the hallways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about that sort of thing </v>

373
00:24:06.651 --> 00:24:10.160
<v Speaker 1>is that it's fun and it's that aspect </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

374
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:11.323
<v Speaker 1>of the attractiveness of engaging in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of behavior that we really </v>

375
00:24:14.301 --> 00:24:16.880
<v Speaker 1>haven't been able to get our finger on </v>
<v Speaker 1>very clearly in psychology.</v>

376
00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:20.210
<v Speaker 1>And I think as a rule we tend to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we tend to sidestep it.</v>

377
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:23.570
<v Speaker 1>And it's also because we don't like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with issues like equal,</v>

378
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:24.703
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have these sorts of religious </v>

379
00:24:25.791 --> 00:24:26.624
<v Speaker 1>overtones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you're talking about the sorts </v>

380
00:24:27.921 --> 00:24:31.700
<v Speaker 1>of things that happened in concentration</v>
<v Speaker 1>camps in the Soviet Union in Germany,</v>

381
00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:34.190
<v Speaker 1>which are the sorts of things I'm really</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in,</v>

382
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:36.583
<v Speaker 1>you have to use the strongest work you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have at your disposal to describe those </v>

383
00:24:39.351 --> 00:24:43.280
<v Speaker 1>patterns of activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also the case that,</v>

384
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:45.470
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned last week,</v>

385
00:24:45.471 --> 00:24:46.304
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of the prior order </v>
<v Speaker 1>surviving Nazis were prosecuted after </v>

386
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:53.150
<v Speaker 1>the Second World War for crimes against </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity,</v>

387
00:24:53.151 --> 00:24:53.984
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

388
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.823
<v Speaker 1>which is a category of moral violation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we recognize at a sort of super </v>

389
00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:00.080
<v Speaker 1>cultural level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that we say,</v>

390
00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:01.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

391
00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:02.563
<v Speaker 1>morality is culture bound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that different cultures </v>

392
00:25:05.211 --> 00:25:06.070
<v Speaker 1>have different rules.</v>

393
00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.640
<v Speaker 1>If you follow those rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

394
00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:10.790
<v Speaker 1>you're responsible within the confines </v>
<v Speaker 1>of those cultures.</v>

395
00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:12.013
<v Speaker 1>But despite that relativistic morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are certain activities that you </v>

396
00:25:15.741 --> 00:25:19.460
<v Speaker 1>can't engage in no matter what your </v>
<v Speaker 1>excuses and basically what that,</v>

397
00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:20.383
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thesis of the Nuremberg </v>

398
00:25:21.351 --> 00:25:22.184
<v Speaker 1>trials basically in that thesis is </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicated on implicit recognition at </v>

399
00:25:25.641 --> 00:25:26.474
<v Speaker 1>least that there's a form of morality </v>
<v Speaker 1>that supersedes cultural identification </v>

400
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:30.463
<v Speaker 1>and also one that a form of morality and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a form of immorality that transcends </v>

401
00:25:35.661 --> 00:25:38.060
<v Speaker 1>cultural identification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't believe that,</v>

402
00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.900
<v Speaker 1>then it's difficult to justify any </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief that you might have.</v>

403
00:25:41.901 --> 00:25:44.240
<v Speaker 1>That what happened in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

404
00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:45.253
<v Speaker 1>did constitute a crime against humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to regard the Nuremberg </v>

405
00:25:48.741 --> 00:25:50.870
<v Speaker 1>trials as an act of revenge by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>victors,</v>

406
00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:53.390
<v Speaker 1>which is an arguable position</v>

407
00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.380
<v Speaker 3>question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just wondering,</v>

408
00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:59.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to understand the context of </v>
<v Speaker 3>mental health.</v>

409
00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.110
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm wondering,</v>

410
00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:03.030
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

411
00:26:03.031 --> 00:26:03.864
<v Speaker 3>like mental health itself can be defined</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the idea of mental health and need </v>

412
00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:11.730
<v Speaker 3>find this like survival or cooperation </v>
<v Speaker 3>in society or whether it's like,</v>

413
00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:13.813
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can itself like can have disturbed </v>

414
00:26:16.291 --> 00:26:20.240
<v Speaker 3>person achieves to a high level of </v>
<v Speaker 3>success.</v>

415
00:26:20.241 --> 00:26:22.650
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hitler did and still be considered.</v>

416
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:24.880
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

417
00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:25.900
<v Speaker 1>that's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

418
00:26:25.901 --> 00:26:28.890
<v Speaker 1>I said one of the questions that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been trying to answer all along here,</v>

419
00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.470
<v Speaker 1>this neat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's in Peru,</v>

420
00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.030
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are there pathologies of health,</v>

421
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:33.903
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you be the exemplar of a given </v>

422
00:26:36.701 --> 00:26:37.534
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means by the definition of that </v>

423
00:26:39.611 --> 00:26:40.444
<v Speaker 1>society normally average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in fact and still be considered </v>

424
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:46.343
<v Speaker 1>corrupt at a higher level of analysis </v>
<v Speaker 1>whose existence can actually be </v>

425
00:26:49.801 --> 00:26:53.190
<v Speaker 1>justified in some manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is the issue.</v>

426
00:26:53.191 --> 00:26:55.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we're trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're trying to find out.</v>

427
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.903
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I read you the little story that </v>

428
00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.093
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] told about the elimination </v>
<v Speaker 1>of anomalous information in the form of </v>

429
00:27:06.451 --> 00:27:09.120
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not social instance argument.</v>

430
00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:12.360
<v Speaker 1>The social and political unity of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Communist Party says,</v>

431
00:27:12.361 --> 00:27:13.194
<v Speaker 1>how was it a tank you just eliminate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you eliminate all anomalous information </v>

432
00:27:17.611 --> 00:27:20.100
<v Speaker 1>that's actually still embodied in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

433
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:21.473
<v Speaker 1>so an idea log doesn't like contrary </v>
<v Speaker 1>rational arguments because they present </v>

434
00:27:25.261 --> 00:27:27.400
<v Speaker 1>information that violates the of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>logs,</v>

435
00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:28.243
<v Speaker 1>precept positions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the case that the mere </v>

436
00:27:29.821 --> 00:27:30.654
<v Speaker 1>existence of certain types of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of whether they're making </v>

437
00:27:32.971 --> 00:27:37.971
<v Speaker 1>their arguments in any abstract form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people indicate by their behavior,</v>

438
00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:42.820
<v Speaker 1>their objection to our existence in </v>
<v Speaker 1>spite of your particular precept.</v>

439
00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:43.653
<v Speaker 1>So they're mere fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mere fact of their existence is </v>

440
00:27:45.961 --> 00:27:48.330
<v Speaker 1>individuals and sufficient threat to </v>
<v Speaker 1>justify their,</v>

441
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.940
<v Speaker 1>their repression and annihilation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

442
00:27:50.941 --> 00:27:55.941
<v Speaker 1>well totalitarians are doing to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what abstract authoritarians due</v>

443
00:27:57.451 --> 00:27:58.284
<v Speaker 1>to ideas that don't agree with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you present me with information that </v>

444
00:28:01.471 --> 00:28:03.330
<v Speaker 1>doesn't fit my frame of reference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just</v>

445
00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:05.373
<v Speaker 2>eliminated</v>

446
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:10.783
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eliade talks about the notion of the </v>

447
00:28:12.281 --> 00:28:14.680
<v Speaker 1>flood and this University of </v>
<v Speaker 1>disseminated myth that says</v>

448
00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:19.630
<v Speaker 1>states of being are annihilated by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gods periodically,</v>

449
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:24.520
<v Speaker 1>not only because they are decrepit</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a constant,</v>

450
00:28:24.521 --> 00:28:26.560
<v Speaker 1>just as a consequence of their manner of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

451
00:28:26.561 --> 00:28:30.670
<v Speaker 1>but also because people add unnecessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>decrepitude to them by their,</v>

452
00:28:30.671 --> 00:28:32.140
<v Speaker 1>by their sins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

453
00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.420
<v Speaker 1>That's a mythological idea and we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what it means.</v>

454
00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:35.763
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to read you a little section </v>

455
00:28:37.061 --> 00:28:37.894
<v Speaker 1>that describes the authoritarianism of </v>
<v Speaker 1>an individual who I think came to </v>

456
00:28:41.621 --> 00:28:45.280
<v Speaker 1>realize that many of his so called moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>precepts,</v>

457
00:28:45.281 --> 00:28:46.114
<v Speaker 1>the things that he held as as </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological ideals were in fact leading </v>

458
00:28:50.561 --> 00:28:54.310
<v Speaker 1>him down in extraordinarily totalitarian</v>
<v Speaker 1>path.</v>

459
00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:55.823
<v Speaker 2>MMM,</v>

460
00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:58.693
<v Speaker 1>today is Christmas Day and I have just </v>
<v Speaker 1>come home from Julie's while I was </v>

461
00:29:01.881 --> 00:29:02.714
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It struck me as I sat on the couch </v>

462
00:29:04.701 --> 00:29:08.120
<v Speaker 1>between two girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just how foolish and idiotic I have been</v>

463
00:29:08.121 --> 00:29:11.570
<v Speaker 1>in this smile and we life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope you want to have patients while I</v>

464
00:29:11.571 --> 00:29:12.404
<v Speaker 1>own burden myself on you because I need </v>
<v Speaker 1>desperately to confess my sins to </v>

465
00:29:15.801 --> 00:29:16.634
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know that if I were sitting in a </v>

466
00:29:18.471 --> 00:29:20.630
<v Speaker 1>little cubicle talking to an unseen </v>
<v Speaker 1>clergymen,</v>

467
00:29:20.631 --> 00:29:21.464
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't do a proper job of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fit the definition of a religious </v>

468
00:29:24.831 --> 00:29:25.664
<v Speaker 1>man as someone who gives careful </v>
<v Speaker 1>consideration to the demonic and </v>

469
00:29:27.771 --> 00:29:31.040
<v Speaker 1>irrational and humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think you will find my confession.</v>

470
00:29:31.041 --> 00:29:31.874
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you can a grown man who </v>

471
00:29:36.261 --> 00:29:39.650
<v Speaker 1>harbors in his heart the most vicious </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment for his fellow man,</v>

472
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:42.550
<v Speaker 1>his neighbor who is actually</v>

473
00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:43.383
<v Speaker 4>guilty of nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more than embodying a superior </v>

474
00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.020
<v Speaker 4>consciousness of what it means to be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

475
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.353
<v Speaker 4>When I think of all the black scathing </v>
<v Speaker 4>thoughts I have directed at those who I </v>

476
00:29:52.361 --> 00:29:55.300
<v Speaker 4>could not look in the eye,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is almost unbearable.</v>

477
00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:57.003
<v Speaker 4>All of my lofty disdain for the common </v>
<v Speaker 4>man who so I thought it was guilty of </v>

478
00:30:01.601 --> 00:30:02.434
<v Speaker 4>the sin of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of unconsciousness was I now realize </v>

479
00:30:04.901 --> 00:30:05.734
<v Speaker 4>founded on nothing more than jealousy in</v>
<v Speaker 4>spite I hated unload anyone who had </v>

480
00:30:11.021 --> 00:30:11.854
<v Speaker 4>wrestled with their fear of leaving the </v>
<v Speaker 4>maternal confines of a childish </v>

481
00:30:14.081 --> 00:30:17.470
<v Speaker 4>mentality and won their battle only </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I had not done so.</v>

482
00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:21.770
<v Speaker 4>I equated independence and success with </v>
<v Speaker 4>ego,</v>

483
00:30:21.771 --> 00:30:25.330
<v Speaker 4>tism and selfishness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was my fondest hope,</v>

484
00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:26.253
<v Speaker 4>my highest ambition to witness and </v>
<v Speaker 4>participate in the destruction of </v>

485
00:30:29.111 --> 00:30:29.944
<v Speaker 4>everything that's successful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>independent people had built for </v>

486
00:30:31.601 --> 00:30:33.340
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

487
00:30:33.341 --> 00:30:34.174
<v Speaker 4>I consider it a duty fact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a decidedly fanatical element </v>

488
00:30:38.051 --> 00:30:42.040
<v Speaker 4>in my urge to cleanse the world of what </v>
<v Speaker 4>I perceived to be selfishness.</v>

489
00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:43.960
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

490
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:44.793
<v Speaker 4>I think of what would have happened if I</v>
<v Speaker 4>had been in a position to realize my </v>

491
00:30:47.111 --> 00:30:51.460
<v Speaker 4>fine feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The memory makes me fear that any moment</v>

492
00:30:51.461 --> 00:30:52.294
<v Speaker 4>the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll crack open and swallow me up </v>

493
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:54.543
<v Speaker 4>because if there was any justice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would I who have not the faintest </v>

494
00:30:58.271 --> 00:30:59.104
<v Speaker 4>inkling of a capacity for moral judgment</v>
<v Speaker 4>traipsing around passing judgment on </v>

495
00:31:02.321 --> 00:31:03.154
<v Speaker 4>anyone who Derek Cross my path.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes me wonder that I have even one </v>

496
00:31:06.671 --> 00:31:10.120
<v Speaker 4>friend in this world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but of course I had friends before,</v>

497
00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:14.170
<v Speaker 4>anyone with enough self contempt that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they could forgive me.</v>

498
00:31:14.171 --> 00:31:15.004
<v Speaker 4>Mine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is fortunate for humanity that there </v>

499
00:31:17.711 --> 00:31:19.870
<v Speaker 4>are a few saviors of the caliber of </v>
<v Speaker 4>myself.</v>

500
00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:22.870
<v Speaker 4>If you know that I use to identify with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Christ,</v>

501
00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:28.150
<v Speaker 4>I considered myself entirely </v>
<v Speaker 4>immaculately free of aggression in every</v>

502
00:31:28.151 --> 00:31:28.984
<v Speaker 4>other form of antisocial feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what about the hatred I have just </v>

503
00:31:33.491 --> 00:31:34.840
<v Speaker 4>now confessed you ask.</v>

504
00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:36.963
<v Speaker 4>That didn't count.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those feelings were based on sound </v>

505
00:31:39.791 --> 00:31:40.840
<v Speaker 4>common sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uc.</v>

506
00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:41.913
<v Speaker 4>After all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are sons of bitches in the world </v>

507
00:31:43.511 --> 00:31:47.830
<v Speaker 4>and one needs to be ready for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do I smell ozone?</v>

508
00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:52.420
<v Speaker 4>They say you get a tingling sensation </v>
<v Speaker 4>just before the lightning bolt strikes.</v>

509
00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:56.080
<v Speaker 4>That is a very apt phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 4>son of a bitch.</v>

510
00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:57.513
<v Speaker 4>There's a passage in young's </v>
<v Speaker 4>phenomenology of the self which runs </v>

511
00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:01.563
<v Speaker 4>often.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A mother appears beside him who </v>

512
00:32:03.371 --> 00:32:04.204
<v Speaker 4>apparently shows not the slightest </v>
<v Speaker 4>concern that her little son should </v>

513
00:32:06.101 --> 00:32:06.934
<v Speaker 4>become a man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but who was tireless in self emulating </v>

514
00:32:10.031 --> 00:32:11.170
<v Speaker 4>effort,</v>
<v Speaker 4>neglect,</v>

515
00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:15.670
<v Speaker 4>nothing that might hinder him from </v>
<v Speaker 4>growing up in marrying you.</v>

516
00:32:15.671 --> 00:32:16.504
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>behold the secret conspiracy between </v>

517
00:32:17.591 --> 00:32:20.890
<v Speaker 4>mother and son and how each helps the </v>
<v Speaker 4>other to be trade life.</v>

518
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:24.183
<v Speaker 4>This insight would be useful for me as </v>
<v Speaker 4>an excuse being a perfectly accurate </v>

519
00:32:27.551 --> 00:32:28.384
<v Speaker 4>description of my situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not for the fact that I'm almost </v>

520
00:32:31.001 --> 00:32:34.510
<v Speaker 4>daily presented with a residual bit of </v>
<v Speaker 4>undeleted evil and myself.</v>

521
00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:36.783
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I am faced with a frustrating </v>

522
00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:39.793
<v Speaker 4>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do not ask myself what I am going to </v>

523
00:32:41.391 --> 00:32:42.224
<v Speaker 4>do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I asked myself who's responsible for it </v>

524
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:48.590
<v Speaker 4>and I'm always ready to conclude that if</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other person were to ag property,</v>

525
00:32:48.591 --> 00:32:51.600
<v Speaker 4>then the problem will not exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is evil,</v>

526
00:32:51.601 --> 00:32:54.340
<v Speaker 4>the boat that you ask?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

527
00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:58.820
<v Speaker 4>obviously if I am determined to overlook</v>
<v Speaker 4>my own part in the failure to resolve my</v>

528
00:32:58.821 --> 00:33:00.210
<v Speaker 4>own frustrations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

529
00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:02.630
<v Speaker 4>if I'm determined to find a scapegoat </v>
<v Speaker 4>for my problems,</v>

530
00:33:02.631 --> 00:33:03.464
<v Speaker 4>then I'm just a stone's throw away from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the mentality that was responsible for </v>

531
00:33:05.721 --> 00:33:06.554
<v Speaker 4>Hitler's final solution or for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Spanish inquisition or for Lennon's </v>

532
00:33:09.771 --> 00:33:10.850
<v Speaker 4>cultural cleansing.</v>

533
00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:15.903
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

534
00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:19.420
<v Speaker 4>What was it you told me when I </v>
<v Speaker 4>complained about the flaws in capitalism</v>

535
00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:23.200
<v Speaker 4>about the fact that so many people take </v>
<v Speaker 4>advantage of the capitalist system,</v>

536
00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:25.143
<v Speaker 4>something like the fact that people go </v>
<v Speaker 4>on consolidating their financial </v>

537
00:33:28.481 --> 00:33:29.314
<v Speaker 4>position ad nauseum is another problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it is no reason to conclude that </v>

538
00:33:32.831 --> 00:33:33.664
<v Speaker 4>there anything virtuous in even refusing</v>
<v Speaker 4>to try to cut consolidates one's </v>

539
00:33:37.271 --> 00:33:41.800
<v Speaker 4>position in the first place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it is much easier to crown ones,</v>

540
00:33:41.801 --> 00:33:44.350
<v Speaker 4>cowardice and laziness with the accolade</v>
<v Speaker 4>of virtue.</v>

541
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.580
<v Speaker 4>Just ask Lens Henchman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He swaggered around the countryside,</v>

542
00:33:48.581 --> 00:33:53.581
<v Speaker 4>robbing every farmer who had managed any</v>
<v Speaker 4>success whatsoever and called themselves</v>

543
00:33:54.191 --> 00:33:55.024
<v Speaker 4>friends of the common people and patted </v>
<v Speaker 4>each other on the back for their moral </v>

544
00:33:57.761 --> 00:33:58.594
<v Speaker 4>uprightness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if I've actually changed so </v>

545
00:34:02.401 --> 00:34:05.880
<v Speaker 4>much that I would not join them if I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>put to the test.</v>

546
00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:08.243
<v Speaker 4>The idea that morality stems from a lack</v>
<v Speaker 4>of personal interest is thoroughly </v>

547
00:34:11.461 --> 00:34:12.294
<v Speaker 4>ingrained in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good people are those who don't want </v>

548
00:34:16.161 --> 00:34:18.590
<v Speaker 4>anything for themselves is the way I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>

549
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:20.143
<v Speaker 4>but I never asked myself why is such a </v>
<v Speaker 4>person shouldn't put any effort into </v>

550
00:34:22.941 --> 00:34:23.774
<v Speaker 4>disciplining himself or take any pains </v>
<v Speaker 4>to keep his motives clear in his own </v>

551
00:34:26.481 --> 00:34:30.500
<v Speaker 4>mind because there's nothing of value to</v>
<v Speaker 4>him in this world,</v>

552
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:35.040
<v Speaker 4>in his essay relations between the ego </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the unconscious,</v>

553
00:34:35.041 --> 00:34:37.250
<v Speaker 4>he don't says that in an unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 4>state,</v>

554
00:34:37.251 --> 00:34:38.084
<v Speaker 4>the individual's torn by the conflict of</v>
<v Speaker 4>opposites and that achieving </v>

555
00:34:41.271 --> 00:34:45.050
<v Speaker 4>consciousness involves resolving that </v>
<v Speaker 4>conflict on a higher level.</v>

556
00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:47.903
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand that this particular </v>

557
00:34:48.490 --> 00:34:49.323
<v Speaker 4>statement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cha a Dalton consciousness is different </v>

558
00:34:50.631 --> 00:34:51.464
<v Speaker 4>from the original state of childlike and</v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness in which there is no long </v>

559
00:34:53.921 --> 00:34:54.754
<v Speaker 4>term conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just last week I was stuck in that dead </v>

560
00:34:57.621 --> 00:34:58.454
<v Speaker 4>end again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was sitting and thinking about what </v>

561
00:34:59.991 --> 00:35:00.824
<v Speaker 4>course my life should be taking and had </v>
<v Speaker 4>every imagined scenario of a fulfilling </v>

562
00:35:04.191 --> 00:35:05.024
<v Speaker 4>or meaningful activity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was met by a counterpoint coming from </v>

563
00:35:07.101 --> 00:35:07.934
<v Speaker 4>somewhere in my head showing me how this</v>
<v Speaker 4>or that aspect of my scenario was wrong </v>

564
00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:14.270
<v Speaker 4>because it wouldn't result in this or </v>
<v Speaker 4>that problem.</v>

565
00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:15.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

566
00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:16.493
<v Speaker 4>To the point where it was unacceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Consider any career at all because just </v>

567
00:35:19.261 --> 00:35:21.900
<v Speaker 4>by being alive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would contribute to the destruction of</v>

568
00:35:21.901 --> 00:35:26.310
<v Speaker 4>the planet</v>
<v Speaker 4>and as badly as I want it to refute this</v>

569
00:35:26.311 --> 00:35:30.030
<v Speaker 4>echo of wrong to my every emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right as an irrational Kymera.</v>

570
00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:31.103
<v Speaker 4>The fact is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I told myself that we see daily in </v>

571
00:35:32.731 --> 00:35:34.800
<v Speaker 4>the newspapers how the activities of </v>
<v Speaker 4>humanity,</v>

572
00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:39.550
<v Speaker 4>which are also the activities of men and</v>
<v Speaker 4>women are causing and Calkin will farm.</v>

573
00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:43.123
<v Speaker 4>It is of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>due to my being influenced by yourself </v>

574
00:35:44.991 --> 00:35:48.350
<v Speaker 4>that I do not remain stuck in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>particular blog too long these days.</v>

575
00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:50.960
<v Speaker 4>If our industrialism was causing </v>
<v Speaker 4>problems,</v>

576
00:35:50.961 --> 00:35:51.794
<v Speaker 4>I know Lawrence for myself than I should</v>
<v Speaker 4>hope that there are people out there </v>

577
00:35:54.021 --> 00:35:54.854
<v Speaker 4>working to solve those problems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or perhaps I should try to do something </v>

578
00:35:57.741 --> 00:36:01.160
<v Speaker 4>about them myself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but sitting idly by,</v>

579
00:36:01.161 --> 00:36:03.260
<v Speaker 4>I do know what it's all the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>

580
00:36:03.261 --> 00:36:04.094
<v Speaker 4>what is most daunting and also most </v>
<v Speaker 4>sniffily about being stuck in that Bhag </v>

581
00:36:07.851 --> 00:36:08.684
<v Speaker 4>is the fact that the rational wide wants</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be absolutely sure about the </v>

582
00:36:10.791 --> 00:36:13.600
<v Speaker 4>successful outcome of its life plan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

583
00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:16.330
<v Speaker 4>obviously there's another part of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mind that knows that such certainties,</v>

584
00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:20.830
<v Speaker 4>impossible when has been faced with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>need to accept on faith that things will</v>

585
00:36:20.831 --> 00:36:23.260
<v Speaker 4>turn out for the better and with some </v>
<v Speaker 4>luck and perseverance.</v>

586
00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:24.300
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

587
00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:25.133
<v Speaker 4>and being a fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>upstanding modern mouse with an </v>

588
00:36:27.361 --> 00:36:28.194
<v Speaker 4>enlightened rational mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have no use for faith and other such </v>

589
00:36:30.121 --> 00:36:30.954
<v Speaker 4>religious Santa clap trap and nonsense </v>
<v Speaker 4>or faith is obviously your rational and </v>

590
00:36:34.651 --> 00:36:39.210
<v Speaker 4>all not have any here rationality </v>
<v Speaker 4>influencing my behavior previously.</v>

591
00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:40.493
<v Speaker 4>My solution to this problem was to allow</v>
<v Speaker 4>a chance to make my career choices for </v>

592
00:36:43.261 --> 00:36:44.094
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>letting my own interests influenced my </v>

593
00:36:45.331 --> 00:36:46.164
<v Speaker 4>decisions as little as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I believe that I had somehow </v>

594
00:36:49.081 --> 00:36:49.914
<v Speaker 4>avoided personal responsibility for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>state of the modern world because I was </v>

595
00:36:53.041 --> 00:36:53.874
<v Speaker 4>not really responsible for the state of </v>
<v Speaker 4>my life and that eight escape from the </v>

596
00:36:56.881 --> 00:37:00.120
<v Speaker 4>possibility that my plans wouldn't work </v>
<v Speaker 4>out because I had no plans.</v>

597
00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:02.163
<v Speaker 4>It was on this rock solid foundation </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I looked out at the world and saw </v>

598
00:37:05.141 --> 00:37:05.974
<v Speaker 4>all around me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who were stupid enough to add </v>

599
00:37:07.451 --> 00:37:08.284
<v Speaker 4>their own selves into the equation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put this kind of faith in oneself to </v>

600
00:37:13.361 --> 00:37:15.940
<v Speaker 4>believe that there exists inside of one </v>
<v Speaker 4>a motive force,</v>

601
00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:17.043
<v Speaker 4>call it an interest which will respond </v>
<v Speaker 4>to life and carry one through </v>

602
00:37:19.991 --> 00:37:23.590
<v Speaker 4>uncertainty and adversity is an </v>
<v Speaker 4>irrational attitude without equal,</v>

603
00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:25.443
<v Speaker 4>and it is with this irrational approach </v>
<v Speaker 4>to life that the conflict of opposites </v>

604
00:37:27.771 --> 00:37:29.290
<v Speaker 4>is resolved,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems to me,</v>

605
00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:32.063
<v Speaker 4>but the problem now is this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In order to have this faith in one's </v>

606
00:37:34.351 --> 00:37:35.184
<v Speaker 4>irrational nature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one needs proof that personal interests </v>

607
00:37:37.081 --> 00:37:37.914
<v Speaker 4>and passions are capable of sustaining </v>
<v Speaker 4>one through the uncertainties and </v>

608
00:37:40.081 --> 00:37:43.620
<v Speaker 4>adversities of life with the rational </v>
<v Speaker 4>mind foresee so clearly,</v>

609
00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.490
<v Speaker 4>and the only way to get that proof is to</v>
<v Speaker 4>risk one self and just see the result.</v>

610
00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:48.950
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

611
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:52.560
<v Speaker 4>It is a very exceptional person you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>take such under taking on their own.</v>

612
00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:55.800
<v Speaker 4>Most of us need guidance and support </v>
<v Speaker 4>from others,</v>

613
00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.020
<v Speaker 4>from believers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so to speak.</v>

614
00:37:58.780 --> 00:37:59.551
<v Speaker 4>Strange,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

615
00:37:59.551 --> 00:38:01.980
<v Speaker 4>That religious terms should become </v>
<v Speaker 4>useful for this discussion.</v>

616
00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.713
<v Speaker 4>As I wrote that last paragraph,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was suddenly reminded of your idea </v>

617
00:38:06.061 --> 00:38:06.894
<v Speaker 4>that the devil has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he has represented Milton's paradise </v>

618
00:38:08.551 --> 00:38:09.384
<v Speaker 4>lost is a metaphor for the rational </v>
<v Speaker 4>intellect just being placed in the </v>

619
00:38:12.361 --> 00:38:14.280
<v Speaker 4>position of the highest psychic </v>
<v Speaker 4>authority.</v>

620
00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:15.280
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

621
00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.440
<v Speaker 4>Better to rule and how then to serve in </v>
<v Speaker 4>heaven.</v>

622
00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:21.130
<v Speaker 4>Hell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dan is a condition in which the rational</v>

623
00:38:21.131 --> 00:38:21.964
<v Speaker 4>mind with its acute consciousness of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>many perils of life hold sway over the </v>

624
00:38:25.901 --> 00:38:28.630
<v Speaker 4>individual and the fact of Lee prevents </v>
<v Speaker 4>him from engaging in life,</v>

625
00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.033
<v Speaker 4>which results in the morally degenerate </v>
<v Speaker 4>state of weakness that I described in </v>

626
00:38:32.531 --> 00:38:33.850
<v Speaker 4>the first pages of his letter.</v>

627
00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:35.010
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

628
00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 1>And Heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I presume,</v>

629
00:38:35.981 --> 00:38:36.814
<v Speaker 1>would be a condition in which the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rational mind subordinates itself to </v>

630
00:38:39.251 --> 00:38:42.370
<v Speaker 1>faith in God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is God?</v>

631
00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:44.643
<v Speaker 1>You have a chapter in the manuscript of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your book towel titled The Divinity </v>

632
00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your ideas are starting to make sense to</v>

633
00:38:50.051 --> 00:38:50.884
<v Speaker 1>me now at least I think they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Faith in God means faith in that which </v>

634
00:38:54.041 --> 00:38:54.874
<v Speaker 1>Kendall's one's interest and leads one </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from the parental sphere out into </v>

635
00:38:57.971 --> 00:38:58.804
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To deny those interests is to deny God </v>

636
00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:06.280
<v Speaker 1>fall from having it land squarely in </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell where one's passions burn eternally</v>

637
00:39:06.281 --> 00:39:10.420
<v Speaker 1>and frustration was it God said when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>cast out amount of Eden,</v>

638
00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:12.323
<v Speaker 1>so I'm thinking about working in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dust at the end of his days with the </v>

639
00:39:14.291 --> 00:39:16.480
<v Speaker 1>specter of death always looming in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

640
00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:18.243
<v Speaker 1>I can certainly relate to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the most vivid impressions I get </v>

641
00:39:21.131 --> 00:39:21.964
<v Speaker 1>from recalling all those years I spent </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving from one job to the next is the </v>

642
00:39:25.121 --> 00:39:25.954
<v Speaker 1>pointlessness of my daily life back then</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the glaring knowledge that the end </v>

643
00:39:29.291 --> 00:39:30.124
<v Speaker 1>was drawing near,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I'm doing something that has </v>

644
00:39:32.471 --> 00:39:33.304
<v Speaker 1>meaning for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that interests me as I am </v>

645
00:39:35.501 --> 00:39:36.334
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>death seems far away and work seems </v>

646
00:39:38.921 --> 00:39:41.800
<v Speaker 1>quite agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even joy us.</v>

647
00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two things or more about that.</v>

648
00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:48.213
<v Speaker 1>I guess the first is that the writer of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this letter points out that the only </v>

649
00:39:54.161 --> 00:39:54.994
<v Speaker 1>thing that stopped him from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from being Hitler or Stalin for that </v>

650
00:39:59.261 --> 00:40:00.670
<v Speaker 1>matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or perhaps on where you want to,</v>

651
00:40:00.671 --> 00:40:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Hitler or stale intention was lack of </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity.</v>

652
00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:04.893
<v Speaker 1>It's not lack of will and that it's easy</v>
<v Speaker 1>for us to make the presupposition that </v>

653
00:40:08.801 --> 00:40:09.634
<v Speaker 1>there's a qualitative difference between</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like Hitler and it's our Ed of </v>

654
00:40:12.531 --> 00:40:14.920
<v Speaker 1>men or stolen and someone like </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>

655
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:16.263
<v Speaker 1>Partly because we're never in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>position to do any of the sorts of </v>

656
00:40:18.461 --> 00:40:21.930
<v Speaker 1>things that those bands did and as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence it's,</v>

657
00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:23.013
<v Speaker 1>we can use our difference in position to</v>
<v Speaker 1>support our notion that there's a </v>

658
00:40:27.251 --> 00:40:29.920
<v Speaker 1>qualitative difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he points out,</v>

659
00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:31.473
<v Speaker 1>I think this is interesting also in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of more current news about the </v>

660
00:40:37.001 --> 00:40:37.834
<v Speaker 1>unabomber because the unabomber was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person who had this sort of attitude </v>

661
00:40:41.441 --> 00:40:44.980
<v Speaker 1>that's described in this letter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that he made the presupposition</v>

662
00:40:44.981 --> 00:40:45.814
<v Speaker 1>that industrial society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>him excluded was evil and the </v>

663
00:40:49.241 --> 00:40:50.074
<v Speaker 1>appropriate thing to do was to </v>
<v Speaker 1>disassociate oneself entirely from all </v>

664
00:40:54.161 --> 00:40:59.161
<v Speaker 1>contact with that society and having </v>
<v Speaker 1>done so presume and begin to fix it from</v>

665
00:41:01.341 --> 00:41:02.770
<v Speaker 1>an outside all on his own.</v>

666
00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:06.490
<v Speaker 1>And I know in terms of psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>profiles,</v>

667
00:41:06.491 --> 00:41:09.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know what the unabomber is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>is on the outside.</v>

668
00:41:09.611 --> 00:41:14.611
<v Speaker 1>He would appear as someone who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely could we essence who would do</v>

669
00:41:15.101 --> 00:41:15.934
<v Speaker 1>anything you told him to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would never cause any trouble </v>

670
00:41:17.891 --> 00:41:18.724
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who would appear as someone who was </v>

671
00:41:20.741 --> 00:41:25.540
<v Speaker 1>actually composed almost entirely of low</v>
<v Speaker 1>self esteem and doubt,</v>

672
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:26.703
<v Speaker 1>but who deep inside believed that he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>far superior to anyone that he'd ever </v>

673
00:41:30.911 --> 00:41:31.744
<v Speaker 1>encountered on the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I mean it's from a position </v>

674
00:41:34.821 --> 00:41:35.654
<v Speaker 1>like that that you can then move rapidly</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards justification of doing things </v>

675
00:41:39.441 --> 00:41:40.274
<v Speaker 1>like blowing up in innocent people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretically partake in what you </v>

676
00:41:44.571 --> 00:41:49.571
<v Speaker 1>consider inappropriate from a distance </v>
<v Speaker 1>having severed for moral reasons.</v>

677
00:41:49.911 --> 00:41:50.744
<v Speaker 1>All possible contact with with a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>members of humanity supported in his </v>

678
00:41:56.061 --> 00:41:56.894
<v Speaker 1>endeavors theoretically from pity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>care by both his mother and his brother </v>

679
00:42:00.441 --> 00:42:03.770
<v Speaker 1>who sent him money to sustain is </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely abnormal,</v>

680
00:42:03.771 --> 00:42:07.430
<v Speaker 1>exist as long beyond the point that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have been sustainable on its own.</v>

681
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:20.103
<v Speaker 1>I also wanted to read you another </v>
<v Speaker 1>section from social [inaudible] and on </v>

682
00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:27.700
<v Speaker 1>the authoritarianism of the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the ideological,</v>

683
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:28.543
<v Speaker 1>logical version.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have the first story that </v>

684
00:42:30.701 --> 00:42:34.980
<v Speaker 1>describes the consequences of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian ideology,</v>

685
00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:35.823
<v Speaker 1>put it to action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the necessary pursuit and </v>

686
00:42:38.621 --> 00:42:41.260
<v Speaker 1>destruction of people who don't share </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideological view.</v>

687
00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:42.423
<v Speaker 1>And then we have the mythological notion</v>
<v Speaker 1>that things go from bad to worse on </v>

688
00:42:45.221 --> 00:42:46.054
<v Speaker 1>their own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people tend to help that process </v>

689
00:42:47.741 --> 00:42:49.990
<v Speaker 1>along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as a consequence now and man,</v>

690
00:42:49.991 --> 00:42:50.824
<v Speaker 1>God decides to obliterate the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we have an individual story in </v>

691
00:42:55.061 --> 00:42:55.894
<v Speaker 1>which one person who confesses that </v>
<v Speaker 1>given his presuppositions about the </v>

692
00:43:00.551 --> 00:43:02.830
<v Speaker 1>state of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had he been in any position of authority</v>

693
00:43:02.831 --> 00:43:04.900
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would've been a very terrible person.</v>

694
00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:07.840
<v Speaker 1>And in fact that he was a very terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

695
00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:09.003
<v Speaker 1>but he was also powerless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he didn't look terrible because he </v>

696
00:43:11.951 --> 00:43:13.990
<v Speaker 1>couldn't put any of his fantasies into </v>
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>

697
00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:16.030
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do thing,</v>

698
00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:16.893
<v Speaker 1>this is what separates most of us from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the position that someone like Hitler </v>

699
00:43:19.511 --> 00:43:20.344
<v Speaker 1>found himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I do actually believe that that </v>

700
00:43:22.751 --> 00:43:27.751
<v Speaker 1>Hitler was not</v>
<v Speaker 1>a particularly pathological individual.</v>

701
00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:29.733
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

702
00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:35.410
<v Speaker 1>He had a decent first world war record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his sort of aimless wandering throughout</v>

703
00:43:36.861 --> 00:43:37.694
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the close of world war one or that </v>

704
00:43:39.711 --> 00:43:40.544
<v Speaker 1>much different from the aimless </v>
<v Speaker 1>wandering of any number of hundreds of </v>

705
00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:45.013
<v Speaker 1>thousands of men who'd be unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 1>brutalized in trench warfare during </v>

706
00:43:48.321 --> 00:43:49.190
<v Speaker 1>World War One.</v>

707
00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.033
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

708
00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:51.861
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is,</v>

709
00:43:51.861 --> 00:43:52.694
<v Speaker 1>it's not to say that a man in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>position was without faults because he </v>

710
00:43:55.671 --> 00:43:57.800
<v Speaker 1>certainly had as many faults as the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>person did.</v>

711
00:43:57.801 --> 00:44:01.130
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is is that no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

712
00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:04.130
<v Speaker 1>if you put yourself into a position of </v>
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>

713
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:09.550
<v Speaker 1>what you forego is the sort of social </v>
<v Speaker 1>feedback that keeps most people in line.</v>

714
00:44:09.571 --> 00:44:10.610
<v Speaker 1>So you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

715
00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:13.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the average individual is composed of</v>

716
00:44:13.071 --> 00:44:13.904
<v Speaker 1>a certain amount,</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive qualities and a certain amount </v>

717
00:44:15.501 --> 00:44:18.950
<v Speaker 1>of negative qualities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but being relatively powerless,</v>

718
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.863
<v Speaker 1>the average person has always kept in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind by the social pressure of his or </v>

719
00:44:22.491 --> 00:44:24.680
<v Speaker 1>her peers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for any of us,</v>

720
00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:25.693
<v Speaker 1>theoretically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we start to move too far in our </v>

721
00:44:28.821 --> 00:44:32.280
<v Speaker 1>naturally pathological direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we receive instant.</v>

722
00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:34.553
<v Speaker 1>We receive instant feedback from our </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounding environment suggesting that </v>

723
00:44:37.351 --> 00:44:39.480
<v Speaker 1>it might be better if we want a fire </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>

724
00:44:39.481 --> 00:44:43.800
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that people have enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>courage to be irritated by us and let us</v>

725
00:44:43.801 --> 00:44:44.634
<v Speaker 1>know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or people have enough courage or aren't </v>

726
00:44:46.231 --> 00:44:47.064
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently terrified of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the same thing in a sense to </v>

727
00:44:49.831 --> 00:44:53.910
<v Speaker 1>tell us when we've gone too far out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>wine by gesture and look and interaction</v>

728
00:44:53.911 --> 00:44:54.780
<v Speaker 1>and all sorts of things.</v>

729
00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:55.980
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all,</v>

730
00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:56.903
<v Speaker 1>we all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the security that the </v>

731
00:44:58.531 --> 00:45:00.170
<v Speaker 1>social group provides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

732
00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:03.810
<v Speaker 1>a social group makes everyone else </v>
<v Speaker 1>predictable,</v>

733
00:45:03.811 --> 00:45:04.644
<v Speaker 1>but it also keeps us predictable to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourself to by ensuring that we told the </v>

734
00:45:07.531 --> 00:45:08.364
<v Speaker 1>line the problem with accruing power in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the manner of someone like Hitler is </v>

735
00:45:11.401 --> 00:45:14.070
<v Speaker 1>that you forego all that social </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrective feedback.</v>

736
00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:15.353
<v Speaker 1>And then because you surround yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>by people and it's a process that feeds </v>

737
00:45:18.451 --> 00:45:19.284
<v Speaker 1>back onto itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you surround yourself by people who are </v>

738
00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:24.600
<v Speaker 1>essentially cowardly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who want to hide behind your charisma,</v>

739
00:45:24.601 --> 00:45:25.434
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that they don't have to face the </v>

740
00:45:26.911 --> 00:45:27.744
<v Speaker 1>world and they're willing because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect them from the things they don't </v>

741
00:45:30.091 --> 00:45:32.850
<v Speaker 1>want to look at to exceed to your every </v>
<v Speaker 1>wish.</v>

742
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Now in some ways that can be perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive.</v>

743
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.983
<v Speaker 1>I read a good biography of Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that claimed that had he quit </v>

744
00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:46.920
<v Speaker 1>or being killed or died in the mid </v>
<v Speaker 1>thirties that the judgment of the German</v>

745
00:45:46.921 --> 00:45:47.754
<v Speaker 1>people and perhaps of history overall </v>
<v Speaker 1>would he'd be in the pain of being a </v>

746
00:45:50.341 --> 00:45:51.420
<v Speaker 1>very effective leader.</v>

747
00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:52.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might debate,</v>

748
00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:56.690
<v Speaker 1>perhaps it's debatable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't read every biography of Hitler</v>

749
00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:57.533
<v Speaker 1>that's out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem was that as things </v>

750
00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:05.220
<v Speaker 1>continue to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as his power continued to grow,</v>

751
00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:07.860
<v Speaker 1>his pathology had a wider and wider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wider,</v>

752
00:46:07.861 --> 00:46:10.470
<v Speaker 1>wider latitude for expression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

753
00:46:10.471 --> 00:46:12.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question really becomes,</v>

754
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.073
<v Speaker 1>so you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's comforting that there's a </v>

755
00:46:14.401 --> 00:46:17.700
<v Speaker 1>qualitative difference between someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Hitler and the person who's sitting</v>

756
00:46:17.701 --> 00:46:20.730
<v Speaker 1>next to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you also have to think when the</v>

757
00:46:20.731 --> 00:46:25.731
<v Speaker 1>whole country of people think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the answer to all their problems,</v>

758
00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:27.820
<v Speaker 1>what sort of character and what it take </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

759
00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:29.213
<v Speaker 1>to tell yourself that all those people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are wrong given especially in say </v>

760
00:46:32.701 --> 00:46:33.534
<v Speaker 1>inhibitors case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The exceptional odds against him have </v>

761
00:46:35.641 --> 00:46:38.940
<v Speaker 1>ever him having ever gone to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>position that he got to.</v>

762
00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:42.000
<v Speaker 1>He was a pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was trivial person from a,</v>

763
00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:45.150
<v Speaker 1>from a socioeconomic and military </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

764
00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:46.313
<v Speaker 1>He didn't come from a powerful family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had no influential friends to speak </v>

765
00:46:49.171 --> 00:46:50.004
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he climbed up the ranks of the </v>

766
00:46:51.061 --> 00:46:54.030
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy unit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remarkable manner and you know,</v>

767
00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:54.923
<v Speaker 1>gain the gain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the democratic acceptance of the vast </v>

768
00:46:57.301 --> 00:46:58.134
<v Speaker 1>majority of the German population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he also viewed himself as someone </v>

769
00:47:01.141 --> 00:47:04.410
<v Speaker 1>who was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany's only hope,</v>

770
00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:08.250
<v Speaker 1>partly as a bolt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he viewed himself as a bulwark from</v>

771
00:47:08.251 --> 00:47:10.080
<v Speaker 1>the encroachment of communism from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>East,</v>

772
00:47:10.081 --> 00:47:10.914
<v Speaker 1>which was a real threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also someone who could conceivably </v>

773
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:18.060
<v Speaker 1>restored Germany to some of the power </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had been stripped from,</v>

774
00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:20.940
<v Speaker 1>from the country by diverse side </v>
<v Speaker 1>trading,</v>

775
00:47:20.941 --> 00:47:21.774
<v Speaker 1>which I think is reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's reasonable to comment on that </v>

776
00:47:23.971 --> 00:47:28.971
<v Speaker 1>training that it was blatantly vengeful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'll have to ask yourself,</v>

777
00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:30.610
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under those conditions,</v>

778
00:47:30.611 --> 00:47:31.444
<v Speaker 1>given,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given that much admiration carried out </v>

779
00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:35.613
<v Speaker 1>over such a lengthy period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many people wouldn't fall prey to </v>

780
00:47:38.831 --> 00:47:40.060
<v Speaker 1>their own pathologies?</v>

781
00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:43.740
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Blending very interesting.</v>

782
00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:47.590
<v Speaker 5>Sort of enjoyed as much personal powers </v>
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>

783
00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:52.900
<v Speaker 5>You have to seem to have a discipline to</v>
<v Speaker 5>survive.</v>

784
00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:54.760
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

785
00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:55.593
<v Speaker 5>Some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it makes it because the hip or </v>

786
00:47:57.781 --> 00:48:00.090
<v Speaker 5>pattern is much more common.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

787
00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:01.673
<v Speaker 5>Then the wake on these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just curious when you think about </v>

788
00:48:06.301 --> 00:48:07.134
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

789
00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:08.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

790
00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:10.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly what to think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

791
00:48:10.841 --> 00:48:11.674
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps here it's just surprisingly </v>

792
00:48:13.421 --> 00:48:16.660
<v Speaker 1>lacking anthropologist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's one possibility.</v>

793
00:48:16.661 --> 00:48:20.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was also explicitly religious.</v>

794
00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:25.960
<v Speaker 1>He had engaged in also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always thought personal incentives.</v>

795
00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

796
00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:29.860
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that was part of it.</v>

797
00:48:29.861 --> 00:48:32.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was willing voluntarily to </v>
<v Speaker 1>four gold,</v>

798
00:48:32.741 --> 00:48:35.440
<v Speaker 1>many of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rewards that he might've otherwise,</v>

799
00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:36.453
<v Speaker 1>I guess basically what he did was to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to discipline himself so that he </v>

800
00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:44.320
<v Speaker 1>as a matter of habit would reject any </v>
<v Speaker 1>temptation that was offered to him.</v>

801
00:48:44.321 --> 00:48:45.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did some strange things,</v>

802
00:48:45.671 --> 00:48:46.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

803
00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:50.770
<v Speaker 1>or things that seem strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think like I remember that Gandhi used</v>

804
00:48:50.771 --> 00:48:55.771
<v Speaker 1>to sleep with young women in order to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to attempt to suppress his sexual desire</v>

805
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.971
<v Speaker 1>grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

806
00:48:57.971 --> 00:48:58.900
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

807
00:48:58.901 --> 00:49:00.490
<v Speaker 1>well that's kind of a strange thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

808
00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:01.301
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

809
00:49:01.301 --> 00:49:02.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

810
00:49:02.051 --> 00:49:06.160
<v Speaker 1>here's someone who is like absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounded by temptations of every sort,</v>

811
00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:07.893
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in any direction that he would have </v>

812
00:49:08.711 --> 00:49:12.110
<v Speaker 1>chosen to pursue whatever he wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would have been granted it.</v>

813
00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:13.323
<v Speaker 1>And perhaps the only way he could keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself vaguely on course was to forego </v>

814
00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:18.693
<v Speaker 1>all of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the temporal attractions of his </v>

815
00:49:20.381 --> 00:49:23.940
<v Speaker 1>power as powerful position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think again,</v>

816
00:49:23.941 --> 00:49:27.640
<v Speaker 1>the perhaps had prepared himself for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of things that he might encounter,</v>

817
00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:30.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beforehand.</v>

818
00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:30.903
<v Speaker 1>And he engaged in a lengthy letter </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing correspondence with tolstoy </v>

819
00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:36.940
<v Speaker 1>before he started his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his nonviolent movement in India.</v>

820
00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:41.050
<v Speaker 1>I also suspect that maybe as his power </v>
<v Speaker 1>grew,</v>

821
00:49:41.051 --> 00:49:41.884
<v Speaker 1>his character grew too because he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>making the right decisions all the way </v>

822
00:49:44.321 --> 00:49:46.430
<v Speaker 1>along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

823
00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:47.273
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was offered a small temptation </v>

824
00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:51.250
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps he was able to say no.</v>

825
00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:52.960
<v Speaker 1>And then the next time when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>temptation,</v>

826
00:49:52.961 --> 00:49:54.000
<v Speaker 1>the slight be bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

827
00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it got easier.</v>

828
00:49:55.691 --> 00:49:57.740
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something that was practice.</v>

829
00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We may be confusing situations here.</v>

830
00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:03.573
<v Speaker 1>I think you can apply the same analysis </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you used for Hitler in terms of </v>

831
00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:06.813
<v Speaker 1>Gandhi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His,</v>

832
00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:07.743
<v Speaker 1>the reason why he was powerful is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you enable to resist these </v>

833
00:50:10.211 --> 00:50:11.044
<v Speaker 1>temptations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as you accumulated power and </v>

834
00:50:13.211 --> 00:50:17.170
<v Speaker 1>accumulated power as a saint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not as a political leader in a sense,</v>

835
00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:18.860
<v Speaker 1>is there a lot of political leaders in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indian?</v>

836
00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:20.133
<v Speaker 1>So you're suggesting too that there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>social pressure on him to keep him on </v>

837
00:50:23.471 --> 00:50:25.630
<v Speaker 1>the positive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the positive direction as well.</v>

838
00:50:25.631 --> 00:50:26.530
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

839
00:50:26.531 --> 00:50:27.800
<v Speaker 1>well I think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

840
00:50:27.801 --> 00:50:28.634
<v Speaker 1>if everyone expects you to act like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>saint as well then and you're going to </v>

841
00:50:32.211 --> 00:50:33.250
<v Speaker 1>have to have a moral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

842
00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:34.011
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

843
00:50:34.011 --> 00:50:36.230
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean certainly these sorts of feedback</v>

844
00:50:36.231 --> 00:50:37.580
<v Speaker 1>processes exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

845
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:38.833
<v Speaker 1>that's why I said there's this statement</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the new testament run something like </v>

846
00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:44.840
<v Speaker 1>to those who have everything more shall </v>
<v Speaker 1>be given to those who have nothing.</v>

847
00:50:44.841 --> 00:50:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Everything will be taken away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do I think that is?</v>

848
00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:48.173
<v Speaker 1>His description of this sort of feedback</v>
<v Speaker 1>process is that one good decision </v>

849
00:50:51.891 --> 00:50:55.340
<v Speaker 1>heightens the likelihood of the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>good decision and so on and so forth.</v>

850
00:50:55.341 --> 00:50:57.620
<v Speaker 1>So invent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you make your decisions,</v>

851
00:50:57.621 --> 00:50:59.390
<v Speaker 1>events conspire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

852
00:50:59.391 --> 00:51:00.224
<v Speaker 1>to reinforce them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see this with paranoids like </v>

853
00:51:02.601 --> 00:51:04.070
<v Speaker 1>Stella.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

854
00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:07.340
<v Speaker 1>if you're paranoid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think everyone's out to get you well</v>

855
00:51:07.341 --> 00:51:09.520
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that you're very hostile and</v>

856
00:51:09.521 --> 00:51:10.354
<v Speaker 1>suspicious towards people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that you see their dark </v>

857
00:51:12.171 --> 00:51:13.004
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also makes them very afraid and </v>

858
00:51:14.481 --> 00:51:17.340
<v Speaker 1>suspicious of you so you can see you </v>
<v Speaker 1>very [inaudible].</v>

859
00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:18.081
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

860
00:51:18.081 --> 00:51:20.120
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing could spiral out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>control very,</v>

861
00:51:20.121 --> 00:51:22.220
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dealt with that.</v>

862
00:51:22.590 --> 00:51:25.710
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just one of the really intriguing things</v>

863
00:51:25.711 --> 00:51:30.050
<v Speaker 5>about God</v>
<v Speaker 5>as well as the same,</v>

864
00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:33.660
<v Speaker 5>which is sort of an unusual combination.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there are many who,</v>

865
00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:35.820
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as far as his sainthood,</v>

866
00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:40.500
<v Speaker 5>we turn out not to be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean witness Ben tollerene evangelists</v>

867
00:51:40.501 --> 00:51:41.334
<v Speaker 5>and all that specific claim to authority</v>
<v Speaker 5>is being holier than the rest of us who </v>

868
00:51:45.411 --> 00:51:46.244
<v Speaker 5>then ultimately turn out to be that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's still something very </v>

869
00:51:49.111 --> 00:51:53.060
<v Speaker 5>extraordinary about this personal </v>
<v Speaker 5>discipline or whatever it was</v>

870
00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:56.840
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

871
00:51:58.130 --> 00:52:00.020
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you had sex with young women,</v>

872
00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:01.610
<v Speaker 6>you're not calling that?</v>

873
00:52:01.610 --> 00:52:01.970
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

874
00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:04.820
<v Speaker 1>He just slept beside that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beside that.</v>

875
00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

876
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

877
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:10.370
<v Speaker 1>and then to heighten his ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>resist,</v>

878
00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:11.610
<v Speaker 1>that was his theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

879
00:52:11.611 --> 00:52:12.444
<v Speaker 1>who knows.</v>

880
00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:13.393
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what do you think of the difference </v>

881
00:52:14.341 --> 00:52:15.174
<v Speaker 6>between like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the sort of second process of denying </v>

882
00:52:17.521 --> 00:52:18.354
<v Speaker 6>the temptation versus like sort of </v>
<v Speaker 6>denying other people's idea of like in </v>

883
00:52:21.061 --> 00:52:23.880
<v Speaker 6>both the same sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>similar in like you're saying,</v>

884
00:52:24.490 --> 00:52:25.323
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm acknowledging some part of me and </v>

885
00:52:27.961 --> 00:52:28.794
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

886
00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:29.790
<v Speaker 6>they're both thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

887
00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.400
<v Speaker 6>not acknowledging some,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pardon me,</v>

888
00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:32.253
<v Speaker 6>like</v>

889
00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:34.330
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a difference between refusing to</v>

890
00:52:34.331 --> 00:52:35.164
<v Speaker 1>acknowledge something and technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but picking a particular course of </v>

891
00:52:38.741 --> 00:52:39.574
<v Speaker 1>action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I may say say we're in involved in </v>

892
00:52:41.651 --> 00:52:44.320
<v Speaker 1>a heated discussion and you make me </v>
<v Speaker 1>angry.</v>

893
00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:45.573
<v Speaker 1>I mean the appropriate response on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>part is to recognize the fact that I am </v>

894
00:52:48.991 --> 00:52:49.824
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I am angry and north to pretend </v>

895
00:52:51.671 --> 00:52:53.770
<v Speaker 1>that I'm knowing because good people </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get angry.</v>

896
00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:55.990
<v Speaker 1>But then once having recognized the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact,</v>

897
00:52:55.991 --> 00:52:56.824
<v Speaker 1>choose that pattern of behavior that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel is appropriate under those </v>

898
00:52:59.021 --> 00:53:00.940
<v Speaker 1>circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which might be to say,</v>

899
00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:01.983
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd better stop having this discussion </v>

900
00:53:03.221 --> 00:53:07.000
<v Speaker 1>because I am in fact getting angry or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you might say something like,</v>

901
00:53:07.570 --> 00:53:08.403
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for reasons I don't understand entirely </v>

902
00:53:10.571 --> 00:53:12.580
<v Speaker 1>what you're saying is really irritating </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

903
00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:16.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know necessarily where the ducks</v>
<v Speaker 1>up an appropriate reaction or not,</v>

904
00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:21.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's really the one that I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the sort of thing it was actually</v>

905
00:53:21.101 --> 00:53:22.200
<v Speaker 1>put to some therapeutic can</v>

906
00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:24.840
<v Speaker 5>you just fight people like Carl Rogers </v>
<v Speaker 5>cause he used to do that sort of thing.</v>

907
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:26.993
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a matter of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the pretense that the </v>

908
00:53:29.911 --> 00:53:30.744
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable fact doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's choosing to deal with it in some </v>

909
00:53:35.581 --> 00:53:36.414
<v Speaker 1>conscious man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means planned manner once it's </v>

910
00:53:38.761 --> 00:53:39.700
<v Speaker 1>actually manifest.</v>

911
00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:42.633
<v Speaker 6>One other thing that you mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 6>before we hit like most of the leaders </v>

912
00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:46.313
<v Speaker 6>seem to charismatic because they seem </v>
<v Speaker 6>like they were unified in that like </v>

913
00:53:49.621 --> 00:53:52.410
<v Speaker 6>different president personality all sort</v>
<v Speaker 6>of fit together well.</v>

914
00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:53.953
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say now that you've been about </v>

915
00:53:54.411 --> 00:53:55.244
<v Speaker 1>someone like Hitler.</v>

916
00:53:56.010 --> 00:53:57.680
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean if somebody's</v>

917
00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:01.890
<v Speaker 6>in that way to differently,</v>
<v Speaker 6>depending on whether you follow all your</v>

918
00:54:01.891 --> 00:54:02.724
<v Speaker 6>temptations and death,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like all your names of set as satisfied </v>

919
00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:05.513
<v Speaker 6>or</v>

920
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:08.440
<v Speaker 1>he just said when nature discuss </v>
<v Speaker 1>morality,</v>

921
00:54:08.441 --> 00:54:10.420
<v Speaker 1>he said that most morality was </v>
<v Speaker 1>cowardice,</v>

922
00:54:10.421 --> 00:54:12.700
<v Speaker 1>which basically meant that it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people were good,</v>

923
00:54:12.701 --> 00:54:13.534
<v Speaker 1>it was just that they were far too </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid to act on those motivations but </v>

924
00:54:15.941 --> 00:54:16.774
<v Speaker 1>actually propelled them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the motivations were there and </v>

925
00:54:19.781 --> 00:54:23.230
<v Speaker 1>that given the opportunity with no with </v>
<v Speaker 1>no chance of</v>

926
00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:25.363
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>

927
00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:27.570
<v Speaker 1>punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would act them out.</v>

928
00:54:27.571 --> 00:54:29.490
<v Speaker 1>And you see this sort of behavior in </v>
<v Speaker 1>riots,</v>

929
00:54:29.491 --> 00:54:32.550
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the likelihood of being caught for</v>

930
00:54:32.551 --> 00:54:35.550
<v Speaker 1>committing a criminal act decreases to </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically zero and you know,</v>

931
00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:39.120
<v Speaker 1>anti anti social behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

932
00:54:39.121 --> 00:54:41.040
<v Speaker 1>spreads through the population like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>play.</v>

933
00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:42.633
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

934
00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:46.193
<v Speaker 1>I think the reason that people like </v>
<v Speaker 1>hibbler are attractive from a </v>

935
00:54:48.661 --> 00:54:49.494
<v Speaker 1>charismatic perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this also goes from gangster </v>

936
00:54:51.541 --> 00:54:52.680
<v Speaker 1>figures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

937
00:54:52.681 --> 00:54:53.514
<v Speaker 1>in American movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's an absolute plethora is that </v>

938
00:54:57.090 --> 00:54:58.830
<v Speaker 1>people do tend to admire.</v>

939
00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:01.963
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

940
00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:02.933
<v Speaker 1>People do tend to admire those </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals who may see as courageous </v>

941
00:55:06.301 --> 00:55:09.860
<v Speaker 1>enough so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to act on their darker impulses.</v>

942
00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:11.573
<v Speaker 1>And I think the positive and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative reason for that is pure desire </v>

943
00:55:15.271 --> 00:55:16.104
<v Speaker 1>to imitate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the positive aspect of that is that </v>

944
00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:22.830
<v Speaker 1>we know what some mythological level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

945
00:55:22.831 --> 00:55:27.540
<v Speaker 1>that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movement from conventional cowardice</v>

946
00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:28.393
<v Speaker 1>driven morality to a higher order </v>
<v Speaker 1>morality involves necessarily taking </v>

947
00:55:31.861 --> 00:55:32.694
<v Speaker 1>into account a whole plethora of </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational states that are normally </v>

948
00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:37.073
<v Speaker 1>regarded as unacceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like regression and the potential for </v>

949
00:55:41.011 --> 00:55:42.480
<v Speaker 1>cruelty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

950
00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:43.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

951
00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:46.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm inhibited sexual desire and so on </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so forth.</v>

952
00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:48.750
<v Speaker 1>And</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

953
00:55:48.751 --> 00:55:49.584
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the reason why I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're attracted to people like gangster </v>

954
00:55:52.590 --> 00:55:53.423
<v Speaker 1>fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's also because we're </v>

955
00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:59.910
<v Speaker 1>witnessing someone with an effective </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy for accomplishing their goals?</v>

956
00:55:59.911 --> 00:56:03.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean regardless of what the content of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that strategy is,</v>

957
00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:06.210
<v Speaker 1>that's an overall construction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

958
00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:08.880
<v Speaker 1>Well they get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure you could do that.</v>

959
00:56:08.881 --> 00:56:12.090
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that's more the negative end</v>

960
00:56:12.091 --> 00:56:13.710
<v Speaker 1>of the aberration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the point is,</v>

961
00:56:13.711 --> 00:56:16.140
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you ever see the movie goodfellas?</v>

962
00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:17.803
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hated that movie anyways cause I </v>

963
00:56:20.821 --> 00:56:24.280
<v Speaker 1>actually thought it glorified the mom's </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms under the guise of</v>

964
00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:28.940
<v Speaker 4>showing how despicable they weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's okay.</v>

965
00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:31.570
<v Speaker 4>It's a debatable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>debatable proposition.</v>

966
00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:32.463
<v Speaker 4>Certainly the goodfellas believe </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves to be certainly superior </v>

967
00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:38.703
<v Speaker 4>beings because they got what everyone </v>
<v Speaker 4>else wanted without letting fear stop </v>

968
00:56:42.071 --> 00:56:42.904
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's a certain element of truth </v>

969
00:56:43.631 --> 00:56:44.464
<v Speaker 4>to that because one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>does is stop many people from getting </v>

970
00:56:46.901 --> 00:56:48.010
<v Speaker 4>what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fear.</v>

971
00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:52.330
<v Speaker 4>Now you can conclude from that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you should remove all fear and then</v>

972
00:56:52.331 --> 00:56:54.340
<v Speaker 4>do whatever it takes to get exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want.</v>

973
00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:55.513
<v Speaker 4>But you can conclude from that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That fear is not necessarily sufficient </v>

974
00:56:59.681 --> 00:57:02.950
<v Speaker 4>justification for not trying to pursue </v>
<v Speaker 4>the things that</v>

975
00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:07.220
<v Speaker 3>you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So coded interview data,</v>

976
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:10.240
<v Speaker 3>one of these firms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is them.</v>

977
00:57:11.530 --> 00:57:12.363
<v Speaker 3>One of the questions that people had </v>
<v Speaker 3>responded to was to name someone they </v>

978
00:57:15.381 --> 00:57:16.214
<v Speaker 3>admired and why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this was seven years ago in a </v>

979
00:57:20.421 --> 00:57:23.750
<v Speaker 3>disproportionate number of people said </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they admired Ross Perot.</v>

980
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:25.303
<v Speaker 3>Amazing they admired him is because </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially he seemed immune to social </v>

981
00:57:29.991 --> 00:57:34.991
<v Speaker 3>influence seem to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people said things like,</v>

982
00:57:35.301 --> 00:57:38.780
<v Speaker 3>I admire someone who stands up for what </v>
<v Speaker 3>he believes in</v>

983
00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:42.080
<v Speaker 3>whether or not other people agree with </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

984
00:57:42.590 --> 00:57:45.290
<v Speaker 3>Someone who that doesn't change his </v>
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>

985
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:47.150
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even when he's wrong,</v>

986
00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:48.073
<v Speaker 3>even when he might be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who sticks with somebody about </v>

987
00:57:50.331 --> 00:57:55.331
<v Speaker 3>these gangsters seems to resonate with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that sense that they seem immune to,</v>

988
00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:57.533
<v Speaker 4>well sure there's a certain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a certain aspect of </v>

989
00:58:00.001 --> 00:58:01.950
<v Speaker 4>individualism to that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to that whole,</v>

990
00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:05.610
<v Speaker 4>like in the gangster Motif,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's criminal individualism,</v>

991
00:58:05.611 --> 00:58:10.290
<v Speaker 4>but it's still indicative of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>capacity to stand up,</v>

992
00:58:10.530 --> 00:58:12.920
<v Speaker 4>up against group morality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the thing is,</v>

993
00:58:12.921 --> 00:58:15.800
<v Speaker 4>there is an aspect to heroic behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so to speak,</v>

994
00:58:15.801 --> 00:58:16.634
<v Speaker 4>that requires the incorporation of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sorts of aggressive and defiant </v>

995
00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:23.353
<v Speaker 4>attitudes that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that in and of themselves characterize </v>

996
00:58:26.511 --> 00:58:29.240
<v Speaker 4>gangster behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now though I would say that</v>

997
00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:32.113
<v Speaker 4>from the perspective of archetipal </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual behavior on the positive </v>

998
00:58:35.271 --> 00:58:36.104
<v Speaker 4>side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>incorporation of those aggressive </v>

999
00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:39.613
<v Speaker 4>aspects is necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Darwin nation by the MS is counter </v>

1000
00:58:42.371 --> 00:58:44.030
<v Speaker 4>productive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that still doesn't mean,</v>

1001
00:58:44.031 --> 00:58:44.864
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're a little boy and you'd get </v>

1002
00:58:48.321 --> 00:58:50.720
<v Speaker 4>beat up on the playground,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might say,</v>

1003
00:58:50.721 --> 00:58:51.554
<v Speaker 4>well it's better to respond nonviolent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But really that's a mask for the fact </v>

1004
00:58:56.931 --> 00:59:01.730
<v Speaker 4>that you had to swallow the defeat and </v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't respond violently if you wanted</v>

1005
00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:02.593
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the appropriate response to that </v>

1006
00:59:05.541 --> 00:59:10.541
<v Speaker 4>might be to develop the capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 4>respond violently and effectively,</v>

1007
00:59:11.330 --> 00:59:15.130
<v Speaker 4>but not to use it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

1008
00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:16.013
<v Speaker 4>which is to say the absence of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>capacity to respond harshly is no </v>

1009
00:59:19.771 --> 00:59:21.380
<v Speaker 4>evidence for morality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

1010
00:59:21.381 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is</v>

1011
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:25.010
<v Speaker 1>a point you tried to make over and over </v>
<v Speaker 1>and over again.</v>

1012
00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:28.850
<v Speaker 1>So if you can't be cruel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not being cruel is not moral,</v>

1013
00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:29.773
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just your rationalization for an </v>

1014
00:59:31.911 --> 00:59:32.744
<v Speaker 1>inability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that argument's very </v>

1015
00:59:34.701 --> 00:59:36.700
<v Speaker 1>powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I know,</v>

1016
00:59:36.701 --> 00:59:37.534
<v Speaker 1>I also think that's part of the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>why we're so drawn towards people who </v>

1017
00:59:39.921 --> 00:59:40.754
<v Speaker 1>act out their darkest fantasies because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing something we would like </v>

1018
00:59:44.511 --> 00:59:45.344
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but won't.</v>

1019
00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:47.900
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean the thinker thinks </v>
<v Speaker 1>should stop there.</v>

1020
00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:48.953
<v Speaker 1>But say that Jesus' parable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parable of the gnostic gospels that </v>

1021
00:59:51.041 --> 00:59:52.780
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person acts,</v>

1022
00:59:52.830 --> 00:59:54.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1023
00:59:57.050 --> 01:00:01.210
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what it's referring to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold.</v>

1024
01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:05.080
<v Speaker 1>There's this story that Christ is </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking down the road on the sabbath and</v>

1025
01:00:05.090 --> 01:00:05.923
<v Speaker 1>he sees a farmer in the ditch and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>farmer sheep is falling into a hole and </v>

1026
01:00:09.921 --> 01:00:12.020
<v Speaker 1>he's pulling the sheep out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ says to him,</v>

1027
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:14.270
<v Speaker 1>if you know what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

1028
01:00:14.271 --> 01:00:15.740
<v Speaker 1>you were blessed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't,</v>

1029
01:00:15.741 --> 01:00:18.380
<v Speaker 1>you're transgressor of the law in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>curves.</v>

1030
01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:21.230
<v Speaker 1>Anyone just walking down the street is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same idea.</v>

1031
01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:25.130
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

1032
01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:26.840
<v Speaker 1>So the guy who was pulling out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sheep,</v>

1033
01:00:26.841 --> 01:00:27.674
<v Speaker 1>if he's conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has come to terms with his capacity to </v>

1034
01:00:30.021 --> 01:00:30.854
<v Speaker 1>violate social rules and this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>using that to pass being then to pursue </v>

1035
01:00:34.191 --> 01:00:37.940
<v Speaker 1>a higher order level of morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of interpreting the other</v>

1036
01:00:37.941 --> 01:00:38.774
<v Speaker 1>way of interpreting it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's just careless and acting and </v>

1037
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:42.023
<v Speaker 1>callous self interest in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's the thing that's interesting </v>

1038
01:00:44.691 --> 01:00:47.720
<v Speaker 1>about that as the same act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just intense differ.</v>

1039
01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:52.103
<v Speaker 3>How's that?</v>

1040
01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:55.363
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to.</v>

1041
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:57.470
<v Speaker 1>No supposed to work on the Sabbath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1042
01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:58.510
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1043
01:00:58.580 --> 01:00:59.840
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

1044
01:01:00.050 --> 01:01:01.520
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the law.</v>

1045
01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:03.480
<v Speaker 3>The moral law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1046
01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:05.313
<v Speaker 3>Flip it over and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were completely ignorant of the </v>

1047
01:01:07.161 --> 01:01:09.980
<v Speaker 3>law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then he wasn't coming and we're cleaning</v>

1048
01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:12.060
<v Speaker 3>meditative act against the law.</v>

1049
01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1050
01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:15.293
<v Speaker 1>the notion of being ignorant about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>already doesn't enter into that </v>

1051
01:01:17.481 --> 01:01:18.620
<v Speaker 1>particular parable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

1052
01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:22.210
<v Speaker 1>if you're completely ignorant of the law</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you break a rule,</v>

1053
01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:23.053
<v Speaker 1>then you're in the situation of a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And really just like children bring </v>

1054
01:01:25.581 --> 01:01:28.820
<v Speaker 1>social norms all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't make any presumptions about</v>

1055
01:01:28.821 --> 01:01:30.980
<v Speaker 1>their evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a Jennifer rule,</v>

1056
01:01:32.030 --> 01:01:32.863
<v Speaker 1>because they don't know the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the assumption that he knew it was </v>

1057
01:01:34.791 --> 01:01:35.890
<v Speaker 1>the sabbath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1058
01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:36.733
<v Speaker 1>That's the assumption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The assumption is he knew it was the </v>

1059
01:01:37.871 --> 01:01:38.690
<v Speaker 1>sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1060
01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:42.470
<v Speaker 1>That he wasn't just acting like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like remarkable ignorance.</v>

1061
01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:48.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

1062
01:01:48.510 --> 01:01:49.343
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna read another story and this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>from soldier Knutsen and this has to do </v>

1063
01:01:52.741 --> 01:01:56.400
<v Speaker 1>with the ideological version of </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism.</v>

1064
01:01:57.340 --> 01:01:58.173
<v Speaker 1>So Solzhenitsyn is lying with his friend</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hannon railway car that's being set up </v>

1065
01:02:02.791 --> 01:02:03.624
<v Speaker 1>to transport prisoners from one </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration camp to another or to a </v>

1066
01:02:07.231 --> 01:02:11.610
<v Speaker 1>concentration camp to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's my friend Patton and I are lying</v>

1067
01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:12.653
<v Speaker 1>on the middle shelf of a stolen and </v>
<v Speaker 1>department and setting yourselves up </v>

1068
01:02:14.821 --> 01:02:17.550
<v Speaker 1>comfortably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tarp salt hearing in our pockets so that</v>

1069
01:02:17.551 --> 01:02:19.110
<v Speaker 1>we don't need water and can go to sleep.</v>

1070
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:20.903
<v Speaker 4>But at some station or other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they shoved into our compartment of </v>

1071
01:02:22.431 --> 01:02:23.264
<v Speaker 4>Marxist scholar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can tell this from his goatee and </v>

1072
01:02:26.161 --> 01:02:28.980
<v Speaker 4>spectacles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't hide the fact.</v>

1073
01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:31.560
<v Speaker 4>He's a former professor of the communist</v>
<v Speaker 4>academy.</v>

1074
01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:36.000
<v Speaker 4>We hang head down in the square cutout </v>
<v Speaker 4>and from his very first words,</v>

1075
01:02:36.001 --> 01:02:39.960
<v Speaker 4>we see that he is impenetrable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we have been serving time for a very</v>

1076
01:02:39.961 --> 01:02:43.620
<v Speaker 4>long time and we have a long time left </v>
<v Speaker 4>to serve and we melt value.</v>

1077
01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:44.543
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mary joke,</v>

1078
01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:45.893
<v Speaker 4>we must climb down to have a bit of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's ample space left in the </v>

1079
01:02:48.781 --> 01:02:51.690
<v Speaker 4>compartment and so we exchange places </v>
<v Speaker 4>with someone in crowd in.</v>

1080
01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.490
<v Speaker 4>Hello?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hello?</v>

1081
01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:55.380
<v Speaker 4>You're not too crowded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1082
01:02:55.381 --> 01:02:58.350
<v Speaker 4>it's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you been in the jug a long time?</v>

1083
01:02:59.130 --> 01:03:01.620
<v Speaker 4>Long enough?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you past the halfway mark?</v>

1084
01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:06.300
<v Speaker 4>Just look over there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How poverty's tricking our villages,</v>

1085
01:03:06.301 --> 01:03:08.700
<v Speaker 4>our straw thatch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crooked hats.</v>

1086
01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.270
<v Speaker 4>It's an inheritance from the czarist </v>
<v Speaker 4>regime.</v>

1087
01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:15.960
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we've already had 30 Soviet years.</v>

1088
01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.050
<v Speaker 4>That's an insignificant period.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Historically,</v>

1089
01:03:20.070 --> 01:03:22.350
<v Speaker 4>it's terrible that the collective </v>
<v Speaker 4>farmers are starving,</v>

1090
01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:24.383
<v Speaker 4>but have you looked in all their ovens?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just ask any collective farmer NARC </v>

1091
01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:28.910
<v Speaker 4>compartment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1092
01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:31.170
<v Speaker 4>everyone in jail is embittered in </v>
<v Speaker 4>prejudiced,</v>

1093
01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:36.420
<v Speaker 4>but I've seen collective farms myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That means they were uncharacteristic.</v>

1094
01:03:37.410 --> 01:03:39.810
<v Speaker 4>The goatee had never been in any of them</v>
<v Speaker 4>that way.</v>

1095
01:03:39.811 --> 01:03:43.710
<v Speaker 4>It was simpler.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just ask the old folks under the czar,</v>

1096
01:03:43.711 --> 01:03:45.510
<v Speaker 4>they were well fed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well closed,</v>

1097
01:03:45.511 --> 01:03:49.050
<v Speaker 4>and they used to have many holidays.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not even going to ask.</v>

1098
01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:51.750
<v Speaker 4>It's a subjective trade of human memory </v>
<v Speaker 4>to praise everything.</v>

1099
01:03:51.751 --> 01:03:53.460
<v Speaker 4>In the past,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cow,</v>

1100
01:03:53.461 --> 01:03:55.530
<v Speaker 4>the died is the one that gave twice the </v>
<v Speaker 4>milk.</v>

1101
01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:59.850
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes even cited proverbs and our </v>
<v Speaker 4>people don't like holidays.</v>

1102
01:03:59.950 --> 01:04:03.570
<v Speaker 4>They'd like to work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is there a shortage of brand in many</v>

1103
01:04:03.571 --> 01:04:06.600
<v Speaker 4>cities when right before the war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

1104
01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:09.540
<v Speaker 4>not true before the war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in fact,</v>

1105
01:04:09.541 --> 01:04:10.374
<v Speaker 4>everything had been worked out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>falling into precisely at the same trap </v>

1106
01:04:12.751 --> 01:04:13.620
<v Speaker 4>he just described.</v>

1107
01:04:14.970 --> 01:04:15.803
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at that time in all the cities on the </v>

1108
01:04:17.221 --> 01:04:19.740
<v Speaker 4>vogue of the recuse of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

1109
01:04:20.330 --> 01:04:22.470
<v Speaker 4>well that was a local failure and </v>
<v Speaker 4>supply,</v>

1110
01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:27.540
<v Speaker 4>more likely your memory's failing you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a shortage now,</v>

1111
01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:28.913
<v Speaker 4>old wives tales,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have from seven to 8 billion bushels </v>

1112
01:04:30.991 --> 01:04:33.230
<v Speaker 4>of grain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The grain is rotten,</v>

1113
01:04:33.810 --> 01:04:37.980
<v Speaker 4>not so we have been successful in </v>
<v Speaker 4>developing new varieties of grain and so</v>

1114
01:04:37.981 --> 01:04:39.570
<v Speaker 4>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's imperturbable.</v>

1115
01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:40.493
<v Speaker 4>He speaks in the language which requires</v>
<v Speaker 4>no effort of the mind and arguing with </v>

1116
01:04:43.531 --> 01:04:44.364
<v Speaker 4>him is like walking through a desert,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the emergence of some </v>

1117
01:04:47.161 --> 01:04:48.660
<v Speaker 4>mythological imagery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>

1118
01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:50.453
<v Speaker 4>it's about people like that that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>say he made the rounds of all the </v>

1119
01:04:52.891 --> 01:04:53.724
<v Speaker 4>blacksmiths and came home on shot and </v>
<v Speaker 4>when they write in their obituaries </v>

1120
01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:01.260
<v Speaker 4>perished tragically during the period of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the stellar count.</v>

1121
01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:04.230
<v Speaker 4>It should be corrected to read perished </v>
<v Speaker 4>karmically.</v>

1122
01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:06.840
<v Speaker 4>But if his faith had worked out </v>
<v Speaker 4>differently,</v>

1123
01:05:06.841 --> 01:05:07.674
<v Speaker 4>we would have never learned what a dry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>insignificant little man he was who </v>

1124
01:05:10.221 --> 01:05:12.450
<v Speaker 4>would respectfully read his name in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>newspaper.</v>

1125
01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:13.433
<v Speaker 4>He would've become people's commissar or</v>
<v Speaker 4>even venture to represent all Russia </v>

1126
01:05:16.141 --> 01:05:19.390
<v Speaker 4>abroad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To argue with him was useless.</v>

1127
01:05:19.630 --> 01:05:21.490
<v Speaker 4>It was much more interesting to play </v>
<v Speaker 4>with him.</v>

1128
01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:26.230
<v Speaker 4>Not a chess but at the game of comrades.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There really is such a game.</v>

1129
01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:28.360
<v Speaker 4>It's a very simple game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His play up,</v>

1130
01:05:28.361 --> 01:05:29.194
<v Speaker 4>Tim a couple of times or so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>use some of his pet words and phrases </v>

1131
01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:35.680
<v Speaker 4>here like it for his.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has grown accustomed to find that all</v>

1132
01:05:35.681 --> 01:05:36.514
<v Speaker 4>around them are enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's become weary of snarling and </v>

1133
01:05:38.891 --> 01:05:39.724
<v Speaker 4>doesn't like to tell his stories because</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of them will be twisted around and </v>

1134
01:05:41.981 --> 01:05:45.490
<v Speaker 4>thrown right back in his face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if he takes you for one of his own,</v>

1135
01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:49.390
<v Speaker 4>he will quite humanly disclosed to you </v>
<v Speaker 4>what he is seen at the station.</v>

1136
01:05:49.810 --> 01:05:51.520
<v Speaker 4>People are passing by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>laughs,</v>

1137
01:05:51.550 --> 01:05:52.383
<v Speaker 4>laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking life goes on parties providing </v>

1138
01:05:54.851 --> 01:05:57.640
<v Speaker 4>leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are being moved from job to job,</v>

1139
01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:58.743
<v Speaker 4>that's for sure.</v>

1140
01:05:59.050 --> 01:06:00.970
<v Speaker 4>Yet you and are languishing here in </v>
<v Speaker 4>prison.</v>

1141
01:06:01.450 --> 01:06:05.410
<v Speaker 4>There are only a handful of us and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>must write and write petitions,</v>

1142
01:06:05.411 --> 01:06:06.244
<v Speaker 4>begging a review of our cases,</v>
<v Speaker 4>begging for a pardon or else he will </v>

1143
01:06:09.611 --> 01:06:12.310
<v Speaker 4>tell you something interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the Communist Academy,</v>

1144
01:06:12.311 --> 01:06:16.450
<v Speaker 4>they decided to devour one comrade.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They decided he wasn't quite genuine,</v>

1145
01:06:16.690 --> 01:06:19.570
<v Speaker 4>not one of our own,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but somehow they couldn't manage it.</v>

1146
01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:23.350
<v Speaker 4>There were no errors in his essays and </v>
<v Speaker 4>his biography was clean.</v>

1147
01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:25.720
<v Speaker 4>Then all of a sudden going through the </v>
<v Speaker 4>archives,</v>

1148
01:06:25.721 --> 01:06:26.554
<v Speaker 4>what a fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They ran across an old low brochure </v>

1149
01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:29.553
<v Speaker 4>written by this comrade in which </v>
<v Speaker 4>Vladimir Ilyich Lenin himself had held </v>

1150
01:06:32.411 --> 01:06:35.290
<v Speaker 4>in his hands and in the margin of which </v>
<v Speaker 4>he had written in his own handwriting.</v>

1151
01:06:35.291 --> 01:06:37.870
<v Speaker 4>The notation as an economist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he is shit.</v>

1152
01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:42.910
<v Speaker 4>Well now you understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our companion smelled confidentially,</v>

1153
01:06:43.030 --> 01:06:43.863
<v Speaker 4>but after that it was no trouble at all </v>
<v Speaker 4>to make short work of that model had an </v>

1154
01:06:46.541 --> 01:06:47.374
<v Speaker 4>imposter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was expelled from the academy and </v>

1155
01:06:48.761 --> 01:06:53.560
<v Speaker 4>deprived of his scholarly rank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The railroad cars go clicking along.</v>

1156
01:06:54.190 --> 01:06:56.740
<v Speaker 4>Everyone has already asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some line down,</v>

1157
01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:57.693
<v Speaker 4>some sitting up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes a convoy guard passes along </v>

1158
01:07:00.371 --> 01:07:01.204
<v Speaker 4>the corridor yawning and one more </v>
<v Speaker 4>unrecorded episode from Lennon's </v>

1159
01:07:05.141 --> 01:07:06.940
<v Speaker 4>biography is lost from view.</v>

1160
01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:17.490
<v Speaker 4>I read,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I read you that story because it is,</v>

1161
01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:18.473
<v Speaker 4>it provides an interesting relationship </v>
<v Speaker 4>between the adoption of a totalitarian </v>

1162
01:07:24.181 --> 01:07:27.570
<v Speaker 4>position and the necessary consequence </v>
<v Speaker 4>of that adoption,</v>

1163
01:07:27.571 --> 01:07:28.404
<v Speaker 4>which is instantly the desire to torment</v>
<v Speaker 4>and persecute anyone who doesn't belong </v>

1164
01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:36.780
<v Speaker 4>to that particular tall attarian </v>
<v Speaker 4>position.</v>

1165
01:07:36.781 --> 01:07:37.381
<v Speaker 4>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1166
01:07:37.381 --> 01:07:39.570
<v Speaker 4>it's not just a matter of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1167
01:07:40.110 --> 01:07:43.560
<v Speaker 4>the desire to protect the integrity of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the totalitarian position.</v>

1168
01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:44.543
<v Speaker 4>That's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also the fact that adoption of the </v>

1169
01:07:48.691 --> 01:07:49.524
<v Speaker 4>totalitarian position allows those who </v>
<v Speaker 4>have adopted it to rationalize and </v>

1170
01:07:54.001 --> 01:07:59.001
<v Speaker 4>justify their admitted desires to take </v>
<v Speaker 4>revenge on the world.</v>

1171
01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:01.921
<v Speaker 4>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1172
01:08:01.921 --> 01:08:02.754
<v Speaker 4>why do they want to take revenge on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world and the revenge on the world in </v>

1173
01:08:05.281 --> 01:08:06.114
<v Speaker 4>the form of other people?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would you want to take revenge on </v>

1174
01:08:08.251 --> 01:08:11.310
<v Speaker 4>the world?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's because from your perspective,</v>

1175
01:08:11.490 --> 01:08:14.880
<v Speaker 4>the world has tortured you unjustly and </v>
<v Speaker 4>unfairly.</v>

1176
01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:16.520
<v Speaker 4>And under those circumstances,</v>

1177
01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:20.810
<v Speaker 1>the only logical thing to do is to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact attempt to extract your revenge.</v>

1178
01:08:21.370 --> 01:08:22.203
<v Speaker 1>Or we know already from looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>myth of genesis and the kind of the </v>

1179
01:08:25.581 --> 01:08:29.330
<v Speaker 1>story of the fall of the Buddha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's ample reason in the average</v>

1180
01:08:29.331 --> 01:08:30.164
<v Speaker 1>human life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to have a pathological </v>

1181
01:08:31.341 --> 01:08:32.174
<v Speaker 1>background to have had enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences to make it appear to you </v>

1182
01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:37.033
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1183
01:08:37.070 --> 01:08:37.903
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a substantial amount of </v>

1184
01:08:39.711 --> 01:08:40.544
<v Speaker 1>justification that the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions of life are sufficiently </v>

1185
01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:44.873
<v Speaker 1>unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that the logical thing to do well </v>

1186
01:08:47.051 --> 01:08:49.850
<v Speaker 1>being alive is to work for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction of life.</v>

1187
01:08:52.030 --> 01:08:52.863
<v Speaker 1>When we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said that we were going to spend a </v>

1188
01:08:54.201 --> 01:08:55.034
<v Speaker 1>fair amount of time trying to build up </v>
<v Speaker 1>some representation of the personality </v>

1189
01:08:59.181 --> 01:09:01.730
<v Speaker 1>that is being used in mythology to </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent the evil.</v>

1190
01:09:01.731 --> 01:09:04.180
<v Speaker 1>And it's kind of complicated because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't some,</v>

1191
01:09:04.190 --> 01:09:08.900
<v Speaker 1>it isn't something that you can just </v>
<v Speaker 1>list asset as a set of fixed attributes.</v>

1192
01:09:08.901 --> 01:09:12.230
<v Speaker 1>You have to get an idea of the dynamic </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of the process.</v>

1193
01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:13.543
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1194
01:09:13.670 --> 01:09:14.503
<v Speaker 1>while I'm trying to do that by telling </v>
<v Speaker 1>you some different stories that </v>

1195
01:09:16.251 --> 01:09:17.084
<v Speaker 1>hopefully fit into a pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also want to outline some of the </v>

1196
01:09:19.071 --> 01:09:19.904
<v Speaker 1>things that seem</v>

1197
01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:22.720
<v Speaker 6>what you said earlier in the lecture is </v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

1198
01:09:22.721 --> 01:09:23.554
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you said this last section that </v>

1199
01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:26.223
<v Speaker 6>human,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that humans see more danger in the </v>

1200
01:09:30.161 --> 01:09:32.130
<v Speaker 6>unknown that they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because of their cognition,</v>

1201
01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:33.093
<v Speaker 6>but what it seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what you just said right now is that </v>

1202
01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:38.660
<v Speaker 6>their cognition isn't necessarily made </v>
<v Speaker 6>the end on a more potent,</v>

1203
01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:39.993
<v Speaker 6>but that it attributes no tomorrow kinds</v>
<v Speaker 6>of things and the danger to more kinds </v>

1204
01:09:43.991 --> 01:09:45.340
<v Speaker 6>of things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so this,</v>

1205
01:09:45.341 --> 01:09:49.270
<v Speaker 6>this guy or people in that veteran a to </v>
<v Speaker 6>talk to [inaudible] um,</v>

1206
01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:50.651
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>regime,</v>

1207
01:09:50.651 --> 01:09:52.840
<v Speaker 6>whatever it can see the unknown and more</v>
<v Speaker 6>kinds of things,</v>

1208
01:09:52.841 --> 01:09:53.674
<v Speaker 6>the abstract it to other things rather </v>
<v Speaker 6>than necessarily things be more potent </v>

1209
01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:58.390
<v Speaker 6>or I would say that it's also the case</v>

1210
01:09:58.460 --> 01:09:59.293
<v Speaker 1>does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see it we're animals wouldn't </v>

1211
01:10:00.341 --> 01:10:04.870
<v Speaker 1>see merely by party because you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>switch frames of reference and something</v>

1212
01:10:04.871 --> 01:10:08.050
<v Speaker 1>that's known and one in one frame of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reference is unknown in another.</v>

1213
01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:09.153
<v Speaker 1>And you can also imagine there's ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>where things that seem comfortable at </v>

1214
01:10:11.561 --> 01:10:14.200
<v Speaker 1>the moment might indicate some potential</v>
<v Speaker 1>danger in the future,</v>

1215
01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:16.960
<v Speaker 1>which is what you do when you worry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you worry,</v>

1216
01:10:16.961 --> 01:10:18.880
<v Speaker 1>basically you're somewhere safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1217
01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:21.010
<v Speaker 1>as a general rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not always the case.</v>

1218
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're somewhere unsafe,</v>

1219
01:10:23.351 --> 01:10:26.380
<v Speaker 1>then you're afraid of that and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're worried you usually you're in</v>

1220
01:10:26.381 --> 01:10:27.011
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1221
01:10:27.011 --> 01:10:28.570
<v Speaker 1>in your living room chair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1222
01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:29.583
<v Speaker 1>And you were attributing emergence's of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the unknown to all sorts of </v>

1223
01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:35.350
<v Speaker 1>potentialities and perhaps trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem solve at the same time.</v>

1224
01:10:36.150 --> 01:10:38.530
<v Speaker 6>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is unfair and unjust?</v>

1225
01:10:40.010 --> 01:10:42.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say a unpredictable,</v>

1226
01:10:42.291 --> 01:10:43.124
<v Speaker 1>that would be one aspect of it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't learn to avoid something </v>

1227
01:10:46.671 --> 01:10:48.350
<v Speaker 1>that's unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also,</v>

1228
01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:49.463
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I think we tend to regard a </v>

1229
01:10:50.541 --> 01:10:51.374
<v Speaker 1>punishment as just if it's only </v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficient to eradicate the behavior </v>

1230
01:10:55.071 --> 01:10:55.904
<v Speaker 1>that preceded it.</v>

1231
01:10:58.970 --> 01:11:01.780
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we just,</v>

1232
01:11:01.781 --> 01:11:04.120
<v Speaker 1>we strive towards that in the criminal </v>
<v Speaker 1>justice system,</v>

1233
01:11:04.121 --> 01:11:05.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it means.</v>

1234
01:11:05.051 --> 01:11:07.120
<v Speaker 1>That the punishment should fit the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crime.</v>

1235
01:11:07.330 --> 01:11:07.851
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1236
01:11:07.851 --> 01:11:10.880
<v Speaker 1>I think is that there should be a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And often we seem to be punished.</v>

1237
01:11:10.881 --> 01:11:12.790
<v Speaker 1>And despite the fact that there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence of crime,</v>

1238
01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:14.003
<v Speaker 1>and it also should be that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the punishment is the right match for </v>

1239
01:11:17.791 --> 01:11:18.511
<v Speaker 1>the crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

1240
01:11:18.511 --> 01:11:20.100
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to understand what that might </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>

1241
01:11:20.101 --> 01:11:23.520
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at how you treat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll say a dog or that you're trying to</v>

1242
01:11:23.521 --> 01:11:27.750
<v Speaker 1>train him to not do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it pees on your rug for example,</v>

1243
01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.033
<v Speaker 1>there might be a punishment that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would consider sufficiently matched to </v>

1244
01:11:32.521 --> 01:11:37.521
<v Speaker 1>that act so that it might be regarded by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dog is just so,</v>

1245
01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:38.723
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a swat on the behind with the </v>

1246
01:11:40.171 --> 01:11:42.650
<v Speaker 1>newspaper rather than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1247
01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:45.540
<v Speaker 1>being beat half to death with a stick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

1248
01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:48.750
<v Speaker 1>So the source of the sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriateness.</v>

1249
01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1250
01:11:54.150 --> 01:11:55.350
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1251
01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:57.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't exactly know how that's worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1252
01:11:57.481 --> 01:11:59.130
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of it's trial and error.</v>

1253
01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:05.160
<v Speaker 1>I can't really say much more about data </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the moment.</v>

1254
01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:08.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's partly looked like if say </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing,</v>

1255
01:12:08.611 --> 01:12:11.490
<v Speaker 1>I see this with my children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is how do you,</v>

1256
01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:12.900
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you,</v>

1257
01:12:12.901 --> 01:12:14.130
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to use,</v>

1258
01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:14.993
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to use a</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative feedback as well as positive </v>

1259
01:12:19.861 --> 01:12:24.540
<v Speaker 1>feedback to set borders around children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the question is,</v>

1260
01:12:24.541 --> 01:12:28.260
<v Speaker 1>well where does the notion of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitute just punishment come from and</v>

1261
01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:30.210
<v Speaker 1>not sort of interaction?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1262
01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:31.613
<v Speaker 1>you have to experiment with people in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense to determine the nature of their </v>

1263
01:12:34.861 --> 01:12:36.630
<v Speaker 1>temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because for some people,</v>

1264
01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:38.400
<v Speaker 1>for my daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1265
01:12:38.610 --> 01:12:42.240
<v Speaker 1>if I point my finger at her and say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's doing something that she shouldn't</v>

1266
01:12:42.241 --> 01:12:43.470
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'll stop.</v>

1267
01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:47.250
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if I do that with my son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's just irrelevant.</v>

1268
01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:50.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean that that level of punishment is </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely negligible.</v>

1269
01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:52.890
<v Speaker 1>So for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes a just punishment?</v>

1270
01:12:52.891 --> 01:12:53.724
<v Speaker 1>As far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that's like higher up in </v>

1271
01:12:56.011 --> 01:12:56.844
<v Speaker 1>intensity than it is for my daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's probably a matter of </v>

1272
01:12:59.221 --> 01:13:00.690
<v Speaker 1>temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1273
01:13:02.250 --> 01:13:04.650
<v Speaker 1>well that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's also younger than her,</v>

1274
01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:07.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1275
01:13:07.970 --> 01:13:11.610
<v Speaker 1>that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is more sensitive to punishment and they</v>

1276
01:13:11.611 --> 01:13:14.520
<v Speaker 1>sell in the younger one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1277
01:13:14.530 --> 01:13:15.363
<v Speaker 1>we have like my family here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be the oldest and I was like </v>

1278
01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:21.380
<v Speaker 1>people being mad at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was an,</v>

1279
01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:22.410
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1280
01:13:22.710 --> 01:13:25.620
<v Speaker 1>Next Sibling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dallas Wild One.</v>

1281
01:13:26.050 --> 01:13:28.230
<v Speaker 1>You know here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's another example.</v>

1282
01:13:28.231 --> 01:13:31.230
<v Speaker 1>In English common law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the,</v>

1283
01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:32.753
<v Speaker 1>you have the right to use reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>force to protect yourself against </v>

1284
01:13:37.591 --> 01:13:38.424
<v Speaker 1>violation of your rights by an intruder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which basically means that if someone </v>

1285
01:13:42.031 --> 01:13:44.970
<v Speaker 1>breaks into your house and you have a 45</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolver,</v>

1286
01:13:45.150 --> 01:13:47.280
<v Speaker 1>you can't shoot them without saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>

1287
01:13:47.610 --> 01:13:49.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a little more complex than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1288
01:13:49.261 --> 01:13:50.094
<v Speaker 1>but the point is is that you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to use the minimum amount of </v>

1289
01:13:52.441 --> 01:13:55.680
<v Speaker 1>force that's necessary to stop the thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shouldn't be happening.</v>

1290
01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:59.190
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's a critical aspect of justice</v>

1291
01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:02.700
<v Speaker 1>along with the notion of predictability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think those are the two.</v>

1292
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Those are the two poles of justice as </v>
<v Speaker 1>far as I'm concerned.</v>

1293
01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.680
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1294
01:14:07.681 --> 01:14:08.514
<v Speaker 1>what we're trying to do is to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>what his personality is characterized </v>

1295
01:14:11.651 --> 01:14:12.484
<v Speaker 1>by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's complex because there's a feedback </v>

1296
01:14:13.961 --> 01:14:16.390
<v Speaker 1>problem though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say like why is it,</v>

1297
01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:22.380
<v Speaker 1>see if I can get the argument down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pat Say</v>

1298
01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:29.280
<v Speaker 1>the personality of evil is characterized</v>
<v Speaker 1>by a tendency to deny error,</v>

1299
01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:35.130
<v Speaker 1>so a totalitarian personality is someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who can admit to being wrong and I would</v>

1300
01:14:35.131 --> 01:14:37.050
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's equivalent to not being able</v>

1301
01:14:37.051 --> 01:14:39.360
<v Speaker 1>to deny the existence of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

1302
01:14:39.361 --> 01:14:40.194
<v Speaker 1>Because when you say I wasn't wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're saying is that the </v>

1303
01:14:44.701 --> 01:14:45.534
<v Speaker 1>information that I've received,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which indicates that there's a flaw in </v>

1304
01:14:48.271 --> 01:14:51.480
<v Speaker 1>my argument actually doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no such flop,</v>

1305
01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:52.473
<v Speaker 1>but she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might reinterpret the information or </v>

1306
01:14:54.211 --> 01:14:55.044
<v Speaker 1>you might readjust your fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totality gelateria and idea to some </v>

1307
01:14:57.811 --> 01:15:00.330
<v Speaker 1>degree to shut the ideo or effectively </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>

1308
01:15:00.331 --> 01:15:01.164
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess what I'm saying is that refusal </v>

1309
01:15:04.441 --> 01:15:05.274
<v Speaker 1>to admit to error is exactly the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing as a denial of anomalous </v>

1310
01:15:08.281 --> 01:15:09.114
<v Speaker 1>information and I think that's why where</v>
<v Speaker 1>why one of the hallmark attributes of </v>

1311
01:15:13.861 --> 01:15:18.120
<v Speaker 1>the devil in classical mythology is </v>
<v Speaker 1>pride because that's what pride is.</v>

1312
01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:23.000
<v Speaker 1>Pride is the statement on it's more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1313
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:25.790
<v Speaker 1>It's normally the state that I never </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a mistake,</v>

1314
01:15:25.850 --> 01:15:26.810
<v Speaker 1>which is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

1315
01:15:26.811 --> 01:15:31.190
<v Speaker 1>there's no anomalous information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also the statement for me.</v>

1316
01:15:31.191 --> 01:15:34.400
<v Speaker 1>There is no anomalous information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't the statement for me.</v>

1317
01:15:34.401 --> 01:15:38.600
<v Speaker 1>There's no one that's Florida territory </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the statement that for me,</v>

1318
01:15:38.601 --> 01:15:39.434
<v Speaker 1>there's no unexplored territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly equivalent to the </v>

1319
01:15:41.631 --> 01:15:44.480
<v Speaker 1>presumption of personal omniscience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>

1320
01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:47.450
<v Speaker 1>If there's no unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know everything.</v>

1321
01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milton story,</v>

1322
01:15:49.191 --> 01:15:50.260
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

1323
01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:53.750
<v Speaker 1>that's the story of Satan's fall as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>description,</v>

1324
01:15:53.751 --> 01:15:54.584
<v Speaker 1>mythological description of a pattern of</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior just characterized by implicit </v>

1325
01:15:58.131 --> 01:15:58.881
<v Speaker 1>adoption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loss,</v>

1326
01:15:58.881 --> 01:16:00.710
<v Speaker 1>explicit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that story explicit.</v>

1327
01:16:00.711 --> 01:16:02.480
<v Speaker 1>A dog should have a missed him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're saying,</v>

1328
01:16:02.481 --> 01:16:03.320
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

1329
01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:04.333
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1330
01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:05.183
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it instantly involves these other </v>

1331
01:16:06.351 --> 01:16:07.330
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pride,</v>

1332
01:16:08.090 --> 01:16:11.690
<v Speaker 3>arrogance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totalitarianism.</v>

1333
01:16:14.050 --> 01:16:17.460
<v Speaker 3>Now you might say that</v>

1334
01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:19.323
<v Speaker 1>follower of a creed rather than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>origin nater of a creed isn't someone </v>

1335
01:16:22.591 --> 01:16:26.070
<v Speaker 1>who's presuming personal omniscience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I would say,</v>

1336
01:16:26.071 --> 01:16:26.904
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're even more corrupt than the </v>

1337
01:16:27.631 --> 01:16:31.290
<v Speaker 1>actual leader because they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1338
01:16:31.291 --> 01:16:32.580
<v Speaker 1>he's the boss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's gone.</v>

1339
01:16:32.581 --> 01:16:34.620
<v Speaker 1>I'll do everything he tells me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're actually,</v>

1340
01:16:35.070 --> 01:16:35.903
<v Speaker 1>they're actually eliminating there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least the person who establishes the </v>

1341
01:16:41.161 --> 01:16:43.110
<v Speaker 1>dog dogma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Hitler for example,</v>

1342
01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:47.700
<v Speaker 1>is taking a personal part in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>construction of the theory.</v>

1343
01:16:47.850 --> 01:16:48.683
<v Speaker 1>Someone who follows Hitler has </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely abrogated any personal </v>

1344
01:16:52.081 --> 01:16:55.670
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for making any moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgements whatsoever to the leader.</v>

1345
01:16:55.671 --> 01:16:58.770
<v Speaker 1>So I think actually the followers are </v>
<v Speaker 1>more pathological than the leader.</v>

1346
01:16:59.120 --> 01:16:59.953
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1347
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:02.520
<v Speaker 1>I think that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are,</v>

1348
01:17:02.521 --> 01:17:05.970
<v Speaker 1>these things all make a complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of these natural categories</v>

1349
01:17:05.971 --> 01:17:09.030
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the question,</v>

1350
01:17:09.170 --> 01:17:10.160
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they lead to?</v>

1351
01:17:10.161 --> 01:17:12.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that the reason that there's</v>

1352
01:17:12.261 --> 01:17:13.094
<v Speaker 1>a negative here and a negative here is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because these two processes feedback </v>

1353
01:17:16.881 --> 01:17:18.680
<v Speaker 1>onto one another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say,</v>

1354
01:17:18.681 --> 01:17:20.570
<v Speaker 1>remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you have said that we had a set,</v>

1355
01:17:20.571 --> 01:17:23.540
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't on a lonely age that made </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems decrepit.</v>

1356
01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:25.670
<v Speaker 1>It was the sins of men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the question is,</v>

1357
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:26.661
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean?</v>

1358
01:17:26.661 --> 01:17:28.310
<v Speaker 1>It was the sense of men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to ask,</v>

1359
01:17:28.311 --> 01:17:29.144
<v Speaker 1>what does sin mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically from the mythological </v>

1360
01:17:30.741 --> 01:17:31.574
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that gets you into a discussion of </v>

1361
01:17:32.751 --> 01:17:34.640
<v Speaker 1>the question of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>

1362
01:17:34.641 --> 01:17:35.474
<v Speaker 1>well the thing that underlies evil most </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally is the process of the </v>

1363
01:17:40.311 --> 01:17:41.144
<v Speaker 1>denial of anomalous information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that you have a theory </v>

1364
01:17:44.130 --> 01:17:45.680
<v Speaker 1>kind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a piece of evidence pops up,</v>

1365
01:17:45.681 --> 01:17:48.830
<v Speaker 1>which according to your own criteria for</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>

1366
01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:50.173
<v Speaker 1>because you set that as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>indicates that your theory is actually </v>

1367
01:17:52.401 --> 01:17:53.660
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

1368
01:17:53.670 --> 01:17:56.330
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be objective back of </v>
<v Speaker 1>any sort.</v>

1369
01:17:56.690 --> 01:17:57.523
<v Speaker 1>It's by your own criteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some things popped up that indicates </v>

1370
01:18:00.651 --> 01:18:02.840
<v Speaker 1>that you're wrong and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

1371
01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:05.840
<v Speaker 1>that thing doesn't exist and you can say</v>
<v Speaker 1>that lots of ways.</v>

1372
01:18:05.850 --> 01:18:06.683
<v Speaker 1>You can just</v>
<v Speaker 1>see Freud thought you had to actively </v>

1373
01:18:09.831 --> 01:18:13.820
<v Speaker 1>repress information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anomalous or traumatic information,</v>

1374
01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:15.200
<v Speaker 1>but that's not right.</v>

1375
01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:20.870
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to actively repress it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a sin of omission and not a</v>

1376
01:18:20.871 --> 01:18:21.704
<v Speaker 1>sin of commission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if a piece of novel information </v>

1377
01:18:23.541 --> 01:18:27.560
<v Speaker 1>comes up and you do nothing about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you haven't processed it.</v>

1378
01:18:28.190 --> 01:18:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's to,</v>

1379
01:18:29.611 --> 01:18:30.444
<v Speaker 1>to take into account a piece of global </v>
<v Speaker 1>information means that you have to </v>

1380
01:18:33.141 --> 01:18:33.974
<v Speaker 1>explore the thing that's normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>draw the necessary behavioral </v>

1381
01:18:36.651 --> 01:18:39.500
<v Speaker 1>conclusions and update your scheme of </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

1382
01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:40.513
<v Speaker 1>So it isn't as if when something novel </v>
<v Speaker 1>pops up and you admit to its existence </v>

1383
01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:46.820
<v Speaker 1>automatically the way you think is made </v>
<v Speaker 1>proper,</v>

1384
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:49.500
<v Speaker 1>it's that to actually process something </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal,</v>

1385
01:18:49.501 --> 01:18:51.800
<v Speaker 1>you have to go through a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of work.</v>

1386
01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:56.980
<v Speaker 1>Some of the work which actually involved</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of these sense and resurrection,</v>

1387
01:18:57.301 --> 01:18:58.670
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we talked about.</v>

1388
01:18:58.671 --> 01:19:00.410
<v Speaker 1>So if you're</v>

1389
01:19:02.210 --> 01:19:03.043
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1390
01:19:04.410 --> 01:19:05.930
<v Speaker 1>finish the argument here in a sec.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1391
01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:08.940
<v Speaker 1>so we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a sin as to the Nile of anomaly,</v>

1392
01:19:08.970 --> 01:19:11.250
<v Speaker 1>but we have original sin already is </v>
<v Speaker 1>curiosity,</v>

1393
01:19:12.170 --> 01:19:16.220
<v Speaker 3>which is precisely the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

1394
01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:17.913
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me see if</v>

1395
01:19:22.290 --> 01:19:26.020
<v Speaker 3>it's more than of curiosity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the</v>

1396
01:19:27.550 --> 01:19:32.500
<v Speaker 3>desire to be on a status.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also dial.</v>

1397
01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:34.253
<v Speaker 3>I guess</v>

1398
01:19:35.210 --> 01:19:37.380
<v Speaker 1>we expressed it as curiosity here last </v>
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>

1399
01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:38.673
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also mentioned last week if there </v>

1400
01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:41.273
<v Speaker 1>was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a paradoxical aspect to that </v>

1401
01:19:43.111 --> 01:19:47.040
<v Speaker 1>because the gnostics for example </v>
<v Speaker 1>regarding the serpent tempted,</v>

1402
01:19:47.041 --> 01:19:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Adam and Eve has a higher order day than</v>
<v Speaker 1>the god that had created things to begin</v>

1403
01:19:51.901 --> 01:19:52.734
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was a heretical position from </v>

1404
01:19:54.091 --> 01:19:54.924
<v Speaker 1>the perspective of the sec that </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed into the standard Christian </v>

1405
01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:58.793
<v Speaker 1>Church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also the case that even in </v>

1406
01:19:59.761 --> 01:20:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Catholicism in the mini and medieval </v>
<v Speaker 1>era,</v>

1407
01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:03.953
<v Speaker 1>original sin was regarded as a fortunate</v>
<v Speaker 1>sin because it was a precondition the </v>

1408
01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:10.530
<v Speaker 1>for the drama of the passion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could say,</v>

1409
01:20:10.531 --> 01:20:14.850
<v Speaker 1>well</v>
<v Speaker 1>original sin was regarded as a precursor</v>

1410
01:20:14.851 --> 01:20:18.750
<v Speaker 1>of evil because it was curiosity that </v>
<v Speaker 1>knocked Adam and eve out of paradise.</v>

1411
01:20:18.751 --> 01:20:19.584
<v Speaker 1>And also the took the boot outside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the walled city that his father had set </v>

1412
01:20:22.981 --> 01:20:23.814
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So from that perspective it's very </v>

1413
01:20:25.171 --> 01:20:26.004
<v Speaker 1>negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that it's curiosity and </v>

1414
01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:31.080
<v Speaker 1>that brings a nominalist information to </v>
<v Speaker 1>into an otherwise stable system.</v>

1415
01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:33.840
<v Speaker 1>But from another perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is broader,</v>

1416
01:20:33.841 --> 01:20:36.840
<v Speaker 1>I think you might regard it as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fortunate proclivity.</v>

1417
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:40.890
<v Speaker 1>So I think it depends on your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your temporal frame of reference.</v>

1418
01:20:40.891 --> 01:20:43.410
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a kind of a standard.</v>

1419
01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:46.080
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation.</v>

1420
01:20:46.081 --> 01:20:46.914
<v Speaker 1>It's something we'll return to actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the last lecture of this course </v>

1421
01:20:49.681 --> 01:20:53.610
<v Speaker 1>because there's a myth that young pulled</v>
<v Speaker 1>out from England that actually addresses</v>

1422
01:20:53.611 --> 01:20:56.910
<v Speaker 1>that point directly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a paragraph long,</v>

1423
01:20:56.911 --> 01:20:57.744
<v Speaker 1>but it describes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it tries to put original sin into </v>

1424
01:21:01.051 --> 01:21:05.250
<v Speaker 1>the context of the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole story of redemption,</v>

1425
01:21:05.251 --> 01:21:07.110
<v Speaker 1>which isn't just Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just the story,</v>

1426
01:21:07.710 --> 01:21:08.543
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a stable preexistence state </v>

1427
01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:14.040
<v Speaker 1>deterioration into a state of chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then a regeneration on a more integrated</v>

1428
01:21:14.041 --> 01:21:14.874
<v Speaker 1>playing original sin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Original sin is a portrait and </v>

1429
01:21:16.961 --> 01:21:18.600
<v Speaker 1>necessarily a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1430
01:21:18.601 --> 01:21:21.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you look at it from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective of being in chaos,</v>

1431
01:21:21.571 --> 01:21:22.740
<v Speaker 1>so we say you're in chaos.</v>

1432
01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:23.191
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1433
01:21:23.191 --> 01:21:24.450
<v Speaker 1>what got me here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1434
01:21:24.451 --> 01:21:28.800
<v Speaker 1>if I were to just shut up and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>bothered going down that path,</v>

1435
01:21:28.801 --> 01:21:31.800
<v Speaker 1>that my curiosity drove me down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'd still be,</v>

1436
01:21:31.801 --> 01:21:34.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting comfortably ensconced at home.</v>

1437
01:21:34.111 --> 01:21:38.190
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be in this horrible stew of </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional wretchedness that I'm in,</v>

1438
01:21:38.191 --> 01:21:39.480
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think you know,</v>

1439
01:21:39.481 --> 01:21:41.460
<v Speaker 1>if you think about that story read </v>
<v Speaker 1>large,</v>

1440
01:21:41.461 --> 01:21:42.710
<v Speaker 1>the notion is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1441
01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:43.553
<v Speaker 1>if we wouldn't have developed this </v>
<v Speaker 1>cortical cap that allows us the ability </v>

1442
01:21:46.561 --> 01:21:47.394
<v Speaker 1>to manipulate abstract bits of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information had never become self </v>

1443
01:21:51.901 --> 01:21:54.230
<v Speaker 1>conscious at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would have been in a,</v>

1444
01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:55.313
<v Speaker 1>in a paradise light position like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals who are in a sense beyond good </v>

1445
01:21:58.831 --> 01:22:00.060
<v Speaker 1>and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1446
01:22:00.061 --> 01:22:02.030
<v Speaker 1>Voltaire said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well not,</v>

1447
01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:05.790
<v Speaker 1>I included Voltaire's little commentary </v>
<v Speaker 1>on that line of logic and he said,</v>

1448
01:22:05.791 --> 01:22:08.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the,</v>

1449
01:22:09.630 --> 01:22:12.690
<v Speaker 1>I know more succinctly putting this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember who said this,</v>

1450
01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:17.960
<v Speaker 1>it's better to be an unhappy philosopher</v>
<v Speaker 1>than a happy paying that sort of nest.</v>

1451
01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:21.960
<v Speaker 1>You can also think of that as a form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pride anyways.</v>

1452
01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:25.380
<v Speaker 1>Of course the ultimate attainment is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be an unhappy pain</v>

1453
01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:28.920
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1454
01:22:32.190 --> 01:22:33.023
<v Speaker 3>Have you not considered modifying your </v>
<v Speaker 3>vocabulary since the meeting of your </v>

1455
01:22:37.411 --> 01:22:38.244
<v Speaker 3>vocabulary in this climate is it takes </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the meaning of that which would have </v>

1456
01:22:43.561 --> 01:22:44.394
<v Speaker 3>been taught the representative of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>church where it's where the devil will </v>

1457
01:22:48.931 --> 01:22:49.764
<v Speaker 3>be used to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Describe the stranger and evil will be </v>

1458
01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:55.230
<v Speaker 3>used to describe things that go against </v>
<v Speaker 3>the car and moral code?</v>

1459
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:58.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have,</v>

1460
01:22:58.101 --> 01:22:58.934
<v Speaker 1>I not considered one to five my </v>
<v Speaker 1>terminology because because of that </v>

1461
01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:02.590
<v Speaker 1>likelihood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>

1462
01:23:03.890 --> 01:23:06.070
<v Speaker 3>are you not concerned?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It causes so</v>

1463
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:09.040
<v Speaker 5>much confusion to use,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to use the,</v>

1464
01:23:09.730 --> 01:23:12.820
<v Speaker 5>to use a word that has been used both as</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1465
01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:17.950
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>denial of anomalous information and also</v>

1466
01:23:17.951 --> 01:23:18.784
<v Speaker 5>the generation of new information </v>
<v Speaker 5>depending on the perspective of the </v>

1467
01:23:21.071 --> 01:23:24.100
<v Speaker 5>person who sets you apart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like are taking a very sophisticated use</v>

1468
01:23:24.101 --> 01:23:25.540
<v Speaker 5>of the word devil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1469
01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:26.433
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hopefully</v>

1470
01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:30.100
<v Speaker 5>your readers haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't have,</v>

1471
01:23:30.620 --> 01:23:32.770
<v Speaker 5>you're a sophisticated use of the word </v>
<v Speaker 5>devil.</v>

1472
01:23:33.610 --> 01:23:38.610
<v Speaker 5>The devil is the devil because in your </v>
<v Speaker 5>shoulder and mercy from God whispers bad</v>

1473
01:23:39.401 --> 01:23:40.860
<v Speaker 5>things in the area,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is what you know,</v>

1474
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.863
<v Speaker 5>and it tells you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it tells you that you should break away </v>

1475
01:23:43.391 --> 01:23:44.290
<v Speaker 5>from the long curved.</v>

1476
01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:46.370
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's all.</v>

1477
01:23:46.370 --> 01:23:48.690
<v Speaker 1>But that's also the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for example,</v>

1478
01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:50.730
<v Speaker 1>in this parallel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you brought up again,</v>

1479
01:23:51.150 --> 01:23:53.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean depending on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1480
01:23:53.341 --> 01:23:56.310
<v Speaker 1>so there's a guy in the ditch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's taking a sheep out of the whole,</v>

1481
01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:59.730
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason that he's doing it determines</v>

1482
01:23:59.731 --> 01:24:02.670
<v Speaker 1>the morality of the action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the fact of the action.</v>

1483
01:24:02.970 --> 01:24:07.440
<v Speaker 1>So the problem is is that it is the case</v>
<v Speaker 1>upon occasion that the thing that tempts</v>

1484
01:24:07.441 --> 01:24:12.390
<v Speaker 1>you away from group identification is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not the positive exploratory spirit.</v>

1485
01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:13.733
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1486
01:24:15.390 --> 01:24:16.223
<v Speaker 1>I would say there are two consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are two political consequences to </v>

1487
01:24:20.190 --> 01:24:22.920
<v Speaker 1>the refusal to admit to anomalous </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

1488
01:24:23.250 --> 01:24:25.920
<v Speaker 1>And one is the construction of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian state,</v>

1489
01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:30.180
<v Speaker 1>either as something that defines your </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality or as something that defines</v>

1490
01:24:30.181 --> 01:24:31.014
<v Speaker 1>your whole culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on how pervasive that </v>

1491
01:24:32.491 --> 01:24:33.324
<v Speaker 1>particular pattern of action is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the one I'm kind of most </v>

1492
01:24:35.791 --> 01:24:39.270
<v Speaker 1>interested in because it's being </v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian and fascist states that,</v>

1493
01:24:39.271 --> 01:24:42.240
<v Speaker 1>at least in the 20th century appeared </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've done the most damage.</v>

1494
01:24:42.570 --> 01:24:45.750
<v Speaker 1>But there's also another form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>political disintegration that that might</v>

1495
01:24:45.751 --> 01:24:50.250
<v Speaker 1>be more clearly classified as decadence </v>
<v Speaker 1>and decadence,</v>

1496
01:24:50.251 --> 01:24:55.251
<v Speaker 1>is the refusal to adhere to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a traditional morality to begin with,</v>

1497
01:24:56.610 --> 01:24:57.443
<v Speaker 1>justified by arguments such as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all archaic and useless </v>

1498
01:25:01.681 --> 01:25:04.560
<v Speaker 1>information to anyhow and free spirits </v>
<v Speaker 1>such as myself,</v>

1499
01:25:04.620 --> 01:25:05.453
<v Speaker 1>which means I'm disciplined and useless </v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures in their totality or actually </v>

1500
01:25:08.281 --> 01:25:10.590
<v Speaker 1>the kind of heroes who are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>transform the world.</v>

1501
01:25:11.070 --> 01:25:15.410
<v Speaker 1>So I would say that for people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>following the roof to decadence,</v>

1502
01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:17.340
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the devil talks,</v>

1503
01:25:17.341 --> 01:25:18.480
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1504
01:25:18.570 --> 01:25:21.900
<v Speaker 1>cultural rules are all tyrannical and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>

1505
01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:24.560
<v Speaker 1>So the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it the,</v>

1506
01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:25.633
<v Speaker 1>the interpretation of the process is </v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely context dependent and you </v>

1507
01:25:30.271 --> 01:25:31.104
<v Speaker 1>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't make it simple for that fact </v>

1508
01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:34.133
<v Speaker 1>because the same act in two different </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences can have two completely </v>

1509
01:25:37.681 --> 01:25:40.440
<v Speaker 1>different moral advances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nisha said at one point,</v>

1510
01:25:40.441 --> 01:25:41.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

1511
01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:44.190
<v Speaker 1>if you're out in the front of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>group,</v>

1512
01:25:44.490 --> 01:25:47.310
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you should make sure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you're not running away.</v>

1513
01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:48.960
<v Speaker 1>Like you're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1514
01:25:48.961 --> 01:25:50.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm going out here in front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am leading.</v>

1515
01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:53.220
<v Speaker 1>But the truth of the matter is you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>no be meeting at all.</v>

1516
01:25:53.670 --> 01:25:54.503
<v Speaker 1>You might just be running away as fast </v>
<v Speaker 1>as you can and using the idea of your </v>

1517
01:25:57.901 --> 01:26:00.630
<v Speaker 1>leadership to justify the fact that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just can't cut it.</v>

1518
01:26:01.410 --> 01:26:02.243
<v Speaker 1>And like a lot of what passes for </v>
<v Speaker 1>counter cultural creativity and </v>

1519
01:26:07.190 --> 01:26:08.023
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary thinking is not at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that heroic Willem wave from the </v>

1520
01:26:11.751 --> 01:26:16.740
<v Speaker 1>confines of group identification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but pure lack of disciplined,</v>

1521
01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:20.880
<v Speaker 1>a pure lack of discipline masquerading </v>
<v Speaker 1>as heroin.</v>

1522
01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:24.070
<v Speaker 1>And it's just as dangerous as fascist I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

1523
01:26:24.410 --> 01:26:25.243
<v Speaker 1>And it's also a precursor to fascism </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you get a society that </v>

1524
01:26:28.291 --> 01:26:29.124
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently disordered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that will produce is a tremendous </v>

1525
01:26:32.001 --> 01:26:35.720
<v Speaker 1>desire for the establishment of a rigid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rigid structure.</v>

1526
01:26:36.290 --> 01:26:39.890
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

1527
01:26:39.970 --> 01:26:40.540
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that,</v>

1528
01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:41.373
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I think that was just saying </v>

1529
01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:45.360
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the devil bagels is writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

1530
01:26:45.390 --> 01:26:46.040
<v Speaker 1>it's not the same.</v>

1531
01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Definitely the cheer writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you the,</v>

1532
01:26:49.091 --> 01:26:50.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's true,</v>

1533
01:26:50.601 --> 01:26:51.434
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way I can think of it is the </v>

1534
01:26:53.991 --> 01:26:56.180
<v Speaker 1>same in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question,</v>

1535
01:26:56.181 --> 01:26:57.014
<v Speaker 1>and I think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the issue is to develop a </v>

1536
01:26:58.251 --> 01:27:01.820
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently delineated notion of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutes evil.</v>

1537
01:27:02.090 --> 01:27:02.923
<v Speaker 1>So that we can see the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the things that are just </v>

1538
01:27:05.570 --> 01:27:06.403
<v Speaker 1>normally classified into that domain in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that should be classified </v>

1539
01:27:09.621 --> 01:27:11.700
<v Speaker 1>into the dome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1540
01:27:12.410 --> 01:27:14.480
<v Speaker 1>so symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it operates on many levels</v>

1541
01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:21.420
<v Speaker 1>to make sure you're talking about which </v>
<v Speaker 1>level you're referring to it on theirs.</v>

1542
01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:22.910
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to say.</v>

1543
01:27:22.911 --> 01:27:25.370
<v Speaker 1>We also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could have been referred to it since</v>

1544
01:27:25.371 --> 01:27:26.204
<v Speaker 1>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since what you're doing is this is the </v>

1545
01:27:27.501 --> 01:27:30.020
<v Speaker 1>whole mythology of the devil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1546
01:27:30.021 --> 01:27:32.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw you run into a problem like this,</v>

1547
01:27:32.061 --> 01:27:32.894
<v Speaker 1>we know familiar and is portable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Them see you're reading your demo is </v>

1548
01:27:36.201 --> 01:27:39.020
<v Speaker 1>from paradise lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a different depth.</v>

1549
01:27:39.070 --> 01:27:41.780
<v Speaker 1>I never read paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up with the devil,</v>

1550
01:27:41.781 --> 01:27:44.930
<v Speaker 1>which isn't the same devil once your </v>
<v Speaker 1>done reading very different.</v>

1551
01:27:45.110 --> 01:27:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1552
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:47.960
<v Speaker 1>You're a devil is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1553
01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:51.660
<v Speaker 1>is like the Godfather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1554
01:27:52.770 --> 01:27:53.750
<v Speaker 1>But well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

1555
01:27:53.751 --> 01:27:54.584
<v Speaker 1>I would say it is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is the case that what Milton do did </v>

1556
01:27:57.801 --> 01:27:58.634
<v Speaker 1>was attempt to codify what he saw as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental traditions of the devil and </v>

1557
01:28:02.901 --> 01:28:05.300
<v Speaker 1>Christian and True Christian mythology </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had be,</v>

1558
01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:08.090
<v Speaker 1>and it'd be gathered up to that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1559
01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:09.230
<v Speaker 1>here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1560
01:28:09.530 --> 01:28:12.320
<v Speaker 1>we know familiarity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's a natural tendency,</v>

1561
01:28:12.321 --> 01:28:13.154
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to assimilate the forerunner to the </v>

1562
01:28:15.141 --> 01:28:17.780
<v Speaker 1>dragon of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1563
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:18.663
<v Speaker 1>Is that it's not even an assimilation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural tendency of people to be </v>

1564
01:28:21.411 --> 01:28:24.290
<v Speaker 1>unable to distinguish the 400 from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dragon of chaos.</v>

1565
01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:25.333
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that dragon imagery plays a </v>

1566
01:28:26.871 --> 01:28:29.240
<v Speaker 1>large part in our mythology of evil.</v>

1567
01:28:29.630 --> 01:28:30.463
<v Speaker 1>So it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very easy for us to contaminate up </v>

1568
01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:34.010
<v Speaker 1>our notion of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1569
01:28:34.011 --> 01:28:36.620
<v Speaker 1>the serpentine aspect of evil with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreigner.</v>

1570
01:28:37.220 --> 01:28:38.810
<v Speaker 1>What I'm trying to do is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1571
01:28:38.811 --> 01:28:39.644
<v Speaker 1>look there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are some things that we tend </v>

1572
01:28:41.061 --> 01:28:43.800
<v Speaker 1>naturally to regard as evil because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're negatively valence,</v>

1573
01:28:44.230 --> 01:28:49.230
<v Speaker 1>that that are only tangentially in </v>
<v Speaker 1>situationally associated with evil.</v>

1574
01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:54.760
<v Speaker 1>But there is one thing at the core which</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a process that that is actually right</v>

1575
01:28:55.281 --> 01:29:00.281
<v Speaker 1>at the basis of the evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh and I'm,</v>

1576
01:29:00.431 --> 01:29:02.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to build up a map of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1577
01:29:02.910 --> 01:29:06.330
<v Speaker 1>of what that her a personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized by that process with me.</v>

1578
01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:07.141
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1579
01:29:07.141 --> 01:29:07.974
<v Speaker 1>well the first thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the totalitarian personality </v>

1580
01:29:12.090 --> 01:29:14.890
<v Speaker 1>rejects any notion of the possibility of</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal layer.</v>

1581
01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:18.990
<v Speaker 1>Now people sometimes hide from </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves when they're doing by saying,</v>

1582
01:29:18.991 --> 01:29:19.824
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't that I'm personally omnicell </v>

1583
01:29:21.020 --> 01:29:21.853
<v Speaker 1>and it's that I'm an adherence say of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Communist ideology and it's Communist </v>

1584
01:29:24.241 --> 01:29:24.810
<v Speaker 1>ideology.</v>

1585
01:29:24.810 --> 01:29:27.750
<v Speaker 1>That's absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just happened to believe it.</v>

1586
01:29:27.930 --> 01:29:28.763
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's just rationalization </v>
<v Speaker 1>is you get all of the advantages of </v>

1587
01:29:31.051 --> 01:29:34.650
<v Speaker 1>being on this yet without any of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without any of the disadvantages.</v>

1588
01:29:34.651 --> 01:29:36.000
<v Speaker 1>So it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

1589
01:29:36.210 --> 01:29:40.420
<v Speaker 1>really powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can see how arrogance is relating</v>

1590
01:29:40.421 --> 01:29:41.254
<v Speaker 1>to that without any problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's also the notion of this act </v>

1591
01:29:44.101 --> 01:29:47.520
<v Speaker 1>is there's an underlying notion there of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sacrifice of the hero,</v>

1592
01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:51.330
<v Speaker 1>which is also implicit in the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>notion of the rejection of the anomalous</v>

1593
01:29:51.331 --> 01:29:52.164
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause we said already that the positive </v>

1594
01:29:54.481 --> 01:29:55.314
<v Speaker 1>aspect of the individual is the aspect </v>
<v Speaker 1>that voluntarily admits to the presence </v>

1595
01:29:59.911 --> 01:30:03.900
<v Speaker 1>of anomalous information and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>modifies worldview,</v>

1596
01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:08.460
<v Speaker 1>either his coworkers or the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>society as a consequence of that contact</v>

1597
01:30:08.461 --> 01:30:09.294
<v Speaker 1>with no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's recognition of the </v>

1598
01:30:11.310 --> 01:30:12.143
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then exploration of the fact then </v>

1599
01:30:14.881 --> 01:30:15.714
<v Speaker 1>generation of an adaptive structure to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with the fact and then </v>

1600
01:30:17.941 --> 01:30:20.760
<v Speaker 1>communication of that adaptive structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out into this social community.</v>

1601
01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:24.360
<v Speaker 1>And that's the hero of pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well if you don't do that,</v>

1602
01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:27.360
<v Speaker 1>if you do the opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's tantamount to rejecting that</v>

1603
01:30:27.361 --> 01:30:28.194
<v Speaker 1>whole process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say that someone who refuses </v>

1604
01:30:30.841 --> 01:30:31.674
<v Speaker 1>to admit to the possibility of personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>error also sacrifices their identity </v>

1605
01:30:35.461 --> 01:30:37.980
<v Speaker 1>with the heroic aspect of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

1606
01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:40.530
<v Speaker 1>That's also a necessary consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you say,</v>

1607
01:30:40.531 --> 01:30:43.740
<v Speaker 1>well what are the consequences of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1608
01:30:43.741 --> 01:30:45.060
<v Speaker 1>the consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're simple.</v>

1609
01:30:45.930 --> 01:30:46.763
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only two ways of protecting </v>

1610
01:30:48.241 --> 01:30:49.074
<v Speaker 1>yourself against the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is by directing group </v>

1611
01:30:51.781 --> 01:30:55.650
<v Speaker 1>identification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other is by identifying with the</v>

1612
01:30:55.651 --> 01:30:59.100
<v Speaker 1>process that makes sense of the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most people do both.</v>

1613
01:30:59.101 --> 01:31:00.560
<v Speaker 1>And that's perfectly reasonable costs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1614
01:31:00.570 --> 01:31:02.760
<v Speaker 1>We had doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our group identifications,</v>

1615
01:31:02.761 --> 01:31:03.594
<v Speaker 1>and then we try to make sense of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are anomalous that happened </v>

1616
01:31:06.121 --> 01:31:08.580
<v Speaker 1>to us personally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a nice balance.</v>

1617
01:31:09.630 --> 01:31:11.370
<v Speaker 1>So you can either identify with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hero,</v>

1618
01:31:11.371 --> 01:31:13.800
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you can identify with the group.</v>

1619
01:31:14.130 --> 01:31:17.370
<v Speaker 1>If you forsake your identification with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hero voluntarily,</v>

1620
01:31:17.371 --> 01:31:21.810
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that you say there is no</v>
<v Speaker 1>such thing as anomalous information,</v>

1621
01:31:22.250 --> 01:31:23.083
<v Speaker 1>then the only thing that you've got left</v>
<v Speaker 1>to protect yourself with his </v>

1622
01:31:25.021 --> 01:31:25.854
<v Speaker 1>identification with the group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that makes the likelihood that </v>

1623
01:31:28.981 --> 01:31:31.590
<v Speaker 1>you'll identify rigidly with the group </v>
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

1624
01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:34.620
<v Speaker 1>much higher because you don't have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative anymore.</v>

1625
01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:39.240
<v Speaker 1>So like if you know that you can cope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then if someone comes along,</v>

1626
01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:41.473
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at this in terms of </v>

1627
01:31:42.181 --> 01:31:43.950
<v Speaker 1>personal relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like let's say you,</v>

1628
01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:47.940
<v Speaker 1>because I have a personal relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can adopt to totalitarian,</v>

1629
01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:49.713
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can adopt the totalitarian mode with no </v>

1630
01:31:52.891 --> 01:31:53.724
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you're extremely dependent on </v>

1631
01:31:56.611 --> 01:31:59.530
<v Speaker 1>the person that you're associating with </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1632
01:31:59.531 --> 01:32:01.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone threatened stuff person.</v>

1633
01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:03.183
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get extraordinarily </v>

1634
01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:09.420
<v Speaker 1>upset about this because you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrificed your own ability to deal with</v>

1635
01:32:09.611 --> 01:32:11.470
<v Speaker 1>that known through your dependency.</v>

1636
01:32:11.710 --> 01:32:12.543
<v Speaker 1>So you're much more likely to need the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person that you're with than would </v>

1637
01:32:15.641 --> 01:32:16.990
<v Speaker 1>otherwise be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1638
01:32:17.290 --> 01:32:18.123
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be so dependent on them </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to use all sorts of </v>

1639
01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:23.710
<v Speaker 1>vicious underground tricks to ensure </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they don't abandon you.</v>

1640
01:32:24.100 --> 01:32:24.933
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point is is that if you eliminate </v>

1641
01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:30.070
<v Speaker 1>this as a possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically the,</v>

1642
01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:31.053
<v Speaker 1>the theory runs like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you draw the conclusion that the </v>

1643
01:32:33.221 --> 01:32:36.700
<v Speaker 1>negative aspect of the unknown is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible that there's no possible way it</v>

1644
01:32:36.701 --> 01:32:37.534
<v Speaker 1>can be dealt with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is to say you're making the </v>

1645
01:32:40.001 --> 01:32:42.250
<v Speaker 1>presupposition that life is too terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>to bear.</v>

1646
01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:43.473
<v Speaker 1>As a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you eliminate your identification with </v>

1647
01:32:45.461 --> 01:32:48.070
<v Speaker 1>the positive aspect of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the individual.</v>

1648
01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:52.220
<v Speaker 1>That makes you much more likely to adopt</v>
<v Speaker 1>tie,</v>

1649
01:32:52.221 --> 01:32:55.240
<v Speaker 1>ironical identification with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal structure.</v>

1650
01:32:55.570 --> 01:32:56.403
<v Speaker 1>Cause you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a process that you can </v>

1651
01:32:57.731 --> 01:32:59.080
<v Speaker 1>actually engage in contacting.</v>

1652
01:32:59.130 --> 01:32:59.963
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

1653
01:33:00.850 --> 01:33:01.683
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

1654
01:33:02.790 --> 01:33:05.660
<v Speaker 1>it's also the case that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1655
01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:07.273
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1656
01:33:07.450 --> 01:33:08.283
<v Speaker 5>Is the opposite of work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What goes to the negatives there was if </v>

1657
01:33:11.471 --> 01:33:12.304
<v Speaker 5>you rejected them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>occasional group and only would be your </v>

1658
01:33:15.301 --> 01:33:16.134
<v Speaker 5>role.</v>

1659
01:33:16.930 --> 01:33:18.760
<v Speaker 1>The opposite of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well I would say,</v>

1660
01:33:18.810 --> 01:33:19.541
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1661
01:33:19.541 --> 01:33:24.541
<v Speaker 1>I would say [inaudible] is a consequence</v>
<v Speaker 1>of viewing the tyrannical ass of viewing</v>

1662
01:33:25.841 --> 01:33:26.674
<v Speaker 1>society is only tyrannical and seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as even more of a danger than the </v>

1663
01:33:30.491 --> 01:33:33.540
<v Speaker 1>negative aspect of the unknown because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it has a positive aspect too.</v>

1664
01:33:34.330 --> 01:33:38.270
<v Speaker 1>So I say in both cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decadence or fascism,</v>

1665
01:33:38.290 --> 01:33:39.760
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still characterized by,</v>

1666
01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:43.390
<v Speaker 1>by the elimination of identification </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the hero.</v>

1667
01:33:43.620 --> 01:33:46.210
<v Speaker 1>The hero is the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>True possible,</v>

1668
01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:49.900
<v Speaker 1>which is elimination of identification </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a group.</v>

1669
01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:52.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

1670
01:33:52.601 --> 01:33:53.351
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On that level.</v>

1671
01:33:53.351 --> 01:33:54.370
<v Speaker 1>That would be decadence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1672
01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:56.770
<v Speaker 1>Then that would be bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1673
01:33:57.130 --> 01:33:57.963
<v Speaker 1>If it's motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's actually motivated by the </v>

1674
01:34:00.011 --> 01:34:00.844
<v Speaker 1>inability to put up with any discipline </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the problem with like group </v>

1675
01:34:04.151 --> 01:34:04.984
<v Speaker 1>identification has a cost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have to follow the rules and </v>

1676
01:34:07.931 --> 01:34:10.510
<v Speaker 1>that's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now for some people,</v>

1677
01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:15.550
<v Speaker 1>the threat of following the rules is </v>
<v Speaker 1>more to be feared than the threat of the</v>

1678
01:34:15.551 --> 01:34:16.210
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>

1679
01:34:16.210 --> 01:34:18.320
<v Speaker 1>Especially given like if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>decadent,</v>

1680
01:34:18.321 --> 01:34:19.154
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to revel in all the positive </v>

1681
01:34:20.831 --> 01:34:23.380
<v Speaker 1>aspects of chaos as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get to,</v>

1682
01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:24.573
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have an ex exceptionally </v>

1683
01:34:25.841 --> 01:34:30.400
<v Speaker 1>promiscuous lifestyle and you use all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mood altering drugs you can get your</v>

1684
01:34:30.401 --> 01:34:33.640
<v Speaker 1>hands on and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you live for the pleasurable moment.</v>

1685
01:34:33.641 --> 01:34:36.340
<v Speaker 1>So I mean there's lots of positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects to chaos,</v>

1686
01:34:36.370 --> 01:34:37.203
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that are hidden from you by the </v>

1687
01:34:39.221 --> 01:34:43.870
<v Speaker 1>necessity of identifying with the group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't,</v>

1688
01:34:43.871 --> 01:34:46.430
<v Speaker 1>the thing that deck the decadence takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>place in a,</v>

1689
01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:51.070
<v Speaker 1>in a highly developed societies so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can sort of take for granted all the</v>

1690
01:34:51.150 --> 01:34:51.983
<v Speaker 1>politics society has given you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you're getting the </v>

1691
01:34:55.070 --> 01:34:58.060
<v Speaker 1>positive out of the unknown because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just sort of thing you're denying</v>

1692
01:34:58.080 --> 01:34:58.881
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to follow the rules,</v>

1693
01:34:58.881 --> 01:35:00.870
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling on all the time.</v>

1694
01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:03.110
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a short,</v>

1695
01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:04.303
<v Speaker 1>of course that's exactly the cakes is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're protected by the thing you </v>

1696
01:35:08.841 --> 01:35:11.480
<v Speaker 1>despise despite the fact that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>despise it.</v>

1697
01:35:11.481 --> 01:35:12.314
<v Speaker 1>It's so powerful that it can bear you </v>
<v Speaker 1>along while you're doing everything you </v>

1698
01:35:15.201 --> 01:35:16.550
<v Speaker 1>can to undermine it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1699
01:35:16.551 --> 01:35:18.370
<v Speaker 1>That happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1700
01:35:19.190 --> 01:35:20.023
<v Speaker 1>Nisha said at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is the kind of statement </v>

1701
01:35:22.791 --> 01:35:25.100
<v Speaker 1>that can be easily interpreted as </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascist and you know,</v>

1702
01:35:25.101 --> 01:35:26.420
<v Speaker 1>need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she gets interpreted that way now.</v>

1703
01:35:26.421 --> 01:35:29.270
<v Speaker 1>And then he said the strength of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>society can be measured by the number of</v>

1704
01:35:29.271 --> 01:35:31.650
<v Speaker 1>parasites that it can bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

1705
01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:34.070
<v Speaker 1>what he hit the point he was making was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the point you're making.</v>

1706
01:35:35.290 --> 01:35:37.570
<v Speaker 2>So although,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1707
01:35:37.571 --> 01:35:40.600
<v Speaker 2>you can see how taking out the context </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that statement perhaps</v>

1708
01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:42.973
<v Speaker 2>well can be viewed as support for an </v>
<v Speaker 2>exceptionally powerful right wing </v>

1709
01:35:46.290 --> 01:35:47.060
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>

1710
01:35:47.060 --> 01:35:47.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1711
01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:50.630
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not getting at it yet exactly what I</v>

1712
01:35:50.631 --> 01:35:52.460
<v Speaker 1>want to get at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have a personality.</v>

1713
01:35:52.730 --> 01:35:55.430
<v Speaker 1>It's characterized by all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary consequences.</v>

1714
01:35:55.730 --> 01:35:57.680
<v Speaker 1>There's no anomaly that's equivalent to </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

1715
01:35:57.681 --> 01:35:59.670
<v Speaker 1>I know everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1716
01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:01.273
<v Speaker 1>identity identification with the group </v>
<v Speaker 1>is also equivalent to rejection of the </v>

1717
01:36:04.380 --> 01:36:06.890
<v Speaker 1>heroic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the other thing is,</v>

1718
01:36:06.891 --> 01:36:07.724
<v Speaker 1>is that right?</v>

1719
01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:18.770
<v Speaker 2>That's the motive that I really want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get at.</v>

1720
01:36:25.830 --> 01:36:28.860
<v Speaker 1>The idea I guess is that the development</v>
<v Speaker 1>of self consciousness,</v>

1721
01:36:28.861 --> 01:36:31.810
<v Speaker 1>which means knowledge of mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1722
01:36:32.850 --> 01:36:36.900
<v Speaker 1>heightens the negative valence of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown to such a degree where it's easy</v>

1723
01:36:36.901 --> 01:36:41.610
<v Speaker 1>to draw the logical conclusion that life</v>
<v Speaker 1>is such an unfair process than it should</v>

1724
01:36:41.611 --> 01:36:45.150
<v Speaker 1>be brought to an end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I wanted to read you a quote from,</v>

1725
01:36:46.380 --> 01:36:51.380
<v Speaker 1>from Girtha mean characterizes </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mephistopheles,</v>

1726
01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:53.433
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1727
01:36:57.730 --> 01:36:58.563
<v Speaker 1>Mephistopheles central thesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So mephistopheles means Prince of lies </v>

1728
01:37:03.750 --> 01:37:04.583
<v Speaker 1>and alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another attribute of the </v>

1729
01:37:06.131 --> 01:37:06.964
<v Speaker 1>classical devil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course the lie is that anomalous </v>

1730
01:37:09.941 --> 01:37:13.600
<v Speaker 1>information that upsets your particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>system of belief doesn't exist.</v>

1731
01:37:13.601 --> 01:37:16.000
<v Speaker 1>That's what characterizes and lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

1732
01:37:16.001 --> 01:37:19.240
<v Speaker 1>Mephistopheles has an express credo and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes something like this.</v>

1733
01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:24.370
<v Speaker 1>The spirit I that endlessly denies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>rightly too,</v>

1734
01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:29.520
<v Speaker 1>for all that comes to birth is fit for </v>
<v Speaker 1>overthrow as nothing worth wherefore the</v>

1735
01:37:29.741 --> 01:37:31.330
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're better sterilized.</v>

1736
01:37:31.810 --> 01:37:32.643
<v Speaker 1>That's all that's here is evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognized his gain to me and downfall </v>

1737
01:37:35.561 --> 01:37:38.470
<v Speaker 1>runes sin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very element type prosper in.</v>

1738
01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:44.560
<v Speaker 1>And guess that repeats that philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 1>in part two of files.</v>

1739
01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:48.130
<v Speaker 1>T says this is memphis softly speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1740
01:37:48.490 --> 01:37:52.630
<v Speaker 1>gone to share,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing passed with no made one.</v>

1741
01:37:53.110 --> 01:37:55.150
<v Speaker 1>What manages our creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>endless toil.</v>

1742
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:56.183
<v Speaker 1>When Adis snatch oblivion ends the coil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the question that's posed in </v>

1743
01:37:59.071 --> 01:37:59.790
<v Speaker 1>genesis.</v>

1744
01:37:59.790 --> 01:38:02.850
<v Speaker 1>It is by gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How shall this riddle run?</v>

1745
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:08.130
<v Speaker 1>As good as if things never had begun yet</v>
<v Speaker 1>circleback existence to possess.</v>

1746
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:09.143
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather have eternal emptiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So mephistopheles credo is basically </v>

1747
01:38:14.461 --> 01:38:19.461
<v Speaker 1>that the evidence implies that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions of existence are sufficiently</v>

1748
01:38:19.741 --> 01:38:20.574
<v Speaker 1>unfair in and of themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such that it would be better if nothing </v>

1749
01:38:23.461 --> 01:38:24.294
<v Speaker 1>existed at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that's that conclusion </v>

1750
01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:28.231
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1751
01:38:28.231 --> 01:38:29.064
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to conclusion that people draw from </v>

1752
01:38:30.241 --> 01:38:32.610
<v Speaker 1>time to time on the basis of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence that exists.</v>

1753
01:38:32.850 --> 01:38:33.683
<v Speaker 1>But I would also say that if you abandon</v>
<v Speaker 1>your identification with the process </v>

1754
01:38:37.621 --> 01:38:38.454
<v Speaker 1>that makes order out of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the conclusion that you </v>

1755
01:38:40.351 --> 01:38:41.184
<v Speaker 1>necessarily have to draw as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the nature of your </v>

1756
01:38:43.801 --> 01:38:44.634
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you eliminate from your life </v>

1757
01:38:47.851 --> 01:38:48.684
<v Speaker 1>all those things that are positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which occur as a consequence of your </v>

1758
01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:53.670
<v Speaker 1>voluntary tendency to move out into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

1759
01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:54.593
<v Speaker 1>all that you'll be left with necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>is constantly evidence of the existence </v>

1760
01:38:58.441 --> 01:39:01.020
<v Speaker 1>of unwarranted pain and suffering.</v>

1761
01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:02.153
<v Speaker 1>And under those conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only logical conclusion to draw is </v>

1762
01:39:04.201 --> 01:39:05.034
<v Speaker 1>that any state of existence that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized by constant in one </v>

1763
01:39:08.610 --> 01:39:09.443
<v Speaker 1>unwarranted pain and suffering obviously</v>
<v Speaker 1>deserves to be youth and angst </v>

1764
01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:13.633
<v Speaker 1>eradicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's the motive that </v>

1765
01:39:16.171 --> 01:39:21.171
<v Speaker 1>underlies the acts of genocide that </v>
<v Speaker 1>accompany totalitarian thinking.</v>

1766
01:39:22.310 --> 01:39:23.143
<v Speaker 1>But here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's recent biography of Stellan </v>

1767
01:39:25.381 --> 01:39:27.030
<v Speaker 1>published.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only read a review of it.</v>

1768
01:39:27.260 --> 01:39:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Two books actually I want to pick up </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have been written very recently.</v>

1769
01:39:30.481 --> 01:39:31.314
<v Speaker 1>They are very relevant to this course </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of them based on archive </v>

1770
01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:35.550
<v Speaker 1>material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1771
01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:37.493
<v Speaker 1>the biographer reveals that still in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of person that we've been </v>

1772
01:39:40.411 --> 01:39:42.570
<v Speaker 1>describing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was an extraordinary and cruel</v>

1773
01:39:42.571 --> 01:39:44.160
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rigid totalitarian,</v>

1774
01:39:44.161 --> 01:39:45.990
<v Speaker 1>paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1775
01:39:45.991 --> 01:39:46.824
<v Speaker 1>what was his plan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This biography thinks there's a good </v>

1776
01:39:48.841 --> 01:39:49.674
<v Speaker 1>possibility that he was murdered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a good thing by all </v>

1777
01:39:52.411 --> 01:39:53.990
<v Speaker 1>appearances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1778
01:39:54.270 --> 01:39:58.590
<v Speaker 1>it looks like what stolen was doing pr </v>
<v Speaker 1>prior to his demise was,</v>

1779
01:39:58.780 --> 01:39:59.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he like his,</v>

1780
01:39:59.550 --> 01:40:00.383
<v Speaker 1>his acts of evil had escalated in </v>
<v Speaker 1>magnitude over the course of the years </v>

1781
01:40:03.241 --> 01:40:04.140
<v Speaker 1>that he was in power.</v>

1782
01:40:04.380 --> 01:40:05.213
<v Speaker 1>And as he got more and more powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that domain of visibility to put his </v>

1783
01:40:08.791 --> 01:40:13.791
<v Speaker 1>evil fantasies into action increased </v>
<v Speaker 1>this burger for claims that Stellan near</v>

1784
01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:18.630
<v Speaker 1>in the years that led up to his death </v>
<v Speaker 1>was in facts planning to start a nuclear</v>

1785
01:40:18.631 --> 01:40:19.464
<v Speaker 1>war with the West.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that all of the systematic acts of </v>

1786
01:40:22.501 --> 01:40:23.334
<v Speaker 1>genocide that he had committed in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union might be regarded as trial </v>

1787
01:40:26.581 --> 01:40:28.620
<v Speaker 1>runs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I would think of as practice.</v>

1788
01:40:28.621 --> 01:40:31.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first person is hard to kill,</v>

1789
01:40:31.190 --> 01:40:32.023
<v Speaker 1>but once you kill one person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the second person isn't so hard </v>

1790
01:40:33.631 --> 01:40:34.800
<v Speaker 1>to kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once you get to,</v>

1791
01:40:34.801 --> 01:40:38.430
<v Speaker 1>well it's not so hard to wipe out 20 and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe once you're pretty good at that,</v>

1792
01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:39.653
<v Speaker 1>a thousand doesn't bother you anymore </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can practice on a few </v>

1793
01:40:42.270 --> 01:40:43.103
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if that really doesn't distress you </v>

1794
01:40:44.041 --> 01:40:45.960
<v Speaker 1>too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then there's always the possibility</v>

1795
01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:47.700
<v Speaker 1>of blowing up the whole world.</v>

1796
01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:49.920
<v Speaker 1>And that's what motivated Stella.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

1797
01:40:50.150 --> 01:40:53.290
<v Speaker 1>and I would also say that those of us </v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

1798
01:40:53.710 --> 01:40:54.543
<v Speaker 1>who tend to think of people like Stellan</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Hitler as entirely foreign entities </v>

1799
01:40:57.940 --> 01:40:59.680
<v Speaker 1>haven't come to term with the sock </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms,</v>

1800
01:40:59.681 --> 01:41:00.514
<v Speaker 1>with the fact that there's a big chunk </v>
<v Speaker 1>of our personality whose credo is </v>

1801
01:41:03.401 --> 01:41:04.234
<v Speaker 1>precisely that have Mephistopheles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that the world and its </v>

1802
01:41:07.211 --> 01:41:08.044
<v Speaker 1>conditions are so unfair in reality that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best thing we could possibly happen </v>

1803
01:41:12.750 --> 01:41:15.670
<v Speaker 1>would be for all this to come to an end </v>
<v Speaker 1>as rapidly as possible.</v>

1804
01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:17.860
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that under normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions,</v>

1805
01:41:18.490 --> 01:41:19.323
<v Speaker 1>we work out of this part of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality and this part of our </v>

1806
01:41:21.431 --> 01:41:22.264
<v Speaker 1>personality too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And generally it's a tossup which part </v>

1807
01:41:24.311 --> 01:41:28.360
<v Speaker 1>gets the upper hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to the degree that this part gets the</v>

1808
01:41:28.361 --> 01:41:29.890
<v Speaker 1>upper hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty constant,</v>

1809
01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:35.560
<v Speaker 1>the likelihood of a tear radical state </v>
<v Speaker 1>increases in in magnitude.</v>

1810
01:41:35.950 --> 01:41:37.240
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1811
01:41:37.780 --> 01:41:40.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a ridiculous argument because the</v>

1812
01:41:40.151 --> 01:41:40.984
<v Speaker 1>actions of one individual don't have any</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to the consequences at the </v>

1813
01:41:44.081 --> 01:41:44.914
<v Speaker 1>level of any political maneuvering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would say we don't have the </v>

1814
01:41:48.191 --> 01:41:50.500
<v Speaker 1>foggiest clue what causes things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Holocaust.</v>

1815
01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:54.100
<v Speaker 1>We don't know why the Cold War started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We certainly have no idea why it ended.</v>

1816
01:41:54.310 --> 01:41:55.143
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's premature to conclude on the basis </v>

1817
01:41:58.151 --> 01:41:58.984
<v Speaker 1>of hard evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ignorance and our inability to stop </v>

1818
01:42:00.881 --> 01:42:01.714
<v Speaker 1>things like the Holocaust from occurring</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have no idea how the actions of </v>

1819
01:42:04.961 --> 01:42:07.990
<v Speaker 1>the individual might be related to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>development of genocide states.</v>

1820
01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:13.330
<v Speaker 1>So I'm suggesting that they might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive much more closely than people have</v>

1821
01:42:13.331 --> 01:42:17.590
<v Speaker 1>been inclined to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm also suggesting that part of the</v>

1822
01:42:17.591 --> 01:42:18.424
<v Speaker 1>reason that people have been inclined to</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that they're not very closely </v>

1823
01:42:21.071 --> 01:42:21.904
<v Speaker 1>aligned is well because well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because of the individual </v>

1824
01:42:25.241 --> 01:42:26.074
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the magnitude that individual </v>

1825
01:42:27.401 --> 01:42:29.140
<v Speaker 1>responsibility that seems to imply</v>

1826
01:42:39.670 --> 01:42:42.600
<v Speaker 2>processes all the flies.</v>

1827
01:42:44.710 --> 01:42:45.543
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think you can even make a </v>

1828
01:42:46.931 --> 01:42:50.590
<v Speaker 1>physiological argument to buttress that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

1829
01:42:50.591 --> 01:42:51.424
<v Speaker 1>which is that</v>

1830
01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:54.233
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that you're engaged in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>constant in the constant voluntary </v>

1831
01:42:58.501 --> 01:42:59.334
<v Speaker 1>processing of anomalous information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life is interesting and meaningful </v>

1832
01:43:03.300 --> 01:43:04.740
<v Speaker 1>by definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1833
01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:09.150
<v Speaker 1>the circuitry that you activate when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're engaged in voluntary exploration,</v>

1834
01:43:09.390 --> 01:43:14.390
<v Speaker 1>which is a consequence of admission of </v>
<v Speaker 1>anomaly is in fact what we call meaning.</v>

1835
01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:17.430
<v Speaker 1>And to the degree that you're engaged in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a meaningful activity,</v>

1836
01:43:17.610 --> 01:43:18.443
<v Speaker 1>you can put up with all the nasty </v>
<v Speaker 1>preconditions of existence that make </v>

1837
01:43:21.601 --> 01:43:25.730
<v Speaker 1>that sort of exploration possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which nature said if you have a,</v>

1838
01:43:26.130 --> 01:43:26.963
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you can bear any how and basically </v>

1839
01:43:29.431 --> 01:43:30.264
<v Speaker 1>what he meant by that visit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Despite the fact that life perhaps </v>

1840
01:43:34.351 --> 01:43:38.820
<v Speaker 1>necessarily has terrible preconditions </v>
<v Speaker 1>for it to exist at all,</v>

1841
01:43:39.090 --> 01:43:39.923
<v Speaker 1>it might be rendered bearable and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive if you would only participate </v>

1842
01:43:44.251 --> 01:43:46.530
<v Speaker 1>in those things that you know to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

1843
01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a reasonable hypothesis.</v>

1844
01:43:50.070 --> 01:43:51.950
<v Speaker 1>It's also what everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if</v>

1845
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:56.090
<v Speaker 4>you could discover what it is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone would want,</v>

1846
01:43:56.780 --> 01:43:59.390
<v Speaker 4>if they could really figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 4>they wanted,</v>

1847
01:43:59.540 --> 01:44:00.373
<v Speaker 4>that would be it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because the story says if you pursue </v>

1848
01:44:02.811 --> 01:44:03.644
<v Speaker 4>those things that you personally find </v>
<v Speaker 4>most meaningful without deceiving </v>

1849
01:44:06.801 --> 01:44:07.634
<v Speaker 4>yourself as to their content,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what will happen is that you'll develop </v>

1850
01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:11.623
<v Speaker 4>a mode of being that enables you to look</v>
<v Speaker 4>on life as if it was a beneficial </v>

1851
01:44:16.611 --> 01:44:17.444
<v Speaker 4>process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that is what people want when they </v>

1852
01:44:19.761 --> 01:44:21.110
<v Speaker 4>say something like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1853
01:44:21.111 --> 01:44:24.980
<v Speaker 4>what is like given this terrible thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just happened to me?</v>

1854
01:44:24.981 --> 01:44:27.650
<v Speaker 4>What could possibly be the meaning of my</v>
<v Speaker 4>existence.</v>

1855
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:33.790
<v Speaker 4>Say Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1856
01:44:44.110 --> 01:44:47.300
<v Speaker 4>I have your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have almost all of your papers aren't.</v>

1857
01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:50.830
<v Speaker 4>It was two of them that aren't mark and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll have them ready on Friday.</v>
