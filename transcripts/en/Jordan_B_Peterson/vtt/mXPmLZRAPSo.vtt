1
00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.870
<v Speaker 1>It's January 13th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2019.</v>

2
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.710
<v Speaker 1>Happy New Year to you all and thank you </v>
<v Speaker 1>for joining the</v>

3
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.220
<v Speaker 1>q and a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

4
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.143
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll start with a couple of </v>

5
00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:19.884
<v Speaker 1>announcements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first I suppose is that I'm leaving </v>

6
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.400
<v Speaker 1>Patrion January 15th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of you may know that that's,</v>

7
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.473
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in protest over their treatment of Carl </v>

8
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.393
<v Speaker 1>Benjamin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a perhaps better known as Sargon of a </v>

9
00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:42.201
<v Speaker 1>cad I'm patron like many companies seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>to believe that their role now is to act</v>

10
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:44.844
<v Speaker 1>as sensor for speech patterns or speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>content that they regard as </v>

11
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.900
<v Speaker 1>unacceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

12
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.240
<v Speaker 1>I think that they made a big mistake </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Sargon and so both Dave Rubin and I</v>

13
00:00:57.241 --> 00:00:58.074
<v Speaker 1>and also Sam Harris have decided to </v>
<v Speaker 1>leave patron and that's going to be </v>

14
00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:02.454
<v Speaker 1>official as of January 15th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those of you who are my patron on </v>

15
00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:08.634
<v Speaker 1>subscribers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're interested in continuing with </v>

16
00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:11.634
<v Speaker 1>that subscription,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go to my website at Jordan b </v>

17
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.570
<v Speaker 1>Peterson Dotcom and there's a support </v>
<v Speaker 1>button there,</v>

18
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the menu and you can use that system.</v>

19
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm also trying to design a system that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle,</v>

20
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.470
<v Speaker 1>might work as a reasonable replacement </v>
<v Speaker 1>for patriotic.</v>

21
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.530
<v Speaker 1>That's a couple of months away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're working hard on it.</v>

22
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.943
<v Speaker 1>We're getting legal advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to set up multiple payment </v>

23
00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:36.534
<v Speaker 1>channels so that it won't be easy for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to be kicked off by credit card </v>

24
00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:46.461
<v Speaker 1>companies or let's call them virtue </v>
<v Speaker 1>signaling a ethical types who think that</v>

25
00:01:49.351 --> 00:01:50.184
<v Speaker 1>their role is to police free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think this is a very bad precedent </v>

26
00:01:54.601 --> 00:01:56.820
<v Speaker 1>that patronage is set and the credit </v>
<v Speaker 1>card companies to.</v>

27
00:01:56.821 --> 00:01:57.654
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine it's difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine a more dystopian scenario than </v>

28
00:02:02.011 --> 00:02:02.844
<v Speaker 1>to have the large tech companies in </v>
<v Speaker 1>combination with the credit card </v>

29
00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:08.214
<v Speaker 1>companies monitor your spending to </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide when what you're doing is </v>

30
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:11.904
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently ethical by their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the standards of the people who are </v>

31
00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:17.124
<v Speaker 1>running their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call them safety and security </v>

32
00:02:19.231 --> 00:02:22.830
<v Speaker 1>speech monitoring programs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just such a terrible idea.</v>

33
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.470
<v Speaker 1>So there's that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

34
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.610
<v Speaker 1>that I'm also working on my new book </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a lot,</v>

35
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.000
<v Speaker 1>but actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

36
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.213
<v Speaker 1>it's tentatively titled Beyond Order </v>
<v Speaker 1>Twelve more rules for life or perhaps </v>

37
00:02:39.871 --> 00:02:43.260
<v Speaker 1>beyond mere order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't decided on that yet.</v>

38
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.090
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you what the rules are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you'd be interested in that.</v>

39
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.530
<v Speaker 1>So I'll give you a list of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first one is,</v>

40
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.940
<v Speaker 1>do not carelessly denigrates social </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions or creative achievement</v>

41
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.590
<v Speaker 1>rule to imagine who you could be and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then aim singlemindedly at that.</v>

42
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.610
<v Speaker 1>Rule three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>work as hard as you can,</v>

43
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.120
<v Speaker 1>work as hard as you possibly can on at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least one thing and see what happens.</v>

44
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.433
<v Speaker 1>Rule four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do not hide unwanted things in the fog </v>

45
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.450
<v Speaker 1>rule five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>abandoned ideology,</v>

46
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.150
<v Speaker 1>abandoned ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rule six,</v>

47
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.000
<v Speaker 1>notice that opportunity lurks where </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility has been abdicated.</v>

48
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.470
<v Speaker 1>Rule seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do not do things that you hate.</v>

49
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:42.563
<v Speaker 1>Rule eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to make one room in your house as </v>

50
00:03:44.551 --> 00:03:47.940
<v Speaker 1>beautiful as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rule Nine,</v>

51
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.433
<v Speaker 1>if all memories still make you cry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right them down carefully and </v>

52
00:03:53.461 --> 00:03:54.294
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>

53
00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.290
<v Speaker 1>Rule Ten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plan and work diligently to maintain the</v>

54
00:04:00.291 --> 00:04:04.250
<v Speaker 1>romance in your relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rule Eleven,</v>

55
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.460
<v Speaker 1>be grateful in spite of your suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then rule 12,</v>

56
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.320
<v Speaker 1>do not allow yourself to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful,</v>

57
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.060
<v Speaker 1>deceitful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or arrogant.</v>

58
00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:15.643
<v Speaker 1>In principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that book will be published in January </v>

59
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.320
<v Speaker 1>20 slash 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

60
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.273
<v Speaker 1>and I'm supposed to have the manuscript </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometime within the next six months </v>

61
00:04:25.221 --> 00:04:29.420
<v Speaker 1>and I have a first draft done and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>working hard on the repeated edits,</v>

62
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.533
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be published similar in </v>

63
00:04:32.841 --> 00:04:35.540
<v Speaker 1>the UK and the US and Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

64
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.433
<v Speaker 1>I'm working with three different editors</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's that part of the </v>

65
00:04:40.941 --> 00:04:41.774
<v Speaker 1>announcement and so I'm hoping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really hoping that I can make the </v>

66
00:04:44.181 --> 00:04:46.440
<v Speaker 1>next book better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it would be a pair,</v>

67
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.100
<v Speaker 1>it'll be a paired copy with the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

68
00:04:49.101 --> 00:04:49.934
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably going to publish it with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>black cover to go with the white cover </v>

69
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:53.523
<v Speaker 1>of 12 rules and I'm hoping that I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it into a better book and that the </v>

70
00:04:57.201 --> 00:04:59.480
<v Speaker 1>two together will make a very complete </v>
<v Speaker 1>set.</v>

71
00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.140
<v Speaker 1>So that's the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see how it goes.</v>

72
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.660
<v Speaker 1>The last announcement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

73
00:05:05.661 --> 00:05:06.980
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two more announcements.</v>

74
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to Switzerland tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

75
00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.730
<v Speaker 1>my daughter's having surgery there to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get her ankle fixed again.</v>

76
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.923
<v Speaker 1>We're hoping that that will go well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm also doing a talk in Zurich and I </v>

77
00:05:21.201 --> 00:05:25.070
<v Speaker 1>have three talks in California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Information for them,</v>

78
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.780
<v Speaker 1>Miss Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>b Peterson,</v>

79
00:05:26.781 --> 00:05:31.610
<v Speaker 1>dark com forward slash events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in February,</v>

80
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.590
<v Speaker 1>my wife and I are going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife,</v>

81
00:05:33.591 --> 00:05:38.060
<v Speaker 1>Tammy and I are going to Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand and I believe we have 15,</v>

82
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.900
<v Speaker 1>a talk scheduled there over the course </v>
<v Speaker 1>of about a month.</v>

83
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:43.723
<v Speaker 1>And then I think in March and April I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to concentrate mostly on writing </v>

84
00:05:46.131 --> 00:05:48.470
<v Speaker 1>and then perhaps we're going to go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>

85
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:49.783
<v Speaker 1>And so that's for a month or two that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will depend to some degree on the </v>

86
00:05:52.491 --> 00:05:55.550
<v Speaker 1>writing schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the plan at the moment.</v>

87
00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.380
<v Speaker 1>I have some good podcasts up.</v>

88
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.213
<v Speaker 1>I talked to General Stanley mcchrystal </v>
<v Speaker 1>last week about his new book on </v>

89
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:05.270
<v Speaker 1>leadership and the myths that surround </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

90
00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.213
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of the initiatives that he's </v>

91
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:12.530
<v Speaker 1>been working on in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what crystal was the commander of</v>

92
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.393
<v Speaker 1>the American forces in Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it was very interesting to talk </v>

93
00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:19.310
<v Speaker 1>to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

94
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.720
<v Speaker 1>well there's a variety of other things </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on too,</v>

95
00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:27.410
<v Speaker 1>but I won't tell you anymore about those</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the time being.</v>

96
00:06:27.411 --> 00:06:30.050
<v Speaker 1>I think what I'll do instead is turning </v>
<v Speaker 1>to some questions.</v>

97
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.890
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

98
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.770
<v Speaker 1>I guess maybe I could also give a bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a recap for 2018,</v>

99
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.240
<v Speaker 1>so tammy and I have gone to about 115 </v>
<v Speaker 1>cities now,</v>

100
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:42.283
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her Google a trip trackers showed that </v>

101
00:06:46.101 --> 00:06:49.880
<v Speaker 1>she had gone six times around the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>mindset 20.</v>

102
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.480
<v Speaker 1>And so that's obviously wrong because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>traveled mostly with her,</v>

103
00:06:53.481 --> 00:06:58.481
<v Speaker 1>but there was a lot of traveling last </v>
<v Speaker 1>year I spoke to about 250,000 people and</v>

104
00:06:58.521 --> 00:06:59.354
<v Speaker 1>that was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that was very positive </v>

105
00:07:01.101 --> 00:07:04.460
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lectures have been really,</v>

106
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:05.783
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

107
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart warming to use an old term.</v>

108
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's really something to see that</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people gathered together and,</v>

109
00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:16.590
<v Speaker 1>and listen and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

110
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.880
<v Speaker 1>and participate in a discussion about</v>

111
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.983
<v Speaker 2>about</v>

112
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:22.403
<v Speaker 1>psychological and philosophical and </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual issues that as deep as I can </v>

113
00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:29.814
<v Speaker 1>manage anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it seems to be quite gripping for </v>

114
00:07:32.071 --> 00:07:34.440
<v Speaker 1>the audience and good for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they're very,</v>

115
00:07:34.441 --> 00:07:35.274
<v Speaker 1>very positive experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is partly why we've been able to </v>

116
00:07:38.581 --> 00:07:42.900
<v Speaker 1>sustain this speaking pace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's been good.</v>

117
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:47.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we also have a discount by the way.</v>

118
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.250
<v Speaker 1>My partners and I decided to,</v>

119
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:52.603
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

120
00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:53.723
<v Speaker 1>encourage everybody to make their new </v>
<v Speaker 1>year's resolutions in a sophisticated </v>

121
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.840
<v Speaker 1>and comprehensive way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we have this program,</v>

122
00:08:03.841 --> 00:08:04.674
<v Speaker 1>some of you have heard about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this@selfauthoring.com called future </v>

123
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:09.163
<v Speaker 1>authoring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the future authoring program helps </v>

124
00:08:11.221 --> 00:08:12.054
<v Speaker 1>you write out a vision for the future to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think through what you'd like your life </v>

125
00:08:17.011 --> 00:08:19.950
<v Speaker 1>to be like if you were taking care of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself properly,</v>

126
00:08:19.951 --> 00:08:20.784
<v Speaker 1>to consider your friends and your family</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your career and your education and </v>

127
00:08:24.511 --> 00:08:29.100
<v Speaker 1>your use of time outside of work and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your ability to resist temptation,</v>

128
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.080
<v Speaker 1>that kind of temptation that might drag </v>
<v Speaker 1>you down and a</v>

129
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.340
<v Speaker 1>and how you might take care of yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally and physically.</v>

130
00:08:37.341 --> 00:08:39.890
<v Speaker 1>And to write about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then to write a counter,</v>

131
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:44.420
<v Speaker 1>a story which was where you might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>three to five years down the road if you</v>

132
00:08:44.421 --> 00:08:46.430
<v Speaker 1>let all your bad habits get out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

133
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.720
<v Speaker 1>And then to write a strategic plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very useful program.</v>

134
00:08:50.721 --> 00:08:53.480
<v Speaker 1>We've used it with lots of university </v>
<v Speaker 1>students in particular,</v>

135
00:08:53.481 --> 00:08:55.830
<v Speaker 1>although it's for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for adults of all ages.</v>

136
00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.073
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're a university student and </v>

137
00:08:59.101 --> 00:08:59.934
<v Speaker 1>you complete the program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to increase the probability </v>

138
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:04.710
<v Speaker 1>that you'll stay in university by about </v>
<v Speaker 1>25 percent,</v>

139
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:06.230
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

140
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.120
<v Speaker 1>it seems particularly useful by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for men,</v>

141
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:11.820
<v Speaker 1>for reasons that we don't exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>

142
00:09:11.821 --> 00:09:12.654
<v Speaker 1>maybe because they're underperforming </v>
<v Speaker 1>women academically and it also improves </v>

143
00:09:16.531 --> 00:09:17.364
<v Speaker 1>people's grades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a large literature in the </v>

144
00:09:19.681 --> 00:09:24.450
<v Speaker 1>industrial organizational area also </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicating that if you're,</v>

145
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:25.343
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're working and you make a </v>

146
00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:28.374
<v Speaker 1>personal plan of this sort and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>overall productivity increases by about </v>

147
00:09:32.521 --> 00:09:35.390
<v Speaker 1>10 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a lot and you're,</v>

148
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.070
<v Speaker 1>you're more likely to be physically and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally healthy.</v>

149
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.340
<v Speaker 1>And so I would really recommend trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

150
00:09:41.341 --> 00:09:42.174
<v Speaker 1>Even you can try the program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do a perfect job at </v>

151
00:09:44.581 --> 00:09:45.414
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really matter because you're </v>

152
00:09:46.441 --> 00:09:47.274
<v Speaker 1>trying to set out a bit of a vision and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a plan for your life and you need that </v>

153
00:09:49.831 --> 00:09:50.664
<v Speaker 1>because you need direction and you need </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose and you need the constraints of </v>

154
00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:57.210
<v Speaker 1>a vision to help you be less anxious and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncertain.</v>

155
00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.230
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

156
00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:03.450
<v Speaker 1>you have that anxiety and uncertainty </v>
<v Speaker 1>reduction does occur.</v>

157
00:10:03.451 --> 00:10:06.360
<v Speaker 1>If you have a decent map of where it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're headed,</v>

158
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.720
<v Speaker 1>the coupon code is [inaudible] 2019,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Year's 2019 and why 2019.</v>

159
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:14.663
<v Speaker 1>And if you go to the self authoring site</v>
<v Speaker 1>and click on the product's a menu item </v>

160
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.673
<v Speaker 1>and go to future author and you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>just enter in that coupon code and it's </v>

161
00:10:24.841 --> 00:10:25.674
<v Speaker 1>50 percent off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think the total price is $7 and </v>

162
00:10:28.111 --> 00:10:31.560
<v Speaker 1>forty five cents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is actually pretty damn cheap.</v>

163
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.890
<v Speaker 1>If what it does is help structure your </v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

164
00:10:34.891 --> 00:10:37.020
<v Speaker 1>And I really do think this is a helpful </v>
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>

165
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:37.883
<v Speaker 1>We've worked on it a lot and tested lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's based on solid behavioral </v>

166
00:10:42.121 --> 00:10:42.954
<v Speaker 1>psychological principles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lie with I would say a certain degree </v>

167
00:10:45.781 --> 00:10:48.540
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of optimistic philosophy.</v>

168
00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:50.610
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

169
00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:52.103
<v Speaker 2>well</v>

170
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.380
<v Speaker 1>it's a good thing to do</v>

171
00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:56.850
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

172
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.360
<v Speaker 1>this is a good time to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're interested,</v>

173
00:11:00.361 --> 00:11:03.330
<v Speaker 1>all that information will be in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>description of the video as well.</v>

174
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.500
<v Speaker 1>So that's basically that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

175
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.983
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I have anything else to </v>

176
00:11:09.331 --> 00:11:11.250
<v Speaker 1>tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

177
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm 12 rules for life has sold about 3 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million copies now.</v>

178
00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.130
<v Speaker 1>So I guess I'm telling you that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

179
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:21.060
<v Speaker 1>it's become very popular in Korea where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it sold about 200,000 copies,</v>

180
00:11:21.061 --> 00:11:24.660
<v Speaker 1>which is quite interesting in something </v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have necessarily expected.</v>

181
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:27.010
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

182
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:32.090
<v Speaker 1>So let's answer some questions and see </v>
<v Speaker 1>how that goes.</v>

183
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.433
<v Speaker 1>Can you talk about your own specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences slash methods used with </v>

184
00:11:37.921 --> 00:11:41.040
<v Speaker 1>integrating the shadow?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

185
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:43.560
<v Speaker 1>well I can actually,</v>

186
00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:50.490
<v Speaker 1>I think a tremendous amount of what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might regard as shadow integration,</v>

187
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:52.503
<v Speaker 1>which in the parlance of behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists would be something like </v>

188
00:11:56.741 --> 00:11:58.360
<v Speaker 1>assertiveness training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

189
00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.900
<v Speaker 1>It's training and how to stand up for </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and for your,</v>

190
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.340
<v Speaker 1>let's say for your better self,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be the self that you can use</v>

191
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:07.263
<v Speaker 1>productively over a medium to long </v>
<v Speaker 1>period of time that would be of use to </v>

192
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:13.570
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also views to people around you.</v>

193
00:12:13.571 --> 00:12:18.571
<v Speaker 1>So it's a self that's founded by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity of taking care of yourself,</v>

194
00:12:19.151 --> 00:12:22.060
<v Speaker 1>but also simultaneously taking care of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people around you.</v>

195
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:23.423
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

196
00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:31.510
<v Speaker 1>I think that the simplest way to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>that work is to consult your resentment.</v>

197
00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:34.653
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to become bitter about life </v>

198
00:12:36.701 --> 00:12:37.534
<v Speaker 1>and to become angry because of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>life is difficult and it's full of </v>

199
00:12:41.351 --> 00:12:42.184
<v Speaker 1>disappointments and people are also </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject to be trail on the part of </v>

200
00:12:46.901 --> 00:12:49.900
<v Speaker 1>themselves and the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically care for them.</v>

201
00:12:49.901 --> 00:12:50.734
<v Speaker 1>And so it's easy to get bitter and to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful and resentment is a very </v>

202
00:12:55.451 --> 00:12:58.210
<v Speaker 1>useful emotion even though I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most,</v>

203
00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:02.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>damaging emotions if it's not dealt with</v>

204
00:13:02.081 --> 00:13:02.914
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're resentful basically means </v>

205
00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:06.783
<v Speaker 1>only one of two things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it either means you should grow up and </v>

206
00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:14.041
<v Speaker 1>quit whining and get on with your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>or it means that you're being subject to</v>

207
00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:19.510
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical forces of one form or another</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe emanating from you.</v>

208
00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.730
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a consequence of the natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

209
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.350
<v Speaker 1>maybe a consequence of society.</v>

210
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:24.423
<v Speaker 1>You're being subject to tyrannical </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces and you're not putting your own </v>

211
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:30.423
<v Speaker 1>best interests forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in that broader sense that I </v>

212
00:13:33.041 --> 00:13:35.380
<v Speaker 1>described.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't mean you're selfish,</v>

213
00:13:35.381 --> 00:13:40.381
<v Speaker 1>narrow interests that only serve the </v>
<v Speaker 1>purposes of instantaneous gratification.</v>

214
00:13:40.481 --> 00:13:41.314
<v Speaker 1>I mean your own best interest in terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>of developing your character over the </v>

215
00:13:44.441 --> 00:13:47.410
<v Speaker 1>span of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're resentful,</v>

216
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.370
<v Speaker 1>it either means that you're immature and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you should grow the hell up,</v>

217
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:52.263
<v Speaker 1>and so you need to figure out how much </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your resentment is is is that and </v>

218
00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:00.250
<v Speaker 1>maybe allied with the desire to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>other things or people to blame,</v>

219
00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:05.760
<v Speaker 1>but the other possible option is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have something to say or do,</v>

220
00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:07.023
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're in a situation where </v>

221
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.353
<v Speaker 1>you're violating your own internal </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethical standards and you're being </v>

222
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:14.853
<v Speaker 1>required pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say to say things you don't </v>

223
00:14:17.021 --> 00:14:22.021
<v Speaker 1>believe or to do things that you believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be wrong and you need to determine.</v>

224
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:27.490
<v Speaker 1>You need to start to strategize and plan</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you can rectify that so that you can</v>

225
00:14:27.491 --> 00:14:28.324
<v Speaker 1>say what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're negotiating with a </v>

226
00:14:29.651 --> 00:14:31.000
<v Speaker 1>marital partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

227
00:14:31.001 --> 00:14:35.560
<v Speaker 1>and there are issues in your marriage </v>
<v Speaker 1>that aren't making you happy.</v>

228
00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing is you have to take note</v>

229
00:14:37.691 --> 00:14:38.291
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

230
00:14:38.291 --> 00:14:40.720
<v Speaker 1>To see that you're actually unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

231
00:14:40.721 --> 00:14:44.140
<v Speaker 1>the second is that you have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to engage in a certain amount of</v>

232
00:14:44.141 --> 00:14:47.720
<v Speaker 1>conflict because in order to sort out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's disturbing you,</v>

233
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:51.710
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to lay your </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerns out on the table and say,</v>

234
00:14:51.711 --> 00:14:53.060
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is bothering me.</v>

235
00:14:53.061 --> 00:14:54.050
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

236
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:57.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm right and you're wrong and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fix this.</v>

237
00:14:57.291 --> 00:14:58.250
<v Speaker 1>You have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

238
00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:59.173
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern of interaction or lack of </v>

239
00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:08.861
<v Speaker 1>interaction say in our relationship is </v>
<v Speaker 1>making me resentful and angry,</v>

240
00:15:09.201 --> 00:15:10.034
<v Speaker 1>and the danger of that of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you're going to take it out on </v>

241
00:15:11.781 --> 00:15:14.520
<v Speaker 1>yourself and your partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dangerous Passion,</v>

242
00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.010
<v Speaker 1>passive aggressiveness.</v>

243
00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:17.223
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to respond to your </v>

244
00:15:17.661 --> 00:15:20.800
<v Speaker 1>partner positively when they do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something good if you're resentful about</v>

245
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.960
<v Speaker 1>and you're not going to respond to </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself properly.</v>

246
00:15:23.961 --> 00:15:27.410
<v Speaker 1>So you have to lay it out on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But sort of in a spirit of ignorance,</v>

247
00:15:27.411 --> 00:15:28.550
<v Speaker 1>humility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

248
00:15:28.551 --> 00:15:30.320
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm frustrated.</v>

249
00:15:30.321 --> 00:15:32.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm feeling this way about our </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

250
00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.450
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I think might be going </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

251
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.433
<v Speaker 1>Maybe on my part and maybe on your part </v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's what I envisioned as a </v>

252
00:15:39.801 --> 00:15:40.634
<v Speaker 1>possible solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also really necessary if you're </v>

253
00:15:43.071 --> 00:15:43.904
<v Speaker 1>going to say what you have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to manifest yourself properly </v>

254
00:15:47.391 --> 00:15:50.810
<v Speaker 1>in the world is you can't just complain </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what's wrong.</v>

255
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:52.100
<v Speaker 1>You have to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

256
00:15:52.101 --> 00:15:55.520
<v Speaker 1>what would my minimal preconditions for </v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction be?</v>

257
00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:00.760
<v Speaker 1>You have to offer that to the person </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're negotiating with and so then</v>

258
00:16:00.891 --> 00:16:01.724
<v Speaker 1>you learn to abide by the truth to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree that you can do that and no one </v>

259
00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:06.320
<v Speaker 1>does it perfectly.</v>

260
00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:07.583
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very useful because you're not </v>

261
00:16:11.391 --> 00:16:12.224
<v Speaker 1>storing up a whole sequence of memories </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how you were unfairly treated and </v>

262
00:16:18.201 --> 00:16:20.660
<v Speaker 1>abused and betrayed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

263
00:16:20.661 --> 00:16:21.494
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to stay on top of it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to note your unhappiness and </v>

264
00:16:24.261 --> 00:16:25.094
<v Speaker 1>dissatisfaction when it manifests itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to accept that that's the case and </v>

265
00:16:29.451 --> 00:16:32.330
<v Speaker 1>then to analyze that to see if it's your</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

266
00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:33.223
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with regards to maturity or if it </v>

267
00:16:34.551 --> 00:16:35.384
<v Speaker 1>indicates that there's an injustice in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the manner in which you and the world </v>

268
00:16:40.911 --> 00:16:41.744
<v Speaker 1>are interacting and then to work to set </v>
<v Speaker 1>that right even in small ways and so </v>

269
00:16:45.471 --> 00:16:47.900
<v Speaker 1>it's a matter of character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>logical development,</v>

270
00:16:47.901 --> 00:16:48.734
<v Speaker 1>and that makes you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes you stronger over time and </v>

271
00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:54.050
<v Speaker 1>partly what you need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

272
00:16:54.051 --> 00:16:56.390
<v Speaker 1>in order to do that is you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>really understand,</v>

273
00:16:56.391 --> 00:16:57.224
<v Speaker 1>and we do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why we built in the future </v>

274
00:16:59.331 --> 00:17:00.110
<v Speaker 1>authoring program.</v>

275
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:04.250
<v Speaker 1>We built this section where you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>outline your most dismal future,</v>

276
00:17:04.251 --> 00:17:05.084
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What your future would be like if you </v>

277
00:17:05.991 --> 00:17:06.824
<v Speaker 1>let all your bad habits and </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterological weaknesses have the </v>

278
00:17:09.381 --> 00:17:10.214
<v Speaker 1>upper hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason we did this is because </v>

279
00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:17.780
<v Speaker 1>you can't be a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't straighten yourself out merely</v>

280
00:17:17.781 --> 00:17:18.614
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you lay out a vision for the </v>

281
00:17:20.781 --> 00:17:22.760
<v Speaker 1>future and you think about what your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life would be,</v>

282
00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:24.860
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you'd like your life to be like,</v>

283
00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:25.903
<v Speaker 1>and then that makes you hopeful and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivates you because it gives you </v>

284
00:17:27.711 --> 00:17:30.860
<v Speaker 1>something worthwhile and higher order to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work for.</v>

285
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:32.690
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's useful,</v>

286
00:17:32.691 --> 00:17:33.524
<v Speaker 1>that's positive emotion working for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>because positive emotion is experienced </v>

287
00:17:36.651 --> 00:17:37.484
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not as not as useful as also </v>

288
00:17:40.011 --> 00:17:40.844
<v Speaker 1>being chased by something you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrified by and if you have a good </v>

289
00:17:44.001 --> 00:17:48.380
<v Speaker 1>sense of how you'd fall apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you stayed week and just exactly what</v>

290
00:17:48.381 --> 00:17:49.800
<v Speaker 1>kind of hell that would be.</v>

291
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:50.933
<v Speaker 1>Then when you determined to do something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to tell the truth and to say what </v>

292
00:17:54.511 --> 00:17:56.940
<v Speaker 1>you think and to not do things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate,</v>

293
00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:58.463
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to be pulled along by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the purpose that your vision has </v>

294
00:18:01.921 --> 00:18:02.754
<v Speaker 1>provided for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also pushed along by your desire to </v>

295
00:18:05.491 --> 00:18:06.324
<v Speaker 1>avoid the worst forms of hail that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've already outlined for yourself </v>

296
00:18:08.941 --> 00:18:09.774
<v Speaker 1>personally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that can also help you be brave </v>

297
00:18:11.911 --> 00:18:16.410
<v Speaker 1>enough to stand up in a situation that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we would require a conflict.</v>

298
00:18:16.411 --> 00:18:17.244
<v Speaker 1>Because if you have something to say and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have something to negotiate about </v>

299
00:18:21.721 --> 00:18:22.554
<v Speaker 1>with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's going to be a certain </v>

300
00:18:23.641 --> 00:18:25.580
<v Speaker 1>amount of conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jewel dialogue,</v>

301
00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:29.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that accompanies that right to,</v>

302
00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.473
<v Speaker 1>to lay out a set of problems and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>describe the fact forthrightly that </v>

303
00:18:34.741 --> 00:18:36.720
<v Speaker 1>those problems characterize a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

304
00:18:36.721 --> 00:18:37.554
<v Speaker 1>And then to seek for solutions is quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>stressful in the short term and it's </v>

305
00:18:41.671 --> 00:18:45.210
<v Speaker 1>really easy to avoid and so people </v>
<v Speaker 1>avoided all the time and then they store</v>

306
00:18:45.211 --> 00:18:46.044
<v Speaker 1>up grievances across the span of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships and eventually the </v>

307
00:18:50.101 --> 00:18:50.934
<v Speaker 1>grievances mount to the point where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>return in monstrous forum and just eat </v>

308
00:18:54.541 --> 00:18:55.374
<v Speaker 1>everything up.</v>

309
00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:59.130
<v Speaker 1>That's where you get divorces or that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you explode at your boss and ended</v>

310
00:18:59.131 --> 00:18:59.964
<v Speaker 1>up fired or that's where you know you </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop high blood pressure over 15 </v>

311
00:19:03.451 --> 00:19:08.170
<v Speaker 1>years because he can't stand all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulated a monster,</v>

312
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:09.503
<v Speaker 1>all the accumulated monsters in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>closet and then you drink yourself into </v>

313
00:19:12.781 --> 00:19:14.820
<v Speaker 1>oblivion because he can't stand to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

314
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.180
<v Speaker 1>That's all you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very counterproductive,</v>

315
00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:19.283
<v Speaker 1>but it's easy to avoid that necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict on a moment to moment basis </v>

316
00:19:22.861 --> 00:19:27.861
<v Speaker 1>because it's very stressful to speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>forthrightly about genuine conflicts,</v>

317
00:19:28.141 --> 00:19:30.630
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>important parts of your life.</v>

318
00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:31.883
<v Speaker 1>But otherwise you don't straighten them </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and then you have to carry all that </v>

319
00:19:33.991 --> 00:19:34.824
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need to be terrified of the </v>

320
00:19:36.361 --> 00:19:37.194
<v Speaker 1>consequences of not speaking your piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that can counterbalance the terror </v>

321
00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:46.320
<v Speaker 1>of actually trying to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation so well,</v>

322
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:47.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you also have to look with regards </v>

323
00:19:48.751 --> 00:19:53.751
<v Speaker 1>to the shadow ideas like you have to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>in touch with the depths of your anger.</v>

324
00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:55.883
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of people are resentful about all </v>

325
00:19:57.391 --> 00:19:58.224
<v Speaker 1>sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're resentful about old women and </v>

326
00:20:01.261 --> 00:20:02.094
<v Speaker 1>they're resentful about men and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful about the patriarchy and </v>

327
00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.273
<v Speaker 1>they're resentful about the left wing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and resentful about the right wing and </v>

328
00:20:08.161 --> 00:20:11.740
<v Speaker 1>the resentful about politicians and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're resentful about the,</v>

329
00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:16.770
<v Speaker 1>like the cataclysmic force of nature and</v>
<v Speaker 1>its ability to make people sick and,</v>

330
00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:18.523
<v Speaker 1>and suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they are resentful about their own </v>

331
00:20:20.881 --> 00:20:21.714
<v Speaker 1>inadequacies in the boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're bad parenting and God like the </v>

332
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.800
<v Speaker 1>list is just bloody endless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that can make you very,</v>

333
00:20:28.801 --> 00:20:29.634
<v Speaker 1>very angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of that resentment and </v>

334
00:20:31.681 --> 00:20:32.514
<v Speaker 1>cynical and bitter and dark and full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasies about destruction and the </v>

335
00:20:36.421 --> 00:20:39.900
<v Speaker 1>desire to bring things down and the wish</v>
<v Speaker 1>that everyone else suffered.</v>

336
00:20:39.901 --> 00:20:42.450
<v Speaker 1>And the desire to shake your fist at </v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

337
00:20:42.451 --> 00:20:45.480
<v Speaker 1>And all of that's really dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

338
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:46.710
<v Speaker 1>young said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

339
00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:47.573
<v Speaker 1>the shadow human shout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it extends all the way down to hell and </v>

340
00:20:50.171 --> 00:20:52.180
<v Speaker 1>he really meant that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

341
00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:53.253
<v Speaker 1>because all the terrible things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are motivated to do are </v>

342
00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:02.500
<v Speaker 1>associated with that shadow domain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like none of you are any,</v>

343
00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.590
<v Speaker 1>none of you are saints in any </v>
<v Speaker 1>likelihood.</v>

344
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:07.870
<v Speaker 1>You have a terrible capacity for </v>
<v Speaker 1>destructiveness.</v>

345
00:21:07.871 --> 00:21:11.680
<v Speaker 1>And when you start to consult your </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment and to see how angry you are,</v>

346
00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:14.410
<v Speaker 1>it can terrify you to see the depths of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that anger.</v>

347
00:21:14.411 --> 00:21:17.620
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes that'll manifest itself in </v>
<v Speaker 1>very destructive fantasies.</v>

348
00:21:17.621 --> 00:21:18.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

349
00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:22.600
<v Speaker 1>which you might not want to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious of because they're so.</v>

350
00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

351
00:21:25.151 --> 00:21:25.984
<v Speaker 1>And so aggressive that you can't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that you generate them the nice </v>

352
00:21:28.901 --> 00:21:30.820
<v Speaker 1>person that's you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

353
00:21:30.821 --> 00:21:34.030
<v Speaker 1>so it's quite frightening to open the </v>
<v Speaker 1>door and see all that.</v>

354
00:21:34.031 --> 00:21:39.031
<v Speaker 1>And that also associates you with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire dark shadow of mankind,</v>

355
00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:40.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sate,</v>

356
00:21:40.151 --> 00:21:40.984
<v Speaker 1>tannic element of the human character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And but it opens the door to </v>

357
00:21:44.351 --> 00:21:45.860
<v Speaker 1>understanding as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

358
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:47.023
<v Speaker 1>to understanding how people can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible things because you could see </v>

359
00:21:49.271 --> 00:21:51.970
<v Speaker 1>yourself as one of the people who could </v>
<v Speaker 1>do terrible things.</v>

360
00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.630
<v Speaker 1>That's really useful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

361
00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:54.993
<v Speaker 1>because then you.</v>

362
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:56.103
<v Speaker 1>Well then maybe you start to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated to be the sort of person who </v>

363
00:21:58.871 --> 00:22:00.790
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't do terrible things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

364
00:22:00.791 --> 00:22:04.390
<v Speaker 1>if you can really come to terms with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that that's part and parcel of you.</v>

365
00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.433
<v Speaker 1>It also is some in perverse sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also a discovery of your own </v>

366
00:22:08.951 --> 00:22:10.510
<v Speaker 1>strength though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

367
00:22:10.511 --> 00:22:15.390
<v Speaker 1>if you have that desire for aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that desire for destruction and that,</v>

368
00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.273
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ability to fantasize in that </v>

369
00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:19.203
<v Speaker 1>aggressive manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also means that you can incorporate </v>

370
00:22:21.191 --> 00:22:22.024
<v Speaker 1>some of that into your speech and into </v>
<v Speaker 1>your actions so that you're a lot more </v>

371
00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.850
<v Speaker 1>immovable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

372
00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:28.743
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot more of a force to contend </v>

373
00:22:31.931 --> 00:22:32.764
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can give you some respect for </v>

374
00:22:34.091 --> 00:22:34.924
<v Speaker 1>yourself when you realize that you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>force of destruction as well as </v>

375
00:22:37.631 --> 00:22:38.464
<v Speaker 1>creation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you're also more likely to </v>

376
00:22:39.701 --> 00:22:42.700
<v Speaker 1>treat yourself with a bit more </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent caution.</v>

377
00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:44.213
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know that you're a part of you is a </v>

378
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:50.240
<v Speaker 1>ticking bomb in some sense that could go</v>
<v Speaker 1>off and so you,</v>

379
00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:51.203
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try a bit more lightly around </v>

380
00:22:52.421 --> 00:22:53.254
<v Speaker 1>yourself and had maybe you encourage </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to tread more lightly around you </v>

381
00:22:56.801 --> 00:22:59.200
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which isn't such a bad thing and all the</v>

382
00:22:59.201 --> 00:23:00.034
<v Speaker 1>people that I really admire that I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a clearly dangerous side and you </v>

383
00:23:04.241 --> 00:23:05.074
<v Speaker 1>don't want to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to have that activated </v>

384
00:23:08.741 --> 00:23:09.574
<v Speaker 1>any more than necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also what makes them </v>

385
00:23:11.411 --> 00:23:12.244
<v Speaker 1>respectable and strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they have that under </v>

386
00:23:14.111 --> 00:23:15.760
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

387
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.433
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a bit of a dialogue about shadow </v>

388
00:23:18.671 --> 00:23:20.380
<v Speaker 1>integration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very</v>

389
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.850
<v Speaker 1>challenging undertaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

390
00:23:24.851 --> 00:23:25.684
<v Speaker 1>to pull in that dark side of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>character and that would be all the </v>

391
00:23:30.431 --> 00:23:35.420
<v Speaker 1>things that you've repressed or failed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to develop as a consequence of trying to</v>

392
00:23:35.421 --> 00:23:37.280
<v Speaker 1>be a harmless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

393
00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:38.803
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

394
00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:40.910
<v Speaker 1>well let's say a harmless and</v>

395
00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 1>harmless citizen who looks virtuous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The surface,</v>

396
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:47.023
<v Speaker 1>that's the union persona.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you need that because everybody </v>

397
00:23:50.091 --> 00:23:53.270
<v Speaker 1>needs a mask that they wear in public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a suit,</v>

398
00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:54.283
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that we can tolerate seeing each </v>

399
00:23:57.171 --> 00:23:58.004
<v Speaker 1>other on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to look right into our </v>

400
00:23:59.751 --> 00:24:02.870
<v Speaker 1>depths every time we interact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need that persona.</v>

401
00:24:02.871 --> 00:24:03.704
<v Speaker 1>But that has to be transcended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way to transcend that is to </v>

402
00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.360
<v Speaker 1>integrate the darker parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

403
00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.310
<v Speaker 1>They're very useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That aggression,</v>

404
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:15.560
<v Speaker 1>that sexual demand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

405
00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.400
<v Speaker 1>all of that very difficult to socialize </v>
<v Speaker 1>that competitiveness,</v>

406
00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:23.300
<v Speaker 1>but unbelievably useful in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>force of character,</v>

407
00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.560
<v Speaker 1>if you can manage it.</v>

408
00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:29.743
<v Speaker 1>Richard asked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can I help my parents to sort </v>

409
00:24:31.491 --> 00:24:34.410
<v Speaker 1>themselves out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's question one.</v>

410
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:38.340
<v Speaker 1>How can I talk about the resentments of </v>
<v Speaker 1>my childhood in a way that benefits them</v>

411
00:24:38.341 --> 00:24:40.850
<v Speaker 1>instead of giving them guilt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

412
00:24:40.851 --> 00:24:42.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are two very difficult questions.</v>

413
00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:46.310
<v Speaker 1>How can you help your parents to sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves out?</v>

414
00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the first question would be,</v>

415
00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:51.553
<v Speaker 1>do they want to sort themselves out </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not that easy to help </v>

416
00:24:55.641 --> 00:25:00.320
<v Speaker 1>people if they don't want to be helped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they do want to be helped.</v>

417
00:25:00.321 --> 00:25:03.530
<v Speaker 1>Like listening is really a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy.</v>

418
00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:05.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

419
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.690
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got the question right,</v>

420
00:25:08.691 --> 00:25:09.524
<v Speaker 1>because you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can I help my parents to sort </v>

421
00:25:11.211 --> 00:25:12.044
<v Speaker 1>themselves out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very different than how can I </v>

422
00:25:13.491 --> 00:25:14.324
<v Speaker 1>sort my parents out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You help people to sort themselves out </v>

423
00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:19.973
<v Speaker 1>once they have decided to do so by </v>
<v Speaker 1>giving them the opportunity to talk </v>

424
00:25:24.871 --> 00:25:25.704
<v Speaker 1>about their concerns and also to outline</v>
<v Speaker 1>what potential solutions might be and </v>

425
00:25:30.091 --> 00:25:30.924
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to offer too many pieces </v>
<v Speaker 1>of advice while you're doing that </v>

426
00:25:34.441 --> 00:25:39.441
<v Speaker 1>because it turns out that people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>much more likely to implement a strategy</v>

427
00:25:39.721 --> 00:25:42.300
<v Speaker 1>of improvement if they generate it </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

428
00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:45.120
<v Speaker 1>And then also you don't steal the </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplishment from them.</v>

429
00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:48.150
<v Speaker 1>Like let's say you came to me with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of problems and I said,</v>

430
00:25:48.151 --> 00:25:50.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what you can do about that.</v>

431
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.890
<v Speaker 1>And then you went out and did it and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked.</v>

432
00:25:54.891 --> 00:25:57.380
<v Speaker 1>And then in some sense that's not your </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplishment.</v>

433
00:25:57.381 --> 00:25:59.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is in so far as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>implemented,</v>

434
00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:03.380
<v Speaker 1>but it's not in so far as it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that I planned.</v>

435
00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:07.820
<v Speaker 1>And your intimation of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your integration of the fact that the</v>

436
00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.193
<v Speaker 1>delight in success in the responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>for six success might have been stolen </v>

437
00:26:14.821 --> 00:26:15.654
<v Speaker 1>from you by well meaning advice is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to interfere with the probability that </v>

438
00:26:20.281 --> 00:26:21.114
<v Speaker 1>you'll implement the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's best to let people talk </v>

439
00:26:25.691 --> 00:26:27.310
<v Speaker 1>through their own problems like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

440
00:26:27.311 --> 00:26:29.860
<v Speaker 1>what's the problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you asked,</v>

441
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.823
<v Speaker 1>what's the problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think is not right about </v>

442
00:26:31.971 --> 00:26:32.804
<v Speaker 1>your life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then people will throw out a bunch </v>

443
00:26:34.161 --> 00:26:38.270
<v Speaker 1>of things that they're complaining about</v>
<v Speaker 1>or resentful about and it might be quite</v>

444
00:26:38.271 --> 00:26:39.104
<v Speaker 1>an extensive list and they'll feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>guilty about it because they don't want </v>

445
00:26:41.031 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 1>to burden you with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they need to it all off their chest,</v>

446
00:26:44.221 --> 00:26:45.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need to get the cards on the table.</v>

447
00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:46.883
<v Speaker 1>It's also something to know when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to your wife or your husband or </v>

448
00:26:49.201 --> 00:26:51.690
<v Speaker 1>your intimate partner or child for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

449
00:26:51.691 --> 00:26:53.520
<v Speaker 1>So when you have a close relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this,</v>

450
00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:55.800
<v Speaker 1>if they've got some things to complain </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

451
00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:56.753
<v Speaker 1>which they undoubtedly do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to complain about a lot </v>

452
00:26:59.671 --> 00:27:00.504
<v Speaker 1>more things than they're actually upset </v>
<v Speaker 1>about because they'll have gathered up </v>

453
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:04.913
<v Speaker 1>irritations that have been unspoken and </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggravations and fears and they'll all </v>

454
00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:11.094
<v Speaker 1>be upsetting them emotionally and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know exactly what they are until </v>

455
00:27:15.331 --> 00:27:16.960
<v Speaker 1>they articulate that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

456
00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:17.611
<v Speaker 1>we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

457
00:27:17.611 --> 00:27:18.690
<v Speaker 1>what are you upset about?</v>

458
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:19.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

459
00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:21.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you not know?</v>

460
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.433
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer is there's all sorts of </v>

461
00:27:23.221 --> 00:27:26.430
<v Speaker 1>things that you respond to emotionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you can articulate them.</v>

462
00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:27.563
<v Speaker 1>Then you get upset and you explode and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you yell and you lay out all the things </v>

463
00:27:30.271 --> 00:27:31.104
<v Speaker 1>you might be angry about and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulsive and you overstate your case </v>

464
00:27:33.541 --> 00:27:36.630
<v Speaker 1>and you accused people of things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't even believe.</v>

465
00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.950
<v Speaker 1>All of that's part of the process of </v>
<v Speaker 1>laying your cards out on the table.</v>

466
00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:42.443
<v Speaker 1>You have complex situations that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>disturbing you and you don't know what </v>

467
00:27:45.601 --> 00:27:47.790
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And exactly you have to kind of guess.</v>

468
00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:48.541
<v Speaker 1>So you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

469
00:27:48.541 --> 00:27:50.430
<v Speaker 1>it might be this and it might be that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it might be this,</v>

470
00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:53.130
<v Speaker 1>it might be you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is why it's your fault.</v>

471
00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:58.530
<v Speaker 1>You get accused and then if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to all that,</v>

472
00:27:58.650 --> 00:27:59.483
<v Speaker 1>you have to just be patient and let the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person get all their cards out on the </v>

473
00:28:04.231 --> 00:28:04.560
<v Speaker 1>table.</v>

474
00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Even if some of that involves </v>
<v Speaker 1>accusations about you,</v>

475
00:28:07.531 --> 00:28:08.364
<v Speaker 1>which you don't have to immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to immediately jumped to </v>

476
00:28:10.471 --> 00:28:11.304
<v Speaker 1>the conclusion that those accusations </v>
<v Speaker 1>are accurate to that you have to defend </v>

477
00:28:14.041 --> 00:28:15.450
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

478
00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:16.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe me,</v>

479
00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:18.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying this is easy because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

480
00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:19.913
<v Speaker 1>but you listen to the person lay out </v>
<v Speaker 1>their their deck of complaints and the </v>

481
00:28:23.491 --> 00:28:24.324
<v Speaker 1>first thing you'll find is that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>will take 50 percent or maybe more 75 </v>

482
00:28:28.621 --> 00:28:31.500
<v Speaker 1>percent of the cards off the table right</v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

483
00:28:31.501 --> 00:28:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Because once they've articulated out </v>
<v Speaker 1>those concerns,</v>

484
00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.470
<v Speaker 1>they'll find that they're not really </v>
<v Speaker 1>central.</v>

485
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:38.333
<v Speaker 1>They're not really the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that leaves a smaller number of </v>

486
00:28:41.101 --> 00:28:45.360
<v Speaker 1>genuine problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can ask people again,</v>

487
00:28:45.361 --> 00:28:46.890
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem.</v>

488
00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:48.053
<v Speaker 1>Can you think of any way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could conceptualize how things </v>

489
00:28:51.631 --> 00:28:54.270
<v Speaker 1>would be better in relationship to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

490
00:28:54.271 --> 00:28:55.104
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would a solution look like even in </v>

491
00:28:56.401 --> 00:28:59.760
<v Speaker 1>principle and then they might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

492
00:28:59.761 --> 00:29:00.594
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they have to guess and lay </v>

493
00:29:01.831 --> 00:29:02.664
<v Speaker 1>their cards out on the table about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>a solution might look like if they say </v>

494
00:29:05.791 --> 00:29:06.624
<v Speaker 1>they don't know that often means they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to think about it and a </v>

495
00:29:09.691 --> 00:29:10.524
<v Speaker 1>little bit of encouragement isn't in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order and maybe a little bit of </v>

496
00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:14.350
<v Speaker 1>pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

497
00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:15.893
<v Speaker 1>but you want people to formulate a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vision of what the situation would look </v>

498
00:29:18.361 --> 00:29:20.010
<v Speaker 1>like if the problem was solved.</v>

499
00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:21.083
<v Speaker 1>And then they might find it very </v>
<v Speaker 1>daunting because the solution looks so </v>

500
00:29:23.461 --> 00:29:25.740
<v Speaker 1>difficult that they don't see any </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathway to it.</v>

501
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.470
<v Speaker 1>And so then the next part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion is,</v>

502
00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:29.393
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are there some things that you could do </v>

503
00:29:31.321 --> 00:29:32.154
<v Speaker 1>that would be small steps that you would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be interested in doing that you think </v>

504
00:29:35.671 --> 00:29:39.180
<v Speaker 1>you would do that would move you to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution?</v>

505
00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.380
<v Speaker 1>And maybe those things could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>implemented.</v>

506
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Tentatively behavioral psychologists </v>
<v Speaker 1>call that collaborative empiricism.</v>

507
00:29:45.971 --> 00:29:46.804
<v Speaker 1>So you'll come and see a behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist and lay out your problems </v>

508
00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:52.510
<v Speaker 1>and then the two of you will negotiate </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards,</v>

509
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginnings of a solution.</v>

510
00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:58.990
<v Speaker 1>What could you do this week that might </v>
<v Speaker 1>make that problem slightly better?</v>

511
00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:03.910
<v Speaker 1>And so you talked through what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>practical and what's implementable,</v>

512
00:30:03.911 --> 00:30:04.744
<v Speaker 1>and you have to be honest about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't want to set yourself </v>

513
00:30:07.571 --> 00:30:09.430
<v Speaker 1>up with a plan that's so complicated.</v>

514
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:11.860
<v Speaker 1>You won't implement it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you say to the person,</v>

515
00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:13.210
<v Speaker 1>if you're the psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

516
00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:14.044
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got a couple of ideas about what </v>

517
00:30:15.551 --> 00:30:18.910
<v Speaker 1>you could do this week that might make </v>
<v Speaker 1>this situation slightly better.</v>

518
00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:19.893
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you go and implement them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then come back next week and we'll talk </v>

519
00:30:22.511 --> 00:30:23.344
<v Speaker 1>about whether or not that worked and </v>
<v Speaker 1>work would be you did implement it and </v>

520
00:30:27.341 --> 00:30:30.220
<v Speaker 1>that it did have the desired solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it didn't work,</v>

521
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:33.790
<v Speaker 1>meaning you didn't implement it or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution didn't emerge,</v>

522
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:34.833
<v Speaker 1>then there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the opportunity for </v>

523
00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:40.150
<v Speaker 1>renegotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can think about it strategically.</v>

524
00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:44.470
<v Speaker 1>The first issue is if something needs to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be sorted out,</v>

525
00:30:44.471 --> 00:30:46.990
<v Speaker 1>the first question is what the Hell's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem?</v>

526
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:50.380
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is you probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>

527
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:51.303
<v Speaker 1>The problem is I'm upset and disturbed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and angry and resentful and bitter and </v>

528
00:30:54.251 --> 00:30:57.760
<v Speaker 1>unhappy and anxious and in pain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>lonesome,</v>

529
00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:58.773
<v Speaker 1>I'm suffering from an excess of negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion and perhaps from a certain </v>

530
00:31:01.931 --> 00:31:02.920
<v Speaker 1>amount of hopelessness.</v>

531
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:03.903
<v Speaker 1>So the problem is the emotional </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstance and that might be </v>

532
00:31:06.761 --> 00:31:09.100
<v Speaker 1>associated with some real problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

533
00:31:09.101 --> 00:31:12.850
<v Speaker 1>Some real practical problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you lay all that out and say,</v>

534
00:31:12.851 --> 00:31:13.684
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what is the problem landscape look </v>

535
00:31:15.641 --> 00:31:16.660
<v Speaker 1>like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

536
00:31:16.661 --> 00:31:18.940
<v Speaker 1>So that's the strategic move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

537
00:31:18.941 --> 00:31:21.550
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will generally simplify the problem</v>

538
00:31:21.551 --> 00:31:24.490
<v Speaker 1>landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you do the same thing with a set of</v>

539
00:31:24.491 --> 00:31:26.380
<v Speaker 1>potential solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

540
00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:27.633
<v Speaker 1>what would the solutions look like </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're not gonna be able to </v>

541
00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:33.310
<v Speaker 1>solve a problem unless you at least know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a solution might look like.</v>

542
00:31:33.311 --> 00:31:34.840
<v Speaker 1>That would actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

543
00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:38.770
<v Speaker 1>what would you say that would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you would find acceptable?</v>

544
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:39.783
<v Speaker 1>And then the next issue is to lay out </v>
<v Speaker 1>the strategies for the attainment of </v>

545
00:31:43.001 --> 00:31:44.500
<v Speaker 1>that solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

546
00:31:44.501 --> 00:31:48.250
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these solutions might be dismal.</v>

547
00:31:48.251 --> 00:31:49.084
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

548
00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:53.020
<v Speaker 1>if you've got someone who's ill in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>family to solution might be,</v>

549
00:31:53.021 --> 00:31:55.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we need a cure.</v>

550
00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:57.093
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the only solution that will </v>

551
00:31:58.091 --> 00:31:58.924
<v Speaker 1>suffice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know how to pursue the </v>

552
00:32:01.451 --> 00:32:04.750
<v Speaker 1>cure or maybe one doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you have to think of,</v>

553
00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:05.913
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lower order and less satisfying </v>

554
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:10.600
<v Speaker 1>solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be,</v>

555
00:32:10.601 --> 00:32:11.434
<v Speaker 1>well maybe we can cope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to learn to cope with this </v>

556
00:32:13.991 --> 00:32:16.600
<v Speaker 1>so that it's the least amount of hell </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

557
00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:17.913
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe that maybe that even that's </v>

558
00:32:19.991 --> 00:32:21.550
<v Speaker 1>too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might have to say,</v>

559
00:32:21.551 --> 00:32:22.384
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to try to make this next </v>

560
00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:27.040
<v Speaker 1>week when we're coping with this better </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the last week.</v>

561
00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:28.620
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

562
00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:32.680
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you can't even do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to just be the next day.</v>

563
00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:34.083
<v Speaker 1>You look for whatever small steps </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward you can take that will make </v>

564
00:32:36.701 --> 00:32:39.920
<v Speaker 1>things less wretched and horrible than </v>
<v Speaker 1>they currently are.</v>

565
00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:42.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put it rather bluntly.</v>

566
00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:45.650
<v Speaker 1>And that requires the willingness to </v>
<v Speaker 1>face the problem,</v>

567
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.310
<v Speaker 1>the humility to know that you don't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the solution at hand.</v>

568
00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:50.473
<v Speaker 1>The willingness to listen to how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people that you're talking to </v>

569
00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:57.020
<v Speaker 1>formulate the problems and formulate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>solutions.</v>

570
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:58.430
<v Speaker 1>It's crucially important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

571
00:32:58.431 --> 00:33:01.790
<v Speaker 1>To have them do that work themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also,</v>

572
00:33:01.791 --> 00:33:05.840
<v Speaker 1>you could think about it this way too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you listen to someone come up</v>

573
00:33:05.841 --> 00:33:06.674
<v Speaker 1>with a solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't undergo with the neurological </v>

574
00:33:10.521 --> 00:33:13.850
<v Speaker 1>transformation necessary to change your </v>
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>

575
00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:16.630
<v Speaker 1>but if you come up with the solutions </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

576
00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:20.380
<v Speaker 1>you know if you articulate the problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you articulate the solutions,</v>

577
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:21.463
<v Speaker 1>then you've changed your own character </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way that increases the probability </v>

578
00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:25.843
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to act out what you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that requires real patients to to </v>

579
00:33:29.091 --> 00:33:32.260
<v Speaker 1>let people stumble through to their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

580
00:33:32.261 --> 00:33:35.540
<v Speaker 1>Solutions because someone might lay out </v>
<v Speaker 1>a set of problems and you think,</v>

581
00:33:35.541 --> 00:33:37.610
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you could do about that,</v>

582
00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:40.310
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really matter if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

583
00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:41.923
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm also not saying that sometimes </v>

584
00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:45.830
<v Speaker 1>advice is helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

585
00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.230
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you can give someone a hint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>

586
00:33:48.231 --> 00:33:49.064
<v Speaker 1>you have to be careful with that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a real element of theft that's </v>

587
00:33:51.321 --> 00:33:54.950
<v Speaker 1>associated with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Richard also asked,</v>

588
00:33:54.951 --> 00:33:58.850
<v Speaker 1>how can I talk about the resentments of </v>
<v Speaker 1>my childhood in a way that benefits them</v>

589
00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:00.470
<v Speaker 1>instead of giving them guilt?</v>

590
00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:05.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I can answer that </v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

591
00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Richard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not a question.</v>

592
00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.113
<v Speaker 1>That's what I would ask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you came to talk to me and you had </v>

593
00:34:15.821 --> 00:34:17.800
<v Speaker 1>that question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say first of all,</v>

594
00:34:17.801 --> 00:34:22.540
<v Speaker 1>well what resentments?</v>
<v Speaker 1>List them out,</v>

595
00:34:22.541 --> 00:34:24.250
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Write him down.</v>

596
00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you know what they are.</v>

597
00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Because all of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of those resentments is going to be</v>

598
00:34:29.951 --> 00:34:30.784
<v Speaker 1>a different thing and the strategy </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's associated with each might vary </v>

599
00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:37.750
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of the particularity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the resentment.</v>

600
00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:40.750
<v Speaker 1>So I would say you should start by </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing them down like,</v>

601
00:34:40.751 --> 00:34:41.584
<v Speaker 1>what's your problem exactly here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's all the things that I can think </v>

602
00:34:44.441 --> 00:34:46.900
<v Speaker 1>of that I'm angry about with regard to </v>
<v Speaker 1>my childhood.</v>

603
00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Write that down and then see which ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>are are still living,</v>

604
00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:55.810
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

605
00:34:55.811 --> 00:34:57.520
<v Speaker 1>what do you want from your parents?</v>

606
00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:58.570
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you.</v>

607
00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Do you want them to apologize?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want them to understand what they</v>

608
00:35:02.621 --> 00:35:04.780
<v Speaker 1>did wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to punish them?</v>

609
00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:07.810
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to get?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let them get you.</v>

610
00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:08.973
<v Speaker 1>Let them learn to know you better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to change the way they're </v>

611
00:35:14.111 --> 00:35:14.944
<v Speaker 1>interacting with you now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to learn your own lessons </v>

612
00:35:18.401 --> 00:35:21.160
<v Speaker 1>from your bad experience so that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a parent,</v>

613
00:35:21.161 --> 00:35:21.994
<v Speaker 1>you don't make the same mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You merely want to have a chance to </v>

614
00:35:24.911 --> 00:35:27.730
<v Speaker 1>express yourself like it's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to.</v>

615
00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:31.000
<v Speaker 1>To answer your question because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what your goal is,</v>

616
00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:32.373
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we bought an and I don't need to </v>

617
00:35:33.491 --> 00:35:34.324
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to know what are the </v>

618
00:35:35.561 --> 00:35:36.394
<v Speaker 1>resentments so we can walk the process </v>
<v Speaker 1>we already described laid them out and </v>

619
00:35:39.961 --> 00:35:40.794
<v Speaker 1>comprehensively you might want to make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>list of everything that you think you </v>

620
00:35:44.671 --> 00:35:47.970
<v Speaker 1>might conceivably be annoyed about with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to your parents.</v>

621
00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:50.130
<v Speaker 1>No matter how trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

622
00:35:50.131 --> 00:35:54.440
<v Speaker 1>Because that way you you scour your </v>
<v Speaker 1>memory for,</v>

623
00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:55.500
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

624
00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:59.700
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for things that you're holding onto in a</v>

625
00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:02.940
<v Speaker 1>bitter way and maybe you have your </v>
<v Speaker 1>justification.</v>

626
00:36:02.941 --> 00:36:03.774
<v Speaker 1>I'm not suggesting that you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you need to discover what baggage </v>

627
00:36:07.171 --> 00:36:08.400
<v Speaker 1>you're carrying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to figure out,</v>

628
00:36:08.401 --> 00:36:10.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can I let go of and what's core,</v>

629
00:36:10.741 --> 00:36:11.574
<v Speaker 1>and I would say what's really core is</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there are ways that your parents </v>

630
00:36:16.861 --> 00:36:20.850
<v Speaker 1>treated you that are still affecting you</v>
<v Speaker 1>or that are affecting your relationships</v>

631
00:36:20.851 --> 00:36:21.684
<v Speaker 1>with them now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those really need to be dealt with </v>

632
00:36:23.851 --> 00:36:26.460
<v Speaker 1>because they're not done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not in the past.</v>

633
00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.770
<v Speaker 1>They're not even resentments of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood.</v>

634
00:36:28.771 --> 00:36:31.890
<v Speaker 1>They're still part of your ongoing life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

635
00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:34.883
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now you have all your resentments </v>

636
00:36:35.911 --> 00:36:37.830
<v Speaker 1>laid out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I would say,</v>

637
00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:39.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>

638
00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:40.260
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mom and dad,</v>

639
00:36:40.261 --> 00:36:41.094
<v Speaker 1>there's something I need to talk to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that's been bothering me for a </v>

640
00:36:43.351 --> 00:36:44.184
<v Speaker 1>long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I picked one of the more trivial </v>

641
00:36:45.601 --> 00:36:47.090
<v Speaker 1>things to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

642
00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:47.963
<v Speaker 1>here's a memory I have and don't get all</v>
<v Speaker 1>high and mighty about it because you </v>

643
00:36:51.241 --> 00:36:52.074
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might have misconstrued the </v>

644
00:36:52.831 --> 00:36:53.664
<v Speaker 1>situation as a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's highly probable and they may have </v>

645
00:36:56.011 --> 00:36:59.130
<v Speaker 1>had their reasons and you may not even </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember the situation,</v>

646
00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:01.580
<v Speaker 1>let's say correctly or the way they </v>
<v Speaker 1>remembered saying,</v>

647
00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:02.760
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

648
00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.890
<v Speaker 1>here's something that happened when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a kid in it.</v>

649
00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.860
<v Speaker 1>It still bothers me in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you remember what happened?</v>

650
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:10.500
<v Speaker 1>That's an open ended question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember what happened?</v>

651
00:37:10.501 --> 00:37:12.870
<v Speaker 1>Why did this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where did this go this way?</v>

652
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:15.090
<v Speaker 1>And then I will do an awful lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening,</v>

653
00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:16.253
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you are trying to gather </v>

654
00:37:17.611 --> 00:37:18.444
<v Speaker 1>information and the more your parents </v>
<v Speaker 1>can tell you about what happened in </v>

655
00:37:21.211 --> 00:37:24.360
<v Speaker 1>those situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say the better off you're likely</v>

656
00:37:24.361 --> 00:37:25.194
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>

657
00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:29.130
<v Speaker 1>So that's about all I can say about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

658
00:37:29.131 --> 00:37:29.964
<v Speaker 1>That's fairly delineated approach to </v>
<v Speaker 1>general discussions about difficult </v>

659
00:37:33.451 --> 00:37:34.111
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

660
00:37:34.111 --> 00:37:39.111
<v Speaker 1>But I would say don't be afraid of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be more afraid of engaging in this</v>

661
00:37:39.901 --> 00:37:40.734
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you are afraid of not engaging in </v>

662
00:37:42.961 --> 00:37:43.794
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like every relationship you have is </v>

663
00:37:45.181 --> 00:37:47.580
<v Speaker 1>going to have problems in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

664
00:37:47.581 --> 00:37:48.414
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to jump to a intense </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological discussion with every </v>

665
00:37:52.681 --> 00:37:55.490
<v Speaker 1>little bump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if,</v>

666
00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:56.900
<v Speaker 1>if there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

667
00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:00.330
<v Speaker 1>medium to longterm permanence that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>disturbing you,</v>

668
00:38:00.331 --> 00:38:04.260
<v Speaker 1>or a pattern that repeats itself at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least three times,</v>

669
00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:06.630
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then that might be something that's</v>

670
00:38:06.631 --> 00:38:07.464
<v Speaker 1>worthy of discussion or your discovery </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're very dissatisfied with the </v>

671
00:38:11.071 --> 00:38:11.904
<v Speaker 1>way the relationship is going and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to have the conflict necessary to </v>

672
00:38:15.721 --> 00:38:19.500
<v Speaker 1>sort that out and it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict with you and the client and the</v>

673
00:38:19.501 --> 00:38:20.334
<v Speaker 1>person that you're talking to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the aim should be the establishment </v>

674
00:38:23.071 --> 00:38:23.904
<v Speaker 1>of something like fully informed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fully negotiated medium to longterm </v>

675
00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:31.650
<v Speaker 1>piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're aiming at.</v>

676
00:38:31.651 --> 00:38:32.820
<v Speaker 1>If you have any sense.</v>

677
00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:51.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cody said it took me seven months,</v>

678
00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:54.170
<v Speaker 1>but I completed all the self authoring </v>
<v Speaker 1>suit in July.</v>

679
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:58.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm still not motivated to do anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>and waste all of my time.</v>

680
00:38:58.610 --> 00:39:00.420
<v Speaker 1>What do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well?</v>

681
00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first question is,</v>

682
00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:08.060
<v Speaker 1>is it true that you're not motivated to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do anything?</v>

683
00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:11.030
<v Speaker 1>And is it true that you waste all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your time?</v>

684
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:15.560
<v Speaker 1>It seems highly unlikely to me that both</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those things are 100 percent true.</v>

685
00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:19.870
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things you might notice is</v>
<v Speaker 1>are there anything,</v>

686
00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.170
<v Speaker 1>is there anything that you're motivated </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>

687
00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:24.490
<v Speaker 1>presume you're motivated to eat or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps not,</v>

688
00:39:24.491 --> 00:39:29.491
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not being smart about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Partly what I would say is two things.</v>

689
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.863
<v Speaker 1>He might need some smaller goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to shrink your goals to </v>

690
00:39:37.211 --> 00:39:42.211
<v Speaker 1>the point where you've established a </v>
<v Speaker 1>plan forward that consists of steps that</v>

691
00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:46.450
<v Speaker 1>not only you would be willing to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>but that you would take.</v>

692
00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.940
<v Speaker 1>And so some of that is humility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

693
00:39:48.941 --> 00:39:49.751
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm stuck.</v>

694
00:39:49.751 --> 00:39:52.060
<v Speaker 1>I can barely do anything and it's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm,</v>

695
00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:54.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm laying in bed for seven hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

696
00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:58.900
<v Speaker 1>could I lay in bed for six hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six and a half hours tomorrow,</v>

697
00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:01.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or while I'm in bed,</v>

698
00:40:01.061 --> 00:40:04.480
<v Speaker 1>could I do something somewhat useful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could I read a book?</v>

699
00:40:04.481 --> 00:40:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Can I read one page of a book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I read a paragraph of a book?</v>

700
00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:12.010
<v Speaker 1>You have to find that those steps </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward that you wouldn't take.</v>

701
00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:13.353
<v Speaker 1>I really think it's useful to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends with something like a Google </v>

702
00:40:17.051 --> 00:40:18.670
<v Speaker 1>calendar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

703
00:40:18.671 --> 00:40:19.504
<v Speaker 1>or whatever calendar program you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to use and start designing days </v>

704
00:40:23.471 --> 00:40:24.304
<v Speaker 1>that you would like to have because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the right way to use a calendar </v>

705
00:40:26.681 --> 00:40:28.660
<v Speaker 1>and everyone out there that's listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should.</v>

706
00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:29.913
<v Speaker 1>You should use a calendar to structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>your days because if you know what </v>

707
00:40:33.461 --> 00:40:34.294
<v Speaker 1>you're doing tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it decreases your anxiety substantially </v>

708
00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:38.650
<v Speaker 1>because you need that kind of structure.</v>

709
00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:41.740
<v Speaker 1>You need a pathway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to know,</v>

710
00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:45.520
<v Speaker 1>you need to have a map and you need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know where you're located on the map and</v>

711
00:40:45.521 --> 00:40:46.354
<v Speaker 1>you need to know how you're moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward and that gives you hope because </v>

712
00:40:49.211 --> 00:40:50.044
<v Speaker 1>you're moving towards goals that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>regard as worthwhile and it stops you </v>

713
00:40:54.071 --> 00:40:54.904
<v Speaker 1>from being anxious because you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely directionless and lost and so </v>

714
00:40:58.421 --> 00:40:59.254
<v Speaker 1>learning how to manage your time is </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful and you can start with a </v>

715
00:41:02.201 --> 00:41:03.034
<v Speaker 1>calender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can start with simple things like </v>

716
00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:05.133
<v Speaker 1>you can put in well when you're likely </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go to bed and when you're likely to </v>

717
00:41:08.411 --> 00:41:11.140
<v Speaker 1>get up and and regulating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's useful.</v>

718
00:41:11.141 --> 00:41:14.650
<v Speaker 1>That should be relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>ritualistically consistent.</v>

719
00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:16.143
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to get your life in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order if your sleep wake schedule is </v>

720
00:41:18.671 --> 00:41:19.504
<v Speaker 1>completely a random or if it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>aligned with like day and night and if </v>

721
00:41:26.621 --> 00:41:30.070
<v Speaker 1>it's not aligned with the normative </v>
<v Speaker 1>practices of other people.</v>

722
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:32.830
<v Speaker 1>And so you may have to learn to get your</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep,</v>

723
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:33.703
<v Speaker 1>wake cycle regulated properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the same with your eating </v>

724
00:41:36.321 --> 00:41:37.154
<v Speaker 1>schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are very basic things and you can </v>

725
00:41:39.261 --> 00:41:40.094
<v Speaker 1>do that badly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what you want to approximate </v>

726
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:43.520
<v Speaker 1>three meals a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

727
00:41:43.521 --> 00:41:45.680
<v Speaker 1>because that's what people do </v>
<v Speaker 1>normatively.</v>

728
00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:50.740
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to add small goals.</v>

729
00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that doesn't work,</v>

730
00:41:53.731 --> 00:41:56.930
<v Speaker 1>like if you can't make the goals small </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to achieve,</v>

731
00:41:57.250 --> 00:41:59.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be that you're not being humble</v>

732
00:41:59.211 --> 00:42:02.240
<v Speaker 1>enough with regards to your conceptions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your own ability.</v>

733
00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:03.373
<v Speaker 1>But you can tell if the goal that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>put forward is a reasonable one if </v>

734
00:42:07.551 --> 00:42:09.920
<v Speaker 1>you're actually implementing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're not,</v>

735
00:42:09.921 --> 00:42:12.230
<v Speaker 1>then by definition it's not a reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 1>goal.</v>

736
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:13.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like let's say you're,</v>

737
00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:18.080
<v Speaker 1>you're sleeping all the time in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>room is just a bloody complete disaster,</v>

738
00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:19.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>

739
00:42:19.221 --> 00:42:20.510
<v Speaker 1>well I should clean up my room.</v>

740
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:21.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe you can't,</v>

741
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:24.830
<v Speaker 1>but maybe tomorrow you could hang up two</v>
<v Speaker 1>shirts,</v>

742
00:42:24.831 --> 00:42:27.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you could or you could move to shirts</v>

743
00:42:27.321 --> 00:42:28.154
<v Speaker 1>from your bedroom to the laundry room or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could bag up a bag of dirty clothes </v>

744
00:42:32.031 --> 00:42:36.260
<v Speaker 1>that you could conceivably take to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>laundromat and just do that one thing.</v>

745
00:42:36.261 --> 00:42:38.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do,</v>

746
00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.073
<v Speaker 1>if the rooms that catastrophe and you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one thing and then you did one </v>

747
00:42:42.321 --> 00:42:47.321
<v Speaker 1>thing like that for 15 days or 20 days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe your place would be an order.</v>

748
00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.700
<v Speaker 1>And so the trick is to get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trajectory right.</v>

749
00:42:50.701 --> 00:42:52.130
<v Speaker 1>And Cody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

750
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:53.203
<v Speaker 1>if that doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to need to talk to </v>

751
00:42:54.591 --> 00:42:55.610
<v Speaker 1>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

752
00:42:55.611 --> 00:42:58.430
<v Speaker 1>maybe you need a partner that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

753
00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:02.960
<v Speaker 1>that you can discuss these things with </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you both have a commitment,</v>

754
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.960
<v Speaker 1>like a mutual commitment to attaining a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain set of goals.</v>

755
00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:07.340
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that can be a friend.</v>

756
00:43:07.341 --> 00:43:09.410
<v Speaker 1>It could be somebody that you find </v>
<v Speaker 1>online,</v>

757
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.110
<v Speaker 1>it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it could be a professional,</v>

758
00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:15.560
<v Speaker 1>but if you find that you yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot,</v>

759
00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:16.453
<v Speaker 1>you just can't get this going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to have to reach out </v>

760
00:43:18.561 --> 00:43:22.250
<v Speaker 1>to someone else to give you a hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you need to sit down with a parent</v>

761
00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:23.443
<v Speaker 1>or a friend or somebody that you love </v>
<v Speaker 1>and go over the self authoring suite </v>

762
00:43:29.031 --> 00:43:29.864
<v Speaker 1>with them to go over the future </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoring plans and to discuss how that </v>

763
00:43:32.931 --> 00:43:34.910
<v Speaker 1>might be implemented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

764
00:43:34.911 --> 00:43:39.050
<v Speaker 1>because if you can't do it on your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>then and maybe you shouldn't have to,</v>

765
00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:44.290
<v Speaker 1>then you have to reach out to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and so make your goals smaller.</v>

766
00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:48.980
<v Speaker 1>See if you can make friends with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>schedule or a calendar.</v>

767
00:43:48.981 --> 00:43:49.814
<v Speaker 1>This is really important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of you out there who aren't doing </v>

768
00:43:51.351 --> 00:43:52.184
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I would say all of the people that </v>

769
00:43:54.741 --> 00:43:55.574
<v Speaker 1>I know who have become successful in any</v>
<v Speaker 1>way use a structured means to organize </v>

770
00:44:02.571 --> 00:44:03.404
<v Speaker 1>their time.</v>

771
00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:07.370
<v Speaker 1>They have lists of things to do like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have every day.</v>

772
00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:08.233
<v Speaker 1>There's a list of things to do that day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every week there's a list of things to </v>

773
00:44:11.961 --> 00:44:12.794
<v Speaker 1>do that week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every month there's a list of things to </v>

774
00:44:15.261 --> 00:44:17.270
<v Speaker 1>do that month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

775
00:44:17.271 --> 00:44:18.104
<v Speaker 1>at every level of temporal resolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a sequence of plans and those </v>

776
00:44:22.641 --> 00:44:25.250
<v Speaker 1>plans are implemented on a day to day </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

777
00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:26.293
<v Speaker 1>You cannot be an successful isn't the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right way of thinking about it because </v>

778
00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:32.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm not thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

779
00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:35.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really thinking about rising up </v>
<v Speaker 1>the corporate ladder.</v>

780
00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:38.700
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's sort of what success has come</v>

781
00:44:38.701 --> 00:44:41.460
<v Speaker 1>to mean in our culture that isn't what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>

782
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:47.150
<v Speaker 1>You can have a life that you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>find acceptable without that because you</v>

783
00:44:48.901 --> 00:44:53.901
<v Speaker 1>need the vision and the plans to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>you purpose and direction.</v>

784
00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:56.460
<v Speaker 1>That's where all your positive emotion </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from.</v>

785
00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:57.293
<v Speaker 1>All your motivation is laying out plans </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are worth attaining and then </v>

786
00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:02.723
<v Speaker 1>observing yourself moving towards them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the source of most positive </v>

787
00:45:06.631 --> 00:45:09.870
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then also without that structure,</v>

788
00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:13.320
<v Speaker 1>you're so lost that you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxious and overwhelmed.</v>

789
00:45:13.321 --> 00:45:14.154
<v Speaker 1>It's really like being in a foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>country like isolated and alone with no </v>

790
00:45:18.181 --> 00:45:20.460
<v Speaker 1>map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where the hell I am.</v>

791
00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:24.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the hell I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the rains are going to come,</v>

792
00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:25.113
<v Speaker 1>the storms are going to come and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's winter and I don't know where I am </v>

793
00:45:28.501 --> 00:45:31.080
<v Speaker 1>or where I'm going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the last thing,</v>

794
00:45:31.081 --> 00:45:34.050
<v Speaker 1>cody is like rely on some other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

795
00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you'll be able to return the favor</v>

796
00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:37.393
<v Speaker 1>in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you'll feel bad maybe that you </v>

797
00:45:39.421 --> 00:45:40.254
<v Speaker 1>have to go to someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll feel weak and you know that </v>

798
00:45:42.271 --> 00:45:45.300
<v Speaker 1>you're taking advantage of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people like to be helpful.</v>

799
00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:46.133
<v Speaker 1>They really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And and so it's a mark of trust in </v>

800
00:45:49.951 --> 00:45:54.630
<v Speaker 1>someone and confidence in them that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would ask to have a serious conversation</v>

801
00:45:54.631 --> 00:45:58.740
<v Speaker 1>with them and so and if you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like that,</v>

802
00:45:58.741 --> 00:45:59.574
<v Speaker 1>then you need to find somebody like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe that means you'll have to </v>

803
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:06.210
<v Speaker 1>interact more in online communities or </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have to get the hell out there</v>

804
00:46:06.211 --> 00:46:07.044
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of meetup groups and that </v>

805
00:46:08.911 --> 00:46:12.850
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing online that have organized</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and you can go there and hide</v>

806
00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:15.090
<v Speaker 1>in the back for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Talk to anybody,</v>

807
00:46:15.091 --> 00:46:17.620
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get the hell out there and,</v>

808
00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:18.661
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

809
00:46:18.661 --> 00:46:22.170
<v Speaker 1>make some social connections because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot live alone.</v>

810
00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:23.663
<v Speaker 1>We're social creatures and you need help</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you'll be able to offer some </v>

811
00:46:26.821 --> 00:46:28.410
<v Speaker 1>help at some point in the future too.</v>

812
00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:29.970
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

813
00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:33.000
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rose says,</v>

814
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.863
<v Speaker 1>I'm consumed by envy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can hardly stand to read or watch or </v>

815
00:46:37.531 --> 00:46:40.020
<v Speaker 1>listen to anyone more successful than </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

816
00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:43.800
<v Speaker 1>In what directions am I aiming wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

817
00:46:43.801 --> 00:46:44.521
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look rose,</v>

818
00:46:44.521 --> 00:46:47.460
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty damn useful to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're consumed by envy.</v>

819
00:46:47.461 --> 00:46:49.170
<v Speaker 1>That's a good start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that.</v>

820
00:46:49.171 --> 00:46:52.770
<v Speaker 1>That's a real self realization and an </v>
<v Speaker 1>important one.</v>

821
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:55.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing we might ask is,</v>

822
00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:57.010
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

823
00:46:58.220 --> 00:46:59.053
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's likely reasonable for you to </v>

824
00:47:01.321 --> 00:47:05.820
<v Speaker 1>observe that that's not optimal for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

825
00:47:05.821 --> 00:47:06.654
<v Speaker 1>Because envy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's that resentment that I was </v>

826
00:47:08.431 --> 00:47:11.730
<v Speaker 1>talking about earlier or even worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that jealousy.</v>

827
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not a pleasant </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenological state.</v>

828
00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:19.950
<v Speaker 1>It's not a pleasant state of experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

829
00:47:19.951 --> 00:47:23.190
<v Speaker 1>so look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's look at it this way.</v>

830
00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:25.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you envious of?</v>

831
00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:26.701
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

832
00:47:26.701 --> 00:47:27.534
<v Speaker 1>I can hardly stand to read or watch or </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to anyone more successful than </v>

833
00:47:30.491 --> 00:47:31.324
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

834
00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:32.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty vague,</v>

835
00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:33.553
<v Speaker 1>rose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you want to tighten up your end via </v>

836
00:47:35.831 --> 00:47:36.664
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you'll find that there are </v>

837
00:47:38.561 --> 00:47:39.394
<v Speaker 1>certain people that you're particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>envious of and others whose </v>

838
00:47:42.221 --> 00:47:44.290
<v Speaker 1>accomplishments really don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

839
00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:46.210
<v Speaker 1>disturb you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

840
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:47.823
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing you want to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out which people it is that </v>

841
00:47:51.401 --> 00:47:55.000
<v Speaker 1>you're particularly envious up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you want to figure out,</v>

842
00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:57.370
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it that you think they have?</v>

843
00:47:57.850 --> 00:47:59.020
<v Speaker 1>Now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

844
00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:01.780
<v Speaker 1>they probably have a lot more problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>than you think.</v>

845
00:48:01.781 --> 00:48:02.614
<v Speaker 1>And so part of the pathology of envy is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you look at someone who's </v>

846
00:48:05.711 --> 00:48:06.544
<v Speaker 1>successful and you assume that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>success defines them across all the </v>

847
00:48:09.821 --> 00:48:13.360
<v Speaker 1>important dimensions of their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's rarely the case.</v>

848
00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:14.351
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

849
00:48:14.351 --> 00:48:15.184
<v Speaker 1>there's a naive optimism and envy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's reflected in the fact that you </v>

850
00:48:19.541 --> 00:48:23.770
<v Speaker 1>think that the person you're jealous of </v>
<v Speaker 1>has everything that a person would need.</v>

851
00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:27.340
<v Speaker 1>And that's rarely the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's somewhat besides the point.</v>

852
00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:29.560
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your end,</v>

853
00:48:29.561 --> 00:48:30.394
<v Speaker 1>the lurks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginnings of a structure of </v>

854
00:48:33.221 --> 00:48:34.054
<v Speaker 1>ambition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't be envious of something if </v>

855
00:48:36.491 --> 00:48:39.760
<v Speaker 1>you didn't believe that that was a value</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you should possess.</v>

856
00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the first thing is make a list of all</v>

857
00:48:42.311 --> 00:48:46.810
<v Speaker 1>the people you're in vsl and then figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out what it is about them that you envy.</v>

858
00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:48.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now those are your goals.</v>

859
00:48:48.551 --> 00:48:50.290
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

860
00:48:50.291 --> 00:48:53.650
<v Speaker 1>you might be doubtful that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>attain those goals and I don't know what</v>

861
00:48:53.651 --> 00:48:55.210
<v Speaker 1>the goals would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

862
00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:58.180
<v Speaker 1>like maybe it's beauty for God sake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're envious.</v>

863
00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:59.073
<v Speaker 1>Maybe just for the sake of argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you assume that you're not a very good </v>

864
00:49:01.901 --> 00:49:02.734
<v Speaker 1>looking person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can assume you're not blessed by the </v>

865
00:49:04.721 --> 00:49:08.830
<v Speaker 1>same set of physical attributes that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood star might manifest.</v>

866
00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:11.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you're envious of that.</v>

867
00:49:11.970 --> 00:49:12.611
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

868
00:49:12.611 --> 00:49:15.520
<v Speaker 1>you might start to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well in first of all,</v>

869
00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:20.580
<v Speaker 1>you might think about whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are dimensions of evaluation along</v>

870
00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:21.423
<v Speaker 1>which someone might be judged that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>as important or more important than </v>

871
00:49:26.681 --> 00:49:28.450
<v Speaker 1>physical attractiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

872
00:49:28.451 --> 00:49:29.284
<v Speaker 1>Because there's multiple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's multiple dimensions along which </v>

873
00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:37.360
<v Speaker 1>a person's positive attributes might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>rank ordered and considered,</v>

874
00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:38.283
<v Speaker 1>so you might want to broaden out your </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualization of what constitutes </v>

875
00:49:41.531 --> 00:49:42.364
<v Speaker 1>the good in human action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then like if it is a matter of </v>

876
00:49:46.301 --> 00:49:48.160
<v Speaker 1>attractiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you may have to,</v>

877
00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:49.083
<v Speaker 1>and I'm picking this one because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly difficult one </v>

878
00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:52.270
<v Speaker 1>attractiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

879
00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:53.470
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could you do?</v>

880
00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:57.230
<v Speaker 1>Like how often do you get your haircut </v>
<v Speaker 1>and is it flattering gift,</v>

881
00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:58.083
<v Speaker 1>someone professional doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how to use makeup properly </v>

882
00:50:00.791 --> 00:50:02.490
<v Speaker 1>and carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

883
00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:06.490
<v Speaker 1>are you in reasonable physical condition</v>
<v Speaker 1>or are there,</v>

884
00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:07.473
<v Speaker 1>are there steps that you could take to </v>
<v Speaker 1>put yourself in reasonable physical </v>

885
00:50:10.151 --> 00:50:10.810
<v Speaker 1>condition?</v>

886
00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:14.740
<v Speaker 1>Do you have some nice clothes like it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a matter of decomposition,</v>

887
00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:17.470
<v Speaker 1>so let's assume we'll be optimistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>

888
00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:19.060
<v Speaker 1>You're envious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

889
00:50:19.061 --> 00:50:20.920
<v Speaker 1>well that means there's some things you </v>
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>

890
00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:21.993
<v Speaker 1>You don't have them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the beginnings of a </v>

891
00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:24.783
<v Speaker 1>philosophical stance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you lay out what it is you're about </v>

892
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:28.641
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

893
00:50:28.641 --> 00:50:31.310
<v Speaker 1>these persons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people have this and this and this</v>

894
00:50:31.311 --> 00:50:32.144
<v Speaker 1>and this and I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's unfair and it might be </v>

895
00:50:35.121 --> 00:50:35.954
<v Speaker 1>unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably not an unfairness that </v>

896
00:50:38.401 --> 00:50:39.234
<v Speaker 1>specifically aimed at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably more a general reflection </v>

897
00:50:43.911 --> 00:50:48.410
<v Speaker 1>of the unfairness and inequality that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of life and that's worth knowing,</v>

898
00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:49.483
<v Speaker 1>but in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lay out your envy and you and you </v>

899
00:50:52.041 --> 00:50:54.800
<v Speaker 1>delve deep into it and you find out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

900
00:50:54.801 --> 00:50:57.320
<v Speaker 1>here's what I want because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>envious,</v>

901
00:50:57.410 --> 00:51:00.260
<v Speaker 1>envious because you see other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have what you want.</v>

902
00:51:00.261 --> 00:51:01.094
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

903
00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:04.430
<v Speaker 1>Now all of a sudden you know what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want or that's useful,</v>

904
00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:05.293
<v Speaker 1>terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you might see that it's so </v>

905
00:51:06.591 --> 00:51:07.424
<v Speaker 1>distant from you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can at least lay out and then </v>

906
00:51:10.191 --> 00:51:12.710
<v Speaker 1>maybe even admit to yourself what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

907
00:51:12.711 --> 00:51:13.544
<v Speaker 1>Because the other thing is is that you'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>be unlikely to be so envious if you </v>

908
00:51:18.081 --> 00:51:23.081
<v Speaker 1>weren't hiding from yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it is that you that you truly want.</v>

909
00:51:23.691 --> 00:51:25.940
<v Speaker 1>You might be terrified to admit it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

910
00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:27.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you admit it,</v>

911
00:51:27.081 --> 00:51:29.360
<v Speaker 1>then you know what you want and you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're failing,</v>

912
00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:30.973
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and and by hiding what you want from </v>

913
00:51:32.331 --> 00:51:33.164
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you can hide to some degree </v>

914
00:51:35.330 --> 00:51:36.163
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you're not getting it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're failing and it's no wonder </v>

915
00:51:39.651 --> 00:51:40.484
<v Speaker 1>that people do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So make a list of what you're envious </v>

916
00:51:42.370 --> 00:51:43.203
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Extract from that the virtues that you </v>

917
00:51:45.651 --> 00:51:47.000
<v Speaker 1>would like to pursue.</v>

918
00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:50.210
<v Speaker 1>Understand clearly then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you pursue those virtues,</v>

919
00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:51.253
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get what you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the envy will consume you more and </v>

920
00:51:54.201 --> 00:51:57.380
<v Speaker 1>that's like a good pathway to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a good thing.</v>

921
00:51:57.830 --> 00:51:58.663
<v Speaker 1>And so make a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's some things that other people </v>

922
00:52:01.401 --> 00:52:02.234
<v Speaker 1>have that I want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can I start to move towards having </v>

923
00:52:05.361 --> 00:52:08.060
<v Speaker 1>some of that myself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a,</v>

924
00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:11.550
<v Speaker 1>that's the right way to deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because the other,</v>

925
00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:12.403
<v Speaker 1>what's the alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to tear these people down </v>

926
00:52:13.791 --> 00:52:15.060
<v Speaker 1>or or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

927
00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:16.193
<v Speaker 1>or manifest hatred for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for them and maybe take your revenge </v>

928
00:52:19.191 --> 00:52:22.490
<v Speaker 1>when you can on the people around you </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're so angry and you're going</v>

929
00:52:22.491 --> 00:52:25.100
<v Speaker 1>to tear yourself into pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

930
00:52:25.101 --> 00:52:28.110
<v Speaker 1>consumed by envy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

931
00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:28.651
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

932
00:52:28.651 --> 00:52:30.860
<v Speaker 1>that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a Predator metaphor.</v>

933
00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:34.580
<v Speaker 1>Envy is something that's eating you up </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's not good,</v>

934
00:52:34.581 --> 00:52:35.414
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really good that you've at </v>

935
00:52:36.981 --> 00:52:37.814
<v Speaker 1>least admitted it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that start part of that confrontation </v>

936
00:52:40.401 --> 00:52:41.234
<v Speaker 1>with his shadow.</v>

937
00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:43.610
<v Speaker 1>So you can see your dark side there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

938
00:52:43.611 --> 00:52:46.610
<v Speaker 1>when you could look at your fantasies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you're consumed by envy,</v>

939
00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:49.280
<v Speaker 1>no doubt you have some pretty damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>brutal fantasies.</v>

940
00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:51.530
<v Speaker 1>I wish this is what happened to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

941
00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:52.723
<v Speaker 1>No God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think they're so smart and it's </v>

942
00:52:53.991 --> 00:52:54.824
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope they fall and I get a chance to </v>

943
00:52:56.151 --> 00:52:57.410
<v Speaker 1>kick them well on debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

944
00:52:57.411 --> 00:52:58.244
<v Speaker 1>they're down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you can join a twitter mob and </v>

945
00:52:59.661 --> 00:53:02.210
<v Speaker 1>take them out if they make a mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

946
00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:03.673
<v Speaker 1>but that can also get you in touch with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dark side of you that maybe has the </v>

947
00:53:06.951 --> 00:53:07.784
<v Speaker 1>ability to to put forward some </v>
<v Speaker 1>commitment to moving forward in the </v>

948
00:53:11.301 --> 00:53:13.640
<v Speaker 1>future that can make you tough and </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong,</v>

949
00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:18.440
<v Speaker 1>and so you might also start with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consideration that you could move in the</v>

950
00:53:18.441 --> 00:53:20.810
<v Speaker 1>direction that you desire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

951
00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:23.390
<v Speaker 1>If you were willing to make the proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices,</v>

952
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.823
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to do the work and maybe if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could find out what would truly </v>

953
00:53:27.331 --> 00:53:30.720
<v Speaker 1>motivate you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which might be the desire to cease being</v>

954
00:53:30.721 --> 00:53:33.510
<v Speaker 1>consumed by envy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be a good start.</v>

955
00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:38.490
<v Speaker 1>And then to pursue these goals that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>implicit in your jealousy,</v>

956
00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:40.530
<v Speaker 1>well then you have a direction for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

957
00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:44.550
<v Speaker 1>So in what directions are you aiming </v>
<v Speaker 1>raw?</v>

958
00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:45.533
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're assuming that you're being </v>

959
00:53:48.571 --> 00:53:49.404
<v Speaker 1>unfairly treated and that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that there's something personal </v>

960
00:53:52.051 --> 00:53:52.884
<v Speaker 1>about that now you probably are being </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfairly treated in some sense because </v>

961
00:53:56.251 --> 00:53:57.084
<v Speaker 1>that's just the human condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say like there's a real </v>

962
00:53:59.521 --> 00:54:00.354
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary element of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're subject to the depredations of </v>

963
00:54:02.971 --> 00:54:07.971
<v Speaker 1>nature and the tyranny of culture and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own appalling shortcomings,</v>

964
00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:11.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's life.</v>

965
00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:13.950
<v Speaker 1>It's not personal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>

966
00:54:13.951 --> 00:54:14.784
<v Speaker 1>and that's worth knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the standard human </v>

967
00:54:16.381 --> 00:54:17.214
<v Speaker 1>condition and you should aim at </v>
<v Speaker 1>rectifying your envy and some of that's </v>

968
00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:22.013
<v Speaker 1>going to be dropping that bitter </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment and the other is going to be </v>

969
00:54:24.121 --> 00:54:24.954
<v Speaker 1>pursuing what you need to pursue to </v>
<v Speaker 1>allow you to view your life as at least </v>

970
00:54:29.581 --> 00:54:30.870
<v Speaker 1>acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

971
00:54:31.110 --> 00:54:34.320
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's hope in the NV once you admit</v>

972
00:54:34.321 --> 00:54:36.300
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it gives you moral direction.</v>

973
00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:40.310
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Peterson,</v>

974
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:41.503
<v Speaker 1>what would you advise to a person who </v>
<v Speaker 1>has the courage to defy the crowd but </v>

975
00:54:44.991 --> 00:54:48.500
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have the verbal skills to debate</v>
<v Speaker 1>real time?</v>

976
00:54:58.940 --> 00:54:59.773
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

977
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:02.510
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of ways of defining the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crowd.</v>

978
00:55:02.511 --> 00:55:03.344
<v Speaker 1>Let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could live your life the way </v>

979
00:55:05.571 --> 00:55:09.560
<v Speaker 1>that you want live id that's matter of </v>
<v Speaker 1>action and know,</v>

980
00:55:09.561 --> 00:55:12.020
<v Speaker 1>and they say actions speak louder than </v>
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>

981
00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:17.380
<v Speaker 1>and one of the best things you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly be is a inspirational example.</v>

982
00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:19.093
<v Speaker 1>So that's not nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that something live properly in </v>

983
00:55:25.071 --> 00:55:27.080
<v Speaker 1>your defiance of the crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

984
00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:29.913
<v Speaker 1>Make your own course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allow yourself to be guided by your own </v>

985
00:55:33.791 --> 00:55:34.624
<v Speaker 1>genuine principles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't necessarily have to advertise </v>

986
00:55:37.301 --> 00:55:40.210
<v Speaker 1>that which is in some sense what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing when you,</v>

987
00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:41.133
<v Speaker 1>when you're debating because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking the manner in which you act like </v>

988
00:55:44.741 --> 00:55:47.740
<v Speaker 1>if you're an integrated person and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're articulating that,</v>

989
00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:51.820
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you can't do that because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have the verbal skills.</v>

990
00:55:51.821 --> 00:55:52.654
<v Speaker 1>Well then the question would be maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>you should develop some more verbal </v>

991
00:55:55.001 --> 00:55:56.650
<v Speaker 1>skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

992
00:55:56.651 --> 00:55:58.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know this for sure date if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

993
00:55:58.571 --> 00:56:00.880
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but generally it's useful.</v>

994
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.570
<v Speaker 1>How do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't hurt to read.</v>

995
00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:08.860
<v Speaker 1>Really doesn't hurt to write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

996
00:56:08.861 --> 00:56:11.500
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of writing everyday </v>
<v Speaker 1>clarifies your thinking.</v>

997
00:56:11.501 --> 00:56:14.800
<v Speaker 1>It's a hard thing to do and it's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unlikely thing.</v>

998
00:56:14.801 --> 00:56:16.600
<v Speaker 1>Most people won't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>

999
00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:17.823
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't be asking me this question </v>

1000
00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:20.433
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't think at some level that </v>
<v Speaker 1>some improvement in your verbal ability </v>

1001
00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:27.490
<v Speaker 1>would be useful to you.</v>

1002
00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you do that?</v>

1003
00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:32.860
<v Speaker 1>You read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you're right.</v>

1004
00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:33.783
<v Speaker 1>The reason you write is because writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces you to articulate your thoughts </v>

1005
00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:40.630
<v Speaker 1>and organize your brain around whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that you're writing about.</v>

1006
00:56:40.631 --> 00:56:44.950
<v Speaker 1>And then one of the easiest ways to </v>
<v Speaker 1>write there isn't any real easy way,</v>

1007
00:56:44.951 --> 00:56:47.860
<v Speaker 1>but when the easiest ways to write is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>write down a problem,</v>

1008
00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:48.641
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1009
00:56:48.641 --> 00:56:49.240
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1010
00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:52.960
<v Speaker 1>what problem is bothering me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you can write about that.</v>

1011
00:56:53.050 --> 00:56:56.260
<v Speaker 1>First of all to get the problem clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's a hard thing.</v>

1012
00:56:56.410 --> 00:56:57.243
<v Speaker 1>Then you start to write about what my </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible solutions be and if you fight </v>

1013
00:57:01.091 --> 00:57:05.170
<v Speaker 1>with those solutions because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to kill off the stupid ones and</v>

1014
00:57:05.171 --> 00:57:06.310
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1015
00:57:06.311 --> 00:57:10.270
<v Speaker 1>maybe you need to learn to speak more </v>
<v Speaker 1>fluently.</v>

1016
00:57:10.690 --> 00:57:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1017
00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:14.020
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1018
00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:15.430
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what might we say?</v>

1019
00:57:15.550 --> 00:57:20.550
<v Speaker 1>You could try a class in improvisation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe that's too daunting.</v>

1020
00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:28.560
<v Speaker 1>You could join a speaker's club like </v>
<v Speaker 1>toastmasters.</v>

1021
00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:30.043
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could try talking more at dinner </v>

1022
00:57:32.291 --> 00:57:34.780
<v Speaker 1>parties a little bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you formulate your thoughts,</v>

1023
00:57:34.781 --> 00:57:39.010
<v Speaker 1>you have to be willing to be somewhat of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bumbling fool to begin with,</v>

1024
00:57:39.011 --> 00:57:39.844
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're gonna not if and maybe </v>

1025
00:57:42.461 --> 00:57:43.294
<v Speaker 1>you're better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your verbal skills are better than you </v>

1026
00:57:44.441 --> 00:57:45.630
<v Speaker 1>think they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1027
00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:46.563
<v Speaker 1>and you're just self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to practice putting </v>

1028
00:57:49.181 --> 00:57:51.870
<v Speaker 1>yourself forward a little bit and tended</v>
<v Speaker 1>to flee.</v>

1029
00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:54.100
<v Speaker 1>You can do a lot of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1030
00:57:54.101 --> 00:57:58.390
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that initial learning how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with people though,</v>

1031
00:57:58.570 --> 00:57:59.403
<v Speaker 1>by asking them questions about what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>think and then responding instead of </v>

1032
00:58:03.401 --> 00:58:06.100
<v Speaker 1>being too concerned about putting your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own point forward.</v>

1033
00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:07.540
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1034
00:58:07.541 --> 00:58:08.374
<v Speaker 1>so what's the answer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would I advise to the person who </v>

1035
00:58:10.781 --> 00:58:12.910
<v Speaker 1>has the courage to defy the crowd?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

1036
00:58:12.970 --> 00:58:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Live according to your principles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1037
00:58:15.790 --> 00:58:16.623
<v Speaker 1>And that's not a verbal thing and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be a good example and now it's a </v>

1038
00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:20.973
<v Speaker 1>major accomplishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then if you need to improve your </v>

1039
00:58:24.731 --> 00:58:26.830
<v Speaker 1>verbal ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is generally a good thing,</v>

1040
00:58:26.831 --> 00:58:28.930
<v Speaker 1>then those are the ways to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Read,</v>

1041
00:58:29.890 --> 00:58:32.410
<v Speaker 1>write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speak,</v>

1042
00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:35.370
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1043
00:58:35.650 --> 00:58:36.483
<v Speaker 1>and understand that developing those </v>
<v Speaker 1>abilities might be of tremendous use to </v>

1044
00:58:39.761 --> 00:58:40.510
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1045
00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:43.180
<v Speaker 1>because it's one thing to live properly </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not a trivial thing,</v>

1046
00:58:43.181 --> 00:58:44.014
<v Speaker 1>but it's another thing to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate yourself and to be able to </v>

1047
00:58:46.931 --> 00:58:47.764
<v Speaker 1>negotiate and generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing about that that isn't </v>

1048
00:58:51.161 --> 00:58:56.161
<v Speaker 1>advantageous and even introverted and </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxious people can learn to do that.</v>

1049
00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:57.033
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

1050
00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:59.380
<v Speaker 1>Those are learnable skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy but,</v>

1051
00:58:59.470 --> 00:59:01.690
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can manage it.</v>

1052
00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:05.830
<v Speaker 1>You can also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can also speak carefully.</v>

1053
00:59:05.831 --> 00:59:06.664
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and listen to what you're saying and </v>

1054
00:59:07.661 --> 00:59:10.030
<v Speaker 1>only try to say things that you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>are true.</v>

1055
00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:13.390
<v Speaker 1>That's also unbelievably useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to feel that out.</v>

1056
00:59:13.391 --> 00:59:14.224
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this really what I believe or am I </v>

1057
00:59:16.271 --> 00:59:20.680
<v Speaker 1>putting it forward because I want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look good or I want to dominate or,</v>

1058
00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:22.853
<v Speaker 1>or I wanted to express bleakly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion that I'm too cowardly to come </v>

1059
00:59:27.261 --> 00:59:30.140
<v Speaker 1>out and confront directly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or Am I being manipulative?</v>

1060
00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:33.050
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of reasons that people use </v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

1061
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:38.230
<v Speaker 1>but what you really should use it for is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to state what you believe to be true and</v>

1062
00:59:38.991 --> 00:59:43.991
<v Speaker 1>then to let the consequences of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfold and so that can also help you.</v>

1063
00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:50.120
<v Speaker 1>Simple truths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bluntly stated,</v>

1064
00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:51.253
<v Speaker 1>can be very powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need a lot of verbal fluency </v>

1065
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:57.800
<v Speaker 1>under those circumstances if there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence of strength of character behind</v>

1066
00:59:57.801 --> 00:59:59.240
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1067
01:00:01.610 --> 01:00:06.590
<v Speaker 1>the Dao de Jing speaks of acting </v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally well,</v>

1068
01:00:06.591 --> 01:00:11.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's acting naturally.</v>

1069
01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:12.193
<v Speaker 1>It depends on what you mean by naturally</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Tao Te Ching speaks of acting in a </v>

1070
01:00:17.391 --> 01:00:21.770
<v Speaker 1>manner that balances Yin and Yang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the balances chaos and order,</v>

1071
01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.233
<v Speaker 1>and that means that you're speaking in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right place at the right time about </v>

1072
01:00:28.491 --> 01:00:29.324
<v Speaker 1>the right things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's allied with part of what I </v>

1073
01:00:33.651 --> 01:00:36.320
<v Speaker 1>just discussed with regards to speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth.</v>

1074
01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:38.863
<v Speaker 1>How is one to put their foot down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>change slash better their condition </v>

1075
01:00:41.931 --> 01:00:44.540
<v Speaker 1>without an unnaturally manipulating </v>
<v Speaker 1>their world?</v>

1076
01:00:45.050 --> 01:00:45.883
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental answer to that is to </v>

1077
01:00:51.591 --> 01:00:54.710
<v Speaker 1>speak the truth and to let</v>

1078
01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:59.380
<v Speaker 1>the consequences of that unfold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the trick is,</v>

1079
01:00:59.381 --> 01:01:00.214
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it that you come to speak the </v>

1080
01:01:01.631 --> 01:01:03.100
<v Speaker 1>truth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1081
01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.950
<v Speaker 1>in order to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell,</v>

1082
01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:10.090
<v Speaker 1>you have to be terrified of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of not speaking the truth.</v>

1083
01:01:10.091 --> 01:01:13.000
<v Speaker 1>And and part of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1084
01:01:13.001 --> 01:01:13.834
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want the truth on your side or </v>

1085
01:01:14.921 --> 01:01:15.940
<v Speaker 1>not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to?</v>

1086
01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to be facing the truth as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>enemy?</v>

1087
01:01:20.801 --> 01:01:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Or do you want to have the truth behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>you as an ally?</v>

1088
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:30.460
<v Speaker 1>And the truth is reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't see that you want reality as</v>

1089
01:01:30.461 --> 01:01:31.294
<v Speaker 1>an enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if what you do is use your </v>

1090
01:01:33.191 --> 01:01:37.900
<v Speaker 1>language to represent reality as </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurately as you possibly can.</v>

1091
01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:40.930
<v Speaker 1>Now given all your inadequacies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>biases,</v>

1092
01:01:40.990 --> 01:01:43.690
<v Speaker 1>you're bound to make errors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's the goal.</v>

1093
01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:47.230
<v Speaker 1>Then you have the force of reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind you.</v>

1094
01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:48.513
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's as if you've you know where you </v>

1095
01:01:50.321 --> 01:01:53.290
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might not like it and you may be,</v>

1096
01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:54.273
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a terrible craggy chasm full </v>

1097
01:01:57.221 --> 01:01:58.054
<v Speaker 1>of lava and water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least you can see where the </v>

1098
01:02:00.131 --> 01:02:02.440
<v Speaker 1>obstacles are and you can pick your way </v>
<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>

1099
01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:08.080
<v Speaker 1>So and then the naturalness is well</v>

1100
01:02:14.850 --> 01:02:17.010
<v Speaker 1>from the Dallas perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some sense you're,</v>

1101
01:02:17.730 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're aiming at being at peace with the</v>

1102
01:02:20.041 --> 01:02:20.874
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means accepting it in some </v>

1103
01:02:24.541 --> 01:02:25.374
<v Speaker 1>sense for what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can't speak the truth unless </v>

1104
01:02:29.341 --> 01:02:33.240
<v Speaker 1>you're willing to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means to a large degree,</v>

1105
01:02:33.241 --> 01:02:36.150
<v Speaker 1>it means all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means exploring the depths of Yin and</v>

1106
01:02:36.151 --> 01:02:36.984
<v Speaker 1>Yang of order and chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the order to know that like there are </v>

1107
01:02:40.291 --> 01:02:41.124
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical forces afoot and some of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>are operated in you and some of them </v>

1108
01:02:46.261 --> 01:02:50.910
<v Speaker 1>operate in the social world and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of them operate for that matter</v>

1109
01:02:50.911 --> 01:02:54.210
<v Speaker 1>in the natural world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much crushing order.</v>

1110
01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:56.453
<v Speaker 1>And on the chaotic side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the possibility of nihilism and </v>

1111
01:02:58.531 --> 01:03:01.620
<v Speaker 1>hopelessness and depression and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete cataclysm.</v>

1112
01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:03.940
<v Speaker 1>And so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1113
01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:04.890
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1114
01:03:04.890 --> 01:03:09.270
<v Speaker 1>there's cliffs on both sides of you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be aware of that because you</v>

1115
01:03:09.271 --> 01:03:13.110
<v Speaker 1>don't want to fall into those cliffs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a thin pathway between them that</v>

1116
01:03:13.111 --> 01:03:16.440
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can walk down if you're careful</v>

1117
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:21.950
<v Speaker 1>and you feel your way down that pathway </v>
<v Speaker 1>by noting how,</v>

1118
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:23.303
<v Speaker 1>what you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>noting whether what you say puts a </v>

1119
01:03:28.191 --> 01:03:31.830
<v Speaker 1>foundation underneath you that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a New Testament,</v>

1120
01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:33.053
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>injunction to that goal to build your </v>

1121
01:03:34.831 --> 01:03:36.750
<v Speaker 1>house on a rock not on sand.</v>

1122
01:03:37.310 --> 01:03:38.143
<v Speaker 1>And what's the rock or the rock is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth and integrity of your character </v>

1123
01:03:41.911 --> 01:03:46.710
<v Speaker 1>and have your voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is and why you see</v>

1124
01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:53.490
<v Speaker 1>you want to aim at something noble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the alliance with God.</v>

1125
01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:54.353
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to serve the highest good and </v>

1126
01:03:57.541 --> 01:03:59.550
<v Speaker 1>you have to think very hard about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is.</v>

1127
01:03:59.610 --> 01:04:00.443
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know what it is to some degree or we </v>

1128
01:04:01.681 --> 01:04:02.514
<v Speaker 1>have some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have some collective conception of </v>

1129
01:04:04.741 --> 01:04:05.970
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1130
01:04:06.330 --> 01:04:08.910
<v Speaker 1>it would be piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be something.</v>

1131
01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:10.223
<v Speaker 1>It would be the willingness and desire </v>
<v Speaker 1>to treat other people like you would </v>

1132
01:04:14.461 --> 01:04:17.700
<v Speaker 1>like to be treated if you were treating </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself properly.</v>

1133
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.000
<v Speaker 1>It's that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's it's characterological nobility.</v>

1134
01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:24.233
<v Speaker 1>It's the desire to serve the good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's truth and beauty and all of those </v>

1135
01:04:27.541 --> 01:04:31.080
<v Speaker 1>classic virtues all integrated into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>single thing.</v>

1136
01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:32.393
<v Speaker 1>You want to serve that and then you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then having aimed at that you won't do </v>

1137
01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:38.790
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1138
01:04:38.791 --> 01:04:40.650
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that governs how you're going to see the</v>

1139
01:04:40.651 --> 01:04:41.341
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1140
01:04:41.341 --> 01:04:43.990
<v Speaker 1>That sets the sets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1141
01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:51.920
<v Speaker 1>that sets the lens or it sets the frame </v>
<v Speaker 1>through which the world manifests itself</v>

1142
01:04:53.071 --> 01:04:54.840
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1143
01:04:54.841 --> 01:04:55.674
<v Speaker 1>So it's as if you're getting your </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectacles adjusted properly and then </v>

1144
01:04:59.131 --> 01:04:59.964
<v Speaker 1>the world reveals itself to you and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you use your language to articulate </v>

1145
01:05:04.741 --> 01:05:07.470
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

1146
01:05:09.330 --> 01:05:11.570
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1147
01:05:13.230 --> 01:05:15.810
<v Speaker 1>that's naturally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

1148
01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:16.980
<v Speaker 1>it's not natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very.</v>

1149
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.380
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't do that,</v>

1150
01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:22.083
<v Speaker 1>what you do is end up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You end up using your language to </v>

1151
01:05:23.951 --> 01:05:26.380
<v Speaker 1>manipulate people into giving you what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want.</v>

1152
01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:29.980
<v Speaker 1>And that's not helpful because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1153
01:05:30.490 --> 01:05:34.060
<v Speaker 1>what do you know about what you want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give me one second.</v>

1154
01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Give me one second.</v>

1155
01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:56.893
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1156
01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:05.110
<v Speaker 1>sorry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My son,</v>

1157
01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:06.273
<v Speaker 1>my son's basement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My house is being renovated in Toronto </v>

1158
01:06:08.621 --> 01:06:09.454
<v Speaker 1>for well til this afternoon and he's got</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new puppy and he was rolling a bone </v>

1159
01:06:14.651 --> 01:06:18.220
<v Speaker 1>upstairs on the floor for this puppy is </v>
<v Speaker 1>very cute by the way.</v>

1160
01:06:18.221 --> 01:06:20.650
<v Speaker 1>This puppy that's making quite a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>racket.</v>

1161
01:06:20.651 --> 01:06:24.320
<v Speaker 1>So I just had to take care of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1162
01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:28.440
<v Speaker 1>so just give him a good cuff and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1163
01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:29.283
<v Speaker 1>I just asked him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just told him that the ball was </v>

1164
01:06:31.241 --> 01:06:32.920
<v Speaker 1>rolling around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

1165
01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:37.310
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of this is faith and truth.</v>

1166
01:06:37.311 --> 01:06:39.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really it's hard to.</v>

1167
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:44.450
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to emphasize this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Importantly enough.</v>

1168
01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:47.120
<v Speaker 1>You have to make a decision in your life</v>
<v Speaker 1>at some point.</v>

1169
01:06:47.121 --> 01:06:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Look about how you're going to use your </v>
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>

1170
01:06:51.050 --> 01:06:54.100
<v Speaker 1>You can use them instrumentally and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can use them to manipulate people.</v>

1171
01:06:54.101 --> 01:06:54.501
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1172
01:06:54.501 --> 01:06:55.334
<v Speaker 1>this is what I want from this situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's how I'm going to have to </v>

1173
01:06:58.581 --> 01:07:02.510
<v Speaker 1>craft my words to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you can think,</v>

1174
01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:04.223
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm oriented properly in the world and </v>

1175
01:07:06.261 --> 01:07:10.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to save what I think and let </v>
<v Speaker 1>things happen,</v>

1176
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:12.103
<v Speaker 1>and those are two different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really two different modes of </v>

1177
01:07:14.091 --> 01:07:16.280
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote about this in 12 rules for life.</v>

1178
01:07:16.850 --> 01:07:19.210
<v Speaker 1>They're really two different modes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being and the latter,</v>

1179
01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:20.083
<v Speaker 1>the latter one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is faith and truth as the same as </v>

1180
01:07:22.821 --> 01:07:25.790
<v Speaker 1>faith in the logo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spite away from a symbolic perspective.</v>

1181
01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:27.073
<v Speaker 1>It's the faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That truth is that which turns </v>

1182
01:07:29.751 --> 01:07:33.080
<v Speaker 1>uninhabitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chaos into habitable order.</v>

1183
01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:36.340
<v Speaker 1>It's the truth that does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you,</v>

1184
01:07:36.490 --> 01:07:39.140
<v Speaker 1>you tell the truth and you throw caution</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the wind.</v>

1185
01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:40.133
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean you tell the truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupidly because telling the truth </v>

1186
01:07:42.291 --> 01:07:43.124
<v Speaker 1>stupidly isn't truthful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to do it very carefully and </v>

1187
01:07:46.161 --> 01:07:48.020
<v Speaker 1>very strategically,</v>

1188
01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:52.680
<v Speaker 1>strategically,</v>

1189
01:07:54.730 --> 01:07:56.400
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the strategic part,</v>

1190
01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:57.293
<v Speaker 1>the goal is to get better all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>at carefully articulating what </v>

1191
01:08:01.171 --> 01:08:04.290
<v Speaker 1>constitutes the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1192
01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:06.173
<v Speaker 1>it seems obvious to me in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you got to really think this </v>

1193
01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:09.151
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1194
01:08:09.151 --> 01:08:12.930
<v Speaker 1>what do you want on your side?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want false hood on your side.</v>

1195
01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:15.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who thinks that you really,</v>

1196
01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:16.243
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to be able to lie and </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulate your way through the world </v>

1197
01:08:18.681 --> 01:08:19.970
<v Speaker 1>and that you're going to get away with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1198
01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:25.010
<v Speaker 1>but there's an arrogance that goes along</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that arrogance in belief,</v>

1199
01:08:25.490 --> 01:08:26.323
<v Speaker 1>that arrogance of belief in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>capability to deceive and that you're </v>

1200
01:08:30.231 --> 01:08:32.210
<v Speaker 1>going to pull the wool over everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes,</v>

1201
01:08:32.211 --> 01:08:33.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to deceive yourself because</v>

1202
01:08:33.741 --> 01:08:37.130
<v Speaker 1>you're going to believe in your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>maliciousness and mendacious snus.</v>

1203
01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:38.113
<v Speaker 1>You're going to deceive other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're stupid and they won't </v>

1204
01:08:39.951 --> 01:08:40.784
<v Speaker 1>catch on and you're going to see you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to deceive God and reality itself </v>

1205
01:08:45.350 --> 01:08:49.210
<v Speaker 1>because it's not going to snap back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>take you out if you bend and distort it,</v>

1206
01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:52.910
<v Speaker 1>like that's so foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a hope,</v>

1207
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:53.833
<v Speaker 1>none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might get away with your lies for a </v>

1208
01:08:56.361 --> 01:08:57.194
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're going to aggregate and take </v>

1209
01:09:00.231 --> 01:09:03.050
<v Speaker 1>you out and at every level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not least,</v>

1210
01:09:03.051 --> 01:09:05.060
<v Speaker 1>your own guilt in your own self </v>
<v Speaker 1>contempt.</v>

1211
01:09:05.570 --> 01:09:06.403
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1212
01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:19.990
<v Speaker 1>so where was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1213
01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:32.030
<v Speaker 1>that's good answer to that question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1214
01:09:35.701 --> 01:09:39.330
<v Speaker 1>We don't live in into radical patriarch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you provide a better explanation for</v>

1215
01:09:39.331 --> 01:09:40.164
<v Speaker 1>the iniquities women face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially lateness of the right to </v>

1216
01:09:42.481 --> 01:09:43.410
<v Speaker 1>vote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

1217
01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:45.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1218
01:09:45.210 --> 01:09:47.700
<v Speaker 1>130 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1219
01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:49.410
<v Speaker 1>let's take $8,</v>
<v Speaker 1>95,</v>

1220
01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:54.270
<v Speaker 1>just as a starting point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world wasn't the same place as it is</v>

1221
01:09:54.271 --> 01:09:56.370
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1222
01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:01.563
<v Speaker 1>rights and privileges spread as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>social and economic conditions make </v>

1223
01:10:06.130 --> 01:10:11.130
<v Speaker 1>their manifestation possible to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree to some degree.</v>

1224
01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:13.873
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not suggesting that men have </v>

1225
01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:20.800
<v Speaker 1>oppressed women and the women have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressed man Christ,</v>

1226
01:10:20.801 --> 01:10:21.634
<v Speaker 1>we've been at each other's throats in </v>
<v Speaker 1>many ways throughout the entire course </v>

1227
01:10:24.881 --> 01:10:27.210
<v Speaker 1>of human history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men that the throats of men,</v>

1228
01:10:27.610 --> 01:10:30.760
<v Speaker 1>men at the throats of women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women at the throats of men,</v>

1229
01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:35.230
<v Speaker 1>women at the throats of women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents at the throats of children,</v>

1230
01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:36.353
<v Speaker 1>like there's no shortage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>contentiousness and tyranny that </v>

1231
01:10:39.341 --> 01:10:42.760
<v Speaker 1>characterizes human history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1232
01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:46.200
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 18,</v>

1233
01:10:46.210 --> 01:10:47.043
<v Speaker 1>95,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average person in the western world </v>

1234
01:10:48.881 --> 01:10:49.714
<v Speaker 1>lived on less than a dollar a day in </v>
<v Speaker 1>today's money way below the current UN </v>

1235
01:10:54.161 --> 01:10:56.890
<v Speaker 1>standards for poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life was very,</v>

1236
01:10:56.891 --> 01:11:00.220
<v Speaker 1>very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no reliable birth control.</v>

1237
01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:01.993
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't underestimate the radical</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of reliable birth control </v>

1238
01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:07.390
<v Speaker 1>now that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1239
01:11:07.390 --> 01:11:10.300
<v Speaker 1>that opened up the world to women and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just birth control,</v>

1240
01:11:10.301 --> 01:11:13.070
<v Speaker 1>it's a whole variety of technological </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformations.</v>

1241
01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:13.913
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also an increase in the safety of </v>

1242
01:11:16.381 --> 01:11:17.214
<v Speaker 1>the street to a hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm contributing factors that opened up </v>

1243
01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:23.053
<v Speaker 1>the world to the freedom of women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a huge part of that was the </v>

1244
01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:28.373
<v Speaker 1>collective</v>
<v Speaker 1>striving of men and women to free </v>

1245
01:11:32.731 --> 01:11:37.731
<v Speaker 1>themselves from the absolute tyranny of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand to mouth existence.</v>

1246
01:11:40.090 --> 01:11:41.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a woman was,</v>

1247
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:43.223
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say sexually mature back at that </v>

1248
01:11:44.551 --> 01:11:45.384
<v Speaker 1>time around 15 or 16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very likely to be married soon after </v>

1249
01:11:48.091 --> 01:11:48.924
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm partly because sex outside of </v>

1250
01:11:51.451 --> 01:11:52.284
<v Speaker 1>marriage was so unbelievably dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very high probability of pregnancy and </v>

1251
01:11:56.371 --> 01:12:01.230
<v Speaker 1>then of death in childbirth and then it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then death of children,</v>

1252
01:12:01.231 --> 01:12:05.700
<v Speaker 1>and then continual pregnancy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women weren't the same even biologically</v>

1253
01:12:05.701 --> 01:12:06.534
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the birth control pill is a </v>

1254
01:12:07.681 --> 01:12:12.681
<v Speaker 1>biological revolution and it took a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time to extend the full codery of rights</v>

1255
01:12:15.631 --> 01:12:17.160
<v Speaker 1>to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even man.</v>

1256
01:12:17.161 --> 01:12:18.480
<v Speaker 1>It was like Jesus.</v>

1257
01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:21.240
<v Speaker 1>Most men in eastern Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1258
01:12:21.241 --> 01:12:25.320
<v Speaker 1>were serfs until the late 18 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally slaves.</v>

1259
01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:26.180
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1260
01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:27.013
<v Speaker 1>it's not as if the common person has had</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right to vote for any substantial </v>

1261
01:12:32.431 --> 01:12:33.264
<v Speaker 1>amount of time in some countries for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of hundred years and that's all </v>

1262
01:12:36.690 --> 01:12:38.100
<v Speaker 1>like were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

1263
01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:41.450
<v Speaker 1>were clambering out of the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>darkness of,</v>

1264
01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:46.700
<v Speaker 1>of biological history and creating a </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture where people have enough freedom</v>

1265
01:12:48.901 --> 01:12:49.734
<v Speaker 1>to be to exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would optimally be their full set </v>

1266
01:12:54.001 --> 01:12:57.900
<v Speaker 1>of rights and to say that that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen at the pie in the past,</v>

1267
01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:58.793
<v Speaker 1>primarily because of the Patriarchal </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dominion of men is I think an escape </v>

1268
01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:05.093
<v Speaker 1>from full confrontation with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute dreadful horror of biological </v>

1269
01:13:09.871 --> 01:13:11.700
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an.</v>

1270
01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:12.773
<v Speaker 1>It's a wish that all of the things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>life that are deeply troublesome and </v>

1271
01:13:17.131 --> 01:13:17.964
<v Speaker 1>terrible are a consequence of the errors</v>
<v Speaker 1>made by those who control the social </v>

1272
01:13:22.561 --> 01:13:26.400
<v Speaker 1>structure and God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be really something if they had</v>

1273
01:13:26.401 --> 01:13:27.390
<v Speaker 1>that much power.</v>

1274
01:13:27.390 --> 01:13:28.081
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1275
01:13:28.081 --> 01:13:28.914
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can make things bad or good by women </v>

1276
01:13:31.531 --> 01:13:32.820
<v Speaker 1>by Fiat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1277
01:13:33.210 --> 01:13:34.043
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1278
01:13:34.050 --> 01:13:34.883
<v Speaker 1>you're facing the terrible dragon of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature and she's something awful to </v>

1279
01:13:38.251 --> 01:13:40.440
<v Speaker 1>behold and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1280
01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:42.030
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're tyrannical.</v>

1281
01:13:42.031 --> 01:13:42.864
<v Speaker 1>Patriarchy is a relatively ineffective </v>
<v Speaker 1>forest in the face of the absolute </v>

1282
01:13:47.761 --> 01:13:49.620
<v Speaker 1>depredations of Mother Nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1283
01:13:49.621 --> 01:13:50.454
<v Speaker 1>even now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're powerful technologically compared </v>

1284
01:13:52.831 --> 01:13:55.740
<v Speaker 1>to how we have been in the past and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1285
01:13:55.741 --> 01:13:56.574
<v Speaker 1>we've extended our life a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we still only manage about 80 years </v>

1286
01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:04.260
<v Speaker 1>and lot of that is still characterized </v>
<v Speaker 1>by my mental and physical illness.</v>

1287
01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:08.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're still subject to the limitations,</v>

1288
01:14:08.041 --> 01:14:08.874
<v Speaker 1>that awful limitations of biology ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are almost too terrifying to be </v>

1289
01:14:12.341 --> 01:14:15.160
<v Speaker 1>hold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we we shy away from that and say,</v>

1290
01:14:15.161 --> 01:14:16.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all,</v>

1291
01:14:16.111 --> 01:14:16.944
<v Speaker 1>all the suffering as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's oppressive and under </v>

1292
01:14:19.781 --> 01:14:21.220
<v Speaker 1>the control of human beings.</v>

1293
01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:24.370
<v Speaker 1>So like I know I wish that was the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't.</v>

1294
01:14:24.490 --> 01:14:29.230
<v Speaker 1>And that's not to say that social </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures lack corruption,</v>

1295
01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:30.333
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not as if 150 years ago all men </v>

1296
01:14:35.231 --> 01:14:36.064
<v Speaker 1>were free and all women were enslaved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth of the matter is 150 years </v>

1297
01:14:40.181 --> 01:14:42.850
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually everyone was enslaved.</v>

1298
01:14:43.690 --> 01:14:44.950
<v Speaker 1>So and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1299
01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:45.793
<v Speaker 1>it's a long bloody hole out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want a tremendous amount of </v>

1300
01:14:49.511 --> 01:14:50.344
<v Speaker 1>that has taken place over the last 130 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years with the absolute revolution in </v>

1301
01:14:55.061 --> 01:15:00.061
<v Speaker 1>living standard and an availability of </v>
<v Speaker 1>food and proliferation of consumer items</v>

1302
01:15:00.701 --> 01:15:02.590
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1303
01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:03.513
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the construction of the formulation of </v>

1304
01:15:06.911 --> 01:15:08.640
<v Speaker 1>labor saving devices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1305
01:15:08.641 --> 01:15:13.641
<v Speaker 1>that that freed women from the grinding </v>
<v Speaker 1>misery of constant domestic work for,</v>

1306
01:15:15.670 --> 01:15:18.730
<v Speaker 1>for tens of hours a week at </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily low pay.</v>

1307
01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:23.670
<v Speaker 1>And the and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the provision of a</v>

1308
01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:28.820
<v Speaker 1>universally accessible hygienic </v>
<v Speaker 1>facilities,</v>

1309
01:15:28.821 --> 01:15:29.654
<v Speaker 1>toilets everywhere is a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It allows people to move around and to </v>

1310
01:15:32.871 --> 01:15:33.704
<v Speaker 1>operate out in the world and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and tampons and sanitary products and </v>

1311
01:15:37.011 --> 01:15:39.800
<v Speaker 1>birth control and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

1312
01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:42.933
<v Speaker 1>women were oppressed because people were</v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressed and perhaps women were more </v>

1313
01:15:45.911 --> 01:15:49.870
<v Speaker 1>oppressed than men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although even that's not obvious because</v>

1314
01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:54.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men suffered brutally in warfare,</v>

1315
01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:56.050
<v Speaker 1>absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brutally,</v>

1316
01:15:56.350 --> 01:15:57.240
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1317
01:15:57.790 --> 01:15:59.560
<v Speaker 1>and died at a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a rate.</v>

1318
01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:04.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you eliminate child birth,</v>

1319
01:16:04.601 --> 01:16:05.434
<v Speaker 1>deaths from the equation died at a rate </v>
<v Speaker 1>that exceeded the rate that women died </v>

1320
01:16:09.221 --> 01:16:10.054
<v Speaker 1>at and we're required to sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves for the protection of women </v>

1321
01:16:15.161 --> 01:16:15.994
<v Speaker 1>and children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like human history is a nightmare </v>

1322
01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:21.310
<v Speaker 1>and that nightmare involves</v>

1323
01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:26.570
<v Speaker 1>incredible difficulty in struggling for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to survive.</v>

1324
01:16:27.170 --> 01:16:28.003
<v Speaker 1>And we emerged out of that men and women</v>
<v Speaker 1>together and have been attempting to </v>

1325
01:16:33.741 --> 01:16:34.574
<v Speaker 1>free each other to the degree that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's possible in the course of that </v>

1326
01:16:38.091 --> 01:16:41.630
<v Speaker 1>struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's how it looks to me.</v>

1327
01:16:46.270 --> 01:16:48.340
<v Speaker 1>You have talked about earning your </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>

1328
01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:51.690
<v Speaker 1>How do you define man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys?</v>

1329
01:16:51.691 --> 01:16:54.480
<v Speaker 1>You put up some viciously good questions</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

1330
01:16:54.481 --> 01:16:55.620
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to say,</v>

1331
01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:58.110
<v Speaker 1>these are tough questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very good question.</v>

1332
01:16:58.111 --> 01:16:58.944
<v Speaker 1>So this is devin amp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've talked about earning your </v>

1333
01:17:01.141 --> 01:17:03.570
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you define this and earn it?</v>

1334
01:17:03.810 --> 01:17:06.180
<v Speaker 1>When is it okay to debate ideas like </v>
<v Speaker 1>yours?</v>

1335
01:17:06.181 --> 01:17:11.181
<v Speaker 1>If they are not your own?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1336
01:17:12.971 --> 01:17:13.804
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's okay to debate them </v>
<v Speaker 1>right away if what you're trying to do </v>

1337
01:17:18.611 --> 01:17:21.790
<v Speaker 1>is to test them and learn more about </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1338
01:17:21.791 --> 01:17:22.624
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not okay if you're trying to </v>

1339
01:17:24.011 --> 01:17:24.844
<v Speaker 1>put them forward as if they're your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to obtain something approximating </v>

1340
01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:30.993
<v Speaker 1>unearned moral superiority by doing so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means to have the ideas and to </v>

1341
01:17:36.191 --> 01:17:39.190
<v Speaker 1>discuss them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to identify with them as if they are</v>

1342
01:17:39.191 --> 01:17:43.210
<v Speaker 1>defining characters that defining </v>
<v Speaker 1>features of your own personality,</v>

1343
01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:46.030
<v Speaker 1>how do you earn knowledge</v>

1344
01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:52.470
<v Speaker 1>well and allow your elementary school </v>
<v Speaker 1>teachers,</v>

1345
01:17:52.471 --> 01:17:53.304
<v Speaker 1>when you're writing an essay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said you got to put it in your own </v>

1346
01:17:55.291 --> 01:17:56.280
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think,</v>

1347
01:17:56.281 --> 01:17:57.180
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

1348
01:17:57.210 --> 01:18:00.150
<v Speaker 1>You can't just copy a sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be in your own words.</v>

1349
01:18:00.810 --> 01:18:04.260
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me that was never very well explained</v>

1350
01:18:04.261 --> 01:18:05.670
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was something to it.</v>

1351
01:18:05.671 --> 01:18:06.504
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

1352
01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:08.993
<v Speaker 1>for knowledge to be yours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to integrate it with your own </v>

1353
01:18:12.901 --> 01:18:17.901
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to see how that applies to your</v>

1354
01:18:18.061 --> 01:18:22.230
<v Speaker 1>own case and then have a story to tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how that's the case.</v>

1355
01:18:22.350 --> 01:18:24.000
<v Speaker 1>That's personal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1356
01:18:24.030 --> 01:18:27.900
<v Speaker 1>So it's the intermingling of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstract with the personal that makes it</v>

1357
01:18:27.930 --> 01:18:28.763
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the intermingling of the epic with </v>

1358
01:18:30.871 --> 01:18:33.150
<v Speaker 1>the particular or the archetipal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1359
01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:35.880
<v Speaker 1>with the concrete that makes something </v>
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>

1360
01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:38.730
<v Speaker 1>and so if an idea is still an </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction,</v>

1361
01:18:38.731 --> 01:18:43.110
<v Speaker 1>if you're just parroting it and it also </v>
<v Speaker 1>means that you haven't learned to use it</v>

1362
01:18:43.111 --> 01:18:43.944
<v Speaker 1>as a tool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you haven't started to apply it in your </v>

1363
01:18:45.961 --> 01:18:47.970
<v Speaker 1>own life because you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1364
01:18:47.971 --> 01:18:48.804
<v Speaker 1>here's an idea that I came across and </v>
<v Speaker 1>here's how I implemented it and here's </v>

1365
01:18:52.621 --> 01:18:56.280
<v Speaker 1>what I learned when I implemented it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that's definitely yours,</v>

1366
01:18:56.281 --> 01:18:57.114
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're and you can kind of tell </v>

1367
01:18:58.531 --> 01:19:03.531
<v Speaker 1>because you're recounting your knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a manner that no one else could do</v>

1368
01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:06.613
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what gives it that ring of </v>

1369
01:19:07.741 --> 01:19:08.980
<v Speaker 1>genuineness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1370
01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:12.140
<v Speaker 1>That's what it means in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to speak from the heart.</v>

1371
01:19:12.150 --> 01:19:12.901
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1372
01:19:12.901 --> 01:19:17.840
<v Speaker 1>here's my experience with this idea and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say to,</v>

1373
01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:20.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's how I understand this idea,</v>

1374
01:19:20.850 --> 01:19:21.683
<v Speaker 1>and you read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>formulate that in your own terms and </v>

1375
01:19:23.701 --> 01:19:26.180
<v Speaker 1>that means that you associate it with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own,</v>

1376
01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:27.213
<v Speaker 1>with the own union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the unique particularities of your </v>

1377
01:19:30.601 --> 01:19:31.434
<v Speaker 1>own experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I would also say it means that </v>

1378
01:19:33.361 --> 01:19:37.150
<v Speaker 1>you've acted out the ideas and tested </v>
<v Speaker 1>them like in,</v>

1379
01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:38.083
<v Speaker 1>in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that you have your own stories to </v>

1380
01:19:40.351 --> 01:19:44.760
<v Speaker 1>tell about that and that's how you make </v>
<v Speaker 1>it your own.</v>

1381
01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:49.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like you go to the tool store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hardware store,</v>

1382
01:19:49.831 --> 01:19:51.540
<v Speaker 1>and you buy a hammer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1383
01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:56.220
<v Speaker 1>and then you start to use the hammer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hammer in nails and you learn how to use</v>

1384
01:19:56.221 --> 01:19:57.054
<v Speaker 1>the hammer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You learn how to use the saw and then </v>

1385
01:19:58.740 --> 01:19:59.573
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at some point that saw sort of becomes </v>

1386
01:20:00.841 --> 01:20:03.030
<v Speaker 1>yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how to use it.</v>

1387
01:20:03.390 --> 01:20:06.330
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same with these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't just,</v>

1388
01:20:06.650 --> 01:20:07.483
<v Speaker 1>you don't just say the words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not just a puppet mouthing the </v>

1389
01:20:11.521 --> 01:20:12.354
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes part and parcel of your own </v>

1390
01:20:14.311 --> 01:20:17.160
<v Speaker 1>philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that you perceive the world.</v>

1391
01:20:17.850 --> 01:20:20.430
<v Speaker 1>The way that you construe things in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that you act in the world,</v>

1392
01:20:20.431 --> 01:20:22.980
<v Speaker 1>you've tested them and you have your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own.</v>

1393
01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:27.960
<v Speaker 1>You have something to add to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's yours personally.</v>

1394
01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:29.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you.</v>

1395
01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:34.320
<v Speaker 1>If you're having a discussion with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone and they're talking about things</v>

1396
01:20:34.321 --> 01:20:36.480
<v Speaker 1>that don't have those characteristics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1397
01:20:36.481 --> 01:20:37.314
<v Speaker 1>that they haven't made personal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the conversation is almost never </v>

1398
01:20:39.751 --> 01:20:42.990
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because the person is.</v>

1399
01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:45.420
<v Speaker 1>It's just an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just.</v>

1400
01:20:45.630 --> 01:20:48.060
<v Speaker 1>They really are an empty shell through </v>
<v Speaker 1>which</v>

1401
01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:53.270
<v Speaker 1>ideologues etiology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cliches and slogans are pouring.</v>

1402
01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:54.313
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing about that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>compelling because you don't see the </v>

1403
01:20:58.401 --> 01:20:59.234
<v Speaker 1>grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't see that the other person has </v>

1404
01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:02.293
<v Speaker 1>grappled with the ideas and come to </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own unique conclusions and it </v>

1405
01:21:06.471 --> 01:21:10.310
<v Speaker 1>really is in that mingling of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstract and the particular.</v>

1406
01:21:10.490 --> 01:21:15.320
<v Speaker 1>That compelling wisdom is to be found </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's,</v>

1407
01:21:15.650 --> 01:21:20.120
<v Speaker 1>that's and then concretely speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1408
01:21:20.150 --> 01:21:20.983
<v Speaker 1>there's ways of earning your knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>and part of that is reformulating it in </v>

1409
01:21:25.101 --> 01:21:26.960
<v Speaker 1>your own words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's thinking it through,</v>

1410
01:21:26.961 --> 01:21:27.794
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And discussing it until you have it at </v>

1411
01:21:30.201 --> 01:21:31.034
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can talk about it and you can </v>

1412
01:21:32.601 --> 01:21:34.970
<v Speaker 1>generalize from it because you truly </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand it,</v>

1413
01:21:35.150 --> 01:21:35.983
<v Speaker 1>but a huge part of that is also putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>it into practice and driving your own </v>

1414
01:21:39.441 --> 01:21:40.274
<v Speaker 1>conclusions as a consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of that can be done with </v>

1415
01:21:42.831 --> 01:21:43.760
<v Speaker 1>debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1416
01:21:43.790 --> 01:21:44.623
<v Speaker 1>here's an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came across and here's the idea and </v>

1417
01:21:47.151 --> 01:21:47.984
<v Speaker 1>here's what I think it means and this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>how I think it would change things if I </v>

1418
01:21:53.001 --> 01:21:53.834
<v Speaker 1>put it into practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how I understand this idea and </v>

1419
01:21:56.930 --> 01:21:58.610
<v Speaker 1>what do you think of that?</v>

1420
01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:03.110
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a good debate or discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1421
01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:05.180
<v Speaker 1>because then the other person can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1422
01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:06.133
<v Speaker 1>I don't really agree with the way you </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulated that or I don't agree with </v>

1423
01:22:08.031 --> 01:22:08.864
<v Speaker 1>your conclusions and hopefully it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>real discussion and not just one </v>

1424
01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:12.620
<v Speaker 1>upmanship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1425
01:22:12.621 --> 01:22:15.800
<v Speaker 1>because that's a pretty dull game and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

1426
01:22:16.710 --> 01:22:17.543
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you get clearer about what it is </v>

1427
01:22:18.441 --> 01:22:22.040
<v Speaker 1>that the idea is and how it is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would use it as a tool in your own life.</v>

1428
01:22:22.041 --> 01:22:24.130
<v Speaker 1>And that's the right way to think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas to.</v>

1429
01:22:24.590 --> 01:22:26.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly they're,</v>

1430
01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:27.253
<v Speaker 1>they're tools for looking at the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>with because you have to look at the </v>

1431
01:22:30.981 --> 01:22:33.320
<v Speaker 1>world with tools because you can't look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the whole world,</v>

1432
01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:34.333
<v Speaker 1>so you're looking at the world through a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tool like structure and then the ideas </v>

1433
01:22:36.711 --> 01:22:37.544
<v Speaker 1>themselves are tool like and they need </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be used and worn a bit in your hands </v>

1434
01:22:42.051 --> 01:22:44.240
<v Speaker 1>before their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before their years.</v>

1435
01:22:44.690 --> 01:22:45.523
<v Speaker 1>So have you ever thought about engaging </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a public debate with Slavoj </v>

1436
01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:50.873
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Jack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has many interesting observations on </v>

1437
01:22:52.971 --> 01:22:56.660
<v Speaker 1>the topic of videology and that would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good conversation conversation.</v>

1438
01:22:56.810 --> 01:22:59.720
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a tentative,</v>

1439
01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:01.273
<v Speaker 1>we haven't been speaking tentatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the possibility of having a </v>

1440
01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:09.370
<v Speaker 1>discussion in Toronto in April.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1441
01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:14.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're negotiating and um,</v>

1442
01:23:14.650 --> 01:23:16.000
<v Speaker 1>we'll see how that goes.</v>

1443
01:23:17.490 --> 01:23:20.070
<v Speaker 1>We'll see if he's available and if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>available,</v>

1444
01:23:20.071 --> 01:23:23.010
<v Speaker 1>if we can agree on a set of topics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we can,</v>

1445
01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:25.473
<v Speaker 1>if we can undertake all the complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>detailed negotiations necessary to make </v>

1446
01:23:30.701 --> 01:23:34.240
<v Speaker 1>something like that successful in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>public sphere.</v>

1447
01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:35.453
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm confident enough that this will </v>

1448
01:23:36.971 --> 01:23:37.804
<v Speaker 1>occur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've already done downloaded about </v>

1449
01:23:39.610 --> 01:23:40.443
<v Speaker 1>six of his books because I really want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to start understanding what he has to </v>

1450
01:23:45.610 --> 01:23:48.610
<v Speaker 1>say and think before undertaking that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1451
01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:52.153
<v Speaker 1>so yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've thought about it more than thought </v>

1452
01:23:54.981 --> 01:23:56.570
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The offer is out,</v>

1453
01:23:56.690 --> 01:23:57.523
<v Speaker 1>the negotiations are underway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you maintain a stable identity </v>

1454
01:24:03.141 --> 01:24:06.050
<v Speaker 1>when you are plagued by bouts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression and anxiety?</v>

1455
01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:08.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing we might say is that you</v>

1456
01:24:08.511 --> 01:24:10.760
<v Speaker 1>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1457
01:24:10.761 --> 01:24:13.400
<v Speaker 1>If you're playing by boats of depression</v>
<v Speaker 1>and anxiety,</v>

1458
01:24:13.401 --> 01:24:16.790
<v Speaker 1>that does destabilize your identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1459
01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:19.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost by definition,</v>

1460
01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:22.280
<v Speaker 1>but having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1461
01:24:22.281 --> 01:24:27.281
<v Speaker 1>this is when habit and plan</v>
<v Speaker 1>and strategy are so useful.</v>

1462
01:24:28.491 --> 01:24:31.070
<v Speaker 1>So in the periods of depression that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>

1463
01:24:31.490 --> 01:24:33.500
<v Speaker 1>what sustained some of them were long </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1464
01:24:33.501 --> 01:24:34.334
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and certainly the most unpleasant </v>

1465
01:24:36.501 --> 01:24:38.650
<v Speaker 1>experiences of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1466
01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:43.190
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is when you need a philosophy,</v>

1467
01:24:43.191 --> 01:24:44.024
<v Speaker 1>let's say that's aligned with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>vision and your strategy to sustain you </v>

1468
01:24:47.151 --> 01:24:51.680
<v Speaker 1>because what would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would happen to me is that I know I</v>

1469
01:24:51.681 --> 01:24:52.514
<v Speaker 1>have these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a vision and I suppose the vision is of </v>

1470
01:24:55.101 --> 01:24:55.934
<v Speaker 1>a world that's better in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in it's less likely to descend into </v>

1471
01:25:01.401 --> 01:25:02.234
<v Speaker 1>ideological catastrophe and where people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are more responsible and more awake and </v>

1472
01:25:07.190 --> 01:25:08.950
<v Speaker 1>more educated and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1473
01:25:09.250 --> 01:25:11.210
<v Speaker 1>and healthier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that,</v>

1474
01:25:11.230 --> 01:25:13.410
<v Speaker 1>a vision of a better world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1475
01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:14.413
<v Speaker 1>a world that's less hellish at least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also a better world and some sense </v>

1476
01:25:18.441 --> 01:25:20.510
<v Speaker 1>of what role I might play in that.</v>

1477
01:25:20.830 --> 01:25:22.940
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's very motivating.</v>

1478
01:25:22.941 --> 01:25:27.230
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a profound goal too to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make things better.</v>

1479
01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:29.750
<v Speaker 1>And you can do that locally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do that for yourself,</v>

1480
01:25:29.751 --> 01:25:30.584
<v Speaker 1>you can do that for your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do that for the broader </v>

1481
01:25:32.451 --> 01:25:34.280
<v Speaker 1>community and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's worth it,</v>

1482
01:25:34.281 --> 01:25:36.350
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's worth making some sacrifices for.</v>

1483
01:25:36.351 --> 01:25:41.351
<v Speaker 1>It's worth suffering for to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you decompose that into the day</v>

1484
01:25:42.141 --> 01:25:42.974
<v Speaker 1>to day and week to week strategies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>actions that you're undertaking the </v>

1485
01:25:46.581 --> 01:25:47.360
<v Speaker 1>plans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1486
01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:47.950
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1487
01:25:47.950 --> 01:25:52.950
<v Speaker 1>and the activities that you're putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward to make that dream a reality,</v>

1488
01:25:53.150 --> 01:25:57.110
<v Speaker 1>to realize it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when the depression and anxiety</v>

1489
01:25:57.111 --> 01:25:59.990
<v Speaker 1>come along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think part of it with depression,</v>

1490
01:25:59.991 --> 01:26:00.824
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's just bloody endurance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like get up and you work through </v>

1491
01:26:05.121 --> 01:26:07.700
<v Speaker 1>the next hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You try to stay on track,</v>

1492
01:26:07.701 --> 01:26:08.534
<v Speaker 1>you try to implement your strategic </v>
<v Speaker 1>plans to the best of your ability and </v>

1493
01:26:12.081 --> 01:26:15.380
<v Speaker 1>you hope and you pray that you'll get </v>
<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>

1494
01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:20.440
<v Speaker 1>You'll get through it and that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>darkness will recede and you,</v>

1495
01:26:20.690 --> 01:26:21.370
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1496
01:26:21.370 --> 01:26:24.950
<v Speaker 1>you stay on track,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you eat even though you're not hungry,</v>

1497
01:26:24.951 --> 01:26:27.890
<v Speaker 1>you get off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though you want to stay in bed,</v>

1498
01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:31.340
<v Speaker 1>you interact with people even though </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd rather be alone.</v>

1499
01:26:31.670 --> 01:26:32.570
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1500
01:26:32.630 --> 01:26:33.463
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the benefit of discipline habits </v>

1501
01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:39.260
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can sustain you.</v>

1502
01:26:39.261 --> 01:26:40.094
<v Speaker 1>It's like the boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're rowing in through a terrible </v>

1503
01:26:42.141 --> 01:26:42.974
<v Speaker 1>storm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaks and all and maybe you'll be </v>

1504
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:45.703
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have the boat and you can roll </v>

1505
01:26:47.481 --> 01:26:48.314
<v Speaker 1>forward and that's what you've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when durance is a huge part of </v>

1506
01:26:51.711 --> 01:26:54.560
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I would say with it's anxiety,</v>

1507
01:26:54.561 --> 01:26:55.394
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like are very much the same as </v>

1508
01:26:58.130 --> 01:26:58.963
<v Speaker 1>you're terrified and and uncertain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you move ahead to the best of your </v>

1509
01:27:03.471 --> 01:27:04.304
<v Speaker 1>ability and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you operate at least to some degree on </v>

1510
01:27:07.191 --> 01:27:08.024
<v Speaker 1>hope and if you haven't got hope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you've got blind bloody endurance </v>

1511
01:27:11.390 --> 01:27:12.223
<v Speaker 1>and that's all motivated by some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're working towards something </v>

1512
01:27:15.681 --> 01:27:18.400
<v Speaker 1>that's worthwhile working toward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1513
01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:22.520
<v Speaker 1>and that is while that's your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm wellbeing,</v>

1514
01:27:22.730 --> 01:27:23.563
<v Speaker 1>to treat yourself properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the stability and productivity and </v>

1515
01:27:26.931 --> 01:27:28.880
<v Speaker 1>harmony and health of your family.</v>

1516
01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:29.893
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's whatever benefit you can </v>

1517
01:27:32.391 --> 01:27:33.224
<v Speaker 1>be to the community and if you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>limp along and drag yourself forward in </v>

1518
01:27:38.271 --> 01:27:39.104
<v Speaker 1>order to maintain that pathway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then so be it because it's better than </v>

1519
01:27:44.421 --> 01:27:45.410
<v Speaker 1>the alternative.</v>

1520
01:27:48.750 --> 01:27:49.561
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not,</v>

1521
01:27:49.561 --> 01:27:53.280
<v Speaker 1>and I know that you can become depressed</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough so that you know you're virtually</v>

1522
01:27:53.281 --> 01:27:54.114
<v Speaker 1>a mobilized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you do what you can to fight it and </v>

1523
01:27:57.361 --> 01:27:58.194
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you do what you can to treat </v>

1524
01:27:59.461 --> 01:27:59.911
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1525
01:27:59.911 --> 01:28:03.450
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you tried antidepressants?</v>

1526
01:28:03.451 --> 01:28:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Have you gone to speak to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional?</v>

1527
01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Have you done what you need to do to </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigate?</v>

1528
01:28:10.591 --> 01:28:11.424
<v Speaker 1>The causes of your depression and </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety because often there's physical </v>

1529
01:28:14.731 --> 01:28:16.950
<v Speaker 1>reasons that that might be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1530
01:28:16.951 --> 01:28:17.784
<v Speaker 1>like I've learned notoriously that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fair bit of the negative emotion that I </v>

1531
01:28:21.211 --> 01:28:22.044
<v Speaker 1>experienced to seem to be associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with an auto immune problem that was </v>

1532
01:28:24.961 --> 01:28:27.420
<v Speaker 1>associated with food sensitivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

1533
01:28:27.421 --> 01:28:28.254
<v Speaker 1>Like I hadn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have never believed that was </v>

1534
01:28:31.201 --> 01:28:33.360
<v Speaker 1>possible 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though I did.</v>

1535
01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:34.313
<v Speaker 1>I had learned by that point that my </v>
<v Speaker 1>susceptibility to negative emotion was </v>

1536
01:28:39.331 --> 01:28:41.940
<v Speaker 1>definitely exacerbated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

1537
01:28:41.941 --> 01:28:42.774
<v Speaker 1>if I was hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I knew there was some relationship </v>

1538
01:28:45.001 --> 01:28:45.834
<v Speaker 1>with food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had no idea that it was as </v>

1539
01:28:46.871 --> 01:28:49.650
<v Speaker 1>profound as it turned out to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1540
01:28:50.150 --> 01:28:52.050
<v Speaker 1>but don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>

1541
01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:55.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing you can do too is that</v>

1542
01:28:56.990 --> 01:28:59.690
<v Speaker 1>as the negative emotion ramps up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>intensity,</v>

1543
01:28:59.870 --> 01:29:04.410
<v Speaker 1>the amount of time you construe as </v>
<v Speaker 1>manageable shrinks,</v>

1544
01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:05.513
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're extremely depressed and </v>

1545
01:29:06.990 --> 01:29:10.860
<v Speaker 1>anxious that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may be struggling to get through the</v>

1546
01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:11.693
<v Speaker 1>day and then you need a map of what is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to constitute a minimally </v>

1547
01:29:18.331 --> 01:29:19.164
<v Speaker 1>acceptable day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that might be one where you'd done </v>

1548
01:29:22.171 --> 01:29:24.270
<v Speaker 1>what you need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that when you wake up to moral,</v>

1549
01:29:24.271 --> 01:29:26.310
<v Speaker 1>things aren't worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1550
01:29:26.311 --> 01:29:27.144
<v Speaker 1>You have to keep up with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>obligations and your duties at least </v>

1551
01:29:29.941 --> 01:29:32.790
<v Speaker 1>enough so that you're not degenerating </v>
<v Speaker 1>downhill.</v>

1552
01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:34.493
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

1553
01:29:39.980 --> 01:29:42.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing too is that you,</v>

1554
01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:43.043
<v Speaker 1>you also learn that you act out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you would do when you're </v>

1555
01:29:47.331 --> 01:29:49.250
<v Speaker 1>normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when you're depressed,</v>

1556
01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:51.350
<v Speaker 1>you know you don't want to see people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1557
01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:52.263
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter you go see them </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's better than not seeing </v>

1558
01:29:54.951 --> 01:29:55.641
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1559
01:29:55.641 --> 01:29:57.590
<v Speaker 1>when you find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you do see them that it's better,</v>

1560
01:29:57.591 --> 01:29:58.424
<v Speaker 1>it'll go better than you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't isolate yourself and </v>

1561
01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:03.830
<v Speaker 1>you're anxious and so you want to avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to go out.</v>

1562
01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:04.953
<v Speaker 1>You'd rather stay home and sit in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chair and just sit there and like in a </v>

1563
01:30:07.521 --> 01:30:09.830
<v Speaker 1>frozen position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you can't do that.</v>

1564
01:30:09.831 --> 01:30:10.664
<v Speaker 1>You have to go out and go grocery </v>
<v Speaker 1>shopping and go out and have coffee and </v>

1565
01:30:13.671 --> 01:30:14.504
<v Speaker 1>all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter whether you enjoyed </v>

1566
01:30:15.841 --> 01:30:16.674
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it matters that you do them because </v>

1567
01:30:18.141 --> 01:30:18.974
<v Speaker 1>that's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do in order to maintain </v>

1568
01:30:21.171 --> 01:30:22.330
<v Speaker 1>your health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1569
01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:23.393
<v Speaker 1>and so a huge part of it is like head </v>
<v Speaker 1>down in Durham and that'll get you </v>

1570
01:30:28.371 --> 01:30:30.230
<v Speaker 1>through bad times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That endurance,</v>

1571
01:30:30.231 --> 01:30:30.870
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1572
01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:31.703
<v Speaker 1>it's such an under represented virtue </v>
<v Speaker 1>that ability to trudge forward under a </v>

1573
01:30:38.270 --> 01:30:42.470
<v Speaker 1>trudge forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unhappily under a unfairly burden.</v>

1574
01:30:42.471 --> 01:30:45.500
<v Speaker 1>Some loan is a testament to character if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

1575
01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:47.720
<v Speaker 1>and it's something that should be</v>

1576
01:30:49.930 --> 01:30:54.930
<v Speaker 1>encouraged and valued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1577
01:30:55.651 --> 01:30:56.484
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not making the claim that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are depressed who can't get out of </v>

1578
01:31:00.181 --> 01:31:01.014
<v Speaker 1>bed lack endurance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some do and some don't because </v>

1579
01:31:03.811 --> 01:31:04.644
<v Speaker 1>depression comes in very varied degrees </v>
<v Speaker 1>of intensity in and you can be laid out </v>

1580
01:31:10.801 --> 01:31:15.801
<v Speaker 1>completely or depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not trying to make some arbitrary</v>

1581
01:31:15.931 --> 01:31:18.750
<v Speaker 1>judgment about who's gone into Europe </v>
<v Speaker 1>and who hasn't.</v>

1582
01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:19.913
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that from outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I can say that endurance is one of </v>

1583
01:31:23.461 --> 01:31:28.461
<v Speaker 1>the tools you have to deal with chronic </v>
<v Speaker 1>discomfort and pain,</v>

1584
01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:31.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even if you have chronic pain,</v>

1585
01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:34.140
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting because it's very much </v>
<v Speaker 1>allied with depression.</v>

1586
01:31:34.141 --> 01:31:37.440
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the research on chronic pain,</v>

1587
01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:38.580
<v Speaker 1>back pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1588
01:31:38.581 --> 01:31:39.414
<v Speaker 1>indicates and chronic pain have all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts is that the more you allow your </v>

1589
01:31:43.831 --> 01:31:46.290
<v Speaker 1>pain to render,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you inactive,</v>

1590
01:31:46.710 --> 01:31:47.543
<v Speaker 1>the worst outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including exacerbation of the pain and </v>

1591
01:31:51.211 --> 01:31:52.044
<v Speaker 1>depression is a pain disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's very much worth thinking </v>

1592
01:31:54.871 --> 01:31:57.240
<v Speaker 1>about too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like move forward,</v>

1593
01:31:57.300 --> 01:31:59.220
<v Speaker 1>move forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>move</v>

1594
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:01.833
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you need to talk to somebody </v>

1595
01:32:02.681 --> 01:32:05.920
<v Speaker 1>about what your plan is for the day or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hour or the week,</v>

1596
01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:10.660
<v Speaker 1>then do that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And perhaps you also have helped get the</v>

1597
01:32:10.661 --> 01:32:11.494
<v Speaker 1>people around you to help a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need a little bit of help getting up </v>

1598
01:32:13.511 --> 01:32:14.344
<v Speaker 1>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to have breakfast made for me so </v>

1599
01:32:16.811 --> 01:32:17.644
<v Speaker 1>that all I do when I get up in my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my terrible state of fog and </v>

1600
01:32:20.741 --> 01:32:21.574
<v Speaker 1>confusion and terrible anxiety and </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression is I have a shower because </v>

1601
01:32:24.581 --> 01:32:25.414
<v Speaker 1>that's what happens first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next thing is I eat and </v>

1602
01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:28.833
<v Speaker 1>then that's better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're at least you're out of bed and </v>

1603
01:32:30.091 --> 01:32:32.350
<v Speaker 1>moving and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a start.</v>

1604
01:32:32.351 --> 01:32:33.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

1605
01:32:35.610 --> 01:32:38.850
<v Speaker 1>and then you indira and hope and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>how it is.</v>

1606
01:32:39.090 --> 01:32:39.923
<v Speaker 1>And you do the same thing when someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your family is sick or when you're </v>

1607
01:32:42.151 --> 01:32:44.100
<v Speaker 1>facing a death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>

1608
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:48.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like one bloody foot in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other up the hill.</v>

1609
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:55.460
<v Speaker 1>How are you always so consistently </v>
<v Speaker 1>composed and confident?</v>

1610
01:32:56.410 --> 01:32:57.243
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1611
01:32:57.890 --> 01:32:59.360
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that I am.</v>

1612
01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:00.793
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1613
01:33:04.010 --> 01:33:05.090
<v Speaker 1>I know what you mean.</v>

1614
01:33:07.410 --> 01:33:07.921
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1615
01:33:07.921 --> 01:33:08.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1616
01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:10.113
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just about 60 years old and so I </v>

1617
01:33:12.421 --> 01:33:13.254
<v Speaker 1>have a lot of experience behind me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen a lot of things and I've </v>

1618
01:33:16.441 --> 01:33:19.790
<v Speaker 1>learned to be detached to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1619
01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:20.633
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing you learned as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinician as people are always talking </v>

1620
01:33:22.621 --> 01:33:23.454
<v Speaker 1>to you about terrible things and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficulties in their life and you can </v>

1621
01:33:27.331 --> 01:33:32.331
<v Speaker 1>take that home and have it destroy you </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're constantly exposed to the</v>

1622
01:33:34.891 --> 01:33:37.740
<v Speaker 1>troubles of existence and they're real </v>
<v Speaker 1>troubles.</v>

1623
01:33:37.741 --> 01:33:38.600
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1624
01:33:38.730 --> 01:33:39.563
<v Speaker 1>it's not unique to clinicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that with physicians in </v>

1625
01:33:43.290 --> 01:33:48.290
<v Speaker 1>Palliative care workers and people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>work in morgues and emergency responders</v>

1626
01:33:49.321 --> 01:33:52.350
<v Speaker 1>and like there's lots of people who face</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1627
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:55.620
<v Speaker 1>the very difficult aspects of life very </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequently.</v>

1628
01:33:58.110 --> 01:34:00.270
<v Speaker 1>You detach yourself from it to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>

1629
01:34:00.271 --> 01:34:03.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't mean in a disinterested way,</v>

1630
01:34:04.100 --> 01:34:04.933
<v Speaker 1>I mean in a,</v>

1631
01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:11.140
<v Speaker 1>in a way that is sort of allied with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer term view.</v>

1632
01:34:11.490 --> 01:34:13.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I'm doing an interview now with,</v>

1633
01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:17.890
<v Speaker 1>with someone who's attacking me and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can get irritable.</v>

1634
01:34:17.891 --> 01:34:20.380
<v Speaker 1>I think I was too irritable in the Gq </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview,</v>

1635
01:34:20.381 --> 01:34:22.330
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which some of you might've watched.</v>

1636
01:34:23.170 --> 01:34:24.003
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm not going to jump to </v>

1637
01:34:25.511 --> 01:34:27.940
<v Speaker 1>conclusions about how this is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

1638
01:34:28.630 --> 01:34:31.660
<v Speaker 1>Even even with regards to how it feels </v>
<v Speaker 1>right in the moment.</v>

1639
01:34:31.661 --> 01:34:32.494
<v Speaker 1>We'll see how it unfolds across time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll try to manage myself in the moment </v>

1640
01:34:37.241 --> 01:34:41.230
<v Speaker 1>with the least amount of upset that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can manage.</v>

1641
01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:46.060
<v Speaker 1>And it's part of the doctrine of minimal</v>
<v Speaker 1>minimal necessary force.</v>

1642
01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:49.270
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I've learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're.</v>

1643
01:34:49.660 --> 01:34:50.493
<v Speaker 1>If you have a dispute with someone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it needs to be settled and maybe they </v>

1644
01:34:55.721 --> 01:34:56.554
<v Speaker 1>need to change than you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not always the case because </v>

1645
01:34:59.811 --> 01:35:02.180
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the saddling requires change </v>
<v Speaker 1>on your part,</v>

1646
01:35:02.181 --> 01:35:03.014
<v Speaker 1>but let's say that they have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>defeated in some sense in comparison to </v>

1647
01:35:07.341 --> 01:35:08.174
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to defeat them any more </v>

1648
01:35:09.381 --> 01:35:10.580
<v Speaker 1>than necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1649
01:35:10.581 --> 01:35:11.414
<v Speaker 1>it's like you don't knock your opponent </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the ground and then jump up and down </v>

1650
01:35:14.511 --> 01:35:17.270
<v Speaker 1>on them three or four times in triumph.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1651
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:18.380
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1652
01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:20.053
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1653
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:23.270
<v Speaker 1>you pin them in London and then let them</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1654
01:35:24.260 --> 01:35:25.093
<v Speaker 1>Minimal necessary force because any more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than that just produces a counter </v>

1655
01:35:31.161 --> 01:35:33.290
<v Speaker 1>reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1656
01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:41.060
<v Speaker 1>and I guess the other thing is too is my</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation when I'm engaged,</v>

1657
01:35:41.090 --> 01:35:41.923
<v Speaker 1>let's say in these discussions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that I'm not trying to win the </v>

1658
01:35:45.111 --> 01:35:48.170
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to win.</v>

1659
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:53.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to say what I think as </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly as I can.</v>

1660
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:56.450
<v Speaker 1>And there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There might be an element.</v>

1661
01:35:57.050 --> 01:35:57.883
<v Speaker 1>There might be one of the consequences </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that might be what appears to be a </v>

1662
01:36:01.641 --> 01:36:02.510
<v Speaker 1>victory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1663
01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:09.040
<v Speaker 1>the victory is a victory for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to articulate what you believe</v>

1664
01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:11.953
<v Speaker 1>and that's what I'm trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's another reason to stay </v>

1665
01:36:15.321 --> 01:36:16.370
<v Speaker 1>composed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1666
01:36:16.371 --> 01:36:17.204
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1667
01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:20.540
<v Speaker 1>this person has just thrown a curve ball</v>
<v Speaker 1>at me.</v>

1668
01:36:20.541 --> 01:36:21.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1669
01:36:21.381 --> 01:36:26.090
<v Speaker 1>so well</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could be thinking,</v>

1670
01:36:26.091 --> 01:36:26.924
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be undermined by that </v>

1671
01:36:27.801 --> 01:36:30.650
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want to make a fool of </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself and I don't want to be put on the</v>

1672
01:36:30.651 --> 01:36:31.484
<v Speaker 1>spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course all of those things are </v>

1673
01:36:32.211 --> 01:36:34.700
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mostly what I'm thinking about is,</v>

1674
01:36:34.701 --> 01:36:36.590
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well now I've got that question.</v>

1675
01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:42.440
<v Speaker 1>I want to answer as truthfully as I </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly can.</v>

1676
01:36:42.890 --> 01:36:47.420
<v Speaker 1>What do I think about what was just sad </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not calculating the outcome.</v>

1677
01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:51.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming this is a mark of faith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1678
01:36:51.911 --> 01:36:55.990
<v Speaker 1>This is the faith that that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people have talked about</v>

1679
01:36:57.940 --> 01:37:02.940
<v Speaker 1>being something that has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifested necessarily.</v>

1680
01:37:03.450 --> 01:37:05.560
<v Speaker 1>It'd be talking about this since the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dawn of time.</v>

1681
01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:06.633
<v Speaker 1>What's the faith?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The faith is that if you say what you </v>

1682
01:37:09.791 --> 01:37:10.624
<v Speaker 1>believe to be true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then whatever happens is the best thing </v>

1683
01:37:14.351 --> 01:37:17.740
<v Speaker 1>that could've happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I believe that,</v>

1684
01:37:18.010 --> 01:37:18.843
<v Speaker 1>so that's what I really believe it </v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because I believe that if you're </v>

1685
01:37:22.721 --> 01:37:25.390
<v Speaker 1>deceitful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the opposite of that,</v>

1686
01:37:25.450 --> 01:37:27.940
<v Speaker 1>or manipulative or malicious or </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolent,</v>

1687
01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:29.673
<v Speaker 1>but maybe primarily manipulative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what you're acting out is your </v>

1688
01:37:33.131 --> 01:37:38.131
<v Speaker 1>belief that deceit will bring victory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just don't believe that at all.</v>

1689
01:37:39.281 --> 01:37:40.410
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1690
01:37:40.490 --> 01:37:45.490
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a preposterous claim and </v>
<v Speaker 1>seek won't bring victory.</v>

1691
01:37:46.150 --> 01:37:46.983
<v Speaker 1>Then truth is what brings victory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there is such a thing as truth and </v>

1692
01:37:51.121 --> 01:37:52.900
<v Speaker 1>there's certainly such a thing as </v>
<v Speaker 1>deceit,</v>

1693
01:37:53.170 --> 01:37:58.170
<v Speaker 1>so there must be such a thing as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so some of it's just curiosity too.</v>

1694
01:37:59.911 --> 01:38:00.744
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1695
01:38:01.050 --> 01:38:03.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say what I think and see </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens now.</v>

1696
01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:05.460
<v Speaker 1>It's an adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1697
01:38:05.461 --> 01:38:07.980
<v Speaker 1>that's the adventure of your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1698
01:38:07.981 --> 01:38:11.490
<v Speaker 1>and you don't want to miss that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you've got in your life,</v>

1699
01:38:11.491 --> 01:38:15.750
<v Speaker 1>is for it to be an adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an easy road.</v>

1700
01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:16.853
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a stormy sea and what you have is </v>

1701
01:38:20.311 --> 01:38:24.420
<v Speaker 1>the adventure of contending with God and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the waves.</v>

1702
01:38:24.630 --> 01:38:26.460
<v Speaker 1>That's what you have and</v>

1703
01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:29.873
<v Speaker 1>the way you do that is with truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that sort of takes you out of </v>

1704
01:38:35.641 --> 01:38:40.110
<v Speaker 1>that</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediacy of the conflict.</v>

1705
01:38:40.530 --> 01:38:44.520
<v Speaker 1>Whoever it is that the conflict with </v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever it is that you're talking to,</v>

1706
01:38:46.110 --> 01:38:48.630
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to ally yourself with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's</v>

1707
01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:53.850
<v Speaker 1>deeper and more profound and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>elastic.</v>

1708
01:38:58.180 --> 01:39:00.200
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't think that I am pretty good</v>

1709
01:39:00.201 --> 01:39:04.780
<v Speaker 1>at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consistently composed and confident,</v>

1710
01:39:05.180 --> 01:39:07.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I have faith in the truth.</v>

1711
01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Start the same thing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an emotional person</v>

1712
01:39:18.110 --> 01:39:19.010
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

1713
01:39:22.970 --> 01:39:25.250
<v Speaker 1>How do you manage to read so much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1714
01:39:25.251 --> 01:39:27.770
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that's good fortune,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1715
01:39:27.771 --> 01:39:32.420
<v Speaker 1>like I seem to have a knack for reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

1716
01:39:33.690 --> 01:39:35.840
<v Speaker 1>it was a gift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1717
01:39:35.841 --> 01:39:39.710
<v Speaker 1>like when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I look at a word once,</v>

1718
01:39:39.711 --> 01:39:42.830
<v Speaker 1>I can always spell it like I have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantly.</v>

1719
01:39:43.370 --> 01:39:45.260
<v Speaker 1>And I've been like that ever since I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>little.</v>

1720
01:39:45.261 --> 01:39:49.670
<v Speaker 1>And so I seem to have a facility for </v>
<v Speaker 1>very rapid verbal comprehension and then</v>

1721
01:39:49.671 --> 01:39:50.504
<v Speaker 1>my father taught me to read when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>very young and I think it was the </v>

1722
01:39:52.881 --> 01:39:56.270
<v Speaker 1>combination of those two things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>enabled that for me.</v>

1723
01:39:56.660 --> 01:39:57.493
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the natural proclivity of verbal </v>

1724
01:39:58.911 --> 01:40:00.200
<v Speaker 1>ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1725
01:40:00.201 --> 01:40:00.680
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1726
01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:03.050
<v Speaker 1>my graduate supervisor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart guy,</v>

1727
01:40:03.051 --> 01:40:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Robert Peel Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really liked,</v>

1728
01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:08.280
<v Speaker 1>he had trouble with spelling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1729
01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:09.673
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have different talents and I had </v>

1730
01:40:14.031 --> 01:40:18.540
<v Speaker 1>to tell it for immediate recognition and</v>
<v Speaker 1>memory of words and,</v>

1731
01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:19.580
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1732
01:40:20.060 --> 01:40:23.090
<v Speaker 1>and I'm also very verbally fluent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me a sec here.</v>

1733
01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:34.033
<v Speaker 1>So I think mostly it's an innate talent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I also do know that the more you </v>

1734
01:40:39.171 --> 01:40:40.760
<v Speaker 1>read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>

1735
01:40:40.761 --> 01:40:42.790
<v Speaker 1>the faster you get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1736
01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:44.420
<v Speaker 1>my wife has really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1737
01:40:44.421 --> 01:40:45.254
<v Speaker 1>she always read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's really started to read more </v>

1738
01:40:47.030 --> 01:40:47.863
<v Speaker 1>since you've gone to Kendall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She turns out she really likes her </v>

1739
01:40:49.551 --> 01:40:51.740
<v Speaker 1>kindle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She reads a lot more in her reading.</v>

1740
01:40:51.741 --> 01:40:53.110
<v Speaker 1>Speed is increased.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot.</v>

1741
01:40:53.430 --> 01:40:54.263
<v Speaker 1>Lot of it's practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can try to speed up your reading by </v>

1742
01:40:59.411 --> 01:41:02.290
<v Speaker 1>reading a little faster than you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable with</v>

1743
01:41:03.850 --> 01:41:04.683
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the research literature </v>

1744
01:41:06.850 --> 01:41:11.850
<v Speaker 1>indicating the utility of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but practice is always useful.</v>

1745
01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:13.773
<v Speaker 1>The other thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you want to make it part of </v>

1746
01:41:15.850 --> 01:41:16.683
<v Speaker 1>habit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You both conceptually and practically a </v>

1747
01:41:20.231 --> 01:41:22.750
<v Speaker 1>lot of people don't read because they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid of books.</v>

1748
01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:26.500
<v Speaker 1>Books aren't their friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you might want to get a few books and</v>

1749
01:41:26.501 --> 01:41:27.820
<v Speaker 1>kind of make them your friend.</v>

1750
01:41:29.260 --> 01:41:32.130
<v Speaker 1>You can start with simpler books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1751
01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:32.973
<v Speaker 1>like fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of good fiction writ </v>

1752
01:41:35.110 --> 01:41:39.160
<v Speaker 1>written for adolescents and children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty straightforward when you can</v>

1753
01:41:39.161 --> 01:41:42.370
<v Speaker 1>start there if you're interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy,</v>

1754
01:41:42.371 --> 01:41:47.230
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of simple guides like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idiot's guide to,</v>

1755
01:41:47.850 --> 01:41:50.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different topics or a beginner's guide.</v>

1756
01:41:50.830 --> 01:41:55.240
<v Speaker 1>I read those things all the time when </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm first investigating a new topic,</v>

1757
01:41:55.730 --> 01:41:57.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I start with the introductory material,</v>

1758
01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:00.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I make time for reading,</v>

1759
01:42:00.470 --> 01:42:03.790
<v Speaker 1>like what was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was encouraged in my family.</v>

1760
01:42:03.791 --> 01:42:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Like I always read before I went to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep,</v>

1761
01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:10.920
<v Speaker 1>I read and I still do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm somewhat less so because I've become</v>

1762
01:42:12.701 --> 01:42:15.840
<v Speaker 1>so distracted by social media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1763
01:42:15.841 --> 01:42:18.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you set aside a bit of time every day to</v>

1764
01:42:18.671 --> 01:42:19.504
<v Speaker 1>read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me it was always just before I </v>

1765
01:42:20.291 --> 01:42:21.250
<v Speaker 1>went to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to bed,</v>

1766
01:42:21.251 --> 01:42:24.130
<v Speaker 1>turn on the light and read for when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a kid for hours,</v>

1767
01:42:24.131 --> 01:42:28.360
<v Speaker 1>but and if you do something every day </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do a lot of it.</v>

1768
01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:29.620
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1769
01:42:29.621 --> 01:42:32.510
<v Speaker 1>if you want to read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to make yourself educated is</v>

1770
01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:36.670
<v Speaker 1>put aside 20 minutes a day to read or </v>
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

1771
01:42:37.130 --> 01:42:39.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some small amount of time that you could</v>

1772
01:42:39.191 --> 01:42:41.890
<v Speaker 1>actually steal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Two hours because good luck,</v>

1773
01:42:41.891 --> 01:42:44.440
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very unlikely you'll manage that.</v>

1774
01:42:44.441 --> 01:42:46.900
<v Speaker 1>But 20 minutes a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1775
01:42:46.901 --> 01:42:51.901
<v Speaker 1>that's two hours a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's 700 hours a year.</v>

1776
01:42:52.450 --> 01:42:55.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's even if you're a slow reader,</v>

1777
01:42:55.391 --> 01:42:56.224
<v Speaker 1>that's a good number of books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you make it a habitual part of </v>

1778
01:43:00.341 --> 01:43:04.360
<v Speaker 1>your life and you decide that it's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be something that you value.</v>

1779
01:43:04.630 --> 01:43:05.463
<v Speaker 1>You investigate carefully what </v>
<v Speaker 1>resistances you might have to that idea </v>

1780
01:43:09.341 --> 01:43:10.174
<v Speaker 1>because you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a pseudo intellectual or </v>

1781
01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:16.750
<v Speaker 1>there's something more productive I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be doing.</v>

1782
01:43:16.751 --> 01:43:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Or I'm intimidated by books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I hate books because I wasn't good at</v>

1783
01:43:20.291 --> 01:43:23.470
<v Speaker 1>reading when I was a kid and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>humiliated because of it.</v>

1784
01:43:23.470 --> 01:43:24.303
<v Speaker 1>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got something against </v>

1785
01:43:25.541 --> 01:43:26.374
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals or God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there might all sorts of resistances to </v>

1786
01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:33.640
<v Speaker 1>picking up a book and then you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to audio books.</v>

1787
01:43:33.670 --> 01:43:36.760
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way around that by hook or</v>
<v Speaker 1>by Crook,</v>

1788
01:43:36.761 --> 01:43:40.300
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you value it.</v>

1789
01:43:40.301 --> 01:43:41.134
<v Speaker 1>You make it a regular part of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You practice doing it and you need a </v>

1790
01:43:45.401 --> 01:43:46.810
<v Speaker 1>higher goal too is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1791
01:43:46.811 --> 01:43:51.740
<v Speaker 1>why should you read well and so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're more informed and you can better?</v>

1792
01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:52.953
<v Speaker 1>Why should you be more informed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>think better because you won't walk </v>

1793
01:43:55.671 --> 01:43:56.504
<v Speaker 1>blindly into so many pits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you'll be able to negotiate </v>

1794
01:44:00.471 --> 01:44:01.304
<v Speaker 1>better in your life because you'll be </v>
<v Speaker 1>more informed and more verbally fluent </v>

1795
01:44:06.201 --> 01:44:09.740
<v Speaker 1>and you'll have a better sense of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world works and be able to hold your</v>

1796
01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:13.400
<v Speaker 1>own in conversations and that'll make </v>
<v Speaker 1>you more confident.</v>

1797
01:44:13.670 --> 01:44:17.960
<v Speaker 1>Those are all unbelievably good reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be highly literate.</v>

1798
01:44:17.961 --> 01:44:22.220
<v Speaker 1>This is an incredibly massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive advantage.</v>

1799
01:44:22.850 --> 01:44:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Practical advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1800
01:44:24.590 --> 01:44:27.890
<v Speaker 1>and it shouldn't be underestimated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1801
01:44:34.890 --> 01:44:35.723
<v Speaker 1>there are many drug addicted mentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>ill homeless people in my city and it </v>

1802
01:44:38.131 --> 01:44:38.964
<v Speaker 1>seems to keep getting worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we help people who don't want to </v>

1803
01:44:41.221 --> 01:44:42.054
<v Speaker 1>be helped?</v>

1804
01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you do that by example.</v>

1805
01:44:46.811 --> 01:44:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1806
01:44:48.820 --> 01:44:49.653
<v Speaker 1>there isn't any other way I know of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help people who don't want to be </v>

1807
01:44:52.031 --> 01:44:52.864
<v Speaker 1>helped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I guess I think what you do is </v>

1808
01:45:03.461 --> 01:45:08.461
<v Speaker 1>you open up you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing I've said many times</v>

1809
01:45:08.711 --> 01:45:09.544
<v Speaker 1>is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do what you can to make the things </v>

1810
01:45:12.531 --> 01:45:15.290
<v Speaker 1>around you better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better your family better.</v>

1811
01:45:15.291 --> 01:45:16.124
<v Speaker 1>And then whatever you can manage in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>community know if you're interested in </v>

1812
01:45:22.070 --> 01:45:25.730
<v Speaker 1>drug addicted and mentally ill know </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are volunteer,</v>

1813
01:45:25.850 --> 01:45:26.683
<v Speaker 1>you can volunteer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can talk to those people and listen </v>

1814
01:45:31.260 --> 01:45:32.093
<v Speaker 1>because then you'd find out what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell their problems are and then you'd </v>

1815
01:45:34.021 --> 01:45:36.270
<v Speaker 1>have some sense about how they might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>helped,</v>

1816
01:45:36.750 --> 01:45:38.130
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's a hard thing.</v>

1817
01:45:38.250 --> 01:45:41.100
<v Speaker 1>There's no helping from above</v>

1818
01:45:42.550 --> 01:45:45.340
<v Speaker 1>drug addiction and its combination with </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental illness.</v>

1819
01:45:45.341 --> 01:45:48.670
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievably complicated problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no simple solutions.</v>

1820
01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:50.073
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't even necessarily obvious </v>

1821
01:45:51.911 --> 01:45:52.744
<v Speaker 1>that the people that you see who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>homeless and drug addicted mentally ill </v>

1822
01:45:55.840 --> 01:45:56.673
<v Speaker 1>don't want to be helped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that sometimes they have problems </v>

1823
01:45:59.111 --> 01:46:04.111
<v Speaker 1>that are so absolutely overwhelming that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't be helped in any real sense.</v>

1824
01:46:04.151 --> 01:46:04.984
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if they're unmedicated </v>

1825
01:46:07.031 --> 01:46:10.150
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a drug problem,</v>

1826
01:46:10.420 --> 01:46:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Scott,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

1827
01:46:12.010 --> 01:46:12.843
<v Speaker 1>it's just a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a nightmare of insane complexity </v>

1828
01:46:16.571 --> 01:46:17.404
<v Speaker 1>because schizophrenia is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to deal with even even </v>

1829
01:46:21.970 --> 01:46:22.803
<v Speaker 1>with medication because the medication </v>
<v Speaker 1>that helps people who are schizophrenia </v>

1830
01:46:26.890 --> 01:46:30.550
<v Speaker 1>also tends to depress their positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion and decreased their motivation.</v>

1831
01:46:30.970 --> 01:46:34.030
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the medications are generally helpful</v>

1832
01:46:34.031 --> 01:46:34.864
<v Speaker 1>and the proper treatment guidelines if </v>
<v Speaker 1>your schizophrenia generally are stay </v>

1833
01:46:38.771 --> 01:46:43.771
<v Speaker 1>with your medication because despite the</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative consequences of the medication,</v>

1834
01:46:45.191 --> 01:46:46.024
<v Speaker 1>which aren't trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the consequences of not taking it or </v>

1835
01:46:48.870 --> 01:46:50.940
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a real Hobson's choice,</v>

1836
01:46:50.941 --> 01:46:53.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bit of hell in both directions.</v>

1837
01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:56.460
<v Speaker 1>But if you really want to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say</v>

1838
01:46:58.220 --> 01:46:59.053
<v Speaker 1>go have some contact with those people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and listen to them and learn what the </v>

1839
01:47:04.791 --> 01:47:05.624
<v Speaker 1>problems are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you could start seeing what might </v>

1840
01:47:06.981 --> 01:47:07.814
<v Speaker 1>be helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really complicated problem and </v>

1841
01:47:10.821 --> 01:47:11.654
<v Speaker 1>it's different than the problem of </v>
<v Speaker 1>helping people who don't want to be </v>

1842
01:47:13.521 --> 01:47:14.354
<v Speaker 1>helped because you have to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>who it is that that doesn't want to be </v>

1843
01:47:17.211 --> 01:47:18.044
<v Speaker 1>helped first and you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>assume that just because someone's </v>

1844
01:47:20.571 --> 01:47:22.160
<v Speaker 1>homeless that they don't want to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>helped.</v>

1845
01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:27.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean that doesn't mean that it's easy </v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out how to help them.</v>

1846
01:47:27.980 --> 01:47:28.813
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's helping people is a very difficult </v>

1847
01:47:31.131 --> 01:47:31.964
<v Speaker 1>business and it's a very dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>business too because you get tangled up </v>

1848
01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:39.880
<v Speaker 1>in ways that you wouldn't expect and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be an occupational hazard.</v>

1849
01:47:40.281 --> 01:47:41.330
<v Speaker 1>Let's put it that way.</v>

1850
01:47:43.950 --> 01:47:44.783
<v Speaker 1>How do I stop ruminating?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These thoughts are recurring and relate </v>

1851
01:47:47.521 --> 01:47:51.300
<v Speaker 1>to every and any embarrassing moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever had during my lifetime.</v>

1852
01:47:51.930 --> 01:47:54.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm a 76 year old woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1853
01:47:55.110 --> 01:47:55.943
<v Speaker 1>here's something you could try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Write down everything that you're </v>

1854
01:47:59.401 --> 01:48:02.280
<v Speaker 1>ruminating about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that seems counterproductive,</v>

1855
01:48:02.281 --> 01:48:03.114
<v Speaker 1>but like see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ruminations come up accidentally in </v>

1856
01:48:05.481 --> 01:48:07.710
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconsciously.</v>

1857
01:48:08.460 --> 01:48:12.240
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you write down everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're ruminating about your facing</v>

1858
01:48:12.241 --> 01:48:13.770
<v Speaker 1>them voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I would say,</v>

1859
01:48:13.771 --> 01:48:17.060
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>open up a journal or word document,</v>

1860
01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:17.933
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and write down every time you ruminate </v>

1861
01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:20.993
<v Speaker 1>about something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write it down and write down every </v>

1862
01:48:23.251 --> 01:48:26.730
<v Speaker 1>rumination you can remember exhaustedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write them all down.</v>

1863
01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:28.673
<v Speaker 1>That would be the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the second thing is standard </v>

1864
01:48:30.781 --> 01:48:32.820
<v Speaker 1>behavioral therapy practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second thing,</v>

1865
01:48:32.850 --> 01:48:34.580
<v Speaker 1>the next thing would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1866
01:48:36.330 --> 01:48:37.163
<v Speaker 1>write down why you think they happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you get a good causal account </v>

1867
01:48:42.030 --> 01:48:45.300
<v Speaker 1>and then write down well what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might've done about them then,</v>

1868
01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:46.553
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you could do about them in the </v>

1869
01:48:48.571 --> 01:48:49.404
<v Speaker 1>future to avoid that because it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter that something embarrassing </v>

1870
01:48:52.171 --> 01:48:53.004
<v Speaker 1>happened to you once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What matters is whether or not you're </v>

1871
01:48:56.461 --> 01:48:57.294
<v Speaker 1>likely to repeat it in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my suspicions are that even if you </v>

1872
01:49:00.241 --> 01:49:03.540
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could just start sampling.</v>

1873
01:49:05.190 --> 01:49:06.023
<v Speaker 1>Write down every ruminating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ruminating thought that you have </v>

1874
01:49:09.210 --> 01:49:14.210
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily and think about them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>detail and write them down in detail.</v>

1875
01:49:14.310 --> 01:49:19.170
<v Speaker 1>Get every little word down and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have that document.</v>

1876
01:49:19.171 --> 01:49:23.370
<v Speaker 1>And then when you have a thought and </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to ruminate on it,</v>

1877
01:49:23.900 --> 01:49:28.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then sit down later after the ruminating</v>

1878
01:49:28.291 --> 01:49:32.220
<v Speaker 1>thought goes away and bring it to mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily.</v>

1879
01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:33.773
<v Speaker 1>So every time you ever thought you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to have later practice having that </v>

1880
01:49:38.821 --> 01:49:39.654
<v Speaker 1>thought on purpose and try that for </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a month and see what happens </v>

1881
01:49:43.711 --> 01:49:48.711
<v Speaker 1>because it's often the case that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>start thinking about the thoughts,</v>

1882
01:49:49.481 --> 01:49:54.310
<v Speaker 1>you're ruminating on consciously and </v>
<v Speaker 1>confront them voluntarily,</v>

1883
01:49:54.670 --> 01:49:57.730
<v Speaker 1>that they will start to go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could try that.</v>

1884
01:49:57.850 --> 01:49:59.800
<v Speaker 1>You could try that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That should help.</v>

1885
01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:18.193
<v Speaker 1>What's the best method to retain what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you read and to be able to use it in </v>

1886
01:50:21.651 --> 01:50:23.660
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1887
01:50:23.690 --> 01:50:24.523
<v Speaker 1>well</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult really to retain </v>

1888
01:50:37.110 --> 01:50:42.110
<v Speaker 1>anything without recalling it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So look,</v>

1889
01:50:42.150 --> 01:50:43.710
<v Speaker 1>if you encounter something</v>

1890
01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:46.193
<v Speaker 1>and then you encounter it again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can usually recognize that you've </v>

1891
01:50:48.931 --> 01:50:51.630
<v Speaker 1>encountered it before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's recognition memory.</v>

1892
01:50:51.631 --> 01:50:54.450
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an important form of memory.</v>

1893
01:50:54.451 --> 01:50:55.284
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1894
01:50:55.680 --> 01:50:58.200
<v Speaker 1>it's the memory that's associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>familiarity,</v>

1895
01:50:58.201 --> 01:51:00.660
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the same as being able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>use something.</v>

1896
01:51:00.661 --> 01:51:01.494
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a rather shallow form of memory </v>

1897
01:51:03.211 --> 01:51:07.530
<v Speaker 1>even though it's necessary in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to use something.</v>

1898
01:51:08.940 --> 01:51:09.773
<v Speaker 1>You have to recall it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is also very useful hint for </v>

1899
01:51:12.481 --> 01:51:13.314
<v Speaker 1>studying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're studying and you have to </v>

1900
01:51:14.731 --> 01:51:19.410
<v Speaker 1>remember what you want to do is study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you want to write down what you</v>

1901
01:51:19.411 --> 01:51:22.230
<v Speaker 1>just learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you read the paragraph,</v>

1902
01:51:22.620 --> 01:51:23.453
<v Speaker 1>he closed the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you write down what you remember or </v>

1903
01:51:25.681 --> 01:51:26.514
<v Speaker 1>you read a chapter and you close the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book and you write down what you </v>

1904
01:51:29.371 --> 01:51:32.520
<v Speaker 1>remembered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or at least you sit there and you try to</v>

1905
01:51:32.521 --> 01:51:37.500
<v Speaker 1>remember because the way you remember is</v>
<v Speaker 1>by practicing remembering.</v>

1906
01:51:38.430 --> 01:51:41.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're reading and you want to use</v>

1907
01:51:41.041 --> 01:51:45.120
<v Speaker 1>it in conversation and you have to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what you read,</v>

1908
01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:50.300
<v Speaker 1>you have to put it in your own words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's often helpful to close the book and</v>

1909
01:51:50.431 --> 01:51:51.264
<v Speaker 1>write it down or to associate it with </v>
<v Speaker 1>some problem that you're currently </v>

1910
01:51:56.311 --> 01:51:57.144
<v Speaker 1>trying to solve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to take the knowledge and </v>

1911
01:51:58.441 --> 01:51:59.274
<v Speaker 1>make it your own and then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that alters the structure </v>

1912
01:52:03.181 --> 01:52:06.810
<v Speaker 1>through which you look at the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that changes the way that you think,</v>

1913
01:52:06.811 --> 01:52:07.644
<v Speaker 1>so that when you have a conversation the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next time that you're going to have the </v>

1914
01:52:09.931 --> 01:52:13.860
<v Speaker 1>conversation in a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So merely reading isn't enough.</v>

1915
01:52:13.861 --> 01:52:14.694
<v Speaker 1>You have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to read and think and recall </v>

1916
01:52:18.570 --> 01:52:19.403
<v Speaker 1>and it's the act of recalling that </v>
<v Speaker 1>produces the remembering and it's that </v>

1917
01:52:22.651 --> 01:52:26.430
<v Speaker 1>act of remembering that puts that </v>
<v Speaker 1>material at hand for you.</v>

1918
01:52:27.330 --> 01:52:32.330
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1919
01:52:33.641 --> 01:52:35.440
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just about done here.</v>

1920
01:52:35.441 --> 01:52:36.274
<v Speaker 1>It's 1135,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I've gone for 19 minutes and I hear </v>

1921
01:52:38.081 --> 01:52:41.410
<v Speaker 1>people rattling room upstairs and I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fly dessert today.</v>

1922
01:52:41.411 --> 01:52:44.290
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm going to start out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stop.</v>

1923
01:52:44.790 --> 01:52:45.623
<v Speaker 1>I'm here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll find one more question and </v>

1924
01:52:47.631 --> 01:52:48.500
<v Speaker 1>answer it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1925
01:52:48.980 --> 01:52:49.813
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1926
01:52:54.390 --> 01:52:57.780
<v Speaker 1>I just found out I'm having a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congratulations.</v>

1927
01:52:57.960 --> 01:52:58.793
<v Speaker 1>What can I do to raise her to think for </v>
<v Speaker 1>herself and not fall into the modes of </v>

1928
01:53:02.491 --> 01:53:05.490
<v Speaker 1>thinking proposed by popular culture?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1929
01:53:07.370 --> 01:53:10.250
<v Speaker 1>you can let her think for herself when </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's a kid.</v>

1930
01:53:10.730 --> 01:53:11.563
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is so that she practices </v>

1931
01:53:13.041 --> 01:53:14.570
<v Speaker 1>doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1932
01:53:14.780 --> 01:53:17.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that means two</v>

1933
01:53:19.300 --> 01:53:22.780
<v Speaker 1>consciously encourage as much autonomy </v>
<v Speaker 1>as possible.</v>

1934
01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:26.110
<v Speaker 1>So how do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1935
01:53:26.111 --> 01:53:26.944
<v Speaker 1>let's say she's a little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's three and she started to get </v>

1936
01:53:29.141 --> 01:53:29.974
<v Speaker 1>interested in clothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you lay clothing out of the bed and </v>

1937
01:53:31.781 --> 01:53:33.970
<v Speaker 1>you say what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can wear this or you can wear this.</v>

1938
01:53:34.030 --> 01:53:36.470
<v Speaker 1>You let her make autonomous decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1939
01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:37.353
<v Speaker 1>with kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to let them choose from </v>

1940
01:53:40.661 --> 01:53:43.420
<v Speaker 1>an infinite menu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to give them a constraint menu.</v>

1941
01:53:43.421 --> 01:53:44.254
<v Speaker 1>But what you want to do with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter is allow her to make as many </v>

1942
01:53:48.851 --> 01:53:52.720
<v Speaker 1>decisions as she can possibly make as </v>
<v Speaker 1>early as possible.</v>

1943
01:53:53.490 --> 01:53:54.323
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that doesn't mean the children </v>

1944
01:53:55.691 --> 01:53:59.080
<v Speaker 1>always know what's best for themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>or any nonsense like that.</v>

1945
01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:04.440
<v Speaker 1>It just means that you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>encourage her autonomy to every,</v>

1946
01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:07.153
<v Speaker 1>in every</v>

1947
01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:09.593
<v Speaker 1>measure that you can manage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means you're going to have to </v>

1948
01:54:11.221 --> 01:54:15.270
<v Speaker 1>be brave and allow her to subject </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to a certain number of risks.</v>

1949
01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:17.940
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1950
01:54:17.970 --> 01:54:22.970
<v Speaker 1>you raise her to think for herself by </v>
<v Speaker 1>letting her think for herself.</v>

1951
01:54:24.030 --> 01:54:26.460
<v Speaker 1>And that can start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That can start quite early.</v>

1952
01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:28.913
<v Speaker 1>I would say when she's a teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's going to fall into the modes of </v>

1953
01:54:31.531 --> 01:54:32.364
<v Speaker 1>thinking proposed by popular culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's part of being </v>

1954
01:54:34.651 --> 01:54:35.484
<v Speaker 1>enculturated socialized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's virtually inevitable and it's even </v>

1955
01:54:38.911 --> 01:54:42.020
<v Speaker 1>somewhat desirable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you hope is that you've.</v>

1956
01:54:43.170 --> 01:54:44.003
<v Speaker 1>You've encouraged the capacity for </v>
<v Speaker 1>autonomous thinking to a sufficient </v>

1957
01:54:48.811 --> 01:54:49.644
<v Speaker 1>degree that it's likely to integrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that more intense teenage </v>

1958
01:54:53.731 --> 01:54:54.564
<v Speaker 1>socialization and then reemerge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get someone who comes out the </v>

1959
01:54:57.931 --> 01:55:02.310
<v Speaker 1>other side as an autonomous individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that works with boys and girls.</v>

1960
01:55:02.311 --> 01:55:04.020
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1961
01:55:04.021 --> 01:55:05.700
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you do.</v>

1962
01:55:05.701 --> 01:55:09.080
<v Speaker 1>What Japan did in Pinocchio is the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing you decided is,</v>

1963
01:55:09.330 --> 01:55:10.640
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to raise a puppet.</v>

1964
01:55:12.270 --> 01:55:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Don't you want to raise an autonomous </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

1965
01:55:14.820 --> 01:55:18.390
<v Speaker 1>and and then you think through what does</v>
<v Speaker 1>it mean to be an autonomous person?</v>

1966
01:55:18.391 --> 01:55:20.310
<v Speaker 1>What sort of person do you want your </v>
<v Speaker 1>child to be?</v>

1967
01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:21.173
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what sort of person do you want to </v>

1968
01:55:22.771 --> 01:55:26.790
<v Speaker 1>encourage your child to be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then having,</v>

1969
01:55:26.970 --> 01:55:29.790
<v Speaker 1>having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having established that vision in mind,</v>

1970
01:55:29.791 --> 01:55:30.624
<v Speaker 1>that's going to guide your choices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least you're making the right </v>

1971
01:55:33.361 --> 01:55:34.194
<v Speaker 1>choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want someone who's dependent </v>

1972
01:55:35.701 --> 01:55:40.701
<v Speaker 1>and whiny and clingy and and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more frightened than they need to be</v>

1973
01:55:40.770 --> 01:55:41.603
<v Speaker 1>and martyr martyr like and vengeful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>malicious and manipulative and </v>

1974
01:55:47.250 --> 01:55:49.320
<v Speaker 1>mendacious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of those states.</v>

1975
01:55:49.321 --> 01:55:50.154
<v Speaker 1>You want someone who can make their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgements and you can ask kids what </v>

1976
01:55:55.771 --> 01:55:59.400
<v Speaker 1>they think pretty damn early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have to be careful and not push</v>

1977
01:55:59.401 --> 01:56:01.470
<v Speaker 1>them beyond their capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1978
01:56:03.180 --> 01:56:04.013
<v Speaker 1>if you know your child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will be able to see what level of </v>

1979
01:56:06.061 --> 01:56:11.061
<v Speaker 1>decision making they're capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>engaging in and then you would encourage</v>

1980
01:56:11.221 --> 01:56:15.210
<v Speaker 1>them to mature as rapidly as they can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1981
01:56:15.211 --> 01:56:16.044
<v Speaker 1>and that also means that you have to not</v>
<v Speaker 1>allow yourself to fall too in love with </v>

1982
01:56:21.571 --> 01:56:22.404
<v Speaker 1>a dependent and needy creature that your</v>
<v Speaker 1>infant will be to fulfill your own </v>

1983
01:56:28.021 --> 01:56:28.854
<v Speaker 1>emotional needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to detach and encouraged to </v>

1984
01:56:32.191 --> 01:56:35.550
<v Speaker 1>mature as rapidly and as comprehensively</v>
<v Speaker 1>as possible.</v>

1985
01:56:35.670 --> 01:56:37.890
<v Speaker 1>And that will work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1986
01:56:38.130 --> 01:56:41.880
<v Speaker 1>and some of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of that is</v>

1987
01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:46.770
<v Speaker 1>negotiation with your child and find out</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they think.</v>

1988
01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:48.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about this?</v>

1989
01:56:49.530 --> 01:56:51.660
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about who should do </v>
<v Speaker 1>the work in the house?</v>

1990
01:56:51.661 --> 01:56:54.810
<v Speaker 1>How should we split it up like they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be engaged in the decision making?</v>

1991
01:56:54.811 --> 01:56:59.811
<v Speaker 1>Process is a very early age and and part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>

1992
01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:02.393
<v Speaker 1>that encouragement is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflected in your implicit attitudes </v>

1993
01:57:06.980 --> 01:57:11.980
<v Speaker 1>that the child is a real person who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of imposing their will</v>

1994
01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:15.953
<v Speaker 1>in a realistic sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one in the world on the world and doing </v>

1995
01:57:19.621 --> 01:57:24.621
<v Speaker 1>that in a competent and</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

1996
01:57:25.710 --> 01:57:30.710
<v Speaker 1>competent and confident manner so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least the beginning is the desire</v>

1997
01:57:31.501 --> 01:57:35.010
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to raise them confident,</v>

1998
01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:37.650
<v Speaker 1>autonomous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>courageous,</v>

1999
01:57:37.740 --> 01:57:38.573
<v Speaker 1>truthful person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you reward them when they're </v>

2000
01:57:41.551 --> 01:57:45.330
<v Speaker 1>like that and you notice it and you tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>them good work.</v>

2001
01:57:45.660 --> 01:57:46.493
<v Speaker 1>You did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2002
01:57:46.980 --> 01:57:47.813
<v Speaker 1>Keep it up.</v>

2003
01:57:47.880 --> 01:57:50.880
<v Speaker 1>That's the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you tell them why.</v>

2004
01:57:50.940 --> 01:57:53.130
<v Speaker 1>What they did was right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2005
01:57:53.131 --> 01:57:56.550
<v Speaker 1>in a detailed way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's very powerful.</v>

2006
01:57:56.551 --> 01:57:59.730
<v Speaker 1>You wait and you look and you wait for </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you want to have happened</v>

2007
01:57:59.731 --> 01:58:00.690
<v Speaker 1>and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2008
01:58:00.740 --> 01:58:03.210
<v Speaker 1>we'd like to see a lot more of that good</v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

2009
01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:07.620
<v Speaker 1>You do that with yourself and with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>partner to very powerful technique.</v>

2010
01:58:08.220 --> 01:58:11.430
<v Speaker 1>All right everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say goodbye.</v>

2011
01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:12.893
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully I'll do another one of these </v>

2012
01:58:14.431 --> 01:58:15.264
<v Speaker 1>in February,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I'm not certain maybe at the </v>

2013
01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:19.500
<v Speaker 1>end of January I have a couple of days </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

2014
01:58:19.501 --> 01:58:23.820

<v Speaker 1>and that's going to be very busy.</v>

2015
01:58:24.120 --> 01:58:26.340
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe I can do I like doing this.</v>

2016
01:58:26.341 --> 01:58:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I can do another one in January </v>
<v Speaker 1>near the end.</v>

2017
01:58:29.420 --> 01:58:31.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
