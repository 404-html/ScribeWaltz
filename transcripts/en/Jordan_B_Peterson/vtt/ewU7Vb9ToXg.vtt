1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.023
<v Speaker 2>so okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we've talked a little bit about </v>

3
00:00:14.871 --> 00:00:19.630
<v Speaker 2>motivation last time or quite a bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>about motivation and what I,</v>

4
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.670
<v Speaker 2>I told you that I was basically teach </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

5
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.533
<v Speaker 2>teaching you a personality neuroscience </v>
<v Speaker 2>approach to personality and part of the </v>

6
00:00:27.951 --> 00:00:28.784
<v Speaker 2>reason that I have to go into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>biology to give you is to give you the </v>

7
00:00:32.451 --> 00:00:35.030
<v Speaker 2>kind of foundation that you need in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to understand.</v>

8
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.080
<v Speaker 2>I would say what's essentially the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cutting edge in personality research.</v>

9
00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:43.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know that what we're going,</v>

10
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.113
<v Speaker 2>what we covered last lecture and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to cover today are </v>

11
00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:47.504
<v Speaker 2>relatively complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you get them right then you're </v>

12
00:00:49.731 --> 00:00:51.920
<v Speaker 2>right at the forefront of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

13
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.630
<v Speaker 2>of our ideas about brain function and </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion and about personality.</v>

14
00:00:56.631 --> 00:00:57.464
<v Speaker 2>So you get all that at the same time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>today you'll get a little bit of </v>

15
00:00:59.691 --> 00:01:01.310
<v Speaker 2>learning theory thrown in as well.</v>

16
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.143
<v Speaker 2>So learning learning theory is basically</v>
<v Speaker 2>what used to be what's alternatively </v>

17
00:01:06.591 --> 00:01:08.990
<v Speaker 2>described as behaviorism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't.</v>

18
00:01:08.991 --> 00:01:11.210
<v Speaker 2>I used to teach behavior is I'm in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>class,</v>

19
00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:15.080
<v Speaker 2>but I've subsumed it underneath the </v>
<v Speaker 2>biology because the old.</v>

20
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.300
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the old behavior </v>
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions,</v>

21
00:01:17.301 --> 00:01:20.780
<v Speaker 2>although they were extremely useful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not right,</v>

22
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.280
<v Speaker 2>which is exactly what you'd expect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were formulated in the 19 fifties,</v>

23
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.363
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's actually the sign of the </v>

24
00:01:27.891 --> 00:01:31.250
<v Speaker 2>progress of science that theories that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are 60 years old or no longer.</v>

25
00:01:31.251 --> 00:01:32.810
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

26
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.833
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll also cover a little bit of </v>

27
00:01:36.051 --> 00:01:38.330
<v Speaker 2>behavioral theory today too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

28
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:39.523
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the hypothesis we've been working on </v>

29
00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:43.220
<v Speaker 2>so far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or we'll call it the working theory,</v>

30
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.503
<v Speaker 2>is that motivations set goals or more </v>
<v Speaker 2>accurately that they define as a </v>

31
00:01:49.131 --> 00:01:49.964
<v Speaker 2>conceptual space within which you </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceive the world and within which you </v>

32
00:01:53.271 --> 00:01:54.104
<v Speaker 2>act toward some goal and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or to some endpoint and the endpoint in </v>

33
00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:01.520
<v Speaker 2>some sense as specified by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivational system.</v>

34
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.370
<v Speaker 2>It's a hypothalamic system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are often,</v>

35
00:02:04.371 --> 00:02:08.030
<v Speaker 2>but not always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not only is the goal specified,</v>

36
00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:11.570
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the underlying motivational systems also</v>

37
00:02:11.571 --> 00:02:12.404
<v Speaker 2>tune your perception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're only looking at the things </v>

38
00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:17.120
<v Speaker 2>that you know to be relevant to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pursuit of that goal.</v>

39
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.100
<v Speaker 2>And they also either disinhibit or </v>
<v Speaker 2>activate the behavioral schemes that you</v>

40
00:02:22.101 --> 00:02:27.100
<v Speaker 2>would normally use to pursue the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes those are the,</v>

41
00:02:27.101 --> 00:02:28.340
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the motor schemes,</v>

42
00:02:28.341 --> 00:02:30.950
<v Speaker 2>because that would be more accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you think about behavior,</v>

43
00:02:30.951 --> 00:02:32.930
<v Speaker 2>you tend to think about voluntary </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>

44
00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:37.931
<v Speaker 2>but a motivational state will disinhibit</v>
<v Speaker 2>or activate depending on the situation,</v>

45
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.540
<v Speaker 2>autonomic responses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

46
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.523
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were food deprived and you </v>

47
00:02:44.571 --> 00:02:45.404
<v Speaker 2>start to think about food and start to </v>
<v Speaker 2>organize your behavior towards food as </v>

48
00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:50.840
<v Speaker 2>an end and to perceive the world that </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

49
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.823
<v Speaker 2>your body also prepares for food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the motivational state is an all </v>

50
00:02:56.091 --> 00:02:58.550
<v Speaker 2>encompassing psychophysiological </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomena.</v>

51
00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:59.383
<v Speaker 2>It's not as simple as change behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was an early be behavioral theory </v>

52
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 2>or as simple as something that's merely </v>
<v Speaker 2>setting a goal.</v>

53
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:07.594
<v Speaker 2>It's much more complicated than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's useful to think about as we've </v>

54
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:14.770
<v Speaker 2>already talked about with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychodynamic theory.</v>

55
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 2>It's useful to think about a motivated </v>
<v Speaker 2>state as a micro personality.</v>

56
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 2>It's got one aim in mind fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's not particularly sophisticated,</v>

57
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 2>but it has all the other elements of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality.</v>

58
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.483
<v Speaker 2>So now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so motivation establishes the framework </v>

59
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:33.580
<v Speaker 2>within which goals are pursued and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>goal itself.</v>

60
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:34.563
<v Speaker 2>And then roughly speaking emotions or at</v>
<v Speaker 2>least many of the emotions track </v>

61
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:40.654
<v Speaker 2>progress towards goals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so they kind of tell you whether </v>

62
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:43.624
<v Speaker 2>you're on the right track or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a reasonable way of </v>

63
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.273
<v Speaker 2>distinguishing them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though there is no single </v>

64
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:52.780
<v Speaker 2>motivation system or a single emotion </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

65
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.560
<v Speaker 2>There's some basic motivations.</v>

66
00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are the sorts of things that Freud</v>

67
00:03:59.141 --> 00:04:01.520
<v Speaker 2>would have associated fundamentally with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ed.</v>

68
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.913
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he thought of there's this </v>

69
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.263
<v Speaker 2>primordial and that's exactly right </v>
<v Speaker 2>because pretty much all of these </v>

70
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:07.803
<v Speaker 2>motivational systems we share certainly </v>
<v Speaker 2>with other people also with other </v>

71
00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:15.550
<v Speaker 2>mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then of course with animals that are</v>

72
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.250
<v Speaker 2>farther down the evolutionary chain than</v>
<v Speaker 2>mammals.</v>

73
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.620
<v Speaker 2>So some of these systems are </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily old.</v>

74
00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:21.613
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of them are extraordinarily old </v>

75
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.210
<v Speaker 2>hunger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of food deprivation,</v>

76
00:04:25.211 --> 00:04:26.044
<v Speaker 2>obviously thirst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously people are very dependent on </v>

77
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.870
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pain.</v>

78
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.790
<v Speaker 2>Pain's complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

79
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.350
<v Speaker 2>there's physical pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's,</v>

80
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.830
<v Speaker 2>it's mental equivalents and the mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>equivalent of pain,</v>

81
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.610
<v Speaker 2>our grief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disappointment,</v>

82
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.370
<v Speaker 2>frustration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking.</v>

83
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.473
<v Speaker 2>And so you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you can think about that as you </v>

84
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:51.573
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you saw the picture of the nervous </v>

85
00:04:52.361 --> 00:04:53.194
<v Speaker 2>system that I showed you last time with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the branches going up into the brain </v>

86
00:04:56.111 --> 00:04:56.944
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with all the branches are the roots </v>

87
00:04:58.451 --> 00:04:59.800
<v Speaker 2>say going down into the body.</v>

88
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.633
<v Speaker 2>So we discussed the central nervous </v>
<v Speaker 2>system as a sort of all encompassing </v>

89
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.893
<v Speaker 2>system distributed throughout the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that part of that network </v>

90
00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:13.510
<v Speaker 2>throughout your body is associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>pain reception and that would be roughly</v>

91
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:14.703
<v Speaker 2>equivalent to systems registering levels</v>
<v Speaker 2>of input that are high enough to </v>

92
00:05:19.421 --> 00:05:20.254
<v Speaker 2>potentially damage them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where pain seeps seems to come </v>

93
00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:25.300
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that different pieces of that can be</v>

94
00:05:25.301 --> 00:05:29.380
<v Speaker 2>activated at different times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if it's psychological pain,</v>

95
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.550
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grief,</v>

96
00:05:30.551 --> 00:05:31.384
<v Speaker 2>frustration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disappointment seems to fall into that </v>

97
00:05:33.071 --> 00:05:35.800
<v Speaker 2>category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A loneliness as another one.</v>

98
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.033
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then maybe it's primarily the cortical </v>

99
00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:44.050
<v Speaker 2>circuitry for pain that's activated in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although people who are depressed,</v>

100
00:05:44.051 --> 00:05:44.884
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or who are grieving often have somatic </v>

101
00:05:46.811 --> 00:05:47.644
<v Speaker 2>pain as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And depression really looks like it's a </v>

102
00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:51.320
<v Speaker 2>pain state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

103
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.293
<v Speaker 2>we know loneliness is because if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>take like little chicks or little </v>

104
00:05:55.301 --> 00:05:59.410
<v Speaker 2>kittens and you make them lonesome and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll cry which is a or,</v>

105
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.720
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or peep if their chicks and you can stop</v>

106
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:03.554
<v Speaker 2>them from doing that by using opiates </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not because it stops them from </v>

107
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:10.520
<v Speaker 2>vocalizing because that would be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility.</v>

108
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.130
<v Speaker 2>Just get them so stoned on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

109
00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.450
<v Speaker 2>morphine that they can't peep and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

110
00:06:14.451 --> 00:06:15.284
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're now they're not lonesome </v>

111
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.240
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

112
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.403
<v Speaker 2>the experiments have been done carefully</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to factor out the effect of the </v>

113
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:23.630
<v Speaker 2>opiates on the vocalization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

114
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:24.613
<v Speaker 2>and that's also led to some suspicion </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people who have have had a history </v>

115
00:06:31.131 --> 00:06:31.964
<v Speaker 2>of extraordinarily painful personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships might be those who are </v>

116
00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:39.620
<v Speaker 2>more prone to opiate use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so opiates analgesics are,</v>

117
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.180
<v Speaker 2>they basically dampen out pain and </v>
<v Speaker 2>frustration and disappointment and grief</v>

118
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.163
<v Speaker 2>and loneliness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's an anger and aggression </v>

119
00:06:47.721 --> 00:06:49.280
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's complicated.</v>

120
00:06:49.281 --> 00:06:51.890
<v Speaker 2>There's probably two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is defensive aggression,</v>

121
00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:55.850
<v Speaker 2>that's probably more associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroticism technically.</v>

122
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.070
<v Speaker 2>The other is probably predatory </v>
<v Speaker 2>aggression.</v>

123
00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:59.800
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

124
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.680
<v Speaker 2>human beings are definitely predators </v>
<v Speaker 2>square meters and you know,</v>

125
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our closest relatives,</v>

126
00:07:05.181 --> 00:07:06.530
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

127
00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:07.850
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty good hunters.</v>

128
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:09.613
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>

129
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:10.663
<v Speaker 2>they'll pack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gathered together and packs and bring </v>

130
00:07:12.471 --> 00:07:14.360
<v Speaker 2>down 30 lb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>call us monkeys,</v>

131
00:07:14.361 --> 00:07:16.700
<v Speaker 2>and the meat is very popular among the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chimps.</v>

132
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.820
<v Speaker 2>And so predatory aggression seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>a separate circuit.</v>

133
00:07:19.821 --> 00:07:24.680
<v Speaker 2>And as we'll discuss further along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the predatory aggression circuit</v>

134
00:07:24.681 --> 00:07:29.330
<v Speaker 2>and the maternal solicitude circuit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's also a care circuit have</v>

135
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.930
<v Speaker 2>evolved to be at opposite ends of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same distribution.</v>

136
00:07:32.931 --> 00:07:35.960
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the agreeableness </v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution in the big five.</v>

137
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.200
<v Speaker 2>So in one day and there's maternal </v>
<v Speaker 2>solicitude and the other end,</v>

138
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:43.070
<v Speaker 2>there's predatory aggression and you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine how those things have to inhibit</v>

139
00:07:43.071 --> 00:07:44.510
<v Speaker 2>one another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

140
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.690
<v Speaker 2>because well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

141
00:07:47.691 --> 00:07:50.000
<v Speaker 2>with many mammals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bears for example,</v>

142
00:07:50.001 --> 00:07:50.834
<v Speaker 2>the males are so predatory that you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to keep them away from the cubs because </v>

143
00:07:53.721 --> 00:07:55.550
<v Speaker 2>they'll kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Human beings,</v>

144
00:07:55.551 --> 00:07:59.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's some aggression towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>

145
00:07:59.301 --> 00:08:01.880
<v Speaker 2>especially if the children aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological relatives.</v>

146
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.060
<v Speaker 2>But men are pretty caring for male </v>
<v Speaker 2>mammals.</v>

147
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:08.630
<v Speaker 2>And women are actually quite predatory </v>
<v Speaker 2>for male mammals.</v>

148
00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:09.464
<v Speaker 2>So thermal regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your hypothalamus takes care of whether </v>

149
00:08:12.741 --> 00:08:15.320
<v Speaker 2>you're hot or cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>panic and escape,</v>

150
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:16.613
<v Speaker 2>that those are circuits that also seemed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be associated with pain </v>

151
00:08:19.641 --> 00:08:20.474
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although threat can maybe trigger them </v>

152
00:08:22.311 --> 00:08:23.144
<v Speaker 2>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the panic escape system doesn't </v>

153
00:08:25.221 --> 00:08:29.150
<v Speaker 2>exactly seem to be the same system as </v>
<v Speaker 2>the anxiety and fear system.</v>

154
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.360
<v Speaker 2>Even though they sound they sound </v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly equivalent,</v>

155
00:08:32.361 --> 00:08:33.194
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might think of panic as just the </v>

156
00:08:34.461 --> 00:08:38.600
<v Speaker 2>extreme level of fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think fear can trigger panic,</v>

157
00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:42.200
<v Speaker 2>but panic seems to be a more primordial </v>
<v Speaker 2>circuit and if you're panicking,</v>

158
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:47.210
<v Speaker 2>there's an immense impetus to to escape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a difference.</v>

159
00:08:47.631 --> 00:08:50.660
<v Speaker 2>Circuit affiliation to care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We covered sexual desire,</v>

160
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.943
<v Speaker 2>exploration and play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both of those seem to be separate </v>

161
00:08:54.141 --> 00:08:54.974
<v Speaker 2>circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Jaak Jaak Panksepp actually wrote a </v>

162
00:08:57.301 --> 00:08:59.490
<v Speaker 2>great book called affective </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroscience.</v>

163
00:08:59.491 --> 00:09:02.610
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if any of you are interested in like the</v>

164
00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:05.070
<v Speaker 2>psychobiology of behavior and </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivation,</v>

165
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:05.963
<v Speaker 2>Jaak Panksepp book is one of the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have a paper by him in in our </v>

166
00:09:09.871 --> 00:09:11.940
<v Speaker 2>collection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's a very smart guy.</v>

167
00:09:11.941 --> 00:09:16.200
<v Speaker 2>He wrote this book called affective </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroscience and it's actually given its</v>

168
00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:18.660
<v Speaker 2>title and the relative complexity of </v>
<v Speaker 2>its.</v>

169
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.570
<v Speaker 2>Of its thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually quite readable even though</v>

170
00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:25.060
<v Speaker 2>it's a text is a little more personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>than your typical text might be.</v>

171
00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:30.060
<v Speaker 2>And Panksepp is also very interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a psychodynamic and personality idea.</v>

172
00:09:30.401 --> 00:09:33.390
<v Speaker 2>So he's a very broad thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're interested in,</v>

173
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:34.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

174
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:35.753
<v Speaker 2>an approach to psychology that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>crosses the threshold from personality </v>

175
00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:43.070
<v Speaker 2>into emotion in biology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Panksepp as well as grave.</v>

176
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.460
<v Speaker 2>There's a great paper that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading.</v>

177
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.040
<v Speaker 2>Panksepp's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very good source.</v>

178
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:47.933
<v Speaker 2>He's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he discovered the play circuit for </v>

179
00:09:51.301 --> 00:09:52.560
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

180
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:58.790
<v Speaker 2>and he also discovered that rats laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you take a rat,</v>

181
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.473
<v Speaker 2>it laughs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't hear it though because it </v>

182
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:02.903
<v Speaker 2>laughs ultrasonically like a bat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you record the rat giggling and </v>

183
00:10:07.561 --> 00:10:11.730
<v Speaker 2>then slow down the tape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can tell that the rat laughs.</v>

184
00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:12.893
<v Speaker 2>Rats need to play in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most mammals need to play in order to </v>

185
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.640
<v Speaker 2>socialize them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

186
00:10:17.641 --> 00:10:20.160
<v Speaker 2>so one of the things you can think about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this when your parents do,</v>

187
00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:20.994
<v Speaker 2>and this is probably especially relevant</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the man because one of the things </v>

188
00:10:23.371 --> 00:10:26.580
<v Speaker 2>you might ask is what role do men play </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the socialization of children?</v>

189
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:27.413
<v Speaker 2>And one thing that men really do seem to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do with kids is to engage in rough and </v>

190
00:10:30.691 --> 00:10:31.524
<v Speaker 2>tumble play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially once they're a little older </v>

191
00:10:33.181 --> 00:10:36.690
<v Speaker 2>than to say two to five or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And kids love that.</v>

192
00:10:36.691 --> 00:10:40.840
<v Speaker 2>They absolutely love rough and tumble </v>
<v Speaker 2>play gets them so excited that you know,</v>

193
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:41.693
<v Speaker 2>they get out of control fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but rough and tumble play is an </v>

194
00:10:44.371 --> 00:10:45.204
<v Speaker 2>excellent mode of socialization because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it teaches the child that the </v>

195
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:53.250
<v Speaker 2>distinction between the aggression and </v>
<v Speaker 2>too much aggression.</v>

196
00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.113
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're wrestling with the </v>

197
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.673
<v Speaker 2>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kid has to keep their behavioral </v>

198
00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:02.100
<v Speaker 2>output under a fair degree of control to</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep the game going,</v>

199
00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.113
<v Speaker 2>to make it rough enough to be exciting </v>
<v Speaker 2>but not so rough that they get hurt or </v>

200
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:06.703
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they stick their thumb in their </v>

201
00:11:07.291 --> 00:11:11.600
<v Speaker 2>dad's I or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can think of that from a phd and</v>

202
00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:12.453
<v Speaker 2>sense too because it's a game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but imagine that if you're trying to </v>

203
00:11:15.001 --> 00:11:17.970
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to configure yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>around other people,</v>

204
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:21.210
<v Speaker 2>if you haven't had that rough and tumble</v>
<v Speaker 2>play,</v>

205
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.970
<v Speaker 2>you don't really know where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>boundaries of your body are,</v>

206
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:24.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

207
00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:25.713
<v Speaker 2>and you don't know how much you can take</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how much you can be stretched and </v>

208
00:11:28.441 --> 00:11:29.274
<v Speaker 2>how much you can be thrown around and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when something actually hurts rather </v>

209
00:11:33.001 --> 00:11:33.930
<v Speaker 2>than this frightening.</v>

210
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:36.720
<v Speaker 2>And so all of that intense sort of play </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

211
00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:37.913
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

212
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.730
<v Speaker 2>that boys in particular are likely to </v>
<v Speaker 2>engage it.</v>

213
00:11:40.731 --> 00:11:41.910
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the girls also like,</v>

214
00:11:41.911 --> 00:11:42.744
<v Speaker 2>it</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to be very useful for teaching </v>

215
00:11:45.541 --> 00:11:49.280
<v Speaker 2>children about how to engage with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world but,</v>

216
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:50.203
<v Speaker 2>and with other people in a physical way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the physiological for </v>

217
00:11:53.831 --> 00:11:57.460
<v Speaker 2>higher order socialization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's very useful.</v>

218
00:11:57.461 --> 00:11:57.761
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

219
00:11:57.761 --> 00:11:58.594
<v Speaker 2>I've always often noted that children </v>
<v Speaker 2>who haven't had the opportunity to </v>

220
00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:04.030
<v Speaker 2>engage in physical play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of awkward.</v>

221
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:04.820
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

222
00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:05.653
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not seated well in their body </v>

223
00:12:07.391 --> 00:12:09.610
<v Speaker 2>and it's like they're kind of vague </v>
<v Speaker 2>physically.</v>

224
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.730
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the ones who've been twisted </v>
<v Speaker 2>around in Banton,</v>

225
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.370
<v Speaker 2>thrown up in the air and wrestled in </v>
<v Speaker 2>general,</v>

226
00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:16.343
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot more conscious of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>limits and their abilities and their </v>

227
00:12:19.721 --> 00:12:24.721
<v Speaker 2>body and they're also much more able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>invite other kids to play.</v>

228
00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.100
<v Speaker 2>You can think about this with regards to</v>
<v Speaker 2>dogs.</v>

229
00:12:27.101 --> 00:12:29.290
<v Speaker 2>You know if you have a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the dog,</v>

230
00:12:29.291 --> 00:12:31.120
<v Speaker 2>you can tell when the dog wants to play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

231
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.710
<v Speaker 2>What does the dog do?</v>

232
00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jumps around and it puts his rear end in</v>

233
00:12:38.561 --> 00:12:41.200
<v Speaker 2>the air often and its head down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks up,</v>

234
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.333
<v Speaker 2>which is a little bit submissive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit friendly and it wags its </v>

235
00:12:45.221 --> 00:12:46.054
<v Speaker 2>tail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might bark and it moves back and </v>

236
00:12:47.051 --> 00:12:49.810
<v Speaker 2>forth and like little kids that want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>play do well.</v>

237
00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.670
<v Speaker 2>They don't put their tails in the air </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>

238
00:12:51.671 --> 00:12:52.780
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

239
00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:56.110
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they engage in play invitation behaviors</v>

240
00:12:56.111 --> 00:12:56.944
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

241
00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:58.083
<v Speaker 2>little bit of teasing sometimes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to get some play </v>

242
00:13:00.551 --> 00:13:04.360
<v Speaker 2>initiated on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also practice for later dominance.</v>

243
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:09.400
<v Speaker 2>When chimps play the males in particular</v>
<v Speaker 2>as they approach adolescence,</v>

244
00:13:09.401 --> 00:13:11.800
<v Speaker 2>the play behavior because then they'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>throw sticks.</v>

245
00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.910
<v Speaker 2>At the old chimps who were laying down </v>
<v Speaker 2>and sleeping or come up and poke them or</v>

246
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.073
<v Speaker 2>tease them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then as they become more and more </v>

247
00:13:19.931 --> 00:13:22.890
<v Speaker 2>powerful and more and more adolescence </v>
<v Speaker 2>and into adulthood,</v>

248
00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:23.733
<v Speaker 2>did not play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will become full blown dominance </v>

249
00:13:25.241 --> 00:13:26.074
<v Speaker 2>challenges as you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no doubt noticed if you were in junior </v>

250
00:13:29.021 --> 00:13:32.080
<v Speaker 2>high school because that's exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens to teachers.</v>

251
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.730
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The little elementary school kids,</v>

252
00:13:33.731 --> 00:13:35.560
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of cute when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>misbehave.</v>

253
00:13:35.561 --> 00:13:39.190
<v Speaker 2>They're sort of playful book by the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>grade eight or grade nine comes around.</v>

254
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:40.383
<v Speaker 2>The pushing on the teacher is a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>harder and so you can see how play </v>

255
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.880
<v Speaker 2>shades into dominance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just butte,</v>

256
00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:50.380
<v Speaker 2>but it is a separate circuit exploration</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a separate circuit and one of the</v>

257
00:13:50.381 --> 00:13:51.214
<v Speaker 2>things that we'll talk about today is </v>
<v Speaker 2>Swanson's elaboration of the fact that </v>

258
00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.033
<v Speaker 2>half of the hypothalamus is </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally devoted towards </v>

259
00:13:58.991 --> 00:14:00.490
<v Speaker 2>exploration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is quite cool.</v>

260
00:14:00.491 --> 00:14:02.380
<v Speaker 2>It means exploration is a really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

261
00:14:02.381 --> 00:14:03.214
<v Speaker 2>really old system and it's sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you haven't got anything else to do </v>

262
00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:10.290
<v Speaker 2>so you don't want to play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not hungry,</v>

263
00:14:10.291 --> 00:14:12.630
<v Speaker 2>you're not thirsty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not angry.</v>

264
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.340
<v Speaker 2>You're not too warm or too cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

265
00:14:15.341 --> 00:14:16.174
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your default isn't sort of quiescent </v>

266
00:14:18.781 --> 00:14:19.800
<v Speaker 2>sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

267
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:20.873
<v Speaker 2>You don't just</v>

268
00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:25.890
<v Speaker 2>run out of batteries and lie on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>floor unless you're of course,</v>

269
00:14:25.891 --> 00:14:27.360
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're very tired.</v>

270
00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:28.613
<v Speaker 2>What will generally happen is if the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other fundamental motivational states </v>

271
00:14:31.621 --> 00:14:32.454
<v Speaker 2>have been satiated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you'll engage in exploration and </v>

272
00:14:36.061 --> 00:14:38.280
<v Speaker 2>some different people at different </v>
<v Speaker 2>rates.</v>

273
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:39.623
<v Speaker 2>If you're extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll engage in exploration in the </v>

274
00:14:41.971 --> 00:14:42.804
<v Speaker 2>social environment and if you're open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you'll engage in exploration at a </v>

275
00:14:46.471 --> 00:14:47.304
<v Speaker 2>more cognitive level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that would be with regards to </v>

276
00:14:48.871 --> 00:14:49.704
<v Speaker 2>artistic creativity or to fiction or or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the expression of some sort of </v>

277
00:14:53.181 --> 00:14:57.410
<v Speaker 2>intellectual or philosophical pursuit </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason that you're wired up that</v>

278
00:14:57.411 --> 00:15:00.470
<v Speaker 2>way is because if you have a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>extra energy,</v>

279
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.393
<v Speaker 2>you might as well use that to map out </v>
<v Speaker 2>more of the environment so that when </v>

280
00:15:06.201 --> 00:15:08.780
<v Speaker 2>push comes to shove somewhere down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>road,</v>

281
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:10.423
<v Speaker 2>he'll be in possession of more </v>
<v Speaker 2>information and more flexible and more </v>

282
00:15:13.851 --> 00:15:16.100
<v Speaker 2>knowledgeable in your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In your,</v>

283
00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.880
<v Speaker 2>in your conceptual and perceptual </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures and also in your actions.</v>

284
00:15:19.881 --> 00:15:23.690
<v Speaker 2>So people have a pretty strong tendency </v>
<v Speaker 2>to default to exploration,</v>

285
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:25.190
<v Speaker 2>but there's variability in that.</v>

286
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:31.160
<v Speaker 2>You can also sort of divide up these </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivations as ingestive or defensive.</v>

287
00:15:31.161 --> 00:15:31.994
<v Speaker 2>That's not a bad way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's reproductive </v>

288
00:15:34.191 --> 00:15:39.191
<v Speaker 2>motivations as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's unlikely to be a full map.</v>

289
00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:44.420
<v Speaker 2>It kind of depends on where you put the </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions because we know for example,</v>

290
00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:45.523
<v Speaker 2>that there's a separate disgust circuit </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that doesn't seem to load with </v>

291
00:15:48.621 --> 00:15:50.880
<v Speaker 2>anxiety or with pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

292
00:15:50.881 --> 00:15:51.714
<v Speaker 2>it's its own biological</v>
<v Speaker 2>system and it seems to be associated </v>

293
00:15:56.691 --> 00:15:57.524
<v Speaker 2>with trait conscientiousness maybe and </v>
<v Speaker 2>also with political conservatism in </v>

294
00:16:01.881 --> 00:16:02.714
<v Speaker 2>orderliness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those things are all quite </v>

295
00:16:03.771 --> 00:16:06.290
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all kind of clumped together and.</v>

296
00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:08.630
<v Speaker 2>But whether that's an emotion or </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivations,</v>

297
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:10.850
<v Speaker 2>not exactly clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

298
00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:13.533
<v Speaker 2>we'll talk about it a little bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's the hypothalamus and as you </v>

299
00:16:16.491 --> 00:16:20.030
<v Speaker 2>can see</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not one thing.</v>

300
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.073
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing at the macro level in the brain </v>

301
00:16:23.301 --> 00:16:23.990
<v Speaker 2>is one thing.</v>

302
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:28.070
<v Speaker 2>Obviously it's this layered thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like everything else in the world,</v>

303
00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:28.904
<v Speaker 2>except even more so because the brain is</v>
<v Speaker 2>so incredibly complicated and you can </v>

304
00:16:31.581 --> 00:16:33.770
<v Speaker 2>see by looking at that there's all those</v>
<v Speaker 2>little,</v>

305
00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:38.090
<v Speaker 2>all the things that are colored,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're basically hypothalamic</v>

306
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:40.543
<v Speaker 2>modules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess would be a reasonable way of </v>

307
00:16:42.081 --> 00:16:46.280
<v Speaker 2>putting it and you can tell they're even</v>
<v Speaker 2>at an anatomically distinct,</v>

308
00:16:46.281 --> 00:16:49.160
<v Speaker 2>so obviously they're not doing exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing.</v>

309
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:53.630
<v Speaker 2>So you might think of brain anatomy as </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a fixed,</v>

310
00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.453
<v Speaker 2>what would you call something that we've</v>
<v Speaker 2>already managed quite well and we have </v>

311
00:16:57.741 --> 00:16:58.574
<v Speaker 2>all the categories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Systems down in the structure of the </v>

312
00:16:59.931 --> 00:17:02.870
<v Speaker 2>brain is quite well known and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really not true at all.</v>

313
00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:03.973
<v Speaker 2>Like the brain is truly terra incognita </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it isn't even like our naming a </v>

314
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:08.923
<v Speaker 2>rituals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say our conventions are not </v>

315
00:17:11.301 --> 00:17:15.590
<v Speaker 2>necessarily appropriate for one to one </v>
<v Speaker 2>mapping of say structure onto function.</v>

316
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:18.440
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

317
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:20.240
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're sort of anatomical,</v>

318
00:17:20.241 --> 00:17:23.210
<v Speaker 2>they're markers for anatomical </v>
<v Speaker 2>convenience in some ways.</v>

319
00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:25.070
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

320
00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:25.903
<v Speaker 2>so here's a way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have your frame which specifies </v>

321
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:33.980
<v Speaker 2>your lack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say I'm hungry and then a goal pops up,</v>

322
00:17:33.981 --> 00:17:34.551
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

323
00:17:34.551 --> 00:17:35.384
<v Speaker 2>I should have something to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the hypothalamus is modulating </v>

324
00:17:38.421 --> 00:17:39.254
<v Speaker 2>perceptual and cognitive circuits so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you think that and so that you </v>

325
00:17:42.111 --> 00:17:42.944
<v Speaker 2>start to parse up the world into a place</v>
<v Speaker 2>where a hungry person like you could </v>

326
00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:48.403
<v Speaker 2>become satisfied and then the behaviors </v>
<v Speaker 2>kick in that are relevant to that </v>

327
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:59.660
<v Speaker 2>pursuit and so you can think of yourself</v>
<v Speaker 2>as popping through these sorts of frames</v>

328
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.570
<v Speaker 2>on a fairly sick basis throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

329
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.430
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously you get hungry,</v>

330
00:18:05.431 --> 00:18:07.020
<v Speaker 2>you get thirsty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get tired,</v>

331
00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:08.123
<v Speaker 2>and so your consciousness is being </v>
<v Speaker 2>modulated by subcortical circuitry that </v>

332
00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:14.573
<v Speaker 2>is basically charged with your self </v>
<v Speaker 2>preservation and in some ways you come </v>

333
00:18:19.141 --> 00:18:19.980
<v Speaker 2>along for the ride.</v>

334
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:24.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean your consciousness is mostly </v>
<v Speaker 2>there in some sense to detect deviations</v>

335
00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:28.800
<v Speaker 2>from not so much expectation but from </v>
<v Speaker 2>desire,</v>

336
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:29.663
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you lay out one of these little </v>

337
00:18:30.241 --> 00:18:31.074
<v Speaker 2>maps on the world and then you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>something to happen and what your </v>

338
00:18:34.171 --> 00:18:35.004
<v Speaker 2>consciousness does more or less is more </v>
<v Speaker 2>monitor and if something that you don't </v>

339
00:18:40.861 --> 00:18:45.510
<v Speaker 2>want to happen happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then consciousness will take a look.</v>

340
00:18:45.511 --> 00:18:46.344
<v Speaker 2>In some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you remember that hierarchy of goals </v>

341
00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:52.740
<v Speaker 2>that I showed you from motor output up </v>
<v Speaker 2>to higher order goals,</v>

342
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.440
<v Speaker 2>your consciousness kind of moves up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>down that thing.</v>

343
00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:56.843
<v Speaker 2>If you've made an error trying to figure</v>
<v Speaker 2>out at which level of abstraction that </v>

344
00:19:00.451 --> 00:19:01.284
<v Speaker 2>error should be rectified,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is sort of what you do when you </v>

345
00:19:03.631 --> 00:19:04.464
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that process is going to kick in </v>

346
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:11.310
<v Speaker 2>whenever you're moving towards your </v>
<v Speaker 2>desired end and something that you don't</v>

347
00:19:11.311 --> 00:19:12.720
<v Speaker 2>want to have happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>

348
00:19:12.721 --> 00:19:15.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You usually stop that sort of an anxiety</v>

349
00:19:15.841 --> 00:19:17.190
<v Speaker 2>response,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stopping,</v>

350
00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:21.390
<v Speaker 2>and then if nothing else happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's too bad,</v>

351
00:19:21.391 --> 00:19:23.660
<v Speaker 2>well then you'll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll start to explore it in.</v>

352
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:24.533
<v Speaker 2>Animals often do that by moving around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people will do that just as with </v>

353
00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:29.813
<v Speaker 2>equal facility just by running </v>
<v Speaker 2>simulations in their mind and trying to </v>

354
00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:34.770
<v Speaker 2>calculate what went wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

355
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.560
<v Speaker 2>Trying to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a form of exploratory behavior as</v>

356
00:19:37.561 --> 00:19:38.394
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be more associated with </v>

357
00:19:39.451 --> 00:19:41.350
<v Speaker 2>trait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Openness with intelligence.</v>

358
00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:42.873
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

359
00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:47.403
<v Speaker 2>so there's how Swanson divides up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamus see the little pink things </v>

360
00:19:53.591 --> 00:19:57.640
<v Speaker 2>there on the left are part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>defensive circuits,</v>

361
00:19:57.641 --> 00:19:58.474
<v Speaker 2>and then the red things on the left are </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the reproductive circuits and </v>

362
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously those,</v>

363
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:09.310
<v Speaker 2>the fact that those circuits exist lays </v>
<v Speaker 2>onto Darwinian theory quite nicely.</v>

364
00:20:09.431 --> 00:20:10.264
<v Speaker 2>The defensive circuits obviously protect</v>
<v Speaker 2>you from dying in the reproductive </v>

365
00:20:12.911 --> 00:20:14.230
<v Speaker 2>circuits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

366
00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:17.860
<v Speaker 2>facilitate your reproduction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just not much of a</v>

367
00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.800
<v Speaker 2>fairly obvious conclusion.</v>

368
00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:27.680
<v Speaker 2>And so those are all located in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this essential part of the brain,</v>

369
00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:28.873
<v Speaker 2>the hypothalamic hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this is something that's a little </v>

370
00:20:33.921 --> 00:20:34.754
<v Speaker 2>more complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'll go through it a little bit more </v>

371
00:20:36.051 --> 00:20:37.690
<v Speaker 2>carefully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you right,</v>

372
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:38.943
<v Speaker 2>this is where Swanson maps perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 2>onto piaget and I put this one on paper </v>

373
00:20:46.391 --> 00:20:50.200
<v Speaker 2>in as a optional reading,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're interested in the sorts of</v>

374
00:20:50.201 --> 00:20:51.034
<v Speaker 2>things that we're covering this class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it's a great paper to hack your way </v>

375
00:20:53.501 --> 00:20:54.334
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it's very hard because you </v>

376
00:20:57.071 --> 00:20:57.904
<v Speaker 2>learn a lot about the underlying biology</v>
<v Speaker 2>of some of these more complex clinical </v>

377
00:21:03.461 --> 00:21:05.110
<v Speaker 2>and developmental theories that we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>covered.</v>

378
00:21:05.111 --> 00:21:10.111
<v Speaker 2>So basically what Swanson is pointing </v>
<v Speaker 2>out is that at the lowest level,</v>

379
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:14.650
<v Speaker 2>at the highest resolution level of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>central nervous system,</v>

380
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:16.060
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

381
00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:17.283
<v Speaker 2>you have motor output circuits that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>enabling you to move and those are </v>

382
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:25.210
<v Speaker 2>communicating in large part with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>spine,</v>

383
00:21:25.211 --> 00:21:27.600
<v Speaker 2>but also with lower parts of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>brainstem.</v>

384
00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:31.900
<v Speaker 2>So those are fundamental movements of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sorts that PSJ would call reflexive.</v>

385
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:35.470
<v Speaker 2>And then the locomotor pattern </v>
<v Speaker 2>generator.</v>

386
00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:36.483
<v Speaker 2>I think the best way to think about this</v>
<v Speaker 2>from an analogical perspective and how </v>

387
00:21:39.371 --> 00:21:42.730
<v Speaker 2>actually Alexander Luria used this </v>
<v Speaker 2>analogy.</v>

388
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.960
<v Speaker 2>He called behavioral patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kinetic melodies.</v>

389
00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:48.580
<v Speaker 2>It's a lovely phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

390
00:21:48.581 --> 00:21:49.414
<v Speaker 2>because you know how obviously a song is</v>
<v Speaker 2>made out of notes and then the notes </v>

391
00:21:51.881 --> 00:21:55.720
<v Speaker 2>combined into phrases and the phrase </v>
<v Speaker 2>this combined Santa passages and then,</v>

392
00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:56.863
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even more interestingly than if it's an </v>

393
00:21:58.421 --> 00:21:59.254
<v Speaker 2>orchestral piece of music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple instruments are playing at the </v>

394
00:22:01.631 --> 00:22:02.464
<v Speaker 2>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it sort of extends right into the </v>

395
00:22:03.911 --> 00:22:07.120
<v Speaker 2>social domain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But your actions are sort of like that.</v>

396
00:22:07.121 --> 00:22:07.954
<v Speaker 2>They're made out of micro routines and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then those are chained together and </v>

397
00:22:10.571 --> 00:22:13.840
<v Speaker 2>those are chained together in higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>order abstractions and so on.</v>

398
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:14.913
<v Speaker 2>All the way up to the cortex and so he</v>
<v Speaker 2>swanson points out that the the motor </v>

399
00:22:23.711 --> 00:22:28.711
<v Speaker 2>system has three sets of inputs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the cognitive system that sort of way</v>

400
00:22:30.161 --> 00:22:33.430
<v Speaker 2>up that sort of level of abstraction </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's way up in the brain.</v>

401
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:37.180
<v Speaker 2>So the cognitive system is where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know you might do a voluntary auction,</v>

402
00:22:37.181 --> 00:22:38.014
<v Speaker 2>so you look at something and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm going to pick up this piece of </v>

403
00:22:39.581 --> 00:22:40.414
<v Speaker 2>paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's top down cortical control </v>

404
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:47.290
<v Speaker 2>and then the state system input to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>motor system.</v>

405
00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:52.530
<v Speaker 2>The state system is your body monitoring</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on inside of itself and the</v>

406
00:22:53.201 --> 00:22:56.080
<v Speaker 2>autonomic nervous system is part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>motor output system.</v>

407
00:22:56.081 --> 00:23:00.940
<v Speaker 2>And so the state monitoring system takes</v>
<v Speaker 2>a careful look and the hypothalamus does</v>

408
00:23:00.941 --> 00:23:01.774
<v Speaker 2>a fair bit of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Takes a careful look at what's going on </v>

409
00:23:03.431 --> 00:23:04.264
<v Speaker 2>inside you and then activates different </v>
<v Speaker 2>parts of your digestive and you know </v>

410
00:23:08.041 --> 00:23:12.130
<v Speaker 2>that the gut system fundamentally that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have no conscious control over.</v>

411
00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:15.670
<v Speaker 2>And then obviously their sensory system </v>
<v Speaker 2>inputs to.</v>

412
00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:16.893
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those are the three main inputs into </v>

413
00:23:19.121 --> 00:23:19.954
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the motor system and that acts on </v>

414
00:23:21.731 --> 00:23:22.564
<v Speaker 2>the environment.</v>

415
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:23.583
<v Speaker 2>And then the motor system has this </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchical nature that's built from </v>

416
00:23:27.251 --> 00:23:28.084
<v Speaker 2>the spine upwards and so you can think </v>
<v Speaker 2>of like the brain as a collection of </v>

417
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:33.903
<v Speaker 2>ever expanding control systems that </v>
<v Speaker 2>allow you to what learn and undertake </v>

418
00:23:40.811 --> 00:23:43.330
<v Speaker 2>evermore complex motor schemes of </v>
<v Speaker 2>action.</v>

419
00:23:43.331 --> 00:23:44.164
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things that people think </v>

420
00:23:45.381 --> 00:23:48.140
<v Speaker 2>about human beings is that we're very </v>
<v Speaker 2>good at thinking,</v>

421
00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:49.363
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we're not good at thinking like </v>

422
00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:52.203
<v Speaker 2>we're crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazily adaptable in terms of our motor </v>

423
00:23:55.581 --> 00:23:56.414
<v Speaker 2>output.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you watch the watch the </v>

424
00:23:57.921 --> 00:23:58.754
<v Speaker 2>Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know when you see human beings can </v>

425
00:24:01.581 --> 00:24:04.520
<v Speaker 2>do things that no other animal could </v>
<v Speaker 2>even think of doing.</v>

426
00:24:04.521 --> 00:24:05.354
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're completely crazy when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to the sorts of things we can do </v>

427
00:24:07.851 --> 00:24:10.100
<v Speaker 2>with our body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're good on ice,</v>

428
00:24:10.101 --> 00:24:12.230
<v Speaker 2>we're good in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can ski.</v>

429
00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:15.260
<v Speaker 2>People are really good at jumping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can climb across buildings.</v>

430
00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:16.693
<v Speaker 2>People who train themselves can climb </v>
<v Speaker 2>like mad mean human beings are </v>

431
00:24:19.731 --> 00:24:22.340
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably variable in terms of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>motor output.</v>

432
00:24:22.341 --> 00:24:25.640
<v Speaker 2>So that's another part of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence that's not just abstract.</v>

433
00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:26.953
<v Speaker 2>And so in part that's because we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>this very well developed cortical area </v>

434
00:24:30.981 --> 00:24:31.814
<v Speaker 2>that enables us to chain evermore </v>
<v Speaker 2>complex patterns of behavior together </v>

435
00:24:36.111 --> 00:24:36.944
<v Speaker 2>and also to develop patterns of behavior</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are sort of outside instinctual </v>

436
00:24:40.821 --> 00:24:44.090
<v Speaker 2>specification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you imagine with an animal that has a</v>

437
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:45.343
<v Speaker 2>less complex brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of its behavior is going to be </v>

438
00:24:48.651 --> 00:24:49.484
<v Speaker 2>limited to those quads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a instinctual patterns of behavior that </v>

439
00:24:52.761 --> 00:24:57.500
<v Speaker 2>are devoted directly towards the </v>
<v Speaker 2>solution of basic biological problems.</v>

440
00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.903
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can kind of solve those without too </v>

441
00:25:00.291 --> 00:25:01.124
<v Speaker 2>much effort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we have all the spare motor </v>

442
00:25:02.241 --> 00:25:04.910
<v Speaker 2>capacity leftover and people do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>weirdest things with it,</v>

443
00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:06.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

444
00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:10.490
<v Speaker 2>and really remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely remarkable things.</v>

445
00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.330
<v Speaker 2>So that's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're pretty cool that way.</v>

446
00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:18.170
<v Speaker 2>We don't get enough credit for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think because human beings think</v>

447
00:25:18.171 --> 00:25:19.880
<v Speaker 2>about human being as an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

448
00:25:19.881 --> 00:25:21.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are kind of loath to do.</v>

449
00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:23.990
<v Speaker 2>We are definitely the most interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>

450
00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:29.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you saw like a what a pygmy </v>
<v Speaker 2>hippopotamus skateboarding,</v>

451
00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:31.250
<v Speaker 2>you'd think that was pretty remarkable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

452
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:32.323
<v Speaker 2>but people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do those sorts of things all the </v>

453
00:25:33.561 --> 00:25:35.060
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

454
00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:40.070
<v Speaker 2>we just take it as a matter of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lowest amount of motor neuron pools,</v>

455
00:25:40.071 --> 00:25:41.840
<v Speaker 2>the lowest level of the locomotor </v>
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

456
00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:47.170
<v Speaker 2>it's locomotion and an action is formed </v>
<v Speaker 2>by a subset of motoneuron tools.</v>

457
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:53.480
<v Speaker 2>That's wrong motor neurons in the spinal</v>
<v Speaker 2>cord,</v>

458
00:25:53.481 --> 00:25:54.314
<v Speaker 2>ventral horn that innovates the limb </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscles responsible for locomotor </v>

459
00:25:57.351 --> 00:25:58.184
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dictated this with dragon dictate and </v>

460
00:26:01.101 --> 00:26:03.410
<v Speaker 2>now then it does weird thing say so </v>
<v Speaker 2>tools,</v>

461
00:26:03.411 --> 00:26:04.850
<v Speaker 2>God only knows where that came from.</v>

462
00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:09.560
<v Speaker 2>So a set of motor neurons in the spinal </v>
<v Speaker 2>cord,</v>

463
00:26:09.561 --> 00:26:10.394
<v Speaker 2>ventral horn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's way down in the spine that </v>

464
00:26:11.811 --> 00:26:15.410
<v Speaker 2>innovate the law must limb muscles </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible for locomotor behavior.</v>

465
00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:18.980
<v Speaker 2>When you start to think about the brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>as something that moves your body,</v>

466
00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:19.963
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot easier to conceptualize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The is something that's distributed </v>

467
00:26:22.371 --> 00:26:25.910
<v Speaker 2>through the body and your spine is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually quite smart.</v>

468
00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.640
<v Speaker 2>So even though in some sense you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>think with it,</v>

469
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:33.230
<v Speaker 2>it's capable of very complex sensory </v>
<v Speaker 2>detection and also motor mapping.</v>

470
00:26:33.231 --> 00:26:34.064
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm mostly relatively automated </v>
<v Speaker 2>and relatively reflexive one level up </v>

471
00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:44.850
<v Speaker 2>the existence of a spinal locomotor </v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern generator.</v>

472
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:45.833
<v Speaker 2>So this shows that the spine isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible just for the most basic of </v>

473
00:26:48.961 --> 00:26:52.020
<v Speaker 2>motor outputs or sensory inputs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can actually generate patterns,</v>

474
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:53.093
<v Speaker 2>is demonstrated by the fact that whereas</v>
<v Speaker 2>a spinal animal displays no spontaneous </v>

475
00:26:57.781 --> 00:27:02.250
<v Speaker 2>locomotor activity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you sever an animal,</v>

476
00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.380
<v Speaker 2>it's nervous system.</v>

477
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:07.260
<v Speaker 2>So it only has the spine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll just lay there,</v>

478
00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:09.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd think it's paralyzed,</v>

479
00:27:09.001 --> 00:27:13.230
<v Speaker 2>that's what you would think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But coordinated limb movements,</v>

480
00:27:13.231 --> 00:27:14.064
<v Speaker 2>characteristic of locomotion may be </v>
<v Speaker 2>elicited when the limbs of such an </v>

481
00:27:17.251 --> 00:27:18.084
<v Speaker 2>animal are placed on a moving treadmill </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's providing sematic sensory input </v>

482
00:27:21.451 --> 00:27:24.510
<v Speaker 2>to the pattern generator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they've done this with people who</v>

483
00:27:24.511 --> 00:27:27.330
<v Speaker 2>are paraplegic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you take someone who's paraplegic and</v>

484
00:27:27.331 --> 00:27:28.164
<v Speaker 2>so they can't obviously walk and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>hoist them up and you put them on a </v>

485
00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:33.563
<v Speaker 2>treadmill and you lean them forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their legs will walk and that spinal </v>

486
00:27:36.991 --> 00:27:37.824
<v Speaker 2>controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what you're doing with your </v>

487
00:27:39.991 --> 00:27:40.824
<v Speaker 2>spine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

488
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:42.420
<v Speaker 2>because you're not thinking when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk,</v>

489
00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:44.640
<v Speaker 2>you're or you're not thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>walking and less,</v>

490
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less.</v>

491
00:27:46.831 --> 00:27:49.590
<v Speaker 2>You're one of those people who can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>chew gum and walk at the same time.</v>

492
00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:50.843
<v Speaker 2>So anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it just shows you how complex you </v>

493
00:27:54.151 --> 00:27:54.984
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even at the sort of the base levels of </v>

494
00:27:57.541 --> 00:27:59.970
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your intelligence hierarchy,</v>

495
00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:03.090
<v Speaker 2>level up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>locomotor pattern controller.</v>

496
00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:08.240
<v Speaker 2>So it's controlling the</v>
<v Speaker 2>locomotor pattern generator</v>

497
00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:10.973
<v Speaker 2>in contrast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>undisturbed chronic hypothalamic </v>

498
00:28:13.441 --> 00:28:14.131
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

499
00:28:14.131 --> 00:28:14.964
<v Speaker 2>So now one of the ways people figured </v>
<v Speaker 2>out how the brain works was by </v>

500
00:28:17.491 --> 00:28:18.324
<v Speaker 2>sectioning animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nervous systems when they alive at </v>

501
00:28:20.491 --> 00:28:21.324
<v Speaker 2>different levels of complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a spinal animal is one that's </v>

502
00:28:23.761 --> 00:28:26.760
<v Speaker 2>basically paralyzed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's brain is separated from it's spinal</v>

503
00:28:26.761 --> 00:28:27.594
<v Speaker 2>cord,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you can separate the </v>

504
00:28:28.381 --> 00:28:31.440
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamus with the intact spinal </v>
<v Speaker 2>cord.</v>

505
00:28:31.441 --> 00:28:32.274
<v Speaker 2>So it's one unit from the cortex and </v>
<v Speaker 2>even from the memory systems and even </v>

506
00:28:35.821 --> 00:28:36.654
<v Speaker 2>for most of the emotion systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the animal in some sense hardly </v>

507
00:28:39.541 --> 00:28:41.460
<v Speaker 2>has a brain at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

508
00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:42.323
<v Speaker 2>I mean the hypothalamus is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you saw it's a little tiny thing and </v>

509
00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:45.083
<v Speaker 2>everything that's on top of that can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>separated from it and the animal can </v>

510
00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:53.850
<v Speaker 2>still act spontaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

511
00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:54.923
<v Speaker 2>So here's an example if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this has been done with cat and if </v>

512
00:28:58.141 --> 00:29:03.141
<v Speaker 2>you have a female cat and it's in a cage</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's only a hypothalami animal,</v>

513
00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:04.373
<v Speaker 2>it can basically manage like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can't learn new things very well and </v>

514
00:29:08.191 --> 00:29:13.191
<v Speaker 2>it can't remember anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it doesn't have episodic memory and</v>

515
00:29:13.531 --> 00:29:14.550
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it can,</v>

516
00:29:14.551 --> 00:29:16.920
<v Speaker 2>it can maintain its temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can eat,</v>

517
00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:19.200
<v Speaker 2>it can engage in sexual activity.</v>

518
00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:23.030
<v Speaker 2>It's got defensive aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like most of the animal in some sense is</v>

519
00:29:23.031 --> 00:29:26.460
<v Speaker 2>still there from an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from an input output perspective.</v>

520
00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:29.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also hyper exploratory,</v>

521
00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.100
<v Speaker 2>which is quite interesting because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't think,</v>

522
00:29:32.101 --> 00:29:32.934
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal with no brain is the most </v>

523
00:29:34.351 --> 00:29:37.320
<v Speaker 2>exploratory kind of animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

524
00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.930
<v Speaker 2>it happens to be the case as long as it </v>
<v Speaker 2>has the hypothalamus.</v>

525
00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.850
<v Speaker 2>So that shows you a how old exploration </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

526
00:29:42.851 --> 00:29:43.684
<v Speaker 2>but it also kind of gives you some clue </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what the rest of the brain is </v>

527
00:29:45.611 --> 00:29:48.580
<v Speaker 2>doing mean</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

528
00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:51.160
<v Speaker 2>you explored new things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll say.</v>

529
00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:52.563
<v Speaker 2>So what that means is you have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to tell the difference between </v>

530
00:29:54.131 --> 00:29:54.964
<v Speaker 2>what's new and what isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what you need to tell the </v>

531
00:29:57.311 --> 00:30:02.260
<v Speaker 2>difference between what's new and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't is memory and so a lot of what the</v>

532
00:30:02.261 --> 00:30:03.094
<v Speaker 2>higher order parts of the brain are </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing is basically keeping track of </v>

533
00:30:05.861 --> 00:30:06.850
<v Speaker 2>where you've been.</v>

534
00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:08.343
<v Speaker 2>And so if you've been somewhere before </v>
<v Speaker 2>then the exploratory circuit is </v>

535
00:30:11.381 --> 00:30:12.214
<v Speaker 2>basically shut off as long as everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're doing there is working and </v>

536
00:30:16.331 --> 00:30:20.560
<v Speaker 2>you need the whole brain basically to </v>
<v Speaker 2>shut off the hypothalamus in some sense.</v>

537
00:30:20.561 --> 00:30:21.394
<v Speaker 2>That's how the thing works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're kind of a default on </v>

538
00:30:24.371 --> 00:30:25.510
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

539
00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:26.523
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your motor systems are ready to go and </v>

540
00:30:27.731 --> 00:30:30.280
<v Speaker 2>you're Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're alive and you're ready to go like</v>

541
00:30:30.281 --> 00:30:31.114
<v Speaker 2>a wild animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the cortex dampens that down and it </v>

542
00:30:33.551 --> 00:30:34.384
<v Speaker 2>does that by only allowing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>activities that are relevant to that </v>

543
00:30:37.901 --> 00:30:38.734
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That might be none of them to function </v>

544
00:30:40.541 --> 00:30:41.374
<v Speaker 2>at any one time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you take off the cortex while the </v>

545
00:30:43.901 --> 00:30:46.300
<v Speaker 2>animal can still do a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

546
00:30:46.301 --> 00:30:47.134
<v Speaker 2>its ability to match its behavior to </v>
<v Speaker 2>novel situations and to learn new </v>

547
00:30:50.351 --> 00:30:51.820
<v Speaker 2>behaviors is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very limited.</v>

548
00:30:51.821 --> 00:30:52.654
<v Speaker 2>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes hyper exploratory but it </v>

549
00:30:55.001 --> 00:30:56.140
<v Speaker 2>can't remember anything.</v>

550
00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:59.800
<v Speaker 2>And it becomes very limited in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>flexibility of its behavior,</v>

551
00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:05.040
<v Speaker 2>and so as you move farther up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy of complexity,</v>

552
00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:09.910
<v Speaker 2>then you're able to do more and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>novel and more and more complex and more</v>

553
00:31:09.911 --> 00:31:10.744
<v Speaker 2>and more situation specific things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the sense of providing a certain </v>

554
00:31:17.021 --> 00:31:20.770
<v Speaker 2>level of endogenous activity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means self-generated activity.</v>

555
00:31:20.771 --> 00:31:25.450
<v Speaker 2>So the hypothalamic thalamic animal will</v>
<v Speaker 2>move by itself without being stimulated.</v>

556
00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:26.863
<v Speaker 2>The hypothalamic locomotor region can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought of as a locomotor pattern </v>

557
00:31:30.281 --> 00:31:31.114
<v Speaker 2>controller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which generates spontaneous inputs </v>

558
00:31:33.071 --> 00:31:36.100
<v Speaker 2>ultimately to the spinal locomotor </v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern generator.</v>

559
00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:36.963
<v Speaker 2>So this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's hierarchy already talked about </v>

560
00:31:39.731 --> 00:31:40.564
<v Speaker 2>behavioral state inputs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's another picture of the nervous </v>

561
00:31:42.521 --> 00:31:44.440
<v Speaker 2>system just to remind you of how it </v>
<v Speaker 2>looks.</v>

562
00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:49.270
<v Speaker 2>Now it's distributed through the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

563
00:31:49.271 --> 00:31:50.104
<v Speaker 2>this is very interesting too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't learn this until I read this </v>

564
00:31:53.591 --> 00:31:55.570
<v Speaker 2>paper by Swanson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

565
00:31:55.571 --> 00:31:57.460
<v Speaker 2>that's so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could I have not learned that?</v>

566
00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:00.610
<v Speaker 2>Like 30 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Swanson said that.</v>

567
00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.660
<v Speaker 2>Let's go back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One did.</v>

568
00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:04.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Raymond.</v>

569
00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:07.150
<v Speaker 2>Kal was like the world's greatest </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroanatomist.</v>

570
00:32:07.151 --> 00:32:09.530
<v Speaker 2>He was the guy who really established </v>
<v Speaker 2>the field,</v>

571
00:32:09.531 --> 00:32:12.880
<v Speaker 2>so did a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigation into the fine structure of</v>

572
00:32:12.881 --> 00:32:15.730
<v Speaker 2>the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a 110 years ago,</v>

573
00:32:15.731 --> 00:32:16.564
<v Speaker 2>a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he pointed out that sensory systems </v>

574
00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:22.510
<v Speaker 2>have a dual projection within the </v>
<v Speaker 2>central nervous system.</v>

575
00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.640
<v Speaker 2>I told you guys about blind sight </v>
<v Speaker 2>already,</v>

576
00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:25.503
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that your eyes map onto </v>

577
00:32:27.401 --> 00:32:28.234
<v Speaker 2>different levels of the hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say of sensory input and motor control </v>

578
00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:35.440
<v Speaker 2>cajal basically outlined the circuitry </v>
<v Speaker 2>for that one branch goes directly to the</v>

579
00:32:35.441 --> 00:32:37.260
<v Speaker 2>motor system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's.</v>

580
00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:41.480
<v Speaker 2>That's for I to output mappings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's fast because there's not a lot</v>

581
00:32:41.481 --> 00:32:42.314
<v Speaker 2>of thinking in between.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might think that's bad because you </v>

582
00:32:45.321 --> 00:32:47.810
<v Speaker 2>want to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's good because sometimes you know</v>

583
00:32:47.811 --> 00:32:49.160
<v Speaker 2>what to do and you don't want to thank </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

584
00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.770
<v Speaker 2>Just want to execute it as fast as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly can.</v>

585
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:55.010
<v Speaker 2>So these lower orders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>simpler inputs are good for that sort of</v>

586
00:32:55.011 --> 00:32:55.844
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One goes directly to the motor system </v>

587
00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:58.393
<v Speaker 2>and the other goal is more or less </v>
<v Speaker 2>directly to the cerebral cortex where </v>

588
00:33:00.861 --> 00:33:01.694
<v Speaker 2>sensations and perceptions are </v>
<v Speaker 2>elaborated and voluntary motor impulses </v>

589
00:33:04.671 --> 00:33:05.504
<v Speaker 2>are generated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this sort of explains for long time </v>

590
00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:09.793
<v Speaker 2>experimental psychology was dominated by</v>
<v Speaker 2>behaviorists who thought of the animal </v>

591
00:33:12.741 --> 00:33:13.574
<v Speaker 2>as a stimulus response machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And never paid much attention to the </v>

592
00:33:17.271 --> 00:33:18.104
<v Speaker 2>function of things like thought or </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion or complex internal states and </v>

593
00:33:22.311 --> 00:33:24.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the behaviors got an awful long way with</v>

594
00:33:24.891 --> 00:33:29.240
<v Speaker 2>the idea of the animal as a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>simple stimulus response machine.</v>

595
00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:32.300
<v Speaker 2>And that's partly because of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy that we're describing,</v>

596
00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:33.153
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can treat an animal as if </v>

597
00:33:35.811 --> 00:33:39.770
<v Speaker 2>it's a pretty simple machine because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>has all that simple machinery in it.</v>

598
00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:42.780
<v Speaker 2>It's just that on top of that simple </v>
<v Speaker 2>machinery,</v>

599
00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:45.560
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot more complex machinery and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

600
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:46.543
<v Speaker 2>But the simple machinery does a lot more</v>
<v Speaker 2>than people generally think and can do </v>

601
00:33:49.101 --> 00:33:53.480
<v Speaker 2>more than people think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the fact that there are these,</v>

602
00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:56.240
<v Speaker 2>at least two projections,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they branch more than that,</v>

603
00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:57.403
<v Speaker 2>gives you right away a sense of why the </v>
<v Speaker 2>behaviors could have been right and the </v>

604
00:34:01.071 --> 00:34:02.750
<v Speaker 2>cognitive psychologists could have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

605
00:34:02.751 --> 00:34:03.584
<v Speaker 2>And even the cycle dynamic thinkers can </v>
<v Speaker 2>be right because they're analyzing the </v>

606
00:34:06.951 --> 00:34:07.784
<v Speaker 2>system at different levels of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchical complexity and extracting </v>

607
00:34:10.821 --> 00:34:11.654
<v Speaker 2>out slightly different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call a observations and </v>

608
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:18.763
<v Speaker 2>some of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or even like the simpler systems can </v>

609
00:34:21.201 --> 00:34:22.790
<v Speaker 2>have quite complex output.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

610
00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:23.953
<v Speaker 2>so one of the things that the simpler </v>
<v Speaker 2>sensory motor system does is detect </v>

611
00:34:26.871 --> 00:34:29.480
<v Speaker 2>snakes because primates don't like </v>
<v Speaker 2>snakes.</v>

612
00:34:29.481 --> 00:34:31.460
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a woman named</v>

613
00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:34.293
<v Speaker 2>Lynne Isbell wrote a nice book on </v>
<v Speaker 2>primate vision and snakes and she was </v>

614
00:34:37.641 --> 00:34:40.100
<v Speaker 2>very curious about why human beings </v>
<v Speaker 2>could see so well.</v>

615
00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:43.100
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she also noticed that we're very good at</v>

616
00:34:43.101 --> 00:34:43.934
<v Speaker 2>detecting</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sort of camouflage patterns that </v>

617
00:34:47.571 --> 00:34:48.404
<v Speaker 2>snakes used,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in the lower half of our </v>

618
00:34:49.731 --> 00:34:50.564
<v Speaker 2>visual field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she did this cross cultural survey </v>

619
00:34:53.691 --> 00:34:57.740
<v Speaker 2>around the world and found out that </v>
<v Speaker 2>where there's more predatory snakes,</v>

620
00:34:57.741 --> 00:34:58.574
<v Speaker 2>the primates have better vision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we of co evolved with snakes and </v>

621
00:35:01.731 --> 00:35:04.100
<v Speaker 2>snakes gave us vision just like it says </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Genesis,</v>

622
00:35:04.101 --> 00:35:06.590
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty damn funny as far as I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned.</v>

623
00:35:06.591 --> 00:35:07.424
<v Speaker 2>And it was snakes in trees even so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And fruit of course gave us color </v>

624
00:35:10.641 --> 00:35:11.474
<v Speaker 2>vision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the whole genesis story nailed it </v>

625
00:35:13.221 --> 00:35:15.670
<v Speaker 2>pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

626
00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.553
<v Speaker 2>snakes have been around long enough and </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been our enemy or say predatory </v>

627
00:35:19.221 --> 00:35:20.210
<v Speaker 2>reptiles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

628
00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.450
<v Speaker 2>if you don't really want to go with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little snake thing that are,</v>

629
00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:24.620
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've evolved.</v>

630
00:35:24.621 --> 00:35:26.990
<v Speaker 2>We've evolved with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like 60 million years.</v>

631
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:28.610
<v Speaker 2>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very long period of time.</v>

632
00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:33.500
<v Speaker 2>So Darwin used to amuse himself in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Darwinian way.</v>

633
00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:38.550
<v Speaker 2>He'd go to the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a zoo or a rep place that shows</v>

634
00:35:38.551 --> 00:35:40.320
<v Speaker 2>reptiles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what they're called,</v>

635
00:35:40.321 --> 00:35:43.950
<v Speaker 2>but they had one glass cage where there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was some kind of poisonous snake,</v>

636
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:44.813
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a cobra,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Darwin would put his face right up </v>

637
00:35:46.771 --> 00:35:51.210
<v Speaker 2>against the glass and the kroger would </v>
<v Speaker 2>go whack and he jumped back and he.</v>

638
00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:52.913
<v Speaker 2>He did that many times because he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>curious about whether or not he could </v>

639
00:35:54.871 --> 00:35:59.010
<v Speaker 2>actually bring this snake avoidance </v>
<v Speaker 2>reflex under conscious control.</v>

640
00:35:59.011 --> 00:36:01.020
<v Speaker 2>And he couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time the snake jumped,</v>

641
00:36:01.021 --> 00:36:02.820
<v Speaker 2>he'd jumped backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't control it.</v>

642
00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:04.163
<v Speaker 2>And so that's because all the primates </v>
<v Speaker 2>that could control it when there were </v>

643
00:36:07.681 --> 00:36:08.514
<v Speaker 2>snakes biting them are dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was Darwin was the beneficiary of </v>

644
00:36:13.321 --> 00:36:15.960
<v Speaker 2>the Darwinian process in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In that sense.</v>

645
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:19.260
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the point is your body's conserved,</v>

646
00:36:19.261 --> 00:36:20.094
<v Speaker 2>all these low level fast operating </v>
<v Speaker 2>circuits and so you're a simple machine </v>

647
00:36:23.431 --> 00:36:26.520
<v Speaker 2>in this sort of complex machine and an </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely complex machine.</v>

648
00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:27.533
<v Speaker 2>And then something that's so complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can't even think about it as a </v>

649
00:36:29.941 --> 00:36:32.310
<v Speaker 2>machine and you're all those things at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same time.</v>

650
00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:35.493
<v Speaker 2>There's Swanson's take on how the motor </v>
<v Speaker 2>system and the hypothalamus are </v>

651
00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:40.620
<v Speaker 2>integrated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's quite nice.</v>

652
00:36:40.621 --> 00:36:45.420
<v Speaker 2>He shows that hypothalamic controller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's one of the circuits that we've</v>

653
00:36:45.421 --> 00:36:48.390
<v Speaker 2>been talking about that are responsible </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a basic motivated state,</v>

654
00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:51.360
<v Speaker 2>get sensory input,</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavioral state input.</v>

655
00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:54.900
<v Speaker 2>That's about the body and the input from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cerebral hemispheres,</v>

656
00:36:54.901 --> 00:36:55.734
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's thought or or voluntary action </v>

657
00:36:59.041 --> 00:37:00.360
<v Speaker 2>plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

658
00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:04.530
<v Speaker 2>And then it has output to the motor </v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern initiator,</v>

659
00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:09.030
<v Speaker 2>the generators and the motor neuron </v>
<v Speaker 2>pools and then you act lovely.</v>

660
00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:10.830
<v Speaker 2>It's a beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful model.</v>

661
00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:16.170
<v Speaker 2>And so you can see that it maps very </v>
<v Speaker 2>nicely onto that with the sort of higher</v>

662
00:37:16.171 --> 00:37:17.004
<v Speaker 2>order levels of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the hierarchy of sensory motor </v>

663
00:37:20.581 --> 00:37:21.414
<v Speaker 2>framing associated with cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstractions in the lowest levels </v>

664
00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:28.530
<v Speaker 2>associated with those sorts of things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you do with your spine.</v>

665
00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:30.563
<v Speaker 2>And this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I flip this upside down here because </v>

666
00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:34.493
<v Speaker 2>it's I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been very interested in how people </v>

667
00:37:37.261 --> 00:37:38.094
<v Speaker 2>get traumatized and it's easier to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>of trauma when you flip the thing </v>

668
00:37:41.521 --> 00:37:44.820
<v Speaker 2>because once you develop the higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>order abstractions,</v>

669
00:37:44.821 --> 00:37:45.660
<v Speaker 2>cortically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

670
00:37:45.661 --> 00:37:46.141
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

671
00:37:46.141 --> 00:37:47.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm a good person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

672
00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:48.803
<v Speaker 2>Then that's sort of the fact that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good person or what constitutes good </v>

673
00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:57.570
<v Speaker 2>starts to become a box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The box within which all the things that</v>

674
00:37:57.571 --> 00:38:01.260
<v Speaker 2>are associated with it are put.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the dangers of abstraction,</v>

675
00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:03.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And categorization.</v>

676
00:38:03.061 --> 00:38:07.410
<v Speaker 2>Because if you couldn't think of </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself as a good or bad person,</v>

677
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:10.410
<v Speaker 2>let's say you didn't have that capacity </v>
<v Speaker 2>for that level of abstraction,</v>

678
00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.810
<v Speaker 2>which is like a binary abstraction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

679
00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:15.420
<v Speaker 2>Good is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

680
00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:21.990
<v Speaker 2>one in and bad is zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a really.</v>

681
00:38:21.991 --> 00:38:26.991
<v Speaker 2>It's a really simple abstraction and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone,</v>

682
00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:30.360
<v Speaker 2>if you do something that a good person </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't do well,</v>

683
00:38:30.361 --> 00:38:33.690
<v Speaker 2>clearly you don't fit into one category </v>
<v Speaker 2>because a good person wouldn't do that.</v>

684
00:38:33.691 --> 00:38:38.260
<v Speaker 2>So maybe you fit into the zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's that capacity for abstraction</v>

685
00:38:38.261 --> 00:38:39.094
<v Speaker 2>is also precisely the sort of thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>allows human beings to undermine </v>

686
00:38:41.351 --> 00:38:42.520
<v Speaker 2>themselves with thought.</v>

687
00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:45.850
<v Speaker 2>Because once you have that capacity for </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstraction,</v>

688
00:38:45.851 --> 00:38:48.590
<v Speaker 2>you can make these ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 2>overgeneralizations.</v>

689
00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:49.750
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really simple.</v>

690
00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:51.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a horrible person.</v>

691
00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:52.893
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's how a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who's really depressed things </v>

692
00:38:54.881 --> 00:38:58.600
<v Speaker 2>whenever anything goes wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's the danger,</v>

693
00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:02.530
<v Speaker 2>the powerful danger of abstraction is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can make a terrible mistake and</v>

694
00:39:02.531 --> 00:39:05.560
<v Speaker 2>overgeneralization this is partly </v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

695
00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:08.890
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say a harder goal.</v>

696
00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:14.020
<v Speaker 2>You're out with your girlfriend and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>flirt with someone else.</v>

697
00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:16.563
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what does that say about your </v>

698
00:39:19.541 --> 00:39:21.250
<v Speaker 2>character?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

699
00:39:21.251 --> 00:39:24.250
<v Speaker 2>she might think that puts you in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>zero category like now,</v>

700
00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:25.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not a good person.</v>

701
00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:27.071
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

702
00:39:27.071 --> 00:39:28.330
<v Speaker 2>it's complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>

703
00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:31.600
<v Speaker 2>is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you belong in that zero category?</v>

704
00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.850
<v Speaker 2>She might treat you like that for a week</v>
<v Speaker 2>or two.</v>

705
00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:35.213
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't you be taking yourself apart </v>

706
00:39:36.401 --> 00:39:38.320
<v Speaker 2>completely because you've made that </v>
<v Speaker 2>error?</v>

707
00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:39.693
<v Speaker 2>Or should you seek farther down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chain of abstractions for a more </v>

708
00:39:43.331 --> 00:39:45.850
<v Speaker 2>specific mistake and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or should she help you do that?</v>

709
00:39:45.851 --> 00:39:46.511
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

710
00:39:46.511 --> 00:39:48.220
<v Speaker 2>you're not a complete zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're more like a,</v>

711
00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>point one.</v>

712
00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:50.793
<v Speaker 2>She could help you figure out exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>where in your personality hierarchy you </v>

713
00:39:53.681 --> 00:39:56.140
<v Speaker 2>have this fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So being that it's a fault,</v>

714
00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.273
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's an indication that the </v>

715
00:39:57.821 --> 00:39:59.680
<v Speaker 2>relationship is over who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows.</v>

716
00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:00.963
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to show you that because then </v>

717
00:40:04.211 --> 00:40:05.044
<v Speaker 2>you can develop a sense of how this </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchical system can also lead to </v>

718
00:40:08.021 --> 00:40:11.920
<v Speaker 2>cataclysmic overgeneralization and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's associated with lots of different</v>

719
00:40:11.921 --> 00:40:12.754
<v Speaker 2>mental illnesses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially depression because depressed </v>

720
00:40:14.741 --> 00:40:18.070
<v Speaker 2>people generally go from a small </v>
<v Speaker 2>mistake,</v>

721
00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:21.790
<v Speaker 2>a mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard to parameterize,</v>

722
00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:24.190
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the highest level of abstraction say,</v>

723
00:40:24.191 --> 00:40:26.470
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've made error a therefore and useless,</v>

724
00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:29.110
<v Speaker 2>or therefore I bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not good.</v>

725
00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:31.300
<v Speaker 2>It's too undifferentiated.</v>

726
00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:35.920
<v Speaker 2>I put that in there to remind you that </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these little things</v>

727
00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:42.450
<v Speaker 2>are informed</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the underlying hypothalamic circuits.</v>

728
00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:48.730
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that whole hierarchy has to be.</v>

729
00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:51.820
<v Speaker 2>Imagine how it's conditioned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That whole hierarchy of motor output,</v>

730
00:40:51.821 --> 00:40:52.654
<v Speaker 2>part of it is conditioned by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then this is sort of like an output </v>

731
00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:58.330
<v Speaker 2>or an input system that Sorenson didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about,</v>

732
00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:59.223
<v Speaker 2>sort of sensory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That whole motor sensory sensory motor </v>

733
00:41:03.011 --> 00:41:04.990
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensory motor perception,</v>

734
00:41:04.991 --> 00:41:05.824
<v Speaker 2>action hierarchy will say has to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>constructed so that your basic </v>

735
00:41:09.821 --> 00:41:13.210
<v Speaker 2>motivational states stay satiated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

736
00:41:13.211 --> 00:41:16.600
<v Speaker 2>Because otherwise you get thirsty enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you die or you get hungry enough and</v>

737
00:41:16.601 --> 00:41:17.434
<v Speaker 2>you die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you have to organize your </v>

738
00:41:19.871 --> 00:41:23.710
<v Speaker 2>behavior so that those basic motivations</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay fulfilled,</v>

739
00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:25.653
<v Speaker 2>so each of the little ovals that make up</v>
<v Speaker 2>that hierarchy have to be organized and </v>

740
00:41:32.441 --> 00:41:35.270
<v Speaker 2>laid out with that set of limitations in</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>

741
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:36.103
<v Speaker 2>But then of course there's a higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>order limitation which is more the one </v>

742
00:41:39.441 --> 00:41:40.274
<v Speaker 2>that piaget talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that not only do you have to </v>

743
00:41:42.561 --> 00:41:43.394
<v Speaker 2>organize your internal hierarchies to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take care of all of your basic </v>

744
00:41:46.611 --> 00:41:48.800
<v Speaker 2>motivations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to do that well.</v>

745
00:41:48.801 --> 00:41:52.250
<v Speaker 2>Everyone else is doing the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so in some sense,</v>

746
00:41:52.251 --> 00:41:53.084
<v Speaker 2>the hypothalamic system that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>generating the impetus for these layers </v>

747
00:41:57.441 --> 00:42:01.940
<v Speaker 2>and layers of motor output also has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do so in a social context.</v>

748
00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:03.200
<v Speaker 2>Because otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

749
00:42:03.201 --> 00:42:05.900
<v Speaker 2>you fight to the death over a stick of </v>
<v Speaker 2>bread,</v>

750
00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:08.360
<v Speaker 2>which seems like a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>counterproductive thing to do.</v>

751
00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:09.733
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to point out to you how many </v>

752
00:42:14.271 --> 00:42:19.271
<v Speaker 2>parameters those that hierarchical </v>
<v Speaker 2>organization has to meet simultaneously.</v>

753
00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:21.763
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the implications of that is that </v>

754
00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:26.420
<v Speaker 2>it's not an arbitrary system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

755
00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:30.680
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the problems I have with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the radical moral relativists stats.</v>

756
00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.210
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

757
00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:33.763
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For you to set up your perceptual and </v>

758
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:37.543
<v Speaker 2>behavioral system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to solve a whole bunch of </v>

759
00:42:40.011 --> 00:42:40.844
<v Speaker 2>problems like in the really complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems and they're in their kind of </v>

760
00:42:42.951 --> 00:42:46.760
<v Speaker 2>arbitrary in some sense like you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>hungry and you need deet.</v>

761
00:42:46.761 --> 00:42:47.594
<v Speaker 2>It's arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what that means is you can't fill </v>

762
00:42:49.761 --> 00:42:52.430
<v Speaker 2>that hierarchy with just any old thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

763
00:42:52.431 --> 00:42:57.380
<v Speaker 2>not only does it have to work to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the complex parts of you functioning</v>

764
00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:01.040
<v Speaker 2>here and now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it has to keep them functioning here</v>

765
00:43:01.041 --> 00:43:01.874
<v Speaker 2>and now in a way that doesn't disturb </v>
<v Speaker 2>them functioning tomorrow or the next </v>

766
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:08.990
<v Speaker 2>day or the next week or the next month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's integration across time spans.</v>

767
00:43:08.991 --> 00:43:10.280
<v Speaker 2>That's a killer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

768
00:43:10.281 --> 00:43:11.114
<v Speaker 2>Because he can't just go out tonight and</v>
<v Speaker 2>drink 40 ounces of vodka and then you </v>

769
00:43:13.551 --> 00:43:15.170
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>write the test on Thursday,</v>

770
00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:20.480
<v Speaker 2>so there's probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So some of you might try so,</v>

771
00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.033
<v Speaker 2>but then you also have to organize your </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior in the here and now with your </v>

772
00:43:26.451 --> 00:43:27.284
<v Speaker 2>behavior spread across timeframes in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>presence of other people who are also </v>

773
00:43:30.891 --> 00:43:33.170
<v Speaker 2>organizing their behavior across </v>
<v Speaker 2>timeframes.</v>

774
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:34.263
<v Speaker 2>It's like once you put that many </v>
<v Speaker 2>parameters on the organization of a </v>

775
00:43:36.471 --> 00:43:37.304
<v Speaker 2>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see right away that it can </v>

776
00:43:39.321 --> 00:43:41.270
<v Speaker 2>hardly be arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

777
00:43:41.271 --> 00:43:44.000
<v Speaker 2>it's tightly constrained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

778
00:43:44.001 --> 00:43:47.180
<v Speaker 2>so here's some basic emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked about basic motivations and so</v>

779
00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:48.523
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the web we're going to do in a simple </v>

780
00:43:49.491 --> 00:43:50.324
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to divide them into two </v>

781
00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:54.080
<v Speaker 2>positive emotions and negative emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

782
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:56.870
<v Speaker 2>And that basically gives you </v>
<v Speaker 2>extroversion and neuroticism.</v>

783
00:43:57.650 --> 00:44:01.760
<v Speaker 2>So positive emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they kind of fall into two classes.</v>

784
00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:07.310
<v Speaker 2>The one class is the positive emotion </v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel when you,</v>

785
00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.850
<v Speaker 2>when you run a motivational frame to its</v>
<v Speaker 2>limit.</v>

786
00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:14.120
<v Speaker 2>So you're hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go have a peanut butter sandwich and</v>

787
00:44:14.121 --> 00:44:15.650
<v Speaker 2>then you're no longer hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

788
00:44:15.651 --> 00:44:20.651
<v Speaker 2>So what's the state?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you define the state after you've</v>

789
00:44:21.201 --> 00:44:23.690
<v Speaker 2>eaten European butter sandwich and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're no longer hungry?</v>

790
00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:26.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

791
00:44:26.061 --> 00:44:26.894
<v Speaker 2>you're not jumping up and down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheering like someone who just made a </v>

792
00:44:28.491 --> 00:44:29.150
<v Speaker 2>touchdown.</v>

793
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.940
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

794
00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:30.773
<v Speaker 2>it's not that kind of positive emotion </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you see when people are </v>

795
00:44:33.661 --> 00:44:35.000
<v Speaker 2>celebrating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

796
00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:35.853
<v Speaker 2>it's more like satisfaction and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually technically what it's known as </v>

797
00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:41.123
<v Speaker 2>satiation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when a motivational routine runs </v>

798
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:48.780
<v Speaker 2>successfully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens is it eliminates,</v>

799
00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:52.410
<v Speaker 2>it eliminates the necessity for it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist temporarily.</v>

800
00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:57.060
<v Speaker 2>So basically what happens is you run a </v>
<v Speaker 2>framework to its logical conclusion,</v>

801
00:44:57.061 --> 00:44:57.894
<v Speaker 2>poof,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it disappears because it's done and you </v>

802
00:44:59.971 --> 00:45:01.890
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might be satisfied about that,</v>

803
00:45:01.891 --> 00:45:02.724
<v Speaker 2>but that's the next thing that happens </v>
<v Speaker 2>is another motivational framework pops </v>

804
00:45:05.641 --> 00:45:06.680
<v Speaker 2>up in your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

805
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:09.510
<v Speaker 2>you're in the same game and sisyphus </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally.</v>

806
00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:13.980
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's satiation.</v>

807
00:45:13.981 --> 00:45:18.981
<v Speaker 2>That is the term satiation is </v>
<v Speaker 2>technically use to describe the state of</v>

808
00:45:20.191 --> 00:45:21.024
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's characteristic of the successful </v>

809
00:45:22.441 --> 00:45:23.274
<v Speaker 2>execution of a motivated frame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also known as consumed matory </v>

810
00:45:26.791 --> 00:45:30.580
<v Speaker 2>reward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>consummation consume.</v>

811
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:35.660
<v Speaker 2>And that's associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconditioned.</v>

812
00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:40.640
<v Speaker 2>That's an unconditioned response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

813
00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:42.920
<v Speaker 2>which means you don't have to learn it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a,</v>

814
00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:46.720
<v Speaker 2>it's an unconditioned positive response,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

815
00:45:46.930 --> 00:45:49.600
<v Speaker 2>and that means that satiating</v>

816
00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:54.990
<v Speaker 2>stimuli when delivered to a creature in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the proper motivational frame,</v>

817
00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:57.360
<v Speaker 2>have the properties of unconditioned </v>
<v Speaker 2>rewards.</v>

818
00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:58.463
<v Speaker 2>So you get three things there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the satiation brings the motor </v>

819
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:01.703
<v Speaker 2>frame motivated frame to an end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The satiation is also known as consumer </v>

820
00:46:04.861 --> 00:46:05.694
<v Speaker 2>Tory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reward Conservatory reward is very </v>

821
00:46:07.381 --> 00:46:12.060
<v Speaker 2>similar to what the behavior is </v>
<v Speaker 2>described as unconditioned reward,</v>

822
00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:14.430
<v Speaker 2>unlearned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can,</v>

823
00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:15.293
<v Speaker 2>you can stack each of those things to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know on top of each other and then </v>

824
00:46:17.521 --> 00:46:18.354
<v Speaker 2>you've got them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other kind of positive emotion is </v>

825
00:46:21.271 --> 00:46:22.104
<v Speaker 2>the positive emotion that you feel when </v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like you might get a </v>

826
00:46:24.211 --> 00:46:25.530
<v Speaker 2>conservatory reward,</v>

827
00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:28.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

828
00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:29.520
<v Speaker 2>Hope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>curiosity,</v>

829
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:31.950
<v Speaker 2>anticipation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excitement,</v>

830
00:46:31.951 --> 00:46:32.784
<v Speaker 2>enthusiasm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the positive emotions that we </v>

831
00:46:34.711 --> 00:46:37.320
<v Speaker 2>think of as really like happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>happy,</v>

832
00:46:37.321 --> 00:46:38.154
<v Speaker 2>usually has to do with evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 2>your pursuit of a valued conservatory </v>

833
00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:45.180
<v Speaker 2>reward is going well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

834
00:46:45.181 --> 00:46:46.014
<v Speaker 2>Now that that's incentive reward and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason it's called incentive reward is </v>

835
00:46:49.591 --> 00:46:50.424
<v Speaker 2>because you're incentivized to move </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward to the reward and the moving </v>

836
00:46:53.671 --> 00:46:54.504
<v Speaker 2>forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the impulse to move forward towards a </v>

837
00:46:56.551 --> 00:46:57.384
<v Speaker 2>desired goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what your positive emotion </v>

838
00:47:00.631 --> 00:47:01.464
<v Speaker 2>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dopaminergic systems that are </v>

839
00:47:02.581 --> 00:47:05.280
<v Speaker 2>nestled have the roots in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamus.</v>

840
00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:10.560
<v Speaker 2>That's what they motivate you to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what positive emotion is.</v>

841
00:47:10.561 --> 00:47:12.810
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally positive emotion is </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something good.</v>

842
00:47:12.811 --> 00:47:15.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the I'm going to go get it.</v>

843
00:47:15.511 --> 00:47:18.540
<v Speaker 2>Part that's associated with excitement </v>
<v Speaker 2>and positive emotion.</v>

844
00:47:18.541 --> 00:47:20.490
<v Speaker 2>It's what do you feel?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're an extrovert.</v>

845
00:47:20.491 --> 00:47:24.060
<v Speaker 2>You want to go to a party and so you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably more excited about going to the</v>

846
00:47:24.061 --> 00:47:24.330
<v Speaker 2>party.</v>

847
00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:26.210
<v Speaker 2>Then you will be when you get there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

848
00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:29.220
<v Speaker 2>because it's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the apprehension of the reward.</v>

849
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:32.020
<v Speaker 2>That's with human beings because we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>such weird creatures.</v>

850
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:34.060
<v Speaker 2>So often the apprehension of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>consumer,</v>

851
00:47:34.061 --> 00:47:39.061
<v Speaker 2>Terry Ward is a more powerful emotion </v>
<v Speaker 2>than the emotion that's actually felt as</v>

852
00:47:39.101 --> 00:47:41.140
<v Speaker 2>a consequence of gaining the reward </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

853
00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:42.813
<v Speaker 2>And that's partly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is where it gets a little more </v>

854
00:47:43.901 --> 00:47:44.734
<v Speaker 2>complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's partly because we're so bloody </v>

855
00:47:46.151 --> 00:47:47.890
<v Speaker 2>exploratory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

856
00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:48.753
<v Speaker 2>So there's things that you can learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that are associated with the </v>

857
00:47:52.301 --> 00:47:56.410
<v Speaker 2>conservatory reward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are conditioned rewards.</v>

858
00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:57.673
<v Speaker 2>So an incentive reward and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditioned reward are in the same </v>

859
00:47:59.981 --> 00:48:00.814
<v Speaker 2>category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although not all incentive rewards are </v>

860
00:48:04.211 --> 00:48:05.044
<v Speaker 2>learned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is where the behaviorists went </v>

861
00:48:05.831 --> 00:48:09.100
<v Speaker 2>wrong because the behaviors thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are consumer metairie rewards.</v>

862
00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:14.280
<v Speaker 2>Those are unconditioned rewards to get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>conditioned to come.</v>

863
00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:17.770
<v Speaker 2>If you condition a stimulus to an </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconditioned reward,</v>

864
00:48:17.771 --> 00:48:21.250
<v Speaker 2>you get a conditioned stimulus with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditioned reward is a response,</v>

865
00:48:21.251 --> 00:48:22.084
<v Speaker 2>but the problem with that line of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking is that there's actually </v>

866
00:48:24.551 --> 00:48:26.320
<v Speaker 2>incentive reward circuitry.</v>

867
00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:27.813
<v Speaker 2>It's not just secondary learning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like incentive rewards have been </v>

868
00:48:30.491 --> 00:48:32.900
<v Speaker 2>around so long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so those are things that indicate that a</v>

869
00:48:32.901 --> 00:48:33.734
<v Speaker 2>consumer story reward is coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've been around so long that your </v>

870
00:48:36.401 --> 00:48:37.234
<v Speaker 2>brain is developed its own circuit for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and that's the one that produces </v>

871
00:48:39.461 --> 00:48:43.480
<v Speaker 2>positive emotion and so that's also </v>
<v Speaker 2>produced by the way,</v>

872
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:44.583
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're taking a drug of some sort </v>

873
00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:47.253
<v Speaker 2>that you really like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's because it's activating this </v>

874
00:48:50.021 --> 00:48:50.854
<v Speaker 2>dopaminergic incentive reward system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you take a drug that activates </v>

875
00:48:54.191 --> 00:48:55.024
<v Speaker 2>conservatory reward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just like lay in front of the fire </v>

876
00:48:56.561 --> 00:48:58.240
<v Speaker 2>like a sleeping dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

877
00:48:58.241 --> 00:49:00.580
<v Speaker 2>it's not exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's cocaine,</v>

878
00:49:00.581 --> 00:49:02.800
<v Speaker 2>amphetamines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alcohol for lots of people,</v>

879
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:03.783
<v Speaker 2>nail the incentive reward system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the dopaminergic exploratory </v>

880
00:49:06.881 --> 00:49:08.830
<v Speaker 2>system that emerges out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamus.</v>

881
00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:09.903
<v Speaker 2>And it's also the thing that learns what</v>
<v Speaker 2>to associate with consumer matory </v>

882
00:49:13.361 --> 00:49:16.180
<v Speaker 2>rewards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I know that's a lot to take in,</v>

883
00:49:16.181 --> 00:49:18.400
<v Speaker 2>but well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>

884
00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:19.930
<v Speaker 2>That's how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

885
00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:26.130
<v Speaker 2>so the approach systems respond to ques </v>
<v Speaker 2>of consumer Tory reward.</v>

886
00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:30.850
<v Speaker 2>And they also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they also respond to a large set of um,</v>

887
00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:34.690
<v Speaker 2>biologically prepared stimuli smells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

888
00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:39.430
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you should approach good things,</v>

889
00:49:39.850 --> 00:49:42.490
<v Speaker 2>but if a bad thing happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what should you do?</v>

890
00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:44.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing you should do is stop.</v>

891
00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:47.290
<v Speaker 2>Another thing you should do is get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell out of there.</v>

892
00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:48.483
<v Speaker 2>So there's a constellation of negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions that are associated with </v>

893
00:49:51.881 --> 00:49:52.714
<v Speaker 2>defense and avoidance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we kind of ran through those </v>

894
00:49:54.611 --> 00:49:55.570
<v Speaker 2>already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pain,</v>

895
00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:56.710
<v Speaker 2>grief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frustration,</v>

896
00:49:56.711 --> 00:49:59.680
<v Speaker 2>disappointment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then fear,</v>

897
00:49:59.681 --> 00:50:04.681
<v Speaker 2>which is sort of what you learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You learn that things to be feared.</v>

898
00:50:05.411 --> 00:50:08.740
<v Speaker 2>Signal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>primary pain stimulus,</v>

899
00:50:09.130 --> 00:50:09.963
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a child is going to be afraid of a </v>

900
00:50:10.631 --> 00:50:11.464
<v Speaker 2>needle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if a child's got a needle </v>

901
00:50:12.401 --> 00:50:15.190
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most children are smart enough to figure</v>

902
00:50:15.191 --> 00:50:17.500
<v Speaker 2>out they should be afraid of the needle </v>
<v Speaker 2>even when they haven't had it,</v>

903
00:50:17.501 --> 00:50:18.334
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is is that if you come </v>
<v Speaker 2>into contact with something that's </v>

904
00:50:21.761 --> 00:50:22.594
<v Speaker 2>already caused you pain and now there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that only signals that that's </v>

905
00:50:26.291 --> 00:50:29.300
<v Speaker 2>likely to happen when you experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>fear,</v>

906
00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:30.590
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

907
00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:31.423
<v Speaker 2>Fear is its own circuit again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is where the behaviors in some </v>

908
00:50:34.341 --> 00:50:35.174
<v Speaker 2>sense wind a little bit wrong too </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they thought of unconditioned </v>

909
00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:38.203
<v Speaker 2>punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which produces pain as the primary </v>

910
00:50:40.731 --> 00:50:43.790
<v Speaker 2>motivational system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it would be unconditioned punishment,</v>

911
00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:47.480
<v Speaker 2>unconditioned reward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there were things you learned about</v>

912
00:50:47.481 --> 00:50:49.250
<v Speaker 2>those that produced conditioned </v>
<v Speaker 2>punishment,</v>

913
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:50.810
<v Speaker 2>conditioned reward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

914
00:50:50.811 --> 00:50:53.480
<v Speaker 2>but all of those have circuits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>independent circuits,</v>

915
00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:54.643
<v Speaker 2>so the defense and avoidance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>negative emotions seem to be roughly </v>

916
00:50:57.771 --> 00:50:59.660
<v Speaker 2>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety and fear.</v>

917
00:50:59.661 --> 00:51:00.494
<v Speaker 2>But then there's discussed and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been looking at discussed a lot </v>

918
00:51:03.321 --> 00:51:05.630
<v Speaker 2>lately and it doesn't load on </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroticism.</v>

919
00:51:05.631 --> 00:51:08.270
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem to load on neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's its own circuit.</v>

920
00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:10.370
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

921
00:51:10.371 --> 00:51:11.204
<v Speaker 2>so here's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other complexity that you need to </v>

922
00:51:14.031 --> 00:51:17.420
<v Speaker 2>grapple with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is there are things that hurt that</v>

923
00:51:17.421 --> 00:51:18.254
<v Speaker 2>caused you pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are things that are satiating and </v>

924
00:51:20.871 --> 00:51:21.704
<v Speaker 2>netter conservatory reward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there are things that signal each </v>

925
00:51:25.281 --> 00:51:28.670
<v Speaker 2>of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's one class of stimuli,</v>

926
00:51:28.671 --> 00:51:30.650
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or things that you're going to encounter</v>

927
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:31.783
<v Speaker 2>that or a paradoxical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the class of things that you </v>

928
00:51:34.101 --> 00:51:35.720
<v Speaker 2>don't understand.</v>

929
00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:40.640
<v Speaker 2>That's novelty and novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's it's novelty itself.</v>

930
00:51:40.641 --> 00:51:44.210
<v Speaker 2>That's sort of associated with what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenologists are primarily concerned</v>

931
00:51:44.211 --> 00:51:46.610
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea of the revelation of meaning,</v>

932
00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:47.683
<v Speaker 2>because the revelation of meaning is </v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly associated with you encountering </v>

933
00:51:51.441 --> 00:51:53.480
<v Speaker 2>something that you haven't already </v>
<v Speaker 2>understood,</v>

934
00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:54.373
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You explore that new information comes </v>

935
00:51:56.211 --> 00:51:57.890
<v Speaker 2>out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a new you comes out of it.</v>

936
00:51:57.891 --> 00:52:00.680
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're going from point a to point b,</v>

937
00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:02.533
<v Speaker 2>what might happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where all things might happen that it </v>

938
00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:08.990
<v Speaker 2>appeared to demonstrate that you're on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the right track,</v>

939
00:52:09.050 --> 00:52:12.110
<v Speaker 2>so that makes you happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the yellow box,</v>

940
00:52:12.111 --> 00:52:14.020
<v Speaker 2>positive emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

941
00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:17.270
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your pathway is being facilitated.</v>

942
00:52:17.271 --> 00:52:19.760
<v Speaker 2>So that's why tools are sort of in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>category.</v>

943
00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:20.773
<v Speaker 2>Or you can be moving towards point b and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get something gets in your way and </v>

944
00:52:24.201 --> 00:52:26.610
<v Speaker 2>that might be something that hurts you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be.</v>

945
00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:29.353
<v Speaker 2>And that would be pain or disappointment</v>
<v Speaker 2>or frustration or grief or something </v>

946
00:52:32.301 --> 00:52:36.560
<v Speaker 2>that signals that you might get hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is threat that produces fear.</v>

947
00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:37.663
<v Speaker 2>And so the positive emotion is moving </v>
<v Speaker 2>you towards the desired goal in the </v>

948
00:52:41.901 --> 00:52:46.901
<v Speaker 2>negative emotion is protecting you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if a negative things happened,</v>

949
00:52:47.791 --> 00:52:48.624
<v Speaker 2>you'll stop and you'll reconfigure the </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior that you're using or the </v>

950
00:52:51.831 --> 00:52:54.410
<v Speaker 2>framework in order to get around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>obstacle and to continue.</v>

951
00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:57.680
<v Speaker 2>Or if it's a bad now fobs to call you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>

952
00:52:57.681 --> 00:52:58.514
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have not.</v>

953
00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:03.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm too tired deet and I'm too hungry to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep.</v>

954
00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:04.700
<v Speaker 2>That happens to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

955
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:09.650
<v Speaker 2>It's a conflict of motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you get up and you go into the</v>

956
00:53:09.651 --> 00:53:11.630
<v Speaker 2>cupboard and you find out there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing to eat,</v>

957
00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:12.471
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

958
00:53:12.471 --> 00:53:14.210
<v Speaker 2>to hell with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'll just go to sleep.</v>

959
00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:16.970
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes the way you solve a problem</v>

960
00:53:16.971 --> 00:53:17.804
<v Speaker 2>is by flipping the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we're not going to solve that </v>

961
00:53:19.311 --> 00:53:21.650
<v Speaker 2>problem right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll turn to another problem some.</v>

962
00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:23.870
<v Speaker 2>And that's an explorer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an exploratory move.</v>

963
00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:27.690
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you within the frame,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you go to the cupboard,</v>

964
00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:31.380
<v Speaker 2>the cupboard is bare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're hungry,</v>

965
00:53:31.381 --> 00:53:34.600
<v Speaker 2>so you walked down to the corner store </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you get something to eat and so that</v>

966
00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:37.860
<v Speaker 2>way you have sort of stayed within the </v>
<v Speaker 2>frame and altered.</v>

967
00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:40.650
<v Speaker 2>You know you've altered your behavior to</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

968
00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:42.993
<v Speaker 2>You've thought up another path and </v>
<v Speaker 2>altered your behavior so that that </v>

969
00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:48.010
<v Speaker 2>motivated state can run to completion.</v>

970
00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:53.113
<v Speaker 2>Here's another way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can be moving from point a to b and </v>

971
00:53:56.870 --> 00:54:01.280
<v Speaker 2>what you predict or want is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good thing that keeps your mood</v>

972
00:54:01.281 --> 00:54:03.820
<v Speaker 2>straight and you happy and that makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>you whoa.</v>

973
00:54:03.850 --> 00:54:04.683
<v Speaker 2>That's a promise with the promises.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get what you want and </v>

974
00:54:07.401 --> 00:54:08.234
<v Speaker 2>that fills you with hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's positive emotion or you can have </v>

975
00:54:10.581 --> 00:54:12.740
<v Speaker 2>an unpredicted outcomes when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

976
00:54:12.741 --> 00:54:16.430
<v Speaker 2>you to know you're supposed to be going </v>
<v Speaker 2>out with your friend,</v>

977
00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:20.390
<v Speaker 2>you go to the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you knock and there's nobody there.</v>

978
00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:22.340
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's up with that?</v>

979
00:54:22.550 --> 00:54:24.260
<v Speaker 2>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a sense when that happens,</v>

980
00:54:24.261 --> 00:54:26.240
<v Speaker 2>there's like a hole in your framework,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

981
00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:29.420
<v Speaker 2>because your framework was predicated on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the presence of your friend,</v>

982
00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:31.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a presupposition.</v>

983
00:54:32.210 --> 00:54:33.043
<v Speaker 2>And so now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you'll run out of behavioral </v>

984
00:54:34.221 --> 00:54:37.960
<v Speaker 2>routine and one of your presuppositions </v>
<v Speaker 2>is wrong and sort of like there's a hole</v>

985
00:54:37.961 --> 00:54:42.961
<v Speaker 2>in your theory and the whole you sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>drop into it and when you drop into that</v>

986
00:54:43.011 --> 00:54:43.844
<v Speaker 2>hole you get anxious because you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know exactly what this unexpected thing </v>

987
00:54:47.901 --> 00:54:52.340
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And behind that you get exploratory.</v>

988
00:54:52.610 --> 00:54:53.780
<v Speaker 2>So with most people</v>

989
00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:55.993
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get afraid first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna have negative emotion </v>

990
00:54:57.391 --> 00:54:58.224
<v Speaker 2>first when they're little plan is blown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if nothing additionally awful </v>

991
00:55:01.491 --> 00:55:02.324
<v Speaker 2>happens and if they don't drive </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves crazy with some hypothesis </v>

992
00:55:05.121 --> 00:55:08.300
<v Speaker 2>about he doesn't like me anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so no one likes me anymore.</v>

993
00:55:08.301 --> 00:55:10.120
<v Speaker 2>So I'm a terrible person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

994
00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:13.460
<v Speaker 2>Then the x,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once they calm down a little bit,</v>

995
00:55:13.461 --> 00:55:17.570
<v Speaker 2>the exploration circuit will come up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they'll walk somewhere else,</v>

996
00:55:17.571 --> 00:55:19.910
<v Speaker 2>go to a bar or maybe they'll stand there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and think,</v>

997
00:55:19.911 --> 00:55:20.690
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

998
00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:22.580
<v Speaker 2>this didn't work out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what else could I do?</v>

999
00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:25.820
<v Speaker 2>And emotionally stable person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say a non neurotic personnel,</v>

1000
00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:26.713
<v Speaker 2>flip to that really fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if they're extroverted and </v>

1001
00:55:28.371 --> 00:55:30.140
<v Speaker 2>open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas someone who's heavy,</v>

1002
00:55:30.141 --> 00:55:30.974
<v Speaker 2>a negative emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the fact that their friend </v>

1003
00:55:32.661 --> 00:55:34.880
<v Speaker 2>wasn't there when they told him they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be.</v>

1004
00:55:34.970 --> 00:55:38.570
<v Speaker 2>That might just produce a hole that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>fall into and it's so deep and painful,</v>

1005
00:55:38.571 --> 00:55:40.850
<v Speaker 2>they just go home and cry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1006
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:41.833
<v Speaker 2>So the neuroticism and the extroversion </v>
<v Speaker 2>are in some sense they vary with the </v>

1007
00:55:46.761 --> 00:55:51.620
<v Speaker 2>degree to which the negative emotion </v>
<v Speaker 2>system is strong or the positive emotion</v>

1008
00:55:51.621 --> 00:55:53.960
<v Speaker 2>system is strong and they're two </v>
<v Speaker 2>different systems.</v>

1009
00:55:54.290 --> 00:55:56.120
<v Speaker 2>And so you can think of them in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

1010
00:55:56.121 --> 00:55:57.110
<v Speaker 2>You can think of them as</v>

1011
00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:03.670
<v Speaker 2>units of positive emotion per unit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>promise.</v>

1012
00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:05.323
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a weird thing to try to </v>

1013
00:56:06.371 --> 00:56:11.140
<v Speaker 2>quantify or units of negative emotion </v>
<v Speaker 2>per unit of threat.</v>

1014
00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:13.360
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone,</v>

1015
00:56:13.690 --> 00:56:15.520
<v Speaker 2>maybe someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a rumor going around that you're</v>

1016
00:56:15.521 --> 00:56:16.354
<v Speaker 2>going to lose your job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well how much should you worry about </v>

1017
00:56:18.311 --> 00:56:19.510
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1018
00:56:19.511 --> 00:56:20.530
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know.</v>

1019
00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:22.210
<v Speaker 2>So how do you decide?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1020
00:56:22.211 --> 00:56:23.100
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1021
00:56:23.730 --> 00:56:26.020
<v Speaker 2>you're wiring decide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're high in negative emotion,</v>

1022
00:56:26.021 --> 00:56:27.850
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get all anxious and </v>
<v Speaker 2>freak out about it,</v>

1023
00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:30.550
<v Speaker 2>which might be the right thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you will lose your job,</v>

1024
00:56:30.970 --> 00:56:33.490
<v Speaker 2>and if you're emotionally stable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to think,</v>

1025
00:56:33.491 --> 00:56:35.890
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably won't lose my job,</v>

1026
00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:37.750
<v Speaker 2>but even if I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if I do,</v>

1027
00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:41.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's innate or lot of it's innate.</v>

1028
00:56:42.130 --> 00:56:42.963
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1029
00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:48.400
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to recapitulate learning theory,</v>

1030
00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:51.730
<v Speaker 2>behaviorism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are unconditioned rewards.</v>

1031
00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:54.790
<v Speaker 2>Those are rewards you don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn.</v>

1032
00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:58.690
<v Speaker 2>Those are the things that bring a </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivated state to its closure,</v>

1033
00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:03.430
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that makes you satisfied satiation.</v>

1034
00:57:03.490 --> 00:57:05.620
<v Speaker 2>That by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is associated with Serotonin.</v>

1035
00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:11.340
<v Speaker 2>Serotonin is a satiating neurochemical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if your levels of Serotonin are high,</v>

1036
00:57:11.770 --> 00:57:12.603
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of satisfied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means you don't experience a lot </v>

1037
00:57:14.591 --> 00:57:16.840
<v Speaker 2>of positive emotion or a lot of negative</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion.</v>

1038
00:57:16.841 --> 00:57:17.674
<v Speaker 2>You're just kind of satisfied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a high dominance thing and it's </v>

1039
00:57:20.081 --> 00:57:23.260
<v Speaker 2>like all the consumer terry rewards are </v>
<v Speaker 2>there when you need them.</v>

1040
00:57:23.650 --> 00:57:26.050
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to worry and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to get too excited.</v>

1041
00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:28.353
<v Speaker 2>Conditioned rewards or incentive rewards</v>
<v Speaker 2>indicate progress towards a consumer to </v>

1042
00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:35.410
<v Speaker 2>consume matory reward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can be learned or conditioned,</v>

1043
00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:36.393
<v Speaker 2>but they can also be a and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with dopaminergic activation </v>

1044
00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:42.520
<v Speaker 2>and that's the exploration circuit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes out of the hypothalamus.</v>

1045
00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:46.060
<v Speaker 2>Half the hymen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hypothalamus does goal specification</v>

1046
00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:50.830
<v Speaker 2>and the other half does exploration and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so again,</v>

1047
00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:55.180
<v Speaker 2>if you're pursuing something that's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>identifiable goal and you fail,</v>

1048
00:57:56.290 --> 00:57:59.020
<v Speaker 2>well then you're going to back off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's negative emotion,</v>

1049
00:57:59.021 --> 00:58:02.440
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to start to explore </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's that dopaminergic circuit.</v>

1050
00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:06.820
<v Speaker 2>What's associated with dopaminergic </v>
<v Speaker 2>activation,</v>

1051
00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:10.900
<v Speaker 2>exploration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extroversion,</v>

1052
00:58:10.901 --> 00:58:13.150
<v Speaker 2>happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>play enthusiasm,</v>

1053
00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:15.910
<v Speaker 2>assertiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the positive element of novelty.</v>

1054
00:58:16.570 --> 00:58:17.920
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that makes sense.</v>

1055
00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:20.860
<v Speaker 2>Anybody have any questions?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that's a lot of information,</v>

1056
00:58:20.861 --> 00:58:21.694
<v Speaker 2>but I kind of designed this part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>course so that at this point the levels </v>

1057
00:58:25.601 --> 00:58:29.350
<v Speaker 2>of analysis would stack up so that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could understand them simultaneously.</v>

1058
00:58:29.890 --> 00:58:34.870
<v Speaker 2>So the hypothalamus sets up your frames </v>
<v Speaker 2>of motivation</v>

1059
00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:39.920
<v Speaker 2>running one of those two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two,</v>

1060
00:58:39.930 --> 00:58:41.370
<v Speaker 2>it's positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conclusion,</v>

1061
00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:44.190
<v Speaker 2>that satisfying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's innate.</v>

1062
00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:46.290
<v Speaker 2>It's concise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's conservatory reward.</v>

1063
00:58:46.291 --> 00:58:47.124
<v Speaker 2>You'll work for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything that indicates that that might </v>

1064
00:58:49.531 --> 00:58:51.840
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's incentive reward.</v>

1065
00:58:51.841 --> 00:58:53.900
<v Speaker 2>You can learn that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some of it's also innate,</v>

1066
00:58:55.050 --> 00:58:58.080
<v Speaker 2>which is where the behaviors didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>that because they thought of all the all</v>

1067
00:58:58.081 --> 00:59:00.690
<v Speaker 2>the secondary stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that condition stuff has learned.</v>

1068
00:59:00.691 --> 00:59:02.790
<v Speaker 2>It's not all learned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of it's already prepared.</v>

1069
00:59:02.970 --> 00:59:05.880
<v Speaker 2>You see a snake that's a threat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to learn that.</v>

1070
00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:11.070
<v Speaker 2>So fire is sort of like that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm blonde is like that.</v>

1071
00:59:11.370 --> 00:59:13.890
<v Speaker 2>Teeth are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Staring eyes are like that.</v>

1072
00:59:13.891 --> 00:59:18.891
<v Speaker 2>Predatory postures are like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>loud,</v>

1073
00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:23.000
<v Speaker 2>loud vocalizations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially if they're like low,</v>

1074
00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:26.840
<v Speaker 2>low in frequency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they indicate a large animal.</v>

1075
00:59:26.841 --> 00:59:27.674
<v Speaker 2>All those things are things you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to learn to be afraid of because </v>

1076
00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:31.273
<v Speaker 2>they've been so consistently dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the past that you've built up a </v>

1077
00:59:33.861 --> 00:59:36.560
<v Speaker 2>circuit that aren't responds </v>
<v Speaker 2>automatically to the question</v>

1078
00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:43.540
<v Speaker 3>extraversion then it seems like there </v>
<v Speaker 3>will at least that usually.</v>

1079
00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:49.220
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I mean?</v>

1080
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:50.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's complicated,</v>

1081
00:59:50.541 --> 00:59:51.374
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they do play a bit of an </v>

1082
00:59:52.521 --> 00:59:54.800
<v Speaker 2>inhibitory rule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're separate circuits,</v>

1083
00:59:55.450 --> 00:59:56.283
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can be very extroverted and very </v>

1084
00:59:58.010 --> 01:00:00.290
<v Speaker 2>high in negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1085
01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:06.050
<v Speaker 2>And you can be very emotionally stable </v>
<v Speaker 2>and very low in extroversion too.</v>

1086
01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:07.333
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are definitely separate things </v>

1087
01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:09.500
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard,</v>

1088
01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:10.333
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can flip from laughing to crying </v>

1089
01:00:11.781 --> 01:00:13.580
<v Speaker 2>very rapidly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1090
01:00:13.581 --> 01:00:14.414
<v Speaker 2>so people are very much capable </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiencing mixed states of positive </v>

1091
01:00:17.481 --> 01:00:20.660
<v Speaker 2>and negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus there are forms of manic depressive</v>

1092
01:00:20.661 --> 01:00:23.570
<v Speaker 2>disorder where people are manic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed at the same time,</v>

1093
01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:26.900
<v Speaker 2>which I would recommend the people I </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that have had that.</v>

1094
01:00:26.901 --> 01:00:29.120
<v Speaker 2>They seem to think that is certainly not</v>
<v Speaker 2>fun.</v>

1095
01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:33.740
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>agitation,</v>

1096
01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:35.653
<v Speaker 2>tremendous agitation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're probably sort of like that when </v>

1097
01:00:38.481 --> 01:00:39.314
<v Speaker 2>you're deeply confused and you're really</v>
<v Speaker 2>bothered by it because then the threads </v>

1098
01:00:42.141 --> 01:00:44.570
<v Speaker 2>circuits are going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're also sort of wandering around</v>

1099
01:00:44.571 --> 01:00:44.991
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1100
01:00:44.991 --> 01:00:45.950
<v Speaker 2>what am I going to do?</v>

1101
01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:47.870
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>

1102
01:00:48.090 --> 01:00:52.280
<v Speaker 2>Like approach behavior approach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Motivation isn't always positive A.</v>

1103
01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:53.203
<v Speaker 2>I mean most of the time it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but intensity measures and </v>

1104
01:00:55.731 --> 01:00:59.290
<v Speaker 2>controllability matters too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so okay.</v>

1105
01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:05.060
<v Speaker 2>Unconditioned punishments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally they produce pain.</v>

1106
01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:06.133
<v Speaker 2>They also tend to ha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you run a behavioral routine or a </v>

1107
01:01:10.911 --> 01:01:14.660
<v Speaker 2>motivated framework that results in </v>
<v Speaker 2>punishment,</v>

1108
01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:17.420
<v Speaker 2>you're less likely to run it again in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the future.</v>

1109
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:18.343
<v Speaker 2>That's learning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you run a motivated frame and it </v>

1110
01:01:20.721 --> 01:01:21.554
<v Speaker 2>works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're more likely to run it in the </v>

1111
01:01:22.161 --> 01:01:25.760
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's learning to sew.</v>

1112
01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:30.170
<v Speaker 2>Unconditioned punishments decrease the </v>
<v Speaker 2>probability that you're going to run and</v>

1113
01:01:30.171 --> 01:01:32.740
<v Speaker 2>given motivational frame because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>failed,</v>

1114
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:34.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ran out and you got hurt?</v>

1115
01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:35.713
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't do that again as part of the </v>

1116
01:01:37.221 --> 01:01:40.370
<v Speaker 2>purpose of memory and the pain like </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions,</v>

1117
01:01:40.371 --> 01:01:42.080
<v Speaker 2>just to say it again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our pain,</v>

1118
01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:44.270
<v Speaker 2>frustration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disappointment,</v>

1119
01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.970
<v Speaker 2>grief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sadness is in there as well,</v>

1120
01:01:47.090 --> 01:01:49.190
<v Speaker 2>so those are paying like states of </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion,</v>

1121
01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:51.620
<v Speaker 2>conditioned punishments.</v>

1122
01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:55.250
<v Speaker 2>Those are things that indicate that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>punishment is likely.</v>

1123
01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:57.013
<v Speaker 2>Some of them you can learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them you don't have to because </v>

1124
01:01:59.211 --> 01:02:00.044
<v Speaker 2>they're already built into you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The negative emotions are dampened by </v>

1125
01:02:03.381 --> 01:02:06.620
<v Speaker 2>Serotonin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the fundamental brain system.</v>

1126
01:02:06.621 --> 01:02:07.454
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the serotonergic system is like a </v>

1127
01:02:09.051 --> 01:02:09.884
<v Speaker 2>conductor of the orchestra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It keeps everything in balance and </v>

1128
01:02:13.431 --> 01:02:16.700
<v Speaker 2>Gabba.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gabba is a anxie.</v>

1129
01:02:16.701 --> 01:02:20.370
<v Speaker 2>Lytic makes people less anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's your brain produces it.</v>

1130
01:02:20.850 --> 01:02:21.683
<v Speaker 2>If you take valium or barbiturates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they act on the Gaba system and so does </v>

1131
01:02:26.101 --> 01:02:26.934
<v Speaker 2>alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the reason why people </v>

1132
01:02:28.501 --> 01:02:31.440
<v Speaker 2>like alcohol because it dampens anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now for some people,</v>

1133
01:02:31.441 --> 01:02:34.620
<v Speaker 2>alcohol or also produces dopaminergic </v>
<v Speaker 2>activation,</v>

1134
01:02:35.010 --> 01:02:39.360
<v Speaker 2>so they really like alcohol because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>calms them down like they're not anxious</v>

1135
01:02:39.361 --> 01:02:40.194
<v Speaker 2>anymore and it it also feels produces </v>
<v Speaker 2>incentive reward activation like </v>

1136
01:02:44.491 --> 01:02:47.430
<v Speaker 2>cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for some people alcohol is absolutely</v>

1137
01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:48.264
<v Speaker 2>deadly drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can probably find out if you're </v>

1138
01:02:50.491 --> 01:02:54.000
<v Speaker 2>susceptible to alcoholism quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>straightforwardly.</v>

1139
01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:57.810
<v Speaker 2>If you want to find out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sit in a bar,</v>

1140
01:02:58.140 --> 01:02:58.980
<v Speaker 2>take your pulse</v>

1141
01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:02.210
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five shots,</v>

1142
01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:05.060
<v Speaker 2>four shots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're little,</v>

1143
01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:06.523
<v Speaker 2>you got to get your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to get your blood alcohol level </v>

1144
01:03:08.001 --> 01:03:08.834
<v Speaker 2>above legal intoxication or you won't be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to tell and then take your pulse </v>

1145
01:03:11.571 --> 01:03:15.410
<v Speaker 2>again 10 minutes later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If your pulse has gone up eight beats or</v>

1146
01:03:15.411 --> 01:03:16.244
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch it because you're probably </v>

1147
01:03:18.501 --> 01:03:19.334
<v Speaker 2>producing an opiate response to alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Secondary consequences of the opiate </v>

1148
01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:24.350
<v Speaker 2>responses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dopaminergic response,</v>

1149
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:25.543
<v Speaker 2>reasonable probability that you'll like </v>
<v Speaker 2>alcohol enough to find it difficult to </v>

1150
01:03:28.851 --> 01:03:30.470
<v Speaker 2>stop drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you start,</v>

1151
01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:32.000
<v Speaker 2>some of you are probably like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1152
01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:33.860
<v Speaker 2>You have a few drinks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like yeehaw.</v>

1153
01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:36.410
<v Speaker 2>That's how we do it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Berta.</v>

1154
01:03:36.411 --> 01:03:37.670
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1155
01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:39.673
<v Speaker 2>so part of that is killing the incentive</v>
<v Speaker 2>reward system and because it's an </v>

1156
01:03:42.231 --> 01:03:45.650
<v Speaker 2>approach system and it's being queued by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the alcohol,</v>

1157
01:03:45.651 --> 01:03:46.484
<v Speaker 2>you just continue to hit it and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dopamine kicks only occur as your blood </v>

1158
01:03:51.801 --> 01:03:55.550
<v Speaker 2>alcohol level is rising,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have to keep nailing it,</v>

1159
01:03:55.850 --> 01:03:58.880
<v Speaker 2>nailing yourself with alcohol because </v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise your blood alcohol level won't</v>

1160
01:03:58.881 --> 01:03:59.714
<v Speaker 2>keep rising and you won't get that nice </v>
<v Speaker 2>enthusiasm and assertiveness that goes </v>

1161
01:04:03.231 --> 01:04:06.380
<v Speaker 2>along with a pause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Development of alcohol,</v>

1162
01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:10.880
<v Speaker 2>neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is the neuroticism dimension.</v>

1163
01:04:12.770 --> 01:04:15.230
<v Speaker 2>There's a gender difference in </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroticism.</v>

1164
01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:18.050
<v Speaker 2>Women are about half a standard </v>
<v Speaker 2>deviation,</v>

1165
01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:19.033
<v Speaker 2>higher negative emotion than men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's seems like a cross cultural </v>

1166
01:04:22.461 --> 01:04:23.294
<v Speaker 2>universal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The differences more enhanced and </v>

1167
01:04:25.251 --> 01:04:26.084
<v Speaker 2>egalitarian states like Scandinavia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is exactly the opposite of what </v>

1168
01:04:29.691 --> 01:04:30.620
<v Speaker 2>you'd presume,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1169
01:04:30.621 --> 01:04:33.890
<v Speaker 2>If you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say as a radical,</v>

1170
01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:36.953
<v Speaker 2>can't remember the name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you are someone who believes that </v>

1171
01:04:38.601 --> 01:04:40.940
<v Speaker 2>everything occurs as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>socialization,</v>

1172
01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:42.073
<v Speaker 2>as you equalize the society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gender differences in personality </v>

1173
01:04:45.201 --> 01:04:49.910
<v Speaker 2>become larger rather than smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So which is not what anybody expected.</v>

1174
01:04:49.911 --> 01:04:53.660
<v Speaker 2>But that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So boys and girls seem to have about the</v>

1175
01:04:53.661 --> 01:04:56.690
<v Speaker 2>same level of negative emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as puberty hits,</v>

1176
01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:59.960
<v Speaker 2>women become higher negative emotion </v>
<v Speaker 2>than men on average.</v>

1177
01:04:59.961 --> 01:05:04.160
<v Speaker 2>There's still a lot of overlap between </v>
<v Speaker 2>the genders and it never goes away again</v>

1178
01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:05.503
<v Speaker 2>across the life course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once it kicks in in puberty and the </v>

1179
01:05:07.311 --> 01:05:09.920
<v Speaker 2>reasons for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women are smaller,</v>

1180
01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:13.040
<v Speaker 2>they're their upper bodies are weaker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're more physical.</v>

1181
01:05:13.090 --> 01:05:15.080
<v Speaker 2>They're there at a physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>disadvantage.</v>

1182
01:05:15.081 --> 01:05:18.250
<v Speaker 2>If they're in a dominance dispute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're sexually vulnerable,</v>

1183
01:05:18.550 --> 01:05:19.383
<v Speaker 2>plus they have to take care of infants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think those four things are </v>

1184
01:05:22.181 --> 01:05:23.014
<v Speaker 2>probably enough to tilt the nervous </v>
<v Speaker 2>system of women more towards negative </v>

1185
01:05:27.070 --> 01:05:27.903
<v Speaker 2>negative emotion.</v>

1186
01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:31.450
<v Speaker 2>I've often thought maybe that women's </v>
<v Speaker 2>named emotional systems,</v>

1187
01:05:31.451 --> 01:05:35.260
<v Speaker 2>the negative ones in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are actually not tuned to the woman.</v>

1188
01:05:35.950 --> 01:05:38.710
<v Speaker 2>I think there are tuned to the woman </v>
<v Speaker 2>infant combination.</v>

1189
01:05:39.490 --> 01:05:42.130
<v Speaker 2>So it'd be good if you think about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>from an.</v>

1190
01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:43.053
<v Speaker 2>If you think about it for baited,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it almost has to be that way because an </v>

1191
01:05:45.671 --> 01:05:48.250
<v Speaker 2>infant has to be carried around for like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year and a half.</v>

1192
01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:49.413
<v Speaker 2>And so at that point when you have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>incident and maybe you're going to have </v>

1193
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:53.780
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1194
01:05:53.781 --> 01:05:55.930
<v Speaker 2>you guys won't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the evolutionary past,</v>

1195
01:05:55.931 --> 01:05:56.764
<v Speaker 2>that would have been the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have an infant for much of your </v>

1196
01:05:58.601 --> 01:06:00.400
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you'd be a grandmother and have</v>

1197
01:06:00.401 --> 01:06:01.690
<v Speaker 2>an incident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1198
01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:03.273
<v Speaker 2>why wouldn't your nervous system be </v>
<v Speaker 2>tuned at puberty for the two of you </v>

1199
01:06:06.161 --> 01:06:08.720
<v Speaker 2>instead of one of you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how will,</v>

1200
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:11.230
<v Speaker 2>how could it be any other way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways?</v>

1201
01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:13.593
<v Speaker 2>So you've got your hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then on top of that you've got some </v>

1202
01:06:16.211 --> 01:06:17.950
<v Speaker 2>circuits that deal with memory and </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion.</v>

1203
01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:18.813
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to run you through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hippocampus and the Amygdala relatively </v>

1204
01:06:20.981 --> 01:06:21.814
<v Speaker 2>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is a theory that was basically </v>

1205
01:06:23.351 --> 01:06:27.760
<v Speaker 2>put together by Sokolov was Russian </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuropsychologist back in 1962.</v>

1206
01:06:27.761 --> 01:06:28.594
<v Speaker 2>But it's a variant of a theory that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Norbert Wiener developed back in the </v>

1207
01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:32.710
<v Speaker 2>forties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's the idea.</v>

1208
01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:38.020
<v Speaker 2>You wander through the world and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're in a place that you know</v>

1209
01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:41.353
<v Speaker 2>your memory systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hippa campus looks inside your </v>

1210
01:06:45.271 --> 01:06:46.104
<v Speaker 2>memory systems to see what it is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to have happen based on your </v>

1211
01:06:51.331 --> 01:06:53.670
<v Speaker 2>understanding of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1212
01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:56.910
<v Speaker 2>so</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in a motivated state,</v>

1213
01:06:56.911 --> 01:07:00.450
<v Speaker 2>but you have certain expectations that </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes sense within that state,</v>

1214
01:07:00.451 --> 01:07:03.660
<v Speaker 2>so the hippocampus is watching what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think is going to happen,</v>

1215
01:07:03.661 --> 01:07:05.190
<v Speaker 2>but remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's motivated.</v>

1216
01:07:05.191 --> 01:07:06.024
<v Speaker 2>It's not just expectation and then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hippocampus is also looking at the </v>

1217
01:07:09.811 --> 01:07:10.644
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1218
01:07:12.770 --> 01:07:13.603
<v Speaker 2>Now it's looking at it interpretation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world because you can't help but </v>

1219
01:07:17.811 --> 01:07:18.644
<v Speaker 2>interpret the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but fundamentally the hippocampus is </v>

1220
01:07:20.181 --> 01:07:21.014
<v Speaker 2>looking inside you and outside you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then it seeing if what's happening </v>

1221
01:07:25.131 --> 01:07:28.160
<v Speaker 2>inside and what's happening outside are </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same,</v>

1222
01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:29.503
<v Speaker 2>which means you know what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know where you are and if </v>

1223
01:07:32.931 --> 01:07:35.060
<v Speaker 2>they're the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if it detects a match,</v>

1224
01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:36.193
<v Speaker 2>then the hippocampus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the inhibits the Amygdala and the </v>

1225
01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:41.570
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roughly speaking.</v>

1226
01:07:41.571 --> 01:07:42.404
<v Speaker 2>Now what it actually seems to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a little circuit in your brain </v>

1227
01:07:45.021 --> 01:07:45.854
<v Speaker 2>stem called the reticular activating </v>
<v Speaker 2>circuit and it's the thing that turns </v>

1228
01:07:48.111 --> 01:07:48.944
<v Speaker 2>your brain on at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're sleeping and you hear a noise </v>

1229
01:07:50.871 --> 01:07:52.340
<v Speaker 2>that you shouldn't hear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like bang.</v>

1230
01:07:52.341 --> 01:07:54.770
<v Speaker 2>You're awake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the reticular activating system way</v>

1231
01:07:54.771 --> 01:07:55.604
<v Speaker 2>down in your brainstem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>puts your cortex into a high arousal </v>

1232
01:07:59.751 --> 01:08:01.280
<v Speaker 2>state and Poof,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're conscious.</v>

1233
01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:02.533
<v Speaker 2>Now the hippocampus tells the reticular </v>
<v Speaker 2>activating system to basically remain </v>

1234
01:08:07.161 --> 01:08:07.994
<v Speaker 2>calm as well as as long as what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>expecting and desiring and what's </v>

1235
01:08:13.521 --> 01:08:14.660
<v Speaker 2>happening are the same thing.</v>

1236
01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:15.763
<v Speaker 2>So it's sort of like it's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you could jump up and freak out </v>

1237
01:08:18.501 --> 01:08:19.334
<v Speaker 2>and run about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have to right now because </v>

1238
01:08:20.721 --> 01:08:24.260
<v Speaker 2>everything is going according to plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as soon as there's a deviation,</v>

1239
01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:27.020
<v Speaker 2>that's an normally say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the hippocampus says,</v>

1240
01:08:27.021 --> 01:08:29.450
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something's wrong here.</v>

1241
01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:34.610
<v Speaker 2>And it inhibits the reticular activating</v>
<v Speaker 2>system that turns on your emotions,</v>

1242
01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:35.444
<v Speaker 2>especially your negative emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it primes your positive emotion and </v>

1243
01:08:38.151 --> 01:08:40.980
<v Speaker 2>it prime some of the hypothalamic </v>
<v Speaker 2>circuits to or disinhibit stuff.</v>

1244
01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:41.853
<v Speaker 2>Because one way of solving the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 2>something isn't going well is to switch </v>

1245
01:08:45.831 --> 01:08:46.664
<v Speaker 2>to something else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's sort of like as a bunch of </v>

1246
01:08:49.551 --> 01:08:50.384
<v Speaker 2>circuits on underneath you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're being held back like race </v>

1247
01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:54.253
<v Speaker 2>horses and race horse and then something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you don't expect happens in the </v>

1248
01:08:58.510 --> 01:09:00.860
<v Speaker 2>gates come up a little bit because then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're prepared.</v>

1249
01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:02.750
<v Speaker 2>Now a lot of that's negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1250
01:09:02.751 --> 01:09:04.550
<v Speaker 2>you don't know where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot,</v>

1251
01:09:04.570 --> 01:09:05.403
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the rest of it is be prepared </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do whatever the hell you might need </v>

1252
01:09:07.851 --> 01:09:09.380
<v Speaker 2>to do next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1253
01:09:09.381 --> 01:09:12.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>normally the hippocampus detects it.</v>

1254
01:09:12.801 --> 01:09:14.780
<v Speaker 2>Normally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something unexpected.</v>

1255
01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:18.560
<v Speaker 2>And then a disinhibitor to your lower </v>
<v Speaker 2>circuitry and it gets you ready to go.</v>

1256
01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:20.660
<v Speaker 2>Now the problem is</v>

1257
01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:25.290
<v Speaker 2>how worried should you be when something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you don't expect happens?</v>

1258
01:09:26.710 --> 01:09:27.543
<v Speaker 2>An answer to that is you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a big problem with life because </v>

1259
01:09:30.850 --> 01:09:33.910
<v Speaker 2>now something went wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the possibilities.</v>

1260
01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:35.920
<v Speaker 2>You're not looking at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1261
01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:38.350
<v Speaker 2>So it's actually a perceptual problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1262
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:40.870
<v Speaker 2>Like gray,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1263
01:09:40.871 --> 01:09:41.704
<v Speaker 2>believes that you just see the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like it is because he's sort of a </v>

1264
01:09:43.691 --> 01:09:45.340
<v Speaker 2>behaviorist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's full of stimuli.</v>

1265
01:09:45.341 --> 01:09:47.230
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to interpret them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's wrong.</v>

1266
01:09:47.231 --> 01:09:49.510
<v Speaker 2>You have to interpret them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if something goes wrong,</v>

1267
01:09:49.511 --> 01:09:51.490
<v Speaker 2>it might be that you're looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>things wrong.</v>

1268
01:09:51.970 --> 01:09:54.250
<v Speaker 2>Your perceptual systems are out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's unlikely,</v>

1269
01:09:54.251 --> 01:09:57.610
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but forget that.</v>

1270
01:09:57.611 --> 01:09:58.444
<v Speaker 2>Let's say that you're looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world correctly and you know your </v>

1271
01:10:01.091 --> 01:10:05.500
<v Speaker 2>inferences about what went wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what went wrong isn't the consequence of</v>

1272
01:10:05.530 --> 01:10:06.363
<v Speaker 2>you misperceiving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a consequence of some stupid </v>

1273
01:10:09.670 --> 01:10:10.503
<v Speaker 2>problem with your stupid plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is you don't know where the </v>

1274
01:10:13.721 --> 01:10:18.721
<v Speaker 2>error is located and that's why I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's temperament.</v>

1275
01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:22.600
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes if something unexpected </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>

1276
01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:26.350
<v Speaker 2>you should really freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other times you should ignore it,</v>

1277
01:10:26.710 --> 01:10:29.170
<v Speaker 2>but you can't tell which of those is </v>
<v Speaker 2>true right away.</v>

1278
01:10:29.230 --> 01:10:30.063
<v Speaker 2>So what happens is there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution with a little thing </v>

1279
01:10:32.231 --> 01:10:33.064
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people really get upset about it </v>

1280
01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:35.673
<v Speaker 2>and other people hardly care at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes the people who get really </v>

1281
01:10:38.321 --> 01:10:39.154
<v Speaker 2>upset about it or write and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who don't care at all our </v>

1282
01:10:41.531 --> 01:10:42.364
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why there's variability in </v>

1283
01:10:43.781 --> 01:10:44.614
<v Speaker 2>neuroticism.</v>

1284
01:10:45.970 --> 01:10:48.790
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what you do when you're exploring is</v>

1285
01:10:48.791 --> 01:10:50.920
<v Speaker 2>you start to decompose your plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1286
01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:51.641
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

1287
01:10:51.641 --> 01:10:52.930
<v Speaker 2>if you can manage it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not.</v>

1288
01:10:52.931 --> 01:10:55.870
<v Speaker 2>So like grip my anxiety that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>paralyzed.</v>

1289
01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:57.640
<v Speaker 2>Then you go into your plan and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

1290
01:10:57.641 --> 01:10:59.920
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I a complete loser?</v>

1291
01:11:00.010 --> 01:11:01.960
<v Speaker 2>Or is it some micro thing that's gone </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong?</v>

1292
01:11:01.961 --> 01:11:04.750
<v Speaker 2>And then you can start to decompose it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and reconstruct your plant.</v>

1293
01:11:05.170 --> 01:11:08.170
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1294
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:11.890
<v Speaker 2>the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other thing that this little diagram</v>

1295
01:11:11.891 --> 01:11:13.230
<v Speaker 2>helps you understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1296
01:11:13.231 --> 01:11:15.930
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens is when you're laying out a</v>

1297
01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:17.250
<v Speaker 2>plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a motivated plan,</v>

1298
01:11:17.370 --> 01:11:18.203
<v Speaker 2>and the hole appears in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to figure out why you fell in </v>

1299
01:11:20.431 --> 01:11:22.140
<v Speaker 2>the hole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what you have to do is you have</v>

1300
01:11:22.141 --> 01:11:22.974
<v Speaker 2>to take that motivated plan that's kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of running on automatic and you have to </v>

1301
01:11:26.311 --> 01:11:27.630
<v Speaker 2>remember what it's made out of.</v>

1302
01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:29.153
<v Speaker 2>And so what opens up underneath you when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've made a mistake is the complexity </v>

1303
01:11:32.491 --> 01:11:35.760
<v Speaker 2>of the plant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then also potentially the complexity</v>

1304
01:11:35.761 --> 01:11:38.400
<v Speaker 2>of the world on the off chance that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've misperceived it,</v>

1305
01:11:38.401 --> 01:11:39.180
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just,</v>

1306
01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:42.000
<v Speaker 2>someone might say you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding me properly,</v>

1307
01:11:42.570 --> 01:11:43.403
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe there's something wrong with you </v>

1308
01:11:43.981 --> 01:11:44.814
<v Speaker 2>that's interfering with the perception </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you have to do this massive </v>

1309
01:11:47.191 --> 01:11:49.560
<v Speaker 2>search to try to figure out where there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are lies.</v>

1310
01:11:50.010 --> 01:11:52.980
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason I believe that people</v>

1311
01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:53.873
<v Speaker 2>stick to their beliefs so hard is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because people don't like it when the </v>

1312
01:11:57.091 --> 01:11:59.820
<v Speaker 2>hole appears in one of their big </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstractions,</v>

1313
01:12:00.210 --> 01:12:01.043
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they've got these high order </v>

1314
01:12:01.771 --> 01:12:02.604
<v Speaker 2>representations of the world that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>shorthand ways of representing </v>

1315
01:12:05.161 --> 01:12:07.530
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're sort of like axioms of faith.</v>

1316
01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:08.873
<v Speaker 2>And if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a hole appears in one of the axioms </v>

1317
01:12:10.801 --> 01:12:11.634
<v Speaker 2>of faith,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then all this complexity comes rushing </v>

1318
01:12:13.351 --> 01:12:18.351
<v Speaker 2>up and it's overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so people hate it when you undermine</v>

1319
01:12:19.290 --> 01:12:22.830
<v Speaker 2>one of their high order abstractions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think I told you this before,</v>

1320
01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:25.020
<v Speaker 2>don't do that in relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1321
01:12:25.021 --> 01:12:26.940
<v Speaker 2>It's best not to do it to yourself as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1322
01:12:27.690 --> 01:12:32.640
<v Speaker 2>I'll start with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are Medusa's and what happens when</v>

1323
01:12:32.641 --> 01:12:35.200
<v Speaker 2>you see the Medusa?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1324
01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:36.720
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what might that mean?</v>

1325
01:12:39.630 --> 01:12:43.590
<v Speaker 2>You Bet it's a prey response and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of,</v>

1326
01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.230
<v Speaker 2>that's the sort of thing that occurs </v>
<v Speaker 2>when</v>

1327
01:12:47.850 --> 01:12:52.050
<v Speaker 2>you're moving towards your goal in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>frame and the bottom drops out.</v>

1328
01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:52.711
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1329
01:12:52.711 --> 01:12:55.650
<v Speaker 2>what's there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>

1330
01:12:56.250 --> 01:12:58.650
<v Speaker 2>So what's the logical first response?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1331
01:12:58.651 --> 01:13:00.360
<v Speaker 2>if you're high in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be this,</v>

1332
01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:01.423
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freeze,</v>

1333
01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:02.753
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and only then if nothing else terrible </v>

1334
01:13:05.581 --> 01:13:06.414
<v Speaker 2>happens to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll start to relax a bit and then </v>

1335
01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:08.873
<v Speaker 2>maybe you'll start to investigate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure of your plan and maybe you'll </v>

1336
01:13:11.041 --> 01:13:12.810
<v Speaker 2>start to investigate the structure of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

1337
01:13:13.170 --> 01:13:15.540
<v Speaker 2>And then from a constructivist </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

1338
01:13:15.541 --> 01:13:17.010
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you start to do that,</v>

1339
01:13:17.130 --> 01:13:17.963
<v Speaker 2>you gather information from the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you remake your plan and you </v>

1340
01:13:21.211 --> 01:13:23.850
<v Speaker 2>remake your conception of the world and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you could move on.</v>

1341
01:13:24.570 --> 01:13:28.410
<v Speaker 2>So you do that under the guidance of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive and the negative emotions.</v>

1342
01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:29.700
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>

1343
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:31.920
<v Speaker 2>We'll see you Tuesday.</v>
