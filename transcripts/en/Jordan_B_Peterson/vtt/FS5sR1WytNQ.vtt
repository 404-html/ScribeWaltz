1
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.480
<v Speaker 1>So our next speaker certainly does not </v>
<v Speaker 1>need any introduction.</v>

2
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:09.763
<v Speaker 1>He is the man you cornered by his seat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is the man you cornered in the foyer </v>

3
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.640
<v Speaker 1>and he is the man you cornered outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bathroom.</v>

4
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.990
<v Speaker 1>So please put your hands together for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Peterson.</v>

5
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.030
<v Speaker 1>So I was kind of perplexed about what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to say today because I'm not a</v>

6
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:44.610
<v Speaker 1>media expert by any stretch of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

7
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.473
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.673
<v Speaker 1>I was speaking with Jonathan Patio this </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning because he's staying in the </v>

9
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.020
<v Speaker 1>same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same airbnb is my wife and I,</v>

10
00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:57.021
<v Speaker 1>and he suggested that I talk to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>about my experiences with media over the</v>

11
00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.221
<v Speaker 1>last year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

12
00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:02.370
<v Speaker 1>well that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something I know about.</v>

13
00:01:02.371 --> 00:01:03.204
<v Speaker 1>So it's always good when you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>to people to talk to some talk about </v>

14
00:01:06.301 --> 00:01:07.134
<v Speaker 1>something that you know about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually a really good tip for </v>

15
00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:10.710
<v Speaker 1>public speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

16
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really true.</v>

17
00:01:12.721 --> 00:01:16.020
<v Speaker 1>You have to remember that you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>know about three times as much about the</v>

18
00:01:16.021 --> 00:01:19.860
<v Speaker 1>topic as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you need to talk about the topic.</v>

19
00:01:19.861 --> 00:01:21.780
<v Speaker 1>And then you have places you can go and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:24.900
<v Speaker 1>you can wander round a little bit and be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little spontaneous.</v>

21
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.300
<v Speaker 1>So that's really useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

22
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.163
<v Speaker 1>but then I also thought that makes sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>because nobody knows anything about the </v>

23
00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:36.000
<v Speaker 1>situation with regards to the media now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're all feeling our way.</v>

24
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.133
<v Speaker 1>And so because the technological </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformations are so rapid and you </v>

25
00:01:40.261 --> 00:01:41.094
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to come one after the </v>

26
00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:44.880
<v Speaker 1>other in the next 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we can even imagine what's</v>

27
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:48.270
<v Speaker 1>coming down the pipes and we're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggling to keep up.</v>

28
00:01:48.271 --> 00:01:49.104
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't even know how much of the </v>

29
00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:51.234
<v Speaker 1>current state of more radical political </v>
<v Speaker 1>polarization is actually a secondary </v>

30
00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:55.614
<v Speaker 1>consequence of technological </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformations that we don't </v>

31
00:01:57.571 --> 00:01:59.910
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I was thinking today about,</v>

32
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.403
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about facebook and about twitter and </v>

33
00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:06.150
<v Speaker 1>about youtube and about the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are in an echo chamber.</v>

34
00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:08.370
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not really sure that's the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphor.</v>

35
00:02:08.371 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Speaker 1>I think we might be in an amplifier </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than an echo chamber.</v>

36
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.683
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've thought for a long time that </v>

37
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.313
<v Speaker 1>when I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm thinking about the effect of </v>

38
00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:18.084
<v Speaker 1>the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read something that Solzhenitsyn said </v>

39
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.990
<v Speaker 1>at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think he was citing a,</v>

40
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.183
<v Speaker 1>an ancient Christian theologian who </v>
<v Speaker 1>defined the universe as a place that's </v>

41
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.260
<v Speaker 1>whose circumference was nowhere and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whose center was everywhere.</v>

42
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.880
<v Speaker 1>And I really liked that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

43
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.300
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's actually relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>true from a technical perspective,</v>

44
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.283
<v Speaker 1>like from a physical perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Solzhenitsyn pointed out that each </v>

45
00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:44.050
<v Speaker 1>of us was to be regarded as a center of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Cosmos and,</v>

46
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.740
<v Speaker 1>and that we have the power that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with that.</v>

47
00:02:46.741 --> 00:02:47.574
<v Speaker 1>And I've thought about that a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's something about it </v>

48
00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:50.140
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

49
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:51.683
<v Speaker 1>it's either obviously true or it's true </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough so that we all acted out when we </v>

50
00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:56.124
<v Speaker 1>interact with each other because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>treat each other like conscious beings </v>

51
00:02:58.501 --> 00:02:59.334
<v Speaker 1>who have a destiny and hand who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>choices and who make choices that are </v>

52
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:06.400
<v Speaker 1>important and who make choices that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be good or bad or even good and evil.</v>

53
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.050
<v Speaker 1>We all act like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

54
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>we act that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking that you can think of</v>

55
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:14.290
<v Speaker 1>network models in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

56
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:15.463
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think of human beings as like 9 </v>

57
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 1>billion dots in a row and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>connections between the dots.</v>

58
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:21.544
<v Speaker 1>And then you're sorta like a dust mote </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the wind and who the hell cares what </v>

59
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>you think anyways and you don't have any</v>
<v Speaker 1>impact on things.</v>

60
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:27.814
<v Speaker 1>Or you can recognize that you're at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>center of a network system and that you </v>

61
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:32.374
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know a thousand people or you will </v>

62
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:34.414
<v Speaker 1>in your lifetime or perhaps more than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand people and then they know a </v>

63
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.283
<v Speaker 1>thousand people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're separated by one person from </v>

64
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:43.930
<v Speaker 1>1,000,002 people from a billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a much better way to think.</v>

65
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.793
<v Speaker 1>And we are seriously networked together </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're networked together more now </v>

66
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:49.900
<v Speaker 1>than we ever have beaten.</v>

67
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.733
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that that might</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean is that the choices you make are </v>

68
00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:59.740
<v Speaker 1>amplified and distributed not only far </v>
<v Speaker 1>faster than they ever have been,</v>

69
00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:02.110
<v Speaker 1>but with far more impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

70
00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:02.944
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that Carl Jung pointed</v>
<v Speaker 1>out was that when he had this idea that </v>

71
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.730
<v Speaker 1>when science split that that elk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.050
<v Speaker 1>is the root of science in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this dream like sub straight out of</v>

73
00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:15.390
<v Speaker 1>which science emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

74
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.563
<v Speaker 1>but alchemy was kind of a weird ad </v>
<v Speaker 1>mixture of religious thinking and </v>

75
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:20.044
<v Speaker 1>scientific thinking because those two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things hadn't been differentiated back </v>

76
00:04:23.261 --> 00:04:26.050
<v Speaker 1>when there were alchemists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Ewan believed that what had happened</v>

77
00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:26.771
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Europe,</v>

78
00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:27.604
<v Speaker 1>at least first was that the scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>and developing me blew up and expanded </v>

79
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:32.524
<v Speaker 1>at an exponential rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that led to this advanced </v>

80
00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:35.314
<v Speaker 1>technological civilization that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that the moral dimension that was </v>

81
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:41.020
<v Speaker 1>embedded in the religious symbolism </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't develop at all.</v>

82
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.853
<v Speaker 1>And so we're in this unstable situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we're far more technologically </v>

83
00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:46.744
<v Speaker 1>proficient than we are wise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that that's actually a big problem </v>

84
00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:53.020
<v Speaker 1>because obviously the more powerful the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tools you generate,</v>

85
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.350
<v Speaker 1>the more intelligent ethically you </v>
<v Speaker 1>better be or things are going to really,</v>

86
00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.253
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

87
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.480
<v Speaker 1>are going to go to hell in a handbasket </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

88
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:02.920
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

89
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.950
<v Speaker 1>and I had this thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I shared a little bit last night</v>

90
00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:06.761
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

91
00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:08.530
<v Speaker 1>in the next five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six years,</v>

92
00:05:08.531 --> 00:05:11.440
<v Speaker 1>we're going to develop pretty viciously </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent ai systems.</v>

93
00:05:11.441 --> 00:05:12.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's already happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

94
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.633
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're monitoring youtube and they're </v>

95
00:05:14.651 --> 00:05:15.484
<v Speaker 1>monitoring facebook and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>monitoring google and they're trying to </v>

96
00:05:17.021 --> 00:05:19.210
<v Speaker 1>make ethical decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these ai systems.</v>

97
00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:20.044
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the ethical presuppositions of </v>

98
00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:25.870
<v Speaker 1>the programmers are being embedded into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the infrastructure of the net.</v>

99
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.033
<v Speaker 1>And that's a hell of a thing to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it means that for better or </v>

100
00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:31.780
<v Speaker 1>worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're building automated intelligence is</v>

101
00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:33.370
<v Speaker 1>that reflect our own morality.</v>

102
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:34.743
<v Speaker 1>And we better be very careful about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>our morality is if we're going to </v>

103
00:05:36.671 --> 00:05:39.520
<v Speaker 1>automate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because automated systems are incredibly</v>

104
00:05:39.521 --> 00:05:40.540
<v Speaker 1>powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

105
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.220
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of,</v>

106
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.083
<v Speaker 1>that's where we're at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least to some degree in terms of the </v>

107
00:05:45.671 --> 00:05:50.440
<v Speaker 1>new technological transformations with </v>
<v Speaker 1>in communication technology.</v>

108
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:51.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it puts each of us at the,</v>

109
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.073
<v Speaker 1>at the center of a wide web of </v>
<v Speaker 1>connections and makes the consequences </v>

110
00:05:56.021 --> 00:05:59.330
<v Speaker 1>of our moral decisions much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately manifest to each of us.</v>

111
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.293
<v Speaker 1>And it kind of begs the question too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how should you behave on facebook </v>

112
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:03.914
<v Speaker 1>and how should you behave on twitter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think twitter drives me a little bit </v>

113
00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:08.240
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:09.243
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on at a fair bit and I'm not sure </v>

115
00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:14.900
<v Speaker 1>it's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I tend to distribute things that are</v>

116
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.393
<v Speaker 1>alarming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say in some sense maybe they are </v>

117
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:18.704
<v Speaker 1>alarming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological or ideologically they're </v>

118
00:06:20.601 --> 00:06:21.434
<v Speaker 1>disturbing.</v>

119
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.860
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking about that today in </v>
<v Speaker 1>preparation for this talk.</v>

120
00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:25.694
<v Speaker 1>And I wasn't really sure that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily a good idea because there </v>

121
00:06:29.301 --> 00:06:31.940
<v Speaker 1>are a lot of alarming things happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time,</v>

122
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.580
<v Speaker 1>everywhere obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

123
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.390
<v Speaker 1>and now we can share all of them always </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

124
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.710
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing about one alarming thing a day,</v>

125
00:06:42.711 --> 00:06:45.350
<v Speaker 1>you're hearing about like 500 alarming </v>
<v Speaker 1>things a day.</v>

126
00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:47.060
<v Speaker 1>And so then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

127
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.040
<v Speaker 1>what are you supposed to do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

128
00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:52.010
<v Speaker 1>does that indicate the state that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a state of emergency?</v>

129
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.143
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know cause you don't know how </v>

130
00:06:53.811 --> 00:06:56.180
<v Speaker 1>to calibrate the information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was thinking,</v>

131
00:06:56.181 --> 00:06:57.014
<v Speaker 1>well maybe the right way to behave on </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter is only two forward good things </v>

132
00:07:00.141 --> 00:07:01.160
<v Speaker 1>that are happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

133
00:07:01.161 --> 00:07:03.080
<v Speaker 1>cause there's lots of good things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are happening.</v>

134
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.000
<v Speaker 1>But I actually don't know the answer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

135
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.830
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea and I don't think anybody</v>

136
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:07.664
<v Speaker 1>else does either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do know that there are studies with </v>

137
00:07:09.801 --> 00:07:13.160
<v Speaker 1>regards to facebook that show that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>more time that you spend on facebook,</v>

138
00:07:13.161 --> 00:07:13.994
<v Speaker 1>the more depressed you are and that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like it's a causal relationship </v>

139
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:18.920
<v Speaker 1>rather than just a correlational </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

140
00:07:18.921 --> 00:07:19.754
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to have something to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the fact that facebook is one of </v>

141
00:07:22.851 --> 00:07:26.150
<v Speaker 1>those platforms where everybody puts up </v>
<v Speaker 1>an advertisement for their life,</v>

142
00:07:26.151 --> 00:07:26.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

143
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:27.733
<v Speaker 1>here I am with my new girlfriend in The </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bahamas being happy and here I am in a </v>

144
00:07:31.191 --> 00:07:32.660
<v Speaker 1>mountain being happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

145
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.840
<v Speaker 1>it's not you like miserable with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cover over your head,</v>

146
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.670
<v Speaker 1>unable to get out of bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

147
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.040
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't broadcast that.</v>

148
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.210
<v Speaker 1>You can think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

149
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:45.200
<v Speaker 1>I means you're presenting people with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>falsely positive view of your life.</v>

150
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.830
<v Speaker 1>And then they compare their lives to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they come up short and you think,</v>

151
00:07:48.831 --> 00:07:52.250
<v Speaker 1>well that's a kind of deception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by the same token,</v>

152
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:53.084
<v Speaker 1>you don't stop random strangers on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>street and tell them how miserable your </v>

153
00:07:55.281 --> 00:07:56.120
<v Speaker 1>life is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

154
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:57.530
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to hear about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

155
00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.650
<v Speaker 1>they want to see a facade of normality </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

156
00:08:00.651 --> 00:08:01.490
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

157
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just casual day to day interactions.</v>

158
00:08:04.131 --> 00:08:08.810
<v Speaker 1>And so part of prosocial behavior is </v>
<v Speaker 1>only to put what's at least,</v>

159
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>normative and good forward.</v>

160
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:13.760
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

161
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.770
<v Speaker 1>so I don't think that's necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>deception,</v>

162
00:08:15.771 --> 00:08:16.604
<v Speaker 1>but the mass consequence of that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that we don't understand at </v>

163
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:20.330
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

164
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.030
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so with that sort of introduction,</v>

165
00:08:23.031 --> 00:08:23.864
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to kind of walk you through my</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience with social media and let's </v>

166
00:08:27.921 --> 00:08:30.380
<v Speaker 1>say the old media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for lack of a better word,</v>

167
00:08:30.381 --> 00:08:33.200
<v Speaker 1>and I'll try to give you a balanced </v>
<v Speaker 1>account and to tell you,</v>

168
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:34.843
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's to see if I can draw some </v>

169
00:08:35.541 --> 00:08:39.170
<v Speaker 1>conclusions about what's happened to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>

170
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:40.003
<v Speaker 1>For the last year has been so busy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had proper time to reflect on </v>

171
00:08:44.241 --> 00:08:45.860
<v Speaker 1>what's been happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if I did,</v>

172
00:08:45.861 --> 00:08:46.694
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exactly sure I would be able to </v>

173
00:08:47.751 --> 00:08:50.990
<v Speaker 1>understand it anyways because it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

174
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:51.913
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I have a framework of </v>

175
00:08:52.911 --> 00:08:53.744
<v Speaker 1>reference within which to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I started working for this company </v>

176
00:08:57.991 --> 00:09:01.800
<v Speaker 1>called Television TV Ontario About 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>16 years ago.</v>

177
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.860
<v Speaker 1>I had talked to a producer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his name was Waldeck Shimberg.</v>

178
00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:08.430
<v Speaker 1>He's a emigrate Polish Jew in a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>smart guy.</v>

179
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.833
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he phoned me up at the university and </v>

180
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:13.103
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that distinguishes me </v>
<v Speaker 1>to some degree from my colleagues is </v>

181
00:09:15.601 --> 00:09:16.434
<v Speaker 1>that I'll talk to the press and that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually not afraid of them or </v>

182
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.380
<v Speaker 1>distrustful of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of my colleagues,</v>

183
00:09:22.381 --> 00:09:25.680
<v Speaker 1>not all of them are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're critical of the press,</v>

184
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.560
<v Speaker 1>partly in an arrogant way and partly in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a defensive way.</v>

185
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:28.951
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

186
00:09:28.951 --> 00:09:30.900
<v Speaker 1>they always get it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

187
00:09:30.901 --> 00:09:31.471
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

188
00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:34.290
<v Speaker 1>there isn't a day and they don't always </v>
<v Speaker 1>get it wrong.</v>

189
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.170
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

190
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.013
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll also shy away from the press as </v>

191
00:09:38.341 --> 00:09:41.610
<v Speaker 1>if they're being intruded upon when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth is generally speaking.</v>

192
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.983
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that they're putting forward</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't of sufficient interest to draw </v>

193
00:09:45.571 --> 00:09:47.310
<v Speaker 1>public attention anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

194
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:52.300
<v Speaker 1>but I talked to what EC for a long time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he invited me to go on a couple of,</v>

195
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.690
<v Speaker 1>of shows and then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

196
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:56.003
<v Speaker 1>then I ended up on TV shows the agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a pretty good public affairs </v>

197
00:09:59.041 --> 00:10:00.870
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the few,</v>

198
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.950
<v Speaker 1>I would say deep new shows left that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

199
00:10:03.951 --> 00:10:07.110
<v Speaker 1>that are on normal broadcast tv and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

200
00:10:07.111 --> 00:10:07.944
<v Speaker 1>they go into issues in some depth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they fragmented that up a bit </v>

201
00:10:10.381 --> 00:10:11.214
<v Speaker 1>in recent years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I became a fairly common guest on </v>

202
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.360
<v Speaker 1>those shows and people seem to like what</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was saying,</v>

203
00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:19.530
<v Speaker 1>which always surprised me.</v>

204
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

205
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.073
<v Speaker 1>but it was good because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it must be pretty damn horrible to put </v>

206
00:10:24.421 --> 00:10:29.421
<v Speaker 1>yourself out in the public eye and face </v>
<v Speaker 1>primary criticism for what you're doing.</v>

207
00:10:29.431 --> 00:10:32.400
<v Speaker 1>I think that would be unbearable in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense unless you were very,</v>

208
00:10:32.401 --> 00:10:35.310
<v Speaker 1>very strongly constituted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

209
00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:36.933
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that went on for a while and we'll deck </v>

210
00:10:38.161 --> 00:10:41.760
<v Speaker 1>was running this a series called big </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>

211
00:10:41.761 --> 00:10:43.620
<v Speaker 1>which was actually quite prescient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

212
00:10:43.621 --> 00:10:48.621
<v Speaker 1>so he had lecturers come to Toronto and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he had all pretty much all the major</v>

213
00:10:49.411 --> 00:10:50.244
<v Speaker 1>public intellectuals in the world over a</v>
<v Speaker 1>period of about five years or six years </v>

214
00:10:53.041 --> 00:10:53.874
<v Speaker 1>or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come and deliver bare bones lectures of </v>

215
00:10:56.971 --> 00:11:00.180
<v Speaker 1>this sort fundamentally need taped them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and put them on tv,</v>

216
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:01.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

217
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.510
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was sort of unheard of.</v>

218
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:04.373
<v Speaker 1>The production quality was well high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not overproduced weren't multiple </v>

219
00:11:08.191 --> 00:11:09.024
<v Speaker 1>cameras and edits and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and intelligent commentary from people </v>

220
00:11:12.091 --> 00:11:12.840
<v Speaker 1>in the background.</v>

221
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.630
<v Speaker 1>It was purely content driven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

222
00:11:15.631 --> 00:11:16.464
<v Speaker 1>and it actually got pretty popular on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on itunes and you can still find the </v>

223
00:11:20.581 --> 00:11:23.490
<v Speaker 1>lectures there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Tvo couldn't they,</v>

224
00:11:23.491 --> 00:11:24.301
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

225
00:11:24.301 --> 00:11:25.134
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pulled the show even though their </v>

226
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:27.923
<v Speaker 1>primary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mandate from the government was to </v>

227
00:11:30.061 --> 00:11:32.730
<v Speaker 1>educate the public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was a very low budget show with</v>

228
00:11:32.731 --> 00:11:33.564
<v Speaker 1>very high quality minds that people were</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually watching and downloading a lot </v>

229
00:11:37.621 --> 00:11:38.454
<v Speaker 1>on itunes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't seem to take the </v>

230
00:11:40.741 --> 00:11:44.190
<v Speaker 1>nonstandard media with any degree of </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriousness.</v>

231
00:11:44.191 --> 00:11:47.070
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of a common human attribute,</v>

232
00:11:47.071 --> 00:11:48.600
<v Speaker 1>which is that if you don't know about </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

233
00:11:48.601 --> 00:11:50.310
<v Speaker 1>you don't take it seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

234
00:11:50.311 --> 00:11:51.870
<v Speaker 1>And it's because if you don't know about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

235
00:11:51.871 --> 00:11:54.760
<v Speaker 1>well it's just gray and fuzzy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right to you.</v>

236
00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.420
<v Speaker 1>You have no differentiated knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's easy to oversimplify it.</v>

237
00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:01.960
<v Speaker 1>And I think part of the problem with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>classical media,</v>

238
00:12:01.961 --> 00:12:02.794
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to make a transition to the </v>

239
00:12:04.331 --> 00:12:07.750
<v Speaker 1>digital age is that they have no idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the digital media is.</v>

240
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching an MSNBC,</v>

241
00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.860
<v Speaker 1>a clip the other day about this robot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think her name is Sophia,</v>

242
00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:15.870
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

243
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:16.703
<v Speaker 1>who has a fairly advanced degree of </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence and who can </v>

244
00:12:19.811 --> 00:12:22.780
<v Speaker 1>manifest pretty realistic human facial </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>

245
00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:26.470
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a four minute clip and had a 32nd</v>

246
00:12:26.471 --> 00:12:28.960
<v Speaker 1>ad at the beginning of it and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't skip the ad.</v>

247
00:12:28.961 --> 00:12:32.470
<v Speaker 1>And I thought there's a real arrogance </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the part of the MBA,</v>

248
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:33.363
<v Speaker 1>ms NBC people to put that on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because anybody who's familiar with the </v>

249
00:12:36.911 --> 00:12:38.260
<v Speaker 1>youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

250
00:12:38.261 --> 00:12:39.094
<v Speaker 1>culture knows that what you get to put a</v>
<v Speaker 1>ten second ad on and then you get to </v>

251
00:12:42.671 --> 00:12:43.504
<v Speaker 1>skip it after five seconds if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't ask people to pay 30 </v>

252
00:12:47.711 --> 00:12:50.050
<v Speaker 1>seconds of attention for four minutes of</v>
<v Speaker 1>content.</v>

253
00:12:50.051 --> 00:12:51.900
<v Speaker 1>It violates the norms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it,</v>

254
00:12:51.901 --> 00:12:52.734
<v Speaker 1>it only had about 12,000 views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really interesting example </v>

255
00:12:55.661 --> 00:12:59.530
<v Speaker 1>of Marshall Mcluhan's idea that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>medium is the message,</v>

256
00:12:59.531 --> 00:12:59.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

257
00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.960
<v Speaker 1>As you build a new technological </v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure.</v>

258
00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:03.123
<v Speaker 1>And it's sort of like the old thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because youtube is sort of like a TV </v>

259
00:13:06.041 --> 00:13:06.874
<v Speaker 1>network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also not like a TV network at </v>

260
00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:10.480
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly for example,</v>

261
00:13:10.481 --> 00:13:12.040
<v Speaker 1>because when you put something on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube,</v>

262
00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:12.874
<v Speaker 1>it's permanent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's way different than broadcast </v>

263
00:13:15.191 --> 00:13:16.660
<v Speaker 1>TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's raw,</v>

264
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:19.690
<v Speaker 1>it's seriously revolutionarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

265
00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:24.820
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's also the case to that then this</v>

266
00:13:24.821 --> 00:13:28.090
<v Speaker 1>is a strange thing and I don't think the</v>
<v Speaker 1>classic media understands this either,</v>

267
00:13:28.091 --> 00:13:30.760
<v Speaker 1>is that youtube people don't like high </v>
<v Speaker 1>production values.</v>

268
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.620
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very cynical about them.</v>

269
00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:33.723
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's because they've come </v>
<v Speaker 1>to identify advanced editing and Glitz </v>

270
00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.130
<v Speaker 1>as markers that the information is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually being manipulated,</v>

271
00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.130
<v Speaker 1>which of course it is now for better or </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

272
00:13:45.131 --> 00:13:47.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean editing doesn't have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulating,</v>

273
00:13:47.531 --> 00:13:49.810
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

274
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:53.020
<v Speaker 1>and besides that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the more tech savvy people that</v>

275
00:13:53.021 --> 00:13:53.854
<v Speaker 1>watch youtube can duplicate those sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of special effects in their own home in </v>

276
00:13:56.561 --> 00:13:57.250
<v Speaker 1>half an hour.</v>

277
00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:01.270
<v Speaker 1>So they're not there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're no longer markers of the kind of</v>

278
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:05.980
<v Speaker 1>competence and technological prowess </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would signal the sort of competence</v>

279
00:14:05.981 --> 00:14:08.380
<v Speaker 1>that you could trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

280
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:09.303
<v Speaker 1>so what youtube viewers seem to like is </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically ordinary people more or less </v>

281
00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.473
<v Speaker 1>trying to have an intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation about something confusing </v>

282
00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:19.624
<v Speaker 1>and important and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the attention span that people are </v>

283
00:14:22.841 --> 00:14:23.674
<v Speaker 1>willing to devote to that is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite remarkable for for a medium that </v>

284
00:14:26.711 --> 00:14:29.590
<v Speaker 1>was nothing but cute cat videos say five</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

285
00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.633
<v Speaker 1>The fact that like a lot of my lectures </v>
<v Speaker 1>and like Joe Rogan's podcast like three </v>

286
00:14:33.701 --> 00:14:35.920
<v Speaker 1>hours long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like what the hell?</v>

287
00:14:35.921 --> 00:14:39.610
<v Speaker 1>People weren't supposed to have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity to pay attention in this era of</v>

288
00:14:39.611 --> 00:14:41.950
<v Speaker 1>fragmented attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

289
00:14:41.951 --> 00:14:44.440
<v Speaker 1>in Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know this or not.</v>

290
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.193
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has 120 million downloads a month </v>

291
00:14:48.491 --> 00:14:52.490
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's 1.5 billion downloads a year.</v>

292
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.880
<v Speaker 1>And so the last time I saw him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was with Brett who just spoke,</v>

293
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:57.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

294
00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.680
<v Speaker 1>I asked him what it was like to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most powerful interview or the world has</v>

295
00:15:00.681 --> 00:15:02.960
<v Speaker 1>ever seen because I think he probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

296
00:15:02.961 --> 00:15:06.830
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it and sheer numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe Walter cronkite back in the</v>

297
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:09.680
<v Speaker 1>60s had some comparable influence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he said,</v>

298
00:15:09.681 --> 00:15:10.850
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think about it.</v>

299
00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:12.320
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

300
00:15:12.321 --> 00:15:14.030
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is he supposed to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it?</v>

301
00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:16.550
<v Speaker 1>Because no one knows what to think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

302
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.510
<v Speaker 1>And so he just has the conversations and</v>
<v Speaker 1>posts some and away he goes,</v>

303
00:15:20.511 --> 00:15:21.344
<v Speaker 1>but he has no idea what role he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>currently playing in society and we </v>

304
00:15:24.561 --> 00:15:28.730
<v Speaker 1>don't have proper metrics for measuring </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and we don't understand it at all.</v>

305
00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.570
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did these big idea lectures with,</v>

306
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.750
<v Speaker 1>with air con and they were ranked on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on uh,</v>

307
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:37.693
<v Speaker 1>the Dvo channel and the five lectures or</v>
<v Speaker 1>six lectures I did all ended up in the </v>

308
00:15:41.661 --> 00:15:43.820
<v Speaker 1>top 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which really surprised me.</v>

309
00:15:43.821 --> 00:15:47.510
<v Speaker 1>But it was an indication that there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about what I was talking about</v>

310
00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:51.050
<v Speaker 1>that for which there was a market and </v>
<v Speaker 1>now there's,</v>

311
00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:52.550
<v Speaker 1>there's some reasons for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

312
00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:53.660
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

313
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.800
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a book from 1984 to 1999 called </v>
<v Speaker 1>maps of meaning.</v>

314
00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:02.420
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of the things I talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>come out of all the reading I did during</v>

315
00:16:02.421 --> 00:16:03.254
<v Speaker 1>that period because I was reading an </v>
<v Speaker 1>insane amount and thinking really </v>

316
00:16:06.111 --> 00:16:06.944
<v Speaker 1>nonstop 16 hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the only way I could stop myself </v>

317
00:16:09.681 --> 00:16:11.540
<v Speaker 1>from thinking was to go work out with </v>
<v Speaker 1>weights.</v>

318
00:16:11.541 --> 00:16:12.374
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't shut off my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my concern with the issues that I was </v>

319
00:16:15.561 --> 00:16:19.010
<v Speaker 1>dealing with and I was spending about </v>
<v Speaker 1>three hours a day writing and I did that</v>

320
00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:22.250
<v Speaker 1>everyday for 15 years and that was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

321
00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.320
<v Speaker 1>That was the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

322
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.863
<v Speaker 1>the writing also helped a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount because it helps clarify your </v>

323
00:16:29.901 --> 00:16:30.920
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>

324
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:31.873
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because actually you're smarter when </v>

325
00:16:33.291 --> 00:16:33.711
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

326
00:16:33.711 --> 00:16:37.730
<v Speaker 1>Because you can externalize your </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and then you can,</v>

327
00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:38.803
<v Speaker 1>you can use your working memory to </v>
<v Speaker 1>analyze what you've written instead of </v>

328
00:16:41.061 --> 00:16:43.280
<v Speaker 1>remembering the thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're,</v>

329
00:16:43.281 --> 00:16:44.630
<v Speaker 1>you're externalizing your memory.</v>

330
00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.970
<v Speaker 1>You can analyze what you thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can refine it,</v>

331
00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:48.103
<v Speaker 1>you can reorder it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can edit like mad with a word </v>

332
00:16:49.851 --> 00:16:52.940
<v Speaker 1>processor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also a very new thing to it.</v>

333
00:16:52.941 --> 00:16:53.774
<v Speaker 1>Editing is very difficult if you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that with pen and paper with a </v>

334
00:16:55.851 --> 00:16:56.601
<v Speaker 1>typewriter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

335
00:16:56.601 --> 00:16:59.150
<v Speaker 1>forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get your first draft and that's it.</v>

336
00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:00.733
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I was doing with maps of </v>

337
00:17:02.631 --> 00:17:04.880
<v Speaker 1>meaning was I was trying to solve a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

338
00:17:04.881 --> 00:17:05.714
<v Speaker 1>And the problem was it was the problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I was concerned that underlie </v>

339
00:17:09.681 --> 00:17:14.570
<v Speaker 1>the conflict between the Western world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the communist world essentially.</v>

340
00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:15.973
<v Speaker 1>And that problem was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the reason it was a problem was </v>

341
00:17:18.411 --> 00:17:21.260
<v Speaker 1>because we were so highly armed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even as we are now.</v>

342
00:17:21.261 --> 00:17:24.860
<v Speaker 1>And of course that problem is </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifesting itself once again with North</v>

343
00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:28.100
<v Speaker 1>Korea that might render everything we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about completely irrelevant,</v>

344
00:17:28.101 --> 00:17:28.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

345
00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:32.090
<v Speaker 1>We cause we don't know which catastrophe</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the one most worth worrying about,</v>

346
00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:33.373
<v Speaker 1>but I was interested in the conflict </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the communist way of looking at </v>

347
00:17:38.331 --> 00:17:40.250
<v Speaker 1>the world and the Western way of looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the world.</v>

348
00:17:40.251 --> 00:17:41.084
<v Speaker 1>And I think I actually had a postmodern </v>
<v Speaker 1>concern with that because one of the </v>

349
00:17:44.241 --> 00:17:45.074
<v Speaker 1>things I was curious about was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the world is susceptible to a </v>

350
00:17:49.231 --> 00:17:50.064
<v Speaker 1>multitude of interpretations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions and the Communist </v>

351
00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:53.604
<v Speaker 1>interpretation is one form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation and the western </v>

352
00:17:57.181 --> 00:17:58.014
<v Speaker 1>capitalist democratic form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation is another form of </v>

353
00:18:01.051 --> 00:18:01.884
<v Speaker 1>interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And is there any grounds on which you </v>

354
00:18:05.071 --> 00:18:05.904
<v Speaker 1>can determine that one of those is </v>
<v Speaker 1>superior to the other or more correct </v>

355
00:18:09.481 --> 00:18:10.314
<v Speaker 1>than the other?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is it a matter purely of opinion and </v>

356
00:18:12.841 --> 00:18:13.674
<v Speaker 1>social organization or maybe even </v>
<v Speaker 1>warfare to determine who's going to be </v>

357
00:18:16.711 --> 00:18:17.544
<v Speaker 1>the victor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's no other way of </v>

358
00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:21.720
<v Speaker 1>determining who's going to be the victor</v>
<v Speaker 1>then actual conflict.</v>

359
00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:23.093
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I started to look underneath </v>

360
00:18:25.921 --> 00:18:29.700
<v Speaker 1>belief structures and I didn't know you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could do that really to begin with.</v>

361
00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.400
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my first degree was in political science</v>

362
00:18:32.401 --> 00:18:33.234
<v Speaker 1>and I kind of wandered out of that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the professors kept insisting to me in </v>

363
00:18:36.811 --> 00:18:40.710
<v Speaker 1>the upper years of my studies that all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the conflict between human beings was</v>

364
00:18:40.711 --> 00:18:41.544
<v Speaker 1>driven by economic disparity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just never bought that because </v>

365
00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.270
<v Speaker 1>that's like saying that people fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what they value.</v>

366
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.400
<v Speaker 1>And for me that just begged the question</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

367
00:18:50.401 --> 00:18:51.630
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fair enough.</v>

368
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.670
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

369
00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.513
<v Speaker 1>it's almost self evident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the real question is why do they </v>

370
00:18:55.891 --> 00:18:59.790
<v Speaker 1>value what they value?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because human beings are quite a diverse</v>

371
00:18:59.791 --> 00:19:00.624
<v Speaker 1>lot and it's not self evident why we </v>
<v Speaker 1>value some things rather than other </v>

372
00:19:03.691 --> 00:19:05.250
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're starving to death,</v>

373
00:19:05.251 --> 00:19:07.200
<v Speaker 1>it's obvious that you're going to value </v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

374
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.820
<v Speaker 1>But that's a limit case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

375
00:19:08.821 --> 00:19:10.500
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that interesting.</v>

376
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:11.361
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

377
00:19:11.361 --> 00:19:12.194
<v Speaker 1>it's too simplified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't find that a compelling </v>

378
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:22.050
<v Speaker 1>explanation and I still don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the economic explanation for,</v>

379
00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:26.160
<v Speaker 1>for human conflict is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is shallow and tautological even.</v>

380
00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:29.590
<v Speaker 1>And then I started to read some people </v>
<v Speaker 1>whose,</v>

381
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:30.463
<v Speaker 1>whose writings really gripped me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's an interesting </v>

382
00:19:32.941 --> 00:19:33.930
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

383
00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:37.350
<v Speaker 1>and I was studying psychology by this </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

384
00:19:37.351 --> 00:19:40.510
<v Speaker 1>I switched into psychology and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

385
00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.560
<v Speaker 1>I was starting to read the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysts and I really got,</v>

386
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:45.690
<v Speaker 1>I really got interested in what they had</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>

387
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:47.103
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly from reading Freud because I was </v>

388
00:19:49.441 --> 00:19:52.590
<v Speaker 1>really interested in his analysis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>family dynamics and have dreams,</v>

389
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.750
<v Speaker 1>but more particularly from reading </v>
<v Speaker 1>young.</v>

390
00:19:54.751 --> 00:19:56.760
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I learned from </v>
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>

391
00:19:56.761 --> 00:20:00.390
<v Speaker 1>which really has never ceased to shock </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

392
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:02.100
<v Speaker 1>was his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

393
00:20:02.101 --> 00:20:03.390
<v Speaker 1>he basically made a point.</v>

394
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:07.080
<v Speaker 1>And the point was that you're not master</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your own house.</v>

395
00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.093
<v Speaker 1>That there are forces that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are operating on you at an unconscious </v>

396
00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:15.780
<v Speaker 1>level that determine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

397
00:20:15.781 --> 00:20:18.810
<v Speaker 1>the direction of your attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

398
00:20:18.811 --> 00:20:19.644
<v Speaker 1>you know how sometimes you'll read </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to really grip you and then </v>

399
00:20:22.111 --> 00:20:24.840
<v Speaker 1>you'll read something else and you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't even concentrate on it.</v>

400
00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.100
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

401
00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:29.220
<v Speaker 1>I need to concentrate on this boring </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

402
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:30.263
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause an exam depends on it or a </v>

403
00:20:31.291 --> 00:20:32.124
<v Speaker 1>promotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's just no damn way you're </v>

404
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.890
<v Speaker 1>reading it and your attention flips all </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the place and,</v>

405
00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:37.950
<v Speaker 1>and you know you're undisciplined and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>

406
00:20:37.951 --> 00:20:38.784
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you have this other thing and </v>

407
00:20:39.961 --> 00:20:41.610
<v Speaker 1>it just grips you like this and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

408
00:20:41.611 --> 00:20:42.444
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what,</v>

409
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:46.020
<v Speaker 1>what's doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not your will.</v>

410
00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.273
<v Speaker 1>Because your would be the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would allow you to concentrate on </v>

411
00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:51.520
<v Speaker 1>whatever you chose to concentrate on.</v>

412
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:52.713
<v Speaker 1>It's something underneath your will </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually directing your </v>

413
00:20:54.941 --> 00:20:56.650
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could say,</v>

414
00:20:56.651 --> 00:20:58.810
<v Speaker 1>well it's random,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course it's not.</v>

415
00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:02.110
<v Speaker 1>It's maybe random if you have a serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>case of schizophrenia.</v>

416
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.273
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think in some sense that's </v>

417
00:21:04.421 --> 00:21:06.340
<v Speaker 1>actually the definition of </v>
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia.</v>

418
00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:09.250
<v Speaker 1>But it's not random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a functioning human being,</v>

419
00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.353
<v Speaker 1>the thing that grips your attention and </v>
<v Speaker 1>directs it to one place or another is </v>

420
00:21:13.601 --> 00:21:14.434
<v Speaker 1>something that's what's a deep instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a manifestation of what union </v>

421
00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:19.930
<v Speaker 1>called the self,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very interesting idea.</v>

422
00:21:19.931 --> 00:21:22.600
<v Speaker 1>So human thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is such a cool idea.</v>

423
00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:23.913
<v Speaker 1>He thought that the mechanism that </v>
<v Speaker 1>directed your attention in the present </v>

424
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:31.480
<v Speaker 1>was your future self attempting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest itself in the present world.</v>

425
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:32.583
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you have a potential and that </v>

426
00:21:35.441 --> 00:21:36.274
<v Speaker 1>potential is what you could be in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in order for that potential to </v>

427
00:21:39.581 --> 00:21:42.670
<v Speaker 1>manifest itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be palpable in the present.</v>

428
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:43.833
<v Speaker 1>And the way that instinct for further </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop manifests itself in the present </v>

429
00:21:47.051 --> 00:21:47.884
<v Speaker 1>is by directing your attention towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are likely to increase your </v>

430
00:21:50.681 --> 00:21:53.020
<v Speaker 1>competence and further your growth right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

431
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:56.140
<v Speaker 1>And that's just an unbelievable idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

432
00:21:56.141 --> 00:21:56.974
<v Speaker 1>it's like your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your potential better self beckoning to </v>

433
00:21:59.741 --> 00:22:01.990
<v Speaker 1>you in the present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

434
00:22:01.991 --> 00:22:04.810
<v Speaker 1>And I really can't think of a better </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation for it than that.</v>

435
00:22:04.811 --> 00:22:05.644
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good explanation but a </v>

436
00:22:07.451 --> 00:22:11.140
<v Speaker 1>very frightening one because it means in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense that you're,</v>

437
00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:12.603
<v Speaker 1>that something as fundamental as your </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention is more or less controlled by </v>

438
00:22:15.851 --> 00:22:16.684
<v Speaker 1>processes that are so deep that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have a tremendous amount of </v>

439
00:22:19.091 --> 00:22:22.390
<v Speaker 1>voluntary control over them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can interact with the forces to</v>

440
00:22:22.391 --> 00:22:23.530
<v Speaker 1>some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

441
00:22:23.531 --> 00:22:27.370
<v Speaker 1>you're not one of those per creatures </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can just tell yourself what to do.</v>

442
00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.130
<v Speaker 1>Life would be really easy if that's what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like right here.</v>

443
00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:32.800
<v Speaker 1>It's time to go to the gym three days a </v>
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>

444
00:22:32.801 --> 00:22:33.970
<v Speaker 1>two hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

445
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're superman in two years and you can</v>

446
00:22:36.131 --> 00:22:37.790
<v Speaker 1>eat properly and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

447
00:22:37.791 --> 00:22:40.630
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to drink too much and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to take cocaine and all</v>

448
00:22:40.631 --> 00:22:42.790
<v Speaker 1>of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just tell yourself that and bang,</v>

449
00:22:42.791 --> 00:22:43.624
<v Speaker 1>you quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's kind of weird that it isn't </v>

450
00:22:45.161 --> 00:22:48.520
<v Speaker 1>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really seriously not that way.</v>

451
00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:50.373
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was looking at the difference </v>

452
00:22:52.271 --> 00:22:55.570
<v Speaker 1>between the Communist system in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>western capitalist system,</v>

453
00:22:55.571 --> 00:22:56.404
<v Speaker 1>I started to get underneath the belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems to find out what was there at </v>

454
00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Ewan was extremely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how helpful and other thinkers that,</v>

455
00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:05.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've heard me mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've listened to my lectures,</v>

456
00:23:05.311 --> 00:23:06.144
<v Speaker 1>need Shin and dusty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Husky and social knits and seem to be </v>

457
00:23:08.411 --> 00:23:12.700
<v Speaker 1>the people who had dug deepest down into</v>
<v Speaker 1>those subterranean levels.</v>

458
00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:13.533
<v Speaker 1>And what I found,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think was that the communist system </v>

459
00:23:16.151 --> 00:23:18.070
<v Speaker 1>was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was very shallow.</v>

460
00:23:18.071 --> 00:23:18.904
<v Speaker 1>It was predicated on a set of rational </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumptions that were generated by a </v>

461
00:23:22.031 --> 00:23:26.380
<v Speaker 1>handful of people with no real </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological here or historical rooting.</v>

462
00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:27.693
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that the fact that that was </v>

463
00:23:30.071 --> 00:23:35.071
<v Speaker 1>the case was part of the reason why when</v>
<v Speaker 1>those ideas unfolded in real time,</v>

464
00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:38.680
<v Speaker 1>they were so murderous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just weren't imagine that,</v>

465
00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Karl Marx was thinking,</v>

466
00:23:41.021 --> 00:23:42.640
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the game that we're playing in.</v>

467
00:23:42.641 --> 00:23:43.474
<v Speaker 1>Here are the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that he laid out the rules </v>

468
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:49.190
<v Speaker 1>explicitly and then people made </v>
<v Speaker 1>societies that follow those rules.</v>

469
00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.800
<v Speaker 1>And it turned out that that game didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>work at all.</v>

470
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:54.500
<v Speaker 1>He just got it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like seriously Ra.</v>

471
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:58.160
<v Speaker 1>Whereas in the west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideas emerged from a,</v>

472
00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:02.930
<v Speaker 1>an unbroken historical process that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stretches back probably to the beginning</v>

473
00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:05.450
<v Speaker 1>of civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say maybe,</v>

474
00:24:05.451 --> 00:24:07.660
<v Speaker 1>maybe all the way back to Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows how,</v>

475
00:24:07.661 --> 00:24:09.620
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how ancient these ideas are.</v>

476
00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:10.453
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an unbroken con continuity of </v>

477
00:24:12.381 --> 00:24:13.214
<v Speaker 1>ideas that emerged up and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're expressed in symbolic form </v>

478
00:24:16.461 --> 00:24:17.294
<v Speaker 1>and it's on that symbolic platform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which actually matches our biology and </v>

479
00:24:20.781 --> 00:24:24.230
<v Speaker 1>our behavior that are more articulated </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas rest upon.</v>

480
00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.970
<v Speaker 1>And so I found that extremely useful and</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprising.</v>

481
00:24:28.971 --> 00:24:31.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't what I expected.</v>

482
00:24:31.301 --> 00:24:36.301
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at the same time I was,</v>

483
00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:39.590
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had another problem that emerged while</v>

484
00:24:39.591 --> 00:24:44.450
<v Speaker 1>I was dealing with this and one was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come to understand what group identity</v>

485
00:24:44.451 --> 00:24:45.284
<v Speaker 1>meant to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to have a group identity </v>

486
00:24:46.701 --> 00:24:48.740
<v Speaker 1>because you live with other people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>LE,</v>

487
00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:52.190
<v Speaker 1>unless you have a shared identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan talked about this a bit.</v>

488
00:24:52.191 --> 00:24:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Unless you have a central pole around </v>
<v Speaker 1>which you're all oriented,</v>

489
00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:00.620
<v Speaker 1>it's all chaotic and confused and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>in constant conflict and warfare.</v>

490
00:25:00.621 --> 00:25:02.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's a bad thing you do.</v>

491
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:05.690
<v Speaker 1>You do not want that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're all confused individually and</v>

492
00:25:05.691 --> 00:25:07.790
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a state of chaos.</v>

493
00:25:07.791 --> 00:25:12.020
<v Speaker 1>It's unbearable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you tighten up the group identity</v>

494
00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.990
<v Speaker 1>too great a degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say like the Nazis tried to do,</v>

495
00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:19.880
<v Speaker 1>then the probability that you'll come to</v>
<v Speaker 1>blows with other groups reaches a almost</v>

496
00:25:19.881 --> 00:25:21.740
<v Speaker 1>a point of certainty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

497
00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:22.933
<v Speaker 1>And so it seemed to me that human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>were damned if they did and damned if </v>

498
00:25:25.341 --> 00:25:26.630
<v Speaker 1>they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the,</v>

499
00:25:26.631 --> 00:25:29.060
<v Speaker 1>on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you dropped your group identity,</v>

500
00:25:29.061 --> 00:25:31.670
<v Speaker 1>then you fragmented and degenerated into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chaos.</v>

501
00:25:31.671 --> 00:25:34.610
<v Speaker 1>And if you gripped hard to your group </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity,</v>

502
00:25:34.611 --> 00:25:35.444
<v Speaker 1>then you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tilted towards totalitarianism and </v>

503
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.770
<v Speaker 1>group conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought,</v>

504
00:25:39.771 --> 00:25:40.604
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was okay in the past to tilt </v>

505
00:25:41.931 --> 00:25:44.180
<v Speaker 1>towards group conflict because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

506
00:25:44.181 --> 00:25:46.360
<v Speaker 1>when we had sticks and swords,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

507
00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.710
<v Speaker 1>we'd have a war in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lots of people would get killed in,</v>

508
00:25:48.711 --> 00:25:49.544
<v Speaker 1>lots of people would get hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the entire planet wouldn't burst </v>

509
00:25:51.801 --> 00:25:52.610
<v Speaker 1>into flames.</v>

510
00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:53.443
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

511
00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:54.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

512
00:25:54.381 --> 00:25:55.940
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this inborn</v>

513
00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:58.333
<v Speaker 1>dichotomy of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of catastrophe that characterized human </v>

514
00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:05.060
<v Speaker 1>existence wasn't something that could </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiral into complete destruction.</v>

515
00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:08.840
<v Speaker 1>And so we could get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now in a thermonuclear age,</v>

516
00:26:08.841 --> 00:26:11.960
<v Speaker 1>it's like we can't get away with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's still what we're like.</v>

517
00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:15.560
<v Speaker 1>We're still like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for months I thought,</v>

518
00:26:15.561 --> 00:26:16.260
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

519
00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:18.800
<v Speaker 1>I always believed that if you could get </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the bottom of a problem,</v>

520
00:26:18.801 --> 00:26:20.170
<v Speaker 1>you could solve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause that,</v>

521
00:26:20.171 --> 00:26:22.850
<v Speaker 1>that was sort of the definition of </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting to the bottom of it.</v>

522
00:26:22.851 --> 00:26:23.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

523
00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:23.751
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

524
00:26:23.751 --> 00:26:26.750
<v Speaker 1>solution would emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I got to the bottom of it,</v>

525
00:26:26.751 --> 00:26:28.070
<v Speaker 1>as far as I could go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

526
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:29.780
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's group identity.</v>

527
00:26:29.781 --> 00:26:30.614
<v Speaker 1>And like group fostered warfare and </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe on the one hand and </v>

528
00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:37.970
<v Speaker 1>degenerate nihilism on the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like well jigs up.</v>

529
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:38.833
<v Speaker 1>There's no way out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had a prophetic dream at that </v>

530
00:26:42.201 --> 00:26:42.651
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

531
00:26:42.651 --> 00:26:44.280
<v Speaker 1>and I won't tell you the details of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

532
00:26:44.281 --> 00:26:45.114
<v Speaker 1>but it outlined a third pass to me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I had already picked up to some </v>

533
00:26:50.161 --> 00:26:50.994
<v Speaker 1>degree from reading young and also Eric </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] who is one of young great </v>

534
00:26:54.121 --> 00:26:56.160
<v Speaker 1>students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was,</v>

535
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.233
<v Speaker 1>that had to do with the embodiment of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the hero and the individual </v>

536
00:27:00.241 --> 00:27:01.074
<v Speaker 1>as the like the pathway of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>courageous individual as the mediating </v>

537
00:27:04.621 --> 00:27:08.940
<v Speaker 1>force between the chaos of nihilism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarianism,</v>

538
00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.360
<v Speaker 1>totalitarianism of authority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>authority,</v>

539
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.700
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian certainty that there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>third path.</v>

540
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:15.863
<v Speaker 1>And then I started to understand its </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to religious thinking </v>

541
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.540
<v Speaker 1>mostly to Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but partly because that's my tradition,</v>

542
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:24.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in so far as I'm a western person say,</v>

543
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:25.793
<v Speaker 1>and I understood as well that it had </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to do and that this was what </v>

544
00:27:29.161 --> 00:27:31.420
<v Speaker 1>it was dramatized in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

545
00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:32.323
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

546
00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:33.323
<v Speaker 1>in the passion story in the New </v>
<v Speaker 1>Testament was that it had something to </v>

547
00:27:35.851 --> 00:27:36.684
<v Speaker 1>do with taking responsibility for </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence because Christ is </v>

548
00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:44.250
<v Speaker 1>architecturally the person who takes the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world's sins upon himself.</v>

549
00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:47.910
<v Speaker 1>And what that means in some sense is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you read about history,</v>

550
00:27:47.911 --> 00:27:50.760
<v Speaker 1>read about Nazi Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you read about the Soviet Gulags,</v>

551
00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:55.710
<v Speaker 1>you don't read as an observer looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>what other people have done.</v>

552
00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.670
<v Speaker 1>You read as the subject and the object </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the history.</v>

553
00:27:59.671 --> 00:28:00.504
<v Speaker 1>You're both the person who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>persecuted and the victimizer at the </v>

554
00:28:03.121 --> 00:28:04.460
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

555
00:28:04.461 --> 00:28:05.294
<v Speaker 1>you have to see both of those inside us </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual forces in order to understand </v>

556
00:28:08.791 --> 00:28:10.170
<v Speaker 1>history properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

557
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.110
<v Speaker 1>that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very terrifying thing to do.</v>

558
00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:15.870
<v Speaker 1>It's easier to take the part of victim </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>

559
00:28:15.871 --> 00:28:17.490
<v Speaker 1>even though that's terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

560
00:28:17.491 --> 00:28:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Because who wants to be the victim of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration camp,</v>

561
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:23.370
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe that's preferable ethically to</v>

562
00:28:23.371 --> 00:28:26.460
<v Speaker 1>being the perpetrator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you're reading about Auschwitz,</v>

563
00:28:26.461 --> 00:28:27.294
<v Speaker 1>you're not reading about past history of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading about exactly what people are </v>

564
00:28:30.421 --> 00:28:32.940
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very terrifying thing.</v>

565
00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:33.773
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things you have to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to take responsibility </v>

566
00:28:37.441 --> 00:28:41.520
<v Speaker 1>for the nature of your being is to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for the malevolence.</v>

567
00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:44.250
<v Speaker 1>That's truly part of human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

568
00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:47.640
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the encounter with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shadow from the union perspective.</v>

569
00:28:47.641 --> 00:28:48.474
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of ewing's proposition was that the </v>

570
00:28:50.041 --> 00:28:52.350
<v Speaker 1>human shadow reaches all the way down to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell.</v>

571
00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:53.573
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're used to thinking of religious </v>

572
00:28:56.821 --> 00:28:59.850
<v Speaker 1>language maybe even as outdated </v>
<v Speaker 1>superstition.</v>

573
00:28:59.851 --> 00:29:00.684
<v Speaker 1>But if you take that sort of statement </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously from a psychological </v>

574
00:29:03.421 --> 00:29:04.254
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it means in some sense is that the </v>

575
00:29:06.001 --> 00:29:09.540
<v Speaker 1>malevolence that resides inside you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in potential,</v>

576
00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:10.643
<v Speaker 1>is of the same sort as the malevolence </v>
<v Speaker 1>that produces the worst things that </v>

577
00:29:13.771 --> 00:29:16.740
<v Speaker 1>human beings have ever done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

578
00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:19.500
<v Speaker 1>and I couldn't see any way out of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>

579
00:29:19.501 --> 00:29:20.334
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more I read about the gulag system </v>

580
00:29:22.831 --> 00:29:26.670
<v Speaker 1>in the USSR and what happened in China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened in Nazi Germany,</v>

581
00:29:26.671 --> 00:29:27.504
<v Speaker 1>the more it became evident to me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>these weren't topped down systems </v>

582
00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:33.900
<v Speaker 1>imposed by tyrants on an unwilling </v>
<v Speaker 1>innocent population,</v>

583
00:29:33.901 --> 00:29:37.350
<v Speaker 1>but decisions on the part of entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures to go down a certain road.</v>

584
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:38.423
<v Speaker 1>Often the leaders were following,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I would say it was particularly </v>

585
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:42.183
<v Speaker 1>the case with Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which isn't to deny him his criminal </v>

586
00:29:45.011 --> 00:29:45.844
<v Speaker 1>culpability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Hitler was unbelievably good at </v>

587
00:29:48.461 --> 00:29:51.640
<v Speaker 1>letting the crowd tell him what to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

588
00:29:51.641 --> 00:29:54.880
<v Speaker 1>he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a mirror for the crowd and he was</v>

589
00:29:54.881 --> 00:29:57.160
<v Speaker 1>a good orator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he paid attention to the crowd.</v>

590
00:29:57.161 --> 00:30:00.310
<v Speaker 1>And so when he said something that made </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone cheer,</v>

591
00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.193
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're dark hearts would come out in </v>

592
00:30:02.501 --> 00:30:05.740
<v Speaker 1>the mob and cheer about something he </v>
<v Speaker 1>said that was say dramatic or,</v>

593
00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:06.843
<v Speaker 1>or vengeful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then he'd say more of that and the </v>

594
00:30:09.401 --> 00:30:12.820
<v Speaker 1>things that he said that were peaceful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that produced no emotional reaction from</v>

595
00:30:12.821 --> 00:30:14.440
<v Speaker 1>the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just said less of.</v>

596
00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:18.100
<v Speaker 1>And so the crowd taught him over time </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what to sell them.</v>

597
00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:21.670
<v Speaker 1>And that that can be good in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a leader does that carefully,</v>

598
00:30:21.671 --> 00:30:22.504
<v Speaker 1>that that means he's integrating what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the crowd wants with his style of </v>

599
00:30:25.991 --> 00:30:26.530
<v Speaker 1>leadership.</v>

600
00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:27.363
<v Speaker 1>But it can be terrible if the mob is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>crowd and the mob is outraged and out </v>

601
00:30:32.141 --> 00:30:32.974
<v Speaker 1>for blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happened in Nazi </v>

602
00:30:34.631 --> 00:30:36.820
<v Speaker 1>Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can't blame it on Hitler.</v>

603
00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:37.683
<v Speaker 1>That's just not reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's distributed through the entire </v>

604
00:30:39.641 --> 00:30:44.641
<v Speaker 1>population and the individual level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis that's most significant and a</v>

605
00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:48.453
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's malevolence that has to be </v>

606
00:30:49.361 --> 00:30:50.194
<v Speaker 1>contended with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other element is that you </v>

607
00:30:51.611 --> 00:30:53.890
<v Speaker 1>have to contend with the tragedy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

608
00:30:53.891 --> 00:30:54.724
<v Speaker 1>And that's so in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the passion of the Christ did that </v>

609
00:30:57.221 --> 00:30:59.800
<v Speaker 1>and that story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ of course encounters Satan in the</v>

610
00:30:59.801 --> 00:31:00.880
<v Speaker 1>desert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>

611
00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:01.803
<v Speaker 1>and he's tempted there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the encounter with evil </v>

612
00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:05.103
<v Speaker 1>archetypically speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the crucifixion itself is the </v>

613
00:31:07.541 --> 00:31:09.550
<v Speaker 1>encounter with the tragedy of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

614
00:31:09.551 --> 00:31:12.220
<v Speaker 1>It's betrayal and death voluntarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>accepted.</v>

615
00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:16.720
<v Speaker 1>And so I understood that that was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolic representation of the logos and</v>

616
00:31:16.721 --> 00:31:20.140
<v Speaker 1>that that was the they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

617
00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:20.973
<v Speaker 1>The embodied manifestation of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroic path that mediated between these </v>

618
00:31:24.971 --> 00:31:27.160
<v Speaker 1>two extremes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was really useful.</v>

619
00:31:27.161 --> 00:31:29.530
<v Speaker 1>Like that was a really useful discovery </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me.</v>

620
00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:32.130
<v Speaker 1>And because there was implications to it</v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

621
00:31:32.131 --> 00:31:32.964
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

622
00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:33.843
<v Speaker 1>and profound implications that also seem</v>
<v Speaker 1>to work out in relationship to what I </v>

623
00:31:37.151 --> 00:31:39.760
<v Speaker 1>was learning about clinical psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

624
00:31:39.761 --> 00:31:42.460
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you do if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical psychologist,</v>

625
00:31:42.461 --> 00:31:43.294
<v Speaker 1>as you help people learn to encounter </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that they're afraid of in a </v>

626
00:31:47.501 --> 00:31:50.680
<v Speaker 1>controlled manner and they get less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't get less afraid,</v>

627
00:31:50.681 --> 00:31:51.514
<v Speaker 1>they get braver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you actually act out the process of </v>

628
00:31:53.771 --> 00:31:54.604
<v Speaker 1>confrontation with tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntary conference question with </v>

629
00:31:56.591 --> 00:31:58.210
<v Speaker 1>tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's curative.</v>

630
00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.313
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if you're exposing </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to their past or the present or </v>

631
00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.010
<v Speaker 1>things they're worried about in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

632
00:32:03.011 --> 00:32:05.200
<v Speaker 1>As long as they decide to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily,</v>

633
00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.030
<v Speaker 1>they get stronger and better.</v>

634
00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:07.931
<v Speaker 1>So you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

635
00:32:07.931 --> 00:32:09.700
<v Speaker 1>what's the limit to that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

636
00:32:09.701 --> 00:32:10.534
<v Speaker 1>the limit is to accept the limitations </v>
<v Speaker 1>and catastrophes of your own mortality </v>

637
00:32:14.801 --> 00:32:15.634
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the potentially the proper </v>

638
00:32:18.281 --> 00:32:19.114
<v Speaker 1>pathway through life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least it's the least bad pathway </v>

639
00:32:22.091 --> 00:32:23.920
<v Speaker 1>through life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something,</v>

640
00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:24.783
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I think the same can be said </v>

641
00:32:26.351 --> 00:32:29.920
<v Speaker 1>fairly decisively for the willingness to</v>
<v Speaker 1>grapple with,</v>

642
00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:32.720
<v Speaker 1>with malevolence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

643
00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:35.180
<v Speaker 1>on a personal and individual level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

644
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:38.310
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started to lecture about that and,</v>

645
00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:40.790
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to lay out those ideas more and more</v>

646
00:32:40.791 --> 00:32:42.950
<v Speaker 1>clearly over the years as I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>lecturing.</v>

647
00:32:42.951 --> 00:32:47.690
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I did for TV Ontario.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's why the lectures</v>

648
00:32:47.691 --> 00:32:49.880
<v Speaker 1>became popular because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

649
00:32:49.881 --> 00:32:50.714
<v Speaker 1>I'd put some words to ideas that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>already knew and could revitalize a </v>

650
00:32:54.141 --> 00:32:57.590
<v Speaker 1>symbolic vocabulary that people had </v>
<v Speaker 1>become divorced from and,</v>

651
00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:01.820
<v Speaker 1>and that there was a hole in the culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly where those ideas needed to be.</v>

652
00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:05.000
<v Speaker 1>And so people found that they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

653
00:33:05.001 --> 00:33:06.740
<v Speaker 1>people tell me when they come and talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

654
00:33:06.741 --> 00:33:07.574
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

655
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.170
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

656
00:33:09.171 --> 00:33:12.110
<v Speaker 1>I already know what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't have the words for it.</v>

657
00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:13.191
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

658
00:33:13.191 --> 00:33:17.600
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what archetipal story is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is that you all know the story.</v>

659
00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:18.493
<v Speaker 1>You just don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it or you know at a level that </v>

660
00:33:20.751 --> 00:33:21.584
<v Speaker 1>you can't articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you still recognize it when you see </v>

661
00:33:24.711 --> 00:33:27.110
<v Speaker 1>it and you still act it out and you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>it in other people.</v>

662
00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:28.550
<v Speaker 1>But it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

663
00:33:28.551 --> 00:33:32.840
<v Speaker 1>really good to have the words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why you should be very</v>

664
00:33:32.841 --> 00:33:33.674
<v Speaker 1>careful about what you say and </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly careful about what you </v>

665
00:33:36.381 --> 00:33:41.381
<v Speaker 1>right now anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the big ideas thing won't act,</v>

666
00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:43.813
<v Speaker 1>came into my classes and tape maps of </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning and made 1330 minutes or TV </v>

667
00:33:47.991 --> 00:33:49.040
<v Speaker 1>shows out of them.</v>

668
00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:49.873
<v Speaker 1>And that was pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were broadcast and kind of </v>

669
00:33:52.701 --> 00:33:56.120
<v Speaker 1>evanescent because at that point they </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't put on the web.</v>

670
00:33:56.121 --> 00:33:58.250
<v Speaker 1>So they're broadcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pretty much disappear.</v>

671
00:33:58.251 --> 00:33:59.510
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

672
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:02.330
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

673
00:34:02.331 --> 00:34:03.320
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fine.</v>

674
00:34:03.321 --> 00:34:06.110
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I got some degree of,</v>

675
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:09.890
<v Speaker 1>what would you say I got?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was exposed,</v>

676
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:12.290
<v Speaker 1>my ideas were exposed to a large number </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people,</v>

677
00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.630
<v Speaker 1>tens of thousands of people as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that.</v>

678
00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:16.003
<v Speaker 1>And that seemed to go pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then youtube came along and I </v>

679
00:34:19.041 --> 00:34:21.860
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

680
00:34:21.861 --> 00:34:23.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this youtube thing,</v>

681
00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:27.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the comments section makes you like,</v>

682
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:31.100
<v Speaker 1>what would you say wary about being </v>
<v Speaker 1>human?</v>

683
00:34:31.101 --> 00:34:34.880
<v Speaker 1>I would say generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know there was a lot of,</v>

684
00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:37.453
<v Speaker 1>well there were a lot of things that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be easy to be contemptuous of on </v>

685
00:34:39.861 --> 00:34:43.100
<v Speaker 1>Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the canonical cute cat videos.</v>

686
00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:48.080
<v Speaker 1>But I'm actually not so contempt chew us</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that or the interesting animal videos</v>

687
00:34:48.081 --> 00:34:48.914
<v Speaker 1>because I think they actually speak to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of people that's actually quite </v>

688
00:34:51.861 --> 00:34:53.210
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We liked cats,</v>

689
00:34:53.211 --> 00:34:55.400
<v Speaker 1>we like dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think animals are kind of cool.</v>

690
00:34:55.401 --> 00:34:57.590
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we take a break and look at,</v>

691
00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:01.040
<v Speaker 1>look at something that's pleasant and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cute and maybe that's not so bad.</v>

692
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:04.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly not malevolent.</v>

693
00:35:04.341 --> 00:35:07.640
<v Speaker 1>And that's something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought,</v>

694
00:35:07.641 --> 00:35:08.474
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'll find these old videos I did </v>

695
00:35:10.551 --> 00:35:15.110
<v Speaker 1>for Tvo and I'll put them up on youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe I'll just take my classes.</v>

696
00:35:15.111 --> 00:35:15.944
<v Speaker 1>And so I set up a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I have this theory that if it's </v>

697
00:35:17.961 --> 00:35:19.820
<v Speaker 1>worth doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worth doing badly,</v>

698
00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:21.980
<v Speaker 1>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's true,</v>

699
00:35:21.981 --> 00:35:24.050
<v Speaker 1>but it's also true that if it's worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

700
00:35:24.051 --> 00:35:24.884
<v Speaker 1>it's worth doing well and you just need </v>
<v Speaker 1>to know when to apply those two </v>

701
00:35:27.381 --> 00:35:28.214
<v Speaker 1>principles.</v>

702
00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:31.850
<v Speaker 1>And if you're loath to do something and </v>
<v Speaker 1>procrastinating,</v>

703
00:35:31.851 --> 00:35:33.680
<v Speaker 1>then sometimes it's better to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>badly.</v>

704
00:35:33.681 --> 00:35:34.514
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I can't get a whole production </v>

705
00:35:35.931 --> 00:35:38.700
<v Speaker 1>studio up and running cause I just don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the time.</v>

706
00:35:38.701 --> 00:35:39.534
<v Speaker 1>I'll get an IPAD and learn to use it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>get an level ear mic and just set the </v>

707
00:35:44.551 --> 00:35:46.530
<v Speaker 1>thing up or maybe have a student film </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

708
00:35:46.531 --> 00:35:51.531
<v Speaker 1>And so I did that for a couple of years </v>
<v Speaker 1>for my personality class in this maps of</v>

709
00:35:51.751 --> 00:35:52.584
<v Speaker 1>meaning class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the class where I outlined the </v>

710
00:35:54.011 --> 00:35:55.950
<v Speaker 1>sorts of ideas that I just described to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

711
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.863
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last April I noticed that I'd had a </v>

712
00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:03.780
<v Speaker 1>million views and about 15,000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>subscribers,</v>

713
00:36:03.781 --> 00:36:05.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought,</v>

714
00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:07.080
<v Speaker 1>huh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million views,</v>

715
00:36:07.081 --> 00:36:09.630
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an actually a lot of views.</v>

716
00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:10.643
<v Speaker 1>It's like if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never write a scientific paper </v>

717
00:36:12.481 --> 00:36:14.850
<v Speaker 1>that's been read a million times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one has,</v>

718
00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:16.410
<v Speaker 1>that just never happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

719
00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:18.900
<v Speaker 1>That's happened zero times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it,</v>

720
00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.360
<v Speaker 1>if you have a paper that's cited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

721
00:36:21.361 --> 00:36:24.780
<v Speaker 1>someone else refers to it and one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their scientific papers a hundred times,</v>

722
00:36:24.781 --> 00:36:28.500
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's a home run and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand times is a miracle.</v>

723
00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.870
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then if you write a book,</v>

724
00:36:30.871 --> 00:36:34.380
<v Speaker 1>you know there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think 1.2 million books published last</v>

725
00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:35.250
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

726
00:36:35.251 --> 00:36:38.430
<v Speaker 1>And I think 500 of them sold more than a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred thousand copies.</v>

727
00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.830
<v Speaker 1>So that's a sea of books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

728
00:36:40.831 --> 00:36:41.664
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an ocean of books and all of them </v>

729
00:36:43.651 --> 00:36:45.630
<v Speaker 1>fail it really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

730
00:36:45.631 --> 00:36:46.464
<v Speaker 1>so many of them fail that you might as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well never write a book because the </v>

731
00:36:48.691 --> 00:36:53.691
<v Speaker 1>probability that it will fail is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>99.99% and that would be very depressing</v>

732
00:36:54.751 --> 00:36:58.290
<v Speaker 1>if it wasn't the case that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case for anything creative you ever do.</v>

733
00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:01.500
<v Speaker 1>So it's just baseline probability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I thought,</v>

734
00:37:01.501 --> 00:37:02.334
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I wrote a book and it sold a million </v>

735
00:37:03.151 --> 00:37:03.841
<v Speaker 1>copies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

736
00:37:03.841 --> 00:37:05.370
<v Speaker 1>I'd be out dancing in the street.</v>

737
00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:06.870
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not.</v>

738
00:37:06.871 --> 00:37:08.880
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the idea.</v>

739
00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:12.000
<v Speaker 1>So what does it mean to have a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube views?</v>

740
00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:13.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the hell knows?</v>

741
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:14.933
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

742
00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:15.923
<v Speaker 1>we don't have metrics for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what sort of influence </v>

743
00:37:17.851 --> 00:37:19.950
<v Speaker 1>that's having.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know anything about that.</v>

744
00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.020
<v Speaker 1>We don't know whether we should take it </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously or,</v>

745
00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:25.020
<v Speaker 1>or if it's or who you're talking to or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

746
00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:27.390
<v Speaker 1>But I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well still it's a million.</v>

747
00:37:27.391 --> 00:37:29.700
<v Speaker 1>And that's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

748
00:37:29.701 --> 00:37:30.534
<v Speaker 1>well maybe this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is more serious thing than I </v>

749
00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:37.760
<v Speaker 1>initially envisioned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I really thought about it and I</v>

750
00:37:37.771 --> 00:37:38.604
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

751
00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:39.700
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

752
00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:40.870
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

753
00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Here's a hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

754
00:37:43.451 --> 00:37:45.930
<v Speaker 1>back in the medieval times and before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

755
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.670
<v Speaker 1>if you wanted to book someone had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>copy it by hand.</v>

756
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:52.000
<v Speaker 1>And so there weren't many books and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were very expensive.</v>

757
00:37:52.001 --> 00:37:52.834
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then Gutenberg came along and </v>

758
00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:56.950
<v Speaker 1>invented the movable type press and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

759
00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:57.843
<v Speaker 1>poof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Books were inexpensive and everybody </v>

760
00:37:59.741 --> 00:38:00.574
<v Speaker 1>could have them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not like was that was a major </v>

761
00:38:01.601 --> 00:38:02.470
<v Speaker 1>revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

762
00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:06.280
<v Speaker 1>It within 400 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost everyone in the western world and</v>

763
00:38:06.281 --> 00:38:07.114
<v Speaker 1>then very rapidly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost everyone in the entire world was </v>

764
00:38:09.641 --> 00:38:12.250
<v Speaker 1>literate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could read silently even,</v>

765
00:38:12.251 --> 00:38:13.084
<v Speaker 1>which was something that before that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>reserved for a very small number of </v>

766
00:38:15.761 --> 00:38:18.550
<v Speaker 1>people because most people read out loud</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they read it all.</v>

767
00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:22.270
<v Speaker 1>So that was a massive revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought,</v>

768
00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:25.900
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe youtube is a Gutenberg revolution</v>

769
00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:28.313
<v Speaker 1>because it allows the spoken word to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the same reach and longevity as a </v>

770
00:38:33.391 --> 00:38:34.930
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

771
00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.153
<v Speaker 1>For the first time in human history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spontaneous speeches can reach an </v>

772
00:38:41.111 --> 00:38:46.111
<v Speaker 1>infinite audience for eye,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for an unspecified duration of time.</v>

773
00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:48.190
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a whole new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

774
00:38:48.191 --> 00:38:49.024
<v Speaker 1>that's an entirely new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it's easier for people to </v>

775
00:38:51.911 --> 00:38:54.910
<v Speaker 1>listen than it is for them to read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

776
00:38:54.911 --> 00:38:55.744
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather read than listen cause I can </v>

777
00:38:56.741 --> 00:38:57.574
<v Speaker 1>read way faster than I can listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people will listen to a youtube </v>

778
00:39:00.491 --> 00:39:03.100
<v Speaker 1>video at twice the normal speed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes more.</v>

779
00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:07.600
<v Speaker 1>So you can circumvent that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then also with a youtube video,</v>

780
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:10.000
<v Speaker 1>if you convert it into a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

781
00:39:10.001 --> 00:39:10.834
<v Speaker 1>which I'll get to to a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you all of a sudden have way more time </v>

782
00:39:13.781 --> 00:39:14.614
<v Speaker 1>than you used to have because you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to a podcast while you're doing </v>

783
00:39:18.281 --> 00:39:19.150
<v Speaker 1>other things.</v>

784
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:20.103
<v Speaker 1>So you can do mundane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mundane things that you have to do </v>

785
00:39:21.971 --> 00:39:24.310
<v Speaker 1>from day to day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like commute and so on.</v>

786
00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:28.360
<v Speaker 1>But you can listen to a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've found that my students,</v>

787
00:39:28.361 --> 00:39:33.100
<v Speaker 1>my young students are now listening to </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts instead of music.</v>

788
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:35.200
<v Speaker 1>And that's really something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

789
00:39:35.201 --> 00:39:36.034
<v Speaker 1>because music of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been an unbelievably dynamic </v>

790
00:39:38.171 --> 00:39:39.004
<v Speaker 1>cultural force for maybe the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the primary artistic cultural force for </v>

791
00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:48.160
<v Speaker 1>what maybe maybe since the 1950s </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>

792
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:51.700
<v Speaker 1>And that's being supplanted to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree by podcasts.</v>

793
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:52.833
<v Speaker 1>And that's really something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it also turns out that people </v>

794
00:39:54.371 --> 00:39:55.204
<v Speaker 1>have an appetite for long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>detailed podcasts that are deep and </v>

795
00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:01.330
<v Speaker 1>informative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

796
00:40:01.331 --> 00:40:03.610
<v Speaker 1>who the hell would've guessed that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like no one,</v>

797
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:06.460
<v Speaker 1>it's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just sort of came out of nowhere.</v>

798
00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:07.931
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

799
00:40:07.931 --> 00:40:08.764
<v Speaker 1>maybe this is worth taking seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like at the same time I was </v>

800
00:40:14.321 --> 00:40:15.154
<v Speaker 1>interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always been interested in </v>

801
00:40:16.241 --> 00:40:18.160
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneur types and creative types.</v>

802
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:19.023
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're high in this big five </v>

803
00:40:19.901 --> 00:40:20.734
<v Speaker 1>personality trait called openness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there the people from whom all </v>

804
00:40:23.951 --> 00:40:24.784
<v Speaker 1>innovation flows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very hard for creative people </v>

805
00:40:27.161 --> 00:40:27.994
<v Speaker 1>to monetize their create creation </v>
<v Speaker 1>because to monetize something you have </v>

806
00:40:31.241 --> 00:40:34.930
<v Speaker 1>to have the idea and then you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>translate it into a product and then you</v>

807
00:40:34.931 --> 00:40:37.390
<v Speaker 1>have to bring it to market and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to sell it.</v>

808
00:40:37.391 --> 00:40:41.140
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to develop customer </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships and customer support.</v>

809
00:40:41.141 --> 00:40:43.090
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time you do all that,</v>

810
00:40:43.091 --> 00:40:45.040
<v Speaker 1>if you're going creative person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're either,</v>

811
00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:49.120
<v Speaker 1>you've either been bought out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shunted to the side or you're dead,</v>

812
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:51.420
<v Speaker 1>so you don't get to have the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

813
00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:54.110
<v Speaker 1>you produce the value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't monetize it.</v>

814
00:40:54.111 --> 00:40:55.740
<v Speaker 1>And it's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

815
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:58.930
<v Speaker 1>it's why it's so frustrating to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative person often,</v>

816
00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:00.243
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

817
00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:01.773
<v Speaker 1>so I was looking around for ways that </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative people could monetize their </v>

818
00:41:04.181 --> 00:41:05.014
<v Speaker 1>production online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly because I'm like far too curious </v>

819
00:41:09.101 --> 00:41:10.810
<v Speaker 1>for my own good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

820
00:41:10.811 --> 00:41:13.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife went off to visit her,</v>

821
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:15.220
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

822
00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:15.961
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

823
00:41:15.961 --> 00:41:19.300
<v Speaker 1>her father for about a week can I had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of time,</v>

824
00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:20.303
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could stay up until three in the </v>

825
00:41:21.041 --> 00:41:23.440
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I shouldn't do and work.</v>

826
00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:27.490
<v Speaker 1>And I found a site called Patriot and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Patriot allowed,</v>

827
00:41:27.491 --> 00:41:28.324
<v Speaker 1>you know how patrion works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It allows people to make voluntary </v>

828
00:41:29.951 --> 00:41:34.220
<v Speaker 1>donations to support creative people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are basically usually</v>

829
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:36.380
<v Speaker 1>making their work available for free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

830
00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:37.940
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's pretty interesting.</v>

831
00:41:37.941 --> 00:41:42.020
<v Speaker 1>It's appealing to the basic human desire</v>
<v Speaker 1>for reciprocity.</v>

832
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:44.750
<v Speaker 1>Like people actually don't like getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>something for nothing.</v>

833
00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:47.300
<v Speaker 1>It kind of puts them in existential </v>
<v Speaker 1>debt.</v>

834
00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:48.373
<v Speaker 1>And so they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people generally feel that if they've </v>

835
00:41:49.491 --> 00:41:50.324
<v Speaker 1>received something of value that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would like to give something of value </v>

836
00:41:52.491 --> 00:41:53.241
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

837
00:41:53.241 --> 00:41:54.860
<v Speaker 1>not everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most people,</v>

838
00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:56.390
<v Speaker 1>most people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

839
00:41:56.391 --> 00:41:57.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>

840
00:41:57.581 --> 00:42:00.350
<v Speaker 1>I'll set up the Patriot account and see </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens.</v>

841
00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:04.100
<v Speaker 1>So it took me about like six hours or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that to figure out how to</v>

842
00:42:04.101 --> 00:42:04.950
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

843
00:42:04.951 --> 00:42:09.951
<v Speaker 1>And how to make a little what a banner </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the youtube videos that was linked to</v>

844
00:42:10.221 --> 00:42:11.054
<v Speaker 1>the Patriot account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was all sorts of little weird </v>

845
00:42:12.231 --> 00:42:14.090
<v Speaker 1>tricks that you had to learn behind the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenes.</v>

846
00:42:14.091 --> 00:42:15.260
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

847
00:42:15.261 --> 00:42:16.580
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll see what happens.</v>

848
00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:20.990
<v Speaker 1>And then at the end of that month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had about 50,</v>

849
00:42:20.991 --> 00:42:24.500
<v Speaker 1>60 subscribers and about $500 us a </v>
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>

850
00:42:24.501 --> 00:42:25.340
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh,</v>

851
00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:28.070
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

852
00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:30.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to make of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I could take that money and increase</v>

853
00:42:30.861 --> 00:42:32.270
<v Speaker 1>the production quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

854
00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:33.363
<v Speaker 1>if that keeps happening and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll just run this and keep seeing </v>

855
00:42:36.171 --> 00:42:37.850
<v Speaker 1>how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

856
00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:39.980
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was pretty interesting.</v>

857
00:42:39.981 --> 00:42:43.760
<v Speaker 1>And so I had thought through what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>meant,</v>

858
00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:44.653
<v Speaker 1>what youtube meant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was a Gutenberg revolution and </v>

859
00:42:46.451 --> 00:42:47.284
<v Speaker 1>that deserve to be taken seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I found this platform for </v>

860
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:51.643
<v Speaker 1>monetization for creative people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the two things were married and </v>

861
00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:55.573
<v Speaker 1>that was April last year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then at the same time I was writing </v>

862
00:42:59.601 --> 00:43:01.610
<v Speaker 1>a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is called 12 rules for life.</v>

863
00:43:01.611 --> 00:43:05.360
<v Speaker 1>And some of you may have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or there's some flyers that are going to</v>

864
00:43:05.361 --> 00:43:07.370
<v Speaker 1>be distributed that tell you about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

865
00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:08.203
<v Speaker 1>But in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading this chapter in the book </v>

866
00:43:10.101 --> 00:43:12.290
<v Speaker 1>called don't bother children when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're skateboarding.</v>

867
00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:17.540
<v Speaker 1>And it took me deep into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>polarization of society because I wasn't</v>

868
00:43:17.541 --> 00:43:18.374
<v Speaker 1>very happy about the fact that children </v>
<v Speaker 1>are overprotected and that adventurous </v>

869
00:43:21.621 --> 00:43:22.454
<v Speaker 1>children like skateboarders for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are often shut down when they're </v>

870
00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:28.730
<v Speaker 1>manifesting their bravery and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupidity often.</v>

871
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:31.700
<v Speaker 1>But that's not always distinguishable </v>
<v Speaker 1>from bravery.</v>

872
00:43:31.701 --> 00:43:32.534
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you you,</v>

873
00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:36.350
<v Speaker 1>that's like the trickster figure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan was talking about earlier.</v>

874
00:43:36.351 --> 00:43:37.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>

875
00:43:37.090 --> 00:43:37.923
<v Speaker 1>it's not always that easy to segregate </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who take unrealistic or </v>

876
00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:42.073
<v Speaker 1>unreasonable risks from those who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>courageously extending their competence </v>

877
00:43:45.471 --> 00:43:47.930
<v Speaker 1>into the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>

878
00:43:47.931 --> 00:43:51.470
<v Speaker 1>for reasons I won't tell you about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>took me deep into the,</v>

879
00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:54.620
<v Speaker 1>into the political polarization </v>
<v Speaker 1>landscape with,</v>

880
00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:55.290
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

881
00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:56.123
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the increasing tension between the </v>

882
00:43:57.261 --> 00:43:58.094
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is becoming increasingly </v>

883
00:43:59.541 --> 00:44:00.950
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian and the right.</v>

884
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:02.030
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

885
00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:05.660
<v Speaker 1>and also with what seems to be something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an assault on,</v>

886
00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:08.330
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan called it the logos,</v>

887
00:44:08.331 --> 00:44:12.440
<v Speaker 1>which I think is exactly right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a reflection of niches,</v>

888
00:44:12.441 --> 00:44:15.020
<v Speaker 1>death of God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and an assault on masculinity,</v>

889
00:44:15.021 --> 00:44:19.140
<v Speaker 1>which is often now seen as toxic or part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the oppressive patriarchy,</v>

890
00:44:19.141 --> 00:44:21.200
<v Speaker 1>really part patriarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

891
00:44:21.201 --> 00:44:22.034
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this was kind of making my blood </v>

892
00:44:23.991 --> 00:44:27.230
<v Speaker 1>boil while I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while I was writing this,</v>

893
00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:28.093
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you get tangled up in that and </v>

894
00:44:29.601 --> 00:44:32.430
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of emotionally distressing.</v>

895
00:44:32.431 --> 00:44:35.100
<v Speaker 1>And I saw the spread of these sorts of</v>

896
00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:38.653
<v Speaker 1>radical leftist ideas through campus and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought we'd killed all that off back </v>

897
00:44:42.501 --> 00:44:43.820
<v Speaker 1>in the 1990s.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

898
00:44:43.821 --> 00:44:47.180
<v Speaker 1>there was a spike of political </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctness and about 92.</v>

899
00:44:47.181 --> 00:44:48.014
<v Speaker 1>And I was in Boston at that point and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of got pushed back and it </v>

900
00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:52.400
<v Speaker 1>disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

901
00:44:52.401 --> 00:44:53.211
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's good,</v>

902
00:44:53.211 --> 00:44:54.044
<v Speaker 1>that's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the economy boomed like mad in </v>

903
00:44:56.361 --> 00:44:58.970
<v Speaker 1>the u s and people had other things to </v>
<v Speaker 1>concern themselves with.</v>

904
00:44:58.971 --> 00:45:00.530
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

905
00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:02.270
<v Speaker 1>three years ago or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

906
00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:05.690
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is back with a vengeance.</v>

907
00:45:05.691 --> 00:45:10.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like we ain't seen nothing yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that was bothering me.</v>

908
00:45:10.251 --> 00:45:11.084
<v Speaker 1>And then in my clinical practice I had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of clients who had been bullied </v>

909
00:45:13.671 --> 00:45:14.504
<v Speaker 1>into poor states of mental health by </v>
<v Speaker 1>social justice warrior types at three </v>

910
00:45:18.111 --> 00:45:20.750
<v Speaker 1>different workplaces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were quite different people.</v>

911
00:45:20.751 --> 00:45:22.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the more left leaning,</v>

912
00:45:22.581 --> 00:45:25.390
<v Speaker 1>some of the more right leaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all had the same stories.</v>

913
00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:26.293
<v Speaker 1>They were sensible people and now they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were required to do things at their </v>

914
00:45:29.661 --> 00:45:31.970
<v Speaker 1>workplace that they just couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerate doing.</v>

915
00:45:31.971 --> 00:45:34.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sensitivity training or unconscious</v>

916
00:45:34.251 --> 00:45:36.990
<v Speaker 1>bias training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or here's one story.</v>

917
00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:37.843
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this woman is this woman that I was </v>

918
00:45:40.251 --> 00:45:43.250
<v Speaker 1>working with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the stupidest story.</v>

919
00:45:43.251 --> 00:45:44.084
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't even believe it except she </v>
<v Speaker 1>showed me all the emails she worked at </v>

920
00:45:46.971 --> 00:45:50.300
<v Speaker 1>this large bureaucracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll leave it at that.</v>

921
00:45:50.301 --> 00:45:54.200
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people at the bureaucracy would make</v>

922
00:45:54.201 --> 00:45:55.760
<v Speaker 1>presentations with those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

923
00:45:55.761 --> 00:45:58.790
<v Speaker 1>those boards that you can set up that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have big pads of paper on them?</v>

924
00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:00.133
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those pads of paper that you can flip </v>

925
00:46:01.581 --> 00:46:03.920
<v Speaker 1>are called flip charts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

926
00:46:03.921 --> 00:46:04.754
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somebody got it into their head and </v>

927
00:46:06.831 --> 00:46:09.500
<v Speaker 1>this was the manager of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this particular client.</v>

928
00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:14.770
<v Speaker 1>That flip was a racist term because </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently you can call Filipinos flip.</v>

929
00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:17.420
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

930
00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:18.253
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so flip chart is actually insulting </v>

931
00:46:20.301 --> 00:46:22.520
<v Speaker 1>to Filipinos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

932
00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:23.773
<v Speaker 1>and so then she showed me this string of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 30 emails that had gone back and </v>

933
00:46:27.231 --> 00:46:31.040
<v Speaker 1>forth within her company from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>management and a bunch of people,</v>

934
00:46:31.041 --> 00:46:32.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that jen,</v>

935
00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:34.940
<v Speaker 1>the typical suspects who are all </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned about this.</v>

936
00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:37.670
<v Speaker 1>And they ended up banning the word flip </v>
<v Speaker 1>chart.</v>

937
00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:39.890
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was coming to talk to me saying,</v>

938
00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:43.160
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is actually driving me crazy.</v>

939
00:46:43.161 --> 00:46:43.994
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe this is that people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>spending their time doing this and that </v>

940
00:46:47.721 --> 00:46:51.860
<v Speaker 1>we're required to assent to it as if it </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't insane,</v>

941
00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:54.650
<v Speaker 1>which of course it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

942
00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:59.110
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then then</v>

943
00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:00.193
<v Speaker 1>I got wind of bill see 16 and I'd been </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking into the Ontario human rights </v>

944
00:47:05.301 --> 00:47:10.301
<v Speaker 1>commission already at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I wasn't very happy with the Ontario</v>

945
00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:11.533
<v Speaker 1>Human Rights Commission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there it's fascist organization </v>

946
00:47:13.491 --> 00:47:15.860
<v Speaker 1>masquerading under the guise of </v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion,</v>

947
00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:17.053
<v Speaker 1>which is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very typical in and and very </v>

948
00:47:18.861 --> 00:47:19.694
<v Speaker 1>intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're going to be a power </v>

949
00:47:21.081 --> 00:47:24.500
<v Speaker 1>hungry or authoritarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who wants sensorial control,</v>

950
00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:25.483
<v Speaker 1>the best way to allow yourself to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to look at yourself in the mirror </v>

951
00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:31.660
<v Speaker 1>without screaming is to wear a mask of </v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion,</v>

952
00:47:31.661 --> 00:47:33.350
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what I think's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

953
00:47:33.351 --> 00:47:34.184
<v Speaker 1>And Bill [inaudible] came out and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>purported to add transgender rights to </v>

954
00:47:39.191 --> 00:47:40.024
<v Speaker 1>the list of protected rights in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canadian human rights code and in the </v>

955
00:47:42.941 --> 00:47:43.774
<v Speaker 1>criminal code.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like it was one of those Trojan </v>

956
00:47:46.331 --> 00:47:48.730
<v Speaker 1>horses that Bret Weinstein just talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

957
00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:51.520
<v Speaker 1>You read the legislation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only two paragraphs long.</v>

958
00:47:51.521 --> 00:47:52.301
<v Speaker 1>You Think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

959
00:47:52.301 --> 00:47:53.134
<v Speaker 1>Canadians are being nice to people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know are in a strange category and </v>

960
00:47:56.351 --> 00:47:57.130
<v Speaker 1>get oppressed.</v>

961
00:47:57.130 --> 00:47:58.870
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the surface of it.</v>

962
00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:03.250
<v Speaker 1>But then I went back and I read all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they said on the federal website</v>

963
00:48:03.251 --> 00:48:04.084
<v Speaker 1>that it would be interpreted in </v>
<v Speaker 1>accordance with the policies developed </v>

964
00:48:06.431 --> 00:48:07.264
<v Speaker 1>by the Ontario Human Rights Commission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went read those policies and I </v>

965
00:48:09.851 --> 00:48:11.200
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

966
00:48:11.770 --> 00:48:13.780
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were completely incoherent.</v>

967
00:48:13.781 --> 00:48:15.520
<v Speaker 1>They were extraordinarily poorly </v>
<v Speaker 1>written.</v>

968
00:48:15.521 --> 00:48:16.354
<v Speaker 1>They were philosophically appalling and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't have been designed to get </v>

969
00:48:20.111 --> 00:48:23.230
<v Speaker 1>more people in trouble if that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been the purpose of the design.</v>

970
00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:25.270
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a business owner,</v>

971
00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:27.370
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not pro capitalists,</v>

972
00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:29.380
<v Speaker 1>let's put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a business owner,</v>

973
00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:32.200
<v Speaker 1>you are as responsible for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>utterances of their,</v>

974
00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:35.950
<v Speaker 1>of your employees as if you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>uttering them yourself.</v>

975
00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:38.650
<v Speaker 1>If the employee's utterance caused </v>
<v Speaker 1>offense,</v>

976
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:42.640
<v Speaker 1>whether or not they meant the offense </v>
<v Speaker 1>and whether or not there was any offense</v>

977
00:48:42.641 --> 00:48:45.430
<v Speaker 1>taken on the part of the person that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>being offended.</v>

978
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:47.290
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my God.</v>

979
00:48:47.590 --> 00:48:49.000
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really the,</v>

980
00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:51.810
<v Speaker 1>that's really the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was like one of,</v>

981
00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:52.863
<v Speaker 1>and there was another rule in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was that the Ontario human rights </v>

982
00:48:55.091 --> 00:48:58.030
<v Speaker 1>commission could suspend </v>
<v Speaker 1>jurisprudential,</v>

983
00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:01.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition in pursuit of their goals.</v>

984
00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:03.250
<v Speaker 1>It was like clause 13 eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know,</v>

985
00:49:03.251 --> 00:49:04.160
<v Speaker 1>just 13,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight.</v>

986
00:49:04.161 --> 00:49:07.600
<v Speaker 1>It's just a little clause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can ignore all legal precedent.</v>

987
00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:10.390
<v Speaker 1>So I was reading this and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell,</v>

988
00:49:10.391 --> 00:49:13.780
<v Speaker 1>this is absolutely insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then at the same time,</v>

989
00:49:13.781 --> 00:49:17.650
<v Speaker 1>the university hr department and Equity </v>
<v Speaker 1>Reit equity,</v>

990
00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:18.300
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

991
00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:20.230
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear that word,</v>

992
00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:24.880
<v Speaker 1>you're someone utters that word and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know they're ideologically possessed.</v>

993
00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:26.980
<v Speaker 1>So you move away from them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

994
00:49:26.981 --> 00:49:29.950
<v Speaker 1>You move away from them because equity </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a terrible,</v>

995
00:49:29.951 --> 00:49:32.500
<v Speaker 1>it's a terrible word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those words that masquerades</v>

996
00:49:32.501 --> 00:49:35.830
<v Speaker 1>as compassionate is a dreadful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible word.</v>

997
00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:41.460
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the HR and equity department had decided</v>

998
00:49:41.561 --> 00:49:42.310
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

999
00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:43.143
<v Speaker 1>the university was rife with systemic </v>
<v Speaker 1>racism and that was all implicit in our </v>

1000
00:49:46.871 --> 00:49:49.840
<v Speaker 1>unconscious biases and that all the h </v>
<v Speaker 1>and l,</v>

1001
00:49:49.841 --> 00:49:53.260
<v Speaker 1>all the staff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hr staff would have to undergo mandatory</v>

1002
00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:55.480
<v Speaker 1>unconscious bias retraining.</v>

1003
00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:57.490
<v Speaker 1>Well then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1004
00:49:57.491 --> 00:49:58.690
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1005
00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:00.340
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

1006
00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:01.413
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're using the implicit association </v>

1007
00:50:03.011 --> 00:50:04.120
<v Speaker 1>test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1008
00:50:04.121 --> 00:50:06.010
<v Speaker 1>And actually I could tell you a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit about that test,</v>

1009
00:50:06.011 --> 00:50:11.011
<v Speaker 1>but only tell you a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>to use a test to diagnose it individual,</v>

1010
00:50:11.471 --> 00:50:14.800
<v Speaker 1>the test has to pass certain standards </v>
<v Speaker 1>of reliability,</v>

1011
00:50:14.801 --> 00:50:17.830
<v Speaker 1>which means it measures the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>within the same individual.</v>

1012
00:50:17.831 --> 00:50:18.664
<v Speaker 1>The same way across time because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like otherwise you have a ruler that's </v>

1013
00:50:21.731 --> 00:50:23.950
<v Speaker 1>made out of rubber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not helpful,</v>

1014
00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:24.843
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to produce the same results with </v>

1015
00:50:26.471 --> 00:50:27.304
<v Speaker 1>repeated administrations and it has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>predict behavior in a way that's </v>

1016
00:50:31.281 --> 00:50:34.220
<v Speaker 1>consistent and with some degree of </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

1017
00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:37.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the IAT is not reliable,</v>

1018
00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:41.570
<v Speaker 1>not nearly reliable enough to be used as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a diagnostic instrument,</v>

1019
00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:46.670
<v Speaker 1>and it's not particularly valid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It predicts a little bit of behavior,</v>

1020
00:50:46.671 --> 00:50:50.660
<v Speaker 1>but not much like a fragment of behavior</v>
<v Speaker 1>may be enough to even have a significant</v>

1021
00:50:50.661 --> 00:50:52.400
<v Speaker 1>effect from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from time to time,</v>

1022
00:50:52.401 --> 00:50:56.510
<v Speaker 1>but it's a small fraction like so your </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious biases,</v>

1023
00:50:56.511 --> 00:51:00.650
<v Speaker 1>which are actually indistinguishable </v>
<v Speaker 1>from your perceptions or maybe even your</v>

1024
00:51:00.651 --> 00:51:04.370
<v Speaker 1>ingroup favoritism and people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized by in group favoritism,</v>

1025
00:51:04.371 --> 00:51:05.204
<v Speaker 1>which is why we like our families and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not easily distinguishable from </v>

1026
00:51:08.151 --> 00:51:11.240
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from your reaction to novelty as well,</v>

1027
00:51:11.241 --> 00:51:12.074
<v Speaker 1>because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your implicit racial prejudice under </v>

1028
00:51:13.971 --> 00:51:14.804
<v Speaker 1>some conditions is indistinguishable </v>
<v Speaker 1>from your preference for familiarity </v>

1029
00:51:17.811 --> 00:51:18.680
<v Speaker 1>over novelty.</v>

1030
00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:19.753
<v Speaker 1>So like the psych,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychological community is by no </v>

1031
00:51:22.731 --> 00:51:27.170
<v Speaker 1>means united on what the implicit </v>
<v Speaker 1>association test means by no means.</v>

1032
00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:28.213
<v Speaker 1>And it has plenty of severe critics and </v>
<v Speaker 1>even the people who have produced it </v>

1033
00:51:32.751 --> 00:51:35.240
<v Speaker 1>admit that it shouldn't be used for </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnostic purposes.</v>

1034
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:36.171
<v Speaker 1>Wink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wink,</v>

1035
00:51:36.171 --> 00:51:37.850
<v Speaker 1>wink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1036
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:41.450
<v Speaker 1>and then there is no evidence whatsoever</v>
<v Speaker 1>that unconscious bias retraining,</v>

1037
00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:43.970
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's mandatory eat first </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all,</v>

1038
00:51:43.971 --> 00:51:44.804
<v Speaker 1>reduces unconscious bias,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you can't measure very well </v>

1039
00:51:46.581 --> 00:51:50.570
<v Speaker 1>anyways or has any positive effect on </v>
<v Speaker 1>explicit behavior.</v>

1040
00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:54.860
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the attempt by the HR department to make</v>

1041
00:51:54.861 --> 00:51:55.694
<v Speaker 1>that mandatory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an unwarranted intrusion on the </v>

1042
00:51:58.101 --> 00:52:01.670
<v Speaker 1>civil rights of the employees using </v>
<v Speaker 1>pseudoscience as a mask.</v>

1043
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.983
<v Speaker 1>And so I was thinking about these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>at like two in the morning and I </v>

1044
00:52:05.511 --> 00:52:06.410
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1045
00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:11.150
<v Speaker 1>I can't sleep and I learned when I can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep to go right.</v>

1046
00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:12.420
<v Speaker 1>And this time I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1047
00:52:12.421 --> 00:52:13.254
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to write this down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make youtube videos </v>

1048
00:52:14.631 --> 00:52:16.280
<v Speaker 1>instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see what happens.</v>

1049
00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:21.313
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I sat in front of my computer and I </v>

1050
00:52:25.071 --> 00:52:29.810
<v Speaker 1>made these like low quality videos and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the content was pretty good.</v>

1051
00:52:29.811 --> 00:52:31.910
<v Speaker 1>I laid out why I was irritated about </v>
<v Speaker 1>bill,</v>

1052
00:52:31.911 --> 00:52:35.420
<v Speaker 1>see 16 and talked about the background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1053
00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:40.190
<v Speaker 1>context of the legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I made another one come telling</v>

1054
00:52:40.191 --> 00:52:41.024
<v Speaker 1>the HR department at the university that</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they were doing was completely </v>

1055
00:52:43.491 --> 00:52:44.324
<v Speaker 1>unwarranted and that they had no </v>
<v Speaker 1>business doing it whatsoever and that </v>

1056
00:52:46.671 --> 00:52:47.504
<v Speaker 1>they should stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then I released the videos and I </v>

1057
00:52:51.321 --> 00:52:55.040
<v Speaker 1>thought then I went to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1058
00:52:55.041 --> 00:52:58.700
<v Speaker 1>the reason I made the videos was because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to think these things through,</v>

1059
00:52:58.730 --> 00:53:00.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1060
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:04.130
<v Speaker 1>so like I'm doing onstage right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking things through,</v>

1061
00:53:04.131 --> 00:53:04.964
<v Speaker 1>it's like something was bothering me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was trying to lay out the </v>

1062
00:53:07.401 --> 00:53:11.390
<v Speaker 1>arguments and trying to figure out why </v>
<v Speaker 1>it bothered me into put a logical,</v>

1063
00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:11.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1064
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:15.080
<v Speaker 1>to arrange it in a logical manner and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to communicate it.</v>

1065
00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:16.640
<v Speaker 1>And you do that partly because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1066
00:53:16.641 --> 00:53:17.474
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is bugging me and here's what I </v>

1067
00:53:18.591 --> 00:53:19.424
<v Speaker 1>think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like,</v>

1068
00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:21.680
<v Speaker 1>is it bugging you too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how about you?</v>

1069
00:53:21.681 --> 00:53:23.540
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if it isn't bugging any of you,</v>

1070
00:53:23.541 --> 00:53:26.880
<v Speaker 1>well then I'm probably crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if it's bugging all of you to,</v>

1071
00:53:26.881 --> 00:53:27.691
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1072
00:53:27.691 --> 00:53:30.570
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's something here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why you have to be able to</v>

1073
00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:32.400
<v Speaker 1>speak freely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1074
00:53:32.401 --> 00:53:33.234
<v Speaker 1>Because you have to be able to bumble </v>
<v Speaker 1>around with your thought and formulate </v>

1075
00:53:35.791 --> 00:53:36.624
<v Speaker 1>things and then see how other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>respond to it and they'll criticize you </v>

1076
00:53:39.511 --> 00:53:42.270
<v Speaker 1>or maybe agree with you and you get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>modify what you're thinking.</v>

1077
00:53:42.271 --> 00:53:43.104
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and plus I was experimenting like I </v>

1078
00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:47.820
<v Speaker 1>often do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was experimenting with Youtube.</v>

1079
00:53:47.821 --> 00:53:48.271
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1080
00:53:48.271 --> 00:53:50.190
<v Speaker 1>let's see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1081
00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:53.750
<v Speaker 1>that was quite something</v>

1082
00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:54.863
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1083
00:53:59.350 --> 00:54:00.183
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that happened was there </v>

1084
00:54:00.731 --> 00:54:04.930
<v Speaker 1>was a big demonstration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an anti Peterson demonstration.</v>

1085
00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:06.273
<v Speaker 1>So I've had my own demonstration and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was in front of the building I </v>

1086
00:54:09.821 --> 00:54:12.550
<v Speaker 1>worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not too many people came,</v>

1087
00:54:12.551 --> 00:54:13.384
<v Speaker 1>but they were people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people who came were calling me the </v>

1088
00:54:15.641 --> 00:54:18.580
<v Speaker 1>sorts of names that Eric was called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the Brett was called,</v>

1089
00:54:18.850 --> 00:54:19.683
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a bigot and a transphobic and </v>

1090
00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:22.030
<v Speaker 1>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1091
00:54:22.031 --> 00:54:22.864
<v Speaker 1>I was a racist because the HR department</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the university had taken advice from </v>

1092
00:54:26.951 --> 00:54:27.784
<v Speaker 1>black lives matter in formulating these </v>
<v Speaker 1>policies and black lives matter in new </v>

1093
00:54:31.541 --> 00:54:32.374
<v Speaker 1>Toronto was led or established by two </v>
<v Speaker 1>women who I thought were reprehensible </v>

1094
00:54:37.690 --> 00:54:39.580
<v Speaker 1>and had nothing to do with their race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1095
00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:42.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't care who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be reprehensible.</v>

1096
00:54:42.550 --> 00:54:44.770
<v Speaker 1>And they were reprehensible in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>estimation.</v>

1097
00:54:44.771 --> 00:54:46.930
<v Speaker 1>And there was plenty of documented </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence for that.</v>

1098
00:54:47.230 --> 00:54:48.041
<v Speaker 1>And so I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1099
00:54:48.041 --> 00:54:51.430
<v Speaker 1>why the hell are we taking advice on our</v>
<v Speaker 1>hr policies from,</v>

1100
00:54:52.090 --> 00:54:53.530
<v Speaker 1>from these people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1101
00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:56.770
<v Speaker 1>when did that become acceptable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that,</v>

1102
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:58.570
<v Speaker 1>that's why I was a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1103
00:54:58.870 --> 00:55:00.100
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

1104
00:55:00.101 --> 00:55:00.934
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these accusations were thrown at </v>

1105
00:55:02.771 --> 00:55:05.680
<v Speaker 1>me and I thought about that a lot in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last year.</v>

1106
00:55:05.681 --> 00:55:07.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was that reasonable?</v>

1107
00:55:07.211 --> 00:55:08.044
<v Speaker 1>And it's actually kind of reasonable in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a weird way because Canada's a stable </v>

1108
00:55:12.941 --> 00:55:13.774
<v Speaker 1>country and has been for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty peaceful and things work </v>

1109
00:55:16.211 --> 00:55:17.044
<v Speaker 1>pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you pop your head up and say </v>

1110
00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:21.940
<v Speaker 1>something stupid and reprehensible is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on,</v>

1111
00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:23.190
<v Speaker 1>the Canadians say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1112
00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:25.180
<v Speaker 1>this is Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're crazy.</v>

1113
00:55:25.930 --> 00:55:28.210
<v Speaker 1>And which is the right response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1114
00:55:28.211 --> 00:55:29.044
<v Speaker 1>And so then they throw a bunch of things</v>
<v Speaker 1>at you that might match the kind of </v>

1115
00:55:32.021 --> 00:55:36.400
<v Speaker 1>crazy you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if one of them sticks then well then</v>

1116
00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:37.360
<v Speaker 1>they can ignore you.</v>

1117
00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:38.900
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1118
00:55:38.901 --> 00:55:39.734
<v Speaker 1>I'm obviously being a bit facetious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like the people who are doing </v>

1119
00:55:42.251 --> 00:55:43.084
<v Speaker 1>this to me didn't know exactly why they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were doing it and it isn't like they </v>

1120
00:55:45.221 --> 00:55:49.330
<v Speaker 1>were trying to bring me down and destroy</v>
<v Speaker 1>me because they certainly were.</v>

1121
00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:50.853
<v Speaker 1>And then 200 faculty members and </v>
<v Speaker 1>graduate students and the like from the </v>

1122
00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:56.823
<v Speaker 1>disciplines that you'd expect wrote a </v>
<v Speaker 1>petition saying that I had made the </v>

1123
00:55:59.891 --> 00:56:03.280
<v Speaker 1>university an unsafe place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1124
00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:05.013
<v Speaker 1>and then there was a counter </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstration that the students who </v>

1125
00:56:07.901 --> 00:56:08.734
<v Speaker 1>decided to support free speech set up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they asked me to speak and lauren </v>

1126
00:56:11.891 --> 00:56:14.890
<v Speaker 1>southern to speak and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of other people and they had an</v>

1127
00:56:14.891 --> 00:56:15.724
<v Speaker 1>open mic session so that anyone could </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak and it was out in front of the </v>

1128
00:56:19.061 --> 00:56:19.894
<v Speaker 1>same building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was quite a few people at </v>

1129
00:56:20.771 --> 00:56:22.720
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was about 200 people.</v>

1130
00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:23.553
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I went out there and that there was </v>

1131
00:56:25.521 --> 00:56:28.000
<v Speaker 1>some bad guys there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1132
00:56:28.001 --> 00:56:31.300
<v Speaker 1>there were just your typical students </v>
<v Speaker 1>who were confused and squawking away and</v>

1133
00:56:31.301 --> 00:56:32.134
<v Speaker 1>chanting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but peppered among them were the types </v>

1134
00:56:34.781 --> 00:56:37.360
<v Speaker 1>of people who were seriously looking for</v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>

1135
00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:39.490
<v Speaker 1>And I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a clinical psychologist,</v>

1136
00:56:39.491 --> 00:56:42.340
<v Speaker 1>I've worked with all sorts of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can identify people like that.</v>

1137
00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:45.250
<v Speaker 1>They're not very common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank God.</v>

1138
00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:48.210
<v Speaker 1>But there were plenty of them at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>rally and they,</v>

1139
00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:53.250
<v Speaker 1>it could be any kind of rally where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility for trouble was emerging and</v>

1140
00:56:53.591 --> 00:56:55.510
<v Speaker 1>they would have been the type that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be there.</v>

1141
00:56:55.511 --> 00:56:59.950
<v Speaker 1>So I was keeping my eye on them and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were blasting white noise and there were</v>

1142
00:56:59.951 --> 00:57:03.660
<v Speaker 1>unplugging our PA systems and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stealing the mic and,</v>

1143
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:04.583
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just behaving in a manner that should </v>

1144
00:57:07.271 --> 00:57:10.540
<v Speaker 1>have been shut down by the university </v>
<v Speaker 1>authorities but wasn't,</v>

1145
00:57:10.541 --> 00:57:11.374
<v Speaker 1>but the university authorities were </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken off guard by all of this and they </v>

1146
00:57:13.331 --> 00:57:14.164
<v Speaker 1>didn't really know what to do and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't really aware of the underlying </v>

1147
00:57:16.961 --> 00:57:19.960
<v Speaker 1>legal transformations that were going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our society.</v>

1148
00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:22.960
<v Speaker 1>And anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they unplugged the mic.</v>

1149
00:57:22.961 --> 00:57:23.794
<v Speaker 1>And so then I talked very loudly about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the necessity for free speech and that </v>

1150
00:57:29.411 --> 00:57:30.244
<v Speaker 1>was recorded and went online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I left and I came back about </v>

1151
00:57:34.931 --> 00:57:38.070
<v Speaker 1>two hours later to talk to the cops and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1152
00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:39.093
<v Speaker 1>to see if anything I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was hoping that nothing of any </v>

1153
00:57:42.161 --> 00:57:44.470
<v Speaker 1>significance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one was hurt.</v>

1154
00:57:44.471 --> 00:57:45.304
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to go talk to the cops and </v>
<v Speaker 1>see if it all went okay and I went and </v>

1155
00:57:48.701 --> 00:57:50.200
<v Speaker 1>talked to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when I came back,</v>

1156
00:57:50.201 --> 00:57:51.034
<v Speaker 1>this group of trans activists protestors</v>
<v Speaker 1>who claim to be speaking for the Trans </v>

1157
00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't exist,</v>

1158
00:58:00.521 --> 00:58:03.700
<v Speaker 1>there is no trans community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not a homogenous group.</v>

1159
00:58:03.701 --> 00:58:06.400
<v Speaker 1>They don't all think the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And besides,</v>

1160
00:58:06.401 --> 00:58:07.234
<v Speaker 1>you don't become the spokesman for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person by claiming that you're the </v>

1161
00:58:10.361 --> 00:58:11.194
<v Speaker 1>spokesman just because you happen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>share some of the attributes of that </v>

1162
00:58:13.751 --> 00:58:14.500
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>

1163
00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:15.333
<v Speaker 1>But we're so guilty about the treatment </v>
<v Speaker 1>of minorities that were willing to </v>

1164
00:58:18.731 --> 00:58:23.230
<v Speaker 1>regard anyone who plays that particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>card as worthy of listening to.</v>

1165
00:58:23.231 --> 00:58:25.270
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big mistake because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1166
00:58:25.271 --> 00:58:27.760
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's valid representation and invalid</v>

1167
00:58:27.761 --> 00:58:29.110
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

1168
00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:31.930
<v Speaker 1>they surrounded me and videotape the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exchange.</v>

1169
00:58:31.931 --> 00:58:32.764
<v Speaker 1>And it was one particularly noisy person</v>
<v Speaker 1>there who was quite dismissive and </v>

1170
00:58:36.371 --> 00:58:39.010
<v Speaker 1>insulting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I tried to have a conversation.</v>

1171
00:58:39.011 --> 00:58:39.870
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1172
00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:43.360
<v Speaker 1>the first thing this person said was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Peterson,</v>

1173
00:58:43.361 --> 00:58:46.150
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about the Nazis that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were at your rally?</v>

1174
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:49.840
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1175
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:53.170
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to really look hard in Canada</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find a Nazi.</v>

1176
00:58:53.171 --> 00:58:55.360
<v Speaker 1>They're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there just aren't that many of them,</v>

1177
00:58:55.361 --> 00:58:56.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1178
00:58:56.980 --> 00:58:57.813
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was preposterous to begin </v>

1179
00:58:59.891 --> 00:59:00.724
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1180
00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:02.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1181
00:59:02.201 --> 00:59:02.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1182
00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:04.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want me to say?</v>

1183
00:59:04.331 --> 00:59:05.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome Nazis.</v>

1184
00:59:05.951 --> 00:59:07.540
<v Speaker 1>It's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I said,</v>

1185
00:59:07.541 --> 00:59:09.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't like Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1186
00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:10.660
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she said,</v>

1187
00:59:10.661 --> 00:59:11.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about,</v>

1188
00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:13.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that they were here?</v>

1189
00:59:13.941 --> 00:59:15.400
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1190
00:59:15.401 --> 00:59:20.110
<v Speaker 1>I can't control who happens to appear </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>

1191
00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:21.340
<v Speaker 1>And it was all,</v>

1192
00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:24.660
<v Speaker 1>it was all false.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of that was true at all.</v>

1193
00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:27.750
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't even a little bit true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1194
00:59:27.751 --> 00:59:30.330
<v Speaker 1>it's an easy weapon to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to haul out.</v>

1195
00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:34.800
<v Speaker 1>And so they sh she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1196
00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:38.790
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not being smart about that.</v>

1197
00:59:38.791 --> 00:59:42.090
<v Speaker 1>It was like this was a trans person and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly,</v>

1198
00:59:42.330 --> 00:59:43.163
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't figure out how to refer to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll say her and I got health without </v>

1199
00:59:47.701 --> 00:59:48.534
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I tried to have a conversation and </v>

1200
00:59:51.661 --> 00:59:56.070
<v Speaker 1>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was just blaring nonstop ideological</v>

1201
00:59:56.130 --> 00:59:57.810
<v Speaker 1>like nonsense at me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1202
00:59:57.990 --> 00:59:58.823
<v Speaker 1>And just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just hurt cause I like to talk to </v>

1203
01:00:01.261 --> 01:00:01.801
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1204
01:00:01.801 --> 01:00:05.280
<v Speaker 1>But I really do not like having </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological slogans glared at me.</v>

1205
01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:07.110
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find it,</v>

1206
01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:11.590
<v Speaker 1>I find it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly how,</v>

1207
01:00:11.591 --> 01:00:12.670
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how I find it,</v>

1208
01:00:12.671 --> 01:00:15.950
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1209
01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:18.770
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like really loud white noise.</v>

1210
01:00:18.771 --> 01:00:20.550
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe it's worse than that.</v>

1211
01:00:20.551 --> 01:00:22.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like static.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like really loud,</v>

1212
01:00:22.341 --> 01:00:23.850
<v Speaker 1>static.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's jagged.</v>

1213
01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.630
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1214
01:00:26.631 --> 01:00:28.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like quit that.</v>

1215
01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:30.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to talk to you,</v>

1216
01:00:30.501 --> 01:00:34.760
<v Speaker 1>but I can't tolerate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what slogan means?</v>

1217
01:00:35.570 --> 01:00:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Slogan is derived from Tube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welsh,</v>

1218
01:00:38.451 --> 01:00:43.430
<v Speaker 1>word slew ag and Gerome and it means </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle cry of the dead.</v>

1219
01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:48.160
<v Speaker 1>So that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're thinking about man.</v>

1220
01:00:48.161 --> 01:00:51.280
<v Speaker 1>The next time you want to like have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>slogan on your tee shirts,</v>

1221
01:00:51.281 --> 01:00:52.114
<v Speaker 1>just remember who you're standing for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're the skeletal army of </v>

1222
01:00:54.821 --> 01:00:58.570
<v Speaker 1>zombies come to life and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they are possessing you,</v>

1223
01:00:58.571 --> 01:01:00.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's their words,</v>

1224
01:01:00.191 --> 01:01:01.024
<v Speaker 1>your mouth thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing alive and it's not </v>

1225
01:01:03.371 --> 01:01:05.860
<v Speaker 1>something that likes life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a horror show.</v>

1226
01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:09.070
<v Speaker 1>That's what a slogan is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

1227
01:01:09.130 --> 01:01:09.963
<v Speaker 1>they videotaped all this and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to put it online to show what a </v>

1228
01:01:12.251 --> 01:01:15.220
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible creature I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they did.</v>

1229
01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:16.113
<v Speaker 1>And that didn't work out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things being viewed about three and a </v>

1230
01:01:19.031 --> 01:01:19.864
<v Speaker 1>half million times now and the positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>comments out number of the negative </v>

1231
01:01:23.801 --> 01:01:26.560
<v Speaker 1>comments like 99 to one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1232
01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:31.270
<v Speaker 1>And so that was an interesting case of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that inversion that Jonathan was talking</v>

1233
01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:31.691
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1234
01:01:31.691 --> 01:01:36.460
<v Speaker 1>how everything's upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they tried one tactic and it just</v>

1235
01:01:36.461 --> 01:01:37.840
<v Speaker 1>flipped on them completely.</v>

1236
01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:39.590
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1237
01:01:39.610 --> 01:01:40.660
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's,</v>

1238
01:01:40.661 --> 01:01:41.494
<v Speaker 1>here's something to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if one person who was nominally </v>

1239
01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:50.460
<v Speaker 1>supporting me at that rally would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>done anything stupid whatsoever that was</v>

1240
01:01:51.101 --> 01:01:54.190
<v Speaker 1>captured on videotape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have been sunk.</v>

1241
01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:57.280
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're in this situation where the</v>

1242
01:01:57.281 --> 01:02:02.281
<v Speaker 1>actions of specific individuals have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>determining effect far beyond what we're</v>

1243
01:02:02.891 --> 01:02:03.724
<v Speaker 1>accustomed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You saw that in Charlottesville where </v>

1244
01:02:04.901 --> 01:02:05.734
<v Speaker 1>that guy ran somebody over with a car </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was like political polarization </v>

1245
01:02:09.041 --> 01:02:12.400
<v Speaker 1>in the u s increased instantly by 10% </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1246
01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:13.263
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said like social media isn't an echo </v>

1247
01:02:15.791 --> 01:02:17.650
<v Speaker 1>chamber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an amplifier.</v>

1248
01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:20.340
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1249
01:02:20.341 --> 01:02:21.174
<v Speaker 1>so I was very fortunate and then this </v>
<v Speaker 1>person also said that she had watched </v>

1250
01:02:24.871 --> 01:02:25.704
<v Speaker 1>all my youtube videos and I looked at </v>
<v Speaker 1>her because that was ridiculous because </v>

1251
01:02:29.851 --> 01:02:32.050
<v Speaker 1>there was like 200 of them online by </v>
<v Speaker 1>that point.</v>

1252
01:02:32.051 --> 01:02:32.884
<v Speaker 1>And like</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people I presume have now watched </v>

1253
01:02:36.601 --> 01:02:40.200
<v Speaker 1>all 200 of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like 500 hours of content.</v>

1254
01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:45.200
<v Speaker 1>So I knew that that was complete rubbish</v>
<v Speaker 1>and basically said as much.</v>

1255
01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:50.580
<v Speaker 1>And anyways it went well for me and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't go so well for the protesters and</v>

1256
01:02:50.581 --> 01:02:51.414
<v Speaker 1>then the university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that was my first encounter with </v>

1257
01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:55.133
<v Speaker 1>Youtube and its tendency to amplify and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also what the tight rope line is </v>

1258
01:03:02.341 --> 01:03:04.570
<v Speaker 1>when these sorts of things happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1259
01:03:04.571 --> 01:03:07.110
<v Speaker 1>and for a whole year it's not quite so </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad now,</v>

1260
01:03:07.111 --> 01:03:07.944
<v Speaker 1>although it's just about as bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived in absolute terror of ever have </v>

1261
01:03:11.221 --> 01:03:15.720
<v Speaker 1>two things ever saying the wrong thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it was clipped out of context,</v>

1262
01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:16.933
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or having something unearth that I said </v>

1263
01:03:19.381 --> 01:03:21.810
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the wrong thing,</v>

1264
01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:24.300
<v Speaker 1>even if it was taken out of context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now luckily,</v>

1265
01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:28.290
<v Speaker 1>and this was kind of unique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I already had 260 videos,</v>

1266
01:03:28.291 --> 01:03:29.124
<v Speaker 1>200 videos up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when I was being accused of all </v>

1267
01:03:31.561 --> 01:03:33.660
<v Speaker 1>of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could say,</v>

1268
01:03:33.661 --> 01:03:34.494
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have add or there's 500 every single </v>

1269
01:03:37.321 --> 01:03:40.170
<v Speaker 1>word I've said to students in the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years is being recorded.</v>

1270
01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:43.620
<v Speaker 1>If you want to find some Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 1>propaganda,</v>

1271
01:03:43.621 --> 01:03:44.910
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have adder man.</v>

1272
01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:48.180
<v Speaker 1>Good luck to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course it was not only false,</v>

1273
01:03:48.181 --> 01:03:50.850
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was antithetical to the truth because</v>

1274
01:03:50.851 --> 01:03:51.684
<v Speaker 1>I've been teaching people about Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 1>atrocities for 30 years and trying to </v>

1275
01:03:56.791 --> 01:04:01.791
<v Speaker 1>help people understand how it was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be likely had they been in Nazi</v>

1276
01:04:02.101 --> 01:04:02.934
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they would've been on the side of </v>

1277
01:04:03.781 --> 01:04:05.760
<v Speaker 1>the Nazis and not on the side of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jews.</v>

1278
01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:06.613
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't have been the hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have been the perpetrator </v>

1279
01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:09.473
<v Speaker 1>statistically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that you really need to understand </v>

1280
01:04:11.671 --> 01:04:13.620
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was fortunate,</v>

1281
01:04:13.621 --> 01:04:16.320
<v Speaker 1>I was protected by that backlog of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

1282
01:04:16.321 --> 01:04:19.830
<v Speaker 1>And so that was really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the university did it.</v>

1283
01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:21.930
<v Speaker 1>Another thing that reversed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1284
01:04:21.931 --> 01:04:24.360
<v Speaker 1>they wrote me a letter saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1285
01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:25.194
<v Speaker 1>all these people are complaining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making the campus and unsafe </v>

1286
01:04:28.171 --> 01:04:29.004
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to and your might be violating </v>

1287
01:04:31.711 --> 01:04:33.960
<v Speaker 1>our code of conduct and the law.</v>

1288
01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:35.003
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what to make of that </v>

1289
01:04:36.151 --> 01:04:36.984
<v Speaker 1>letter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told them to take the letter back </v>

1290
01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:40.740
<v Speaker 1>because I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1291
01:04:40.741 --> 01:04:41.574
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to go after me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I actually liked the University </v>

1292
01:04:43.590 --> 01:04:44.730
<v Speaker 1>of Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're gonna go after me,</v>

1293
01:04:44.731 --> 01:04:47.610
<v Speaker 1>you should go after me correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>

1294
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:52.670
<v Speaker 1>this document is actually untrue in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it contains sins of omission because you</v>

1295
01:04:52.741 --> 01:04:53.574
<v Speaker 1>may have got letters from the staff </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying what a reprehensible person I </v>

1296
01:04:56.581 --> 01:04:57.414
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you also got 15,000 signatures on a </v>

1297
01:05:00.331 --> 01:05:03.360
<v Speaker 1>petition and hundreds of letters from </v>
<v Speaker 1>people supporting me.</v>

1298
01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:05.250
<v Speaker 1>And you didn't say anything about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the letter.</v>

1299
01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:07.710
<v Speaker 1>So how about we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1300
01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:08.633
<v Speaker 1>you write a letter that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well some people aren't very happy with </v>

1301
01:05:10.891 --> 01:05:13.890
<v Speaker 1>you and other people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we've decided that what you're doing</v>

1302
01:05:13.891 --> 01:05:16.050
<v Speaker 1>is too risky and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should stop,</v>

1303
01:05:16.051 --> 01:05:16.884
<v Speaker 1>but they wouldn't take it.</v>

1304
01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:22.560
<v Speaker 1>So I read it online and that's what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting too because now if something</v>

1305
01:05:23.171 --> 01:05:25.840
<v Speaker 1>happens to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have to be secret.</v>

1306
01:05:26.350 --> 01:05:30.040
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even comment on it except maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>with raised eyebrows from time to time,</v>

1307
01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:33.550
<v Speaker 1>I just read it and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you draw your own damn conclusions here.</v>

1308
01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:35.230
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was actually,</v>

1309
01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:38.380
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say secretly happy about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I wasn't,</v>

1310
01:05:38.381 --> 01:05:41.530
<v Speaker 1>because my job was at risk and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't all that was at risk.</v>

1311
01:05:41.531 --> 01:05:42.364
<v Speaker 1>But my job certainly was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had said when I made the video </v>

1312
01:05:46.661 --> 01:05:51.661
<v Speaker 1>criticizing bill c 16 that the act of </v>
<v Speaker 1>making the video was probably illegal.</v>

1313
01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:54.130
<v Speaker 1>And then the university came out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1314
01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:58.570
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is probably illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so my claims,</v>

1315
01:05:58.571 --> 01:06:01.630
<v Speaker 1>which the press,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the press was very divided about this.</v>

1316
01:06:01.631 --> 01:06:03.700
<v Speaker 1>And they thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe I was being too radical in my</v>

1317
01:06:03.701 --> 01:06:04.090
<v Speaker 1>claims.</v>

1318
01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:05.500
<v Speaker 1>But then the university came out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1319
01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:06.723
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably violating the law and </v>

1320
01:06:07.601 --> 01:06:08.920
<v Speaker 1>you should shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

1321
01:06:08.921 --> 01:06:09.754
<v Speaker 1>Ha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you that that's how this law was </v>

1322
01:06:11.951 --> 01:06:13.840
<v Speaker 1>constructed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1323
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:17.290
<v Speaker 1>and then they did it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1324
01:06:17.291 --> 01:06:21.040
<v Speaker 1>and I know how HR departments works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like one letters like shut the hell</v>

1325
01:06:21.041 --> 01:06:21.874
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second letter is we told you once </v>

1326
01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:25.540
<v Speaker 1>already to shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Third Letter says,</v>

1327
01:06:25.541 --> 01:06:28.900
<v Speaker 1>we told you twice you didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like now you're in trouble.</v>

1328
01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.810
<v Speaker 1>And then the fourth letter is see you </v>
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

1329
01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:35.680
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a tenured faculty member </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you break the law,</v>

1330
01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:39.100
<v Speaker 1>that's sufficient to be be nodded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tenured faculty members.</v>

1331
01:06:39.101 --> 01:06:43.750
<v Speaker 1>So they were gearing up to do this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then,</v>

1332
01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:47.410
<v Speaker 1>well to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well man,</v>

1333
01:06:47.411 --> 01:06:48.244
<v Speaker 1>that was really something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then what happened was there were </v>

1334
01:06:49.781 --> 01:06:54.781
<v Speaker 1>reporters at our house for for like four</v>
<v Speaker 1>months lined up just all the time,</v>

1335
01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:58.180
<v Speaker 1>literally eight hours a day.</v>

1336
01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:00.280
<v Speaker 1>The reporters coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reporters going out,</v>

1337
01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:01.383
<v Speaker 1>there's about 250 newspaper articles </v>
<v Speaker 1>published in Canada about this over </v>

1338
01:07:04.481 --> 01:07:05.314
<v Speaker 1>about a two and a half month period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that didn't count the podcasts and </v>

1339
01:07:07.931 --> 01:07:10.720
<v Speaker 1>the radio shows and the TV coverage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like it just,</v>

1340
01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:14.800
<v Speaker 1>it went absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was absolutely insane.</v>

1341
01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:19.090
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anything like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And See,</v>

1342
01:07:19.091 --> 01:07:19.924
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to figure out what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on at that point because my sense </v>

1343
01:07:22.271 --> 01:07:25.300
<v Speaker 1>when I made the videos was this had </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do with transgender rights.</v>

1344
01:07:25.301 --> 01:07:26.134
<v Speaker 1>This is indicative of a deep war of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas and this is just the latest </v>

1345
01:07:29.921 --> 01:07:34.150
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of that deep war of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe it was a war at a philosophical</v>

1346
01:07:34.151 --> 01:07:36.640
<v Speaker 1>level or even a war at a theological </v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

1347
01:07:36.641 --> 01:07:38.880
<v Speaker 1>which I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually think it's such a deep,</v>

1348
01:07:38.881 --> 01:07:40.900
<v Speaker 1>or that it is a ward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a theological level.</v>

1349
01:07:41.370 --> 01:07:42.203
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was sort of the level at which </v>

1350
01:07:43.481 --> 01:07:44.620
<v Speaker 1>I was going after it.</v>

1351
01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:45.933
<v Speaker 1>And I believe that subsequent events </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrated that that was the case </v>

1352
01:07:50.201 --> 01:07:53.760
<v Speaker 1>because what should have happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always think of counterfactuals,</v>

1353
01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:56.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a client comes into my office and the</v>

1354
01:07:56.231 --> 01:08:00.340
<v Speaker 1>first time I see them and they're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>upset because they couldn't find a place</v>

1355
01:08:00.341 --> 01:08:03.160
<v Speaker 1>to park in there late and they're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>apologetic and I think,</v>

1356
01:08:03.161 --> 01:08:03.994
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well now I know something about you </v>

1357
01:08:04.781 --> 01:08:06.370
<v Speaker 1>because you could have come in here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1358
01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:09.280
<v Speaker 1>why the hell didn't you tell me where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the parking was?</v>

1359
01:08:09.281 --> 01:08:10.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>

1360
01:08:10.330 --> 01:08:12.190
<v Speaker 1>or you could've said thought to </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

1361
01:08:12.191 --> 01:08:13.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my time anyway,</v>

1362
01:08:13.341 --> 01:08:14.174
<v Speaker 1>so I don't have to apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you run these counterfactuals that </v>

1363
01:08:17.001 --> 01:08:19.700
<v Speaker 1>helps you understand the world better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

1364
01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:22.273
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should have happened was that I </v>

1365
01:08:24.411 --> 01:08:27.710
<v Speaker 1>made these videos two in the morning to </v>
<v Speaker 1>15 minutes long.</v>

1366
01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:31.400
<v Speaker 1>There's a little flurry of interest and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's like onto the next thing.</v>

1367
01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:35.150
<v Speaker 1>But that is not what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That didn't happen even a little bit.</v>

1368
01:08:35.210 --> 01:08:36.043
<v Speaker 1>What happened was so opposite from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I still don't know what to make of </v>

1369
01:08:39.711 --> 01:08:41.240
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course this is part of it,</v>

1370
01:08:41.241 --> 01:08:43.930
<v Speaker 1>the fact that I'm here talking to all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you people and,</v>

1371
01:08:46.530 --> 01:08:47.363
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then what happened was that the </v>

1372
01:08:50.631 --> 01:08:55.631
<v Speaker 1>press flipped and came on my side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 200 Canadian newspapers,</v>

1373
01:08:56.210 --> 01:08:58.220
<v Speaker 1>there's a consortium came out and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1374
01:08:58.221 --> 01:08:59.054
<v Speaker 1>we support Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then a huge number of mainstream </v>

1375
01:09:01.461 --> 01:09:05.090
<v Speaker 1>journalists like the powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>independent mainstream journalists,</v>

1376
01:09:05.091 --> 01:09:06.710
<v Speaker 1>Barbara K,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1377
01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:08.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Antonella,</v>

1378
01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:10.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's Nellis last name?</v>

1379
01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:13.400
<v Speaker 1>Can you ever remember names?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So embarrassing.</v>

1380
01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:16.160
<v Speaker 1>Margaret [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conrad Black,</v>

1381
01:09:16.570 --> 01:09:18.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at crazy new fee.</v>

1382
01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:20.810
<v Speaker 1>He goes on CBC at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1383
01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:23.210
<v Speaker 1>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rex Murphy.</v>

1384
01:09:23.211 --> 01:09:24.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all came out on,</v>

1385
01:09:24.381 --> 01:09:25.214
<v Speaker 1>on my side because what they did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did the journalistic homework and </v>

1386
01:09:28.551 --> 01:09:32.120
<v Speaker 1>they went and read the things I read and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found out that if anything,</v>

1387
01:09:32.121 --> 01:09:32.954
<v Speaker 1>I was understating the catastrophe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was written into the Ontario Human </v>

1388
01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:39.530
<v Speaker 1>Rights Commission website.</v>

1389
01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:40.363
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the catastrophes was they wrote </v>

1390
01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:43.333
<v Speaker 1>in a social constructionist view of </v>
<v Speaker 1>gender identity that's law in Canada </v>

1391
01:09:47.931 --> 01:09:49.270
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

1392
01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:51.770
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to say exactly how significant</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is.</v>

1393
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:57.070
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it means is maybe is that to have a</v>

1394
01:09:57.891 --> 01:09:58.724
<v Speaker 1>view that biology is the primary </v>
<v Speaker 1>determinant of gender identity is now </v>

1395
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:05.000
<v Speaker 1>illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1396
01:10:05.001 --> 01:10:06.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can say,</v>

1397
01:10:06.681 --> 01:10:07.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's alarmist,</v>

1398
01:10:07.881 --> 01:10:12.020
<v Speaker 1>but hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know how ideas unfold across time.</v>

1399
01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:13.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have an idea,</v>

1400
01:10:13.521 --> 01:10:16.730
<v Speaker 1>you put it in the law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the law is a living thing.</v>

1401
01:10:16.731 --> 01:10:19.430
<v Speaker 1>It's got lots of tentacles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows how it unfolds.</v>

1402
01:10:19.431 --> 01:10:20.264
<v Speaker 1>You throw something new in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't even know what it is you're </v>

1403
01:10:22.041 --> 01:10:22.874
<v Speaker 1>throwing in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You throw a demand that a social </v>

1404
01:10:24.651 --> 01:10:28.370
<v Speaker 1>constructionist view of gender identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>is now legally true.</v>

1405
01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:28.821
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1406
01:10:28.821 --> 01:10:30.920
<v Speaker 1>what do you do with all the evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 1>biologists like,</v>

1407
01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:34.430
<v Speaker 1>like Brett who say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1408
01:10:35.450 --> 01:10:36.530
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>

1409
01:10:36.650 --> 01:10:40.010
<v Speaker 1>It's partly socially constructed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everything is among human beings.</v>

1410
01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:41.690
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the journalist went and wrote,</v>

1411
01:10:41.691 --> 01:10:44.300
<v Speaker 1>read that and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they thought,</v>

1412
01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:45.380
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this guy,</v>

1413
01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:47.263
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't any of those things that he's </v>

1414
01:10:48.561 --> 01:10:49.394
<v Speaker 1>being accused of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the funniest days of my life was </v>

1415
01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:53.670
<v Speaker 1>I went to this lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1416
01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:58.580
<v Speaker 1>where I was being accused of being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>racist and a transphobic and a bigot and</v>

1417
01:10:58.581 --> 01:11:02.180
<v Speaker 1>all of these things in the same day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally the same day,</v>

1418
01:11:02.330 --> 01:11:03.163
<v Speaker 1>there were 30 people in my house on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>third floor and about 15 of the more </v>

1419
01:11:06.921 --> 01:11:07.754
<v Speaker 1>from this native tribe Kwakwaka'Wakw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they live on northern tip of northern </v>

1420
01:11:12.261 --> 01:11:14.310
<v Speaker 1>Vancouver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just stablish to relationship with</v>

1421
01:11:14.311 --> 01:11:15.144
<v Speaker 1>a carver there named Charles Joseph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who recently had a huge totem pole </v>

1422
01:11:17.850 --> 01:11:20.010
<v Speaker 1>erected in front of the Montreal Museum </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Fine Art.</v>

1423
01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:22.320
<v Speaker 1>I established a working relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>with him.</v>

1424
01:11:22.321 --> 01:11:23.154
<v Speaker 1>He was at a residential school survivor </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'd been buying a bunch of his art </v>

1425
01:11:26.281 --> 01:11:31.230
<v Speaker 1>and I built a replica of modern replica </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a Kwakwaka'Wakw big house on my third</v>

1426
01:11:31.231 --> 01:11:34.080
<v Speaker 1>floor with his help and filled it with </v>
<v Speaker 1>totem poles and all these things.</v>

1427
01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:34.913
<v Speaker 1>And he brought a bunch of his people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Toronto and had induction ceremony </v>

1428
01:11:38.731 --> 01:11:41.940
<v Speaker 1>and I was inducted into their tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was the same day.</v>

1429
01:11:41.941 --> 01:11:45.030
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you make of that?</v>

1430
01:11:45.090 --> 01:11:45.960
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such,</v>

1431
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:47.700
<v Speaker 1>it's so surreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1432
01:11:47.701 --> 01:11:49.800
<v Speaker 1>to go from one of those worlds to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

1433
01:11:50.050 --> 01:11:53.880
<v Speaker 1>And I had many surreal days like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

1434
01:11:56.370 --> 01:11:58.260
<v Speaker 1>then I had this debate at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university,</v>

1435
01:11:58.261 --> 01:12:00.510
<v Speaker 1>which the university graciously decided </v>
<v Speaker 1>to host.</v>

1436
01:12:00.511 --> 01:12:01.344
<v Speaker 1>And I talked a lot to the dean and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of came to some terms and they </v>

1437
01:12:04.411 --> 01:12:07.560
<v Speaker 1>basically decided that they would leave </v>
<v Speaker 1>me alone.</v>

1438
01:12:08.190 --> 01:12:11.820
<v Speaker 1>And I had a terrible catastrophe of </v>
<v Speaker 1>health in December.</v>

1439
01:12:11.821 --> 01:12:14.040
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was absolutely unbearable.</v>

1440
01:12:14.041 --> 01:12:17.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't exactly know what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I could barely get it.</v>

1441
01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:19.320
<v Speaker 1>Get going to teach in January.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1442
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:22.050
<v Speaker 1>It was very shaky for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for like two months.</v>

1443
01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:24.380
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

1444
01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:28.140
<v Speaker 1>it went forward and the students were </v>
<v Speaker 1>very welcoming and inviting,</v>

1445
01:12:28.141 --> 01:12:29.040
<v Speaker 1>so that was very good.</v>

1446
01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:33.030
<v Speaker 1>But then all of this crazy background </v>
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>

1447
01:12:33.450 --> 01:12:36.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explosion didn't quit at all.</v>

1448
01:12:36.391 --> 01:12:39.300
<v Speaker 1>It just kept snowballing and snowballing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and snowballing and,</v>

1449
01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:41.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I was talking to people,</v>

1450
01:12:41.281 --> 01:12:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Gad Saad was one of the early people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>interviewed me,</v>

1451
01:12:43.981 --> 01:12:45.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to be speaking with him at</v>

1452
01:12:45.991 --> 01:12:46.824
<v Speaker 1>noon on November 11th in Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm actually quite afraid of that </v>

1453
01:12:49.291 --> 01:12:52.680
<v Speaker 1>because I think the radicals who shut us</v>
<v Speaker 1>down at Ryerson,</v>

1454
01:12:52.681 --> 01:12:53.514
<v Speaker 1>I know full well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're planning to come out in full </v>

1455
01:12:55.471 --> 01:12:56.700
<v Speaker 1>number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I really don't.</v>

1456
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:57.863
<v Speaker 1>I'm really concerned about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you know anybody who's going and </v>

1457
01:13:00.721 --> 01:13:04.260
<v Speaker 1>who's purportedly supporters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say of what we're doing,</v>

1458
01:13:04.590 --> 01:13:08.730
<v Speaker 1>I really would like you to encourage </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to like keep the,</v>

1459
01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:12.450
<v Speaker 1>keep themselves in control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1460
01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:14.153
<v Speaker 1>I know there might be agent provocateurs</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the crowd because these people are </v>

1461
01:13:16.831 --> 01:13:18.030
<v Speaker 1>certainly capable of that.</v>

1462
01:13:18.030 --> 01:13:21.420
<v Speaker 1>But I don't want anything stupid to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen now.</v>

1463
01:13:21.421 --> 01:13:22.254
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to cancel it because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're not canceling it and </v>

1464
01:13:24.871 --> 01:13:25.704
<v Speaker 1>that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't want anything stupid to </v>

1465
01:13:28.111 --> 01:13:30.000
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be better if it didn't.</v>

1466
01:13:30.090 --> 01:13:31.830
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1467
01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:33.300
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to Gad,</v>

1468
01:13:33.301 --> 01:13:34.134
<v Speaker 1>Saad and then a whole bunch of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtubers and then I got to be aware of </v>

1469
01:13:37.471 --> 01:13:40.710
<v Speaker 1>this whole Youtube universe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1470
01:13:40.711 --> 01:13:41.470
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1471
01:13:41.470 --> 01:13:43.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan was talking about.</v>

1472
01:13:43.291 --> 01:13:44.124
<v Speaker 1>And that's been an unbelievably bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience because it is the case that </v>

1473
01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:50.580
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing really uniting us in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense.</v>

1474
01:13:50.581 --> 01:13:51.840
<v Speaker 1>We're very different people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1475
01:13:51.841 --> 01:13:54.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm very different than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than Joe Rogan,</v>

1476
01:13:54.211 --> 01:13:55.044
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was on this show called h three h </v>

1477
01:13:57.660 --> 01:13:58.493
<v Speaker 1>three the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's this crazy Israeli clown </v>

1478
01:14:00.751 --> 01:14:01.740
<v Speaker 1>comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1479
01:14:01.741 --> 01:14:02.640
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1480
01:14:02.641 --> 01:14:03.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1481
01:14:03.670 --> 01:14:07.050
<v Speaker 1>Dave Rubin's and married gay guy and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1482
01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:11.560
<v Speaker 1>and while in Gad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saad is a Lebanese refugee,</v>

1483
01:14:11.561 --> 01:14:13.480
<v Speaker 1>basically it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing about us.</v>

1484
01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:18.520
<v Speaker 1>It's the same except something is </v>
<v Speaker 1>uniting us and we all kind of know about</v>

1485
01:14:18.521 --> 01:14:20.410
<v Speaker 1>each other down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all communicating and,</v>

1486
01:14:20.890 --> 01:14:23.230
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know what that means </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1487
01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:26.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that means.</v>

1488
01:14:27.490 --> 01:14:31.690
<v Speaker 1>And then at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's all been extremely strange,</v>

1489
01:14:31.691 --> 01:14:36.670
<v Speaker 1>this multiplication of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of voice that the Internet provides,</v>

1490
01:14:36.671 --> 01:14:38.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for better or for worse.</v>

1491
01:14:38.021 --> 01:14:39.430
<v Speaker 1>And I think that is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

1492
01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:40.293
<v Speaker 1>it's a moral amplifier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I also think that these AI systems </v>

1493
01:14:44.411 --> 01:14:47.210
<v Speaker 1>that we're building,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our moral amplifiers and,</v>

1494
01:14:47.211 --> 01:14:48.044
<v Speaker 1>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be moral amplifiers to </v>

1495
01:14:49.961 --> 01:14:50.794
<v Speaker 1>a degree that we can't even imagine even</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing how much facebook and twitter </v>

1496
01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:57.070
<v Speaker 1>and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our moral amplifiers.</v>

1497
01:14:57.071 --> 01:15:00.250
<v Speaker 1>So we bloody well better be careful </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're building super intelligent</v>

1498
01:15:00.251 --> 01:15:03.100
<v Speaker 1>machines and they're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterned on us.</v>

1499
01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:09.130
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we have to watch our step.</v>

1500
01:15:10.150 --> 01:15:12.070
<v Speaker 1>And that's basically what I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling people,</v>

1501
01:15:12.071 --> 01:15:12.904
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've been trying not to be </v>

1502
01:15:15.401 --> 01:15:16.234
<v Speaker 1>political about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some sense I think it's a </v>

1503
01:15:17.831 --> 01:15:22.831
<v Speaker 1>degeneration because I'm more </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophically minded and it's it.</v>

1504
01:15:23.470 --> 01:15:25.540
<v Speaker 1>When when things become political around</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

1505
01:15:25.570 --> 01:15:27.520
<v Speaker 1>it's like I'm at the wrong level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>

1506
01:15:27.521 --> 01:15:32.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm not facing things properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I've also found that,</v>

1507
01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:35.860
<v Speaker 1>and this has been a strange thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

1508
01:15:35.861 --> 01:15:36.694
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking to people about </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and truth and and </v>

1509
01:15:39.930 --> 01:15:43.750
<v Speaker 1>religious topics as well now for really </v>
<v Speaker 1>intensely for the last year,</v>

1510
01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:46.480
<v Speaker 1>really for my whole career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really intensely for the last year.</v>

1511
01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:47.613
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is another way the world is </v>

1512
01:15:49.601 --> 01:15:50.434
<v Speaker 1>upside down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that after being fed a nonstop diet </v>

1513
01:15:53.801 --> 01:15:54.634
<v Speaker 1>of freedom and rights for 60 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are starving to death for a diet </v>

1514
01:16:00.131 --> 01:16:00.964
<v Speaker 1>of constraint and responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who the hell would've ever thought </v>

1515
01:16:03.971 --> 01:16:04.840
<v Speaker 1>that was salable?</v>

1516
01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:05.673
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have people coming up to me all the </v>

1517
01:16:06.461 --> 01:16:07.294
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lots of it already happened many times </v>

1518
01:16:08.231 --> 01:16:08.861
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>

1519
01:16:08.861 --> 01:16:10.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1520
01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:11.193
<v Speaker 1>you've talked about responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been listening to your youtube </v>

1521
01:16:12.941 --> 01:16:14.620
<v Speaker 1>videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really straighten out in my life.</v>

1522
01:16:14.621 --> 01:16:16.660
<v Speaker 1>I now have a purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not nihilistic.</v>

1523
01:16:16.661 --> 01:16:20.680
<v Speaker 1>And when I talk to people about </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and rights,</v>

1524
01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:24.640
<v Speaker 1>especially young men in my audiences are</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly young men.</v>

1525
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:26.680
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can hear a pin drop.</v>

1526
01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:27.941
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1527
01:16:27.941 --> 01:16:29.860
<v Speaker 1>what's going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so weird.</v>

1528
01:16:29.861 --> 01:16:33.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this crazy inversion.</v>

1529
01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:34.293
<v Speaker 1>It's the least salable thing possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>has become the thing that's most in </v>

1530
01:16:38.501 --> 01:16:39.790
<v Speaker 1>demand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say like,</v>

1531
01:16:39.850 --> 01:16:42.280
<v Speaker 1>have a hard life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do something difficult.</v>

1532
01:16:42.281 --> 01:16:44.320
<v Speaker 1>Get Yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get your act together quick,</v>

1533
01:16:44.321 --> 01:16:46.840
<v Speaker 1>blaming other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assume that you're the problem.</v>

1534
01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Start small with like non heroic </v>
<v Speaker 1>activities.</v>

1535
01:16:50.530 --> 01:16:52.690
<v Speaker 1>Don't broadcast it in public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1536
01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:53.673
<v Speaker 1>Pick up something heavy and assume that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're contributing in some important </v>

1537
01:16:57.491 --> 01:17:01.240
<v Speaker 1>manner to the destiny of the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like late your soul quake.</v>

1538
01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:03.670
<v Speaker 1>When you understand what that means and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's thinking,</v>

1539
01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:05.140
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what I want to hear.</v>

1540
01:17:05.141 --> 01:17:05.974
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the hell [inaudible] and then </v>

1541
01:17:17.001 --> 01:17:19.070
<v Speaker 1>there's these biblical lectures on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

1542
01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:21.380
<v Speaker 1>I thought this is another upside down </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1543
01:17:21.381 --> 01:17:22.214
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1544
01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:24.950
<v Speaker 1>as I put business plans together before </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1545
01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:28.160
<v Speaker 1>I know how you evaluate a business plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the business plan.</v>

1546
01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:29.413
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to lay out $60,000 to rent a </v>
<v Speaker 1>theater for 12 weeks and I'm going to </v>

1547
01:17:34.101 --> 01:17:34.934
<v Speaker 1>deliver a series of lectures on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bible and that's a profit generating </v>

1548
01:17:39.441 --> 01:17:42.470
<v Speaker 1>enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to invest?</v>

1549
01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:44.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1550
01:17:44.121 --> 01:17:48.680
<v Speaker 1>get this guy needs antipsychotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>medication and he needs it quickly.</v>

1551
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:52.280
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I thought,</v>

1552
01:17:52.281 --> 01:17:53.114
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this because I want to walk </v>

1553
01:17:53.961 --> 01:17:54.794
<v Speaker 1>through these stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I want to walk through </v>

1554
01:17:56.781 --> 01:17:59.120
<v Speaker 1>these stories is because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>foundational stories.</v>

1555
01:17:59.120 --> 01:17:59.953
<v Speaker 1>I understand that there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are foundational stories for </v>

1556
01:18:02.721 --> 01:18:03.554
<v Speaker 1>better or for worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we can't get rid of them without </v>

1557
01:18:06.261 --> 01:18:09.680
<v Speaker 1>getting rid of the foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a bad idea.</v>

1558
01:18:10.010 --> 01:18:13.730
<v Speaker 1>So at least we better understand them </v>
<v Speaker 1>before we dispense with them,</v>

1559
01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:15.410
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that goes for me too.</v>

1560
01:18:15.411 --> 01:18:18.770
<v Speaker 1>And so I started doing that and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculously popular.</v>

1561
01:18:18.771 --> 01:18:23.330
<v Speaker 1>Like they always sell out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The audience is dead silent when and,</v>

1562
01:18:23.331 --> 01:18:26.150
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the atmosphere of the room is really,</v>

1563
01:18:26.151 --> 01:18:30.080
<v Speaker 1>really positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not In that Namby Pamby you know,</v>

1564
01:18:30.081 --> 01:18:31.670
<v Speaker 1>wretched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>harmless way,</v>

1565
01:18:31.671 --> 01:18:36.050
<v Speaker 1>but in the sort of charged energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for a good thing to do way.</v>

1566
01:18:36.051 --> 01:18:38.270
<v Speaker 1>And the questions are really intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

1567
01:18:38.570 --> 01:18:39.800
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and deep too.</v>

1568
01:18:39.801 --> 01:18:41.390
<v Speaker 1>And so that's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1569
01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:42.253
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I released them on the net and the most </v>

1570
01:18:43.731 --> 01:18:47.870
<v Speaker 1>popular video I have ever made is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduction to the idea of God,</v>

1571
01:18:47.871 --> 01:18:52.340
<v Speaker 1>which is the intro to this biblical </v>
<v Speaker 1>series and it's got like 850,000 views.</v>

1572
01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:53.720
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I get all these,</v>

1573
01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:54.733
<v Speaker 1>like Jonathan said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got all these atheists supporting </v>

1574
01:18:56.631 --> 01:18:58.280
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a bloody orthodox icon.</v>

1575
01:18:58.281 --> 01:19:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Carvers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the hell's up with that?</v>

1576
01:19:00.830 --> 01:19:05.740
<v Speaker 1>And like a tremendous number of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are writing me and commenting</v>

1577
01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:07.820
<v Speaker 1>on youtube are also atheists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're saying,</v>

1578
01:19:07.821 --> 01:19:08.600
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1579
01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:10.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm an atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>committed atheist and,</v>

1580
01:19:10.610 --> 01:19:13.940
<v Speaker 1>but I've been really interested in what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been saying about these religious</v>

1581
01:19:13.941 --> 01:19:14.774
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's another indication of the </v>

1582
01:19:16.611 --> 01:19:19.580
<v Speaker 1>fact that everything's upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1583
01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:23.660
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to keep making those </v>
<v Speaker 1>biblical videos because I've been trying</v>

1584
01:19:23.661 --> 01:19:24.494
<v Speaker 1>to sort through my priorities and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know what my priorities are </v>

1585
01:19:26.481 --> 01:19:30.650
<v Speaker 1>because my life has completely surreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

1586
01:19:30.651 --> 01:19:32.000
<v Speaker 1>it's like I'm in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1587
01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:34.520
<v Speaker 1>it's like I stepped into a parallel </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>

1588
01:19:34.521 --> 01:19:38.630
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I've been trying to figure out,</v>

1589
01:19:38.631 --> 01:19:39.660
<v Speaker 1>well what should I be doing?</v>

1590
01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:40.493
<v Speaker 1>And one thing I do know is that I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been going to continue with those </v>

1591
01:19:42.651 --> 01:19:45.860
<v Speaker 1>biblical lectures because I think they </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be the most significant thing that</v>

1592
01:19:45.861 --> 01:19:47.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1593
01:19:48.050 --> 01:19:49.790
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll just close and say,</v>

1594
01:19:49.791 --> 01:19:51.290
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1595
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:54.530
<v Speaker 1>with my colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've also been working on these programs</v>

1596
01:19:54.531 --> 01:19:56.150
<v Speaker 1>that help people get their lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

1597
01:19:56.151 --> 01:19:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Like the self authoring suite for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

1598
01:19:57.951 --> 01:20:00.110
<v Speaker 1>which some of you might be familiar </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

1599
01:20:00.111 --> 01:20:00.944
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's been a </v>

1600
01:20:02.121 --> 01:20:05.930
<v Speaker 1>consequence and we've done research on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the future authoring program,</v>

1601
01:20:05.931 --> 01:20:07.710
<v Speaker 1>really helps people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1602
01:20:07.711 --> 01:20:10.530
<v Speaker 1>if you give it to university students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the ones that don't know what</v>

1603
01:20:10.531 --> 01:20:11.364
<v Speaker 1>they're doing and are kind of alienated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're way more likely to stay in </v>

1604
01:20:13.801 --> 01:20:15.930
<v Speaker 1>university and they get much better </v>
<v Speaker 1>grades.</v>

1605
01:20:16.050 --> 01:20:19.060
<v Speaker 1>So that's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>

1606
01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:19.953
<v Speaker 1>the Internet and these new communication</v>
<v Speaker 1>channels has also made it possible to </v>

1607
01:20:22.501 --> 01:20:23.334
<v Speaker 1>deliver reasonably high quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological interventions that are </v>

1608
01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:28.253
<v Speaker 1>devoted to helping people improve their </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives and straightening themselves out </v>

1609
01:20:30.691 --> 01:20:33.300
<v Speaker 1>at extremely low cost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily widely.</v>

1610
01:20:33.690 --> 01:20:34.523
<v Speaker 1>And so now thousands and tens of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of people have done those </v>

1611
01:20:37.681 --> 01:20:38.514
<v Speaker 1>programs now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I get letters all the time from </v>

1612
01:20:39.991 --> 01:20:41.880
<v Speaker 1>people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has really helped me.</v>

1613
01:20:41.881 --> 01:20:42.714
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on the verge of suicide and this </v>

1614
01:20:43.711 --> 01:20:45.360
<v Speaker 1>brought me back from the brink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

1615
01:20:45.450 --> 01:20:47.610
<v Speaker 1>it's really nice to get letters like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1616
01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:48.473
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's something else that's </v>

1617
01:20:49.291 --> 01:20:50.850
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1618
01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:55.380
<v Speaker 1>people have been assuming that I'd been </v>
<v Speaker 1>deluged by hate mail,</v>

1619
01:20:55.410 --> 01:20:57.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're feeling kind of sorry for me.</v>

1620
01:20:57.281 --> 01:20:58.114
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've like had five pieces of hate mail </v>

1621
01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:05.970
<v Speaker 1>in the last year and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like I don't understand that it's,</v>

1622
01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:06.953
<v Speaker 1>I dunno what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the sjw types don't have the </v>

1623
01:21:09.031 --> 01:21:11.790
<v Speaker 1>energy to pen a hate letter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they certainly seem to,</v>

1624
01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:12.893
<v Speaker 1>but for some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they'll come out and protest </v>

1625
01:21:15.421 --> 01:21:16.770
<v Speaker 1>like they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcmaster,</v>

1626
01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:18.180
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>

1627
01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:23.570
<v Speaker 1>they're not really directly going after </v>
<v Speaker 1>me with,</v>

1628
01:21:23.571 --> 01:21:25.470
<v Speaker 1>with those sorts of channels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication,</v>

1629
01:21:25.471 --> 01:21:29.940
<v Speaker 1>someone spectacularly reprehensible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just littered my neighborhood.</v>

1630
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:30.833
<v Speaker 1>I actually know who it is littered my </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood with community safety </v>

1631
01:21:34.501 --> 01:21:35.550
<v Speaker 1>warnings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1632
01:21:35.551 --> 01:21:36.720
<v Speaker 1>claiming that I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1633
01:21:36.721 --> 01:21:37.554
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the General Satan himself in various </v>

1634
01:21:40.381 --> 01:21:44.040
<v Speaker 1>manifestations essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that was so funny,</v>

1635
01:21:44.130 --> 01:21:44.963
<v Speaker 1>if you find these sorts of things funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they have this picture of me </v>

1636
01:21:47.850 --> 01:21:51.210
<v Speaker 1>that's the background of the poster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm looking really aggressive,</v>

1637
01:21:51.211 --> 01:21:52.044
<v Speaker 1>a yelling like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really like I'm going to bite a </v>

1638
01:21:53.941 --> 01:21:55.210
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the,</v>

1639
01:21:55.770 --> 01:21:58.560
<v Speaker 1>that's that's the community safety </v>
<v Speaker 1>warning rights.</v>

1640
01:21:58.561 --> 01:21:59.394
<v Speaker 1>Look out for this man and here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the way they play fast and loose </v>

1641
01:22:04.171 --> 01:22:05.004
<v Speaker 1>with the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that picture was from that free </v>

1642
01:22:06.781 --> 01:22:07.614
<v Speaker 1>speech rally I told you about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that I'm yelling is </v>

1643
01:22:10.351 --> 01:22:13.920
<v Speaker 1>because the same people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I know who did it,</v>

1644
01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:14.813
<v Speaker 1>the same people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're the ones who took the microphone </v>

1645
01:22:17.071 --> 01:22:18.090
<v Speaker 1>and the PA system.</v>

1646
01:22:18.090 --> 01:22:21.420
<v Speaker 1>And so the only way I could communicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the crowd was to yell.</v>

1647
01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:24.310
<v Speaker 1>And so I look kind of aggressive and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was kind of irritated day.</v>

1648
01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:25.153
<v Speaker 1>It's like what the hell white noise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're blasting me with white noise and </v>

1649
01:22:28.501 --> 01:22:30.930
<v Speaker 1>you're taking the amps and no one's </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing anything about it.</v>

1650
01:22:30.931 --> 01:22:31.764
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm not going to stop talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're because of your dopey </v>

1651
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:36.720
<v Speaker 1>tricks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was,</v>

1652
01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:37.613
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonably fired up and I had to talk </v>

1653
01:22:39.601 --> 01:22:42.240
<v Speaker 1>really loudly cause there was white </v>
<v Speaker 1>noise blaring.</v>

1654
01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:43.343
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the picture that they use </v>
<v Speaker 1>to show the demonic side of Jordan </v>

1655
01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:48.690
<v Speaker 1>Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's such a lie.</v>

1656
01:22:48.691 --> 01:22:49.524
<v Speaker 1>Aa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the lies embedded right in the </v>

1657
01:22:50.761 --> 01:22:51.594
<v Speaker 1>poster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the only thing you could find </v>

1658
01:22:53.551 --> 01:22:54.384
<v Speaker 1>that would make me look reprehensible is</v>
<v Speaker 1>an action that I took as a direct </v>

1659
01:22:57.061 --> 01:23:00.000
<v Speaker 1>consequence of your misbehavior in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>public forum.</v>

1660
01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:01.313
<v Speaker 1>But they don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't care or maybe they do care </v>

1661
01:23:03.931 --> 01:23:06.970
<v Speaker 1>and maybe they're happy that the base of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poster is a,</v>

1662
01:23:07.210 --> 01:23:10.030
<v Speaker 1>is there an extraordinarily deceptive </v>
<v Speaker 1>false hood?</v>

1663
01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:12.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're happy about that.</v>

1664
01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:14.950
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1665
01:23:14.951 --> 01:23:15.880
<v Speaker 1>so let's sum up,</v>

1666
01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:18.940
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1667
01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:19.773
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to make a case for the </v>

1668
01:23:20.741 --> 01:23:24.280
<v Speaker 1>antipathy of the old media to the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>media because I've actually been treated</v>

1669
01:23:24.281 --> 01:23:25.114
<v Speaker 1>pretty well by the old media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell you that the Canadian </v>

1670
01:23:28.091 --> 01:23:28.924
<v Speaker 1>journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that you respect are very much </v>

1671
01:23:31.241 --> 01:23:32.074
<v Speaker 1>afraid for their personal safety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the reputation and for their </v>

1672
01:23:37.091 --> 01:23:40.630
<v Speaker 1>livelihood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they're actually quite brave.</v>

1673
01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:41.733
<v Speaker 1>Margaret went is a good example of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so are the other people that I </v>

1674
01:23:44.201 --> 01:23:45.034
<v Speaker 1>listed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christie Blatchford is another one and </v>

1675
01:23:46.671 --> 01:23:48.380
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's an anti Nela</v>

1676
01:23:50.510 --> 01:23:53.920
<v Speaker 1>still didn't get it</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>

1677
01:23:54.190 --> 01:23:55.023
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like they're high and mighty</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who have a tremendous amount of </v>

1678
01:23:58.091 --> 01:24:01.310
<v Speaker 1>power who are like misusing their status</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1679
01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:03.580
<v Speaker 1>They're not there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're walking on eggshells.</v>

1680
01:24:03.581 --> 01:24:08.581
<v Speaker 1>All those media empires are crumbling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crumbling,</v>

1681
01:24:08.591 --> 01:24:10.360
<v Speaker 1>like mad the globe and Mail is </v>
<v Speaker 1>crumbling.</v>

1682
01:24:10.361 --> 01:24:11.194
<v Speaker 1>CBC is crumbling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't get anybody to watch any of </v>

1683
01:24:13.541 --> 01:24:15.850
<v Speaker 1>their stuff online because they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the,</v>

1684
01:24:16.210 --> 01:24:17.043
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1685
01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:18.213
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1686
01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:19.450
<v Speaker 1>the ethos.</v>

1687
01:24:20.110 --> 01:24:24.340
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see it as a polarization exactly</v>

1688
01:24:24.341 --> 01:24:25.174
<v Speaker 1>between the old media and the new media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just see it as we're in the brave new </v>

1689
01:24:28.331 --> 01:24:32.020
<v Speaker 1>world of instantaneous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>permanent verbal communication.</v>

1690
01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:33.033
<v Speaker 1>And no one has any idea what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's producing all these strange </v>

1691
01:24:37.511 --> 01:24:38.344
<v Speaker 1>phenomena like these new youtube stars </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have really come out of nowhere </v>

1692
01:24:41.890 --> 01:24:43.390
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1693
01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:47.540
<v Speaker 1>and people are attracted to them because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the raw [inaudible] and their,</v>

1694
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:49.510
<v Speaker 1>and their unedited quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1695
01:24:49.511 --> 01:24:51.880
<v Speaker 1>when Joe Rogan posts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hosts posts a video,</v>

1696
01:24:51.881 --> 01:24:52.714
<v Speaker 1>it's every bit of it's posted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get to make up your own mind </v>

1697
01:24:55.751 --> 01:24:56.584
<v Speaker 1>about what you're going to conclude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that seems to be a really good </v>

1698
01:24:59.051 --> 01:24:59.884
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that means that free speech is </v>

1699
01:25:01.031 --> 01:25:02.330
<v Speaker 1>alive and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1700
01:25:02.331 --> 01:25:05.170
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it's even flourishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

1701
01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:08.273
<v Speaker 1>So I can't draw any real conclusions </v>
<v Speaker 1>about where we're at with regards to </v>

1702
01:25:13.051 --> 01:25:15.700
<v Speaker 1>media except the one I started with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

1703
01:25:15.730 --> 01:25:18.480
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's sort of related to this message</v>

1704
01:25:18.481 --> 01:25:20.630
<v Speaker 1>of personal responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>

1705
01:25:22.330 --> 01:25:25.480
<v Speaker 1>your voice is amplified far beyond what </v>
<v Speaker 1>it ever has been in the past.</v>

1706
01:25:25.481 --> 01:25:29.470
<v Speaker 1>If for every single one of us and it can</v>
<v Speaker 1>get amplified if you're not careful,</v>

1707
01:25:29.471 --> 01:25:33.490
<v Speaker 1>it can get amplified way more than you'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever hope or suspect.</v>

1708
01:25:33.491 --> 01:25:34.091
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1709
01:25:34.091 --> 01:25:36.670
<v Speaker 1>if you make the wrong mistake in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

1710
01:25:36.671 --> 01:25:39.910
<v Speaker 1>at some point you could be the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>viral video.</v>

1711
01:25:40.210 --> 01:25:43.000
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's pretty terrifying thought and</v>

1712
01:25:43.001 --> 01:25:45.190
<v Speaker 1>it's no wonder people are anxious about </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>

1713
01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:48.220
<v Speaker 1>But I do think it amplifies your effect </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the world.</v>

1714
01:25:48.221 --> 01:25:52.030
<v Speaker 1>And so it's all the more reason to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>your act together and to be careful with</v>

1715
01:25:52.031 --> 01:25:54.040
<v Speaker 1>what you say and be careful with what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>

1716
01:25:54.041 --> 01:25:54.874
<v Speaker 1>Because now we're at a point in history </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the fact that you're intimately </v>

1717
01:25:59.170 --> 01:26:04.170
<v Speaker 1>connected with the rest of mankind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say present and future is manifest</v>

1718
01:26:04.731 --> 01:26:05.564
<v Speaker 1>almost instantaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we need to take that seriously and </v>

1719
01:26:09.290 --> 01:26:10.123
<v Speaker 1>hopefully we can take it seriously </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough so that we ramp the polarization </v>

1720
01:26:14.061 --> 01:26:15.470
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1721
01:26:15.471 --> 01:26:16.304
<v Speaker 1>and figure out how to communicate with </v>
<v Speaker 1>one another and put things straight </v>

1722
01:26:18.951 --> 01:26:22.340
<v Speaker 1>again at a deep level so that we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>move towards a positive future.</v>

1723
01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:23.840
<v Speaker 1>Cause we could have one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1724
01:26:24.230 --> 01:26:25.063
<v Speaker 1>like things are shaky and chaotic right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now in strange and surreal on multiple </v>

1725
01:26:29.631 --> 01:26:30.464
<v Speaker 1>dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're also on the cusp of a </v>

1726
01:26:31.851 --> 01:26:32.684
<v Speaker 1>technological revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the likes of which no one can even </v>

1727
01:26:34.971 --> 01:26:38.900
<v Speaker 1>conceive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe things could become incredibly</v>

1728
01:26:38.901 --> 01:26:42.530
<v Speaker 1>much better if we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we walk carefully and think carefully</v>

1729
01:26:42.531 --> 01:26:44.240
<v Speaker 1>and orient ourselves properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1730
01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:45.513
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's what I hope that we all </v>

1731
01:26:47.601 --> 01:26:48.434
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I'm trying to promote </v>

1732
01:26:49.731 --> 01:26:51.890
<v Speaker 1>when I do my videos and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1733
01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:53.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that seems to,</v>

1734
01:26:54.230 --> 01:26:57.380
<v Speaker 1>people seem to find that useful and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually seem to be doing it.</v>

1735
01:26:57.381 --> 01:26:58.214
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's better than engaging </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the polarized wars and trying to be </v>

1736
01:27:01.161 --> 01:27:03.050
<v Speaker 1>right and when the arguments and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1737
01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:05.600
<v Speaker 1>because I just don't think that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to work.</v>

1738
01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:06.973
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so be careful and be awake and pay </v>

1739
01:27:12.021 --> 01:27:15.140
<v Speaker 1>attention to what you say and clean up </v>
<v Speaker 1>your rooms.</v>

1740
01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:18.590
<v Speaker 1>And that's good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

1741
01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:26.900
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

1742
01:27:30.180 --> 01:27:31.110
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1743
01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:32.393
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1744
01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:38.780
<v Speaker 1>So our next thing will be the q and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>paddle.</v>

1745
01:27:38.810 --> 01:27:41.180
<v Speaker 1>We will get that going as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

1746
01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:42.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the moment,</v>

1747
01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:44.930
<v Speaker 1>we are millennials and we do want some </v>
<v Speaker 1>group pictures,</v>

1748
01:27:44.990 --> 01:27:46.340
<v Speaker 1>so bear with us.</v>

1749
01:27:52.290 --> 01:27:53.123
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
