00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:05.503
<v Speaker 1>Hi everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the October version of the q </v>

2
00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:12.950
<v Speaker 1>and a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.960
<v Speaker 1>hopefully all my technology will work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing that it ever does.</v>

4
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.390
<v Speaker 1>Q and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>

5
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully all my,</v>

6
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.673
<v Speaker 1>apparently it is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me catch you up to date on some </v>

7
00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:31.454
<v Speaker 1>news first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be fun as far as I'm </v>

8
00:00:33.591 --> 00:00:36.410
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing I want to do is share</v>

9
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.440
<v Speaker 1>something with you and that's this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I got this in the mail yesterday from</v>

10
00:00:45.171 --> 00:00:47.420
<v Speaker 1>Penguin UK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from an editor,</v>

11
00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:48.254
<v Speaker 1>nick skidmore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I've been working with for several </v>

12
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.923
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this is the 50th anniversary </v>

13
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.153
<v Speaker 1>version of Alexander Solzhenitsyn's </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gulag archipelago in it's abridged form </v>

14
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.420
<v Speaker 1>one volume abridged form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he approved.</v>

15
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.053
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also published on the centenary </v>

16
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.050
<v Speaker 1>centenery of his birth and I was invited</v>
<v Speaker 1>to write a foreword to it,</v>

17
00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:16.580
<v Speaker 1>which I completed and which seemed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>meet with dissatisfaction of the editors</v>

18
00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:19.490
<v Speaker 1>and also soldier Knutson's family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

19
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.353
<v Speaker 1>it's about</v>

20
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.903
<v Speaker 1>500 pages long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is much shorter than the original </v>

21
00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:27.680
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was about 1800 pages.</v>

22
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.320
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn's approve the abridgment.</v>

23
00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:35.060
<v Speaker 1>I think I might've said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a remarkable piece of literature</v>

24
00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:35.894
<v Speaker 1>and history and arguably the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>influential historical document of the </v>

25
00:01:41.661 --> 00:01:43.700
<v Speaker 1>20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could make that case.</v>

26
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.043
<v Speaker 1>And so it was really unbelievably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an unbelievable privilege to be </v>

27
00:01:48.651 --> 00:01:51.410
<v Speaker 1>asked to write the foreword.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I hope that I did a credible job.</v>

28
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.460
<v Speaker 1>We'll see about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on sale as of November 1st now I've</v>

29
00:01:55.461 --> 00:01:59.960
<v Speaker 1>also prepared a youtube video for it </v>
<v Speaker 1>where I've read the foreword and some of</v>

30
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:02.510
<v Speaker 1>the content of the book to provide </v>
<v Speaker 1>people with an introduction.</v>

31
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.883
<v Speaker 1>And I'm hoping that this will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>something approximating a literary </v>

32
00:02:06.861 --> 00:02:07.694
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I invite you to pick up the book if </v>

33
00:02:09.351 --> 00:02:13.100
<v Speaker 1>you'd like to and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and prepare to be</v>

34
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.433
<v Speaker 1>shocked to your core,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose is the proper way of thinking </v>

35
00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:20.540
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there you go.</v>

36
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.090
<v Speaker 1>So that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next thing.</v>

37
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.630
<v Speaker 1>I was in New York the other day </v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday,</v>

38
00:02:26.631 --> 00:02:27.464
<v Speaker 1>literally finalizing what I hope is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal for my second book and perhaps </v>

39
00:02:32.721 --> 00:02:34.760
<v Speaker 1>books after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly for the second book,</v>

40
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.800
<v Speaker 1>which is tentatively entitled</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 more rules for life.</v>

41
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.050
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

42
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.980
<v Speaker 1>originally there were 42 rules and</v>

43
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.400
<v Speaker 1>I haven't used them all up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's plenty of reason for</v>

44
00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.430
<v Speaker 1>continuing as far as I'm concerned and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've written a bit of it and it seems to</v>

45
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 1>be going well and I'm hoping that I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>do a better job with the second book.</v>

46
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:05.824
<v Speaker 1>That's the goal and that's what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed with the editorial team is </v>

47
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:08.644
<v Speaker 1>that I want the next book to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>substantially better than the last one </v>

48
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:15.580
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully I can manage that.</v>

49
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:16.683
<v Speaker 1>So that's well and good as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping that I'd have that book done </v>

50
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:20.974
<v Speaker 1>by next September,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something approximating that maybe for </v>

51
00:03:24.281 --> 00:03:28.600
<v Speaker 1>publication the following January.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I've got a year after that if I need</v>

52
00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 1>it depending on what happens this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's the plan.</v>

53
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.410
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm going to tell you a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit about what's happening</v>

54
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.150
<v Speaker 1>with me</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the next,</v>

55
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.583
<v Speaker 1>I suppose year really it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might as well tell you that maybe </v>

56
00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be interested in knowing.</v>

57
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.570
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that tonight I'm going with Tammy,</v>

58
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.613
<v Speaker 1>my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's been traveling with me this whole </v>

59
00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:52.491
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've,</v>

60
00:03:52.491 --> 00:03:57.310
<v Speaker 1>we've finished 85 cities in the tour so </v>
<v Speaker 1>far and they've gone really well.</v>

61
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.370
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've spoken to about 250,000 people.</v>

62
00:04:00.371 --> 00:04:01.204
<v Speaker 1>I've been traveling with Dave Rubin of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Rubin report and that's been </v>

63
00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:04.084
<v Speaker 1>entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very comical and has been a good </v>

64
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.480
<v Speaker 1>adjunct to add a bit of levity and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain degree of seriousness,</v>

65
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.583
<v Speaker 1>so that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on Sunday I'm speaking in Dublin and </v>

66
00:04:15.431 --> 00:04:19.060
<v Speaker 1>on the 23rd that's Tuesday on Oslo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just go through the cities.</v>

67
00:04:19.061 --> 00:04:19.894
<v Speaker 1>You can look up the dates at Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pete peterson.com forward slash events </v>

<v Speaker 1>Helsinki,</v>

72
00:04:29.351 --> 00:04:30.910
<v Speaker 1>Stockholm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Copenhagen,</v>

73
00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Birmingham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oswald,</v>

74
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.093
<v Speaker 1>Stockholm and Helsinki.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that ends November 11th then I'm off </v>

75
00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:37.084
<v Speaker 1>with Tammy to Spain and Portugal to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>to book publishers there and then I'm </v>

76
00:04:40.721 --> 00:04:41.554
<v Speaker 1>going to speak to the trilateral </v>
<v Speaker 1>commission in Slovenia in Lubyanka and </v>

77
00:04:46.091 --> 00:04:47.350
<v Speaker 1>then we're going to Hawaii.</v>

78
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.280
<v Speaker 1>I have a talk in Hawaii in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's at the end of November,</v>

79
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:52.503
<v Speaker 1>then to New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm going to talk to doctor Oz </v>

80
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:55.810
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not finalized,</v>

81
00:04:55.811 --> 00:04:56.644
<v Speaker 1>but it seems probable than I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington to talk to some people there </v>

82
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.360
<v Speaker 1>and then to Florida for a bit of a break</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Canadian winter even though I won't</v>

83
00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:06.790
<v Speaker 1>have experienced any of that so far this</v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

84
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.983
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a speaking engagement there as </v>

85
00:05:10.631 --> 00:05:12.520
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in January,</v>

86
00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:13.354
<v Speaker 1>possibly I'll be in California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've applied for a tech incubator in </v>

87
00:05:19.301 --> 00:05:24.301
<v Speaker 1>California to further the development of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our educational software,</v>

88
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.203
<v Speaker 1>which is already at the prototype stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know for sure that will be </v>

89
00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:32.380
<v Speaker 1>accepted into the incubator and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know for sure if we are accepted,</v>

90
00:05:32.381 --> 00:05:35.980
<v Speaker 1>if that that's the route we're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>take because there are other options.</v>

91
00:05:35.981 --> 00:05:40.630
<v Speaker 1>We're also working with a private school</v>
<v Speaker 1>consortium to test the software,</v>

92
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we develop it.</v>

93
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Because when you're developing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>product,</v>

94
00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:46.840
<v Speaker 1>this is a good thing to know if you ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>do build something,</v>

95
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.230
<v Speaker 1>you want to build a product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>test it with your potential customers,</v>

96
00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:52.420
<v Speaker 1>build it again because you've made all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of mistakes,</v>

97
00:05:52.421 --> 00:05:54.280
<v Speaker 1>test it with your customers and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

98
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.000
<v Speaker 1>and then after that going to Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand,</v>

99
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.163
<v Speaker 1>probably to talk in about a dozen places</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and then back to Europe in March </v>

100
00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:06.260
<v Speaker 1>and April.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm going to write nonstop,</v>

101
00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:09.320
<v Speaker 1>I hope from May to September.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then with any luck,</v>

102
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:11.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start the biblical series </v>
<v Speaker 1>again with exodus.</v>

103
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.930
<v Speaker 1>And so that's that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the plan.</v>

104
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:16.430
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

105
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.300
<v Speaker 1>it's exciting and daunting and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>

106
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:21.670
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

107
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.450
<v Speaker 1>now you're up to date and hopefully that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was interesting.</v>

108
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:31.310
<v Speaker 1>I really am thrilled about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is really something then Mitch,</v>

109
00:06:31.311 --> 00:06:33.080
<v Speaker 1>really something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

110
00:06:33.081 --> 00:06:34.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>

111
00:06:34.091 --> 00:06:38.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm the soldier knits and family was </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy with the forward,</v>

112
00:06:38.301 --> 00:06:39.134
<v Speaker 1>so that was really</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive and hopefully it'll bring a </v>

113
00:06:45.781 --> 00:06:48.000
<v Speaker 1>whole new audience to the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be a good thing.</v>

114
00:06:48.001 --> 00:06:50.670
<v Speaker 1>This is not something that we should </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever forget ever.</v>

115
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say,</v>

116
00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.000
<v Speaker 1>let's go to some questions here.</v>

117
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Any advice for a young counselor as soon</v>
<v Speaker 1>to finish his degree?</v>

118
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.440
<v Speaker 1>What do you wish you knew as a young </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapist?</v>

119
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's start with advice.</v>

120
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.253
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well one thing I would say is you could </v>

121
00:07:10.691 --> 00:07:13.600
<v Speaker 1>go to my book list and read the books </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are there.</v>

122
00:07:13.601 --> 00:07:18.460
<v Speaker 1>There's ad on my website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a list of recommended books,</v>

123
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.323
<v Speaker 1>fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonfiction and the nonfiction is </v>

124
00:07:21.461 --> 00:07:24.310
<v Speaker 1>categorized in different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a psychotherapy section,</v>

125
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.410
<v Speaker 1>I would say read those books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

126
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.080
<v Speaker 1>that would be helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people,</v>

127
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.750
<v Speaker 1>young Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogers,</v>

128
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.033
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something by Adler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unreal and Borchez some of the </v>

129
00:07:35.891 --> 00:07:38.980
<v Speaker 1>existentialists from the 1950s.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

130
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.980
<v Speaker 1>lot of neuroscientists types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

131
00:07:41.981 --> 00:07:43.270
<v Speaker 1>very smart people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

132
00:07:43.271 --> 00:07:45.040
<v Speaker 1>very useful to know what they had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

133
00:07:45.041 --> 00:07:49.810
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the next thing I would suggest,</v>

134
00:07:49.811 --> 00:07:52.300
<v Speaker 1>and you've heard this from me before </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps,</v>

135
00:07:52.301 --> 00:07:53.134
<v Speaker 1>is that it's almost impossible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>overestimate the degree to which merely </v>

136
00:07:59.891 --> 00:08:02.290
<v Speaker 1>listening is helpful if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>counselor.</v>

137
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Lots of people have no one to listen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have no one that will listen to them.</v>

138
00:08:06.851 --> 00:08:10.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's a real problem because people</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually think by talking.</v>

139
00:08:10.481 --> 00:08:14.740
<v Speaker 1>And so for many people who are isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have no one to talk to.</v>

140
00:08:14.741 --> 00:08:17.320
<v Speaker 1>So that means they don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that means that their,</v>

141
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.920
<v Speaker 1>their thoughts aren't straight and </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized.</v>

142
00:08:20.921 --> 00:08:24.490
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why does that matter?</v>

143
00:08:24.491 --> 00:08:29.491
<v Speaker 1>But the reason it matters is because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best analogy I would say to two thoughts</v>

144
00:08:31.721 --> 00:08:36.540
<v Speaker 1>is that the best way of conceptualizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the structure of your thoughts is to can</v>

145
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:41.760
<v Speaker 1>consider it in the same manner that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might consider a map and your map should</v>

146
00:08:43.601 --> 00:08:45.580
<v Speaker 1>be organized and things should be in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right place.</v>

147
00:08:45.581 --> 00:08:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Because otherwise when you use the map </v>
<v Speaker 1>to navigate in the world,</v>

148
00:08:48.581 --> 00:08:49.414
<v Speaker 1>you don't end up where you want to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you run into things that you don't </v>

149
00:08:52.721 --> 00:08:53.710
<v Speaker 1>want to encounter.</v>

150
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:54.933
<v Speaker 1>And so it's actually necessary to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>your thoughts in order since they help </v>

151
00:08:59.161 --> 00:09:01.470
<v Speaker 1>you simulate the world before you act in</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

152
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.850
<v Speaker 1>And so don't underestimate how important</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is just to listen.</v>

153
00:09:05.851 --> 00:09:08.190
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's think about listening to,</v>

154
00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:10.500
<v Speaker 1>so someone comes to you and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they come to you because they have a</v>

155
00:09:10.501 --> 00:09:13.590
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you don't know what their problem is</v>

156
00:09:13.591 --> 00:09:16.230
<v Speaker 1>and neither do they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you know is that they have enough of</v>

157
00:09:16.231 --> 00:09:17.064
<v Speaker 1>a problem to come and talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then they might have a problem </v>

158
00:09:19.711 --> 00:09:20.544
<v Speaker 1>because really terrible things have </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to them and anyone with any </v>

159
00:09:23.191 --> 00:09:24.024
<v Speaker 1>sense would have a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then they have problems in lives </v>

160
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.050
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in life say,</v>

161
00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:31.110
<v Speaker 1>or they have the existential problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really psychological problems,</v>

162
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.063
<v Speaker 1>even though it might be psychologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>a demanding to adapt to the real </v>

163
00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:37.170
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

164
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.000
<v Speaker 1>You want to listen and you want to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

165
00:09:39.001 --> 00:09:39.834
<v Speaker 1>well what exactly is the problem space </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how much of that is practical and </v>

166
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:45.204
<v Speaker 1>how much of it is psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first issue is you don't know </v>

167
00:09:48.661 --> 00:09:49.494
<v Speaker 1>what the problem is and you want to ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of questions to find out what it </v>

168
00:09:52.471 --> 00:09:53.610
<v Speaker 1>is and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

169
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:54.563
<v Speaker 1>and also what it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because often people will come in and </v>

170
00:09:57.271 --> 00:10:00.660
<v Speaker 1>they're upset and they don't exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>know why they're upset.</v>

171
00:10:00.661 --> 00:10:03.240
<v Speaker 1>And they might be upset about a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of things.</v>

172
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:04.283
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't until after they talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>through all the things they might be </v>

173
00:10:06.991 --> 00:10:07.824
<v Speaker 1>upset about that they find out what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're upset about and what they're </v>

174
00:10:10.501 --> 00:10:13.020
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So another reason to listen,</v>

175
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.093
<v Speaker 1>especially at this stage of problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulation is to help people decide </v>

176
00:10:16.261 --> 00:10:17.094
<v Speaker 1>what their problems aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then the next thing you have to do </v>

177
00:10:19.691 --> 00:10:20.820
<v Speaker 1>to listen is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

178
00:10:20.821 --> 00:10:22.830
<v Speaker 1>well now we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know what the problem is.</v>

179
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:23.993
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would your client view as a </v>

180
00:10:29.131 --> 00:10:29.964
<v Speaker 1>potential solution?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So assuming that this could be made </v>

181
00:10:32.221 --> 00:10:36.270
<v Speaker 1>better in some manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would better look like?</v>

182
00:10:36.271 --> 00:10:40.770
<v Speaker 1>So you need to develop code,</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop a philosophy of what's better.</v>

183
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:45.090
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a goal or an aim and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like a personalized definition of</v>

184
00:10:45.091 --> 00:10:47.190
<v Speaker 1>mental health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it might be better to think about it</v>

185
00:10:47.191 --> 00:10:49.760
<v Speaker 1>as a personalized definition of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

186
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.710
<v Speaker 1>of a good life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

187
00:10:52.711 --> 00:10:54.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the next thing you have to listen</v>

188
00:10:54.871 --> 00:10:55.704
<v Speaker 1>to about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the last thing you have to </v>

189
00:10:56.461 --> 00:10:58.470
<v Speaker 1>listen about and negotiated as well as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

190
00:10:58.471 --> 00:10:59.304
<v Speaker 1>well now we know what your problem is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we know hypothetically what the </v>

191
00:11:02.761 --> 00:11:03.594
<v Speaker 1>destination is with regards to solving </v>
<v Speaker 1>that problem is what are the strategies </v>

192
00:11:07.531 --> 00:11:12.531
<v Speaker 1>that are necessary to implement in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make that positive outcome ochre?</v>

193
00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.410
<v Speaker 1>And then that's something that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiate by listening every week.</v>

194
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:16.981
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

195
00:11:16.981 --> 00:11:17.814
<v Speaker 1>well here's the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What steps could we take that you would </v>

196
00:11:21.481 --> 00:11:23.850
<v Speaker 1>implement that would move you towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>that goal?</v>

197
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.900
<v Speaker 1>Can you take those steps in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will you do that this week?</v>

198
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:28.823
<v Speaker 1>And then watch whether or not you do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and come back and report and also tell </v>

199
00:11:31.621 --> 00:11:35.370
<v Speaker 1>me and yourself whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>implementing that actually worked.</v>

200
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:36.593
<v Speaker 1>And then we can come back and we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a discussion about whether you did </v>

201
00:11:38.971 --> 00:11:40.590
<v Speaker 1>it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you didn't,</v>

202
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.540
<v Speaker 1>then how we could modify that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you did,</v>

203
00:11:42.541 --> 00:11:45.420
<v Speaker 1>how we could continue and expanded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you did do it,</v>

204
00:11:45.421 --> 00:11:46.254
<v Speaker 1>whether it worked and if it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it and what unexpected things </v>

205
00:11:48.601 --> 00:11:49.434
<v Speaker 1>occurred and what if any implications </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are for understanding problem and </v>

206
00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:57.260
<v Speaker 1>for your goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you know you,</v>

207
00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:58.810
<v Speaker 1>you need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a map.</v>

208
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:00.220
<v Speaker 1>You have a starting point.</v>

209
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.430
<v Speaker 1>You have to figure out what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a destination point,</v>

210
00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:05.920
<v Speaker 1>the desired future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to figure out what that is.</v>

211
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:06.933
<v Speaker 1>You have to implement and design </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategies that will move the person </v>

212
00:12:09.341 --> 00:12:10.174
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to test all those </v>

213
00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:13.000
<v Speaker 1>strategies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very strategic thinking,</v>

214
00:12:13.001 --> 00:12:15.520
<v Speaker 1>very practical thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

215
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:17.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

216
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:21.850
<v Speaker 1>that's an outline of how to do effective</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy.</v>

217
00:12:21.851 --> 00:12:24.340
<v Speaker 1>I would say effective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>careful psychotherapy.</v>

218
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:25.323
<v Speaker 1>And another bit of advice is people </v>
<v Speaker 1>often who are young counselors are </v>

219
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:34.060
<v Speaker 1>afraid and don't know how they can not </v>
<v Speaker 1>take their client's problems home.</v>

220
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.610
<v Speaker 1>And I've got a couple of things to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

221
00:12:36.611 --> 00:12:41.611
<v Speaker 1>The first is they're not your problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's very important to remember that</v>

222
00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:46.930
<v Speaker 1>it's partly you don't want to steal your</v>
<v Speaker 1>client's problems.</v>

223
00:12:46.931 --> 00:12:47.711
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

224
00:12:47.711 --> 00:12:48.544
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I could take my client's problems on </v>

225
00:12:49.721 --> 00:12:52.280
<v Speaker 1>myself and lift the burden from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mall,</v>

226
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.290
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't that be better?</v>

227
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.850
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

228
00:12:54.851 --> 00:12:55.684
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because someone's problems are not that </v>

229
00:12:57.971 --> 00:12:58.804
<v Speaker 1>distinguishable from their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you're there to do is </v>

230
00:13:01.241 --> 00:13:02.074
<v Speaker 1>facilitate their ability to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to grapple successfully with the </v>

231
00:13:06.551 --> 00:13:09.190
<v Speaker 1>existential vagaries of their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

232
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:11.710
<v Speaker 1>And you don't want to leap in there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>steal it.</v>

233
00:13:11.711 --> 00:13:15.340
<v Speaker 1>Like let's say you give a spectacular </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of advice and you're going to give</v>

234
00:13:15.341 --> 00:13:17.860
<v Speaker 1>advice now and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that advisable.</v>

235
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:18.993
<v Speaker 1>Then let's say you advise someone to </v>
<v Speaker 1>solve a problem in a certain way and </v>

236
00:13:21.761 --> 00:13:23.770
<v Speaker 1>they go do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem solved.</v>

237
00:13:23.771 --> 00:13:24.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

238
00:13:24.701 --> 00:13:25.534
<v Speaker 1>the problems disappeared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't learn how to generate </v>

239
00:13:28.691 --> 00:13:29.524
<v Speaker 1>the solution to the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they're in worst shape with </v>

240
00:13:31.421 --> 00:13:34.680
<v Speaker 1>future problems and it's your victory in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some senses,</v>

241
00:13:34.681 --> 00:13:37.000
<v Speaker 1>stead of theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you don't want to,</v>

242
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:41.020
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to steal from your </v>
<v Speaker 1>clients destiny.</v>

243
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:42.423
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that also frees you up to some </v>

244
00:13:44.081 --> 00:13:44.914
<v Speaker 1>degree because it also means that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not morally obligated to take on those </v>

245
00:13:47.981 --> 00:13:49.360
<v Speaker 1>problems and carry them home.</v>

246
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.433
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it doesn't do your client any </v>

247
00:13:52.721 --> 00:13:57.721
<v Speaker 1>good for their problems to sink you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a moral obligation,</v>

248
00:13:58.031 --> 00:13:58.864
<v Speaker 1>an ethical obligation of professional </v>
<v Speaker 1>obligation to remain sufficiently </v>

249
00:14:02.261 --> 00:14:03.094
<v Speaker 1>detached from the situation so that your</v>
<v Speaker 1>head is clear and you remain healthy </v>

250
00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.360
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your practice remains viable for the</v>

251
00:14:10.361 --> 00:14:13.270
<v Speaker 1>long run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so don't forget to protect yourself.</v>

252
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.980
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very important.</v>

253
00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.190
<v Speaker 1>Let let your clients sort out their </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

254
00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:20.410
<v Speaker 1>You're there to help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're there as a sounding board year.</v>

255
00:14:20.411 --> 00:14:22.550
<v Speaker 1>There is a strategic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

256
00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:23.493
<v Speaker 1>you're there to offer strategic advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're there to shed light on the </v>

257
00:14:25.871 --> 00:14:29.150
<v Speaker 1>symptomatology and to lay out potential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

258
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.090
<v Speaker 1>strategies for treatment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>

259
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.380
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

260
00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.230
<v Speaker 1>and that's good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't take on any more than that.</v>

261
00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.430
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

262
00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:53.960
<v Speaker 1>Procrastination and instant rule me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing seems to motivate me.</v>

263
00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.250
<v Speaker 1>Nothing seems to motivate me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do I do?</v>

264
00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:00.223
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give you some practical </v>

265
00:15:01.371 --> 00:15:02.700
<v Speaker 1>advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

266
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.823
<v Speaker 1>I would say you need a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you need a plan and not just a </v>

267
00:15:07.791 --> 00:15:10.670
<v Speaker 1>plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need a reason to implement the plan.</v>

268
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.480
<v Speaker 1>You need both of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So something motivates you.</v>

269
00:15:14.481 --> 00:15:17.990
<v Speaker 1>You already said instant gratification </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivates you.</v>

270
00:15:17.991 --> 00:15:20.090
<v Speaker 1>So you'll do things for instant </v>
<v Speaker 1>gratification.</v>

271
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.253
<v Speaker 1>Now look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instant gratification is a particular </v>

272
00:15:23.871 --> 00:15:25.970
<v Speaker 1>form of reward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called incentive reward,</v>

273
00:15:25.971 --> 00:15:28.610
<v Speaker 1>and it's mediated by dopaminergic </v>
<v Speaker 1>circuitry.</v>

274
00:15:28.611 --> 00:15:29.444
<v Speaker 1>The same circuitry that mediates reward </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of using drugs like </v>

275
00:15:32.961 --> 00:15:35.150
<v Speaker 1>cocaine or any of the drugs that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>abuse.</v>

276
00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:39.980
<v Speaker 1>And so there are certain short term </v>
<v Speaker 1>activities that are pleasurable enough.</v>

277
00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:41.050
<v Speaker 1>So they produce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

278
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:42.423
<v Speaker 1>an intrinsic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they intrinsically produce a dopamine </v>

279
00:15:44.811 --> 00:15:45.601
<v Speaker 1>kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that,</v>

280
00:15:45.601 --> 00:15:47.150
<v Speaker 1>it's instantaneous gratification.</v>

281
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:48.680
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say eating when you're hungry,</v>

282
00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.000
<v Speaker 1>at least a taste and flavor of the food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's also a satiation element</v>

283
00:15:53.001 --> 00:15:55.490
<v Speaker 1>that comes along with food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's those,</v>

284
00:15:55.491 --> 00:15:56.324
<v Speaker 1>those pleasures that speak for </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves when you're looking at the </v>

285
00:15:59.211 --> 00:16:03.620
<v Speaker 1>long run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are rewards that are delayed</v>

286
00:16:03.621 --> 00:16:06.020
<v Speaker 1>don't produce as much of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

287
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:09.530
<v Speaker 1>a dopamine kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're not as immediately gratifying</v>

288
00:16:09.531 --> 00:16:11.060
<v Speaker 1>and they're not as gripping in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>present.</v>

289
00:16:11.061 --> 00:16:16.061
<v Speaker 1>And the way that you have to overcome </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is to generate a vision of,</v>

290
00:16:16.221 --> 00:16:17.150
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a,</v>

291
00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:20.960
<v Speaker 1>it's not a plan or a strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a philosophical vision that,</v>

292
00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.100
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

293
00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:26.750
<v Speaker 1>that justifies your life in some way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you deeply believe has to be that.</v>

294
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:27.643
<v Speaker 1>And it can't be trivial because </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise procrastination and instant </v>

295
00:16:30.081 --> 00:16:30.914
<v Speaker 1>gratification are going to rule you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we developed this program called the </v>

296
00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:36.794
<v Speaker 1>future authoring program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's part of the self authoring </v>

297
00:16:38.571 --> 00:16:38.870
<v Speaker 1>suite.</v>

298
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:39.703
<v Speaker 1>And I'll run through it very rapidly </v>
<v Speaker 1>because even if you don't use that </v>

299
00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:44.120
<v Speaker 1>program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although you could,</v>

300
00:16:44.121 --> 00:16:47.030
<v Speaker 1>because that's what it's designed for </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it makes it easier.</v>

301
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.133
<v Speaker 1>It outlines what's necessary in order to</v>
<v Speaker 1>overcome the problem that you're </v>

302
00:16:50.871 --> 00:16:51.704
<v Speaker 1>describing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first question you might ask </v>

303
00:16:53.211 --> 00:16:54.080
<v Speaker 1>yourself is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

304
00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:55.723
<v Speaker 1>what would you need to gain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to have a real dialogue </v>

305
00:16:58.071 --> 00:16:58.904
<v Speaker 1>with yourself to understand this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll have to take yourself warts and </v>

306
00:17:00.651 --> 00:17:03.200
<v Speaker 1>all your useless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>procrastinating,</v>

307
00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:07.970
<v Speaker 1>instant gratification seeking self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to sit down and say,</v>

308
00:17:07.971 --> 00:17:08.804
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

309
00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:13.130
<v Speaker 1>you're talking to your inner badly </v>
<v Speaker 1>behaved six year old.</v>

310
00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.053
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

311
00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:15.043
<v Speaker 1>what is it that you would have to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to commit to something in the </v>

312
00:17:18.651 --> 00:17:19.880
<v Speaker 1>long run?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

313
00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:24.910
<v Speaker 1>What kind of vision of the future would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would justify sacrifices for you?</v>

314
00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:26.931
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

315
00:17:26.931 --> 00:17:27.710
<v Speaker 1>you don't know.</v>

316
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:28.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

317
00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.230
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you have to break it down.</v>

318
00:17:30.231 --> 00:17:33.020
<v Speaker 1>So let me ask you some questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might think,</v>

319
00:17:33.021 --> 00:17:33.854
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's some things that people need in </v>

320
00:17:34.791 --> 00:17:38.180
<v Speaker 1>their life because your life is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be solid,</v>

321
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.790
<v Speaker 1>grounded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gratifying,</v>

322
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:43.100
<v Speaker 1>acceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful,</v>

323
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:45.800
<v Speaker 1>relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

324
00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:51.250
<v Speaker 1>devoid of earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shaking anxiety without managing some of</v>

325
00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:52.194
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people need an intimate </v>

326
00:17:53.551 --> 00:17:54.384
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a long term intimate relationship </v>

327
00:17:56.761 --> 00:18:00.510
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise they get lonesome and </v>
<v Speaker 1>board and crazy,</v>

328
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.620
<v Speaker 1>crazy in a different way than you get if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a longterm relationship.</v>

329
00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Worst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

330
00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need friends,</v>

331
00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.430
<v Speaker 1>they need family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that could be your,</v>

332
00:18:11.431 --> 00:18:13.080
<v Speaker 1>your birth family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your parents,</v>

333
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:14.970
<v Speaker 1>your extended family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your siblings,</v>

334
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.950
<v Speaker 1>but also children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need to,</v>

335
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.120
<v Speaker 1>to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

336
00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.600
<v Speaker 1>where does that fit into your life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your vision for that?</v>

337
00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Do you wanna get along with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents?</v>

338
00:18:22.771 --> 00:18:24.060
<v Speaker 1>You want to get along with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>siblings?</v>

339
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.460
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a strategy for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to have kids?</v>

340
00:18:26.461 --> 00:18:28.980
<v Speaker 1>At some point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to build yourself a family?</v>

341
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a job or a career.</v>

342
00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:35.470
<v Speaker 1>Now a career is intrinsically meaningful</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

343
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:36.490
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

344
00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:39.750
<v Speaker 1>and usually very demanding in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>commitment and hours,</v>

345
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:42.960
<v Speaker 1>whereas a job at least can be engaging </v>
<v Speaker 1>in worthwhile.</v>

346
00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's usually more time limited.</v>

347
00:18:44.941 --> 00:18:46.560
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you have more freedom outside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

348
00:18:46.561 --> 00:18:50.130
<v Speaker 1>but you need a job because you need </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to do and you need some,</v>

349
00:18:50.131 --> 00:18:52.710
<v Speaker 1>some routine and you need some financial</v>
<v Speaker 1>support.</v>

350
00:18:52.711 --> 00:18:54.540
<v Speaker 1>And if you can have a career and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want,</v>

351
00:18:54.541 --> 00:18:55.374
<v Speaker 1>so much the better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at least at least you could have a </v>

352
00:18:57.091 --> 00:18:59.130
<v Speaker 1>trade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something worthwhile,</v>

353
00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.800
<v Speaker 1>not that a trade can't be a career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And believe me,</v>

354
00:19:01.801 --> 00:19:03.780
<v Speaker 1>I've got nothing against traits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

355
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.050
<v Speaker 1>you need to take care of yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally and physically.</v>

356
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.330
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you want to present yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world?</v>

357
00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:10.703
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be healthy mentally and </v>

358
00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:16.040
<v Speaker 1>physically so that you're like a light </v>
<v Speaker 1>among men.</v>

359
00:19:16.041 --> 00:19:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Let's put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be a good goal.</v>

360
00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:19.573
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to handle the </v>

361
00:19:20.581 --> 00:19:22.680
<v Speaker 1>temptations of drugs and alcohol and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

362
00:19:22.681 --> 00:19:23.514
<v Speaker 1>procrastination and instant </v>
<v Speaker 1>gratification or tilting you in the </v>

363
00:19:25.711 --> 00:19:27.930
<v Speaker 1>wrong direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are,</v>

364
00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:31.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven things that you might consider sit</v>

365
00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:33.810
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the question.</v>

366
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.810
<v Speaker 1>You're taking care of yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you or someone you care about.</v>

367
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.840
<v Speaker 1>You can design a future that would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>good for you.</v>

368
00:19:39.841 --> 00:19:42.120
<v Speaker 1>If you were taking care of yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

369
00:19:42.121 --> 00:19:44.130
<v Speaker 1>For 20 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have what you want.</v>

370
00:19:44.131 --> 00:19:47.130
<v Speaker 1>It's three years down the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have whatever you want,</v>

371
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.410
<v Speaker 1>but you have to aim for it and work for </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

372
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:50.580
<v Speaker 1>and you have to specify it.</v>

373
00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:52.800
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want?</v>

374
00:19:52.801 --> 00:19:55.140
<v Speaker 1>What would make your life worthwhile?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would be good enough?</v>

375
00:19:55.141 --> 00:19:55.974
<v Speaker 1>So that instant gratification would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>an obstacle instead of a means for </v>

376
00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:00.360
<v Speaker 1>proceeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

377
00:20:00.361 --> 00:20:02.190
<v Speaker 1>I can give you an example to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>

378
00:20:02.191 --> 00:20:03.024
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was kid in my early twenties I </v>

379
00:20:05.341 --> 00:20:05.940
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

380
00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.010
<v Speaker 1>I did quite a bit of drinking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>partying.</v>

381
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:12.840
<v Speaker 1>I came from a hard drinking background </v>
<v Speaker 1>up in northern Alberta and um,</v>

382
00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:15.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was out three times a week even when I</v>

383
00:20:15.391 --> 00:20:16.224
<v Speaker 1>was in graduate school and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning to write seriously scientific </v>

384
00:20:18.991 --> 00:20:19.824
<v Speaker 1>papers and also the work that became </v>
<v Speaker 1>maps of meaning and eventually 12 rules </v>

385
00:20:22.621 --> 00:20:23.454
<v Speaker 1>for life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it came to the point where I </v>

386
00:20:24.691 --> 00:20:28.950
<v Speaker 1>couldn't do both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't go out and be that social and</v>

387
00:20:28.951 --> 00:20:32.220
<v Speaker 1>have that much instinct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instant gratifying,</v>

388
00:20:32.221 --> 00:20:35.550
<v Speaker 1>fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be in good enough shape so that if I</v>

389
00:20:35.551 --> 00:20:38.880
<v Speaker 1>was editing something complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was making it better instead of worse.</v>

390
00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.590
<v Speaker 1>And I was really interested in what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was doing.</v>

391
00:20:40.591 --> 00:20:41.424
<v Speaker 1>I was learning a lot about the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was learning a lot about alcohol and </v>

392
00:20:43.351 --> 00:20:44.184
<v Speaker 1>drug abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was laying out the platform for the </v>

393
00:20:46.651 --> 00:20:47.484
<v Speaker 1>relationship narrative and neuroscience </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was really engrossing and </v>

394
00:20:51.401 --> 00:20:54.100
<v Speaker 1>engaging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was hard and it was long term.</v>

395
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was a longterm plan or I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make a choice.</v>

396
00:20:57.071 --> 00:21:00.670
<v Speaker 1>It was either continue the fund,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was fun.</v>

397
00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:01.533
<v Speaker 1>I really enjoyed it or do this thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I really believed was more </v>

398
00:21:05.621 --> 00:21:10.600
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile and it was more worthwhile to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do the more worthwhile thing,</v>

399
00:21:10.601 --> 00:21:13.150
<v Speaker 1>which is why I stopped with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's instant gratification,</v>

400
00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:16.240
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of stopping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is true for most people,</v>

401
00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:19.810
<v Speaker 1>especially young men who tend to drink a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair bit and carouse around a lot.</v>

402
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:21.393
<v Speaker 1>Most young men stop that sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least to some degree around 25 or 26 </v>

403
00:21:26.291 --> 00:21:29.080
<v Speaker 1>and the reason they do that is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they pick up other responsibilities.</v>

404
00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:29.913
<v Speaker 1>They get a real job that has some future</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they get a relationship that's </v>

405
00:21:32.591 --> 00:21:34.420
<v Speaker 1>permanent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a family and they decide,</v>

406
00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:35.373
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's more important than the </v>

407
00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:39.580
<v Speaker 1>procrastination and the instant </v>
<v Speaker 1>gratification.</v>

408
00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:42.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so make yourself a damn plan.</v>

409
00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:43.683
<v Speaker 1>Make it into a strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could use the future authoring </v>

410
00:21:45.371 --> 00:21:47.620
<v Speaker 1>program if you like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would highly recommend that.</v>

411
00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:51.160
<v Speaker 1>Do it badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be intimidated by it.</v>

412
00:21:51.161 --> 00:21:52.570
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to plan.</v>

413
00:21:52.571 --> 00:21:53.111
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

414
00:21:53.111 --> 00:21:55.540
<v Speaker 1>we know you don't know how to plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make a bad plan.</v>

415
00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:58.510
<v Speaker 1>It's better than the one you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

416
00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:03.600
<v Speaker 1>so do it badly and then try and modify </v>
<v Speaker 1>it as as needs be and see if that works.</v>

417
00:22:03.911 --> 00:22:05.320
<v Speaker 1>You need a philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cody.</v>

418
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:07.660
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you're,</v>

419
00:22:07.661 --> 00:22:12.100
<v Speaker 1>you're living in a shallow life and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>short term avoidance,</v>

420
00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:12.963
<v Speaker 1>that's procrastination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll do that because you don't think </v>

421
00:22:15.371 --> 00:22:16.360
<v Speaker 1>it's important enough.</v>

422
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:18.063
<v Speaker 1>You don't think that the negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of not doing what you </v>

423
00:22:20.711 --> 00:22:23.050
<v Speaker 1>should do are severe enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not afraid enough of it.</v>

424
00:22:23.051 --> 00:22:25.000
<v Speaker 1>The other thing you do in the future </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoring program,</v>

425
00:22:25.001 --> 00:22:28.210
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is right about just exactly what kind of</v>

426
00:22:28.211 --> 00:22:31.990
<v Speaker 1>hell you'd be likely to descend into </v>
<v Speaker 1>three to five years in the future.</v>

427
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:32.943
<v Speaker 1>If you let your bad habits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>procrastination and instant </v>

428
00:22:35.111 --> 00:22:35.944
<v Speaker 1>gratification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say rule you and take you out of </v>

429
00:22:38.951 --> 00:22:39.784
<v Speaker 1>the game completely because you also </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to be terrified as well as hopeful </v>

430
00:22:42.851 --> 00:22:45.310
<v Speaker 1>about what you might do if you got your </v>
<v Speaker 1>act together.</v>

431
00:22:45.311 --> 00:22:49.060
<v Speaker 1>You need to be terrified about what you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you might end up if you kept being</v>

432
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.400
<v Speaker 1>like lazy and useless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

433
00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:54.430
<v Speaker 1>and shallow and that none of that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

434
00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:57.220
<v Speaker 1>So you need to be deeper and you need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>look deeper.</v>

435
00:22:57.221 --> 00:23:01.640
<v Speaker 1>You need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nisha said he who has a why can bear any</v>

436
00:23:01.641 --> 00:23:02.474
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you need a why and the why is </v>

437
00:23:04.331 --> 00:23:05.170
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

438
00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:06.850
<v Speaker 1>imagine you could have the life.</v>

439
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:07.833
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you could have a life that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be worth giving up some of the instant </v>

440
00:23:10.751 --> 00:23:14.350
<v Speaker 1>gratification for even in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would that look like?</v>

441
00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.450
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

442
00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:18.413
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think the Feminine Hero </v>

443
00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:21.483
<v Speaker 1>Journey is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you believe females have their own </v>

444
00:23:22.541 --> 00:23:23.830
<v Speaker 1>archetypal story to follow?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

445
00:23:23.831 --> 00:23:25.030
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they certainly do.</v>

446
00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.070
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first of all,</v>

447
00:23:27.071 --> 00:23:32.071
<v Speaker 1>they have the hero story like men do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think,</v>

448
00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:34.750
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the classic hero story if,</v>

449
00:23:34.751 --> 00:23:35.584
<v Speaker 1>imagine it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the classic hero's story is the </v>

450
00:23:37.181 --> 00:23:38.014
<v Speaker 1>archetypal male story with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the feminine lurking in the </v>

451
00:23:41.801 --> 00:23:44.890
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause like men are adventurous heroes,</v>

452
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:46.123
<v Speaker 1>all things considered fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're also very maternal men take </v>

453
00:23:50.211 --> 00:23:53.810
<v Speaker 1>care of children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>families for very long periods of time.</v>

454
00:23:53.811 --> 00:23:55.460
<v Speaker 1>So as far as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

455
00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:58.400
<v Speaker 1>if you think about this from a purely </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological perspective,</v>

456
00:23:58.401 --> 00:24:03.401
<v Speaker 1>human males are very maternal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So both males and females have an aspect</v>

457
00:24:05.721 --> 00:24:09.110
<v Speaker 1>to them that's archetipal typically </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine and archetypically feminine.</v>

458
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:13.640
<v Speaker 1>And I would say in the typical male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the archetype of the masculine dominates</v>

459
00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:15.740
<v Speaker 1>with the archetypically feminine in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>

460
00:24:15.741 --> 00:24:18.140
<v Speaker 1>And then the typical female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the reverse.</v>

461
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.320
<v Speaker 1>And so although there might be some </v>
<v Speaker 1>variation in that,</v>

462
00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:22.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

463
00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.173
<v Speaker 1>you get the relatively rare female who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>more archetypally male in their </v>

464
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:29.083
<v Speaker 1>orientation to the world and you get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively rare male who is more </v>

465
00:24:33.051 --> 00:24:34.580
<v Speaker 1>archetypally female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine.</v>

466
00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:35.923
<v Speaker 1>So the Dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conflict with the dragon is the </v>

467
00:24:38.901 --> 00:24:40.620
<v Speaker 1>archetipal male story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go Out,</v>

468
00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.490
<v Speaker 1>confront the drag and get the gold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring it back to the community,</v>

469
00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:46.230
<v Speaker 1>rescue the Virgin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

470
00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.173
<v Speaker 1>enable the community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why make yourself wise as a consequence </v>

471
00:24:51.231 --> 00:24:53.930
<v Speaker 1>of the adventure and develop your </v>
<v Speaker 1>character?</v>

472
00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:55.820
<v Speaker 1>That's a great story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

473
00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:57.103
<v Speaker 1>the archetypal feminine narrative at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least to some degree is beauty and the </v>

474
00:24:59.931 --> 00:25:00.764
<v Speaker 1>beast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to encounter the monstrous </v>

475
00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:09.220
<v Speaker 1>masculine and to tame and civilize it so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there,</v>

476
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:12.110
<v Speaker 1>so that a joint relationship can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>established.</v>

477
00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:17.320
<v Speaker 1>That's part and parcel of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>development of longterm intimacy.</v>

478
00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:21.290
<v Speaker 1>And that would be partly for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>purposes of intimacy,</v>

479
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:25.850
<v Speaker 1>which is particularly important to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people say who are high in agreeableness</v>

480
00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:30.260
<v Speaker 1>and women are higher in agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also as the platform for,</v>

481
00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:34.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for raising children successfully.</v>

482
00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Now you get a male variant of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the male variants of the</v>

483
00:25:39.201 --> 00:25:40.690
<v Speaker 1>same story that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

484
00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:44.180
<v Speaker 1>Eric Norman in particular talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a union commentator.</v>

485
00:25:44.181 --> 00:25:46.610
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a book called origins and </v>
<v Speaker 1>history of consciousness,</v>

486
00:25:46.611 --> 00:25:49.430
<v Speaker 1>which I would highly recommend that's on</v>
<v Speaker 1>my list of recommended readings.</v>

487
00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:52.160
<v Speaker 1>And another one called the great mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another brilliant book,</v>

488
00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:53.673
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>noise and talked about something called </v>

489
00:25:55.071 --> 00:25:58.340
<v Speaker 1>the crystallization of the anima from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the great mother archetype.</v>

490
00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:02.210
<v Speaker 1>And so you might say that that men </v>
<v Speaker 1>who've been dominated by women,</v>

491
00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:04.550
<v Speaker 1>a young boy who's been dominated by his </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>

492
00:26:04.551 --> 00:26:06.080
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a man for,</v>

493
00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:07.513
<v Speaker 1>for who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who for some reason is dominated and </v>

494
00:26:10.821 --> 00:26:14.720
<v Speaker 1>intimidated by the idea of the rejecting</v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine.</v>

495
00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:16.393
<v Speaker 1>And if you're interested in that idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could watch a documentary called </v>

496
00:26:18.771 --> 00:26:19.604
<v Speaker 1>crump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll see exactly what I mean by </v>

497
00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:24.470
<v Speaker 1>dominated by the archetipal rejecting </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine.</v>

498
00:26:24.471 --> 00:26:25.304
<v Speaker 1>I'd never seen a better example of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>that then and what's laid out in that </v>

499
00:26:29.541 --> 00:26:32.150
<v Speaker 1>documentary crump to brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary.</v>

500
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:36.620
<v Speaker 1>So the female is a hostile judge and </v>
<v Speaker 1>very critical of men.</v>

501
00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:38.670
<v Speaker 1>The Feminine Speaking Archetipal </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

502
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:43.340
<v Speaker 1>And so the man has to steel himself to </v>
<v Speaker 1>face that rejection,</v>

503
00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:44.363
<v Speaker 1>to develop his character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like a Bill Murray does in </v>

504
00:26:47.131 --> 00:26:49.320
<v Speaker 1>groundhog day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly the same story.</v>

505
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.513
<v Speaker 1>And then free the individual woman with </v>
<v Speaker 1>whom he has a relationship from the </v>

506
00:26:55.141 --> 00:26:55.974
<v Speaker 1>archetipal judgemental feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's like the male version of </v>

507
00:27:00.061 --> 00:27:02.250
<v Speaker 1>beauty and the beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then,</v>

508
00:27:02.251 --> 00:27:05.430
<v Speaker 1>and the female version,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously the hero archetype is the fact</v>

509
00:27:05.431 --> 00:27:06.264
<v Speaker 1>that women do have heroic role to play </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world as well because they </v>

510
00:27:09.871 --> 00:27:13.590
<v Speaker 1>confront the unknown just like men do </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Garner,</v>

511
00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:15.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wisdom,</v>

512
00:27:15.601 --> 00:27:18.360
<v Speaker 1>knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>riches as a consequence.</v>

513
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:20.970
<v Speaker 1>But the way I look at it is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

514
00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:21.923
<v Speaker 1>for females,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feminine archetype is at the </v>

515
00:27:23.641 --> 00:27:26.070
<v Speaker 1>forefront and the masculine at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>background and,</v>

516
00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:29.280
<v Speaker 1>and it's reversed for men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

517
00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:30.173
<v Speaker 1>that's how it looks to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you caught some twitter flack for </v>

518
00:27:34.861 --> 00:27:39.000
<v Speaker 1>your comment on Brett Kavanaugh care to </v>
<v Speaker 1>address your comment and the blowback?</v>

519
00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:39.923
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I addressed the comment because I wrote </v>

520
00:27:41.611 --> 00:27:44.730
<v Speaker 1>a blog post and so that was probably the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right way,</v>

521
00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:45.593
<v Speaker 1>not only to address it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that would have been the right way </v>

522
00:27:47.371 --> 00:27:48.670
<v Speaker 1>to handle it to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll,</v>

523
00:27:48.671 --> 00:27:49.740
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll address it.</v>

524
00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:52.940
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll address it and all address the blow</v>

525
00:27:52.941 --> 00:27:54.840
<v Speaker 1>back as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look.</v>

526
00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.153
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

527
00:27:58.150 --> 00:27:58.400
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

528
00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.233
<v Speaker 1>Just because you have an idea doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean that it's the only idea and just </v>

529
00:28:05.211 --> 00:28:08.990
<v Speaker 1>because you have an idea doesn't mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's right.</v>

530
00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:14.440
<v Speaker 1>And so like it's weird for me in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense to engage in public discourse,</v>

531
00:28:14.661 --> 00:28:18.260
<v Speaker 1>especially politically because you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd been in,</v>

532
00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:21.650
<v Speaker 1>I'd been a researcher for a very long </v>
<v Speaker 1>period of time and so most of the people</v>

533
00:28:21.651 --> 00:28:25.910
<v Speaker 1>that I've talked to about serious ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them,</v>

534
00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:30.200
<v Speaker 1>many of them have been researchers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>graduate students for example.</v>

535
00:28:30.201 --> 00:28:34.670
<v Speaker 1>And when you're talking about a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it might be,</v>

536
00:28:34.671 --> 00:28:35.504
<v Speaker 1>if your research oriented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is kind of what you do if </v>

537
00:28:39.081 --> 00:28:39.914
<v Speaker 1>you're a therapist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way I laid out advice for a young </v>

538
00:28:42.501 --> 00:28:43.610
<v Speaker 1>therapist earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

539
00:28:43.611 --> 00:28:44.444
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what does everybody think the </v>

540
00:28:47.181 --> 00:28:49.410
<v Speaker 1>problem is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you,</v>

541
00:28:49.411 --> 00:28:51.440
<v Speaker 1>you assume that you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

542
00:28:51.441 --> 00:28:52.274
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we have big discussion about what </v>

543
00:28:52.911 --> 00:28:54.590
<v Speaker 1>everybody thinks the problem is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

544
00:28:54.591 --> 00:28:55.424
<v Speaker 1>what do you think the real problem is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's the real problem with the </v>

545
00:28:58.431 --> 00:29:01.700
<v Speaker 1>cavenaugh situation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well one might be,</v>

546
00:29:01.701 --> 00:29:02.534
<v Speaker 1>well cavenaugh was accused of sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>impropriety when he was a high school </v>

547
00:29:05.661 --> 00:29:10.640
<v Speaker 1>student and because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not his suitability for the Supreme</v>

548
00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Court is in question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's the problem.</v>

549
00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:14.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

550
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:18.020
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's not the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the hell knows what the problem is?</v>

551
00:29:18.021 --> 00:29:20.450
<v Speaker 1>So here's a bunch of possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

552
00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:26.080
<v Speaker 1>we haven't had a reasonable discussion </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what constitutes an acceptable,</v>

553
00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:27.363
<v Speaker 1>a statute of limitations with regards to</v>
<v Speaker 1>accusations of misbehavior between </v>

554
00:29:32.921 --> 00:29:34.030
<v Speaker 1>individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

555
00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.193
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you accuse someone reasonably five </v>

556
00:29:37.481 --> 00:29:39.130
<v Speaker 1>years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years later,</v>

557
00:29:39.131 --> 00:29:42.130
<v Speaker 1>15 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 later.</v>

558
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.050
<v Speaker 1>Like is there a limit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

559
00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:46.690
<v Speaker 1>is there a more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have a moral obligation if you're</v>

560
00:29:46.691 --> 00:29:47.524
<v Speaker 1>going to accuse someone or even seek </v>
<v Speaker 1>justice to do that within a reasonable </v>

561
00:29:52.271 --> 00:29:54.310
<v Speaker 1>period of time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

562
00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.470
<v Speaker 1>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a problem.</v>

563
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:57.783
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly are the rules that govern </v>

564
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:02.710
<v Speaker 1>the conduct of men and women when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're young,</v>

565
00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:06.580
<v Speaker 1>when they're drinking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we going to have that conversation?</v>

566
00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:07.533
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to have that </v>

567
00:30:07.991 --> 00:30:08.824
<v Speaker 1>conversation either because no one wants</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think that through and they </v>

568
00:30:11.411 --> 00:30:13.060
<v Speaker 1>especially don't want to think it </v>
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

569
00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:14.013
<v Speaker 1>With regards to the complicating </v>
<v Speaker 1>additional feature of alcohol thing </v>

570
00:30:17.171 --> 00:30:18.004
<v Speaker 1>about alcohol is the reason that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>drink is so that they can act stupidly </v>

571
00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:24.933
<v Speaker 1>and have fun.</v>

572
00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:26.643
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem with acting stupidly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>having fun when you're sober is that it </v>

573
00:30:28.991 --> 00:30:31.120
<v Speaker 1>makes you anxious and so you don't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

574
00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.673
<v Speaker 1>But Al calls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially for people for whom alcohol </v>

575
00:30:35.051 --> 00:30:35.884
<v Speaker 1>is a good drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ramps up the excitement of impulsivity </v>

576
00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:42.460
<v Speaker 1>and quells the anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so people always drink,</v>

577
00:30:42.461 --> 00:30:45.400
<v Speaker 1>often drink because they want to go out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and be stupid and have fun.</v>

578
00:30:45.401 --> 00:30:46.234
<v Speaker 1>And look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that there's something to </v>

579
00:30:47.231 --> 00:30:49.060
<v Speaker 1>be said for stupid fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

580
00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.013
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that also needs to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be said about it is it's bloody well </v>

581
00:30:52.361 --> 00:30:55.540
<v Speaker 1>dangerous and so we don't want to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>that conversation.</v>

582
00:30:55.541 --> 00:30:57.580
<v Speaker 1>We don't have that conversation on </v>
<v Speaker 1>campuses.</v>

583
00:30:57.581 --> 00:31:01.150
<v Speaker 1>We talk about the rape crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody talks about the alcohol,</v>

584
00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:05.230
<v Speaker 1>sexual assault crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If men and women didn't drink together,</v>

585
00:31:05.231 --> 00:31:07.900
<v Speaker 1>there'd be virtually no sexual assault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

586
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:08.943
<v Speaker 1>if people didn't drink at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'd be almost no violent crime </v>

587
00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:12.213
<v Speaker 1>because alcohol contributes to violent </v>
<v Speaker 1>crime in a manner that you can hardly </v>

588
00:31:14.621 --> 00:31:15.200
<v Speaker 1>imagine.</v>

589
00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.800
<v Speaker 1>But 50% of people who are murdered are </v>
<v Speaker 1>drunk.</v>

590
00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.860
<v Speaker 1>And about 50% of the people who do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>murdering or drunk.</v>

591
00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:24.730
<v Speaker 1>And that's probably an underestimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the stats aren't kept that well.</v>

592
00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:27.400
<v Speaker 1>And it also depends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on how you define drunk.</v>

593
00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:30.460
<v Speaker 1>So that could also be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

594
00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:34.390
<v Speaker 1>well the liberals left types,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call them the left leaning.</v>

595
00:31:34.391 --> 00:31:37.060
<v Speaker 1>Progressive types,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want a conservative on the Supreme</v>

596
00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Court of the left leaning types aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy that trump won the election.</v>

597
00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:42.543
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conservatives want to rush our </v>

598
00:31:43.721 --> 00:31:44.554
<v Speaker 1>candidate onto the supreme court come </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell or high water because of the </v>

599
00:31:46.721 --> 00:31:48.520
<v Speaker 1>November election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

600
00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.260
<v Speaker 1>then there's another problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

601
00:31:50.261 --> 00:31:51.094
<v Speaker 1>is this about cavenaugh at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is this about roe and weighed in </v>

602
00:31:53.321 --> 00:31:54.650
<v Speaker 1>about abortion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

603
00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:56.141
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

604
00:31:56.141 --> 00:31:59.110
<v Speaker 1>It's about all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's an unbelievably complicated,</v>

605
00:31:59.111 --> 00:32:04.090
<v Speaker 1>godawful situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so Eric Weinstein and Bret Weinstein</v>

606
00:32:04.091 --> 00:32:06.190
<v Speaker 1>were tweeting about this and it was late</v>
<v Speaker 1>at night.</v>

607
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:08.500
<v Speaker 1>And Eric said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell,</v>

608
00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.350
<v Speaker 1>either way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not going to end well.</v>

609
00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:13.120
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>

610
00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:15.100
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there an alternative?</v>

611
00:32:15.101 --> 00:32:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Is there a way out of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

612
00:32:16.691 --> 00:32:18.040
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting question.</v>

613
00:32:18.041 --> 00:32:20.020
<v Speaker 1>What might be a way out of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

614
00:32:20.021 --> 00:32:20.854
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Calvin was in a rough position because </v>

615
00:32:22.901 --> 00:32:25.960
<v Speaker 1>he can't withdraw obviously and perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't,</v>

616
00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:29.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without his reputation being shattered.</v>

617
00:32:29.471 --> 00:32:32.710
<v Speaker 1>And if he doesn't get nominated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing is life is basically over.</v>

618
00:32:32.711 --> 00:32:34.900
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand,</v>

619
00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:36.483
<v Speaker 1>he's tangled up in a scandal that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficient merck and mud so that it </v>

620
00:32:42.801 --> 00:32:43.634
<v Speaker 1>isn't self evident that he can serve as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a supreme court justice without having </v>

621
00:32:48.531 --> 00:32:52.310
<v Speaker 1>every single one of his decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in contentious cases,</v>

622
00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:53.653
<v Speaker 1>produce a tremendous amount of social </v>
<v Speaker 1>upheaval over the next two or three </v>

623
00:32:57.051 --> 00:33:00.290
<v Speaker 1>decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't obvious that that's a great</v>

624
00:33:00.291 --> 00:33:01.124
<v Speaker 1>move forward.</v>

625
00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.810
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be fine.</v>

626
00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:04.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been</v>

627
00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:06.853
<v Speaker 1>controversy around other Supreme Court </v>
<v Speaker 1>justice nominations and that seems to </v>

628
00:33:09.681 --> 00:33:12.620
<v Speaker 1>have basically sorted itself out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I already said,</v>

629
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:16.100
<v Speaker 1>just because you're thinking something </v>
<v Speaker 1>through doesn't mean you're right.</v>

630
00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:17.361
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

631
00:33:17.361 --> 00:33:19.670
<v Speaker 1>it's a simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought,</v>

632
00:33:19.671 --> 00:33:20.504
<v Speaker 1>well if I was in cabinet has position </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I felt that my candidacy had been </v>

633
00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:29.480
<v Speaker 1>compromised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps through no fault of my own,</v>

634
00:33:29.481 --> 00:33:32.270
<v Speaker 1>I have not saying anything about his </v>
<v Speaker 1>innocence or guilt,</v>

635
00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:33.613
<v Speaker 1>but that my candidacy had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>compromised by this interminable and </v>

636
00:33:37.131 --> 00:33:37.964
<v Speaker 1>ugly scandal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that meant that my tenure on the </v>

637
00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:43.153
<v Speaker 1>Supreme Court might be marked by </v>
<v Speaker 1>culturally divisive controversy in the </v>

638
00:33:46.761 --> 00:33:47.594
<v Speaker 1>long run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it would be better for me to be </v>

639
00:33:50.031 --> 00:33:52.010
<v Speaker 1>nominated to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

640
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:53.563
<v Speaker 1>it's too murky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too muddy and I don't think the </v>

641
00:33:55.641 --> 00:33:58.820
<v Speaker 1>country is best served by my accepting </v>
<v Speaker 1>the nomination.</v>

642
00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Then the conservatives can nominate </v>
<v Speaker 1>another candidate,</v>

643
00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:06.530
<v Speaker 1>get their personal on the supreme court.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no necessary lost there.</v>

644
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:07.543
<v Speaker 1>And perhaps we could move forward with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>minimum relative minimum of </v>

645
00:34:10.671 --> 00:34:11.840
<v Speaker 1>divisiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

646
00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:17.170
<v Speaker 1>look in my blog I laid out all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why that isn't a good idea.</v>

647
00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Like here maybe if you just give me five</v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds,</v>

648
00:34:22.491 --> 00:34:23.324
<v Speaker 1>I can read some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I tried to make a steel man case </v>

649
00:34:26.451 --> 00:34:30.380
<v Speaker 1>for why my idea wasn't a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My idea about him withdrawing.</v>

650
00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:31.513
<v Speaker 1>So just give me one second and I'll read</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the potential objections just so </v>

651
00:34:35.061 --> 00:34:37.310
<v Speaker 1>that you know that I've thought them </v>
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

652
00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:38.803
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

653
00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:44.553
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

654
00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.153
<v Speaker 1>So perhaps the Democrat opposition would</v>
<v Speaker 1>mount a similar campaign against my </v>

655
00:34:49.981 --> 00:34:51.810
<v Speaker 1>punitive successor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

656
00:34:51.811 --> 00:34:53.370
<v Speaker 1>that's certainly possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

657
00:34:53.371 --> 00:34:54.204
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would provide virtually </v>

658
00:34:54.601 --> 00:34:58.800
<v Speaker 1>unassailable evidence for the purely </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulative and political motivation of</v>

659
00:34:58.801 --> 00:35:01.920
<v Speaker 1>the accusers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forcing them to duplicate their strategy</v>

660
00:35:01.921 --> 00:35:02.754
<v Speaker 1>as second time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would help reveal the machinations </v>

661
00:35:04.681 --> 00:35:07.350
<v Speaker 1>for what they were in a manner that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be virtually in dot.</v>

662
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:08.813
<v Speaker 1>Undeniable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps time is of the essence and </v>

663
00:35:10.681 --> 00:35:13.590
<v Speaker 1>there'd be no way to place another </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate of conservative leaning on the</v>

664
00:35:13.591 --> 00:35:16.920
<v Speaker 1>bench before the November elections as </v>
<v Speaker 1>they say.</v>

665
00:35:16.921 --> 00:35:18.330
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>act in haste,</v>

666
00:35:18.331 --> 00:35:21.270
<v Speaker 1>repent in leisure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

667
00:35:21.271 --> 00:35:23.400
<v Speaker 1>And then other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

668
00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:26.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments against my position.</v>

669
00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:27.810
<v Speaker 1>Here they are.</v>

670
00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:37.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If cavenaugh withdrew after being,</v>

671
00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:38.423
<v Speaker 1>here's what might happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be read as an admission of </v>

672
00:35:41.311 --> 00:35:42.144
<v Speaker 1>guilt on his part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would embolden those who would use </v>

673
00:35:44.311 --> 00:35:46.620
<v Speaker 1>reputation destruction as a political </v>
<v Speaker 1>maneuver.</v>

674
00:35:46.621 --> 00:35:47.454
<v Speaker 1>It would weaken the generally and </v>
<v Speaker 1>vitally important idea of the </v>

675
00:35:49.861 --> 00:35:50.694
<v Speaker 1>presumption of innocence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would indicate weakness on the part </v>

676
00:35:52.771 --> 00:35:55.950
<v Speaker 1>of the Republicans at a key moment prior</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the November elections.</v>

677
00:35:56.190 --> 00:36:00.570
<v Speaker 1>It would mean that an innocent man has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been successfully pilloried by a mob.</v>

678
00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:01.433
<v Speaker 1>It would validate the use of allegations</v>
<v Speaker 1>of past behavior well past any </v>

679
00:36:04.591 --> 00:36:05.424
<v Speaker 1>reasonable expiry date as a weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would destroy the Republican </v>

680
00:36:08.311 --> 00:36:11.130
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to choose a supreme court </v>
<v Speaker 1>justice hand,</v>

681
00:36:11.131 --> 00:36:13.710
<v Speaker 1>the Democrats and unearned victory </v>
<v Speaker 1>embitter bitter,</v>

682
00:36:13.711 --> 00:36:14.544
<v Speaker 1>a large percentage of the conservative </v>
<v Speaker 1>base who would regard the withdrawal as </v>

683
00:36:17.311 --> 00:36:18.144
<v Speaker 1>a betrayal and last and perhaps least </v>
<v Speaker 1>violate my own personal adage for what </v>

684
00:36:22.951 --> 00:36:23.970
<v Speaker 1>that's worth of.</v>

685
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:27.060
<v Speaker 1>Don't apologize if you haven't done </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything wrong.</v>

686
00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.193
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I understand the weaknesses of that </v>

687
00:36:29.671 --> 00:36:31.020
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

688
00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:34.020
<v Speaker 1>I was putting it forward as a potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>third alternative.</v>

689
00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:34.913
<v Speaker 1>Now look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's perfectly reasonable to put things </v>

690
00:36:36.811 --> 00:36:40.590
<v Speaker 1>to out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put things forward as alternatives.</v>

691
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:44.430
<v Speaker 1>That's thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now having said that,</v>

692
00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:46.650
<v Speaker 1>I made some mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

693
00:36:46.651 --> 00:36:47.484
<v Speaker 1>So the first mistake was</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't tweet complicated ideas in 140 </v>

694
00:36:54.631 --> 00:36:59.280
<v Speaker 1>characters about contentious issues in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the midst of a controversy at two in the</v>

695
00:36:59.281 --> 00:37:00.900
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

696
00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:01.763
<v Speaker 1>Bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the consequences of this </v>

697
00:37:03.751 --> 00:37:04.584
<v Speaker 1>for me is that I've withdrawn quite a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot over the last three weeks from </v>

698
00:37:07.081 --> 00:37:08.370
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's twitter,</v>

699
00:37:08.371 --> 00:37:09.204
<v Speaker 1>it's a very dangerous platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm taking a break from it while </v>

700
00:37:11.821 --> 00:37:15.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm reevaluating its utility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>

701
00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:16.363
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I talked to my son about this </v>

702
00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:22.140
<v Speaker 1>before and other members of my family </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we had agreed that I wasn't going to</v>

703
00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:25.710
<v Speaker 1>post anything on twitter that should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>made into a blog.</v>

704
00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:29.430
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with twitter is that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the problem with me,</v>

705
00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:30.323
<v Speaker 1>who knows where the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that twitter invites and facilitates </v>

706
00:37:34.411 --> 00:37:35.244
<v Speaker 1>impulsive responding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm not convinced that it's </v>

707
00:37:38.461 --> 00:37:43.461
<v Speaker 1>necessarily a good platform for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have all the places that I tend to get</v>

708
00:37:45.001 --> 00:37:45.834
<v Speaker 1>into trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twitter is sort of at the top of the </v>

709
00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:48.264
<v Speaker 1>list now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I laid out in my blog why I still use </v>

710
00:37:50.941 --> 00:37:51.774
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel some moral obligation to the </v>

711
00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.310
<v Speaker 1>almost a million people who follow me on</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter for example.</v>

712
00:37:56.311 --> 00:37:58.380
<v Speaker 1>And there's an addictive quality to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

713
00:37:58.381 --> 00:37:59.214
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm following a lot of these people in </v>

714
00:38:00.691 --> 00:38:03.630
<v Speaker 1>the intellectual dark web and seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're up to and trying to keep an</v>

715
00:38:03.631 --> 00:38:06.540
<v Speaker 1>eye on the cultural climate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

716
00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:10.590
<v Speaker 1>And it's not easy to figure out for me </v>
<v Speaker 1>as it sure is the case for all of you,</v>

717
00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:11.603
<v Speaker 1>exactly how much you should be exposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to such things and how much you should </v>

718
00:38:14.221 --> 00:38:15.060
<v Speaker 1>protect yourself.</v>

719
00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:15.893
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a case could certainly be made that I </v>

720
00:38:17.311 --> 00:38:18.144
<v Speaker 1>should stay the hell off twitter and do </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing but write for the next year </v>

721
00:38:20.251 --> 00:38:22.770
<v Speaker 1>cause it's not like I have any shortage </v>
<v Speaker 1>of things to write about.</v>

722
00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:26.310
<v Speaker 1>So I'm trying to sort that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

723
00:38:26.311 --> 00:38:28.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my explanation.</v>

724
00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:32.400
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it could easily be that,</v>

725
00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:35.333
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could easily be that the idea that I </v>

726
00:38:37.871 --> 00:38:41.680
<v Speaker 1>put forward wasn't the best idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

727
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:44.710
<v Speaker 1>who knows what the best ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the best idea was for cavenaugh to</v>

728
00:38:44.711 --> 00:38:47.650
<v Speaker 1>do exactly what he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows.</v>

729
00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.113
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more,</v>

730
00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:50.043
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good luck to him and to the Supreme </v>

731
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:52.870
<v Speaker 1>Court.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope it all stabilizes.</v>

732
00:38:52.871 --> 00:38:54.940
<v Speaker 1>That would be lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it has happened before.</v>

733
00:38:54.941 --> 00:38:57.220
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe it will again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

734
00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:58.753
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took the understand myself test and </v>

735
00:39:01.871 --> 00:39:02.710
<v Speaker 1>have a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

736
00:39:02.711 --> 00:39:03.544
<v Speaker 1>So the understand myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>tests@understandmyself.com for all of </v>

737
00:39:06.511 --> 00:39:07.344
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those of you who don't know is a </v>

738
00:39:07.871 --> 00:39:08.830
<v Speaker 1>personality test.</v>

739
00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.590
<v Speaker 1>It's based on the big five extroversion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism,</v>

740
00:39:11.591 --> 00:39:13.180
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>

741
00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:14.133
<v Speaker 1>openness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It breaks each of them down into two </v>

742
00:39:15.791 --> 00:39:18.580
<v Speaker 1>fundamental aspects that have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>empirically validated.</v>

743
00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:19.803
<v Speaker 1>And so you can take that test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put a code in the description of this </v>

744
00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:23.811
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

745
00:39:23.811 --> 00:39:27.670
<v Speaker 1>I think the code is October.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can use that code for self authoring</v>

746
00:39:27.671 --> 00:39:31.060
<v Speaker 1>and for understand myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a 20% discount for that.</v>

747
00:39:31.061 --> 00:39:31.894
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to do that only takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 15 minutes to do the understand </v>

748
00:39:34.751 --> 00:39:35.920
<v Speaker 1>myself tasked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

749
00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:36.933
<v Speaker 1>the self authoring program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that requires more effort and you have </v>

750
00:39:39.371 --> 00:39:42.070
<v Speaker 1>to do that over a number of days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can do it badly,</v>

751
00:39:42.071 --> 00:39:44.050
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you need a plan man.</v>

752
00:39:44.051 --> 00:39:47.230
<v Speaker 1>You need to know where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the autobiographical part.</v>

753
00:39:47.231 --> 00:39:49.840
<v Speaker 1>And you need a plan for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's worth it.</v>

754
00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

755
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:54.400
<v Speaker 1>it's not as hard as stumbling through </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life blindly.</v>

756
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:55.833
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took the understand myself test and </v>

757
00:39:58.001 --> 00:40:02.950
<v Speaker 1>have a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should I take the results as is and live</v>

758
00:40:02.951 --> 00:40:06.040
<v Speaker 1>trying to cope with them or can I try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>change them to some degree?</v>

759
00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.010
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the first thing is I would say,</v>

760
00:40:09.011 --> 00:40:09.844
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the results as they are to some </v>

761
00:40:12.521 --> 00:40:13.930
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it depends.</v>

762
00:40:13.931 --> 00:40:17.830
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be careful because if you take</v>

763
00:40:17.831 --> 00:40:20.800
<v Speaker 1>a personality test like this and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed,</v>

764
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.190
<v Speaker 1>so you know the future looks really </v>
<v Speaker 1>bleak to you,</v>

765
00:40:24.191 --> 00:40:26.500
<v Speaker 1>the president looks bleak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look into the past,</v>

766
00:40:26.501 --> 00:40:28.600
<v Speaker 1>almost everything looks negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

767
00:40:28.601 --> 00:40:30.490
<v Speaker 1>you're not taking any pleasure in </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

768
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:33.490
<v Speaker 1>You feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps even worse in the morning,</v>

769
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:34.570
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

770
00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:37.030
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't see any light in your life.</v>

771
00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:40.300
<v Speaker 1>You're very self critical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps you're depressed.</v>

772
00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:41.553
<v Speaker 1>Then if you're depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your personality scores are going to </v>

773
00:40:44.171 --> 00:40:45.190
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

774
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:47.620
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be skewed as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that.</v>

775
00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:48.453
<v Speaker 1>And so they might be more negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the mindset that you have </v>

776
00:40:51.791 --> 00:40:53.860
<v Speaker 1>when you take the test then they truly </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

777
00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:57.610
<v Speaker 1>So I'm assuming with this answer that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not depressed.</v>

778
00:40:58.090 --> 00:40:59.180
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

779
00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:02.740
<v Speaker 1>should I take the results as he is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>live trying to cope with them?</v>

780
00:41:02.741 --> 00:41:03.574
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing is you should at least give </v>

781
00:41:06.101 --> 00:41:10.060
<v Speaker 1>yourself some credit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're a particular way.</v>

782
00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:13.120
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you're low in openness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just for the sake of argument.</v>

783
00:41:13.121 --> 00:41:15.850
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you're low in openness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>moderately high in conscientiousness.</v>

784
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:16.833
<v Speaker 1>You're a more conservative person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're probably going to be happier if </v>

785
00:41:20.321 --> 00:41:22.600
<v Speaker 1>you take a more conservative path in </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

786
00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:23.980
<v Speaker 1>you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

787
00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:26.230
<v Speaker 1>if you're low in openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you not that creative,</v>

788
00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:28.180
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>aesthetics.</v>

789
00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:31.870
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to be interested even </v>
<v Speaker 1>in ideas to that greater degree.</v>

790
00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 1>It's not your area of fascination.</v>

791
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:34.873
<v Speaker 1>You're more practical and concrete and </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps and also less flighty and less </v>

792
00:41:39.471 --> 00:41:41.480
<v Speaker 1>prone to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to create of error.</v>

793
00:41:41.481 --> 00:41:42.980
<v Speaker 1>There's advantages to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

794
00:41:42.981 --> 00:41:45.660
<v Speaker 1>because most creative people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

795
00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:46.663
<v Speaker 1>our fonts of ideas that will work and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will occupy a tremendous amount of </v>

796
00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:54.380
<v Speaker 1>counter productive time in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>implementation.</v>

797
00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:57.260
<v Speaker 1>That's the downside to creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>false positives.</v>

798
00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:59.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're disagreeable,</v>

799
00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.193
<v Speaker 1>well then you're going to try to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere where competent </v>

800
00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:07.010
<v Speaker 1>competitiveness is useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're high in neuroticism,</v>

801
00:42:07.011 --> 00:42:07.844
<v Speaker 1>then you're probably going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find a job where the stress levels </v>

802
00:42:09.981 --> 00:42:11.390
<v Speaker 1>aren't too high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're introverted,</v>

803
00:42:11.391 --> 00:42:12.224
<v Speaker 1>you want to find a place where you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>work and spend a fair bit of time by </v>

804
00:42:14.781 --> 00:42:15.614
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you want to match your </v>

805
00:42:17.691 --> 00:42:21.350
<v Speaker 1>environment to your personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's adaptation to some degree.</v>

806
00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're really high in neuroticism for</v>

807
00:42:24.711 --> 00:42:25.544
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're too anxious and then there </v>

808
00:42:27.531 --> 00:42:30.620
<v Speaker 1>are things that you can do about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that that's something you might</v>

809
00:42:30.621 --> 00:42:31.454
<v Speaker 1>want to.</v>

810
00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:36.050
<v Speaker 1>If it's really out of hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say if you're 98th percentile or above,</v>

811
00:42:36.051 --> 00:42:36.884
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's also making you suffer because </v>

812
00:42:38.511 --> 00:42:41.390
<v Speaker 1>you're too anxious and too risk averse </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to volatile.</v>

813
00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:42.403
<v Speaker 1>You might want to consider something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like counseling to see if you can get </v>

814
00:42:45.771 --> 00:42:46.604
<v Speaker 1>your anxiety levels down or to learn to </v>
<v Speaker 1>meditate or to learn to control your </v>

815
00:42:49.941 --> 00:42:52.070
<v Speaker 1>breathing or or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

816
00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:53.113
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or to talk to someone to see if there's </v>

817
00:42:54.381 --> 00:42:58.730
<v Speaker 1>some physiological reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can change,</v>

818
00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:01.730
<v Speaker 1>but like if you're introverted and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can develop social skills,</v>

819
00:43:01.731 --> 00:43:03.650
<v Speaker 1>but you kind of have to do them one at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

820
00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:04.513
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not something that comes </v>

821
00:43:05.901 --> 00:43:09.080
<v Speaker 1>naturally to you and it might not be </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you developed as a child.</v>

822
00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:12.530
<v Speaker 1>You have to consciously plan a social </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy.</v>

823
00:43:12.531 --> 00:43:13.341
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

824
00:43:13.341 --> 00:43:14.174
<v Speaker 1>I'm introverted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should go out with someone for lunch </v>

825
00:43:16.881 --> 00:43:17.714
<v Speaker 1>once a week.</v>

826
00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:19.940
<v Speaker 1>I should see friends twice a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

827
00:43:19.941 --> 00:43:20.774
<v Speaker 1>You should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to make a plan for social </v>

828
00:43:22.251 --> 00:43:23.084
<v Speaker 1>interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're extroverted and you can't </v>

829
00:43:24.951 --> 00:43:27.290
<v Speaker 1>stand being alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you might practice being alone</v>

830
00:43:27.291 --> 00:43:28.124
<v Speaker 1>a little bit so that you can learn how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to spend some quality time on yourself </v>

831
00:43:31.401 --> 00:43:33.590
<v Speaker 1>and not be so dependent on the company </v>
<v Speaker 1>of others.</v>

832
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:36.560
<v Speaker 1>If you're an agreeable person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too agreeable,</v>

833
00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:40.460
<v Speaker 1>then you'll need to figure out what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you want,</v>

834
00:43:40.461 --> 00:43:41.294
<v Speaker 1>what you're resentful about and what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to negotiate about on your own </v>

835
00:43:44.151 --> 00:43:46.670
<v Speaker 1>behalf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're really disagreeable,</v>

836
00:43:46.671 --> 00:43:51.530
<v Speaker 1>then you might want to think hard about </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciously deciding that once a week or</v>

837
00:43:51.531 --> 00:43:55.280
<v Speaker 1>so you're going to try to do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>for someone else.</v>

838
00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:58.260
<v Speaker 1>And there's a research literature on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that actually a,</v>

839
00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:59.113
<v Speaker 1>it indicates quite clearly that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciously plan to do something </v>

840
00:44:03.411 --> 00:44:04.244
<v Speaker 1>altruistic on a regular basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does seem to improve overall </v>

841
00:44:07.191 --> 00:44:07.790
<v Speaker 1>wellbeing.</v>

842
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:08.623
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>important for disagreeable people </v>

843
00:44:10.491 --> 00:44:14.300
<v Speaker 1>because they don't do that naturally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't come to them naturally.</v>

844
00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:18.100
<v Speaker 1>So I think that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

845
00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:23.120
<v Speaker 1>the general advice is find an </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment where your temperament works</v>

846
00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:26.750
<v Speaker 1>and then the more specific advices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While having said that,</v>

847
00:44:26.751 --> 00:44:29.150
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't hurt to expand your </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperament.</v>

848
00:44:29.151 --> 00:44:29.984
<v Speaker 1>If you're introverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be able to do extroverted </v>

849
00:44:32.011 --> 00:44:33.780
<v Speaker 1>people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're extroverted,</v>

850
00:44:33.781 --> 00:44:36.870
<v Speaker 1>you should be able to spend time alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should develop those as skills.</v>

851
00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:38.123
<v Speaker 1>If you're an agreeable person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should learn how to negotiate for </v>

852
00:44:40.441 --> 00:44:43.830
<v Speaker 1>yourself in a tough minded manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're disagreeable,</v>

853
00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:44.753
<v Speaker 1>you should learn to take other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>into consideration more if you're </v>

854
00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:50.760
<v Speaker 1>unconscientious wouldn't hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To have a schedule,</v>

855
00:44:50.761 --> 00:44:51.594
<v Speaker 1>like a Google calendar and to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>working on that because la low </v>

856
00:44:54.601 --> 00:44:57.750
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness is going to interfere </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your longterm success.</v>

857
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:59.670
<v Speaker 1>And if you're hyper conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

858
00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:04.170
<v Speaker 1>you might need to learn to relax a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit and to make that a priority.</v>

859
00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:06.360
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're high in openness,</v>

860
00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:07.283
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

861
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:11.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a quick answer for what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do if you're high in openness.</v>

862
00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:12.221
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

863
00:45:12.221 --> 00:45:17.221
<v Speaker 1>I guess I do to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to focus on one thing to some degree</v>

864
00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:21.490
<v Speaker 1>on one thing and get good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when you're open,</v>

865
00:45:21.491 --> 00:45:22.324
<v Speaker 1>you're flying out all over the place </v>
<v Speaker 1>latterly and you can easily become a </v>

866
00:45:25.361 --> 00:45:26.194
<v Speaker 1>dilettante's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things you have to do if </v>

867
00:45:27.341 --> 00:45:31.990
<v Speaker 1>you're high in openness is develop true </v>
<v Speaker 1>expertise in at least one place.</v>

868
00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:33.273
<v Speaker 1>You can even pick it somewhat arbitrary </v>
<v Speaker 1>given that you're interested in </v>

869
00:45:35.201 --> 00:45:36.940
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Commit to something.</v>

870
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:38.103
<v Speaker 1>If you're low in openness and the little</v>
<v Speaker 1>closed off compared to what you should </v>

871
00:45:41.201 --> 00:45:42.280
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little narrow minded,</v>

872
00:45:42.281 --> 00:45:43.660
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and conventional.</v>

873
00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you should read a book a week.</v>

874
00:45:47.050 --> 00:45:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Join a book club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing to do.</v>

875
00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:50.143
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

876
00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:52.100
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

877
00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:53.390
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good start.</v>

878
00:45:53.391 --> 00:45:55.270
<v Speaker 1>Join a book club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

879
00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:56.530
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

880
00:45:56.650 --> 00:45:58.700
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and open yourself up a little bit.</v>

881
00:45:58.701 --> 00:46:02.120
<v Speaker 1>Go see a movie now and then as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would also be helpful,</v>

882
00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:03.470
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

883
00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.960
<v Speaker 1>and that will widen you out a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's important.</v>

884
00:46:05.961 --> 00:46:07.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's important for your career and all</v>

885
00:46:07.671 --> 00:46:08.990
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to,</v>

886
00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:10.273
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your temperament to puts you in a </v>

887
00:46:11.451 --> 00:46:12.284
<v Speaker 1>certain place in the distribution and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't so much that you want to move the </v>

888
00:46:15.711 --> 00:46:16.544
<v Speaker 1>place is that you want to move the </v>
<v Speaker 1>variability so that you can be what you </v>

889
00:46:21.441 --> 00:46:23.570
<v Speaker 1>need to be when the situation demands </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

890
00:46:23.571 --> 00:46:25.130
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't mean to blow in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wind.</v>

891
00:46:25.131 --> 00:46:25.964
<v Speaker 1>It means to be adaptable instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>constrained tightly by your biological </v>

892
00:46:28.851 --> 00:46:32.030
<v Speaker 1>predisposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can learn that it's painstaking.</v>

893
00:46:32.031 --> 00:46:33.740
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it requires a lot of effort,</v>

894
00:46:33.741 --> 00:46:35.660
<v Speaker 1>but you can learn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

895
00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:44.380
<v Speaker 1>my daughter's school is now teaching </v>
<v Speaker 1>gender as a social construct for sexes.</v>

896
00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Avoids naming boys and girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did we do?</v>

897
00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Leaving is not an option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

898
00:47:00.971 --> 00:47:03.040
<v Speaker 1>I guess the first question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

899
00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:04.870
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just take you at your word.</v>

900
00:47:04.871 --> 00:47:07.810
<v Speaker 1>That leaving is not an option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It certainly might not be an option.</v>

901
00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:11.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say</v>

902
00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:14.273
<v Speaker 1>your best bet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a casual piece of advice </v>

903
00:47:17.521 --> 00:47:19.650
<v Speaker 1>because I don't know your particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

904
00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:20.933
<v Speaker 1>is to find out how many parents there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are around who are also not happy about </v>

905
00:47:27.241 --> 00:47:31.690
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then start to strategize.</v>

906
00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:33.153
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

907
00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:39.540
<v Speaker 1>to some degree what people define as </v>
<v Speaker 1>gender is a social construct.</v>

908
00:47:39.671 --> 00:47:44.671
<v Speaker 1>So let's look at it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are things that make men,</v>

909
00:47:45.131 --> 00:47:45.964
<v Speaker 1>men and that make women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women that are universal across </v>

910
00:47:48.941 --> 00:47:50.500
<v Speaker 1>cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say,</v>

911
00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:53.890
<v Speaker 1>except for tiny variations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

912
00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:57.940
<v Speaker 1>external genitalia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

913
00:47:58.600 --> 00:47:59.433
<v Speaker 1>but then there are things that do vary </v>
<v Speaker 1>across culture with regards to whether </v>

914
00:48:02.711 --> 00:48:05.230
<v Speaker 1>they're regarded as masculine or </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine,</v>

915
00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:07.480
<v Speaker 1>male or female.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are more learned.</v>

916
00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:11.740
<v Speaker 1>So let's say that external genitalia is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not a social construct.</v>

917
00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:14.230
<v Speaker 1>It's not learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we can't agree on that,</v>

918
00:48:14.231 --> 00:48:16.540
<v Speaker 1>then we're not going to be able to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a discussion at all.</v>

919
00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:17.973
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are some things about male </v>

920
00:48:18.761 --> 00:48:19.594
<v Speaker 1>behavior and some things about female </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior that are culture specific and </v>

921
00:48:22.061 --> 00:48:23.860
<v Speaker 1>learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so to that degree,</v>

922
00:48:23.861 --> 00:48:26.770
<v Speaker 1>gender is a social construct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

923
00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:29.560
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to give the devil his due,</v>

924
00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:31.203
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem isn't teaching that gender </v>

925
00:48:34.241 --> 00:48:35.074
<v Speaker 1>is a social construct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That problem is teaching the gender is </v>

926
00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:40.510
<v Speaker 1>only a social construct and that's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

927
00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:42.940
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as someone's doing that,</v>

928
00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:45.070
<v Speaker 1>then you know that you're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>an idiot log.</v>

929
00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:48.730
<v Speaker 1>And the research evidence on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

930
00:48:48.731 --> 00:48:49.564
<v Speaker 1>is crystal clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apart from the fact that there are </v>

931
00:48:50.771 --> 00:48:53.050
<v Speaker 1>morphological differences between men </v>
<v Speaker 1>and women,</v>

932
00:48:53.051 --> 00:48:55.090
<v Speaker 1>which are quite obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

933
00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:58.510
<v Speaker 1>you can name a variety of the men have </v>
<v Speaker 1>wider jaws,</v>

934
00:48:58.511 --> 00:49:00.700
<v Speaker 1>they have larger teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can bite harder,</v>

935
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:02.223
<v Speaker 1>they have thicker skulls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As women certainly can attest to from a </v>

936
00:49:04.781 --> 00:49:05.614
<v Speaker 1>psychological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are more powerful in the upper </v>

937
00:49:07.961 --> 00:49:08.290
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

938
00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:11.800
<v Speaker 1>They can punch a lot harder there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can throw more naturally.</v>

939
00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:13.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

940
00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:14.830
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

941
00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:16.300
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tend to weigh more,</v>

942
00:49:16.301 --> 00:49:19.090
<v Speaker 1>they tend to be taller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's sexual dimorphism.</v>

943
00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:23.110
<v Speaker 1>Human beings are relatively sexually </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimorphic as far as primates.</v>

944
00:49:23.111 --> 00:49:25.150
<v Speaker 1>And other mammals go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

945
00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:27.040
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's difference in,</v>

946
00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:31.350
<v Speaker 1>in obviously a waist to hip ratio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

947
00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:34.720
<v Speaker 1>women's elbows or a different angle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have finer bones.</v>

948
00:49:34.721 --> 00:49:39.040
<v Speaker 1>Women have a subcutaneous layer of body </v>
<v Speaker 1>fat that men don't have.</v>

949
00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:40.193
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women are a little bit more pain </v>

950
00:49:42.131 --> 00:49:43.290
<v Speaker 1>resistant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

951
00:49:43.570 --> 00:49:45.940
<v Speaker 1>made more pain tolerant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're also,</v>

952
00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:46.803
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also have very high levels of </v>

953
00:49:48.011 --> 00:49:49.540
<v Speaker 1>stamina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

954
00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:52.450
<v Speaker 1>women tend to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a little edge in verbal ability.</v>

955
00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:54.910
<v Speaker 1>Men tend to have a little edge in </v>
<v Speaker 1>spatial ability.</v>

956
00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:56.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there are,</v>

957
00:49:57.010 --> 00:50:00.040
<v Speaker 1>apart from the straight physiological </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences,</v>

958
00:50:00.370 --> 00:50:03.760
<v Speaker 1>there are psychological differences and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a variety of them.</v>

959
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women are more enthusiastic,</v>

960
00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:08.770
<v Speaker 1>men are more assertive.</v>

961
00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:09.693
<v Speaker 1>That's extroversion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women are higher in withdrawal and in </v>

962
00:50:12.251 --> 00:50:14.830
<v Speaker 1>volatility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's on the neuroticism front.</v>

963
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:17.590
<v Speaker 1>Women are more agreeable and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>polite.</v>

964
00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:21.370
<v Speaker 1>That's on the agreeableness front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men are more industrious,</v>

965
00:50:21.371 --> 00:50:24.940
<v Speaker 1>slightly and women are more orderly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's on the conscientious front.</v>

966
00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:30.120
<v Speaker 1>And women are higher in openness proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>and men are higher in interest in ideas.</v>

967
00:50:30.681 --> 00:50:35.300
<v Speaker 1>And that's on the openness front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those differences aren't huge.</v>

968
00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:37.490
<v Speaker 1>There's more overlap between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>genders,</v>

969
00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:40.580
<v Speaker 1>the sexist than there are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there is lack of overlap,</v>

970
00:50:40.581 --> 00:50:45.581
<v Speaker 1>but the differences magnify at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremes and they also um,</v>

971
00:50:46.070 --> 00:50:49.220
<v Speaker 1>maximize in societies that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>egalitarian.</v>

972
00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:50.323
<v Speaker 1>And then the biggest difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>men and women that we know of </v>

973
00:50:52.041 --> 00:50:52.874
<v Speaker 1>psychologically is that men are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>prone to be interested in things and </v>

974
00:50:56.421 --> 00:50:58.580
<v Speaker 1>women are more prone to be interested in</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

975
00:50:58.581 --> 00:50:59.414
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually quite a large </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference by psychological standards </v>

976
00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:05.930
<v Speaker 1>and there isn't any evidence that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is socially constructed.</v>

977
00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:09.800
<v Speaker 1>The counter evidence is that as you make</v>
<v Speaker 1>society's more egalitarian,</v>

978
00:51:09.801 --> 00:51:12.200
<v Speaker 1>those differences actually get bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than smaller.</v>

979
00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:13.183
<v Speaker 1>And even the London Times three weeks </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago wrote an editorial describing and </v>

980
00:51:16.481 --> 00:51:18.770
<v Speaker 1>not yet another study that demonstrated </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

981
00:51:18.771 --> 00:51:19.604
<v Speaker 1>So that's like six and they're huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge scale studies pointing out that </v>

982
00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:24.393
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the differences between </v>

983
00:51:25.971 --> 00:51:26.804
<v Speaker 1>men and women get bigger in more </v>
<v Speaker 1>egalitarian societies is now one of the </v>

984
00:51:29.331 --> 00:51:33.200
<v Speaker 1>most well established findings in all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the social sciences.</v>

985
00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:35.360
<v Speaker 1>Thus demonstrating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

986
00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:36.283
<v Speaker 1>that poor James Damore was correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that Google fired him </v>

987
00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:45.290
<v Speaker 1>for being accurate in his analysis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the scientific literature.</v>

988
00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:48.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got the facts on your side.</v>

989
00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:49.333
<v Speaker 1>Problem is is you don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's only one of you that's not </v>

990
00:51:52.131 --> 00:51:54.080
<v Speaker 1>a good number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to mount a campaign,</v>

991
00:51:54.350 --> 00:51:55.183
<v Speaker 1>you annoyed about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well write down exactly what you're </v>

992
00:51:58.761 --> 00:51:59.594
<v Speaker 1>annoyed about.</v>

993
00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:01.970
<v Speaker 1>What bothers you about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

994
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:03.343
<v Speaker 1>what would you like to have happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you need to know what the </v>

995
00:52:06.591 --> 00:52:09.080
<v Speaker 1>problem is and you need to know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>this solution is.</v>

996
00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:10.153
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to start thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy and one strategy is you need </v>

997
00:52:13.911 --> 00:52:16.040
<v Speaker 1>some allies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need some people on your side.</v>

998
00:52:16.041 --> 00:52:20.450
<v Speaker 1>Now if this is bothering you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that it's bothering most</v>

999
00:52:20.451 --> 00:52:23.120
<v Speaker 1>people is very high because it's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>rare,</v>

1000
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:26.750
<v Speaker 1>especially with something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would say,</v>

1001
00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:32.780
<v Speaker 1>and I think the data's support this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the overwhelming majority of people</v>

1002
00:52:32.781 --> 00:52:36.020
<v Speaker 1>do not believe that gender is a social </v>
<v Speaker 1>construct construct.</v>

1003
00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:40.490
<v Speaker 1>That there are four sexes and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>avoiding naming boys and girls is a good</v>

1004
00:52:40.491 --> 00:52:42.020
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got,</v>

1005
00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:44.390
<v Speaker 1>unless you're in a very progressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

1006
00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:45.493
<v Speaker 1>in which case that's it's own problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got to find some people who would be </v>

1007
00:52:50.241 --> 00:52:51.650
<v Speaker 1>willing to go to bat with you.</v>

1008
00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:55.010
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to find it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>political struggle.</v>

1009
00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:56.390
<v Speaker 1>It's a bit of a war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1010
00:52:56.391 --> 00:52:57.920
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's pushing this?</v>

1011
00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:00.920
<v Speaker 1>Who's the ring leaders for this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1012
00:53:00.921 --> 00:53:02.750
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly possible that most of the</v>

1013
00:53:02.751 --> 00:53:06.260
<v Speaker 1>teachers don't want to do this either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're afraid to say anything.</v>

1014
00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:07.453
<v Speaker 1>So I would say there's probably a two </v>
<v Speaker 1>year campaign and you have to decide if </v>

1015
00:53:11.661 --> 00:53:14.090
<v Speaker 1>this is something that you want to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>your time and effort into.</v>

1016
00:53:14.091 --> 00:53:15.920
<v Speaker 1>And if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to conduct it like a,</v>

1017
00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:17.810
<v Speaker 1>like a war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1018
00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:19.720
<v Speaker 1>without the violence obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it,</v>

1019
00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:23.870
<v Speaker 1>but that's the right metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what's the set of problems?</v>

1020
00:53:24.590 --> 00:53:25.423
<v Speaker 1>Who's causing them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to have happen as a </v>

1021
00:53:27.511 --> 00:53:28.830
<v Speaker 1>concept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an alternative?</v>

1022
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:31.680
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to tackle this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to talk to your,</v>

1023
00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:34.740
<v Speaker 1>to your local public authorities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>school authorities.</v>

1024
00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:37.650
<v Speaker 1>You're going to talk to the local </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians in to talk to the principal.</v>

1025
00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:38.713
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to face down the teachers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to do that with more than </v>

1026
00:53:40.861 --> 00:53:41.694
<v Speaker 1>one of you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to have your arguments in </v>

1027
00:53:42.721 --> 00:53:43.980
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1028
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.230
<v Speaker 1>art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then on a more personal front,</v>

1029
00:53:46.231 --> 00:53:49.080
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter?</v>

1030
00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:50.063
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to educate her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you decide not to take this </v>

1031
00:53:52.141 --> 00:53:54.090
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the political or public front,</v>

1032
00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:58.230
<v Speaker 1>then you have to have a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>with her and find out what she thinks,</v>

1033
00:53:58.231 --> 00:53:59.064
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because she'll be doubtful and dubious </v>

1034
00:54:00.481 --> 00:54:01.314
<v Speaker 1>about all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of that should be asking her </v>

1035
00:54:03.241 --> 00:54:04.950
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1036
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:08.520
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the best I can do with that.</v>

1037
00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Would you consider adding a list of </v>
<v Speaker 1>recommended movies to your website?</v>

1038
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:17.760
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've thought about that.</v>

1039
00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Also a recommended list of books for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for young people.</v>

1040
00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:22.403
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's on the hypothetical list of things </v>

1041
00:54:24.871 --> 00:54:26.190
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1042
00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:29.190
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't done it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1043
00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:31.843
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that it's likely to make </v>

1044
00:54:33.451 --> 00:54:34.284
<v Speaker 1>it up the priority list for awhile </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm pretty booked out for the </v>

1045
00:54:36.661 --> 00:54:39.870
<v Speaker 1>next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows how long a while.</v>

1046
00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:41.243
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot understand myself or other big </v>

1047
00:54:43.261 --> 00:54:45.690
<v Speaker 1>five test be taken after some time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eg,</v>

1048
00:54:45.691 --> 00:54:46.524
<v Speaker 1>one to two years and be fairly accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked because I believe I have </v>

1049
00:54:49.021 --> 00:54:49.741
<v Speaker 1>changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1050
00:54:49.741 --> 00:54:50.910
<v Speaker 1>you might've changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1051
00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:52.530
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1052
00:54:52.531 --> 00:54:53.364
<v Speaker 1>people do change as they mature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Personality is relatively stable across </v>

1053
00:54:57.661 --> 00:54:58.494
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but relatively stable doesn't mean </v>

1054
00:54:59.881 --> 00:55:02.190
<v Speaker 1>completely stable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that,</v>

1055
00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:04.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were extremely extroverted,</v>

1056
00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:09.390
<v Speaker 1>the probability that in five years </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be extremely introverted</v>

1057
00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:13.620
<v Speaker 1>is very low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you were extremely extroverted,</v>

1058
00:55:13.830 --> 00:55:14.663
<v Speaker 1>it's conceivable that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in one or two years you'll be a </v>

1059
00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:21.390
<v Speaker 1>moderately extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can move.</v>

1060
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:25.230
<v Speaker 1>And some of that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of that's situational.</v>

1061
00:55:25.450 --> 00:55:26.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of it's learning,</v>

1062
00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:27.983
<v Speaker 1>some of it's maturation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the most reliable findings in </v>

1063
00:55:31.141 --> 00:55:33.960
<v Speaker 1>the personality literature is that as </v>
<v Speaker 1>people get older,</v>

1064
00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:38.220
<v Speaker 1>they get more conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more agreeable,</v>

1065
00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:41.340
<v Speaker 1>and more emotionally stable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less neurotic.</v>

1066
00:55:41.341 --> 00:55:45.210
<v Speaker 1>And that those three traits clump to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a super trade called,</v>

1067
00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:46.253
<v Speaker 1>we called it stability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people get more stable as they get </v>

1068
00:55:48.781 --> 00:55:49.860
<v Speaker 1>older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1069
00:55:49.861 --> 00:55:52.710
<v Speaker 1>and I've seen people learn to be more </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious,</v>

1070
00:55:52.711 --> 00:55:55.140
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happens.</v>

1071
00:55:55.141 --> 00:55:57.090
<v Speaker 1>I think whenever you take people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

1072
00:55:57.450 --> 00:55:58.283
<v Speaker 1>who are young and sort of flighty and </v>
<v Speaker 1>put them through a rigorous </v>

1073
00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:03.750
<v Speaker 1>apprenticeship program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1074
00:56:03.751 --> 00:56:04.584
<v Speaker 1>where they disciplined themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen people become certainly </v>

1075
00:56:07.441 --> 00:56:12.441
<v Speaker 1>become less lower in neuroticism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>less agreeable for that matter.</v>

1076
00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:14.610
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yes,</v>

1077
00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:15.930
<v Speaker 1>you can take them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1078
00:56:16.050 --> 00:56:18.990
<v Speaker 1>Take it again two years later and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1079
00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:20.010
<v Speaker 1>and see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1080
00:56:20.011 --> 00:56:22.950
<v Speaker 1>the other thing you can do if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>really curious about your personality is</v>

1081
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:27.310
<v Speaker 1>have some other people take the </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality test about you.</v>

1082
00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:31.690
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know some things about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality and they're accurate to some</v>

1083
00:56:31.691 --> 00:56:34.240
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Self report has some degree of accuracy,</v>

1084
00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:37.930
<v Speaker 1>but then you can get information from </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people as well.</v>

1085
00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:39.700
<v Speaker 1>And so that's another way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>determining,</v>

1086
00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:41.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1087
00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:44.530
<v Speaker 1>if a helping of helping get an accurate </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture of who you are.</v>

1088
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:45.870
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1089
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:50.560
<v Speaker 1>you can change drum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more dramatic the change,</v>

1090
00:56:50.561 --> 00:56:53.890
<v Speaker 1>the more effort is required.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way of thinking about it.</v>

1091
00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:55.180
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1092
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:56.650
<v Speaker 1>we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1093
00:56:56.651 --> 00:57:00.070
<v Speaker 1>that you can change Iq with shift in </v>
<v Speaker 1>socioeconomic status.</v>

1094
00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:04.410
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that you have identical twins</v>
<v Speaker 1>separated at birth and you know,</v>

1095
00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:05.253
<v Speaker 1>you put one twin into a relatively well </v>
<v Speaker 1>off family and one twin into a </v>

1096
00:57:08.291 --> 00:57:09.124
<v Speaker 1>relatively poor family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And let's assume that being rich has </v>

1097
00:57:11.261 --> 00:57:14.110
<v Speaker 1>some advantages with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual development.</v>

1098
00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:17.020
<v Speaker 1>You need a three standard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

1099
00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:20.140
<v Speaker 1>you need a three standard deviation </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be four,</v>

1100
00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:21.003
<v Speaker 1>but you need a three or four standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>deviation move upward in socioeconomic </v>

1101
00:57:25.601 --> 00:57:29.620
<v Speaker 1>status to produce a one standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>deviation increase in Iq.</v>

1102
00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:33.220
<v Speaker 1>So you have to move from something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fifth percentile.</v>

1103
00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:34.563
<v Speaker 1>I might have the stats a bit wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm trying to do this on the </v>

1104
00:57:37.361 --> 00:57:38.194
<v Speaker 1>fly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to move from the bottom fifth </v>

1105
00:57:40.211 --> 00:57:41.044
<v Speaker 1>percentile to the top fifth percentile </v>
<v Speaker 1>in wealth to move from average </v>

1106
00:57:46.451 --> 00:57:49.840
<v Speaker 1>intelligence to 85th percentile in </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

1107
00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:53.770
<v Speaker 1>So you can change as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the situation,</v>

1108
00:57:53.771 --> 00:57:57.940
<v Speaker 1>but the bigger the change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more costly and that could be costly</v>

1109
00:57:57.941 --> 00:58:00.370
<v Speaker 1>in terms of resources or effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1110
00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:04.780
<v Speaker 1>when you like doing a podcast with Elon </v>
<v Speaker 1>Musk,</v>

1111
00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:07.510
<v Speaker 1>let's start an initiative for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1112
00:58:07.511 --> 00:58:09.940
<v Speaker 1>I would like to do a podcast with Elon </v>
<v Speaker 1>Musk.</v>

1113
00:58:09.941 --> 00:58:11.810
<v Speaker 1>I know people who know him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1114
00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:13.540
<v Speaker 1>but we've never met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1115
00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:15.850
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that would be ridiculously fun.</v>

1116
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.340
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to start an initiative </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that,</v>

1117
00:58:18.341 --> 00:58:19.900
<v Speaker 1>you go right ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who knows,</v>

1118
00:58:19.901 --> 00:58:21.240
<v Speaker 1>maybe it'll bear fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1119
00:58:21.550 --> 00:58:26.470
<v Speaker 1>I am going to be concentrating more on </v>
<v Speaker 1>my podcast in a few months.</v>

1120
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:30.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm contracting with a professional </v>
<v Speaker 1>company to develop it so that it,</v>

1121
00:58:30.850 --> 00:58:34.480
<v Speaker 1>well for a variety of reasons so that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>moves higher up on the priority list.</v>

1122
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:36.610
<v Speaker 1>So I have a better studio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1123
00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:39.860
<v Speaker 1>so that I have some staff to help me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1124
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:42.610
<v Speaker 1>schedule interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of people I want to talk to</v>

1125
00:58:42.611 --> 00:58:44.950
<v Speaker 1>authors and scientists and politicians </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1126
00:58:45.370 --> 00:58:48.130
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I'm quite excited about that.</v>

1127
00:58:48.131 --> 00:58:48.970
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1128
00:58:48.971 --> 00:58:51.190
<v Speaker 1>and I would love to talk to Elon Musk's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1129
00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:53.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that would be ridiculously fun.</v>

1130
00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:56.560
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to find out.</v>

1131
00:58:57.820 --> 00:59:00.520
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to ask him about his thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

1132
00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:01.503
<v Speaker 1>And also I'm really curious about how in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world he manages to do multiple </v>

1133
00:59:05.651 --> 00:59:09.400
<v Speaker 1>impossible things because doing one </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible thing is impossible,</v>

1134
00:59:09.401 --> 00:59:14.401
<v Speaker 1>but doing like five impossible things is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the product of five impossibilities.</v>

1135
00:59:14.891 --> 00:59:17.020
<v Speaker 1>And that just seems like hyper </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible.</v>

1136
00:59:17.350 --> 00:59:18.730
<v Speaker 1>But he's managed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1137
00:59:18.731 --> 00:59:19.511
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>

1138
00:59:19.511 --> 00:59:21.500
<v Speaker 1>Think about what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He built an electric car,</v>

1139
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:22.993
<v Speaker 1>which is like hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he built a rocket and then he </v>

1140
00:59:25.791 --> 00:59:29.510
<v Speaker 1>blasted the car into space on his rocket</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1141
00:59:30.590 --> 00:59:32.420
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not real.</v>

1142
00:59:32.421 --> 00:59:35.960
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it did happen and he did it.</v>

1143
00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:38.930
<v Speaker 1>And so I would really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to talk to him.</v>

1144
00:59:38.931 --> 00:59:42.230
<v Speaker 1>I think that would be extremely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely interesting.</v>

1145
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:45.380
<v Speaker 1>How do you fight a monster without </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming one yourself?</v>

1146
00:59:46.310 --> 00:59:47.143
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>

1147
00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:52.760
<v Speaker 1>You become a monster by fighting with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>monster,</v>

1148
00:59:52.761 --> 00:59:55.580
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually a good thing to become</v>
<v Speaker 1>a monster.</v>

1149
00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:56.653
<v Speaker 1>You see the differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and really this is the answer to your </v>

1150
00:59:58.881 --> 01:00:03.881
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could stay naive and that's not good</v>

1151
01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:09.110
<v Speaker 1>because you're vulnerable and you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>useful if you're naive.</v>

1152
01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:13.040
<v Speaker 1>So that's a bad situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say,</v>

1153
01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:13.903
<v Speaker 1>well instead of being naive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you decide you're going to go confront </v>

1154
01:00:15.921 --> 01:00:16.820
<v Speaker 1>the monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1155
01:00:16.821 --> 01:00:21.710
<v Speaker 1>well the problem with that is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>become the monster.</v>

1156
01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.480
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how do you deal with that?</v>

1157
01:00:23.481 --> 01:00:27.290
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is to do it voluntarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it voluntarily.</v>

1158
01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:32.270
<v Speaker 1>Because if you develop your </v>
<v Speaker 1>monstrousness voluntarily,</v>

1159
01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:36.440
<v Speaker 1>then perhaps you can bring it under </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilized control,</v>

1160
01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:39.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can integrate those,</v>

1161
01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:41.250
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

1162
01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:42.173
<v Speaker 1>that capacity for May hem and </v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction that you develop within </v>

1163
01:00:45.691 --> 01:00:46.524
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can integrate that within a </v>

1164
01:00:48.810 --> 01:00:53.280
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive and properly directed </v>
<v Speaker 1>practical philosophy.</v>

1165
01:00:53.970 --> 01:00:55.980
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplined,</v>

1166
01:00:56.250 --> 01:00:58.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a warrior isn't a monster,</v>

1167
01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:03.990
<v Speaker 1>so you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to align,</v>

1168
01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:04.853
<v Speaker 1>you have to discipline your monstrosity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you do that by developing it </v>

1169
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.140
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1170
01:01:10.141 --> 01:01:13.410
<v Speaker 1>you see this sort of thing happening all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time in classic hero stories.</v>

1171
01:01:13.411 --> 01:01:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at the story of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hobbit,</v>

1172
01:01:15.331 --> 01:01:17.130
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1173
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:19.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bilbo,</v>

1174
01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:21.990
<v Speaker 1>I think Bilbo is the harbor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1175
01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Photos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next one.</v>

1176
01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Let me just look that up.</v>

1177
01:01:31.650 --> 01:01:32.041
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1178
01:01:32.041 --> 01:01:33.540
<v Speaker 1>It's Bilbo good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I thought.</v>

1179
01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Now Bill Bolt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he starts,</v>

1180
01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:38.393
<v Speaker 1>when this Harvard starts the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bilbo lives in this little protected </v>

1181
01:01:42.511 --> 01:01:43.650
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

1182
01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:46.050
<v Speaker 1>it's like the castle that the Buddha </v>
<v Speaker 1>grows up in.</v>

1183
01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:47.783
<v Speaker 1>All the bad things are outside of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that actually is </v>

1184
01:01:50.611 --> 01:01:54.690
<v Speaker 1>because of the kingdom is guarded by </v>
<v Speaker 1>these descendants of great kings.</v>

1185
01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:55.553
<v Speaker 1>The striders who the hobbits have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>contempt for cause they kind of look </v>

1186
01:01:58.261 --> 01:02:00.180
<v Speaker 1>like tramps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aragorn is one of them.</v>

1187
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:05.390
<v Speaker 1>So the descendants of great kings patrol</v>
<v Speaker 1>the borders and keep the naive and habit</v>

1188
01:02:05.621 --> 01:02:06.454
<v Speaker 1>and some of the shyer safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are naive and they go about </v>

1189
01:02:08.671 --> 01:02:10.570
<v Speaker 1>their day to day work and nothing really</v>
<v Speaker 1>threatened them.</v>

1190
01:02:10.571 --> 01:02:11.404
<v Speaker 1>And there's no monsters around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because they don't have any real </v>

1191
01:02:13.291 --> 01:02:16.980
<v Speaker 1>challenges and because they're peaceful </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their wealth and security,</v>

1192
01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:18.960
<v Speaker 1>they think they're good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>

1193
01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:22.710
<v Speaker 1>they're just naive and undisciplined and</v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively weak.</v>

1194
01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.080
<v Speaker 1>And so they're not prepared for </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

1195
01:02:26.130 --> 01:02:27.750
<v Speaker 1>When all hell breaks loose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

1196
01:02:27.751 --> 01:02:28.650
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

1197
01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:30.600
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like bait.</v>

1198
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:32.100
<v Speaker 1>They're like prey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1199
01:02:32.101 --> 01:02:33.930
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course the wizard,</v>

1200
01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.113
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gandalf knows this now despite the fact </v>

1201
01:02:38.251 --> 01:02:43.251
<v Speaker 1>that the sugar folk are rather small and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit comical and tremendously naive.</v>

1202
01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:46.710
<v Speaker 1>They do have a latent ability for </v>
<v Speaker 1>courage and,</v>

1203
01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:47.603
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and forthrightness and Gandalf can </v>

1204
01:02:49.531 --> 01:02:51.420
<v Speaker 1>really see this in the one hobbit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bilbo.</v>

1205
01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:56.690
<v Speaker 1>And so he tells Bilbo that darkness is </v>
<v Speaker 1>brewing on the outs and the,</v>

1206
01:02:57.330 --> 01:03:00.570
<v Speaker 1>in the outlands outside of protected </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

1207
01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:03.210
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely classic mythological </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

1208
01:03:03.211 --> 01:03:05.820
<v Speaker 1>It's the same in the lion king where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1209
01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:06.873
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mustafa tells Simba that his kingdom is </v>

1210
01:03:08.911 --> 01:03:12.450
<v Speaker 1>everything that the light falls on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's not to journey outside of that</v>

1211
01:03:12.451 --> 01:03:13.171
<v Speaker 1>domain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1212
01:03:13.171 --> 01:03:15.840
<v Speaker 1>That's how the elephant graveyard in </v>
<v Speaker 1>death and all of that,</v>

1213
01:03:15.841 --> 01:03:19.170
<v Speaker 1>that's outside of the Shyer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say it's outside of Paradise.</v>

1214
01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:20.003
<v Speaker 1>It's outside of the walled city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's outside of your domain of </v>

1215
01:03:22.501 --> 01:03:24.210
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1216
01:03:24.211 --> 01:03:26.430
<v Speaker 1>that's where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where,</v>

1217
01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:30.660
<v Speaker 1>that's where malevolence and chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bruce.</v>

1218
01:03:30.661 --> 01:03:31.494
<v Speaker 1>Now you see that again in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the lion king because that's where </v>

1219
01:03:33.241 --> 01:03:34.074
<v Speaker 1>scar and the hyenas go off to to </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspire and turn into what are </v>

1220
01:03:38.131 --> 01:03:41.420
<v Speaker 1>essentially Jack booted Nazis before </v>
<v Speaker 1>they take over the,</v>

1221
01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.530
<v Speaker 1>the pride land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same idea.</v>

1222
01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:44.911
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1223
01:03:44.911 --> 01:03:49.590
<v Speaker 1>so what happens to bill bolt when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes off to confront the dragon?</v>

1224
01:03:51.450 --> 01:03:53.340
<v Speaker 1>He has to become a thief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1225
01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:55.530
<v Speaker 1>Which is very picky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

1226
01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:57.593
<v Speaker 1>it's very strange ethically because </v>
<v Speaker 1>while bill bill wasn't a thief and you </v>

1227
01:04:00.211 --> 01:04:00.511
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1228
01:04:00.511 --> 01:04:03.690
<v Speaker 1>it's better to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to not be a thief than to be a thief.</v>

1229
01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:07.140
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard answer,</v>

1230
01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.033
<v Speaker 1>very complicated answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not one to be dealt with </v>

1231
01:04:10.921 --> 01:04:15.921
<v Speaker 1>lightly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

1232
01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:22.390
<v Speaker 1>it's not good to be moral if the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>that your moral is because you cannot be</v>

1233
01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:24.910
<v Speaker 1>otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the naivety issue,</v>

1234
01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:26.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So naive,</v>

1235
01:04:26.341 --> 01:04:27.174
<v Speaker 1>it is not morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're terrified to be a thief </v>

1236
01:04:30.521 --> 01:04:33.910
<v Speaker 1>and you have no skill at it and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not a thief,</v>

1237
01:04:34.090 --> 01:04:35.830
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean you're good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1238
01:04:35.831 --> 01:04:37.690
<v Speaker 1>if you could be the best thief in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

1239
01:04:37.691 --> 01:04:39.850
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were one sneaky character and,</v>

1240
01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:40.773
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fast on your feet and a real </v>

1241
01:04:42.311 --> 01:04:45.520
<v Speaker 1>strategic thinker and capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking rules when necessary,</v>

1242
01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:46.673
<v Speaker 1>and scaling walls and climbing houses </v>
<v Speaker 1>and infiltrating parties and plotting </v>

1243
01:04:50.291 --> 01:04:53.320
<v Speaker 1>for the long run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you decided not to do it,</v>

1244
01:04:53.350 --> 01:04:55.600
<v Speaker 1>well then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's a whole different story.</v>

1245
01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:57.610
<v Speaker 1>Then you're a moral animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1246
01:04:57.611 --> 01:05:00.730
<v Speaker 1>So you need that capacity for </v>
<v Speaker 1>criminality.</v>

1247
01:05:01.210 --> 01:05:04.180
<v Speaker 1>You need the capacity for criminality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need the capacity of evil,</v>

1248
01:05:04.181 --> 01:05:07.330
<v Speaker 1>and you need to have mastered that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what makes you good.</v>

1249
01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:09.003
<v Speaker 1>And so while that's what happens in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>harbor is that Bilbo has to develop his </v>

1250
01:05:11.921 --> 01:05:13.270
<v Speaker 1>dark side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his shadow,</v>

1251
01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:15.430
<v Speaker 1>and he does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1252
01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:16.330
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1253
01:05:16.330 --> 01:05:17.163
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1254
01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:20.140
<v Speaker 1>he's a thief and a variety of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He ends up stealing the ring,</v>

1255
01:05:20.141 --> 01:05:20.974
<v Speaker 1>which is really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course that that bleeds into the </v>

1256
01:05:23.831 --> 01:05:25.420
<v Speaker 1>Lord of the rings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1257
01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:26.254
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1258
01:05:26.350 --> 01:05:26.991
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

1259
01:05:26.991 --> 01:05:27.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the look,</v>

1260
01:05:27.731 --> 01:05:29.140
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't get away Scot free</v>

1261
01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:30.853
<v Speaker 1>from developing his dark side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's touched by evil from then on </v>

1262
01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:35.600
<v Speaker 1>and he's got the ring problem and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big one,</v>

1263
01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:38.360
<v Speaker 1>that thing that might possess him </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's got too close to it.</v>

1264
01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:39.313
<v Speaker 1>It's like Harry Potter partner in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>scar and the fact that he has a bit of </v>

1265
01:05:41.711 --> 01:05:42.544
<v Speaker 1>voldemort hit them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the same idea or the </v>

1266
01:05:44.481 --> 01:05:48.450
<v Speaker 1>strange affinity that the joker insists </v>
<v Speaker 1>upon in joker and Batman.</v>

1267
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:51.830
<v Speaker 1>MMM MMM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

1268
01:05:51.950 --> 01:05:52.783
<v Speaker 1>when bill bill comes back to the Shire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's never one of the hobbits </v>

1269
01:05:55.491 --> 01:05:57.410
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's always an outsider.</v>

1270
01:05:57.411 --> 01:06:01.670
<v Speaker 1>He's got a glimmer of magic and danger </v>
<v Speaker 1>about them and that makes people respect</v>

1271
01:06:01.671 --> 01:06:02.504
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they also,</v>

1272
01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:07.400
<v Speaker 1>they also think that he's unconventional</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an unacceptable way and you know,</v>

1273
01:06:07.401 --> 01:06:11.750
<v Speaker 1>kind of make a wide berth around him </v>
<v Speaker 1>because now he's contaminated with,</v>

1274
01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:12.953
<v Speaker 1>with evil and the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though that makes them a much </v>

1275
01:06:14.991 --> 01:06:18.230
<v Speaker 1>better character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all things considered and a real fighter</v>

1276
01:06:18.231 --> 01:06:19.064
<v Speaker 1>in the battle between good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the person who's gone out and </v>

1277
01:06:21.081 --> 01:06:23.180
<v Speaker 1>confronted the dragon and got the </v>
<v Speaker 1>treasure,</v>

1278
01:06:23.181 --> 01:06:25.940
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So well,</v>

1279
01:06:25.941 --> 01:06:26.774
<v Speaker 1>the pathway to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from naivety to the full development of </v>

1280
01:06:28.761 --> 01:06:29.594
<v Speaker 1>character is associated with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>development in the union sense of the </v>

1281
01:06:33.171 --> 01:06:34.004
<v Speaker 1>shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's that capacity for mayhem and </v>

1282
01:06:35.511 --> 01:06:37.700
<v Speaker 1>malevolence that needs to be brought </v>
<v Speaker 1>under control.</v>

1283
01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:40.660
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1284
01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:41.750
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1285
01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:44.310
<v Speaker 1>it's complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1286
01:06:44.690 --> 01:06:45.523
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that doesn't mean that you're </v>

1287
01:06:47.181 --> 01:06:48.014
<v Speaker 1>justified in going out and breaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules because you think that you're </v>

1288
01:06:49.911 --> 01:06:51.410
<v Speaker 1>building your character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1289
01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.350
<v Speaker 1>it's not that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look out,</v>

1290
01:06:53.770 --> 01:06:54.603
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1291
01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:59.220
<v Speaker 1>if you look at stories like Harry </v>
<v Speaker 1>Potter,</v>

1292
01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:01.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of Harry's crew breaks rules,</v>

1293
01:07:01.830 --> 01:07:05.910
<v Speaker 1>but they only break a rule when not </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking.</v>

1294
01:07:05.911 --> 01:07:10.140
<v Speaker 1>It would break a higher order rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's still morally ambivalent,</v>

1295
01:07:10.141 --> 01:07:10.974
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the best pathway forward is to </v>

1296
01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.113
<v Speaker 1>violate no conventions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do the right thing and violate new </v>

1297
01:07:17.731 --> 01:07:18.750
<v Speaker 1>conventions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1298
01:07:18.810 --> 01:07:19.643
<v Speaker 1>no conventions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now and then you're in a terrible </v>

1299
01:07:21.571 --> 01:07:22.404
<v Speaker 1>situation where you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do a small bad thing or a large </v>

1300
01:07:26.581 --> 01:07:31.020
<v Speaker 1>bad thing or you can allow a large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad thing to happen by,</v>

1301
01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:34.050
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by not,</v>

1302
01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:35.503
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by failing to break a rule that often </v>

1303
01:07:37.111 --> 01:07:40.140
<v Speaker 1>happens in Harry Potter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you're in trouble.</v>

1304
01:07:40.141 --> 01:07:40.974
<v Speaker 1>And part of being wise and oriented </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the good is to know when </v>

1305
01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:46.470
<v Speaker 1>breaking a rule is the right thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

1306
01:07:46.471 --> 01:07:48.990
<v Speaker 1>even though you shouldn't break rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1307
01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:51.823
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1308
01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:55.910
<v Speaker 1>Canada has legalized marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are your thoughts?</v>

1309
01:08:00.090 --> 01:08:01.830
<v Speaker 1>It's about time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my thoughts.</v>

1310
01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:06.450
<v Speaker 1>I think that once a certain number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people break a law,</v>

1311
01:08:07.230 --> 01:08:10.530
<v Speaker 1>then it's not reasonable to have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>law.</v>

1312
01:08:11.070 --> 01:08:12.780
<v Speaker 1>That's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1313
01:08:12.990 --> 01:08:13.823
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious to me that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was irrational in some sense to have </v>

1314
01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:23.443
<v Speaker 1>for marijuana to be illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially given that alcohol is legal </v>

1315
01:08:25.851 --> 01:08:28.070
<v Speaker 1>because all calls way more dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>than marijuana.</v>

1316
01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:31.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm more or less libertarian on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>front.</v>

1317
01:08:31.070 --> 01:08:31.903
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke your damn part and try not to act </v>

1318
01:08:35.211 --> 01:08:37.190
<v Speaker 1>like too much of a moron when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>stoned.</v>

1319
01:08:37.250 --> 01:08:39.950
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1320
01:08:39.951 --> 01:08:40.784
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I kind of feel that way across the </v>

1321
01:08:42.291 --> 01:08:45.050
<v Speaker 1>spectrum of consciousness altering </v>
<v Speaker 1>substances.</v>

1322
01:08:45.051 --> 01:08:46.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ew,</v>

1323
01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:47.783
<v Speaker 1>ew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the danger of restricting </v>

1324
01:08:51.111 --> 01:08:51.944
<v Speaker 1>people's freedoms unnecessarily is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous than the danger of not </v>

1325
01:08:56.691 --> 01:08:57.524
<v Speaker 1>restricting them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're entitled to go to hell in </v>

1326
01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:01.910
<v Speaker 1>a handbasket in your own manner.</v>

1327
01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:04.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hopefully,</v>

1328
01:09:04.670 --> 01:09:05.503
<v Speaker 1>but I do think that if you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>engage or indulge in your favorite drug </v>

1329
01:09:10.161 --> 01:09:10.994
<v Speaker 1>of abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you should be as little amount of </v>

1330
01:09:13.191 --> 01:09:17.180
<v Speaker 1>annoying to everyone around you as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly can be.</v>

1331
01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Then I would also say with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug trade in general,</v>

1332
01:09:21.411 --> 01:09:26.411
<v Speaker 1>is that here's a bunch of consequences </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the war on drugs.</v>

1333
01:09:27.010 --> 01:09:28.850
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the unexpected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1334
01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:31.700
<v Speaker 1>terrible incarceration rates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the United States,</v>

1335
01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:33.043
<v Speaker 1>that's not so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second is the dumping of hundreds of </v>

1336
01:09:37.190 --> 01:09:38.023
<v Speaker 1>millions or billions of dollars into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands of like serious criminals and the </v>

1337
01:09:39.531 --> 01:09:42.680
<v Speaker 1>destabilization of much of Central </v>
<v Speaker 1>America as a consequence,</v>

1338
01:09:42.770 --> 01:09:46.580
<v Speaker 1>tremendous violence as a consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the enriching of people who are</v>

1339
01:09:46.790 --> 01:09:50.990
<v Speaker 1>these are seriously committed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous criminals.</v>

1340
01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.390
<v Speaker 1>And to give them that much power is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad idea.</v>

1341
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.823
<v Speaker 1>So maybe the government has to tax and </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulate like it does with cigarettes </v>

1342
01:09:58.221 --> 01:10:00.980
<v Speaker 1>and it does with alcohol and to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree it does with gambling.</v>

1343
01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the next issue is,</v>

1344
01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:08.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the consequences now of</v>

1345
01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:10.040
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1346
01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:11.173
<v Speaker 3>the</v>

1347
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.823
<v Speaker 1>classification of certain drugs as </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal is that the chemists are faster </v>

1348
01:10:17.511 --> 01:10:18.344
<v Speaker 1>than the legislators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what they do is they keep making </v>

1349
01:10:20.751 --> 01:10:21.584
<v Speaker 1>variants of addictive drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now instead of a dozen drugs of </v>

1350
01:10:24.561 --> 01:10:27.020
<v Speaker 1>abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what we had say 20 years ago,</v>

1351
01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:28.033
<v Speaker 1>we have like 300,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of them are way more addictive </v>

1352
01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:35.450
<v Speaker 1>than the original drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it isn't,</v>

1353
01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:40.550
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't look like good policy to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know that places like Portugal,</v>

1354
01:10:40.551 --> 01:10:41.384
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have decriminalized every drug of abuse </v>

1355
01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:48.110
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't look like it's been a </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe.</v>

1356
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:50.420
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1357
01:10:50.421 --> 01:10:51.254
<v Speaker 1>we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1358
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:53.780
<v Speaker 1>We legalized marijuana yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

1359
01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:57.560
<v Speaker 1>the streets aren't full of stone people </v>
<v Speaker 1>bumping into walls.</v>

1360
01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:00.290
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope it works.</v>

1361
01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:03.680
<v Speaker 1>I hope that the government regulates it </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>

1362
01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:07.360
<v Speaker 1>that they derive tax revenue from it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that um,</v>

1363
01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:12.460
<v Speaker 1>people use pot a little and that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>use alcohol a little less.</v>

1364
01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:16.110
<v Speaker 1>That would be good because alcohol is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous drug.</v>

1365
01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:18.660
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1366
01:11:18.661 --> 01:11:20.790
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to go for eight more </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

1367
01:11:20.791 --> 01:11:21.624
<v Speaker 1>I have to stop comparatively early today</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I have to pack and then I have </v>

1368
01:11:25.801 --> 01:11:29.130
<v Speaker 1>to go to Dublin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so just to warn you all.</v>

1369
01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:30.413
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1370
01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:06.943
<v Speaker 1>do you have any advice on how to vet a </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential marriage partner during the </v>

1371
01:12:10.011 --> 01:12:14.420
<v Speaker 1>dating relationship phase?</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1372
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:18.710
<v Speaker 1>that's a hard question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1373
01:12:18.711 --> 01:12:23.450
<v Speaker 1>So while I can tell you what I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>observed as a consequence of watching,</v>

1374
01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:24.913
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the married people successful and </v>

1375
01:12:26.841 --> 01:12:28.190
<v Speaker 1>unsuccessful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I know,</v>

1376
01:12:28.191 --> 01:12:31.640
<v Speaker 1>but also watching all my clients and </v>
<v Speaker 1>giving this a fair bit of thought.</v>

1377
01:12:32.150 --> 01:12:36.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

1378
01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:41.500
<v Speaker 1>here's some of what's necessary for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful marriage.</v>

1379
01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:47.673
<v Speaker 1>You have to trust the person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean they can't make </v>

1380
01:12:51.611 --> 01:12:53.920
<v Speaker 1>mistakes because you're going to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakes and so are they.</v>

1381
01:12:53.921 --> 01:12:56.710
<v Speaker 1>But fundamentally you have to trust </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1382
01:12:57.010 --> 01:13:02.010
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>trust that if things go wrong,</v>

1383
01:13:02.561 --> 01:13:03.394
<v Speaker 1>if they make a mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll do what was necessary in </v>

1384
01:13:06.191 --> 01:13:07.024
<v Speaker 1>conjunction with you to set it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to negotiate with </v>

1385
01:13:11.381 --> 01:13:13.060
<v Speaker 1>the person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those two things are tied very,</v>

1386
01:13:13.061 --> 01:13:15.610
<v Speaker 1>very close together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>

1387
01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:16.473
<v Speaker 1>you guys have to be able to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation about what it is that you </v>

1388
01:13:20.501 --> 01:13:22.720
<v Speaker 1>want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come to a conclusion,</v>

1389
01:13:25.890 --> 01:13:29.490
<v Speaker 1>moderate your differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>move forward and have that work.</v>

1390
01:13:29.670 --> 01:13:33.120
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to fight and make up</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of those.</v>

1391
01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:37.650
<v Speaker 1>If you can't fight with your potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage partner,</v>

1392
01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:39.113
<v Speaker 1>then you're not communicating because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just no bloody way that you're </v>

1393
01:13:42.961 --> 01:13:43.794
<v Speaker 1>going to get along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you're gonna agree on </v>

1394
01:13:46.231 --> 01:13:47.760
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just not going to happen.</v>

1395
01:13:48.150 --> 01:13:53.150
<v Speaker 1>So you have to be honest with one </v>
<v Speaker 1>another enough to have some conflict.</v>

1396
01:13:54.061 --> 01:13:56.970
<v Speaker 1>But then you have to be able to make up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge deal,</v>

1397
01:13:56.971 --> 01:13:58.800
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because well,</v>

1398
01:13:58.801 --> 01:14:01.170
<v Speaker 1>then you get to have conflict and solve </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems and make up.</v>

1399
01:14:01.890 --> 01:14:05.510
<v Speaker 1>So trust negotiation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1400
01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:06.623
<v Speaker 1>conflict resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next thing I would say is it's kind </v>

1401
01:14:10.351 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 1>of Nice if you're attracted to each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

1402
01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:12.993
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's a strong sexual attraction </v>

1403
01:14:14.501 --> 01:14:15.334
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious to me that that's </v>

1404
01:14:16.931 --> 01:14:19.780
<v Speaker 1>something that can be conjured up if it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't exist.</v>

1405
01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:22.510
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen that happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>successfully.</v>

1406
01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:23.583
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to depend on factors that </v>

1407
01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:29.680
<v Speaker 1>aren't really under voluntary control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1408
01:14:29.681 --> 01:14:30.514
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously people can modify </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves to some degree to be more or </v>

1409
01:14:33.041 --> 01:14:35.930
<v Speaker 1>less attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>staying in physical shape and,</v>

1410
01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:37.570
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that sort of thing.</v>

1411
01:14:37.571 --> 01:14:39.160
<v Speaker 1>Dressing nicely and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1412
01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:40.053
<v Speaker 1>and having a certain amount of sex </v>
<v Speaker 1>appeal and charisma and provocativeness </v>

1413
01:14:44.591 --> 01:14:46.240
<v Speaker 1>that's all there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

1414
01:14:46.241 --> 01:14:47.980
<v Speaker 1>that's all well and good and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

1415
01:14:47.981 --> 01:14:48.814
<v Speaker 1>But I do believe that that spark that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of voluntary control is a </v>

1416
01:14:52.901 --> 01:14:55.810
<v Speaker 1>necessary precondition for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>lasting relationship.</v>

1417
01:14:56.170 --> 01:14:57.003
<v Speaker 1>I do believe though that if it's there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still have to work very hard to </v>

1418
01:15:00.971 --> 01:15:01.804
<v Speaker 1>maintain it as hard in your marriage as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you would when you're dating and you </v>

1419
01:15:04.661 --> 01:15:06.100
<v Speaker 1>need to know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1420
01:15:07.690 --> 01:15:10.570
<v Speaker 1>then it's also helpful if you actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the person,</v>

1421
01:15:10.571 --> 01:15:12.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're your friend that you actually</v>

1422
01:15:12.701 --> 01:15:14.230
<v Speaker 1>liked to go do things with them.</v>

1423
01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Sort of independent of the romantic </v>
<v Speaker 1>element,</v>

1424
01:15:16.691 --> 01:15:17.524
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there,</v>

1425
01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.740
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to want to do everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

1426
01:15:20.741 --> 01:15:24.460
<v Speaker 1>but you should have some things that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to do in common.</v>

1427
01:15:24.670 --> 01:15:27.520
<v Speaker 1>So some similarity in personality is </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful.</v>

1428
01:15:27.970 --> 01:15:30.400
<v Speaker 1>The personality scale is useful for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1429
01:15:30.401 --> 01:15:31.234
<v Speaker 1>Like look here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here it's really hard for an extreme </v>

1430
01:15:33.761 --> 01:15:34.594
<v Speaker 1>extrovert and an extreme introvert to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live together because the extreme </v>

1431
01:15:37.661 --> 01:15:38.494
<v Speaker 1>extrovert wants to meet with people all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time and the extreme introvert is </v>

1432
01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:42.633
<v Speaker 1>immediately exhausted by that and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neither of those things are precisely </v>

1433
01:15:47.711 --> 01:15:50.380
<v Speaker 1>under voluntary control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1434
01:15:50.770 --> 01:15:51.603
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard for someone super </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeable and super disagreeable to get </v>

1435
01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:55.683
<v Speaker 1>along together because the agreeable </v>
<v Speaker 1>person isn't going to be able to stand </v>

1436
01:15:59.711 --> 01:16:00.544
<v Speaker 1>up very well to the disagreeable person </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the disagreeable person is going to </v>

1437
01:16:03.101 --> 01:16:06.160
<v Speaker 1>think that the agreeable person is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushover.</v>

1438
01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:08.230
<v Speaker 1>That's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1439
01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:09.173
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard for someone high in </v>
<v Speaker 1>openness and someone very low and </v>

1440
01:16:11.411 --> 01:16:12.244
<v Speaker 1>openness to be together because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>open person is like fascinated by ideas </v>

1441
01:16:14.981 --> 01:16:15.814
<v Speaker 1>and really interested in this theoretics</v>
<v Speaker 1>and art and philosophy and poetry and </v>

1442
01:16:17.921 --> 01:16:18.640
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>

1443
01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:22.240
<v Speaker 1>And the person who's low in openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like they're colorblind to that.</v>

1444
01:16:22.450 --> 01:16:27.450
<v Speaker 1>It's not in their realm of involuntary </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest.</v>

1445
01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing.</v>

1446
01:16:30.851 --> 01:16:33.670
<v Speaker 1>If if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a very conscientious person,</v>

1447
01:16:33.671 --> 01:16:36.190
<v Speaker 1>very diligent nose to the grindstone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1448
01:16:36.730 --> 01:16:37.563
<v Speaker 1>industrious and orderly and your partner</v>
<v Speaker 1>can while away at the time with no </v>

1449
01:16:41.681 --> 01:16:45.910
<v Speaker 1>problem whatsoever and doesn't mind a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mass in disorder,</v>

1450
01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:46.893
<v Speaker 1>then that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conscientious person is going to </v>

1451
01:16:50.081 --> 01:16:50.914
<v Speaker 1>think that the unconscientious person is</v>
<v Speaker 1>useless and the unconscientious person </v>

1452
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.900
<v Speaker 1>is going to think that the conscientious</v>
<v Speaker 1>person is an uptight tyrant.</v>

1453
01:16:59.290 --> 01:17:02.020
<v Speaker 1>And that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard to overcome.</v>

1454
01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:03.850
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a fatal flaw.</v>

1455
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.480
<v Speaker 1>So those extreme personality differences</v>
<v Speaker 1>across more than one or two traits is,</v>

1456
01:17:08.481 --> 01:17:11.300
<v Speaker 1>is going to make your relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily difficult.</v>

1457
01:17:11.570 --> 01:17:15.500
<v Speaker 1>So the only place where that might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>different is that,</v>

1458
01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:16.843
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably don't want to both be high </v>

1459
01:17:19.191 --> 01:17:20.150
<v Speaker 1>in neuroticism.</v>

1460
01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:24.290
<v Speaker 1>So like if one of you is high in </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism and the other isn't,</v>

1461
01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:25.273
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of a nice balance because </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of you will be a little alert to </v>

1462
01:17:29.571 --> 01:17:33.080
<v Speaker 1>threat and the other one will come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one who is alert to threat down.</v>

1463
01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:34.033
<v Speaker 1>If you're both low in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then that's not going to be too </v>

1464
01:17:36.051 --> 01:17:36.884
<v Speaker 1>much of a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although you might be a little bit less </v>

1465
01:17:39.201 --> 01:17:40.034
<v Speaker 1>risk averse than you should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But mostly you want a fair bit of </v>

1466
01:17:42.621 --> 01:17:43.454
<v Speaker 1>similarity in terms of personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I guess the other thing is is that </v>

1467
01:17:47.210 --> 01:17:50.330
<v Speaker 1>well do you have something like a shared</v>
<v Speaker 1>vision of the future?</v>

1468
01:17:50.331 --> 01:17:51.164
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how are you going to mediate the </v>

1469
01:17:55.910 --> 01:18:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Chi inevitable conflict between whose </v>
<v Speaker 1>career takes priority and,</v>

1470
01:18:00.890 --> 01:18:03.530
<v Speaker 1>and what about kids?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you both want kids?</v>

1471
01:18:03.531 --> 01:18:04.364
<v Speaker 1>And if you do want kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when do you want them and how many do </v>

1472
01:18:06.081 --> 01:18:10.400
<v Speaker 1>you want and what's your sense about </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's responsible for what,</v>

1473
01:18:10.401 --> 01:18:13.430
<v Speaker 1>when with regards to the kids and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same when you're running a household,</v>

1474
01:18:13.431 --> 01:18:15.350
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have some sense of,</v>

1475
01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:16.813
<v Speaker 1>do you have enough shared beliefs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that running a household together is </v>

1476
01:18:19.971 --> 01:18:20.804
<v Speaker 1>something that is with a peaceful </v>
<v Speaker 1>household and a productive household is </v>

1477
01:18:24.141 --> 01:18:29.060
<v Speaker 1>within the realm of possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm [inaudible] that's,</v>

1478
01:18:29.090 --> 01:18:31.070
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it looks like to me.</v>

1479
01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:32.233
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1480
01:18:32.290 --> 01:18:33.123
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

1481
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:36.020
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1482
01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:42.350
<v Speaker 1>you said you act as if God exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you also act as if the devil exists?</v>

1483
01:18:42.410 --> 01:18:43.243
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I probably act even more as if </v>

1484
01:18:44.781 --> 01:18:47.360
<v Speaker 1>the devil exists because it's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some sense.</v>

1485
01:18:47.361 --> 01:18:50.810
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot more easy for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it is for most people.</v>

1486
01:18:51.170 --> 01:18:52.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy.</v>

1487
01:18:52.581 --> 01:18:53.414
<v Speaker 1>It's easier for me to believe in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality of malevolence and evil and to </v>

1488
01:18:57.201 --> 01:18:58.034
<v Speaker 1>be terrified about that getting a grip </v>
<v Speaker 1>on me than it is to be optimistic and </v>

1489
01:19:03.201 --> 01:19:06.320
<v Speaker 1>naive about the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent good.</v>

1490
01:19:06.530 --> 01:19:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just that,</v>

1491
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:12.740
<v Speaker 1>it's not that I am skeptical about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality of transcendent good.</v>

1492
01:19:12.741 --> 01:19:13.574
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally I believe that good is </v>

1493
01:19:16.311 --> 01:19:18.410
<v Speaker 1>more powerful than evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do believe that.</v>

1494
01:19:18.710 --> 01:19:22.010
<v Speaker 1>But there's something palpable about </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil that is,</v>

1495
01:19:22.011 --> 01:19:24.320
<v Speaker 1>and it's also undeniable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1496
01:19:24.590 --> 01:19:25.423
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can debate about whether or not </v>

1497
01:19:26.151 --> 01:19:27.680
<v Speaker 1>heaven exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1498
01:19:27.681 --> 01:19:28.514
<v Speaker 1>and you can even be skeptical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't debate about whether the </v>

1499
01:19:30.651 --> 01:19:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Gulag archipelago exists.</v>

1500
01:19:32.210 --> 01:19:36.440
<v Speaker 1>And you can't debate about Auschwitz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can't debate about the fact that</v>

1501
01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:37.693
<v Speaker 1>people's proclivity towards blindness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and malevolence produced those horrors </v>

1502
01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:42.433
<v Speaker 1>and the horrors that people often </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter in their day to day world and </v>

1503
01:19:44.571 --> 01:19:49.070
<v Speaker 1>in their relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very easy for someone like me to</v>

1504
01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:53.360
<v Speaker 1>be a believer in evil and to try to turn</v>
<v Speaker 1>away from that.</v>

1505
01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:57.860
<v Speaker 1>And so and but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but through deep contemplation,</v>

1506
01:19:57.890 --> 01:19:58.723
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've come to the conclusion that the </v>

1507
01:20:01.161 --> 01:20:01.994
<v Speaker 1>ability of human beings to turn away </v>
<v Speaker 1>from evil and to pursue good is more </v>

1508
01:20:06.591 --> 01:20:09.630
<v Speaker 1>powerful malevolence itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's more of,</v>

1509
01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:11.100
<v Speaker 1>it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's more of a,</v>

1510
01:20:12.610 --> 01:20:16.120
<v Speaker 1>that fills me with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with hope and,</v>

1511
01:20:16.810 --> 01:20:17.643
<v Speaker 1>and and awe I guess is the right word </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I can bring it to mind and think </v>

1512
01:20:23.891 --> 01:20:28.891
<v Speaker 1>that we can in fact defeat malevolence </v>
<v Speaker 1>but sort of on a moment to moment basis,</v>

1513
01:20:31.390 --> 01:20:36.390
<v Speaker 1>the malevolence is so palpable and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>real that it's a more powerful,</v>

1514
01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:45.200
<v Speaker 1>it's a more powerful motivator for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for avoidance.</v>

1515
01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:47.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean avoidance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>

1516
01:20:47.241 --> 01:20:49.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean avoidance of walking down that </v>
<v Speaker 1>path.</v>

1517
01:20:50.030 --> 01:20:52.310
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's probably again </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping with the cycle,</v>

1518
01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:53.173
<v Speaker 1>well known psychological doctrine that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are more loss averse than they </v>

1519
01:20:56.601 --> 01:20:58.040
<v Speaker 1>are gained sensitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1520
01:20:58.041 --> 01:20:58.874
<v Speaker 1>so a loss of x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it upsets you more to lose $5 then it </v>

1521
01:21:03.771 --> 01:21:06.880
<v Speaker 1>does make you happy to gain $5.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1522
01:21:06.910 --> 01:21:11.910
<v Speaker 1>that's a well known psychological fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's because we're more sensitive to</v>

1523
01:21:12.501 --> 01:21:13.334
<v Speaker 1>punishment and negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because while you can die in </v>

1524
01:21:16.701 --> 01:21:18.950
<v Speaker 1>agony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can only be so happy.</v>

1525
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:24.430
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly act as if the devil exists,</v>

1526
01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:25.333
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think I probably believed in the </v>

1527
01:21:27.501 --> 01:21:29.090
<v Speaker 1>devil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

1528
01:21:30.110 --> 01:21:32.720
<v Speaker 1>speaking metaphorically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I believed in God,</v>

1529
01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:33.793
<v Speaker 1>speaking metaphorically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I became convinced of the reality of </v>

1530
01:21:36.471 --> 01:21:40.310
<v Speaker 1>evil and that really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not only that,</v>

1531
01:21:40.311 --> 01:21:42.650
<v Speaker 1>not only convinced of the reality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil,</v>

1532
01:21:42.890 --> 01:21:43.723
<v Speaker 1>but also convinced that everyone was </v>
<v Speaker 1>destined to play their part in that </v>

1533
01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:48.703
<v Speaker 1>including me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that it would be better if I played </v>

1534
01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:52.790
<v Speaker 1>the least part in that as possible.</v>

1535
01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:53.833
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that sort of brings us back to this </v>

1536
01:21:55.131 --> 01:21:55.731
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1537
01:21:55.731 --> 01:21:56.564
<v Speaker 1>a soldier knits and said the line that </v>
<v Speaker 1>divides good from evil runs down the </v>

1538
01:22:02.871 --> 01:22:05.930
<v Speaker 1>heart of every individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1539
01:22:05.931 --> 01:22:07.880
<v Speaker 1>It's an internal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nada.</v>

1540
01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:10.730
<v Speaker 1>It's not between states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not between groups.</v>

1541
01:22:11.450 --> 01:22:12.283
<v Speaker 1>It's between elements of our psyche and </v>
<v Speaker 1>our individual responsibility is to </v>

1542
01:22:17.330 --> 01:22:21.140
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to ameliorate suffering and to constrain</v>

1543
01:22:21.170 --> 01:22:26.170
<v Speaker 1>malevolence and to start with ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a good place to end.</v>

1544
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:32.900
<v Speaker 1>So thank you all very much for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>continued support,</v>

1545
01:22:32.901 --> 01:22:33.734
<v Speaker 1>for paying attention to this q and a for</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that you've offered to me </v>

1546
01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:40.573
<v Speaker 1>over the last few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been an absolutely overwhelming </v>

1547
01:22:43.641 --> 01:22:44.810
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1548
01:22:44.811 --> 01:22:45.644
<v Speaker 1>to go out and do these lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're unbelievably positive </v>

1549
01:22:47.931 --> 01:22:48.764
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To See all these thousands of people </v>

1550
01:22:50.331 --> 01:22:55.331
<v Speaker 1>come out to engage in a serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion about vision and strategy and</v>

1551
01:22:55.971 --> 01:23:00.971
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty and the,</v>

1552
01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:03.313
<v Speaker 1>the possibility that we could all aim </v>
<v Speaker 1>together acting individually towards at </v>

1553
01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:14.500
<v Speaker 1>least a less hellish future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really something.</v>

1554
01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:16.330
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
