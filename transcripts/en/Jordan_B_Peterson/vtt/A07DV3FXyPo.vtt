1
00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:01.813
<v Speaker 1>How's you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud believed that a substantial </v>

2
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.063
<v Speaker 1>proportion of the symptoms he saw among </v>
<v Speaker 1>his clients were of psychological </v>

3
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:12.534
<v Speaker 1>origin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that some of them are </v>

4
00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:16.190
<v Speaker 1>manifest physically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.120
<v Speaker 1>these things do happen by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.900
<v Speaker 1>I had a client who was from eastern </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe from eastern and Eastern European</v>

7
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:24.924
<v Speaker 1>background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is relevant in that I believe her </v>

8
00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:28.854
<v Speaker 1>upbringing to be more similar to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of upbringing that the victorians </v>

9
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.650
<v Speaker 1>that Freud studied were then say more </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people of people in the West.</v>

10
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.250
<v Speaker 1>And she had the same thing that her </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandmother had,</v>

11
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.520
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

12
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.613
<v Speaker 1>psychosomatic epilepsy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so she expressed what we're often </v>

13
00:00:51.571 --> 00:00:54.450
<v Speaker 1>sexual conflicts through epileptic </v>
<v Speaker 1>seizures.</v>

14
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.230
<v Speaker 1>She had an epileptic seizure of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>type in my lab,</v>

15
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.510
<v Speaker 1>my office one day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

16
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was unsure whether they were real or</v>

17
00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:04.434
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've seen people have epileptic </v>

18
00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:07.530
<v Speaker 1>seizures.</v>

19
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.180
<v Speaker 1>And as a general rule it's quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>upsetting.</v>

20
00:01:09.181 --> 00:01:10.980
<v Speaker 1>But she had an epileptic seizure in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>office.</v>

21
00:01:10.981 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I noted was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't really bother me.</v>

22
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.280
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I've noticed about</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a therapist is if someone is,</v>

23
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.370
<v Speaker 1>is manifesting a lot of emotion and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not bothering me,</v>

24
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.170
<v Speaker 1>then it's a good hint that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something wrong,</v>

25
00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:26.004
<v Speaker 1>that it's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about it that isn't </v>

26
00:01:27.451 --> 00:01:28.284
<v Speaker 1>exactly right because it doesn't seem to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hook in your MPA empathic systems the </v>

27
00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:32.580
<v Speaker 1>same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

28
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had another client.</v>

29
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.830
<v Speaker 1>This has actually happened to two of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>clients.</v>

30
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.073
<v Speaker 1>The first one was attacked by her </v>
<v Speaker 1>boyfriend and she was unbelievably </v>

31
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:46.200
<v Speaker 1>naive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was so naive.</v>

32
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.053
<v Speaker 1>You like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could write a whole book about how </v>

33
00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:49.800
<v Speaker 1>naive she was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm serious.</v>

34
00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:52.110
<v Speaker 1>It was unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her parents actually taught her.</v>

35
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.610
<v Speaker 1>This is the literal truth.</v>

36
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Her parents taught her that adults were </v>
<v Speaker 1>angels.</v>

37
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.680
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good way of preparing your </v>
<v Speaker 1>child for the grown up world.</v>

38
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'd had a fight with her boyfriend and</v>

39
00:02:05.641 --> 00:02:10.641
<v Speaker 1>he attacked her with sexual intent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when we went through this and it was</v>

40
00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:16.080
<v Speaker 1>under hypnosis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she described his face.</v>

41
00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:18.420
<v Speaker 1>She said he had a look of sheer </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence,</v>

42
00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:18.781
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

43
00:02:18.781 --> 00:02:21.210
<v Speaker 1>she'd never seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like a 28 year old woman.</v>

44
00:02:21.211 --> 00:02:22.230
<v Speaker 1>She was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had a,</v>

45
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.480
<v Speaker 1>she had an undergraduate degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was no idiot.</v>

46
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked her like,</v>

47
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:27.324
<v Speaker 1>how can you reconcile your belief that </v>
<v Speaker 1>adults were angels with all the things </v>

48
00:02:29.701 --> 00:02:32.610
<v Speaker 1>that you learned about history and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>undergraduate degree?</v>

49
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:33.720
<v Speaker 1>And she basically said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

50
00:02:33.721 --> 00:02:36.780
<v Speaker 1>I just put those things in a compartment</v>
<v Speaker 1>and didn't pay any attention to them.</v>

51
00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:38.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

52
00:02:38.071 --> 00:02:38.904
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she saw this guy's face when he was </v>

53
00:02:40.951 --> 00:02:41.784
<v Speaker 1>intending harm and it was actually the </v>
<v Speaker 1>look on his face that traumatized her </v>

54
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.100
<v Speaker 1>and it traumatized her so badly that she</v>
<v Speaker 1>had severe psychosomatic symptoms severe</v>

55
00:02:50.101 --> 00:02:50.934
<v Speaker 1>enough to get her diagnosed as </v>
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia for five years nonstop at </v>

56
00:02:54.781 --> 00:02:56.340
<v Speaker 1>night for four hours at a time.</v>

57
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 1>And the symptoms were that her whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>body would shake and she would be unable</v>

58
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 1>to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

59
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>And I had another client who had the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing,</v>

60
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.303
<v Speaker 1>not the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a similar thing happened to her in </v>

61
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:13.141
<v Speaker 1>high school where a boy was picking on </v>
<v Speaker 1>her continually with malevolent intent.</v>

62
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:18.421
<v Speaker 1>And the thing that really made that </v>
<v Speaker 1>memory stick in her face was the look of</v>

63
00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:22.150
<v Speaker 1>malevolence on his face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

64
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.333
<v Speaker 1>So you see some people are definitely </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of some behavior that is most </v>

65
00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:33.100
<v Speaker 1>properly explained as far as I can tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms that are similar to Freud's,</v>

66
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.230
<v Speaker 1>what's repressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbearable memories,</v>

67
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:36.064
<v Speaker 1>often sexual and impermissible desires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you defend against things that </v>

68
00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:43.630
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While there's repression,</v>

69
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:45.490
<v Speaker 1>Freud really thought that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>

70
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:46.773
<v Speaker 1>People didn't know they were repressing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I sent you guys a link you may have </v>

71
00:03:49.451 --> 00:03:52.270
<v Speaker 1>noticed about the Gottman studies on </v>
<v Speaker 1>married couples.</v>

72
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.370
<v Speaker 1>I think there are still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Studies are bloody brilliant,</v>

73
00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what Godman found in exactly typical</v>

74
00:03:57.671 --> 00:03:58.504
<v Speaker 1>is that the couples who are going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>divorced when you see them in their </v>

75
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:03.070
<v Speaker 1>natural habitat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all nice to each other,</v>

76
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:07.120
<v Speaker 1>but they're psychophysiological systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>are just going preserved there like prey</v>

77
00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:09.370
<v Speaker 1>and Predator to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

78
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:10.204
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's repression or if </v>

79
00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:13.024
<v Speaker 1>it's suppression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These things are very difficult to </v>

80
00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:16.990
<v Speaker 1>distinguish because they're not that </v>
<v Speaker 1>well defined but.</v>

81
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.020
<v Speaker 1>But there is a lot of activity beneath </v>
<v Speaker 1>the surface,</v>

82
00:04:20.021 --> 00:04:20.854
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with being </v>

83
00:04:21.671 --> 00:04:22.504
<v Speaker 1>psychophysiology logically aroused like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is that the consequences of that </v>

84
00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:27.580
<v Speaker 1>overtime is physical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

85
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.683
<v Speaker 1>Because what's happens when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>aroused like that as you produce a lot </v>

86
00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:34.090
<v Speaker 1>of the stress hormone cortisol and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>activates the general stress response.</v>

87
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.193
<v Speaker 1>And the General Stress Response </v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically Robs your future stores of </v>

88
00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:43.150
<v Speaker 1>energy and ability to overreact in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>present.</v>

89
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.000
<v Speaker 1>And if you do that long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you'll damage your brain.</v>

90
00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:46.834
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's many other things that </v>

91
00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:51.880
<v Speaker 1>happened too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So denial people will just say,</v>

92
00:04:51.881 --> 00:04:52.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not so bad,</v>

93
00:04:52.961 --> 00:04:53.794
<v Speaker 1>or maybe that's normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see a lot of that when I show you </v>

94
00:04:55.121 --> 00:04:57.490
<v Speaker 1>this movie reaction formation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

95
00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.300
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

96
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.470
<v Speaker 1>it's overcompensation in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you really hate your sister and</v>

97
00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:04.150
<v Speaker 1>you buy her a great big Christmas </v>
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>

98
00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:04.984
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you'd like to think that you </v>

99
00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:05.981
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or.</v>

100
00:05:05.981 --> 00:05:08.150
<v Speaker 1>But really you don't like her at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

101
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.560
<v Speaker 1>they're often sibling rivalry can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably intense.</v>

102
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>displacement.</v>

103
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.240
<v Speaker 1>This is a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My boss yells at me,</v>

104
00:05:16.241 --> 00:05:18.760
<v Speaker 1>I yell at my husband,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my husband yells at the baby,</v>

105
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.720
<v Speaker 1>the baby bites the cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

106
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.680
<v Speaker 1>so it's a cascading chain of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of emotion.</v>

107
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.700
<v Speaker 1>Often I find with people though that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they come home and they're in a bad mood</v>

108
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.070
<v Speaker 1>and they're touchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

109
00:05:29.071 --> 00:05:29.904
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

110
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.840
<v Speaker 1>you say something to them and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

111
00:05:31.841 --> 00:05:33.130
<v Speaker 1>they fly off the handle.</v>

112
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.640
<v Speaker 1>It isn't exactly so much that they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppressed or repressed or denied what's</v>

113
00:05:38.741 --> 00:05:41.110
<v Speaker 1>happening at work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least not in any obvious sense.</v>

114
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.273
<v Speaker 1>Not that day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often you have to like prior around in </v>

115
00:05:44.951 --> 00:05:48.460
<v Speaker 1>the person and talk to them and harass </v>
<v Speaker 1>them a bit until they,</v>

116
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often tell emotion arises,</v>

117
00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:55.240
<v Speaker 1>which is partly why Freud thought about </v>
<v Speaker 1>his transformation processes Cathartic.</v>

118
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.080
<v Speaker 1>And then they figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll cry and say,</v>

119
00:05:57.081 --> 00:06:00.320
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really upset at my boss.</v>

120
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.633
<v Speaker 1>And the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not obvious that the person </v>

121
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:03.284
<v Speaker 1>actually knew that when they came home </v>
<v Speaker 1>and like the unconscious issue is quite </v>

122
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.440
<v Speaker 1>a difficult one to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tear apart.</v>

123
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:10.303
<v Speaker 1>My conclusion has been that when people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that repression isn't really much </v>

124
00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:15.854
<v Speaker 1>different than lying except that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lie is initially conscious when you </v>

125
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:22.034
<v Speaker 1>first make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you keep habitually lying about </v>

126
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:25.514
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you develop a little automated circuit </v>

127
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:28.243
<v Speaker 1>that either does the lying or that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>the replacement story at hand and after </v>

128
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.233
<v Speaker 1>200 repetitions at the same damn lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've built a little machine in your </v>

129
00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:36.764
<v Speaker 1>head that handles all that and at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point it can be unconscious because you </v>

130
00:06:39.801 --> 00:06:40.430
<v Speaker 1>don't need it.</v>

131
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.680
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to be conscious to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>that decision anymore.</v>

132
00:06:42.681 --> 00:06:45.770
<v Speaker 1>So if you practice something deceptive </v>
<v Speaker 1>long enough,</v>

133
00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:47.870
<v Speaker 1>I think it becomes habitual and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>

134
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:48.793
<v Speaker 1>So I would recommend that you don't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that unless you want your head full of </v>

135
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:53.900
<v Speaker 1>little pathological monsters that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't control.</v>

136
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's already like that.</v>

137
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.103
<v Speaker 1>That would be a freudian idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Identification is another defense </v>

138
00:07:00.531 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 1>mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're bullied.</v>

139
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.660
<v Speaker 1>You want to become the bully </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationalization.</v>

140
00:07:05.661 --> 00:07:06.980
<v Speaker 1>That's when you don't actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

141
00:07:06.981 --> 00:07:09.560
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing that people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>highly intelligent,</v>

142
00:07:09.561 --> 00:07:10.394
<v Speaker 1>they're really good at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know they've got a problem and they </v>

143
00:07:14.661 --> 00:07:15.494
<v Speaker 1>come up with some perfectly coherent and</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable explanation for the problem </v>

144
00:07:18.891 --> 00:07:19.724
<v Speaker 1>or the misbehavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That has absolutely nothing to do with </v>

145
00:07:21.021 --> 00:07:23.000
<v Speaker 1>what's actually going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you.</v>

146
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.890
<v Speaker 1>If you marry someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

147
00:07:24.891 --> 00:07:28.130
<v Speaker 1>who's more introverted than you or less </v>
<v Speaker 1>verbally fluent,</v>

148
00:07:28.131 --> 00:07:28.964
<v Speaker 1>this is something to really watch out </v>
<v Speaker 1>for it because just because you could </v>

149
00:07:31.371 --> 00:07:34.610
<v Speaker 1>win an argument with someone doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean you're right and if you're verbally</v>

150
00:07:34.611 --> 00:07:37.370
<v Speaker 1>fluent and extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can often tie people up in knots.</v>

151
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:38.443
<v Speaker 1>But I would say beware of that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>just because the person you're arguing </v>

152
00:07:41.241 --> 00:07:42.074
<v Speaker 1>with can't formulate their ideas as fast</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you and just because they may not be </v>

153
00:07:45.711 --> 00:07:48.530
<v Speaker 1>able to hold their own in an argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>

154
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.990
<v Speaker 1>That does not mean they don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they see.</v>

155
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.930
<v Speaker 1>And if you have any intelligence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're married to someone like that,</v>

156
00:07:53.931 --> 00:07:54.764
<v Speaker 1>you actually try to coax what they think</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of them and help them articulate it </v>

157
00:07:58.221 --> 00:07:59.054
<v Speaker 1>and formulate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's always the possibility </v>

158
00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:01.514
<v Speaker 1>that you're doing something underhanded </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sneaky and dangerous in the medium </v>

159
00:08:04.431 --> 00:08:05.264
<v Speaker 1>to longterm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it might be better for both of you </v>

160
00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:09.240
<v Speaker 1>if you figured it out intellectually </v>
<v Speaker 1>ization.</v>

161
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:10.263
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've ever watched a woody allen </v>

162
00:08:10.851 --> 00:08:12.050
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what that is,</v>

163
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:13.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are,</v>

164
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.040
<v Speaker 1>y'all should have had union </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy,</v>

165
00:08:16.041 --> 00:08:18.680
<v Speaker 1>not Freud in psychotherapy because he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a creative person.</v>

166
00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:19.514
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I've noticed is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I have clients who are very </v>

167
00:08:22.341 --> 00:08:23.174
<v Speaker 1>creative and other clients who aren't as</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative and the ones who were creative </v>

168
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:27.163
<v Speaker 1>spontaneously manifest processes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their dreams that are most easily </v>

169
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.020
<v Speaker 1>interpreted in union form.</v>

170
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.750
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem to be the case for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that weren't creative though.</v>

171
00:08:35.751 --> 00:08:40.160
<v Speaker 1>And if I talk to them about mythological</v>
<v Speaker 1>or symbol like ideas,</v>

172
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.113
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't click for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what we usually do things that are </v>

173
00:08:43.311 --> 00:08:44.144
<v Speaker 1>much more practical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What much more like behavior therapy </v>

174
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:49.010
<v Speaker 1>projection is a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not irritated.</v>

175
00:08:49.011 --> 00:08:50.660
<v Speaker 1>Your irritating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

176
00:08:50.661 --> 00:08:51.380
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

177
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.780
<v Speaker 1>it's a toss up often because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

178
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:54.531
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

179
00:08:54.531 --> 00:08:56.550
<v Speaker 1>no one can irritate you without your </v>
<v Speaker 1>permission.</v>

180
00:08:56.551 --> 00:08:57.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe me,</v>

181
00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.673
<v Speaker 1>if you think that you've not been around</v>
<v Speaker 1>some world class irritating people </v>

182
00:09:01.201 --> 00:09:04.710
<v Speaker 1>because there are certainly people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>borderline personalities are like that,</v>

183
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:05.544
<v Speaker 1>who I don't care if you're a safe man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sooner or later you're going to get </v>

184
00:09:08.251 --> 00:09:11.460
<v Speaker 1>irritated because that's actually the </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal of the behavior in large part.</v>

185
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:12.683
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud's fundamental theory was that </v>

186
00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:16.854
<v Speaker 1>unconscious ideas were at the core of </v>
<v Speaker 1>many psychological conflicts like </v>

187
00:09:19.681 --> 00:09:20.970
<v Speaker 1>incomprehensible distress.</v>

188
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.250
<v Speaker 1>Psychosomatic symptoms are </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychosomatic.</v>

189
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:24.143
<v Speaker 1>Cyst is when your body attempts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent something that you're </v>

190
00:09:28.411 --> 00:09:29.280
<v Speaker 1>repressing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

191
00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:32.010
<v Speaker 1>I think there's two ways of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because I don't actually think.</v>

192
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't always think that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

193
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:35.243
<v Speaker 1>I think sometimes the reaction to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation in question is actually </v>

194
00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:41.124
<v Speaker 1>sematic to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then if it's articulated and worked </v>

195
00:09:45.091 --> 00:09:46.440
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body can can.</v>

196
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:50.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like the memory locale shifts or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the representation area shifts.</v>

197
00:09:50.541 --> 00:09:51.960
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a client,</v>

198
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.240
<v Speaker 1>she had a wonderful time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

199
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:55.403
<v Speaker 1>she got fired from her job and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>bundled her into her car and it was </v>

200
00:09:57.841 --> 00:09:58.674
<v Speaker 1>sudden she didn't see it coming and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the way home her car was hit by </v>

201
00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:01.734
<v Speaker 1>another car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like that was a perfect way to be </v>

202
00:10:03.241 --> 00:10:07.350
<v Speaker 1>traumatized because she was already </v>
<v Speaker 1>really upset and on edge obviously,</v>

203
00:10:07.351 --> 00:10:08.184
<v Speaker 1>and then this car hit her at about 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>miles an hour and it hurt her quite </v>

204
00:10:10.621 --> 00:10:11.454
<v Speaker 1>badly and she had minimal brain injury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a really rough one because it </v>

205
00:10:14.821 --> 00:10:19.680
<v Speaker 1>has non specific symptoms and like she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

206
00:10:19.681 --> 00:10:23.340
<v Speaker 1>she'd come to therapy and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to her for her ideas were quite</v>

207
00:10:23.341 --> 00:10:24.174
<v Speaker 1>fragmented so it took us quite a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time to kind of weave a coherent story </v>

208
00:10:28.111 --> 00:10:28.500
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

209
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.110
<v Speaker 1>But she'd sit there like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

210
00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.093
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that I found after</v>
<v Speaker 1>a while when I was working with her was </v>

211
00:10:34.771 --> 00:10:35.604
<v Speaker 1>that I was really uncomfortable watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>her and it was a discomfort that seemed </v>

212
00:10:39.441 --> 00:10:42.600
<v Speaker 1>to center about here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a physiological response,</v>

213
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:46.470
<v Speaker 1>probably a mirroring response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one day I said to her,</v>

214
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:48.570
<v Speaker 1>it was like a spontaneous impulse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

215
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.700
<v Speaker 1>come over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd worked together for a long time.</v>

216
00:10:50.701 --> 00:10:52.260
<v Speaker 1>By the time said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

217
00:10:52.261 --> 00:10:55.140
<v Speaker 1>come over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm leaning on the desk.</v>

218
00:10:55.141 --> 00:10:55.974
<v Speaker 1>So I had her lean on the desk and then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of pounded on her shoulders down </v>

219
00:10:58.530 --> 00:10:59.363
<v Speaker 1>down her spine and she started to cry </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she cried like for 45 minutes and </v>

220
00:11:03.181 --> 00:11:05.490
<v Speaker 1>then that loosened up a shoulder and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then we.</v>

221
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:08.760
<v Speaker 1>Another thing we did was to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had her,</v>

222
00:11:08.761 --> 00:11:10.560
<v Speaker 1>she said she couldn't lift her arm a.</v>

223
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.870
<v Speaker 1>So we were doing basically exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

224
00:11:12.871 --> 00:11:13.704
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lift your arm and then let it go and </v>

225
00:11:15.481 --> 00:11:16.314
<v Speaker 1>then lift your arm another inch and let </v>
<v Speaker 1>it go and then lift your arm another </v>

226
00:11:18.871 --> 00:11:22.320
<v Speaker 1>inch and let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And soon we had her arm up like this.</v>

227
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.273
<v Speaker 1>She had moved her arm above her head in </v>
<v Speaker 1>like five years because she was in this </v>

228
00:11:26.551 --> 00:11:30.930
<v Speaker 1>like protective crouch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a startle response and I think</v>

229
00:11:30.931 --> 00:11:31.764
<v Speaker 1>that if you're traumatized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often what happens is your body throws </v>

230
00:11:33.691 --> 00:11:38.400
<v Speaker 1>itself into a state of hyper preparation</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then unless you can,</v>

231
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:45.650
<v Speaker 1>unless you can bring the meaning of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatic event up and articulate it and</v>

232
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.480
<v Speaker 1>throw away what it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

233
00:11:48.481 --> 00:11:49.314
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when she got hit by the car and </v>

234
00:11:50.401 --> 00:11:52.380
<v Speaker 1>lost her job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of her idea was,</v>

235
00:11:52.381 --> 00:11:53.710
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life is over now,</v>

236
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:54.573
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can understand why someone </v>

237
00:11:55.811 --> 00:11:56.644
<v Speaker 1>would think that.</v>

238
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:58.270
<v Speaker 1>So I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

239
00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.890
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's understandable,</v>

240
00:11:59.891 --> 00:12:04.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's too global and vague </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulation to be helpful,</v>

241
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.940
<v Speaker 1>but if your life is over and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing you can do,</v>

242
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.850
<v Speaker 1>this is probably the right thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

243
00:12:09.851 --> 00:12:10.684
<v Speaker 1>And so sometimes it's not so much that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the simplest sematic symptoms are a </v>

244
00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:16.000
<v Speaker 1>consequence of repression and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolic,</v>

245
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:17.103
<v Speaker 1>symbolic representation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that the actual response to the </v>

246
00:12:20.021 --> 00:12:23.620
<v Speaker 1>event starts out physiological and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>never gets any farther than that.</v>

247
00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:26.830
<v Speaker 1>And so partly what you're doing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's,</v>

248
00:12:26.831 --> 00:12:29.530
<v Speaker 1>it's like a permanent manifestation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stress response.</v>

249
00:12:29.531 --> 00:12:30.364
<v Speaker 1>So he thought of behavior anomalies in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this way and hallucinations and </v>

250
00:12:33.641 --> 00:12:34.474
<v Speaker 1>delusions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of this stuff is dead on as </v>

251
00:12:36.431 --> 00:12:39.040
<v Speaker 1>far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you see this,</v>

252
00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:43.630
<v Speaker 1>you see this a lot with people that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have an intimate relationship with.</v>

253
00:12:43.631 --> 00:12:44.464
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's something off about what </v>

254
00:12:46.271 --> 00:12:46.780
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>

255
00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:47.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

256
00:12:47.621 --> 00:12:49.210
<v Speaker 1>in the gottman study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good example.</v>

257
00:12:49.211 --> 00:12:50.044
<v Speaker 1>You know how Gottman said I'm the </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful couples have responded to </v>

258
00:12:53.801 --> 00:12:55.120
<v Speaker 1>each other's bids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

259
00:12:55.121 --> 00:12:56.900
<v Speaker 1>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in the house and your,</v>

260
00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.620
<v Speaker 1>your wife says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

261
00:12:59.020 --> 00:12:59.841
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

262
00:12:59.841 --> 00:13:02.110
<v Speaker 1>there's a cardinal in the backyard and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really pretty,</v>

263
00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:02.973
<v Speaker 1>you know what that means is maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could come over here and look at this </v>

264
00:13:05.831 --> 00:13:06.664
<v Speaker 1>bird with me and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would help me understand that you </v>

265
00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:10.510
<v Speaker 1>liked me and they're interested in what </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing,</v>

266
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.120
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can say in Gottman's terms,</v>

267
00:13:13.121 --> 00:13:13.954
<v Speaker 1>you can just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to look at your stupid </v>

268
00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:18.010
<v Speaker 1>bird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a great response.</v>

269
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:21.820
<v Speaker 1>Or you can say really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

270
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:23.523
<v Speaker 1>you put down your newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is and look like you're </v>

271
00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:27.380
<v Speaker 1>really perturbed and then you walk over </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and no,</v>

272
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:28.263
<v Speaker 1>that's a good response to because then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can also destroy her pleasure and </v>

273
00:13:30.581 --> 00:13:31.330
<v Speaker 1>looking at the bird.</v>

274
00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.760
<v Speaker 1>So without really looking like a son of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bitch.</v>

275
00:13:33.761 --> 00:13:36.490
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you can just sort of see.</v>

276
00:13:36.491 --> 00:13:39.040
<v Speaker 1>I love that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which means,</v>

277
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:40.240
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're annoying.</v>

278
00:13:40.241 --> 00:13:41.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm so put upon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

279
00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:42.483
<v Speaker 1>you're always asking me to do stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and I'm so generous and giving </v>

280
00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:47.253
<v Speaker 1>and here you are exploiting me again and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you go over and you look at the </v>

281
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:50.951
<v Speaker 1>burden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

282
00:13:50.951 --> 00:13:54.610
<v Speaker 1>maybe a smile with your mouth but not </v>
<v Speaker 1>your eyes and that's real nice.</v>

283
00:13:54.611 --> 00:13:55.444
<v Speaker 1>And then the other one is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you go over there like civilized </v>

284
00:13:56.951 --> 00:13:59.830
<v Speaker 1>human being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like interacting with someone that you'd</v>

285
00:13:59.831 --> 00:14:01.990
<v Speaker 1>actually like to get along with for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next 30 years.</v>

286
00:14:01.991 --> 00:14:04.450
<v Speaker 1>But the things in all those other three </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories,</v>

287
00:14:04.451 --> 00:14:08.350
<v Speaker 1>those are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is like just in that Psi,</v>

288
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:11.350
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole bloody massive snakes </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath it.</v>

289
00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:12.184
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>

290
00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:16.330
<v Speaker 1>if you watch someone who does that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you go after them,</v>

291
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.193
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you decide you're going to solve </v>

292
00:14:18.041 --> 00:14:20.890
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to dig down into that side.</v>

293
00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:23.950
<v Speaker 1>Like God only knows how deep it might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a decade old,</v>

294
00:14:23.951 --> 00:14:25.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're harboring some bloody resentment</v>

295
00:14:25.841 --> 00:14:30.270
<v Speaker 1>that occurred like 15 years ago is those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are just stacked up like,</v>

296
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:34.660
<v Speaker 1>like little bombs underneath the surface</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this little tiny behavioral auction.</v>

297
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.060
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And usually people will just ignore it,</v>

298
00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.600
<v Speaker 1>which is not a good idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because they're conflict avoidant,</v>

299
00:14:40.601 --> 00:14:41.434
<v Speaker 1>people are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very conflict avoidant and they like to </v>

300
00:14:43.271 --> 00:14:44.081
<v Speaker 1>think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

301
00:14:44.081 --> 00:14:45.790
<v Speaker 1>if everything's just all right right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

302
00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.740
<v Speaker 1>it'll stay all right into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

303
00:14:47.741 --> 00:14:48.574
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it won't,</v>

304
00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:49.563
<v Speaker 1>it absolutely will not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't deal with little </v>

305
00:14:51.441 --> 00:14:53.900
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then all the monsters that are packed up</v>

306
00:14:53.901 --> 00:14:56.090
<v Speaker 1>inside the will eventually eat you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

307
00:14:56.091 --> 00:14:56.924
<v Speaker 1>but that's a while in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't really have to worry about </v>

308
00:14:58.821 --> 00:15:00.140
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a very good,</v>

309
00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:01.820
<v Speaker 1>a good way of thinking about things.</v>

310
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:03.103
<v Speaker 1>Freud also noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>noticed that people make jokes about </v>

311
00:15:06.921 --> 00:15:07.754
<v Speaker 1>things that are often repressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's definitely the case if you </v>

312
00:15:10.131 --> 00:15:10.964
<v Speaker 1>watch a good comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the ones that are a little </v>

313
00:15:13.101 --> 00:15:13.934
<v Speaker 1>bit more on the outrageous side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing constantly is saying </v>

314
00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:20.360
<v Speaker 1>things that people don't want to believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>but know are true.</v>

315
00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:24.020
<v Speaker 1>And so they'll reveal something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows and everybody will laugh</v>

316
00:15:24.021 --> 00:15:25.250
<v Speaker 1>because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that.</v>

317
00:15:25.251 --> 00:15:27.410
<v Speaker 1>But you're not supposed to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

318
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.750
<v Speaker 1>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Indian comic from.</v>

319
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.981
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

320
00:15:30.981 --> 00:15:31.731
<v Speaker 1>that's the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

321
00:15:31.731 --> 00:15:33.290
<v Speaker 1>he's always making racial jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

322
00:15:33.291 --> 00:15:35.480
<v Speaker 1>So funny because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole audience is full of,</v>

323
00:15:35.481 --> 00:15:36.314
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really racially and ethnically mixed </v>

324
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:38.563
<v Speaker 1>mixed audience and all he does is pick </v>
<v Speaker 1>out people in like assault them for </v>

325
00:15:42.611 --> 00:15:45.230
<v Speaker 1>their race or ethnic identity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all laughing way like,</v>

326
00:15:45.231 --> 00:15:47.000
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so cute that we're all in here like</v>

327
00:15:47.001 --> 00:15:49.520
<v Speaker 1>insulting each other and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

328
00:15:49.521 --> 00:15:50.480
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

329
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:52.660
<v Speaker 1>he's giving voice to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

330
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:58.990
<v Speaker 1>what to commonly held stereotypes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>no one will admit to holding or knowing.</v>

331
00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:03.260
<v Speaker 1>And so it's kind of a relief to everyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have that broad out in the open,</v>

332
00:16:03.261 --> 00:16:04.094
<v Speaker 1>in some safe place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So slips of the tongue are also an </v>

333
00:16:07.221 --> 00:16:08.054
<v Speaker 1>interesting phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can watch people very carefully for </v>

334
00:16:09.891 --> 00:16:10.724
<v Speaker 1>this because now and then they'll say </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that means something other </v>

335
00:16:14.061 --> 00:16:17.780
<v Speaker 1>than what they thought it would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it means something contrary or it's a</v>

336
00:16:17.781 --> 00:16:18.614
<v Speaker 1>hint into one of these like stacks of </v>
<v Speaker 1>monsters that normally they didn't want </v>

337
00:16:22.971 --> 00:16:26.120
<v Speaker 1>to admit to and you have to be sharp to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to catch these things.</v>

338
00:16:26.121 --> 00:16:26.954
<v Speaker 1>You have to pay real attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can also see the same thing with </v>

339
00:16:29.571 --> 00:16:30.404
<v Speaker 1>micro-expressions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often with people that's given rise to </v>

340
00:16:32.811 --> 00:16:33.644
<v Speaker 1>this whole new politically correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement about suppressing </v>

341
00:16:35.811 --> 00:16:36.644
<v Speaker 1>microaggression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like one of the most </v>

342
00:16:37.701 --> 00:16:40.490
<v Speaker 1>pathological things I've ever heard of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

343
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.353
<v Speaker 1>like getting rid of your micro </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression expressions that does not </v>

344
00:16:44.271 --> 00:16:48.590
<v Speaker 1>make you a good person just makes you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>trickier sort of psychopath.</v>

345
00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:49.903
<v Speaker 1>So Freud also was extremely interested </v>
<v Speaker 1>in dreams and his theory was that a </v>

346
00:16:55.251 --> 00:16:59.150
<v Speaker 1>dream was a wish fulfillment and like I </v>
<v Speaker 1>really don't think that's a good theory.</v>

347
00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:03.230
<v Speaker 1>I think that sometimes some dreams have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a wish like element,</v>

348
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:04.303
<v Speaker 1>although I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I'm not very fond of the </v>

349
00:17:06.441 --> 00:17:08.750
<v Speaker 1>wish fulfillment theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's comprehensive enough.</v>

350
00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:09.853
<v Speaker 1>His,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other things he had to say about </v>

351
00:17:11.211 --> 00:17:13.520
<v Speaker 1>dreams were absolutely brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

352
00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:15.980
<v Speaker 1>his book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to read one book by Freud,</v>

353
00:17:15.981 --> 00:17:16.814
<v Speaker 1>I would say the book on dreams is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best and unfortunately at the moment I </v>

354
00:17:19.701 --> 00:17:23.210
<v Speaker 1>can't remember what it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interpretation of dreams,</v>

355
00:17:23.211 --> 00:17:25.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very thick book and you know,</v>

356
00:17:25.071 --> 00:17:27.860
<v Speaker 1>it can't boil down Freud's theory of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams.</v>

357
00:17:27.861 --> 00:17:29.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a whole book into one phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wish,</v>

358
00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:30.674
<v Speaker 1>fulfillment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know he's way smarter than that and </v>

359
00:17:31.911 --> 00:17:33.440
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

360
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.810
<v Speaker 1>for each writing is sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction.</v>

361
00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:37.880
<v Speaker 1>You can't condense it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to read it.</v>

362
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:39.043
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it seems obvious like if the </v>

363
00:17:41.721 --> 00:17:44.750
<v Speaker 1>dream is of a sexual nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can easily see whether that might be</v>

364
00:17:44.751 --> 00:17:45.490
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

365
00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:47.090
<v Speaker 1>a wish fulfillment or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

366
00:17:47.091 --> 00:17:47.924
<v Speaker 1>In hungry people will dream about food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not the case that and lonely </v>

367
00:17:51.631 --> 00:17:54.660
<v Speaker 1>people will dream about social comfort </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so forth.</v>

368
00:17:54.661 --> 00:17:55.494
<v Speaker 1>So it's not the case precisely that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dream can't have anything to do with </v>

369
00:17:59.071 --> 00:18:00.510
<v Speaker 1>wishes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jung's idea,</v>

370
00:18:00.511 --> 00:18:01.344
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a better idea and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's more grounded in how we </v>

371
00:18:03.481 --> 00:18:04.314
<v Speaker 1>understand dreams in the modern world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that the dream was compensate Tory </v>

372
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:08.783
<v Speaker 1>so that if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had a particularly rigid </v>

373
00:18:10.951 --> 00:18:11.784
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint and in of the world and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>rigid viewpoint was actually impeding </v>

374
00:18:15.091 --> 00:18:15.924
<v Speaker 1>your progress forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the dream would spin up counter </v>

375
00:18:19.381 --> 00:18:23.840
<v Speaker 1>propositional fantasies in an attempt to</v>
<v Speaker 1>update the,</v>

376
00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:24.933
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stiffening in the and the rigidity </v>

377
00:18:26.821 --> 00:18:28.680
<v Speaker 1>of the more explicit belief system.</v>

378
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.513
<v Speaker 1>And</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's some good evidence for </v>

379
00:18:32.281 --> 00:18:35.010
<v Speaker 1>that in modern studies of dreaming it </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems.</v>

380
00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:39.490
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly the case that dreams do </v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to update your memory and our eyes.</v>

381
00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.370
<v Speaker 1>I think partly what the dreams are doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

382
00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:43.980
<v Speaker 1>and this is maybe where some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolic content comes from,</v>

383
00:18:43.981 --> 00:18:46.680
<v Speaker 1>is there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

384
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:50.910
<v Speaker 1>it's not obvious how you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure a category,</v>

385
00:18:50.911 --> 00:18:51.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because categories,</v>

386
00:18:51.911 --> 00:18:52.890
<v Speaker 1>they're very fluid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

387
00:18:52.891 --> 00:18:55.620
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well all men is a good category,</v>

388
00:18:55.621 --> 00:18:56.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you might think,</v>

389
00:18:56.461 --> 00:18:57.294
<v Speaker 1>well all white men and old non white men</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a good category depending on what </v>

390
00:18:59.821 --> 00:19:02.130
<v Speaker 1>you're discussing and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

391
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:02.993
<v Speaker 1>the contents of your categories often </v>
<v Speaker 1>depend on what you want to do with the </v>

392
00:19:06.391 --> 00:19:07.224
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not obvious what should be in </v>

393
00:19:08.371 --> 00:19:11.550
<v Speaker 1>the box and what should it be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And partly what the dream is doing too,</v>

394
00:19:11.551 --> 00:19:14.130
<v Speaker 1>is by loosening up the categorical </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

395
00:19:14.131 --> 00:19:14.964
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because things can fluidly change and </v>

396
00:19:16.261 --> 00:19:17.550
<v Speaker 1>transform and dreams.</v>

397
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:21.990
<v Speaker 1>And it allows you to experiment with re </v>
<v Speaker 1>categorization while you're asleep,</v>

398
00:19:21.991 --> 00:19:25.290
<v Speaker 1>without having to suffer the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of that in the waking world</v>

399
00:19:25.291 --> 00:19:26.124
<v Speaker 1>because you're paralyzed right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's more accurate to think </v>

400
00:19:28.351 --> 00:19:29.184
<v Speaker 1>of the dream as an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as part of the process by which new </v>

401
00:19:31.321 --> 00:19:36.060
<v Speaker 1>knowledge becomes eventually articulated</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's more of a union perspective.</v>

402
00:19:36.061 --> 00:19:36.894
<v Speaker 1>So you start out not knowing anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and then maybe you can code it </v>

403
00:19:40.231 --> 00:19:41.064
<v Speaker 1>onto your behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be something piaget would </v>

404
00:19:42.571 --> 00:19:43.404
<v Speaker 1>suggest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then after it's coated onto </v>

405
00:19:44.761 --> 00:19:45.594
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can start expressing it in </v>

406
00:19:47.221 --> 00:19:49.620
<v Speaker 1>image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in dynamic images.</v>

407
00:19:49.621 --> 00:19:50.454
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction and so you can think of dreams </v>

408
00:19:52.831 --> 00:19:53.664
<v Speaker 1>as a kind of fiction and then once </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got the thing laid out in </v>

409
00:19:56.311 --> 00:19:58.260
<v Speaker 1>fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's kind of coherent,</v>

410
00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:01.950
<v Speaker 1>then it's not a huge leap from that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>having an articulated model.</v>

411
00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:02.993
<v Speaker 1>And I think a lot of what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you do dream interpretation in </v>

412
00:20:05.101 --> 00:20:05.934
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy is you're doing the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that you would do if you were </v>

413
00:20:08.401 --> 00:20:10.470
<v Speaker 1>interpreting literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

414
00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.910
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

415
00:20:11.911 --> 00:20:12.744
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it worthwhile thinking about </v>

416
00:20:13.291 --> 00:20:14.130
<v Speaker 1>literature?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

417
00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.210
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

418
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:17.100
<v Speaker 1>it's worthwhile reading it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

419
00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.590
<v Speaker 1>Is it worthwhile thinking about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're reading?</v>

420
00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.230
<v Speaker 1>It's different process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like arguably,</v>

421
00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:23.183
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the dream has a function and it does </v>

422
00:20:24.571 --> 00:20:25.404
<v Speaker 1>whatever dreams do and then perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also some utility in attending </v>

423
00:20:28.711 --> 00:20:32.760
<v Speaker 1>to the dream consciously and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>elaborate upon its contents.</v>

424
00:20:32.761 --> 00:20:35.460
<v Speaker 1>And Freud would do that with Free </v>
<v Speaker 1>Association and works.</v>

425
00:20:35.461 --> 00:20:36.870
<v Speaker 1>It really works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite fun.</v>

426
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:38.640
<v Speaker 1>If you have someone who's a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreamer,</v>

427
00:20:38.641 --> 00:20:39.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

428
00:20:39.241 --> 00:20:39.830
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

429
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:42.960
<v Speaker 1>the way I do it as they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tell me the dream,</v>

430
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:47.110
<v Speaker 1>they read it and I listened to it and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>let my imagination work on it.</v>

431
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.943
<v Speaker 1>So it kind of builds up an association </v>
<v Speaker 1>net and then I have them start from the </v>

432
00:20:52.601 --> 00:20:53.434
<v Speaker 1>beginning again and whenever they come </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a theme or an object or something </v>

433
00:20:55.931 --> 00:20:58.870
<v Speaker 1>like that that's identifiable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I asked them what that reminds them</v>

434
00:20:58.871 --> 00:21:02.950
<v Speaker 1>up and so to me what we're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>flushing out the association network and</v>

435
00:21:02.951 --> 00:21:03.784
<v Speaker 1>that's a freudian idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you walk through the whole </v>

436
00:21:06.071 --> 00:21:09.490
<v Speaker 1>dream like and then people will </v>
<v Speaker 1>associate and then that will remind them</v>

437
00:21:09.491 --> 00:21:10.324
<v Speaker 1>of something and then maybe they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember why a specific date is in the </v>

438
00:21:13.121 --> 00:21:13.954
<v Speaker 1>dream or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like the dream is putting </v>

439
00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:17.734
<v Speaker 1>together ideas that have a vague cloud </v>
<v Speaker 1>around them and it's trying to sequence </v>

440
00:21:20.741 --> 00:21:21.574
<v Speaker 1>and organize them and you seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to facilitate that process with </v>

441
00:21:24.821 --> 00:21:26.860
<v Speaker 1>conscious reflection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

442
00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:30.310
<v Speaker 1>and for some people it's extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful.</v>

443
00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:32.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things young said,</v>

444
00:21:32.891 --> 00:21:33.724
<v Speaker 1>which I really liked was that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck in a problem and you can't solve </v>

445
00:21:36.071 --> 00:21:38.200
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no idea how to solve a terrible</v>

446
00:21:38.201 --> 00:21:39.250
<v Speaker 1>conflict of some sort.</v>

447
00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.880
<v Speaker 1>You have to look where you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he thought,</v>

448
00:21:42.881 --> 00:21:44.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the places that you don't know is</v>

449
00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.210
<v Speaker 1>in your dreams and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

450
00:21:46.211 --> 00:21:47.044
<v Speaker 1>dreams are doing something and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>good evidence that part of what dreams </v>

451
00:21:49.451 --> 00:21:51.850
<v Speaker 1>are doing is dealing with novel </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

452
00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:53.113
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to conceptualize novel </v>

453
00:21:54.101 --> 00:21:54.934
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a good place to look for </v>

454
00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:57.003
<v Speaker 1>new potential solutions because you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>also think of the dream as part of a </v>

455
00:22:00.431 --> 00:22:05.050
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis generating mechanism that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would also be the creative imagination.</v>

456
00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:08.710
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think often the reason,</v>

457
00:22:08.711 --> 00:22:09.544
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe the reason that sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>people remember dreams that are </v>

458
00:22:13.061 --> 00:22:13.894
<v Speaker 1>extremely emotional and they feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>compelled to tell them is perhaps is </v>

459
00:22:17.801 --> 00:22:18.634
<v Speaker 1>because the people who did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about it from an evolutionary </v>

460
00:22:21.641 --> 00:22:22.474
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people who did that and expose the </v>

461
00:22:24.491 --> 00:22:25.324
<v Speaker 1>fantasy to the group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're more likely to gather information </v>

462
00:22:28.181 --> 00:22:31.720
<v Speaker 1>about what it meant and possibly more </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to survive.</v>

463
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.630
<v Speaker 1>And so there seems to be a trigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

464
00:22:34.631 --> 00:22:35.464
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>above which the dream is specifically </v>

465
00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:39.550
<v Speaker 1>particularly sufficiently emotionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>impactful.</v>

466
00:22:39.551 --> 00:22:40.384
<v Speaker 1>So the actually remember when you wake </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and you would also often consider </v>

467
00:22:43.241 --> 00:22:44.620
<v Speaker 1>those big dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

468
00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:45.573
<v Speaker 1>especially if they had archetipal </v>
<v Speaker 1>content and those would also sometimes </v>

469
00:22:47.561 --> 00:22:52.330
<v Speaker 1>be dreams that had relevance beyond the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relevance to the specific individual.</v>

470
00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:53.493
<v Speaker 1>So they might be dreams that are working</v>
<v Speaker 1>really hard on a problem that's </v>

471
00:22:56.111 --> 00:22:57.550
<v Speaker 1>collective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

472
00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:58.451
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

473
00:22:58.451 --> 00:23:00.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do new ideas come from?</v>

474
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:03.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they just appeared in my head.</v>

475
00:23:03.131 --> 00:23:05.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's not a very good theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

476
00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:09.700
<v Speaker 1>the idea has a birthplace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the birthplace is in the unknown.</v>

477
00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:10.773
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>elaboration of that information before </v>

478
00:23:14.261 --> 00:23:18.370
<v Speaker 1>it ever gets up to where it pops into </v>
<v Speaker 1>your head is an articulated statement,</v>

479
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a,</v>

480
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:24.490
<v Speaker 1>that's not an instantaneous magical </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation or maybe you can think it</v>

481
00:23:24.491 --> 00:23:25.360
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

482
00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:29.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a very useful theory.</v>

483
00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:33.790
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that there are multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>stages of processing of information each</v>

484
00:23:33.791 --> 00:23:34.624
<v Speaker 1>with their own natures much more in </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping with the way that modern people </v>

485
00:23:37.361 --> 00:23:40.960
<v Speaker 1>look at the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is as a Oregon that's evolved,</v>

486
00:23:40.961 --> 00:23:41.794
<v Speaker 1>that has very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very archaic elements like massively </v>

487
00:23:43.961 --> 00:23:45.890
<v Speaker 1>archaic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the ones I told you about that were</v>

488
00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.430
<v Speaker 1>you share it with lobsters and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of weird systems built</v>

489
00:23:49.431 --> 00:23:53.060
<v Speaker 1>on top of that that are basically there </v>
<v Speaker 1>for biological purposes.</v>

490
00:23:53.061 --> 00:23:53.894
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a cortical cap that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of elaborates and all those things </v>

491
00:23:56.931 --> 00:24:01.040
<v Speaker 1>are working together to extract out </v>
<v Speaker 1>information that you can use for living.</v>

492
00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:04.790
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly not mechanical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not exactly computational.</v>

493
00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.120
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a multistage process.</v>

494
00:24:08.121 --> 00:24:12.200
<v Speaker 1>And dreams and imagination are involved </v>
<v Speaker 1>at least at the hypothesis stage.</v>

495
00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:13.243
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can think of dream as a </v>

496
00:24:14.301 --> 00:24:17.540
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and although I don't think,</v>

497
00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:21.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's reasonable to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that dreams do one thing anymore than it</v>

498
00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:23.660
<v Speaker 1>is reasonable to say that thinking does </v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing,</v>

499
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.033
<v Speaker 1>but the competence Satori idea is a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>one and you can kind of think of the </v>

500
00:24:27.741 --> 00:24:29.690
<v Speaker 1>wish fulfillment ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that subset of that.</v>

501
00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:30.913
<v Speaker 1>So the dream is also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud says that process of regression </v>

502
00:24:34.401 --> 00:24:35.234
<v Speaker 1>that manifests itself simultaneously in </v>
<v Speaker 1>three fashions as topical regression </v>

503
00:24:38.661 --> 00:24:39.494
<v Speaker 1>from the conscious to the unconscious as</v>
<v Speaker 1>temporal regression from the present </v>

504
00:24:42.921 --> 00:24:43.754
<v Speaker 1>time to childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you see this with people </v>

505
00:24:45.231 --> 00:24:48.370
<v Speaker 1>who've had repetitive nightmares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing I can tell you,</v>

506
00:24:48.371 --> 00:24:50.660
<v Speaker 1>you can try this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a repetitive nightmare,</v>

507
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:54.830
<v Speaker 1>usually it presents the same thematic </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem over and over.</v>

508
00:24:54.831 --> 00:24:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe you're being chased by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>monster when you turn around.</v>

509
00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:59.023
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe your hands are tied or something </v>

510
00:25:00.741 --> 00:25:01.680
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

511
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:03.560
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you told me about that,</v>

512
00:25:03.561 --> 00:25:04.370
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

513
00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:06.590
<v Speaker 1>who or what is tying your hands?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

514
00:25:06.591 --> 00:25:09.500
<v Speaker 1>That would be the first question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things you can do to make</v>

515
00:25:09.501 --> 00:25:13.790
<v Speaker 1>that nightmare go away is to sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reimagine the nightmare,</v>

516
00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:14.653
<v Speaker 1>and fix the ending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you have to come up with a </v>

517
00:25:16.461 --> 00:25:17.450
<v Speaker 1>reasonable ending.</v>

518
00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:20.360
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a client who was afraid.</v>

519
00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:22.880
<v Speaker 1>She had a cabin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was very interesting case.</v>

520
00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.910
<v Speaker 1>She had a mouse phobia and she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid mice would run up her leg.</v>

521
00:25:25.911 --> 00:25:26.744
<v Speaker 1>That was the specific content of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phobia and she had a cabin and she </v>

522
00:25:29.301 --> 00:25:31.190
<v Speaker 1>didn't like to go to the cabin for two </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

523
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:32.203
<v Speaker 1>One was a mouse might run up her leg and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second was she was up there alone </v>

524
00:25:35.601 --> 00:25:38.540
<v Speaker 1>and she was afraid that she would get </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacked and sexually assaulted.</v>

525
00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:39.403
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't take much of a frailty and</v>
<v Speaker 1>genius to figure out the connection </v>

526
00:25:41.721 --> 00:25:42.554
<v Speaker 1>between those two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things we did was first </v>

527
00:25:45.411 --> 00:25:47.930
<v Speaker 1>of all talk it through as if it was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable fear.</v>

528
00:25:47.931 --> 00:25:48.441
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

529
00:25:48.441 --> 00:25:51.710
<v Speaker 1>you are up there alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you could have an alarm system and</v>

530
00:25:51.711 --> 00:25:53.000
<v Speaker 1>some good locks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

531
00:25:53.001 --> 00:25:55.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your fear might be predicated on some</v>

532
00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:56.713
<v Speaker 1>realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some realistic appraisal which you're </v>

533
00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.670
<v Speaker 1>repressing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not dealing with it.</v>

534
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:05.300
<v Speaker 1>It is potentially dangerous fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get a dog,</v>

535
00:26:05.301 --> 00:26:06.134
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we did all that and simultaneously </v>

536
00:26:09.051 --> 00:26:09.884
<v Speaker 1>treated or most phobia through </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral exposure and then she was </v>

537
00:26:13.101 --> 00:26:16.670
<v Speaker 1>having these dreams of these guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking in and raping her and so we had</v>

538
00:26:16.671 --> 00:26:17.504
<v Speaker 1>her walk through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she bought a bat and put it by </v>

539
00:26:19.401 --> 00:26:21.260
<v Speaker 1>her bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was something I suggested.</v>

540
00:26:21.261 --> 00:26:22.094
<v Speaker 1>And then we walked her through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walked her through the dream and we </v>

541
00:26:25.641 --> 00:26:26.474
<v Speaker 1>changed the ending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what she did was the guy climbed in </v>

542
00:26:27.981 --> 00:26:30.720
<v Speaker 1>the window and she picked up the bat and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she smacked him one and then she sprayed</v>

543
00:26:30.721 --> 00:26:31.554
<v Speaker 1>him with oven cleaner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like a really nasty thing to </v>

544
00:26:33.201 --> 00:26:34.034
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then she tied him up in a chair and she </v>

545
00:26:35.181 --> 00:26:36.014
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was dancing around in the office </v>

546
00:26:37.461 --> 00:26:38.660
<v Speaker 1>thinking that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

547
00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:40.790
<v Speaker 1>that's a hero myth essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

548
00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:41.863
<v Speaker 1>We changed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we transformed the dream from victim to </v>

549
00:26:43.351 --> 00:26:45.420
<v Speaker 1>hero essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was the end of her nightmares.</v>

550
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:46.463
<v Speaker 1>And that happens more often than you </v>
<v Speaker 1>than you might think because the dream </v>

551
00:26:49.051 --> 00:26:50.490
<v Speaker 1>is presenting you with the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

552
00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:52.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like a threat detection mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>

553
00:26:52.801 --> 00:26:53.634
<v Speaker 1>well here's the threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's expressing it in symbolic </v>

554
00:26:55.651 --> 00:26:59.850
<v Speaker 1>terms or maybe it's using a general </v>
<v Speaker 1>category like monster.</v>

555
00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:02.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like our monsters chasing you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

556
00:27:02.791 --> 00:27:05.670
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what you mean by monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But functionally,</v>

557
00:27:05.671 --> 00:27:07.770
<v Speaker 1>yes they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

558
00:27:07.771 --> 00:27:08.730
<v Speaker 1>while you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

559
00:27:08.731 --> 00:27:11.790
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizing them as monsters isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly accurate.</v>

560
00:27:11.791 --> 00:27:12.624
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

561
00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.540
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly clear that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate.</v>

562
00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:17.913
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

563
00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.013
<v Speaker 1>I think a monster is a monster is like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of the class of all </v>

564
00:27:24.021 --> 00:27:26.090
<v Speaker 1>things that could chase you and devour </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

565
00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.450
<v Speaker 1>And there's lots of those that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolic and articulate.</v>

566
00:27:29.451 --> 00:27:32.690
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're arguing with someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>can defeat you or you know,</v>

567
00:27:32.691 --> 00:27:34.710
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are certainly predators on the,</v>

568
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:37.970
<v Speaker 1>on the Internet that are waiting for you</v>
<v Speaker 1>at pretty much any moment to slip up.</v>

569
00:27:37.971 --> 00:27:38.804
<v Speaker 1>And like the idea that the world is full</v>
<v Speaker 1>of monstrous embodied forces that have </v>

570
00:27:42.921 --> 00:27:45.590
<v Speaker 1>you as target for pray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

571
00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.750
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

572
00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:49.880
<v Speaker 1>Obviously that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

573
00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:01.520
<v Speaker 1>so Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud's theory of dreams was essentially</v>

574
00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:05.270
<v Speaker 1>that there was a little late and content</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the dream,</v>

575
00:28:05.271 --> 00:28:06.104
<v Speaker 1>which is what the dream really meant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the layers of weird </v>

576
00:28:09.411 --> 00:28:10.244
<v Speaker 1>transformation of the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought about displacement where one </v>

577
00:28:13.071 --> 00:28:13.904
<v Speaker 1>thing would stand for another or </v>
<v Speaker 1>condensation where a lot of the events </v>

578
00:28:16.191 --> 00:28:19.970
<v Speaker 1>would be rammed together in a very short</v>
<v Speaker 1>sequence or symbolization.</v>

579
00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:20.983
<v Speaker 1>So like the mouse in my client's phobia </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be a good example of </v>

580
00:28:24.591 --> 00:28:26.210
<v Speaker 1>symbolization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of fear,</v>

581
00:28:26.211 --> 00:28:31.211
<v Speaker 1>of sexual penetration and dramatization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought of those is all ways that the</v>

582
00:28:31.221 --> 00:28:36.221
<v Speaker 1>dream was hiding the latent content from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dreamer in order to protect sleep.</v>

583
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.903
<v Speaker 1>Whereas you young and Freud really </v>
<v Speaker 1>argued about this and it's part of what </v>

584
00:28:40.161 --> 00:28:41.390
<v Speaker 1>broke them apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Young said,</v>

585
00:28:41.391 --> 00:28:41.691
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

586
00:28:41.691 --> 00:28:42.524
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

587
00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:45.470
<v Speaker 1>that might be right in some cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but generally what the dream is doing,</v>

588
00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:46.970
<v Speaker 1>it's just a fact of nature.</v>

589
00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:48.043
<v Speaker 1>The dream is trying to think something </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and so it might be concentrating on </v>

590
00:28:51.981 --> 00:28:54.290
<v Speaker 1>something that you refuse to admit to </v>
<v Speaker 1>and repressed,</v>

591
00:28:54.291 --> 00:28:58.040
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes it's just like out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>with free play at fantasy,</v>

592
00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:00.140
<v Speaker 1>trying to generally orient you in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

593
00:29:00.141 --> 00:29:00.974
<v Speaker 1>So he thought about it and you'll also </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought it's like young was an </v>

594
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:05.990
<v Speaker 1>archeologist of the Ed in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

595
00:29:05.991 --> 00:29:06.824
<v Speaker 1>he thought of the Ed as a much as a more</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative place in some sense than than </v>

596
00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:11.863
<v Speaker 1>Freud did and as the place where new </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas and new adaptive patterns were </v>

597
00:29:15.171 --> 00:29:16.004
<v Speaker 1>born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he believed that the dream was </v>

598
00:29:18.771 --> 00:29:19.604
<v Speaker 1>generally fairly logical and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things you did when you recounted the </v>

599
00:29:23.361 --> 00:29:24.194
<v Speaker 1>dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how accurately you tried to </v>

600
00:29:25.341 --> 00:29:26.174
<v Speaker 1>recount it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was to transform it into more of a </v>

601
00:29:28.941 --> 00:29:31.430
<v Speaker 1>narrative form than it actually took as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a dream.</v>

602
00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:35.540
<v Speaker 1>And so no doubt that's true because when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you describe an experience,</v>

603
00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:37.550
<v Speaker 1>even if it's an experience you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>every day,</v>

604
00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:40.760
<v Speaker 1>you basically extract out the gist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then describe the.</v>

605
00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:42.123
<v Speaker 1>And you have to do the same thing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams because you can't present the </v>

606
00:29:44.051 --> 00:29:47.710
<v Speaker 1>images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it might that just the act of telling</v>

607
00:29:47.711 --> 00:29:49.720
<v Speaker 1>the dream might even be useful in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

608
00:29:49.721 --> 00:29:50.554
<v Speaker 1>Because what you're doing is making </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that thought is more coherent </v>

609
00:29:53.561 --> 00:29:55.540
<v Speaker 1>than it would otherwise be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

610
00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:03.210
<v Speaker 1>So I want to run through this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this psychosexual theory very rapidly,</v>

611
00:30:03.211 --> 00:30:07.050
<v Speaker 1>and then I want to show you some </v>
<v Speaker 1>examples of it so you don't believe that</v>

612
00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:07.973
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you had a primary energy and </v>

613
00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:13.080
<v Speaker 1>that psychic energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we call energy.</v>

614
00:30:13.081 --> 00:30:13.914
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say I'm feeling energetic </v>

615
00:30:14.881 --> 00:30:16.830
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not obvious what that means,</v>

616
00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:17.693
<v Speaker 1>but Freud regarded that as libidinal and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thought that there were multiple </v>

617
00:30:21.601 --> 00:30:22.434
<v Speaker 1>sources of libido,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the most fundamental source with </v>

618
00:30:24.301 --> 00:30:25.134
<v Speaker 1>sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think he thought that in part </v>

619
00:30:26.701 --> 00:30:28.590
<v Speaker 1>because of the influence of Darwin's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>

620
00:30:28.591 --> 00:30:29.424
<v Speaker 1>because Darwin basically said that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal of organisms was essentially to </v>

621
00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:33.743
<v Speaker 1>procreate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sexual urge is extraordinarily </v>

622
00:30:36.241 --> 00:30:37.074
<v Speaker 1>strong and so he thought it was primary </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can make a reasonable case that </v>

623
00:30:42.211 --> 00:30:43.044
<v Speaker 1>it's primary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's too reductionistic </v>

624
00:30:44.461 --> 00:30:45.294
<v Speaker 1>because there's lots of drives that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have and it isn't obvious that </v>

625
00:30:48.241 --> 00:30:51.870
<v Speaker 1>they all coagulate into a single source </v>
<v Speaker 1>of energy.</v>

626
00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:52.853
<v Speaker 1>Somewhere in the psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the way the brain is </v>

627
00:30:55.411 --> 00:30:56.244
<v Speaker 1>structured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually the part of the brain that </v>

628
00:30:57.661 --> 00:30:58.494
<v Speaker 1>wakes you up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called the reticular activating </v>

629
00:30:59.731 --> 00:31:00.920
<v Speaker 1>system and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

630
00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:03.940
<v Speaker 1>it's some strands way down in the brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>stem that,</v>

631
00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:07.890
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that branch out in a Mo in many,</v>

632
00:31:07.891 --> 00:31:10.530
<v Speaker 1>many ways out into the brain like a tree</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>

633
00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:13.740
<v Speaker 1>if you twist your head the wrong way </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have a car accident,</v>

634
00:31:13.741 --> 00:31:14.574
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you can shear off those tracks</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you're in a coma and there's </v>

635
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:18.263
<v Speaker 1>nothing that can be done about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reticular activating system is </v>

636
00:31:20.881 --> 00:31:22.140
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really old.</v>

637
00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:26.190
<v Speaker 1>I could seems older than all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation and emotional systems,</v>

638
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:27.263
<v Speaker 1>and so if there is a libido,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be whatever it is that the </v>

639
00:31:31.291 --> 00:31:35.740
<v Speaker 1>reticular activating system does in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to awaken you from your slumber,</v>

640
00:31:35.741 --> 00:31:36.574
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or to put you on alert when something </v>

641
00:31:37.501 --> 00:31:40.710
<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like it's older than all the.</v>

642
00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:45.030
<v Speaker 1>The isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational and emotional systems.</v>

643
00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:48.340
<v Speaker 1>So the libido per se,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't sexual by,</v>

644
00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:52.530
<v Speaker 1>by all appearances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something that's below sexuality.</v>

645
00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:53.903
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

646
00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:55.643
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still reasonable to note that </v>

647
00:31:56.611 --> 00:31:59.490
<v Speaker 1>sexuality is a powerful driving force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

648
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Freud said it begins its development in </v>
<v Speaker 1>infancy.</v>

649
00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:04.783
<v Speaker 1>The infant is a sexual being by which he</v>
<v Speaker 1>meant the infant is capable of </v>

650
00:32:07.311 --> 00:32:09.830
<v Speaker 1>experiencing sexual pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why not,</v>

651
00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:10.673
<v Speaker 1>I should let you know that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>practices of Victoria nurses with male </v>

652
00:32:13.281 --> 00:32:18.050
<v Speaker 1>babies was to masturbate them till they </v>
<v Speaker 1>till satiation so they would sleep.</v>

653
00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:20.210
<v Speaker 1>So it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's there,</v>

654
00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:23.070
<v Speaker 1>it's not like there's no evidence for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual pleasure in,</v>

655
00:32:23.071 --> 00:32:24.200
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in children,</v>

656
00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:25.363
<v Speaker 1>in infants in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud thought about that as </v>

657
00:32:27.231 --> 00:32:28.064
<v Speaker 1>polymorphously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perverse by which he meant that the </v>

658
00:32:29.781 --> 00:32:32.210
<v Speaker 1>infant was willing to take pleasure in </v>
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

659
00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:33.373
<v Speaker 1>in any activity whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and babies can have some pretty messy </v>

660
00:32:36.081 --> 00:32:36.914
<v Speaker 1>habits without any structuring of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that that channeled in various </v>

661
00:32:40.221 --> 00:32:41.720
<v Speaker 1>ways as the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the,</v>

662
00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:44.210
<v Speaker 1>as the baby developed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>

663
00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:46.820
<v Speaker 1>here are his stages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the aural period.</v>

664
00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:47.983
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite interesting that when a baby </v>

665
00:32:48.981 --> 00:32:49.814
<v Speaker 1>is born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the part of its body that is in fact </v>

666
00:32:52.071 --> 00:32:52.904
<v Speaker 1>most mature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most like a mature part in terms of its </v>

667
00:32:55.461 --> 00:32:59.090
<v Speaker 1>eventual function is in fact the mouth </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the tongue and obvious.</v>

668
00:32:59.090 --> 00:32:59.923
<v Speaker 1>There's obvious reasons for that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the baby has to be able to latch onto </v>

669
00:33:02.421 --> 00:33:04.430
<v Speaker 1>the nipple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know right away.</v>

670
00:33:04.431 --> 00:33:06.650
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually quite a complicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity.</v>

671
00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:07.484
<v Speaker 1>It's a complicated social activity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it requires a fair bit of coordination </v>

672
00:33:10.911 --> 00:33:13.550
<v Speaker 1>between the baby and the mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not something automatic.</v>

673
00:33:13.551 --> 00:33:15.400
<v Speaker 1>So if the baby didn't come out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

674
00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:16.443
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wired up for certain basic in certain </v>

675
00:33:19.311 --> 00:33:22.340
<v Speaker 1>basic ways it wouldn't be able to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to begin with.</v>

676
00:33:22.341 --> 00:33:24.620
<v Speaker 1>So it's definitely wired up in an oral </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>

677
00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:28.760
<v Speaker 1>So he thought if the oral character as </v>
<v Speaker 1>passive optimistic independent,</v>

678
00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:33.740
<v Speaker 1>and there's the anal period where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud thought that's where the ego,</v>

679
00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:34.793
<v Speaker 1>the Super Ego for the first time in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense where the child has had to </v>

680
00:33:37.161 --> 00:33:37.994
<v Speaker 1>renounce primary pleasure and so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be the pleasure of dedication </v>

681
00:33:41.301 --> 00:33:42.134
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally in favor of a more complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>form of behavior and that that was </v>

682
00:33:45.951 --> 00:33:46.784
<v Speaker 1>actually an inhibitory process and </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly the case that parents can get </v>

683
00:33:50.121 --> 00:33:53.750
<v Speaker 1>into like year long wars with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with kids over toilet training,</v>

684
00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:54.530
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

685
00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:57.200
<v Speaker 1>So I've seen some pretty weird examples </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

686
00:33:57.201 --> 00:33:59.540
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw one parent who,</v>

687
00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:02.780
<v Speaker 1>who was in such a war with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their three year old,</v>

688
00:34:02.781 --> 00:34:03.614
<v Speaker 1>that that three year old would only </v>
<v Speaker 1>dedicate if the mother put a diaper on </v>

689
00:34:07.081 --> 00:34:08.720
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it had perfect control,</v>

690
00:34:08.721 --> 00:34:10.730
<v Speaker 1>but it was like there was a war going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

691
00:34:10.731 --> 00:34:11.564
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he thought of anal people as </v>

692
00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:15.380
<v Speaker 1>orderly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parsimonious,</v>

693
00:34:15.381 --> 00:34:17.210
<v Speaker 1>and obstinate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of interesting too,</v>

694
00:34:17.211 --> 00:34:18.044
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that we found </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently is that conscientiousness is </v>

695
00:34:21.051 --> 00:34:22.490
<v Speaker 1>one of the big five traits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

696
00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:27.760
<v Speaker 1>You can break it into orderliness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>into industriousness and orderliness,</v>

697
00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:29.293
<v Speaker 1>predicts conservatism and predicts </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism and it's associated </v>

698
00:34:33.231 --> 00:34:35.720
<v Speaker 1>with disgust sensitivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought,</v>

699
00:34:35.721 --> 00:34:37.010
<v Speaker 1>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty interesting.</v>

700
00:34:37.011 --> 00:34:37.844
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's also the other thing that's </v>

701
00:34:38.901 --> 00:34:39.734
<v Speaker 1>really cool about orderliness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>disgust sensitivity is that it is </v>

702
00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:48.770
<v Speaker 1>associated with disgust associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that would contaminate.</v>

703
00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:53.360
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that that's associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense with,</v>

704
00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:55.880
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with anal thinking is</v>

705
00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:00.470
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about it that's right.</v>

706
00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:01.573
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's also pretty important to note </v>

707
00:35:02.451 --> 00:35:05.450
<v Speaker 1>that the reason that all you people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to live to be 90 or thereabouts,</v>

708
00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:09.290
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't doctors and it's plumbers.</v>

709
00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.720
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

710
00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

711
00:35:13.461 --> 00:35:14.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

712
00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.690
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

713
00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:16.643
<v Speaker 1>the life is in itself contaminating and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a built in system that's the </v>

714
00:35:21.231 --> 00:35:23.330
<v Speaker 1>disgust system to take care of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

715
00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.313
<v Speaker 1>And it's clear that that does vary in </v>
<v Speaker 1>strength between individuals and it's </v>

716
00:35:27.561 --> 00:35:32.300
<v Speaker 1>also clear that the degree to which that</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a stronger disgust system,</v>

717
00:35:32.301 --> 00:35:35.510
<v Speaker 1>you're much more likely to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative in your political beliefs.</v>

718
00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:38.160
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not something obvious.</v>

719
00:35:38.161 --> 00:35:39.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Phallic period,</v>

720
00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:43.830
<v Speaker 1>three to five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when Freud believed that children</v>

721
00:35:43.831 --> 00:35:44.664
<v Speaker 1>often discovered masturbation and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>when girls develop penis envy and boys </v>

722
00:35:49.011 --> 00:35:52.290
<v Speaker 1>develop castration anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I said is a small price to pay for</v>

723
00:35:52.291 --> 00:35:54.510
<v Speaker 1>the possession of a penis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

724
00:35:54.511 --> 00:35:55.344
<v Speaker 1>So all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a way of thinking about the </v>

725
00:35:58.210 --> 00:35:59.043
<v Speaker 1>depaul phase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's basically hostility and erotic </v>

726
00:36:03.361 --> 00:36:04.194
<v Speaker 1>attraction towards the parents now for </v>
<v Speaker 1>and thought about this as a normative </v>

727
00:36:08.641 --> 00:36:09.570
<v Speaker 1>part of development.</v>

728
00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:13.150
<v Speaker 2>And</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a tough one.</v>

729
00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:15.563
<v Speaker 1>It certainly does seem to be the case </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there is some experimental evidence </v>

730
00:36:17.911 --> 00:36:19.410
<v Speaker 1>that boys</v>

731
00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:25.080
<v Speaker 1>fight more with their fathers and girls </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight more with their mothers.</v>

732
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:26.783
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think I not so sure that the idea </v>

733
00:36:30.061 --> 00:36:32.790
<v Speaker 1>that this is normative development is </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly right.</v>

734
00:36:32.791 --> 00:36:33.624
<v Speaker 1>And maybe maybe Freud got skewed over a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit because he was always dealing with </v>

735
00:36:36.331 --> 00:36:38.430
<v Speaker 1>people who had one form of pathology or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

736
00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:39.803
<v Speaker 1>Now here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's how to develop an equitable </v>

737
00:36:41.011 --> 00:36:43.950
<v Speaker 1>situation if you want to with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

738
00:36:43.951 --> 00:36:44.784
<v Speaker 1>Some of you will take this road so maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>this will help you do it better if </v>

739
00:36:47.551 --> 00:36:48.384
<v Speaker 1>that's really what you're into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the thing to do is make sure that </v>

740
00:36:51.211 --> 00:36:52.044
<v Speaker 1>your marriage is quite hostile so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a lot of underlying resentment </v>

741
00:36:55.501 --> 00:36:59.820
<v Speaker 1>to your partner and that will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will encourage you to suddenly turn</v>

742
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:00.863
<v Speaker 1>one of your children or more of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>against that parent without them really </v>

743
00:37:04.021 --> 00:37:04.854
<v Speaker 1>knowing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can do that by covertly </v>

744
00:37:06.211 --> 00:37:09.120
<v Speaker 1>reinforcing them when they do that or </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignoring them,</v>

745
00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:11.310
<v Speaker 1>that's even better when they do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite.</v>

746
00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:14.370
<v Speaker 1>So you know maybe your daughter is being</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice to your husband,</v>

747
00:37:14.371 --> 00:37:15.204
<v Speaker 1>you're already mad at him so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know you make it known to her using one </v>

748
00:37:18.961 --> 00:37:22.050
<v Speaker 1>strategy or another that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really approve of that sort of behavior.</v>

749
00:37:22.051 --> 00:37:23.640
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty effective way of doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

750
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Then the next thing to do is this works </v>
<v Speaker 1>really well.</v>

751
00:37:27.091 --> 00:37:28.620
<v Speaker 1>If you have a young boy and you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

752
00:37:28.621 --> 00:37:30.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wanna,</v>

753
00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:33.060
<v Speaker 1>you wanna develop a lot of hostility </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards your husband so you really don't</v>

754
00:37:33.061 --> 00:37:33.894
<v Speaker 1>want to have anything to do with them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't really want him to even </v>

755
00:37:35.521 --> 00:37:39.150
<v Speaker 1>touch you and because of that you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>even really all that happy about men.</v>

756
00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:40.433
<v Speaker 1>And so then you do two things is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you turn to your son because he's kind </v>

757
00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:44.393
<v Speaker 1>of harmless and you make your </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship way closer than it should </v>

758
00:37:47.821 --> 00:37:51.480
<v Speaker 1>be with him and you encourage all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of things that are really kind of on the</v>

759
00:37:51.481 --> 00:37:56.481
<v Speaker 1>edge of acceptable behavior and at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same time you repress and crush any part</v>

760
00:37:56.791 --> 00:37:57.624
<v Speaker 1>of him that would develop in the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>masculinity that would enable him to </v>

761
00:38:00.691 --> 00:38:03.360
<v Speaker 1>turn into the monster that you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>your husband is.</v>

762
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:07.050
<v Speaker 1>So that's a really effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people can do that for like 20 years</v>

763
00:38:07.051 --> 00:38:08.430
<v Speaker 1>and outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that.</v>

764
00:38:08.431 --> 00:38:10.650
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of business as a therapist </v>
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

765
00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:14.430
<v Speaker 1>I do see this sort of thing and a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

766
00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:18.480
<v Speaker 1>A lot of what happens in therapy is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting thing is people come</v>

767
00:38:18.481 --> 00:38:20.370
<v Speaker 1>to see me to solve all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

768
00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.233
<v Speaker 1>like have a very large number of sorts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the common problems is they </v>

769
00:38:25.711 --> 00:38:29.400
<v Speaker 1>cannot get away from their families.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't,</v>

770
00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:33.240
<v Speaker 1>they can't break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those initial isn't even break them.</v>

771
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 1>The family can't negotiate a to allow</v>

772
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.940
<v Speaker 3>the person to manifest the independence </v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be necessary for them to have</v>

773
00:38:39.941 --> 00:38:42.640
<v Speaker 3>their own life and their own family and </v>
<v Speaker 3>their own career.</v>

774
00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:46.450
<v Speaker 3>And so they're struggling and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>caught in these often ugly nets,</v>

775
00:38:46.451 --> 00:38:49.960
<v Speaker 3>like often unbelievably ugly nets and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't get out of them.</v>

776
00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:51.700
<v Speaker 3>And that's what we're going to see right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

777
00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:57.900
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>now this character Robert Crumb,</v>

778
00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.360
<v Speaker 3>he's quite the character and we should </v>
<v Speaker 3>turn those lights down.</v>

779
00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:07.323
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's good.</v>

780
00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:08.713
<v Speaker 3>Maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can do a voiceover and this later so </v>

781
00:39:12.231 --> 00:39:15.980
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't really matter if we have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's do that.</v>

782
00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:22.173
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Robert Crumb was an underground </v>

783
00:39:23.081 --> 00:39:23.914
<v Speaker 3>cartoonist is an underground cartoonist </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he lived in Berkeley in the late </v>

784
00:39:26.141 --> 00:39:26.974
<v Speaker 3>sixties and this documentary was made </v>
<v Speaker 3>about him and his family and so I'm </v>

785
00:39:30.011 --> 00:39:30.844
<v Speaker 3>going to get you to watch as much of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>as we can watch and maybe I'll show you </v>

786
00:39:33.611 --> 00:39:37.030
<v Speaker 3>a bit more in the next class so I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to because we're supposed to do</v>

787
00:39:37.031 --> 00:39:38.350
<v Speaker 3>something else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I might anyways.</v>

788
00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:39.633
<v Speaker 3>Now this film,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love this film for a variety of </v>

789
00:39:42.431 --> 00:39:43.121
<v Speaker 3>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

790
00:39:43.121 --> 00:39:45.130
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a work of genius.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Second,</v>

791
00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:46.293
<v Speaker 3>I've never ever seen any film of any </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort that does as good a job of </v>

792
00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:50.673
<v Speaker 3>illustrating not only what Freudian </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychopathology is and how it manifests </v>

793
00:39:54.521 --> 00:39:58.600
<v Speaker 3>itself symbolically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also how the family plays into it.</v>

794
00:39:58.601 --> 00:40:00.460
<v Speaker 3>So away we go</v>

795
00:41:57.030 --> 00:42:02.030
<v Speaker 4>me</v>
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>

796
00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:36.750
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's what happened.</v>

797
00:42:36.751 --> 00:42:37.584
<v Speaker 3>The film crew wants to go to his house </v>
<v Speaker 3>where his brothers still lives and film </v>

798
00:42:41.851 --> 00:42:42.684
<v Speaker 3>his brother Charles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's lived there since he was 55 and </v>

799
00:42:45.031 --> 00:42:46.560
<v Speaker 3>he's lived there since he was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>teenager.</v>

800
00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:49.830
<v Speaker 3>And you notice how Robert uses a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>soft voice.</v>

801
00:42:49.831 --> 00:42:52.380
<v Speaker 3>He's talking to his mother and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got a whole.</v>

802
00:42:52.381 --> 00:42:53.214
<v Speaker 3>He's a famous guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a whole film crew there and </v>

803
00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:55.733
<v Speaker 3>he's basically asking his mother if it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay if he brings his friends over and </v>

804
00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:00.300
<v Speaker 3>she basically says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

805
00:43:00.301 --> 00:43:01.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that would be such a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea,</v>

806
00:43:01.921 --> 00:43:02.754
<v Speaker 3>and he backs off right away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when he gets off the phone he </v>

807
00:43:04.891 --> 00:43:05.341
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

808
00:43:05.341 --> 00:43:06.031
<v Speaker 3>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

809
00:43:06.031 --> 00:43:06.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

810
00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:08.760
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

811
00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:11.573
<v Speaker 3>That's if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have a good snake detector </v>

812
00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:16.870
<v Speaker 3>working and you're listening and </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching closely,</v>

813
00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:18.003
<v Speaker 3>you know that there are a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of snakes under the surface </v>

814
00:43:20.261 --> 00:43:21.094
<v Speaker 3>already.</v>

815
00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:42.230
<v Speaker 4>The soul of people</v>
<v Speaker 4>expressing their connection to eternity,</v>

816
00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:50.680
<v Speaker 4>whatever you want to call it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>modern doesn't have lost that.</v>

817
00:43:50.681 --> 00:43:52.760
<v Speaker 4>People can express themselves that way </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

818
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:54.703
<v Speaker 3>So that's a very paradoxical set of </v>
<v Speaker 3>statements because on the one hand he's </v>

819
00:43:57.441 --> 00:44:00.290
<v Speaker 3>expressing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he says he really loves old music and he</v>

820
00:44:00.291 --> 00:44:03.410
<v Speaker 3>loves it because he can hear the soul of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the common man being expressed.</v>

821
00:44:03.411 --> 00:44:08.210
<v Speaker 3>But then he takes like a pot shot at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>entire world of music since 1920,</v>

822
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:11.900
<v Speaker 3>which indicates a tremendous amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of implicit arrogance.</v>

823
00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:15.770
<v Speaker 3>And he also says that's the only time </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he feels any love for humanity.</v>

824
00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:16.761
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

825
00:44:16.761 --> 00:44:17.594
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure that his attitude towards </v>

826
00:44:20.001 --> 00:44:22.850
<v Speaker 3>humanity as a whole is actually all that</v>
<v Speaker 3>relevant.</v>

827
00:44:22.851 --> 00:44:24.020
<v Speaker 3>And second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

828
00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:24.943
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've put yourself in the position </v>

829
00:44:26.571 --> 00:44:30.050
<v Speaker 3>where you regard yourself as a credible </v>
<v Speaker 3>judge of humanity,</v>

830
00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 3>it's like you might want to take a few </v>
<v Speaker 3>steps</v>

831
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:33.690
<v Speaker 1>back from your narcissism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

832
00:44:33.691 --> 00:44:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Right then and there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

833
00:44:35.461 --> 00:44:37.320
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not kidding about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you,</v>

834
00:44:37.321 --> 00:44:39.540
<v Speaker 1>those kids who showed up at Columbine </v>
<v Speaker 1>high school,</v>

835
00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:41.573
<v Speaker 1>they had their motivations and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote them down and they knew exactly </v>

836
00:44:43.651 --> 00:44:46.680
<v Speaker 1>what they were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the leader who was the more literary</v>

837
00:44:46.681 --> 00:44:50.160
<v Speaker 1>of the two said quite explicitly that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the judge of the human race.</v>

838
00:44:50.161 --> 00:44:53.850
<v Speaker 1>And as far as he was concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't pass his judgment and that you</v>

839
00:44:53.851 --> 00:44:56.910
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was perfectly reasonable for him</v>

840
00:44:56.911 --> 00:44:59.190
<v Speaker 1>to go on a cleansing binge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

841
00:44:59.191 --> 00:45:00.024
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he didn't just want to shoot up a </v>

842
00:45:01.051 --> 00:45:01.650
<v Speaker 1>whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

843
00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:02.483
<v Speaker 1>a few students in the school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had bombs planted all over the </v>

844
00:45:04.771 --> 00:45:05.604
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted a whole apocalyptic scene and </v>

845
00:45:07.291 --> 00:45:09.180
<v Speaker 1>they had dreamed about blowing up </v>
<v Speaker 1>Detroit.</v>

846
00:45:09.181 --> 00:45:10.014
<v Speaker 1>And so you could imagine what would </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen if someone like him got their </v>

847
00:45:12.301 --> 00:45:14.670
<v Speaker 1>finger on the button of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

848
00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:18.120
<v Speaker 1>of a hydrogen bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

849
00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:20.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young said,</v>

850
00:45:20.581 --> 00:45:23.010
<v Speaker 1>if you go deep enough into the shadow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find hell.</v>

851
00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:24.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly right.</v>

852
00:45:24.751 --> 00:45:25.800
<v Speaker 1>And it's no joke.</v>

853
00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:06.790
<v Speaker 3>This is mom's house.</v>

854
00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:12.750
<v Speaker 4>Do you read any good books lately?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just</v>

855
00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:19.600
<v Speaker 4>kind of like recycling a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>books,</v>

856
00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:21.313
<v Speaker 4>recycling.</v>

857
00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:24.420
<v Speaker 3>They've got a very interesting voice </v>
<v Speaker 3>tone,</v>

858
00:48:24.421 --> 00:48:26.100
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you might pick up on as well.</v>

859
00:48:26.101 --> 00:48:29.370
<v Speaker 3>It's very ironic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like everything they say is ironic.</v>

860
00:48:29.371 --> 00:48:30.204
<v Speaker 3>Scott,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this kind of bitter and arrogant twist </v>

861
00:48:31.411 --> 00:48:32.244
<v Speaker 3>in it and they're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely catastrophic things like </v>

862
00:48:35.371 --> 00:48:39.900
<v Speaker 3>nightmarishly catastrophic things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yet there's this sort of adolescent like</v>

863
00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:42.060
<v Speaker 3>banter and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and laughter about it</v>

864
00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:46.100
<v Speaker 4>when you were reading all year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 years ago,</v>

865
00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:52.200
<v Speaker 4>do that</v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's nothing else</v>

866
00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:59.730
<v Speaker 4>you ever read anything new.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really recent writers</v>

867
00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:09.990
<v Speaker 4>I'm interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of them</v>

868
00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:17.190
<v Speaker 4>are not nearly as interesting as the old</v>
<v Speaker 4>lady,</v>

869
00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:21.213
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freud would say here that there's an </v>

870
00:49:22.991 --> 00:49:26.140
<v Speaker 3>awful lot of intellectual ization going </v>
<v Speaker 3>on and there definitely is.</v>

871
00:49:26.141 --> 00:49:26.974
<v Speaker 3>So these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these guys are very divorced from their </v>

872
00:49:28.451 --> 00:49:30.220
<v Speaker 3>bodies and they have every reason to be</v>

873
00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:42.183
<v Speaker 4>books.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Charles is the one that started this </v>

874
00:49:50.311 --> 00:49:54.300
<v Speaker 4>whole comic thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was completely obsessed with comics.</v>

875
00:49:54.330 --> 00:49:57.600
<v Speaker 4>We are kids had absolutely no other </v>
<v Speaker 4>normal kid.</v>

876
00:49:57.601 --> 00:49:58.434
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't interested in toys or games in </v>

877
00:50:00.721 --> 00:50:01.560
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Scores,</v>

878
00:50:01.561 --> 00:50:05.360
<v Speaker 4>didn't do anything but read comics for </v>
<v Speaker 4>all comics thing.</v>

879
00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:06.263
<v Speaker 4>Come and talk and the drawing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other drawing interest besides the </v>

880
00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:12.263
<v Speaker 4>control realistic scenes and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just pictures of buildings and cars and </v>

881
00:50:17.301 --> 00:50:19.110
<v Speaker 4>stuff was interested in that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's only</v>

882
00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:25.640
<v Speaker 4>the earliest one that is still existed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had as Charles through this one that's</v>

883
00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:27.353
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

884
00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:30.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you hear that laugh.</v>

885
00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:31.993
<v Speaker 3>It's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the situation they're in is </v>

886
00:50:35.461 --> 00:50:36.294
<v Speaker 3>adults and Charles could see that coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he had all sorts of homicidal </v>

887
00:50:40.201 --> 00:50:41.034
<v Speaker 3>fantasies about.</v>

888
00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:42.593
<v Speaker 4>How about Robert?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was unconsciously imitating when I </v>

889
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:08.583
<v Speaker 4>forced you draw comic books.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's still a kind of sibling rivalry </v>

890
00:51:13.901 --> 00:51:18.901
<v Speaker 4>going on between the me and the kids and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was still living in</v>

891
00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:24.100
<v Speaker 4>basically the wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're still competing with each other.</v>

892
00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:28.090
<v Speaker 4>Drug products.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still think of Charles approval</v>

893
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:32.230
<v Speaker 4>like Charles drawing come.</v>

894
00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:33.603
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what basically happened was Robert </v>

895
00:51:34.901 --> 00:51:36.820
<v Speaker 3>got the world and Charles God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his mother,</v>

896
00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:41.500
<v Speaker 3>so they both won,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have Charles I don't think is very</v>

897
00:51:41.501 --> 00:51:42.580
<v Speaker 3>happy with what he want</v>

898
00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:51.750
<v Speaker 4>tunes</v>
<v Speaker 4>where we sat around and talked about.</v>

899
00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:56.940
<v Speaker 4>I was usually the president,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vice president,</v>

900
00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:02.450
<v Speaker 4>secretary and saying that he was the </v>
<v Speaker 4>trailer</v>

901
00:52:08.890 --> 00:52:13.110
<v Speaker 4>to still.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He still resents the fact that we impose</v>

902
00:52:13.111 --> 00:52:14.800
<v Speaker 4>on the role of supply.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boy Them.</v>

903
00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:52.390
<v Speaker 4>Excellent was the scapegoat and</v>
<v Speaker 4>five kids.</v>

904
00:52:53.310 --> 00:52:54.143
<v Speaker 4>He was definitely the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ocean to explain is that we have these </v>

905
00:52:58.261 --> 00:53:03.261
<v Speaker 4>meetings for this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this Columbus Club,</v>

906
00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:08.940
<v Speaker 4>comics and Austin and bring out their </v>
<v Speaker 4>10th or different jobs or different like</v>

907
00:53:08.941 --> 00:53:11.800
<v Speaker 4>a secretary and prison or vice president</v>
<v Speaker 4>on our</v>

908
00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:19.610
<v Speaker 4>director Robert did or something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>seals.</v>

909
00:53:19.650 --> 00:53:22.350
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing is just like incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy,</v>

910
00:53:22.351 --> 00:53:23.184
<v Speaker 4>similar thing in me and Charles and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Robert have been slight little room </v>

911
00:53:25.501 --> 00:53:28.530
<v Speaker 4>upstairs in the whole rest of the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>to know what the fuck is going on,</v>

912
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:32.550
<v Speaker 4>so he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>working at it on the trees,</v>

913
00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:35.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just together</v>

914
00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:37.943
<v Speaker 4>in a closed situation</v>
<v Speaker 4>fired by the Disney movie where Robert </v>

915
00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:51.330
<v Speaker 4>Newton plays alone.</v>

916
00:53:51.330 --> 00:53:56.330
<v Speaker 4>John Silver in episode in 1955 when we </v>
<v Speaker 4>started like playing pirates here,</v>

917
00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:01.320
<v Speaker 4>like normal kids go out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretend you've made this shift,</v>

918
00:54:01.321 --> 00:54:02.154
<v Speaker 4>that little refrigerator cart and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything that Charles would walk </v>

919
00:54:06.421 --> 00:54:08.850
<v Speaker 4>around town dressed up like long John </v>
<v Speaker 4>Silver,</v>

920
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:13.260
<v Speaker 4>crystal coded my mother's as Long Green </v>
<v Speaker 4>Code and he made himself a three pointer</v>

921
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:14.103
<v Speaker 4>and has that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had a crutch and you tied with leg </v>

922
00:54:16.830 --> 00:54:17.663
<v Speaker 4>like go around town that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hadn't realized that years later </v>

923
00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:21.533
<v Speaker 4>fixated Charles really wasn't as </v>
<v Speaker 4>treasurer and then this thing done on </v>

924
00:54:24.351 --> 00:54:28.620
<v Speaker 4>the native art played aren't as bad as </v>
<v Speaker 4>the first six or seven years after that.</v>

925
00:54:28.621 --> 00:54:29.454
<v Speaker 4>We do these context about treasure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I became Israel Baroque elaborate thing </v>

926
00:54:33.961 --> 00:54:38.850
<v Speaker 4>way beyond the original Disney film.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was one of,</v>

927
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:41.910
<v Speaker 4>Charles is one of our two med,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

928
00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:44.250
<v Speaker 4>in which he would draw some of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>characters,</v>

929
00:54:44.251 --> 00:54:47.220
<v Speaker 4>knives are also interact with each </v>
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>

930
00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:48.173
<v Speaker 4>That was also a great school of </v>
<v Speaker 4>cartooning for me is having to come up </v>

931
00:54:52.651 --> 00:54:55.590
<v Speaker 4>with clever retorts to him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was.</v>

932
00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:58.380
<v Speaker 4>He's actually much cleaner and funnier </v>
<v Speaker 4>than I was.</v>

933
00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:00.940
<v Speaker 4>It actually got kind of tiresome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Buddy,</v>

934
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:03.090
<v Speaker 4>you know he had to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was in charge.</v>

935
00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:06.560
<v Speaker 4>Has very like definitely band from about</v>
<v Speaker 4>Charles was not.</v>

936
00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:07.433
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I think a lot of them do with </v>
<v Speaker 4>like overly morbid sensitivity to the </v>

937
00:55:10.711 --> 00:55:13.620
<v Speaker 4>guy or something too as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Assistant you have a natural affinity to</v>

938
00:55:13.621 --> 00:55:17.090
<v Speaker 4>get into your profit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Off of robbery course was someone in the</v>

939
00:55:17.130 --> 00:55:21.430
<v Speaker 4>middle man had this wind like </v>
<v Speaker 4>restricting and complex,</v>

940
00:55:21.450 --> 00:55:24.660
<v Speaker 4>like terrible selfconsciousness </v>
<v Speaker 4>restriction and me as a kid,</v>

941
00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:25.553
<v Speaker 4>I was like morbidly monster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My body like sex plate completely came </v>

942
00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:30.413
<v Speaker 4>time for me to become sexually like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>puberty or something like sex with </v>

943
00:55:34.990 --> 00:55:36.530
<v Speaker 4>nowhere near my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

944
00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:39.990
<v Speaker 4>Just put them to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like six so heavily repressed,</v>

945
00:55:39.991 --> 00:55:43.410
<v Speaker 4>which meant naturally editing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sneezers started to have a seizure,</v>

946
00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:46.270
<v Speaker 4>so this was like a point where your </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior becomes,</v>

947
00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:47.253
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to get into the whole sector </v>

948
00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:51.000
<v Speaker 4>versus normal up topic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

949
00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:52.073
<v Speaker 4>That's all I thought about when I was in</v>
<v Speaker 4>my late teens and early twenties in a </v>

950
00:55:54.481 --> 00:55:58.980
<v Speaker 4>sentence and I masturbated about four or</v>
<v Speaker 4>five times a week.</v>

951
00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:03.510
<v Speaker 4>How frequently did you ask anyone out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>My sexual desires.</v>

952
00:56:03.790 --> 00:56:06.800
<v Speaker 4>You did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I told him the other night.</v>

953
00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:11.960
<v Speaker 4>I can't even get any reception know </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's the one thing or maybe it's</v>

954
00:56:14.821 --> 00:56:15.654
<v Speaker 4>a combination of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's a combination of the </v>

955
00:56:17.701 --> 00:56:20.430
<v Speaker 4>medication and the lack of external </v>
<v Speaker 4>stimulation.</v>

956
00:56:20.650 --> 00:56:25.650
<v Speaker 4>Maybe approaching old age to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>something meaning any,</v>

957
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:29.590
<v Speaker 4>some external stimulation to keep up </v>
<v Speaker 4>your interest?</v>

958
00:56:29.830 --> 00:56:33.200
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that my sexual desires in that</v>

959
00:56:36.350 --> 00:56:41.350
<v Speaker 4>earliest sexual abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever actually,</v>

960
00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:45.560
<v Speaker 4>it will be like 40 years old and getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>directions.</v>

961
00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:50.970
<v Speaker 4>Here's my aunt or my older sister and </v>
<v Speaker 4>her legs and her shoes.</v>

962
00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:52.313
<v Speaker 4>Like I need a table instead of going </v>
<v Speaker 4>like mother's closet and she had these </v>

963
00:56:55.440 --> 00:57:00.270
<v Speaker 4>cowboy boots that she wore when it </v>
<v Speaker 4>rained and humping goes in the closet.</v>

964
00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:05.160
<v Speaker 4>I</v>
<v Speaker 4>already</v>

965
00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:11.780
<v Speaker 4>have</v>
<v Speaker 4>five or six.</v>

966
00:57:14.731 --> 00:57:18.590
<v Speaker 4>I was sexually attracted to bugs bunny </v>
<v Speaker 4>bunny,</v>

967
00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:19.853
<v Speaker 4>have to cover the chronic bucket to </v>
<v Speaker 4>carry the rail with my pocket to get </v>

968
00:57:24.810 --> 00:57:29.810
<v Speaker 4>looked at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>periodically wrinkled up and handling it</v>

969
00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:30.773
<v Speaker 4>so much that they asked me whether the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fire engine on the ironing board and </v>

970
00:57:33.751 --> 00:57:34.584
<v Speaker 4>flatten it out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and she did not as deeply as appointed </v>

971
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:38.520
<v Speaker 4>because it got old brown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When she died.</v>

972
00:57:38.570 --> 00:57:39.403
<v Speaker 4>It crumbled apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This sexual attraction to keep cartoon </v>

973
00:57:46.621 --> 00:57:51.120
<v Speaker 4>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You tell me</v>

974
00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:56.460
<v Speaker 4>I don't change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I turned 12,</v>

975
00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:06.280
<v Speaker 4>55,</v>
<v Speaker 4>56,</v>

976
00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:15.410
<v Speaker 4>totally obsessed with she lives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Went to bid.</v>

977
00:58:15.411 --> 00:58:17.900
<v Speaker 4>Are they of best things I wanted to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>with sheep.</v>

978
00:58:23.650 --> 00:58:27.580
<v Speaker 3>Now you see how how he conceptualizes </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself in relationship to her too,</v>

979
00:58:27.581 --> 00:58:28.414
<v Speaker 3>so he's like this while he's a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>smaller than she is and he's clearly </v>

980
00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:33.273
<v Speaker 3>depended on her physical strength and </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability and so he definitely </v>

981
00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:41.320
<v Speaker 3>conceptualized as himself as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>subordinate entities</v>

982
00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:48.070
<v Speaker 4>very hung up on</v>
<v Speaker 4>even more so.</v>

983
00:58:52.570 --> 00:58:57.370
<v Speaker 4>I think you were more shy</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually.</v>

984
00:58:57.900 --> 00:59:02.350
<v Speaker 4>I think you were more afraid of women </v>
<v Speaker 4>was as a young person</v>

985
00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:04.793
<v Speaker 4>in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a few dates with girls when you </v>

986
00:59:06.331 --> 00:59:07.164
<v Speaker 4>were in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you at all with anybody sort of good </v>

987
00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:14.350
<v Speaker 4>looking at everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Almost a handsome,</v>

988
00:59:14.351 --> 00:59:17.870
<v Speaker 4>good looking chaplains and teenager.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was just this.</v>

989
00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:23.100
<v Speaker 4>Something was wrong with my personality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>High school was an absolute nightmare.</v>

990
00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:29.990
<v Speaker 4>It was the most unpopular kid in high </v>
<v Speaker 4>school.</v>

991
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:36.190
<v Speaker 4>People were always taken on the the male</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the girls didn't have anything to do</v>

992
00:59:36.411 --> 00:59:40.120
<v Speaker 4>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They treated me like I was just there</v>

993
00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:42.553
<v Speaker 4>trip by my by predominantly women </v>
<v Speaker 4>starting with high school where I </v>

994
00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:48.093
<v Speaker 4>learned a lot about women because there </v>
<v Speaker 4>was this guy case Gutsche escape here </v>

995
00:59:51.850 --> 00:59:55.930
<v Speaker 4>with like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>mean bully,</v>

996
00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:59.770
<v Speaker 4>but he's also very charming and all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>girls liked him.</v>

997
01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:02.143
<v Speaker 4>The dream boat that was also bullied in </v>
<v Speaker 4>my brother Charles was one of the guys </v>

998
01:00:07.811 --> 01:00:08.644
<v Speaker 4>singled out for particular attention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you get this gang of flowing piece </v>

999
01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:18.220
<v Speaker 4>that had around with disguise Ganache,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so scene where they were special punches</v>

1000
01:00:19.451 --> 01:00:24.451
<v Speaker 4>up my brother in the hallway at school </v>
<v Speaker 4>sense I to see Charles gave up trying to</v>

1001
01:00:27.041 --> 01:00:29.100
<v Speaker 4>be popular or had girlfriends or </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

1002
01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:32.130
<v Speaker 4>If everybody saw that he could fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>back,</v>

1003
01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:33.760
<v Speaker 4>beat up by Scotch,</v>

1004
01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:34.913
<v Speaker 3>so that was probably enough to get his </v>
<v Speaker 3>depression going because it's a major </v>

1005
01:00:37.561 --> 01:00:38.520
<v Speaker 3>dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy,</v>

1006
01:00:38.521 --> 01:00:40.170
<v Speaker 3>defeat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was also an outcast,</v>

1007
01:00:40.171 --> 01:00:42.030
<v Speaker 3>so he's not even in the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy.</v>

1008
01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:43.133
<v Speaker 3>He was one of the class of boys by his </v>
<v Speaker 3>own account that was so contemptible </v>

1009
01:00:46.590 --> 01:00:47.423
<v Speaker 3>that he wasn't even in the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible date partners for any of the </v>

1010
01:00:52.081 --> 01:00:52.914
<v Speaker 3>girls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when you're thinking about why </v>

1011
01:00:53.851 --> 01:00:57.720
<v Speaker 3>Robert is dry drawing women with like </v>
<v Speaker 3>vicious bird heads,</v>

1012
01:00:57.900 --> 01:00:58.733
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that you might think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about is that for men at the bottom of </v>

1013
01:01:01.111 --> 01:01:01.944
<v Speaker 3>the dominance hierarchy or outside the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominance hierarchy completely like </v>

1014
01:01:04.471 --> 01:01:07.140
<v Speaker 3>these guys were all they ever got from </v>
<v Speaker 3>girls,</v>

1015
01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:11.100
<v Speaker 3>including their own mother was rejection</v>
<v Speaker 3>like harsh rejection.</v>

1016
01:01:11.310 --> 01:01:12.143
<v Speaker 3>And it was enough basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it was really in the final </v>

1017
01:01:14.101 --> 01:01:15.810
<v Speaker 3>analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was enough to kill Charles.</v>

1018
01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:16.793
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm not blaming the girls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm trying to explain why Robert is </v>

1019
01:01:21.241 --> 01:01:23.760
<v Speaker 3>expressing himself the way that he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>expressing himself.</v>

1020
01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:25.170
<v Speaker 3>Why these images come up?</v>

1021
01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:34.870
<v Speaker 4>You</v>
<v Speaker 4>gotta take</v>

1022
01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:41.200
<v Speaker 4>tranquilizers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That makes it a lot easier.</v>

1023
01:01:43.330 --> 01:01:44.163
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so Charles still has this kind of </v>

1024
01:01:45.301 --> 01:01:47.910
<v Speaker 3>dream in the back of his head too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really the image,</v>

1025
01:01:47.911 --> 01:01:52.320
<v Speaker 3>the idea that the Charles is living out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that Charles has it much easier</v>

1026
01:01:52.321 --> 01:01:53.154
<v Speaker 3>and much better than he does because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't really have to deal with the </v>

1027
01:01:55.321 --> 01:01:57.840
<v Speaker 3>world and he can just stay at home and </v>
<v Speaker 3>comfort with his mother.</v>

1028
01:01:57.841 --> 01:01:58.674
<v Speaker 3>It's like he's not in comfort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy he commits suicide six months </v>

1029
01:02:01.591 --> 01:02:03.090
<v Speaker 3>after this film</v>

1030
01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:12.953
<v Speaker 4>now</v>

1031
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:14.583
<v Speaker 3>that's extremely interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So young had this idea about </v>

1032
01:02:17.051 --> 01:02:18.090
<v Speaker 3>synchronicity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1033
01:02:18.130 --> 01:02:18.963
<v Speaker 3>he said now and then would happen in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world that we're connected weirdly </v>

1034
01:02:21.841 --> 01:02:22.674
<v Speaker 3>because of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an emotional contagion and it's a </v>

1035
01:02:25.921 --> 01:02:26.754
<v Speaker 3>very strange idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I wanted to show you an example of </v>

1036
01:02:28.531 --> 01:02:29.970
<v Speaker 3>it because it's actually caught on film </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

1037
01:02:29.971 --> 01:02:32.790
<v Speaker 3>So when Charles and Robert are talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about their mother,</v>

1038
01:02:32.791 --> 01:02:34.470
<v Speaker 3>you notice Charles Hunches right over </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1039
01:02:34.471 --> 01:02:35.304
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like even more inside than he </v>

1040
01:02:36.811 --> 01:02:37.644
<v Speaker 3>normally is and they turn into 2:13 year</v>
<v Speaker 3>old teenage boys talking upstairs so </v>

1041
01:02:41.521 --> 01:02:44.490
<v Speaker 3>their mother won't hear them as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 3>they mentioned her.</v>

1042
01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:46.200
<v Speaker 3>She pipes in.</v>

1043
01:03:08.490 --> 01:03:09.323
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1044
01:03:20.590 --> 01:03:22.780
<v Speaker 3>Now you see when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he did hear her,</v>

1045
01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:23.733
<v Speaker 3>she's complaining about the curtains </v>
<v Speaker 3>being closed with something in this </v>

1046
01:03:26.141 --> 01:03:28.590
<v Speaker 3>camera crew cluttering up your house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you know,</v>

1047
01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:29.463
<v Speaker 3>probably hasn't been cleaned since 1957.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not really that she matters that </v>

1048
01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:35.050
<v Speaker 3>she cares,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're there.</v>

1049
01:03:35.170 --> 01:03:37.780
<v Speaker 3>What she's doing is expressing her </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominance and it's.</v>

1050
01:03:38.050 --> 01:03:39.470
<v Speaker 3>And she does it in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1051
01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:42.940
<v Speaker 3>very subterranean way and Charles is </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely terrified of her.</v>

1052
01:04:03.030 --> 01:04:05.710
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't worry about it.</v>

1053
01:04:05.711 --> 01:04:07.960
<v Speaker 4>It's all going to be out here and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>be back to normal.</v>

1054
01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:17.570
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These girls talking about one difference</v>

1055
01:04:17.571 --> 01:04:19.750
<v Speaker 4>could a date.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's good.</v>

1056
01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:21.130
<v Speaker 4>She's envious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They all are.</v>

1057
01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:25.270
<v Speaker 4>This is how I still</v>
<v Speaker 4>bitter about</v>

1058
01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:27.773
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most teenage boys are very cool and </v>

1059
01:04:30.831 --> 01:04:31.664
<v Speaker 4>aggressive and everything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If girls would see that I was more kind </v>

1060
01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:35.293
<v Speaker 4>of insensitive things press,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I expect that I could draw but </v>

1061
01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.870
<v Speaker 4>couldn't understand why they liked these</v>
<v Speaker 4>cool,</v>

1062
01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:42.733
<v Speaker 4>aggressive guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not me because I was more kind and </v>

1063
01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:48.040
<v Speaker 4>sensitive and everything for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was more like him,</v>

1064
01:04:48.041 --> 01:04:50.180
<v Speaker 4>but he realized he didn't want him to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>like them.</v>

1065
01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:54.890
<v Speaker 4>Basically filtered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hurt and cruelly misunderstood because I</v>

1066
01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:56.900
<v Speaker 4>consider myself talented,</v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent.</v>

1067
01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:01.640
<v Speaker 4>It's not very attractive physically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think those things really mattered.</v>

1068
01:05:01.641 --> 01:05:02.474
<v Speaker 4>It was what's inside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I was 13 and 14 and trying to be </v>

1069
01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:09.080
<v Speaker 4>normal teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like a really ensured.</v>

1070
01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:10.870
<v Speaker 4>We just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tried to go.</v>

1071
01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.720
<v Speaker 4>Applicant thought they were acting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's raw and weird,</v>

1072
01:05:14.721 --> 01:05:15.554
<v Speaker 4>so then I just stopped completely and </v>
<v Speaker 4>just became a shadow and I wasn't even </v>

1073
01:05:19.691 --> 01:05:21.640
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People weren't even aware that it was,</v>

1074
01:05:22.010 --> 01:05:23.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

1075
01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:28.360
<v Speaker 4>in the same world they are in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That kind of freed me completely because</v>

1076
01:05:28.361 --> 01:05:30.250
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't under those pressures to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>normal.</v>

1077
01:05:30.251 --> 01:05:34.000
<v Speaker 4>So I got interested in old time music </v>
<v Speaker 4>and went to the black section of town,</v>

1078
01:05:34.001 --> 01:05:34.834
<v Speaker 4>knocking on doors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking for old records and things like </v>

1079
01:05:37.391 --> 01:05:39.400
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be unthinkable if you are going</v>

1080
01:05:39.401 --> 01:05:41.080
<v Speaker 4>to be a normal teenager.</v>

1081
01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:42.003
<v Speaker 3>So Robert can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>despite the fact that he grew up in a </v>

1082
01:05:44.411 --> 01:05:46.300
<v Speaker 3>family that was very difficult to escape</v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

1083
01:05:46.301 --> 01:05:48.270
<v Speaker 3>did follow his creative interests,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1084
01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.500
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he picked a path that was characteristic</v>

1085
01:05:50.501 --> 01:05:53.530
<v Speaker 3>of individuality and it did get 'em out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1086
01:05:53.531 --> 01:05:57.660
<v Speaker 3>he gave up on conformity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he found an alternative so you know,</v>

1087
01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:59.470
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty impressive and he did become</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

1088
01:05:59.650 --> 01:06:01.330
<v Speaker 3>very successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to show you,</v>

1089
01:06:01.331 --> 01:06:03.640
<v Speaker 3>I can't show you all of what I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 3>show you today,</v>

1090
01:06:03.641 --> 01:06:04.474
<v Speaker 3>but I do</v>

1091
01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:16.220
<v Speaker 4>forced me to answer that door and take </v>
<v Speaker 4>her outside you to put this girl's</v>

1092
01:06:18.350 --> 01:06:22.550
<v Speaker 4>armored personality line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chileans,</v>

1093
01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.880
<v Speaker 4>Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you got a good grade on a test.</v>

1094
01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:28.860
<v Speaker 4>Then you've got the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fascinating.</v>

1095
01:06:34.270 --> 01:06:37.510
<v Speaker 4>There is six weeks</v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

1096
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:43.820
<v Speaker 4>His other guy got to light jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hit you real art,</v>

1097
01:06:45.150 --> 01:06:45.983
<v Speaker 4>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Five years old at Christmas and this </v>

1098
01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:52.500
<v Speaker 4>whole thing happened during stack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pleasantly collarbone.</v>

1099
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:58.290
<v Speaker 4>Charles a pinching for getting in </v>
<v Speaker 4>trouble,</v>

1100
01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:00.413
<v Speaker 4>very diabolical as a Cuban.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I finally would like beat him </v>

1101
01:07:03.481 --> 01:07:07.110
<v Speaker 4>unmercifully for these things that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was always these crimes.</v>

1102
01:07:07.111 --> 01:07:09.840
<v Speaker 4>He was always convincing and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just made him worse.</v>

1103
01:07:09.841 --> 01:07:14.841
<v Speaker 4>I think the subconscious desire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1104
01:07:30.170 --> 01:07:34.610
<v Speaker 4>just this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1105
01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:35.593
<v Speaker 4>Here we go.</v>

1106
01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:43.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we've got 10 minutes here.</v>

1107
01:07:43.791 --> 01:07:44.624
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1108
01:07:53.850 --> 01:07:54.683
<v Speaker 4>they started being driven by that </v>
<v Speaker 4>session that I'll go down in history as </v>

1109
01:07:58.530 --> 01:08:03.030
<v Speaker 4>a great artist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That will be my revenge because my image</v>

1110
01:08:03.031 --> 01:08:03.864
<v Speaker 4>celebrating Valentine's Day 13th,</v>
<v Speaker 4>1962 when I decided to reject </v>

1111
01:08:09.121 --> 01:08:11.310
<v Speaker 4>conforming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when society rejected me,</v>

1112
01:08:11.490 --> 01:08:15.120
<v Speaker 4>I heard all that be yourselves to </v>
<v Speaker 4>myself.</v>

1113
01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:20.380
<v Speaker 4>Think I'm does not have to be satisfied </v>
<v Speaker 4>with cans and old records.</v>

1114
01:08:21.230 --> 01:08:25.730
<v Speaker 4>Girls are just utterly out reach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They won't even let me draw them</v>

1115
01:08:28.090 --> 01:08:33.090
<v Speaker 4>all that change after you get a famous I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was used to</v>

1116
01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:38.060
<v Speaker 4>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was really quite sweet.</v>

1117
01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:43.480
<v Speaker 4>And then he did this one that was just </v>
<v Speaker 4>incredibly hostile to women,</v>

1118
01:08:44.391 --> 01:08:46.460
<v Speaker 4>very sexual hostile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was,</v>

1119
01:08:46.850 --> 01:08:51.850
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't expecting it and it was really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was really shocked and taken aback and</v>

1120
01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:53.933
<v Speaker 4>really just kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard for me to believe that he can </v>

1121
01:08:57.470 --> 01:09:00.740
<v Speaker 4>just channel in sales doing or work.</v>

1122
01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:06.850
<v Speaker 5>I like a lot of his work and certainly </v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the lyrical aspect of it.</v>

1123
01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:09.590
<v Speaker 5>But then I find me something completely </v>
<v Speaker 5>different reaction,</v>

1124
01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:12.430
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>perhaps when I've been really turned off</v>

1125
01:09:12.490 --> 01:09:15.100
<v Speaker 5>and disgusted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

1126
01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:16.800
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

1127
01:09:16.890 --> 01:09:21.890
<v Speaker 5>this cartoon show blow is when I thought</v>
<v Speaker 5>about a lot of light.</v>

1128
01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:26.170
<v Speaker 5>On the one hand it's a satire of the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 5>fifties.</v>

1129
01:09:26.230 --> 01:09:27.063
<v Speaker 5>The healthy facade of the American </v>
<v Speaker 5>family and it kind of exposes the </v>

1130
01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:30.933
<v Speaker 5>sickness under the surface,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but at the same time you sense the </v>

1131
01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:41.870
<v Speaker 5>crumbs getting off on it himself and </v>
<v Speaker 5>some other way and on another level it's</v>

1132
01:09:42.001 --> 01:09:46.390
<v Speaker 5>an orange sheets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>self indulgent orgy in a fantasy.</v>

1133
01:09:46.391 --> 01:09:47.470
<v Speaker 5>And the fantasy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1134
01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:48.313
<v Speaker 5>specifically this story is a story about</v>
<v Speaker 5>a father who commands his daughter to </v>

1135
01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:54.333
<v Speaker 5>give a blow job and she does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then they wind up having sex and the </v>

1136
01:09:57.701 --> 01:09:58.534
<v Speaker 5>little sort of leave it to beaver type </v>
<v Speaker 5>brother character comes running in and </v>

1137
01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:04.060
<v Speaker 5>he's the father and his sister and he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>shocked and upset.</v>

1138
01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:04.893
<v Speaker 5>He goes running to the mother and tell </v>
<v Speaker 5>her and mom comes out of the closet </v>

1139
01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:12.040
<v Speaker 5>wearing sort of snm kind of get up and </v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

1140
01:10:12.570 --> 01:10:13.480
<v Speaker 5>oh cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1141
01:10:13.481 --> 01:10:17.920
<v Speaker 5>and the next thing my mom is sending the</v>
<v Speaker 5>whole panel ends.</v>

1142
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:20.380
<v Speaker 5>The whole cartoon is the parents saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gee,</v>

1143
01:10:20.381 --> 01:10:22.270
<v Speaker 5>we should spend more time with the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1144
01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:26.590
<v Speaker 5>so</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't,</v>

1145
01:10:26.591 --> 01:10:27.424
<v Speaker 5>you read something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think that it has gone over the </v>

1146
01:10:31.361 --> 01:10:36.361
<v Speaker 5>line from satire of a 19 fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hygienic,</v>

1147
01:10:37.570 --> 01:10:38.403
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>family and denial into something which </v>

1148
01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:43.353
<v Speaker 5>is just chrome producing pornography.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think this theme in his word is </v>

1149
01:10:47.741 --> 01:10:49.180
<v Speaker 5>omnipresent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's murder.</v>

1150
01:10:49.181 --> 01:10:51.420
<v Speaker 5>Been arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 5>juvenile position.</v>

1151
01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:11.950
<v Speaker 4>So the mother has these cute things </v>
<v Speaker 4>scattered everywhere.</v>

1152
01:11:19.670 --> 01:11:23.430
<v Speaker 4>We pulled it loose from each other for </v>
<v Speaker 4>the most part.</v>

1153
01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:28.560
<v Speaker 4>You spend all your time down here </v>
<v Speaker 4>watching television going across or</v>

1154
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:31.660
<v Speaker 4>I spend most of my tops</v>

1155
01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:36.170
<v Speaker 3>so you can see how well they communicate</v>

1156
01:11:40.210 --> 01:11:44.910
<v Speaker 4>resources living in this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you do,</v>

1157
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:47.410
<v Speaker 4>you do most of the talking and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship,</v>

1158
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:52.140
<v Speaker 4>he said told me that you take those </v>
<v Speaker 4>medications.</v>

1159
01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:54.780
<v Speaker 4>Would you still feel nervous and </v>
<v Speaker 4>depressed sometimes?</v>

1160
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:55.850
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not as.</v>

1161
01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:58.780
<v Speaker 4>Not as much as I would have been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't taking.</v>

1162
01:12:01.410 --> 01:12:03.380
<v Speaker 4>What do you think would have just </v>
<v Speaker 4>stopped taking this stuff?</v>

1163
01:12:04.710 --> 01:12:08.570
<v Speaker 4>And I tried it a couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't like what was starting to see</v>

1164
01:12:10.630 --> 01:12:15.180
<v Speaker 4>if I were becoming gradually on hinge </v>
<v Speaker 4>back on them again.</v>

1165
01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:18.423
<v Speaker 4>I tried a couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you still think they're picking my </v>

1166
01:12:22.901 --> 01:12:23.734
<v Speaker 4>brain?</v>

1167
01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:29.943
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't have to clean up for the </v>

01:12:30.711 --> 01:12:32.150
<v Speaker 3>cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>
