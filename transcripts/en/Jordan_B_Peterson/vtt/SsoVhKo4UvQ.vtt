1
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:02.553
<v Speaker 1>This lecture and the next are probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most explicitly philosophical </v>

2
00:00:05.441 --> 00:00:06.274
<v Speaker 1>lectures of the course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we moved into psychometrics and </v>

3
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.863
<v Speaker 1>biological psychology really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those are going to be the most </v>

4
00:00:14.231 --> 00:00:19.231
<v Speaker 1>scientific lectures of the course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking this morning about when I</v>

5
00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:24.441
<v Speaker 1>was preparing this lecture about</v>
<v Speaker 1>why I approach these topics this way.</v>

6
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.320
<v Speaker 1>I guess part of the answer is probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it isn't.</v>

7
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.080
<v Speaker 1>It isn't clear that the study of </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>

8
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.083
<v Speaker 1>at least in so far it has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The concern is to further the </v>

9
00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:45.024
<v Speaker 1>development of personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a concern that's associated </v>

10
00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:50.670
<v Speaker 1>with the desire for mental health or </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective wellbeing,</v>

11
00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:54.300
<v Speaker 1>which is a term I really don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>'Em or meaning.</v>

12
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.750
<v Speaker 1>It's not clear that those can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>strictly scientific pursuits.</v>

13
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.310
<v Speaker 1>So then if they're not strictly </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific pursuits,</v>

14
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.430
<v Speaker 1>what what should you do about </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding them?</v>

15
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.883
<v Speaker 1>If you look at studies after studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with that is you get a very </v>

16
00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:20.971
<v Speaker 1>narrow slice of the domain and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>often not very comprehensible because in</v>

17
00:01:21.401 --> 00:01:23.170
<v Speaker 1>order to understand the results of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>study,</v>

18
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.093
<v Speaker 1>you have to have the knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the underlying knowledge that's </v>

19
00:01:25.871 --> 00:01:28.690
<v Speaker 1>necessary to put the study in some sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of framework.</v>

20
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.483
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that framework is going to be developed </v>

21
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.550
<v Speaker 1>by studying the relevance scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature in psychological literature,</v>

22
00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:38.384
<v Speaker 1>but behind that the framework has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>expanded to include the relevant </v>

23
00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:42.674
<v Speaker 1>philosophical assumptions</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't really think that you can </v>

24
00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:49.750
<v Speaker 1>understand the details without </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding the assumptions.</v>

25
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.263
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think you're relegated to </v>

26
00:01:53.261 --> 00:01:54.094
<v Speaker 1>memorization if you don't understand the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentals and memorization has very </v>

27
00:01:58.601 --> 00:01:59.434
<v Speaker 1>little to do with knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you might be able to memorize </v>

28
00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:03.174
<v Speaker 1>procedures that would enable you to act </v>
<v Speaker 1>on something like perhaps to fix an </v>

29
00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:07.314
<v Speaker 1>automobile here or to repair or to play </v>
<v Speaker 1>a piece on the piano and it's not like </v>

30
00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:12.460
<v Speaker 1>those things are not worth doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

31
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.180
<v Speaker 1>for these ideas to take root and have </v>
<v Speaker 1>effected meaning,</v>

32
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.430
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand them at the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>level of analysis.</v>

33
00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:24.860
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I really like </v>
<v Speaker 1>about personality theory,</v>

34
00:02:24.861 --> 00:02:25.694
<v Speaker 1>especially the clinical end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although not exclusively the clinical </v>

35
00:02:28.011 --> 00:02:28.844
<v Speaker 1>end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the people who were conducting </v>

36
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.533
<v Speaker 1>clinical practice and writing clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory during the 20th century were in </v>

37
00:02:36.351 --> 00:02:41.330
<v Speaker 1>fact dealing with the most profound </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems that affect people.</v>

38
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.193
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started my academic career as a </v>

39
00:02:43.161 --> 00:02:45.860
<v Speaker 1>political scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well in so far as your,</v>

40
00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:48.170
<v Speaker 1>any sort of political scientist when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an undergraduate.</v>

41
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.930
<v Speaker 1>I was not interested in it at all by my </v>
<v Speaker 1>third year because what I found was that</v>

42
00:02:53.931 --> 00:02:56.150
<v Speaker 1>at least at this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know how much it's changed,</v>

43
00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>the political science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists had already</v>

44
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 2>decided that people were basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivated by economic concerns.</v>

45
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.193
<v Speaker 2>And to me that just was no use at all </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I wanted to know why they were </v>

46
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:12.160
<v Speaker 2>motivated by economic concerns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

47
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:14.663
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to understand people in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense if you already decide what they </v>

48
00:03:17.071 --> 00:03:17.904
<v Speaker 1>value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you can't figure out what they </v>

49
00:03:19.651 --> 00:03:22.350
<v Speaker 1>value or what they should value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a whole different issue.</v>

50
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.540
<v Speaker 1>And that psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an.</v>

51
00:03:26.541 --> 00:03:27.374
<v Speaker 1>And it's a deep question because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't even obvious whether the question </v>

52
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.503
<v Speaker 1>are there things you should value is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable question or that it can be </v>

53
00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:38.630
<v Speaker 1>reasonably answered thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you about that.</v>

54
00:03:38.631 --> 00:03:41.090
<v Speaker 1>That's most closely allied with my own </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

55
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.223
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean personal experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but say experience as a clinician is </v>

56
00:03:45.621 --> 00:03:49.340
<v Speaker 1>that aimless people are in real trouble</v>

57
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.490
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily know why that is and</v>

58
00:03:53.491 --> 00:03:58.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily know what that means</v>
<v Speaker 1>for what your aim should be,</v>

59
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.070
<v Speaker 1>but I've certainly seen for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you had to make a choice,</v>

60
00:04:02.071 --> 00:04:02.904
<v Speaker 1>which all of you will in the next five </v>
<v Speaker 1>years or so between pursuing something </v>

61
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.793
<v Speaker 1>like diligently and establishing a fixed</v>
<v Speaker 1>identity because of that or remaining </v>

62
00:04:14.281 --> 00:04:17.290
<v Speaker 1>bereft of choice and drifting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

63
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:19.680
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you that if you drift by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time you're 30,</v>

64
00:04:19.681 --> 00:04:22.530
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be one miserable person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

65
00:04:22.531 --> 00:04:23.364
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure why that is exactly and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>not exactly sure that that necessarily </v>

66
00:04:26.851 --> 00:04:29.640
<v Speaker 1>means that picking something and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sticking to it,</v>

67
00:04:29.641 --> 00:04:32.190
<v Speaker 1>which is a form of apprenticeship is </v>
<v Speaker 1>better than drifting.</v>

68
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.013
<v Speaker 1>It depends on what you mean by better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can tell you that not catalyzing </v>

69
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.433
<v Speaker 1>an identity seems to be a mistake and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fatal mistake by the time you're </v>

70
00:04:42.691 --> 00:04:44.400
<v Speaker 1>40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

71
00:04:44.401 --> 00:04:45.234
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to recover from it at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that point because you're not young </v>

72
00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:52.170
<v Speaker 1>anymore at that point and if you try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>catalyze an identity at that time,</v>

73
00:04:52.171 --> 00:04:53.004
<v Speaker 1>which sometimes can happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're competing with all these like </v>

74
00:04:54.841 --> 00:04:55.674
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shiny people and it's not who are much </v>

75
00:04:57.931 --> 00:05:01.650
<v Speaker 1>more full of potential from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective of an employer for example,</v>

76
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.660
<v Speaker 1>than you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets pretty dismal.</v>

77
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.313
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today we're going to go deeper into </v>

78
00:05:11.341 --> 00:05:14.100
<v Speaker 1>philosophical presuppositions that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have in the past and</v>

79
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.833
<v Speaker 1>I want to familiarize you with what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think are the great philosophical and </v>

80
00:05:20.811 --> 00:05:23.480
<v Speaker 1>psychological movements of the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century because they.</v>

81
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.920
<v Speaker 1>They shape you and they shaped the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>you live in in,</v>

82
00:05:26.921 --> 00:05:28.010
<v Speaker 1>in ways that are.</v>

83
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.530
<v Speaker 1>They're incalculable and if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand them,</v>

84
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:33.663
<v Speaker 1>you don't really know where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know where you are in history </v>

85
00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:39.040
<v Speaker 1>and you don't know what ideas you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>possessed by.</v>

86
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.680
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I told you when we were studying</v>

87
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.843
<v Speaker 1>that young said that people don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas that ideas have people which I </v>

88
00:05:47.561 --> 00:05:48.394
<v Speaker 1>believe to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of young's lasting contributions in </v>

89
00:05:52.781 --> 00:05:53.614
<v Speaker 1>some sense was that you should know what</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas possess you because otherwise you </v>

90
00:05:57.411 --> 00:05:58.244
<v Speaker 1>won't know what the hell they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you and when you think about all </v>

91
00:06:02.811 --> 00:06:03.644
<v Speaker 1>the irrational and apparently </v>
<v Speaker 1>counterproductive things that people do </v>

92
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:09.080
<v Speaker 1>as individuals and also in a mass.</v>

93
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.380
<v Speaker 1>You have to ask yourself if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be caught up in that sort of thing.</v>

94
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.273
<v Speaker 1>If you could be free from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you are caught up in it just exactly </v>

95
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.433
<v Speaker 1>where is it that you're headed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was also something that you </v>

96
00:06:22.961 --> 00:06:23.794
<v Speaker 1>thought you should figure out in case </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you were headed was not </v>

97
00:06:26.651 --> 00:06:27.484
<v Speaker 1>necessarily where you would go if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were making a fully informed conscious </v>

98
00:06:30.221 --> 00:06:31.054
<v Speaker 1>where you would like to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're making a fully informed </v>

99
00:06:32.381 --> 00:06:33.214
<v Speaker 1>conscious choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think the material that we're </v>

100
00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:35.644
<v Speaker 1>dealing with in the next two lectures is</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the most relevant of all of the </v>

101
00:06:39.161 --> 00:06:39.994
<v Speaker 1>material we're going to cover with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to the possession of people by </v>

102
00:06:44.771 --> 00:06:48.670
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The existentialists</v>

103
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:51.743
<v Speaker 1>who are tightly aligned philosophically </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the phenomenologists basically </v>

104
00:06:54.661 --> 00:06:55.494
<v Speaker 1>emerged as a psychological movement </v>
<v Speaker 1>after World War II and there were </v>

105
00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:02.004
<v Speaker 1>reasons for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean one of the reasons was that it </v>

106
00:07:04.111 --> 00:07:04.944
<v Speaker 1>was quite obvious not only that World </v>
<v Speaker 1>War Two was an ideological battle </v>

107
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.750
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally between fascism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>western democracy,</v>

108
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.333
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was immediately supplanted by </v>

109
00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.510
<v Speaker 1>another ideological battle which was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>one between communism and liberalism,</v>

110
00:07:21.511 --> 00:07:22.344
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the issue of ideological </v>

111
00:07:24.451 --> 00:07:29.340
<v Speaker 1>possession</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the and the relationship between the</v>

112
00:07:29.341 --> 00:07:34.341
<v Speaker 1>individual whose ideologically possessed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and their responsibility and the actions</v>

113
00:07:34.471 --> 00:07:39.000
<v Speaker 1>of the state became paramount concerns </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 19 fifties as they should have.</v>

114
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:40.263
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the last questions that </v>

115
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:42.923
<v Speaker 1>that remained after World War Two that </v>
<v Speaker 1>still has been insufficiently answered </v>

116
00:07:46.561 --> 00:07:49.770
<v Speaker 1>is when the mask goes insane.</v>

117
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.090
<v Speaker 1>What is the culpability of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals who compose the mass?</v>

118
00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:57.493
<v Speaker 1>Now you can circumvent that question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say with regards to what happened in </v>

119
00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:01.124
<v Speaker 1>Nazi Germany by assuming that it was top</v>
<v Speaker 1>down coercion that turned the massive </v>

120
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.790
<v Speaker 1>ordinary German citizens into majority </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazis,</v>

121
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.313
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that there's any </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence that those sorts of ideas are </v>

122
00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:15.494
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is research bearing on people's </v>

123
00:08:17.691 --> 00:08:22.691
<v Speaker 1>willingness to conform to authority </v>
<v Speaker 1>figures and that is somewhat wral.</v>

124
00:08:23.341 --> 00:08:27.470
<v Speaker 1>You know the famous experiments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prison experiment,</v>

125
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.450
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at Stanford,</v>

126
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.313
<v Speaker 1>where undergraduates were divided </v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrarily and two guards and </v>

127
00:08:32.781 --> 00:08:33.614
<v Speaker 1>prisoners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they ran a simulation of a </v>

128
00:08:35.361 --> 00:08:36.194
<v Speaker 1>prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then of course the guards turned into </v>

129
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:41.610
<v Speaker 1>sadistic psychopaths and the some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them did anyways,</v>

130
00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:45.590
<v Speaker 1>and the prisoners turned into like </v>
<v Speaker 1>cringing victims in no time flat.</v>

131
00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:46.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

132
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:47.063
<v Speaker 1>There's obviously an element there that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that demonstrates that people are very </v>

133
00:08:50.631 --> 00:08:55.040
<v Speaker 1>responsive to situational cues and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can go out of hand very rapidly,</v>

134
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.040
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't necessarily mean that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can use</v>

135
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:03.850
<v Speaker 1>your tendency to be</v>

136
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:05.753
<v Speaker 1>accommodating to authority or the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>tendency to be accommodating to </v>

137
00:09:08.551 --> 00:09:09.384
<v Speaker 1>authority as an explanation for the rise</v>
<v Speaker 1>of mass movements say like Nazi as Imr </v>

138
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.600
<v Speaker 1>or communism because it doesn't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>help.</v>

139
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.400
<v Speaker 1>The explanation doesn't really help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

140
00:09:17.401 --> 00:09:18.210
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

141
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:19.043
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people in the mass were mere </v>

142
00:09:21.241 --> 00:09:23.040
<v Speaker 1>followers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about the leaders?</v>

143
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:24.503
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're all followers right up to </v>

144
00:09:25.951 --> 00:09:28.320
<v Speaker 1>say Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's Hitler's fault.</v>

145
00:09:28.321 --> 00:09:29.790
<v Speaker 1>It's all Hitler's fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

146
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:30.653
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're elevating the guy to the status </v>

147
00:09:31.861 --> 00:09:34.530
<v Speaker 1>of a god at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know now and evil,</v>

148
00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:35.940
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still,</v>

149
00:09:35.941 --> 00:09:38.460
<v Speaker 1>if he's got all the motive power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's basically,</v>

150
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.473
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't separate him from the idea of </v>

151
00:09:41.401 --> 00:09:42.440
<v Speaker 1>Lucifer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

152
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:45.270
<v Speaker 1>he's become an archetypal figure of evil</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that point,</v>

153
00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.620
<v Speaker 1>and it's the same with Stalin and Mao.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

154
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:48.473
<v Speaker 1>no though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

155
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.310
<v Speaker 1>they were very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very bad men.</v>

156
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:55.290
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to localize all the evil in them and</v>

157
00:09:55.291 --> 00:09:58.520
<v Speaker 1>to consider everyone else victimized </v>
<v Speaker 1>followers is,</v>

158
00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:03.240
<v Speaker 1>it's a convenient idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not helpful.</v>

159
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:05.453
<v Speaker 1>Now that makes all the fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That just makes the followers pathetic </v>

160
00:10:09.011 --> 00:10:10.450
<v Speaker 1>for a different reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

161
00:10:10.451 --> 00:10:11.284
<v Speaker 1>they're not actively self engaged in </v>
<v Speaker 1>cruelty for their own purposes apart </v>

162
00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.130
<v Speaker 1>from conformity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're just as pathetic and evil as</v>

163
00:10:18.131 --> 00:10:21.610
<v Speaker 1>they would be if they were doing it on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own volition.</v>

164
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:24.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't see the difference between a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bully and bullies,</v>

165
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.810
<v Speaker 1>henchmen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

166
00:10:25.811 --> 00:10:28.230
<v Speaker 1>I think the bully probably has more </v>
<v Speaker 1>encouraged than the henchman,</v>

167
00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's courage of a fairly peculiar sort.</v>

168
00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.013
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

169
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.980
<v Speaker 1>so the existentialists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what they were concerned about,</v>

170
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:38.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

171
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:43.480
<v Speaker 1>the locus of their concern was basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was basically Nicha</v>

172
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.113
<v Speaker 1>and you all know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason I concentrate on nature and </v>

173
00:10:56.001 --> 00:10:56.834
<v Speaker 1>also on Dostoevsky is because I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>those two people summed up the 19th </v>

174
00:10:59.721 --> 00:11:00.554
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think that and that the </v>

175
00:11:03.591 --> 00:11:05.180
<v Speaker 1>problems that they laid out</v>

176
00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.513
<v Speaker 1>and predicted would unfold in the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century were the problems that unfolded </v>

177
00:11:13.601 --> 00:11:14.434
<v Speaker 1>in the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they got their predictions right and </v>

178
00:11:16.991 --> 00:11:17.824
<v Speaker 1>I think they got their causality right </v>
<v Speaker 1>to and given the inability of social </v>

179
00:11:22.661 --> 00:11:25.600
<v Speaker 1>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including psychologists to predict large</v>

180
00:11:25.601 --> 00:11:26.434
<v Speaker 1>term mass events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that these two people managed </v>

181
00:11:29.111 --> 00:11:32.570
<v Speaker 1>at 30 to 40 years before the events </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfolded,</v>

182
00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:33.423
<v Speaker 1>didn't even longer than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems to me that it's pretty much </v>

183
00:11:35.681 --> 00:11:37.960
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile to consider them </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists.</v>

184
00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:39.453
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly Nisha thought that of himself </v>

185
00:11:40.661 --> 00:11:44.020
<v Speaker 1>and so to Dostoevsky for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they had immense influence on people</v>

186
00:11:44.021 --> 00:11:47.950
<v Speaker 1>like Freud and jung and Rogers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the people that we'd been studying.</v>

187
00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:49.893
<v Speaker 1>Their thinking is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is lying underneath every issue we've </v>

188
00:11:52.511 --> 00:11:55.010
<v Speaker 1>discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

189
00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:59.680
<v Speaker 1>this is niches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of nature's great statements.</v>

190
00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.460
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

191
00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.293
<v Speaker 1>what is great?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One must either be silent or speak with </v>

192
00:12:04.351 --> 00:12:06.090
<v Speaker 1>greatness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with greatness.</v>

193
00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:10.650
<v Speaker 1>That means cynically in with innocence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I relate is the history of the next</v>

194
00:12:10.651 --> 00:12:14.890
<v Speaker 1>two centuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I described what is coming,</v>

195
00:12:14.891 --> 00:12:17.800
<v Speaker 1>what can no longer come differently?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The advent of nihilism,</v>

196
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.273
<v Speaker 1>our whole European culture is moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>from some time now with a tortured </v>

197
00:12:22.651 --> 00:12:23.484
<v Speaker 1>tension that is growing from decade to </v>
<v Speaker 1>decade as towards the catastrophe </v>

198
00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:27.293
<v Speaker 1>restlessly violently headlong like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>river that wants to reach the end that </v>

199
00:12:32.161 --> 00:12:35.220
<v Speaker 1>no longer reflects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's afraid to reflect.</v>

200
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.880
<v Speaker 1>He that speaks here has conversely done </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing so far,</v>

201
00:12:38.881 --> 00:12:39.714
<v Speaker 1>but to reflect as a philosopher and </v>
<v Speaker 1>solitary by instinct who has found his </v>

202
00:12:43.771 --> 00:12:47.250
<v Speaker 1>advantage in standing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aside outside,</v>

203
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.090
<v Speaker 1>why has the advent of nihilism become </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary?</v>

204
00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:58.110
<v Speaker 1>Because the values we have had hitherto </v>
<v Speaker 1>thus draw their final consequence.</v>

205
00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:59.183
<v Speaker 1>Because Nihilism represents the ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>logical extension of our great values </v>

206
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.433
<v Speaker 1>and ideals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we must experience nihilism </v>

207
00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.090
<v Speaker 1>because before we can find out what </v>
<v Speaker 1>value these values really had.</v>

208
00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.510
<v Speaker 1>So one of nature's claims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

209
00:13:12.511 --> 00:13:13.344
<v Speaker 1>was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Christianity in Europe transformed </v>

210
00:13:17.971 --> 00:13:18.804
<v Speaker 1>itself into science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he felt that that one of the advantage </v>

211
00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:28.840
<v Speaker 1>to the Catholic domination of Europe for</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many centuries was that</v>

212
00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:31.693
<v Speaker 1>the mind of the Catholic adherence who </v>
<v Speaker 1>took the discipline seriously or the </v>

213
00:13:34.941 --> 00:13:35.774
<v Speaker 1>dogmas seriously learn to interpret all </v>
<v Speaker 1>events under the under the Schema of a </v>

214
00:13:42.021 --> 00:13:42.854
<v Speaker 1>single theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he thought about that as a form of </v>

215
00:13:44.931 --> 00:13:46.250
<v Speaker 1>discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could imagine.</v>

216
00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:49.910
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I want to teach you how to theorize,</v>

217
00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:53.810
<v Speaker 1>I might teach you a theory and have you </v>
<v Speaker 1>adopted</v>

218
00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:57.530
<v Speaker 1>and niches point would mean be that </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

219
00:13:57.531 --> 00:14:00.170
<v Speaker 1>that means you know a theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also means something else.</v>

220
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:01.143
<v Speaker 1>It also means that now you know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>theorize and the important consequence </v>

221
00:14:06.231 --> 00:14:08.300
<v Speaker 1>of learning a theory may not be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>

222
00:14:08.301 --> 00:14:10.100
<v Speaker 1>It may be that you've learned to fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>rocks.</v>

223
00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:12.043
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature also pointed out that once you </v>

224
00:14:13.011 --> 00:14:15.530
<v Speaker 1>learn to theorize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can separate yourself from the.</v>

225
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:17.990
<v Speaker 1>From the theory that gave rise to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>

226
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:21.350
<v Speaker 1>And so you can start to theorize even </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the theory that you mastered,</v>

227
00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:22.813
<v Speaker 1>and he thought that's what happened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe as a consequence of its </v>

228
00:14:25.431 --> 00:14:26.264
<v Speaker 1>domination by Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially because of Christianity is </v>

229
00:14:28.501 --> 00:14:32.030
<v Speaker 1>essential insistence on the utility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth.</v>

230
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:32.923
<v Speaker 1>Now he thought that was transformed </v>
<v Speaker 1>after Catholicism into scientific </v>

231
00:14:37.071 --> 00:14:37.904
<v Speaker 1>investigation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that the spirit of theorizing and </v>

232
00:14:39.981 --> 00:14:40.814
<v Speaker 1>truth remained intact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that the consequence of that </v>

233
00:14:43.101 --> 00:14:46.820
<v Speaker 1>was that the European mind was </v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplined by a dogma.</v>

234
00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:47.773
<v Speaker 1>Then it freed itself from the dogma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it turned its power on the Dogma </v>

235
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:55.550
<v Speaker 1>and noted that the dogmas itself seemed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be grounded in nothing.</v>

236
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:56.443
<v Speaker 1>That you could get a grip on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you grip things with an </v>

237
00:14:59.181 --> 00:15:01.490
<v Speaker 1>empirical mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it fell apart.</v>

238
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.673
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not saying much more than </v>

239
00:15:04.401 --> 00:15:07.280
<v Speaker 1>science posed a fatal challenge to </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>

240
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:12.050
<v Speaker 1>but it's saying it in a much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>profound and interesting way.</v>

241
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.690
<v Speaker 1>And it also explains why he makes this </v>
<v Speaker 1>claim,</v>

242
00:15:14.691 --> 00:15:18.830
<v Speaker 1>that nihilism is the logical conclusion </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the great values and ideals.</v>

243
00:15:18.831 --> 00:15:22.310
<v Speaker 1>So he didn't think about nihilism as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>counter proposition.</v>

244
00:15:22.311 --> 00:15:23.144
<v Speaker 1>Say too dogmatic Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought about it as the logical </v>

245
00:15:26.481 --> 00:15:30.440
<v Speaker 1>outcome of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now you think,</v>

246
00:15:30.441 --> 00:15:31.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that relevant?</v>

247
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.590
<v Speaker 1>Why is that relevant?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

248
00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.230
<v Speaker 1>I think it's relevant for a lot of ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>are for a lot of reasons.</v>

249
00:15:36.231 --> 00:15:37.064
<v Speaker 1>The first question is are the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>observation might be that a tremendous </v>

250
00:15:41.781 --> 00:15:44.450
<v Speaker 1>amount of mental illness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is an existential claim,</v>

251
00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.040
<v Speaker 1>is grounded in nihilism.</v>

252
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.370
<v Speaker 1>When someone who's depressed comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see you,</v>

253
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.533
<v Speaker 1>what they often say is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see any point in life and that </v>

254
00:15:54.651 --> 00:15:55.484
<v Speaker 1>isn't what they mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they mean is they see the meaning </v>

255
00:15:59.031 --> 00:16:01.580
<v Speaker 1>of life as suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a meaning,</v>

256
00:16:01.581 --> 00:16:04.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's and that that's not bearable,</v>

257
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:07.490
<v Speaker 1>and then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given that,</v>

258
00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:08.413
<v Speaker 1>why bother with it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the fundamental question of </v>

259
00:16:11.211 --> 00:16:13.640
<v Speaker 1>suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a philosophical question.</v>

260
00:16:13.641 --> 00:16:17.600
<v Speaker 1>I think it was [inaudible] who said that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only real philosophical question was</v>

261
00:16:17.601 --> 00:16:20.050
<v Speaker 1>whether or not to commit suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>

262
00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.170
<v Speaker 1>that's a little dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

263
00:16:21.171 --> 00:16:22.740
<v Speaker 1>he might get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it will come in,</v>

264
00:16:22.741 --> 00:16:27.320
<v Speaker 1>we could have used some Ssri,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you get the point and it's,</v>

265
00:16:27.321 --> 00:16:28.010
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

266
00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:30.620
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's inappropriate in my estimation,</v>

267
00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:31.993
<v Speaker 1>to even discuss something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even to discuss depression with someone </v>

268
00:16:36.441 --> 00:16:37.274
<v Speaker 1>who's depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're intelligent and </v>

269
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:40.183
<v Speaker 1>open and therefore more tilted towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical wonderings without </v>

270
00:16:45.021 --> 00:16:46.460
<v Speaker 1>actually addressing the issue.</v>

271
00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Why live in the face of suffering?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

272
00:16:49.851 --> 00:16:53.390
<v Speaker 1>so that's one problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's to the degree that you will find it</v>

273
00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:57.980
<v Speaker 1>difficult in your life to build anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>solid under your feet that you can stand</v>

274
00:16:57.981 --> 00:17:01.310
<v Speaker 1>on and and believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have faith in.</v>

275
00:17:01.311 --> 00:17:02.144
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you're going to be adrift and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason for that is a lot of the </v>

276
00:17:05.961 --> 00:17:06.794
<v Speaker 1>things you're going to have to do will </v>
<v Speaker 1>be difficult and they'll involve </v>

277
00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:11.960
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also an existential claim.</v>

278
00:17:11.961 --> 00:17:12.794
<v Speaker 1>So the existentialists for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't make the same claim Freud </v>

279
00:17:15.441 --> 00:17:16.670
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud claims that</v>

280
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:19.603
<v Speaker 1>in some sense that the normal person is </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally healthy apart from the mild </v>

281
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:24.583
<v Speaker 1>distress of normal life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then in order to be </v>

282
00:17:26.331 --> 00:17:29.450
<v Speaker 1>psychopathological you have to have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt</v>

283
00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:31.813
<v Speaker 1>and maybe multiple times or there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>other things that could contribute to </v>

284
00:17:34.491 --> 00:17:36.080
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the existentialists would say,</v>

285
00:17:36.081 --> 00:17:36.351
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

286
00:17:36.351 --> 00:17:36.841
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's.</v>

287
00:17:36.841 --> 00:17:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Let's just wait a minute here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the fundamental condition of human</v>

288
00:17:41.391 --> 00:17:42.224
<v Speaker 1>beings is nihilism and suffering and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that something has to be produced to </v>

289
00:17:47.901 --> 00:17:50.880
<v Speaker 1>counter that in order for life to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerable.</v>

290
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.053
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think that's a perfectly </v>

291
00:17:55.021 --> 00:17:55.854
<v Speaker 1>reasonable proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a strange proposition because </v>

292
00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:58.973
<v Speaker 1>I've seen in my lifetime I've seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are tormented by existential </v>

293
00:18:02.821 --> 00:18:04.740
<v Speaker 1>ideas who can't get them out of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

294
00:18:04.741 --> 00:18:07.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas that relate to the meaning of life</v>

295
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:09.840
<v Speaker 1>and then other people and and concerned </v>
<v Speaker 1>about death,</v>

296
00:18:09.841 --> 00:18:10.674
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the extinguishing of everything that </v>

297
00:18:11.971 --> 00:18:12.804
<v Speaker 1>seems to have any value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's our primary concern with them and </v>

298
00:18:15.541 --> 00:18:19.020
<v Speaker 1>then I've seen other people for whom </v>
<v Speaker 1>those questions never seem to arise.</v>

299
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:21.690
<v Speaker 1>Now I think those people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

300
00:18:21.691 --> 00:18:22.524
<v Speaker 1>I think they're conservative people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're very open and I </v>

301
00:18:24.811 --> 00:18:27.180
<v Speaker 1>think they're probably rather low in </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism,</v>

302
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:28.463
<v Speaker 1>so they're not philosophically curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't go up chains of abstractions </v>

303
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:32.933
<v Speaker 1>and even if they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't necessarily get disturbed in </v>

304
00:18:35.041 --> 00:18:38.730
<v Speaker 1>the most profound areas of there being </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the questioning,</v>

305
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:41.970
<v Speaker 1>but that still leaves plenty of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the other category.</v>

306
00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.190
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nihilism.</v>

307
00:18:48.191 --> 00:18:49.024
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know there's naturalism and atheism </v>

308
00:18:51.761 --> 00:18:52.594
<v Speaker 1>or closely related.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're identical by any </v>

309
00:18:54.251 --> 00:18:55.084
<v Speaker 1>stretch of the imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I think it's difficult for </v>

310
00:18:57.401 --> 00:18:58.234
<v Speaker 1>atheism to describe why it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially nihilistic and that's </v>

311
00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky's big criticism because </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dostoyevsky's claim was that without any</v>

312
00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:07.953
<v Speaker 1>fundamental value assumed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's no reason why you can't do </v>

313
00:19:13.031 --> 00:19:16.450
<v Speaker 1>anything you want and that's his famous </v>
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

314
00:19:16.451 --> 00:19:17.284
<v Speaker 1>If there is no god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then everything is permitted and all of </v>

315
00:19:18.971 --> 00:19:19.804
<v Speaker 1>Dostoyevsky's novel writing is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration of that idea and sometimes </v>

316
00:19:25.931 --> 00:19:26.764
<v Speaker 1>it's an exploration of what that idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>might mean if it was acted out in the </v>

317
00:19:29.261 --> 00:19:30.094
<v Speaker 1>life of a given individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be say crime and </v>

318
00:19:31.811 --> 00:19:35.020
<v Speaker 1>punishment and another would be say in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his book,</v>

319
00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.810
<v Speaker 1>the devil's are the possessed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unreal.</v>

320
00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:37.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

321
00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:38.733
<v Speaker 1>it's an examination of what that idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>means if it's gripped by an individual </v>

322
00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:43.623
<v Speaker 1>who has social and political ambitions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's when Dostoevsky basically </v>

323
00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.390
<v Speaker 1>prophesied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

324
00:19:49.391 --> 00:19:53.650
<v Speaker 1>that one of the consequences of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>death of God would be the rise basically</v>

325
00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:54.484
<v Speaker 1>of communist totalitarianism because </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially that's what he predicted in </v>

326
00:19:57.221 --> 00:19:58.054
<v Speaker 1>the devils,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's pretty dead on accurate </v>

327
00:20:01.181 --> 00:20:01.630
<v Speaker 1>prediction.</v>

328
00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:03.920
<v Speaker 1>It was really quite stunning to me when </v>
<v Speaker 1>I came across it.</v>

329
00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Injury made exactly the same prediction </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

330
00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.373
<v Speaker 1>and so for those two men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the death of an ultimate meaning </v>

331
00:20:11.231 --> 00:20:13.780
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially one that you can see when you</v>

332
00:20:13.781 --> 00:20:15.790
<v Speaker 1>think about something like European </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity.</v>

333
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:16.673
<v Speaker 1>It's misleading in some sense because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the system of beliefs that that </v>

334
00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:20.793
<v Speaker 1>constituted European Christianity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>other great belief systems wasn't 2000 </v>

335
00:20:26.051 --> 00:20:30.310
<v Speaker 1>years old was like 25,000 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

336
00:20:30.311 --> 00:20:31.144
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think about a desk beginning at </v>

337
00:20:33.251 --> 00:20:34.780
<v Speaker 1>year zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a mistake.</v>

338
00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:37.180
<v Speaker 1>It's a mistake from a historical </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

339
00:20:37.181 --> 00:20:38.014
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that profound religious traditions are </v>

340
00:20:42.251 --> 00:20:45.580
<v Speaker 1>predicated on are generally grounded in </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas that are much,</v>

341
00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:47.860
<v Speaker 1>much older than the traditions </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

342
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:52.450
<v Speaker 1>And so in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when at the end of the 19th century when</v>

343
00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:55.960
<v Speaker 1>things fell apart for us and we can no </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer rely on our,</v>

344
00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:59.440
<v Speaker 1>our history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>predicated morality to guide us,</v>

345
00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:02.830
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't merely that we lost an </v>
<v Speaker 1>overlay,</v>

346
00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:06.760
<v Speaker 1>a psychological overlay that had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>laid on humanity for 2000 years.</v>

347
00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.480
<v Speaker 1>It was way deeper than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't even know how long those,</v>

348
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:11.583
<v Speaker 1>how old those ideas are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We knew we have some idea about how old </v>

349
00:21:14.231 --> 00:21:15.064
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're at least as old as written </v>

350
00:21:16.211 --> 00:21:17.044
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we also know that the people that </v>

351
00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:21.910
<v Speaker 1>who have been brought into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstreams of history,</v>

352
00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:24.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the world has united,</v>

353
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.233
<v Speaker 1>the people who are not literate had </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythologies that drew from the same </v>

354
00:21:28.811 --> 00:21:31.870
<v Speaker 1>themes in some of those people as far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can tell,</v>

355
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:37.000
<v Speaker 1>had lived a lifestyle that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially unchanged for 25,000 years.</v>

356
00:21:37.001 --> 00:21:39.340
<v Speaker 1>And so the Australian aborigines are </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

357
00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:40.773
<v Speaker 1>So there's plenty of evidence that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea is these ideas are extraordinarily </v>

358
00:21:44.591 --> 00:21:45.424
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that when we </v>

359
00:21:46.211 --> 00:21:47.710
<v Speaker 1>separate from them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>

360
00:21:47.711 --> 00:21:50.770
<v Speaker 1>not only do we separate from our </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical presuppositions,</v>

361
00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:56.220
<v Speaker 1>but we separate from the historical </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of our biology.</v>

362
00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:57.903
<v Speaker 1>It's a serious problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's partly why it's very </v>

363
00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:02.403
<v Speaker 1>difficult to distinguish between someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's nihilistic and someone who's </v>

364
00:22:05.291 --> 00:22:10.060
<v Speaker 1>mentally ill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a radical claim.</v>

365
00:22:10.061 --> 00:22:10.894
<v Speaker 1>I mean people especially who are on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed side of the distribution will </v>

366
00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:16.060
<v Speaker 1>will tell you that they're nihilistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

367
00:22:16.061 --> 00:22:18.820
<v Speaker 1>they may not use that terminology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they often do.</v>

368
00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:20.980
<v Speaker 1>I just can't see any point.</v>

369
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.740
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why does that matter?</v>

370
00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does it matter?</v>

371
00:22:25.211 --> 00:22:29.110
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be a fact that it matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's an interesting fact.</v>

372
00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:31.630
<v Speaker 1>That's a phenomenal logical fact in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

373
00:22:31.631 --> 00:22:32.464
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that heidegger</v>
<v Speaker 1>pointed out and he was a founder of the </v>

374
00:22:35.231 --> 00:22:38.420
<v Speaker 1>phenomenological school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that the,</v>

375
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:39.700
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

376
00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:40.533
<v Speaker 1>your primary orientation to the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thinks in a strange way that your </v>

377
00:22:43.481 --> 00:22:46.660
<v Speaker 1>primary orientation to the world was one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of care.</v>

378
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:48.490
<v Speaker 1>So you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

379
00:22:48.491 --> 00:22:53.491
<v Speaker 1>what characterizes your experience?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What sort of creature ru and heidegger's</v>

380
00:22:53.711 --> 00:22:54.730
<v Speaker 1>answer would be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

381
00:22:54.731 --> 00:22:55.564
<v Speaker 1>you're a creature who cares about things</v>
<v Speaker 1>in so far as you're engaged in the </v>

382
00:22:58.511 --> 00:22:59.344
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your primary orientation is one of care </v>

383
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:03.790
<v Speaker 1>and you can think about that as a value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

384
00:23:03.791 --> 00:23:04.271
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

385
00:23:04.271 --> 00:23:05.104
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a consequence of your value </v>

386
00:23:06.221 --> 00:23:08.860
<v Speaker 1>orientation and God only knows where </v>
<v Speaker 1>that comes from.</v>

387
00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Part of its biological part of is </v>
<v Speaker 1>developmental,</v>

388
00:23:11.771 --> 00:23:13.690
<v Speaker 1>part of it's historical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

389
00:23:13.691 --> 00:23:14.524
<v Speaker 1>very complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you stopped caring about </v>

390
00:23:16.361 --> 00:23:20.100
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in trouble and that that's one of</v>

391
00:23:20.101 --> 00:23:20.934
<v Speaker 1>the things that seems to indicate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>caring is actually a fundamental </v>

392
00:23:23.731 --> 00:23:25.890
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start caring about things.</v>

393
00:23:25.891 --> 00:23:26.724
<v Speaker 1>You don't stop suffering and it seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>that unless the caring counterbalances </v>

394
00:23:30.511 --> 00:23:31.344
<v Speaker 1>the suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't maintain an even keel and </v>

395
00:23:33.091 --> 00:23:35.270
<v Speaker 1>that's partly because it doesn't seem </v>
<v Speaker 1>just right.</v>

396
00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean when terrible things happen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

397
00:23:37.081 --> 00:23:37.914
<v Speaker 1>they always say,</v>

398
00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:40.103
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two things.</v>

399
00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:43.680
<v Speaker 1>How is it that being could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>constituted in this manner?</v>

400
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:44.543
<v Speaker 1>Like what the Hell's going at?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fundamental levels of reality that </v>

401
00:23:47.191 --> 00:23:48.024
<v Speaker 1>such suffering has to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll certainly ask that if you have a </v>

402
00:23:50.931 --> 00:23:53.360
<v Speaker 1>child who's diagnosed with cancer for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

403
00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:55.940
<v Speaker 1>or you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

404
00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:56.863
<v Speaker 1>why is this cruelty?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As it appears necessarily aimed at me </v>

405
00:24:00.231 --> 00:24:01.064
<v Speaker 1>right now in this place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when hypothetically it could have not </v>

406
00:24:03.381 --> 00:24:07.160
<v Speaker 1>happened at all or perhaps being visited</v>
<v Speaker 1>on someone more deserving,</v>

407
00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the good remain,</v>

408
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:12.290
<v Speaker 1>the gooder punished to the evil remain </v>
<v Speaker 1>unpunished,</v>

409
00:24:12.291 --> 00:24:13.124
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that that produces for human beings </v>

410
00:24:15.231 --> 00:24:20.231
<v Speaker 1>that produces a cry of</v>
<v Speaker 1>of of a cry for justice.</v>

411
00:24:22.401 --> 00:24:23.234
<v Speaker 1>How?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can the world be constituted that </v>

412
00:24:24.411 --> 00:24:25.244
<v Speaker 1>way and that seems to be built into us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those aren't questions we can just </v>

413
00:24:27.531 --> 00:24:28.364
<v Speaker 1>avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are questions that will arise in </v>

414
00:24:29.901 --> 00:24:33.080
<v Speaker 1>your psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll arise this fundamental questions</v>

415
00:24:33.081 --> 00:24:36.290
<v Speaker 1>when when sufficiently terrible things </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to you,</v>

416
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:38.900
<v Speaker 1>so the existentialists would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

417
00:24:38.901 --> 00:24:41.390
<v Speaker 1>those are conditions of existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just stuck with that.</v>

418
00:24:41.391 --> 00:24:42.224
<v Speaker 1>It's part of it's part of human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part of human being to to be </v>

419
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:49.700
<v Speaker 1>perplexed by those questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the question is,</v>

420
00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:52.130
<v Speaker 1>at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there any way of answering them?</v>

421
00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.900
<v Speaker 1>You said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we require it some time.</v>

422
00:24:57.901 --> 00:25:01.710
<v Speaker 1>New Values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nihilism stands at the door.</v>

423
00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Whence comes this uncanny as to all </v>
<v Speaker 1>guests</v>

424
00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:07.343
<v Speaker 1>point of departure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is an error to consider social </v>

425
00:25:10.831 --> 00:25:14.670
<v Speaker 1>distress or physiological degeneration </v>
<v Speaker 1>or corruption of all things as the cause</v>

426
00:25:14.671 --> 00:25:16.560
<v Speaker 1>of nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

427
00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:17.483
<v Speaker 1>that's a typical night Nietzschean </v>
<v Speaker 1>phrase because there are three profound </v>

428
00:25:21.121 --> 00:25:25.050
<v Speaker 1>ideas in that sentence and each one is </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a different phrase.</v>

429
00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:25.913
<v Speaker 1>So neat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said at one point I can write in a </v>

430
00:25:27.961 --> 00:25:29.820
<v Speaker 1>sentence what other people write in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

431
00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:31.890
<v Speaker 1>and then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

432
00:25:31.891 --> 00:25:33.870
<v Speaker 1>what other people can't even write in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

433
00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:36.240
<v Speaker 1>and this sentence is a good example of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

434
00:25:36.241 --> 00:25:37.290
<v Speaker 1>So what does he say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

435
00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you see that people are suffering and</v>

436
00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:41.753
<v Speaker 1>in trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing you can say that is that the </v>

437
00:25:43.861 --> 00:25:44.694
<v Speaker 1>reason for that is that the economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>system is unjust and they're layered </v>

438
00:25:47.191 --> 00:25:50.370
<v Speaker 1>along the bottom and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental cause of their suffering,</v>

439
00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:53.730
<v Speaker 1>but nature doesn't allow that to be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation,</v>

440
00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:54.713
<v Speaker 1>a causal interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he says there are multiple ways </v>

441
00:25:57.871 --> 00:26:01.830
<v Speaker 1>of interpreting your position and mere </v>
<v Speaker 1>absence of material.</v>

442
00:26:01.831 --> 00:26:05.520
<v Speaker 1>Luxury does not necessarily destined you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to one perspective or another</v>

443
00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:08.883
<v Speaker 1>physiological degeneration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While people are unhappy or suffering </v>

444
00:26:11.471 --> 00:26:12.304
<v Speaker 1>because they're ill in some manner where</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you could make that a matter of </v>

445
00:26:15.971 --> 00:26:20.380
<v Speaker 1>definition by saying that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering or unhappy you are ill,</v>

446
00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:21.333
<v Speaker 1>but that's not a causal argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a different way of </v>

447
00:26:23.381 --> 00:26:24.214
<v Speaker 1>categorizing the data and neat you would</v>
<v Speaker 1>reject that because he would also note </v>

448
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:29.463
<v Speaker 1>that there's some correlation between </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiological health and meaning in </v>

449
00:26:34.541 --> 00:26:35.374
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the correlation is the correlation </v>

450
00:26:37.181 --> 00:26:39.490
<v Speaker 1>doesn't imply causality and and even if </v>
<v Speaker 1>it did,</v>

451
00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:40.413
<v Speaker 1>the relationship is by no means perfect </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the that you would want a </v>

452
00:26:43.831 --> 00:26:44.664
<v Speaker 1>relationship to be before you accepted </v>
<v Speaker 1>it as relevant or corruption of all </v>

453
00:26:49.321 --> 00:26:50.154
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While that would be the idea that being </v>

454
00:26:51.781 --> 00:26:53.610
<v Speaker 1>itself is evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an evil trick,</v>

455
00:26:53.611 --> 00:26:55.320
<v Speaker 1>which is what tolstoy said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

456
00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:56.363
<v Speaker 1>when he wrote his confessions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because tall story at the height of his </v>

457
00:26:58.891 --> 00:26:59.724
<v Speaker 1>intellectual power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was the most famous novelist in the </v>

458
00:27:01.861 --> 00:27:04.740
<v Speaker 1>world and unbelievably well regarded </v>
<v Speaker 1>while throughout the world,</v>

459
00:27:04.741 --> 00:27:05.574
<v Speaker 1>but particularly in Russia and he was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very like socially benevolent man and </v>

460
00:27:09.691 --> 00:27:10.980
<v Speaker 1>well regarded for his wisdom.</v>

461
00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:11.813
<v Speaker 1>For years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was afraid to go outside with a rope </v>

462
00:27:14.011 --> 00:27:16.530
<v Speaker 1>or a gun because he thought he would </v>
<v Speaker 1>either hang or shoot himself.</v>

463
00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:17.753
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that was that he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been struck by the idea that life is so </v>

464
00:27:24.421 --> 00:27:25.254
<v Speaker 1>unbearable that it should be eradicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he couldn't think his way out of </v>

465
00:27:28.531 --> 00:27:30.150
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

466
00:27:30.151 --> 00:27:31.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

467
00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:31.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

468
00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:32.563
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

469
00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:36.720
<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a form of thought that was actually very</v>

470
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:40.710
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of intellectuals in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia during his time,</v>

471
00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.360
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during his time,</v>

472
00:27:42.361 --> 00:27:43.410
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his place.</v>

473
00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:44.693
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky wrote about exactly the same </v>

474
00:27:46.171 --> 00:27:47.070
<v Speaker 1>sorts of things,</v>

475
00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:54.060
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even tolstoy noted that merely observing</v>

476
00:27:54.061 --> 00:27:57.660
<v Speaker 1>that the world was a corrupt and evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>place was not necessarily enough to tell</v>

477
00:27:57.661 --> 00:27:58.494
<v Speaker 1>people towards nihilism because there </v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed to be people who weren't </v>

478
00:28:01.171 --> 00:28:04.020
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic despite the fact that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems self evident to him.</v>

479
00:28:04.021 --> 00:28:08.640
<v Speaker 1>And he thought tolstoy actually turned </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the Russian people.</v>

480
00:28:08.641 --> 00:28:09.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

481
00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.580
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was very entranced by the idea of the</v>

482
00:28:11.581 --> 00:28:16.080
<v Speaker 1>folk and folk wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he turned to the Russian people as a</v>

483
00:28:16.081 --> 00:28:16.914
<v Speaker 1>source of new inspiration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the peasantry and tolstoy actually </v>

484
00:28:19.951 --> 00:28:23.640
<v Speaker 1>fought for the freedom of the peasantry </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he felt that there are simple faith,</v>

485
00:28:23.641 --> 00:28:24.474
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was something truly admirable rather </v>

486
00:28:27.001 --> 00:28:31.380
<v Speaker 1>than something pathetically pathetic and</v>
<v Speaker 1>weak from an intellectual perspective.</v>

487
00:28:31.381 --> 00:28:36.300
<v Speaker 1>He strove to emulate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That criticism lists faith,</v>

488
00:28:36.301 --> 00:28:37.134
<v Speaker 1>but of course he couldn't do it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>once you've taken a bite out of the </v>

489
00:28:39.931 --> 00:28:41.250
<v Speaker 1>apple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no going back,</v>

490
00:28:41.251 --> 00:28:44.850
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Need just says distress,</v>

491
00:28:44.851 --> 00:28:47.490
<v Speaker 1>whether psychic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical or intellectual need not at all</v>

492
00:28:47.491 --> 00:28:50.610
<v Speaker 1>produced nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the radical rejection of value,</v>

493
00:28:50.611 --> 00:28:51.444
<v Speaker 1>meaning and desirability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Such distress always permits a variety </v>

494
00:28:54.121 --> 00:28:54.954
<v Speaker 1>of interpretations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather it is one particular </v>

495
00:28:57.511 --> 00:28:59.160
<v Speaker 1>interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Christian world,</v>

496
00:28:59.161 --> 00:28:59.994
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that nihilism is rooted the end of </v>

497
00:29:01.261 --> 00:29:05.280
<v Speaker 1>Christianity at the hands of its own </v>
<v Speaker 1>morality which cannot be replaced,</v>

498
00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:09.090
<v Speaker 1>which turns against the Christian God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sense of truthfulness,</v>

499
00:29:09.091 --> 00:29:09.924
<v Speaker 1>highly developed by Christianity is </v>
<v Speaker 1>nauseated by the falseness and </v>

500
00:29:12.841 --> 00:29:13.674
<v Speaker 1>mendacious snus of all Christian </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretations of the world and of </v>

501
00:29:16.711 --> 00:29:17.544
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

502
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:22.680
<v Speaker 1>It's a rebound from God is the truth to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the equally fanatical faith.</v>

503
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:27.800
<v Speaker 1>All his false and active Buddhism </v>
<v Speaker 1>skepticism regarding morality is what is</v>

504
00:29:28.741 --> 00:29:29.574
<v Speaker 1>decisive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The end of the moral interpretation of </v>

505
00:29:32.161 --> 00:29:32.994
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which no longer has any sanction after </v>

506
00:29:34.771 --> 00:29:38.100
<v Speaker 1>just tried to escape into some beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>leads to nihilism,</v>

507
00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:41.500
<v Speaker 1>all lacks meaning well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's rooted niches,</v>

508
00:29:41.501 --> 00:29:42.334
<v Speaker 1>criticism of Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he believed that Christianity </v>

509
00:29:44.411 --> 00:29:45.244
<v Speaker 1>was exceptionally morally flawed because</v>
<v Speaker 1>all it offered its followers was the </v>

510
00:29:48.581 --> 00:29:49.414
<v Speaker 1>possibility of salvation and redemption </v>
<v Speaker 1>from their suffering after they were </v>

511
00:29:54.221 --> 00:29:55.054
<v Speaker 1>dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was projected into some other </v>

512
00:29:56.531 --> 00:29:59.170
<v Speaker 1>world which as far as nature is </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>

513
00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:00.213
<v Speaker 1>alleviated people have their local </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility to try to improve things </v>

514
00:30:03.011 --> 00:30:03.844
<v Speaker 1>here and now and use comments about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were essentially that it was the pro </v>

515
00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.553
<v Speaker 1>scientists recognition of the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the spiritual salvation that </v>

516
00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Christianity promised was no longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficient.</v>

517
00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:18.370
<v Speaker 1>That motivated the development of </v>
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>

518
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:19.960
<v Speaker 1>So for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>

519
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.823
<v Speaker 1>for the early Christians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is part of the tension between </v>

520
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:26.020
<v Speaker 1>Christianity and science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the early Christians,</v>

521
00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:29.980
<v Speaker 1>the idea was that the earth in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense was inner radical bleak,</v>

522
00:30:29.981 --> 00:30:30.814
<v Speaker 1>corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that all you could hope for in your </v>

523
00:30:32.591 --> 00:30:35.170
<v Speaker 1>earthly life was suffering and that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should.</v>

524
00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.273
<v Speaker 1>You should accept your suffering and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hope for salvation in the future after </v>

525
00:30:39.761 --> 00:30:41.380
<v Speaker 1>you're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

526
00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:42.963
<v Speaker 1>obviously that philosophy seat appeared </v>
<v Speaker 1>insufficient for people and Young's </v>

527
00:30:48.161 --> 00:30:48.994
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis about the development of </v>
<v Speaker 1>science was that a counter fantasy </v>

528
00:30:52.211 --> 00:30:54.520
<v Speaker 1>developed in the unconscious of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europeans,</v>

529
00:30:54.521 --> 00:30:55.354
<v Speaker 1>which was that the material realm which </v>
<v Speaker 1>had been defined as evil and therefor </v>

530
00:31:00.911 --> 00:31:01.744
<v Speaker 1>not worthy of any study or any pursuit </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever actually held the seeds of </v>

531
00:31:05.351 --> 00:31:06.184
<v Speaker 1>the redemption that was lacking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that was young's commentary on </v>

532
00:31:09.731 --> 00:31:10.564
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the philosopher stone </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the alchemist who are who were </v>

533
00:31:13.161 --> 00:31:13.994
<v Speaker 1>pro scientists were trying to trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find a material substance that would be </v>

534
00:31:18.311 --> 00:31:23.311
<v Speaker 1>the philosopher's stone that would offer</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's holders wealth,</v>

535
00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:27.400
<v Speaker 1>health and eternal life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you think,</v>

536
00:31:27.401 --> 00:31:29.380
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are we pursuing science?</v>

537
00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:31.391
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully,</v>

538
00:31:31.391 --> 00:31:35.530
<v Speaker 1>because we think it'll do some good here</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now right in our bodies,</v>

539
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:40.830
<v Speaker 1>and so you regarded science itself as </v>
<v Speaker 1>stemming from that compensate story,</v>

540
00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:43.630
<v Speaker 1>dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant idea.</v>

541
00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:45.183
<v Speaker 1>It's actually the only idea I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>read that that seems to do a reasonable </v>

542
00:31:48.761 --> 00:31:49.594
<v Speaker 1>psychological account for the emergence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of science as a discipline is a very </v>

543
00:31:53.651 --> 00:31:55.200
<v Speaker 1>strange practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

544
00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:56.043
<v Speaker 1>you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to narrow your interests </v>

545
00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.120
<v Speaker 1>tremendously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To be a scientist,</v>

546
00:32:01.121 --> 00:32:01.954
<v Speaker 1>you have to focus on one set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena you know that might appear as </v>

547
00:32:05.291 --> 00:32:08.830
<v Speaker 1>useless to contemplate is how many </v>
<v Speaker 1>angels can dance on the head of a pin.</v>

548
00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:09.843
<v Speaker 1>You have to devote decades to the study </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that thing to make incremental </v>

549
00:32:12.701 --> 00:32:13.534
<v Speaker 1>process or progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why in the world would people ever be </v>

550
00:32:16.301 --> 00:32:18.490
<v Speaker 1>motivated to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

551
00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:19.333
<v Speaker 1>young interpretation was well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a deep counter movement </v>

552
00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:23.013
<v Speaker 1>towards the over spiritualization of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche and that was the revaluation of </v>

553
00:32:27.311 --> 00:32:32.311
<v Speaker 1>matter and its possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While Nisha believe that Christianity as</v>

554
00:32:32.861 --> 00:32:33.694
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it stood at the end of the 18 </v>

555
00:32:34.811 --> 00:32:35.644
<v Speaker 1>hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was an untenable philosophy because he </v>

556
00:32:37.511 --> 00:32:42.511
<v Speaker 1>thought it had abandoned moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>obligations by escaping into some beyond</v>

557
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:46.160
<v Speaker 1>and therefore damned life as it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually lived by human big.</v>

558
00:32:46.161 --> 00:32:48.110
<v Speaker 1>So he felt that the device was a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

559
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:52.063
<v Speaker 1>He he points out one other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the difference between </v>

560
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:58.130
<v Speaker 1>having a theory and then learning to </v>
<v Speaker 1>theorize.</v>

561
00:32:58.131 --> 00:32:58.850
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

562
00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:02.270
<v Speaker 1>if you've been raised in a tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that tradition happens to be,</v>

563
00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:03.373
<v Speaker 1>you have a belief system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever that belief system happens to </v>

564
00:33:05.451 --> 00:33:08.360
<v Speaker 1>be and it falls apart on you at any one </v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

565
00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:09.673
<v Speaker 1>you suffer for two reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first is your belief system fell </v>

566
00:33:13.011 --> 00:33:13.844
<v Speaker 1>apart and that's not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It leaves everything unfixed and open </v>

567
00:33:18.081 --> 00:33:18.914
<v Speaker 1>and you drown in possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a sense that's a character guardian </v>

568
00:33:21.171 --> 00:33:23.720
<v Speaker 1>phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the second consequences,</v>

569
00:33:23.721 --> 00:33:24.554
<v Speaker 1>even worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you've learned that one belief </v>

570
00:33:26.211 --> 00:33:28.880
<v Speaker 1>system that's solid could be demolished </v>
<v Speaker 1>and fall apart,</v>

571
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:29.923
<v Speaker 1>then it's very difficult ever again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have any faith in any belief systems </v>

572
00:33:32.481 --> 00:33:33.314
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So not only do you become a doubter of </v>

573
00:33:35.901 --> 00:33:39.320
<v Speaker 1>your own creed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you become a metadata which is</v>

574
00:33:39.321 --> 00:33:40.970
<v Speaker 1>the doubter of all belief systems.</v>

575
00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:44.180
<v Speaker 1>While in the step from that to nihilism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe those are exactly the same thing.</v>

576
00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:45.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's really,</v>

577
00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:46.483
<v Speaker 1>you could think about that in some sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the disease of the critical rational </v>

578
00:33:49.611 --> 00:33:50.444
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can saw off any branch that it's </v>

579
00:33:52.581 --> 00:33:53.414
<v Speaker 1>sitting on and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the utility of that is leave no stone </v>

580
00:33:57.011 --> 00:33:57.831
<v Speaker 1>unturned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

581
00:33:57.831 --> 00:33:58.664
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to question things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the utility of that is you learn new </v>

582
00:34:01.161 --> 00:34:01.994
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the price you paid for it is that </v>

583
00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:08.320
<v Speaker 1>you're not necessarily ever certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>about anything and you know,</v>

584
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.051
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

585
00:34:09.051 --> 00:34:11.330
<v Speaker 1>maybe you shouldn't be certain about </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

586
00:34:11.331 --> 00:34:13.640
<v Speaker 1>but you know you can forget that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know you're.</v>

587
00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:17.930
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to act as if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain many times in your life for when</v>

588
00:34:17.931 --> 00:34:20.270
<v Speaker 1>you choose a permanent mate for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

589
00:34:20.271 --> 00:34:21.104
<v Speaker 1>if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you probably will because your </v>

590
00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:26.030
<v Speaker 1>university educated and university </v>
<v Speaker 1>educated people still do that,</v>

591
00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:27.133
<v Speaker 1>although no one else does so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to pick a career and </v>

592
00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:33.170
<v Speaker 1>you're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to make decisions one after</v>

593
00:34:33.171 --> 00:34:36.530
<v Speaker 1>the other about which if you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain you can't make,</v>

594
00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:40.790
<v Speaker 1>in which case you have no life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just a whirlwind of chaos.</v>

595
00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:42.133
<v Speaker 1>So you're stuck with the necessity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>following a course of action which is </v>

596
00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:51.160
<v Speaker 1>acted out certainty that your intellect </v>
<v Speaker 1>can not regard as appropriate and that's</v>

597
00:34:51.411 --> 00:34:52.244
<v Speaker 1>hard on people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why should I choose this instead of </v>

598
00:34:54.741 --> 00:34:55.574
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why should I act this way instead of </v>

599
00:34:57.861 --> 00:34:59.620
<v Speaker 1>that way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

600
00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:01.693
<v Speaker 1>I don't know is not a very useful answer</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're a creature that's is </v>

601
00:35:04.581 --> 00:35:09.581
<v Speaker 1>cognitively able as we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a brilliant.</v>

602
00:35:13.341 --> 00:35:15.770
<v Speaker 1>This is an absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something absolutely brilliant.</v>

603
00:35:15.771 --> 00:35:18.230
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult for me to believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was written</v>

604
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:21.143
<v Speaker 1>so long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is Dostoyevsky's criticism of </v>

605
00:35:25.501 --> 00:35:26.334
<v Speaker 1>communism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forty years before communism was a </v>

606
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:30.833
<v Speaker 1>political force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Dostoevsky's thinking really hard </v>

607
00:35:33.931 --> 00:35:35.850
<v Speaker 1>about this nihilism problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

608
00:35:35.851 --> 00:35:39.060
<v Speaker 1>nature read Dostoevsky extensively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's thinking about,</v>

609
00:35:39.061 --> 00:35:39.894
<v Speaker 1>he thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

610
00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:44.400
<v Speaker 1>there seems to be two alternatives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is this superhuman nihilism,</v>

611
00:35:44.401 --> 00:35:48.300
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of a variant of what needs</v>
<v Speaker 1>you propose because nature proposed that</v>

612
00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:51.313
<v Speaker 1>it would become the responsibility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>every human being after the death of </v>

613
00:35:54.351 --> 00:35:57.470
<v Speaker 1>their religious tradition to establish </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own values.</v>

614
00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:02.360
<v Speaker 1>Now you think that's it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't think people could do it.</v>

615
00:36:02.361 --> 00:36:03.194
<v Speaker 1>He thought there'd have to be a new kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of person who could manage it because </v>

616
00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:06.913
<v Speaker 1>you know he's basically asking you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>generate a coherent and pragmatically </v>

617
00:36:11.781 --> 00:36:16.530
<v Speaker 1>applicable philosophical structure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of nothing during your lifetime.</v>

618
00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:17.331
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

619
00:36:17.331 --> 00:36:18.880
<v Speaker 1>good luck with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

620
00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:19.963
<v Speaker 1>Plus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he also assumed that people create </v>

621
00:36:21.351 --> 00:36:25.460
<v Speaker 1>values or that they could create values </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know that's true to some degree,</v>

622
00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:26.533
<v Speaker 1>and we'll talk about this more when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>get into the phenomenal logical end of </v>

623
00:36:28.851 --> 00:36:30.710
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not self evident,</v>

624
00:36:30.711 --> 00:36:33.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things you may notice</v>

625
00:36:33.441 --> 00:36:35.840
<v Speaker 1>is that you can't force yourself to love</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

626
00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:37.573
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just decide that you're going </v>

627
00:36:38.071 --> 00:36:39.560
<v Speaker 1>to value someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then poof,</v>

628
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:41.240
<v Speaker 1>that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

629
00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:42.523
<v Speaker 1>you may want with all your heart as far </v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least with all your mind to value </v>

630
00:36:45.561 --> 00:36:48.440
<v Speaker 1>someone because they deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've never mistreated you.</v>

631
00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:51.230
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you've said you'd be loyal to them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and poof,</v>

632
00:36:51.231 --> 00:36:52.064
<v Speaker 1>someone comes along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're tremendously attracted to them </v>

633
00:36:53.541 --> 00:36:54.950
<v Speaker 1>and off you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

634
00:36:56.440 --> 00:37:00.130
<v Speaker 1>like someone who's possessed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

635
00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:03.310
<v Speaker 1>did you create that value?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

636
00:37:03.311 --> 00:37:05.320
<v Speaker 1>well it didn't closer to your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

637
00:37:05.321 --> 00:37:06.154
<v Speaker 1>Like can you actually make yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in something your board </v>

638
00:37:08.831 --> 00:37:11.710
<v Speaker 1>about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like good luck trying that,</v>

639
00:37:11.711 --> 00:37:12.544
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd rather clean up underneath your </v>

640
00:37:13.331 --> 00:37:15.340
<v Speaker 1>bed than read a paper you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>read.</v>

641
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:17.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you can't just tell yourself,</v>

642
00:37:17.411 --> 00:37:18.244
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to read this paper for the </v>

643
00:37:18.911 --> 00:37:20.590
<v Speaker 1>following reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Poof,</v>

644
00:37:20.591 --> 00:37:22.510
<v Speaker 1>it becomes interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

645
00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:22.931
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

646
00:37:22.931 --> 00:37:24.820
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your value systems,</v>

647
00:37:24.821 --> 00:37:27.790
<v Speaker 1>whatever they happen to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're off doing their own thing and the</v>

648
00:37:27.791 --> 00:37:28.624
<v Speaker 1>reason for that in large part is because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're possessed by ideas that you </v>

649
00:37:31.241 --> 00:37:32.074
<v Speaker 1>don't know about that have these </v>
<v Speaker 1>historical roots and that play you in </v>

650
00:37:35.561 --> 00:37:39.250
<v Speaker 1>some sense like they play puppets and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff is no joke.</v>

651
00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:41.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is what Dostoevsky said way back</v>

652
00:37:41.891 --> 00:37:44.430
<v Speaker 1>in the late 18 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was in a book called a</v>

653
00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:50.610
<v Speaker 1>notes from underground and it's about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>man who's like hamlet in some sense.</v>

654
00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:52.490
<v Speaker 1>He's a modern man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

655
00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:53.343
<v Speaker 1>he's a 20th century man really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his problem is he's hyper </v>

656
00:37:56.841 --> 00:37:59.580
<v Speaker 1>intelligent and he can't figure out what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hell he should do with his life.</v>

657
00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:00.623
<v Speaker 1>And it's really bothering him and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse than that because not only is it </v>

658
00:38:03.631 --> 00:38:06.930
<v Speaker 1>really bothering him that he can't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>his act together and act with any degree</v>

659
00:38:06.931 --> 00:38:09.090
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of consistency and character,</v>

660
00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:10.943
<v Speaker 1>but he knows that he can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he tortures himself about his </v>

661
00:38:12.961 --> 00:38:15.930
<v Speaker 1>weakness at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's a very neurotic character,</v>

662
00:38:15.931 --> 00:38:18.630
<v Speaker 1>but he's a sophisticated and intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 1>neurotic.</v>

663
00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:19.793
<v Speaker 1>And so he's run through all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments that you might conjure up to </v>

664
00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:25.830
<v Speaker 1>sort of talk yourself out of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurotic and suffering.</v>

665
00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:28.050
<v Speaker 1>He has nothing but contempt for his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

666
00:38:28.051 --> 00:38:32.130
<v Speaker 1>He thinks he's much weaker than people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who can just act without thinking.</v>

667
00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:34.620
<v Speaker 1>And he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in this pip,</v>

668
00:38:34.621 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 1>this horrible pit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a lot.</v>

669
00:38:36.041 --> 00:38:39.580
<v Speaker 1>It's a wonderful thing to read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite blockly comical.</v>

670
00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:42.850
<v Speaker 1>And it's a great philosophical and </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological study.</v>

671
00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:46.690
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the sections of this book,</v>

672
00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:51.691
<v Speaker 1>niches or Dostoevsky's protagonist </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to talk about alternatives to his</v>

673
00:38:52.571 --> 00:38:53.890
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopelessness.</v>

674
00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:57.760
<v Speaker 1>And he thinks about utopianism as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential alternative.</v>

675
00:38:57.761 --> 00:39:00.190
<v Speaker 1>So what's the utopianism?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

676
00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:03.533
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medieval Christianity promised people </v>

677
00:39:08.741 --> 00:39:09.574
<v Speaker 1>redemption after they died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while the Utopian creed does the same </v>

678
00:39:13.061 --> 00:39:15.940
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except it promises it here and now.</v>

679
00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:19.540
<v Speaker 1>So that's communism was a particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>utopian.</v>

680
00:39:19.541 --> 00:39:22.660
<v Speaker 1>Crete and fascism had the same element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although it was,</v>

681
00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:29.140
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

682
00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:32.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was less intellectually sophisticated</v>

683
00:39:32.321 --> 00:39:34.900
<v Speaker 1>than communism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Communism is basically said,</v>

684
00:39:34.901 --> 00:39:35.734
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you guys just stop being selfish and </v>

685
00:39:37.691 --> 00:39:38.524
<v Speaker 1>share,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can transform the world into a place </v>

686
00:39:41.531 --> 00:39:42.364
<v Speaker 1>where everyone will have enough of </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and everyone will be able to </v>

687
00:39:45.581 --> 00:39:49.810
<v Speaker 1>do what they want to do and because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the natural goodness of people,</v>

688
00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.390
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if selfishness can be overcome,</v>

689
00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:54.970
<v Speaker 1>that'll be the next best thing to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>paradise.</v>

690
00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:58.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like it was powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a powerful idea for people.</v>

691
00:39:58.661 --> 00:39:59.494
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>80 years of our history was spent </v>

692
00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:08.680
<v Speaker 1>assessing and battling out the validity </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that idea and hundreds of millions of</v>

693
00:40:08.681 --> 00:40:10.420
<v Speaker 1>people died as a consequence of it.</v>

694
00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:14.350
<v Speaker 1>And you can understand why it was so </v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive.</v>

695
00:40:14.351 --> 00:40:15.184
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still utopian ideologies are attractive </v>

696
00:40:17.491 --> 00:40:18.324
<v Speaker 1>to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

697
00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.313
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to read radical Islam is </v>

698
00:40:20.671 --> 00:40:23.370
<v Speaker 1>anything other than a Utopian ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

699
00:40:23.371 --> 00:40:26.490
<v Speaker 1>the idea is once you establish rigid </v>
<v Speaker 1>sharia,</v>

700
00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:28.740
<v Speaker 1>then poof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

701
00:40:28.741 --> 00:40:31.860
<v Speaker 1>you've got the Kingdom of God on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

702
00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:36.960
<v Speaker 1>and part of the reason that the radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslims are fighting against the West is</v>

703
00:40:36.961 --> 00:40:41.961
<v Speaker 1>because they see what they're doing as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>counter position to western nihilism.</v>

704
00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:45.510
<v Speaker 1>And it's partly because they don't want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fall into that,</v>

705
00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:47.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would say,</v>

706
00:40:47.131 --> 00:40:48.720
<v Speaker 1>well that's progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

707
00:40:48.721 --> 00:40:49.554
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's progress by our standards and it </v>

708
00:40:53.311 --> 00:40:56.070
<v Speaker 1>comes at a price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also we don't even understand how it</v>

709
00:40:56.071 --> 00:40:56.904
<v Speaker 1>was that we paid the price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the reason I'm telling you this is </v>

710
00:41:01.651 --> 00:41:02.484
<v Speaker 1>because you don't want to be thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>for any time at all that these sorts of </v>

711
00:41:05.131 --> 00:41:07.530
<v Speaker 1>issues have disappeared or that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not relevant.</v>

712
00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:11.610
<v Speaker 1>They're relevant now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy who's advising potent,</v>

713
00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:16.860
<v Speaker 1>his name is Alexander do and he's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>admirer of Western liberalism,</v>

714
00:41:16.861 --> 00:41:19.110
<v Speaker 1>he thinks about it as fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic.</v>

715
00:41:19.111 --> 00:41:19.944
<v Speaker 1>He thinks that it's universal </v>
<v Speaker 1>application would result in the </v>

716
00:41:22.951 --> 00:41:23.784
<v Speaker 1>disillusion of all local culture and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>production of this sort of </v>

717
00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:30.690
<v Speaker 1>materialistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hyper individuality.</v>

718
00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:34.670
<v Speaker 1>And he's an admirer of tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

719
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:37.610
<v Speaker 1>and specifically Russian Orthodox </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition.</v>

720
00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:40.310
<v Speaker 1>And he believes that the cult cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>India,</v>

721
00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and China in particular,</v>

722
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:43.243
<v Speaker 1>should develop their own local cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep the West the hell out and act as a </v>

723
00:41:47.181 --> 00:41:49.370
<v Speaker 1>counter position to nihilistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberalism.</v>

724
00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say what you want about that.</v>

725
00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:56.540
<v Speaker 1>I think [inaudible] biggest problem is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

726
00:41:57.310 --> 00:41:58.143
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't want that diverse ideas that </v>

727
00:42:01.101 --> 00:42:04.760
<v Speaker 1>characterize the west to bump up against</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia and dissolve it,</v>

728
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.983
<v Speaker 1>but what he fails to understand is those</v>
<v Speaker 1>same ideas are going to emerge within </v>

729
00:42:08.871 --> 00:42:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Russia anyways and if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to keep them away outside,</v>

730
00:42:13.521 --> 00:42:14.354
<v Speaker 1>you have to keep them away inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Soviets already tried that for </v>

731
00:42:17.331 --> 00:42:18.164
<v Speaker 1>70 years with pretty dire results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think he can get around the </v>

732
00:42:21.591 --> 00:42:23.420
<v Speaker 1>problem merely by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

733
00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:24.700
<v Speaker 1>putting up walls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

734
00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:30.600
<v Speaker 1>but he's going to try and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>Putin is doing.</v>

735
00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:32.730
<v Speaker 1>So these ideas haven't disappeared at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

736
00:42:32.731 --> 00:42:35.610
<v Speaker 1>Like they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They underlie all of the great conflicts</v>

737
00:42:35.611 --> 00:42:38.700
<v Speaker 1>that characterize the modern age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

738
00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:42.990
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky criticized utopianism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's brilliant his,</v>

739
00:42:42.991 --> 00:42:46.920
<v Speaker 1>his formulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to read it to you in short.</v>

740
00:42:46.921 --> 00:42:49.260
<v Speaker 1>One may say anything about the history </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world,</v>

741
00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:53.640
<v Speaker 1>anything that might enter the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>disordered imagination.</v>

742
00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:57.210
<v Speaker 1>The only thing one can't say is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's rational.</v>

743
00:42:57.630 --> 00:43:02.630
<v Speaker 1>The very word sticks in one's throat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And indeed this is the odd thing that is</v>

744
00:43:02.641 --> 00:43:03.474
<v Speaker 1>continually happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are continually turning up in </v>

745
00:43:05.461 --> 00:43:07.560
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral and rational persons,</v>

746
00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:08.483
<v Speaker 1>sages and lovers of humanity who may get</v>
<v Speaker 1>their object to live all their lives as </v>

747
00:43:12.781 --> 00:43:15.600
<v Speaker 1>morally and rationally as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be so,</v>

748
00:43:15.601 --> 00:43:16.434
<v Speaker 1>to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a light to their neighbors simply in </v>

749
00:43:18.391 --> 00:43:19.224
<v Speaker 1>order to show them that it is possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>to live morally and rationally in this </v>

750
00:43:21.871 --> 00:43:22.704
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet we all know that these very </v>

751
00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:27.750
<v Speaker 1>people sooner or later have been false </v>
<v Speaker 1>to themselves playing some queer trick,</v>

752
00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:29.850
<v Speaker 1>often most unseemly one.</v>

753
00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:35.660
<v Speaker 1>Now I asked you what can be expected of </v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

754
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:38.960
<v Speaker 1>since he is a being endowed with such </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange qualities,</v>

755
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:42.140
<v Speaker 1>shower upon him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every earthly blessing,</v>

756
00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:47.240
<v Speaker 1>drowning in a sea of happiness so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing but bubbles of bliss can be seen</v>

757
00:43:47.241 --> 00:43:49.520
<v Speaker 1>on the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give them economic prosperity,</v>

758
00:43:49.521 --> 00:43:51.770
<v Speaker 1>such that he should have nothing else to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

759
00:43:51.771 --> 00:43:52.604
<v Speaker 1>but sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat cakes and busy himself with the </v>

760
00:43:55.551 --> 00:43:59.720
<v Speaker 1>continuation of his species and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>then out of sheer and gratitude,</v>

761
00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:03.740
<v Speaker 1>sheer spite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man would play you some nasty trick.</v>

762
00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:04.753
<v Speaker 1>He would even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Risk is cakes and with deliberately </v>

763
00:44:06.891 --> 00:44:10.970
<v Speaker 1>desire the most fatal rubbish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most uneconomical absurdity,</v>

764
00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:13.970
<v Speaker 1>simply to introduce into all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive,</v>

765
00:44:13.971 --> 00:44:15.740
<v Speaker 1>good sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his fatal,</v>

766
00:44:15.741 --> 00:44:20.150
<v Speaker 1>fantastic element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just as fantastic dreams is vulgar,</v>

767
00:44:20.151 --> 00:44:20.984
<v Speaker 1>folly that he will desire to retain </v>
<v Speaker 1>simply in order to prove to himself as </v>

768
00:44:24.951 --> 00:44:25.784
<v Speaker 1>though that were so necessary that men </v>
<v Speaker 1>still are men and not the keys of a </v>

769
00:44:29.811 --> 00:44:30.644
<v Speaker 1>piano,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which the laws of nature threatened to </v>

770
00:44:32.401 --> 00:44:33.234
<v Speaker 1>control completely so completely that </v>
<v Speaker 1>one will be able to desire nothing but </v>

771
00:44:36.691 --> 00:44:37.524
<v Speaker 1>by the calendar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so clearly that's Dostoyevsky's </v>

772
00:44:40.951 --> 00:44:44.220
<v Speaker 1>criticism of materialistic determinism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

773
00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:47.640
<v Speaker 1>which he felt as a spiritual threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>

774
00:44:47.641 --> 00:44:51.180
<v Speaker 1>it's proposition being that animals and </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>

775
00:44:51.181 --> 00:44:52.014
<v Speaker 1>we're deterministic machines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a Newtonian worldview and that </v>

776
00:44:54.931 --> 00:44:55.764
<v Speaker 1>because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything could be calculated and </v>

777
00:44:56.941 --> 00:45:00.720
<v Speaker 1>planned ahead of time because it could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be predicted and measured,</v>

778
00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:04.313
<v Speaker 1>and that is not all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if men really were nothing but a </v>

779
00:45:06.421 --> 00:45:07.254
<v Speaker 1>piano key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if this were proved to him by </v>

780
00:45:09.361 --> 00:45:12.780
<v Speaker 1>natural science and mathematics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even then he would not become reasonable</v>

781
00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:14.093
<v Speaker 1>but would purposely do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>perverse out of simple in gratitude </v>

782
00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:18.203
<v Speaker 1>simply to gain his point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if he does not find means he will </v>

783
00:45:21.511 --> 00:45:24.810
<v Speaker 1>contrive destruction and chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sufferings of all sorts,</v>

784
00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:25.673
<v Speaker 1>only to gain his point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll launch a curse upon the world and </v>

785
00:45:29.581 --> 00:45:30.414
<v Speaker 1>as the only man can curse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this privilege and the primary </v>

786
00:45:33.661 --> 00:45:35.490
<v Speaker 1>distinction between him and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

787
00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:36.713
<v Speaker 1>maybe by his curse alone he will attain </v>
<v Speaker 1>is object and convinced himself that </v>

788
00:45:39.631 --> 00:45:40.464
<v Speaker 1>he's a man and not a piano key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you say that all this too can be </v>

789
00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:45.293
<v Speaker 1>calculated and tabulated chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 1>darkness and curses so that the mere </v>

790
00:45:48.721 --> 00:45:51.990
<v Speaker 1>possibility of calculating it all </v>
<v Speaker 1>beforehand would stop.</v>

791
00:45:51.991 --> 00:45:56.820
<v Speaker 1>It all and reason would reassert itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That man would purposely go mad in order</v>

792
00:45:56.821 --> 00:45:59.850
<v Speaker 1>to be rid of reason and gain his point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in it.</v>

793
00:45:59.851 --> 00:46:00.684
<v Speaker 1>I answer for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the whole work of man really seems </v>

794
00:46:02.281 --> 00:46:06.840
<v Speaker 1>to consist of nothing but proving to </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself every minute that he's a man and</v>

795
00:46:06.841 --> 00:46:10.230
<v Speaker 1>not a piano key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may be at the cost of his skin,</v>

796
00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:12.660
<v Speaker 1>it might be by cannibalism</v>

797
00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:15.343
<v Speaker 1>and this being sold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can one help being tempted to rejoice </v>

798
00:46:18.111 --> 00:46:18.944
<v Speaker 1>that it has not yet come off and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>desire still depends on something we </v>

799
00:46:21.681 --> 00:46:26.681
<v Speaker 1>don't know you will scream at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is if you condescend to do so,</v>

800
00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.273
<v Speaker 1>that no one's touching my freewill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all they're concerned with is that </v>

801
00:46:30.981 --> 00:46:35.600
<v Speaker 1>my will should have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should have itself of its own freewill,</v>

802
00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:40.040
<v Speaker 1>coincide with my own normal interests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the laws of nature and arithmetic.</v>

803
00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:42.200
<v Speaker 1>Good Evans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gentlemen,</v>

804
00:46:42.201 --> 00:46:43.034
<v Speaker 1>what sort of free will is left when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>come to tabulation and arithmetic when </v>

805
00:46:46.101 --> 00:46:48.920
<v Speaker 1>it will all be a case of twice two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes four,</v>

806
00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.233
<v Speaker 1>twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two makes four without my will as a </v>

807
00:46:53.181 --> 00:46:58.181
<v Speaker 1>freewill meant that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's his point?</v>

808
00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:02.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of a garden of eden point.</v>

809
00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:06.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are people like magine?</v>

810
00:47:06.931 --> 00:47:09.150
<v Speaker 1>You could reconstruct a paradise on </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

811
00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:11.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically,</v>

812
00:47:11.011 --> 00:47:11.844
<v Speaker 1>that's what everyone wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could go live in the paradise and </v>

813
00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:16.290
<v Speaker 1>that would be the end of the problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd all live happily ever after.</v>

814
00:47:16.291 --> 00:47:21.291
<v Speaker 1>But in the original paradise story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what people were provided with.</v>

815
00:47:21.541 --> 00:47:22.374
<v Speaker 1>And the first thing they did when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were put there was to do the one thing </v>

816
00:47:24.901 --> 00:47:25.734
<v Speaker 1>that they were told not to do that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring it all crashing down and that was </v>

817
00:47:28.291 --> 00:47:29.124
<v Speaker 1>immediately what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so Dostoevsky story's actually a </v>

818
00:47:32.171 --> 00:47:33.004
<v Speaker 1>retelling of that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea was that that people aren't </v>

819
00:47:35.771 --> 00:47:39.760
<v Speaker 1>like the utopians think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want it easy,</v>

820
00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:42.970
<v Speaker 1>we don't want it comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to good.</v>

821
00:47:42.971 --> 00:47:46.260
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is we'd be bored</v>
<v Speaker 1>stiff and so the defendant,</v>

822
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:47.103
<v Speaker 1>nobody ever did put us in the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nursery that would require us never to </v>

823
00:47:50.771 --> 00:47:54.160
<v Speaker 1>exert any effort to do anything at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever ever again.</v>

824
00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:57.430
<v Speaker 1>Even if it meant going insane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we destroy it.</v>

825
00:47:58.270 --> 00:48:00.070
<v Speaker 1>And then he takes that further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says.</v>

826
00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:01.960
<v Speaker 1>And that's a good thing.</v>

827
00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:04.943
<v Speaker 1>Kierkegaard writing earlier about 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years earlier said something quite </v>

828
00:48:08.191 --> 00:48:09.024
<v Speaker 1>similar.</v>

829
00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:13.730
<v Speaker 1>It is now about four years ago that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>got the notion of wanting to try my luck</v>

830
00:48:13.731 --> 00:48:16.070
<v Speaker 1>as an author.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember it quite clearly.</v>

831
00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:17.960
<v Speaker 1>It was on a Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

832
00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:19.790
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Sunday afternoon.</v>

833
00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:23.990
<v Speaker 1>I was seated as usual out of doors at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cafe in the Fredericksburg Garden.</v>

834
00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:27.890
<v Speaker 1>I had been a student for half a score of</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

835
00:48:29.090 --> 00:48:29.923
<v Speaker 1>although never lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All my activity nevertheless was like a </v>

836
00:48:32.511 --> 00:48:33.344
<v Speaker 1>glittering inactivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kind of occupation for which I still </v>

837
00:48:36.081 --> 00:48:39.980
<v Speaker 1>have a great partiality and for which </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps are even have a little genius.</v>

838
00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:41.443
<v Speaker 1>I read much spent the remainder of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day idling and thinking or thinking an </v>

839
00:48:45.411 --> 00:48:47.210
<v Speaker 1>idling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was all it came to.</v>

840
00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:48.513
<v Speaker 1>So there I sat and smoke my cigar until </v>
<v Speaker 1>I lapsed into thought among other </v>

841
00:48:52.491 --> 00:48:55.550
<v Speaker 1>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember these you are going on.</v>

842
00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:56.773
<v Speaker 1>I said to myself to become an old man </v>
<v Speaker 1>without being anything and really </v>

843
00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:03.200
<v Speaker 1>without undertaking to do anything.</v>

844
00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:04.843
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever you look about you and </v>

845
00:49:06.021 --> 00:49:06.854
<v Speaker 1>literature and in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the celebrated names and </v>

846
00:49:08.421 --> 00:49:09.254
<v Speaker 1>figures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the precious and much heralded men who </v>

847
00:49:11.701 --> 00:49:14.210
<v Speaker 1>were coming into prominence and are much</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about,</v>

848
00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:15.523
<v Speaker 1>the many benefactors of the age who knew</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to benefit mankind by making life </v>

849
00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:20.530
<v Speaker 1>easier and easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some by railways,</v>

850
00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:24.200
<v Speaker 1>others by omnibuses and steamboats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>others by the telegraph,</v>

851
00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:25.573
<v Speaker 1>others by easily apprehended compendiums</v>
<v Speaker 1>and short recitals of everything worth </v>

852
00:49:28.641 --> 00:49:29.474
<v Speaker 1>knowing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and finding the true benefactors of the </v>

853
00:49:32.151 --> 00:49:36.170
<v Speaker 1>age who makes spiritual existence in </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtue of thought easier and easier,</v>

854
00:49:36.350 --> 00:49:40.910
<v Speaker 1>yet more and more significant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what are you doing here?</v>

855
00:49:40.911 --> 00:49:42.470
<v Speaker 1>My soliloquy was interrupted</v>

856
00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:49.130
<v Speaker 1>for a cigar with smoked out and a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>one had to be lit so I smoked again,</v>

857
00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:52.100
<v Speaker 1>and then suddenly this thought flashed </v>
<v Speaker 1>through my mind,</v>

858
00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:54.283
<v Speaker 1>you must do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in as much as with your limited </v>

859
00:49:56.961 --> 00:49:57.794
<v Speaker 1>capacities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be impossible to make anything </v>

860
00:49:59.151 --> 00:49:59.984
<v Speaker 1>easier than it has become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must with the same humanitarian </v>

861
00:50:03.291 --> 00:50:07.520
<v Speaker 1>enthusiasm as the others undertake to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make something harder.</v>

862
00:50:08.810 --> 00:50:11.000
<v Speaker 1>This notion pleased me immensely and at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time,</v>

863
00:50:11.001 --> 00:50:11.834
<v Speaker 1>it flattered me to think that I liked </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of them would be loved in the </v>

864
00:50:14.551 --> 00:50:15.384
<v Speaker 1>steam by the whole community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for when all combined in every way to </v>

865
00:50:18.471 --> 00:50:22.580
<v Speaker 1>make everything easier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there remains only one possible danger,</v>

866
00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:27.680
<v Speaker 1>namely that the eas becomes so great </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it becomes all together.</v>

867
00:50:27.681 --> 00:50:28.514
<v Speaker 1>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

868
00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:31.790
<v Speaker 1>Then there's only one want left though </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is not yet felt want,</v>

869
00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:32.953
<v Speaker 1>when people will want difficulty out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>love for mankind and out of despair at </v>

870
00:50:37.551 --> 00:50:38.384
<v Speaker 1>my embarrassing situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing that I had accomplished nothing </v>

871
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.863
<v Speaker 1>and was unable to make anything easier </v>
<v Speaker 1>than it has already been made and moved </v>

872
00:50:44.991 --> 00:50:47.390
<v Speaker 1>by a genuine interest in those who make </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything easy.</v>

873
00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:52.400
<v Speaker 1>I can save it as my task to create </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficulties everywhere.</v>

874
00:50:54.850 --> 00:50:56.740
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you might ask yourself</v>

875
00:50:56.741 --> 00:50:57.574
<v Speaker 1>is</v>

876
00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:03.870
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you come to university and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people talk about happiness.</v>

877
00:51:03.871 --> 00:51:05.940
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talk about positive psychology.</v>

878
00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:08.303
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a fan of positive psychology by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way because happiness is basically </v>

879
00:51:11.641 --> 00:51:15.540
<v Speaker 1>extroversion minus neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we knew that 15 years ago,</v>

880
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:18.090
<v Speaker 1>so we didn't need to make a lot of noise</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

881
00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:23.700
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you might ask yourself</v>

882
00:51:23.701 --> 00:51:24.240
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

883
00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:25.073
<v Speaker 1>why did you come to university?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you actually come to university to </v>

884
00:51:27.091 --> 00:51:30.370
<v Speaker 1>make yourself happier?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

885
00:51:30.371 --> 00:51:35.371
<v Speaker 1>let's think about that for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's one thing to think about.</v>

886
00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:41.680
<v Speaker 1>We know if that if you put animals in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively boring situation like rats in</v>

887
00:51:41.681 --> 00:51:44.620
<v Speaker 1>a boarding situation and you give them </v>
<v Speaker 1>free access to cocaine,</v>

888
00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:48.460
<v Speaker 1>they'll just take cocaine until they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>dead basically.</v>

889
00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:50.980
<v Speaker 1>Now it wraps in the normal environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Won't do that,</v>

890
00:51:50.981 --> 00:51:51.814
<v Speaker 1>but board rats that are sort of isolated</v>
<v Speaker 1>cocaine's really an excellent thing as </v>

891
00:51:54.971 --> 00:51:56.500
<v Speaker 1>far as they're concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll ignore sex.</v>

892
00:51:56.501 --> 00:51:57.334
<v Speaker 1>They'll ignore food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they'll still drink water if I </v>

893
00:51:59.681 --> 00:52:00.514
<v Speaker 1>remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's cocaine all the way and if you </v>

894
00:52:03.191 --> 00:52:05.800
<v Speaker 1>could inject an electrode into their </v>
<v Speaker 1>minds,</v>

895
00:52:05.801 --> 00:52:07.600
<v Speaker 1>their brains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which people have done,</v>

896
00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:11.590
<v Speaker 1>you can inject the electrode down into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hypothalamus,</v>

897
00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.920
<v Speaker 1>into the part that's associated with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reward centers.</v>

898
00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:16.593
<v Speaker 1>It's the source of the dopaminergic </v>
<v Speaker 1>tracts and you can set them up so that </v>

899
00:52:19.841 --> 00:52:20.674
<v Speaker 1>if the rat pushes a button,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get a little jolt of of happiness </v>

900
00:52:23.530 --> 00:52:27.310
<v Speaker 1>basically in the rattle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sit there and push that happiness button</v>

901
00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:29.553
<v Speaker 1>in a rather frantic way as if it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for something else in some </v>

902
00:52:32.531 --> 00:52:34.750
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it will certainly do it just because</v>

903
00:52:34.751 --> 00:52:37.390
<v Speaker 1>it's a peculiar kind of reward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the question might be,</v>

904
00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:40.150
<v Speaker 1>would you allow yourself to be wired up </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that?</v>

905
00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:43.773
<v Speaker 1>Now you might think there might be some </v>
<v Speaker 1>times in your life where you think that </v>

906
00:52:45.641 --> 00:52:47.920
<v Speaker 1>might just be a perfectly fine idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of you,</v>

907
00:52:47.921 --> 00:52:51.550
<v Speaker 1>I suppose I pursue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't do that for a second,</v>

908
00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:55.840
<v Speaker 1>for the same reasons perhaps that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't avail yourself of unlimited access</v>

909
00:52:55.841 --> 00:52:56.674
<v Speaker 1>to cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very a stimulant that's very </v>

910
00:52:58.811 --> 00:52:59.644
<v Speaker 1>good at producing positive emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a powerful psychomotor stimulants </v>

911
00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:03.933
<v Speaker 1>and so it affects the parts of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain that are active when you're doing </v>

912
00:53:06.881 --> 00:53:09.190
<v Speaker 1>something that you think is worthwhile </v>
<v Speaker 1>and productive,</v>

913
00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:10.413
<v Speaker 1>so why not just do that all the time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the question that Elvis Huxley's </v>

914
00:53:13.570 --> 00:53:16.270
<v Speaker 1>brave new world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got Everything you want.</v>

915
00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:19.690
<v Speaker 1>Take a drug to keep you calm and happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poof.</v>

916
00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:20.583
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

917
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:22.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what you want?</v>

918
00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:26.250
<v Speaker 1>And if the answer is no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you might ask yourself,</v>

919
00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:29.670
<v Speaker 1>what the hell do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

920
00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:34.880
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I've thought a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>about lately is lately being 10 years,</v>

921
00:53:35.221 --> 00:53:38.430
<v Speaker 1>I suppose is there are these statutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've seen,</v>

922
00:53:38.431 --> 00:53:39.990
<v Speaker 1>I've looked at pictures of them online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

923
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.690
<v Speaker 1>statues of Atlas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

924
00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:42.533
<v Speaker 1>an atlas is this God who has the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>on his shoulders and that's his destiny </v>

925
00:53:46.471 --> 00:53:49.260
<v Speaker 1>or is cursed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to have the world on his shoulders.</v>

926
00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:50.580
<v Speaker 1>And he might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

927
00:53:50.581 --> 00:53:51.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor atlas,</v>

928
00:53:51.451 --> 00:53:54.000
<v Speaker 1>maybe just put the damn world down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

929
00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:56.400
<v Speaker 1>go out for a beer or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

930
00:53:57.510 --> 00:54:00.330
<v Speaker 1>but then you might also think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

931
00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:03.180
<v Speaker 1>what is that figure trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

932
00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:06.330
<v Speaker 1>That idea of trying to indicate because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an old idea.</v>

933
00:54:06.331 --> 00:54:07.164
<v Speaker 1>It's a profound idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something divine about a figure </v>

934
00:54:10.111 --> 00:54:11.580
<v Speaker 1>with the world on his shoulders.</v>

935
00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:13.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might say the real.</v>

936
00:54:13.631 --> 00:54:15.810
<v Speaker 1>That's the reason you're in university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether you know it or not.</v>

937
00:54:17.010 --> 00:54:17.843
<v Speaker 1>You're here to take the world on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulders because that's a sufficiently </v>

938
00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:22.493
<v Speaker 1>profound and worthwhile exercise so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the suffering that you're going to </v>

939
00:54:26.671 --> 00:54:27.504
<v Speaker 1>have might be regarded as worthwhile </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the value of what you're doing </v>

940
00:54:32.251 --> 00:54:34.350
<v Speaker 1>is so high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what you might ask,</v>

941
00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:39.380
<v Speaker 1>is there something that you could do </v>
<v Speaker 1>whose value is so high that the fact for</v>

942
00:54:40.291 --> 00:54:41.124
<v Speaker 1>the existentialists existentialists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fact that you're mortal and </v>

943
00:54:45.301 --> 00:54:50.301
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable and prone to suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>inescapably that you would find that not</v>

944
00:54:50.911 --> 00:54:53.280
<v Speaker 1>only acceptable but desirable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd say,</v>

945
00:54:53.281 --> 00:54:55.170
<v Speaker 1>I'll pay that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I paid that price.</v>

946
00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:57.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an existential question.</v>

947
00:54:58.320 --> 00:54:59.153
<v Speaker 1>You might say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the existential question and one </v>

948
00:55:01.891 --> 00:55:04.200
<v Speaker 1>of the things that's very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that question is,</v>

949
00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:07.513
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk about this a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next class is what happens if you make </v>

950
00:55:09.841 --> 00:55:14.150
<v Speaker 1>the opposite choice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

951
00:55:14.151 --> 00:55:14.984
<v Speaker 1>I think the 20th century actually showed</v>
<v Speaker 1>us what happened when people made the </v>

952
00:55:17.301 --> 00:55:20.900
<v Speaker 1>opposite choice because as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell,</v>

953
00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:26.230
<v Speaker 1>when people abandoned their</v>
<v Speaker 1>divine responsibility,</v>

954
00:55:26.751 --> 00:55:27.584
<v Speaker 1>let's say</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the Utopian claims of a totalitarian </v>

955
00:55:31.881 --> 00:55:32.714
<v Speaker 1>state or too hopeless nihilism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the consequences on the one hand with </v>

956
00:55:37.311 --> 00:55:38.144
<v Speaker 1>nihilism was despair and illness and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence on the totalitarian end of </v>

957
00:55:44.091 --> 00:55:46.940
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Utopian end was that while you might</v>

958
00:55:46.941 --> 00:55:47.774
<v Speaker 1>not die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're certainly going to have a </v>

959
00:55:48.621 --> 00:55:51.080
<v Speaker 1>hand in making sure that a lot of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people do,</v>

960
00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:57.820
<v Speaker 1>and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose it to some degree,</v>

961
00:55:59.341 --> 00:56:04.341
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what you want for proof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no proof with regards to what you should</v>

962
00:56:04.381 --> 00:56:05.214
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the conclusion I've drawn from all </v>

963
00:56:07.771 --> 00:56:10.320
<v Speaker 1>this from reading the existentialist is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

964
00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:14.033
<v Speaker 1>if it's the pointless suffering of </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity and the inability to extract </v>

965
00:56:18.481 --> 00:56:19.314
<v Speaker 1>meaning from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes you a nihilist and that </v>

966
00:56:20.971 --> 00:56:24.190
<v Speaker 1>justifies it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you're making a claim,</v>

967
00:56:24.191 --> 00:56:25.240
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The claim is</v>

968
00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:31.020
<v Speaker 1>the implicit claim is that suffering is </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad and should be halted.</v>

969
00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:31.973
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that and so maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll do that by becoming suicidal or </v>

970
00:56:34.861 --> 00:56:38.310
<v Speaker 1>maybe you do that by becoming ultimately</v>
<v Speaker 1>genocidal,</v>

971
00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:42.000
<v Speaker 1>which is also an option that's open to </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than a few people,</v>

972
00:56:42.990 --> 00:56:45.840
<v Speaker 1>but there's a logical inconsistency in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as far as I can tell,</v>

973
00:56:45.841 --> 00:56:46.674
<v Speaker 1>which is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>your initial presupposition is that </v>

974
00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:52.930
<v Speaker 1>suffering is actually bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be mitigated.</v>

975
00:56:52.931 --> 00:56:55.120
<v Speaker 1>It should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be reduced.</v>

976
00:56:55.121 --> 00:56:57.390
<v Speaker 1>It should perhaps even be eliminated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

977
00:56:57.550 --> 00:56:58.383
<v Speaker 1>if you pick up the cloak of nihilism or </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you pick up the cloak of </v>

978
00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:01.873
<v Speaker 1>ideological totalitarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we know what the consequence of </v>

979
00:57:05.351 --> 00:57:06.184
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the consequences that everything that's </v>

980
00:57:08.321 --> 00:57:12.760
<v Speaker 1>already really bad becomes so much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse that it's almost unimaginable</v>

981
00:57:14.610 --> 00:57:19.350
<v Speaker 1>and so even by the standards of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gnarliest who says that the suffering of</v>

982
00:57:19.351 --> 00:57:24.351
<v Speaker 1>being should result in its elimination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the consequences of thinking that way or</v>

983
00:57:26.971 --> 00:57:27.804
<v Speaker 1>a flipping to the other side and </v>
<v Speaker 1>adopting some sort of defensive </v>

984
00:57:29.881 --> 00:57:30.714
<v Speaker 1>videology is that things go from being </v>
<v Speaker 1>merely the sort of bad state of the </v>

985
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:36.503
<v Speaker 1>earth as it is now to something as </v>
<v Speaker 1>hellish as the Soviet gulags are the </v>

986
00:57:39.961 --> 00:57:40.794
<v Speaker 1>Russian concentration camps or miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great experiment in the Cultural </v>

987
00:57:44.490 --> 00:57:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Revolution which probably killed 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million people know about,</v>

988
00:57:48.211 --> 00:57:52.640
<v Speaker 1>which we generally hear nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

989
00:57:52.650 --> 00:57:53.483
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things the existentialists </v>

990
00:57:54.411 --> 00:57:55.244
<v Speaker 1>would say is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the relationship between mental </v>

991
00:57:59.541 --> 00:58:03.350
<v Speaker 1>health and responsibility?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that.</v>

992
00:58:03.370 --> 00:58:04.203
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question because it also </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to do something with something like </v>

993
00:58:07.101 --> 00:58:09.710
<v Speaker 1>the definition of mental health and </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

994
00:58:09.711 --> 00:58:10.544
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

995
00:58:15.130 --> 00:58:17.530
<v Speaker 1>if you want your life to be well </v>
<v Speaker 1>constituted,</v>

996
00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:20.440
<v Speaker 1>let's say whatever that means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't mean being happy,</v>

997
00:58:21.590 --> 00:58:24.180
<v Speaker 1>they see the reason it can mean being </v>
<v Speaker 1>happiest.</v>

998
00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:25.023
<v Speaker 1>There's gonna be times in your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're going to be called on to </v>

999
00:58:26.621 --> 00:58:30.580
<v Speaker 1>act when you're not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1000
00:58:30.850 --> 00:58:34.330
<v Speaker 1>when one of your parents dies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to make a choice.</v>

1001
00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:36.790
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That will not be,</v>

1002
00:58:36.791 --> 00:58:38.770
<v Speaker 1>oh well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully you won't be otherwise.</v>

1003
00:58:38.771 --> 00:58:40.840
<v Speaker 1>You're tangled in some sort of Freud a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nightmare,</v>

1004
00:58:40.841 --> 00:58:42.550
<v Speaker 1>but let's assume that that's not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>

1005
00:58:42.730 --> 00:58:43.563
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to be happy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be hurt and maybe even </v>

1006
00:58:46.451 --> 00:58:47.284
<v Speaker 1>partly broken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what the hell are you supposed to do </v>

1007
00:58:49.031 --> 00:58:49.864
<v Speaker 1>then?</v>

1008
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:51.703
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer is you should be more use </v>

1009
00:58:52.791 --> 00:58:55.790
<v Speaker 1>than trouble under some certain under </v>
<v Speaker 1>such circumstances,</v>

1010
00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:57.740
<v Speaker 1>and that's a good thing to strive for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1011
00:58:57.920 --> 00:58:59.870
<v Speaker 1>because your mother is going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's your father,</v>

1012
00:58:59.871 --> 00:59:01.740
<v Speaker 1>your mother is going to be equally </v>
<v Speaker 1>distraught and sore,</v>

1013
00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:04.190
<v Speaker 1>your siblings and everyone else you care</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

1014
00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:05.233
<v Speaker 1>Maybe by that time you should be tough </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough so that in that situation you're </v>

1015
00:59:08.031 --> 00:59:08.864
<v Speaker 1>good for something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone has to make the damn funeral </v>

1016
00:59:10.941 --> 00:59:13.880
<v Speaker 1>arrangements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone has to settle out the will.</v>

1017
00:59:14.090 --> 00:59:14.923
<v Speaker 1>Someone has to make sure the family </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't degenerate into horrific </v>

1018
00:59:18.081 --> 00:59:18.914
<v Speaker 1>squabbling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something that often happens </v>

1019
00:59:20.211 --> 00:59:21.044
<v Speaker 1>after the death of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're not going to be motivated to </v>

1020
00:59:24.291 --> 00:59:27.530
<v Speaker 1>do that by happiness and what if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a sick child when you're.</v>

1021
00:59:27.590 --> 00:59:31.040
<v Speaker 1>When you're a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a chronic illness.</v>

1022
00:59:31.041 --> 00:59:32.780
<v Speaker 1>You are not going to be happy about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1023
00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:34.003
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll be a weight that you carry with </v>

1024
00:59:35.241 --> 00:59:37.660
<v Speaker 1>you all the time and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1025
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:40.520
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things that seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly unjust.</v>

1026
00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:41.601
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1027
00:59:41.601 --> 00:59:45.860
<v Speaker 1>well you're no longer happy with being </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy is the purpose of life.</v>

1028
00:59:45.861 --> 00:59:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Well then you're basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty much it for you,</v>

1029
00:59:48.231 --> 00:59:52.670
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know these catastrophes that I'm</v>

1030
00:59:52.671 --> 00:59:54.290
<v Speaker 1>speaking of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>

1031
00:59:54.610 --> 00:59:55.443
<v Speaker 1>You can be certain that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be exposed to many of those during your </v>

1032
00:59:59.031 --> 01:00:00.620
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1033
01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:01.573
<v Speaker 1>it'll be a rare period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a rare period in anyone's </v>

1034
01:00:03.861 --> 01:00:08.630
<v Speaker 1>life where one or more of such things </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't going on chronically.</v>

1035
01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:09.573
<v Speaker 1>If it's not you with some terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>health problem or some other terrible </v>

1036
01:00:12.561 --> 01:00:13.394
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's a parent or a sibling or a </v>

1037
01:00:15.231 --> 01:00:16.064
<v Speaker 1>child or because you know you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected to other people and they're </v>

1038
01:00:18.291 --> 01:00:21.980
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the law of human beings and so</v>

1039
01:00:21.981 --> 01:00:24.770
<v Speaker 1>if it's happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what Solzhenitsyn said about</v>

1040
01:00:24.771 --> 01:00:25.604
<v Speaker 1>happiness to it's said happiness is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy who's brought to ruin by the </v>

1041
01:00:30.771 --> 01:00:33.770
<v Speaker 1>first blow of a guard's truncheon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1042
01:00:33.771 --> 01:00:34.730
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

1043
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:37.520
<v Speaker 1>That's about as bluntly as you can put </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1044
01:00:47.090 --> 01:00:47.923
<v Speaker 2>Here's another.</v>

1045
01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:53.193
<v Speaker 1>I have time to read both of these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is from character guard as </v>

1046
01:00:55.211 --> 01:00:59.990
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kierkegaard,</v>

1047
01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:00.863
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was really the first thinker who </v>

1048
01:01:01.711 --> 01:01:05.430
<v Speaker 1>identified what we would describe in </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern terms as anxiety,</v>

1049
01:01:05.431 --> 01:01:09.120
<v Speaker 1>especially as existential existential </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety or anxious,</v>

1050
01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:10.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it would be associated with the </v>

1051
01:01:11.851 --> 01:01:14.520
<v Speaker 1>condition of questioning the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence,</v>

1052
01:01:14.521 --> 01:01:15.354
<v Speaker 1>the utility of existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so kierkegaard was really the first </v>

1053
01:01:17.611 --> 01:01:19.550
<v Speaker 1>person who formalized that into </v>
<v Speaker 1>something</v>

1054
01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:25.660
<v Speaker 1>resembling a philosophy or a psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he was trying to think of how,</v>

1055
01:01:25.690 --> 01:01:28.650
<v Speaker 1>how that might be overcome given that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed to be rooted,</v>

1056
01:01:28.651 --> 01:01:29.484
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in factual observation that that's the </v>

1057
01:01:31.321 --> 01:01:36.321
<v Speaker 1>observation of suffering</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a corollary to Dostoyevsky's</v>

1058
01:01:36.591 --> 01:01:39.670
<v Speaker 1>comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though character guards,</v>

1059
01:01:39.671 --> 01:01:41.320
<v Speaker 1>comments were written decades earlier.</v>

1060
01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Dostoyevsky's critique basically said </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't solve the problem of suffering</v>

1061
01:01:49.321 --> 01:01:54.321
<v Speaker 1>by formalizing a utopia and then joining</v>
<v Speaker 1>it like a mass animal.</v>

1062
01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:56.700
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that because you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of creature.</v>

1063
01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Even if it was possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't accept it.</v>

1064
01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:02.010
<v Speaker 1>You'd cause trouble because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in trouble.</v>

1065
01:02:02.550 --> 01:02:05.760
<v Speaker 1>You're probably more interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in trouble than you are and being happy.</v>

1066
01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:08.280
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1067
01:02:08.281 --> 01:02:11.760
<v Speaker 1>people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another marker often have serious</v>

1068
01:02:11.761 --> 01:02:13.060
<v Speaker 1>personality disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1069
01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:13.933
<v Speaker 1>I have clients have many of them who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>way more interested in causing trouble </v>

1070
01:02:18.541 --> 01:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>in some way than they are and being </v>
<v Speaker 1>boring and stable.</v>

1071
01:02:23.310 --> 01:02:24.143
<v Speaker 1>They'll take any form of suffering and </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflict any form of suffering on any </v>

1072
01:02:26.881 --> 01:02:27.714
<v Speaker 1>number of people they can possibly get </v>
<v Speaker 1>their hooks into in order to merely to </v>

1073
01:02:30.451 --> 01:02:31.850
<v Speaker 1>escape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1074
01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:34.580
<v Speaker 1>drab and secure normality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1075
01:02:34.581 --> 01:02:39.060
<v Speaker 1>you call those people dramatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overly dramatic.</v>

1076
01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:43.830
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of looking at it and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>make as far as I can tell,</v>

1077
01:02:43.831 --> 01:02:48.831
<v Speaker 1>a relatively conscious choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trouble is more interesting than safety.</v>

1078
01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Character Guard says something similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a,</v>

1079
01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:59.590
<v Speaker 1>in a more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a more pop,</v>

1080
01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:00.563
<v Speaker 1>in a morph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say in a manner that's </v>

1081
01:03:02.971 --> 01:03:03.804
<v Speaker 1>more constructive in some sense with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to what you should do with all </v>

1082
01:03:06.871 --> 01:03:07.704
<v Speaker 1>that in St Energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're not going to be able to </v>

1083
01:03:08.971 --> 01:03:13.971
<v Speaker 1>encapsulate inside a utopia and it has </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with individual responsibility.</v>

1084
01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:19.410
<v Speaker 1>There is a view of life which conceives </v>
<v Speaker 1>that where the crowd is,</v>

1085
01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:23.040
<v Speaker 1>there is also the truth and that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth itself,</v>

1086
01:03:23.041 --> 01:03:25.050
<v Speaker 1>there is need of having the crowd on its</v>
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>

1087
01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:26.213
<v Speaker 1>I was on a panel at one point about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we were discussing gender </v>

1088
01:03:30.241 --> 01:03:31.074
<v Speaker 1>differences between obviously between </v>
<v Speaker 1>men and women and there are lots of </v>

1089
01:03:35.461 --> 01:03:37.740
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the social constructionist in particular</v>

1090
01:03:37.741 --> 01:03:38.574
<v Speaker 1>who think that all of the differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's biological sex and then there's </v>

1091
01:03:41.041 --> 01:03:41.874
<v Speaker 1>gender and gender is socially </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed and that all gender </v>

1092
01:03:45.211 --> 01:03:46.044
<v Speaker 1>differences are socially constructed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no biological differences in </v>

1093
01:03:48.901 --> 01:03:50.670
<v Speaker 1>gender between the two sexes.</v>

1094
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Now virtually no evidence supports that </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition.</v>

1095
01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:57.240
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the hardcore </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological evidence,</v>

1096
01:03:57.241 --> 01:03:58.074
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's completely the opposite and not </v>

1097
01:03:59.071 --> 01:04:02.490
<v Speaker 1>only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you make societies more egalitarian,</v>

1098
01:04:02.850 --> 01:04:05.850
<v Speaker 1>men and women get more different instead</v>
<v Speaker 1>of more of the same.</v>

1099
01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:07.343
<v Speaker 1>Now the reason that happens is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>once the iron out the environmental </v>

1100
01:04:10.531 --> 01:04:12.990
<v Speaker 1>variability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by equalizing everything,</v>

1101
01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:14.033
<v Speaker 1>all that's left is genetic vulnerable </v>
<v Speaker 1>variability and so it springs to the </v>

1102
01:04:17.191 --> 01:04:21.300
<v Speaker 1>forefront and so the biggest gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences in the world are between men</v>

1103
01:04:21.301 --> 01:04:25.350
<v Speaker 1>and women in Scandinavia and those are </v>
<v Speaker 1>partly personality differences.</v>

1104
01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:28.950
<v Speaker 1>Women are higher in negative emotion and</v>
<v Speaker 1>more agreeable among other things,</v>

1105
01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:30.053
<v Speaker 1>but more particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the differences seem to be a those of </v>

1106
01:04:33.121 --> 01:04:33.954
<v Speaker 1>interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the biggest differences between men </v>

1107
01:04:36.691 --> 01:04:39.780
<v Speaker 1>and women seem to be in what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in and roughly speaking,</v>

1108
01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.390
<v Speaker 1>women are more interested in people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

1109
01:04:42.391 --> 01:04:43.800
<v Speaker 1>men are more interested in things.</v>

1110
01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:48.180
<v Speaker 1>And so in Scandinavia for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a 20 to one proportion of women</v>

1111
01:04:48.181 --> 01:04:49.014
<v Speaker 1>to men in nursing and at 21 to one </v>
<v Speaker 1>proportion of men to women in </v>

1112
01:04:52.561 --> 01:04:53.394
<v Speaker 1>engineering and so and you know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavian governments now and then </v>

1113
01:04:56.971 --> 01:04:57.804
<v Speaker 1>try to move that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's more male nurses and more </v>

1114
01:04:59.581 --> 01:05:02.760
<v Speaker 1>female engineers and if they really push</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can move.</v>

1115
01:05:02.761 --> 01:05:03.594
<v Speaker 1>The ratio is somewhat for a few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as they relax they snap </v>

1116
01:05:06.541 --> 01:05:09.930
<v Speaker 1>right back to 20 to one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1117
01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:11.783
<v Speaker 1>I was saving some of these studies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the people that I was discussing </v>

1118
01:05:14.790 --> 01:05:15.623
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what are we supposed to do with </v>

1119
01:05:18.701 --> 01:05:20.110
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

1120
01:05:20.111 --> 01:05:21.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you mean.</v>

1121
01:05:21.041 --> 01:05:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Those are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are scientific findings said,</v>

1122
01:05:23.831 --> 01:05:24.664
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but truth has to be established by </v>

1123
01:05:25.841 --> 01:05:28.540
<v Speaker 1>consensus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

1124
01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:29.553
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to live in whatever world </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to end up ruling because </v>

1125
01:05:32.591 --> 01:05:33.424
<v Speaker 1>truth is not merely established by </v>
<v Speaker 1>consensus or if you think it does and </v>

1126
01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:37.333
<v Speaker 1>you think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then while you're in the position that </v>

1127
01:05:38.861 --> 01:05:39.694
<v Speaker 1>character guard describes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that as long as everyone else </v>

1128
01:05:42.551 --> 01:05:44.740
<v Speaker 1>believes that the appropriate thing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you to believe it.</v>

1129
01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:45.573
<v Speaker 1>And also that's the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a pretty damn dismal </v>

1130
01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:52.570
<v Speaker 1>philosophy and it gets people into </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous trouble because no matter how</v>

1131
01:05:52.571 --> 01:05:54.670
<v Speaker 1>many people think there isn't a wall </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1132
01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:58.240
<v Speaker 1>anyone who runs out it had first is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a vicious surprise.</v>

1133
01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:00.333
<v Speaker 1>There's a view of life which conceives </v>
<v Speaker 1>that where the crowd is there is also </v>

1134
01:06:02.321 --> 01:06:05.590
<v Speaker 1>the truth and in that truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an in truth itself.</v>

1135
01:06:05.591 --> 01:06:07.480
<v Speaker 1>There is need of having the crowd on its</v>
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>

1136
01:06:07.810 --> 01:06:09.670
<v Speaker 1>There's another view of life which </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceives that.</v>

1137
01:06:09.671 --> 01:06:12.250
<v Speaker 1>Wherever there is a crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is untruth</v>

1138
01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:18.310
<v Speaker 1>so that to consider for a moment the </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme case,</v>

1139
01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:23.020
<v Speaker 1>even if every individual each for </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself in private,</v>

1140
01:06:23.530 --> 01:06:24.363
<v Speaker 1>we're to be in possession of the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet in case they're all to get together </v>

1141
01:06:28.271 --> 01:06:29.104
<v Speaker 1>in a crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a crowd to which any sort of decisive </v>

1142
01:06:30.941 --> 01:06:33.580
<v Speaker 1>significance as attributed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>avoiding voting,</v>

1143
01:06:33.730 --> 01:06:34.563
<v Speaker 1>noisy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>audible crowd untruth would immediately </v>

1144
01:06:36.641 --> 01:06:37.540
<v Speaker 1>be in evidence</v>

1145
01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:41.093
<v Speaker 1>for crowd is untruth in a godly sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is true eternally Christianly as St </v>

1146
01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:47.753
<v Speaker 1>Paul says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that only one attains the goal which is </v>

1147
01:06:49.381 --> 01:06:53.370
<v Speaker 1>not meant in a comparative sense for </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparison takes others into account.</v>

1148
01:06:53.850 --> 01:06:57.810
<v Speaker 1>It means that every individual can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>that one God helping him there in,</v>

1149
01:06:57.811 --> 01:06:58.644
<v Speaker 1>but only one attains the goal and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this means that every man should be </v>

1150
01:07:01.831 --> 01:07:02.664
<v Speaker 1>careful about having to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>others and essentially should only talk </v>

1151
01:07:06.271 --> 01:07:09.330
<v Speaker 1>with God in himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for only one attains the goal,</v>

1152
01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:10.313
<v Speaker 1>and again this means that man or to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>man is akin to daddy in a worldly and </v>

1153
01:07:15.301 --> 01:07:17.790
<v Speaker 1>temporal sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be said by the man of bustle,</v>

1154
01:07:17.791 --> 01:07:18.624
<v Speaker 1>sociability and amicable illness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How unreasonable that only one attains </v>

1155
01:07:22.891 --> 01:07:23.724
<v Speaker 1>the goal for it is far more likely that </v>
<v Speaker 1>many by the strength of united effort </v>

1156
01:07:27.450 --> 01:07:28.283
<v Speaker 1>should attain the goal and when we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>many successes more certain and it is </v>

1157
01:07:31.501 --> 01:07:33.750
<v Speaker 1>easier for each man severally.</v>

1158
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:35.063
<v Speaker 1>True enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is far more likely and it is also </v>

1159
01:07:36.721 --> 01:07:39.510
<v Speaker 1>true with respect to all earthly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>material goods,</v>

1160
01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:42.990
<v Speaker 1>if it is allowed to have its way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

1161
01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:44.303
<v Speaker 1>this becomes the only true point of view</v>
<v Speaker 1>for desert way with God in eternity in </v>

1162
01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:48.073
<v Speaker 1>man's kinship with Daddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does away with it or transforms it </v>

1163
01:07:51.751 --> 01:07:54.690
<v Speaker 1>into a fable and puts in its place the </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern,</v>

1164
01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:58.980
<v Speaker 1>or we might say the old pagan notion </v>
<v Speaker 1>that to be a man is to belong to a race,</v>

1165
01:07:59.790 --> 01:08:00.623
<v Speaker 1>endowed with reason to belong to it as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>specimen so that the race or species is </v>

1166
01:08:04.321 --> 01:08:07.650
<v Speaker 1>higher than the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a hundred years before nazi-ism,</v>

1167
01:08:08.730 --> 01:08:11.160
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that there are more no </v>
<v Speaker 1>more individuals,</v>

1168
01:08:11.161 --> 01:08:11.994
<v Speaker 1>but only specimens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but eternity which arches over at high </v>

1169
01:08:16.131 --> 01:08:21.131
<v Speaker 1>above the temporal tranquil as the story</v>
<v Speaker 1>vault at night and God in heaven.</v>

1170
01:08:21.171 --> 01:08:22.004
<v Speaker 1>Who in the bliss of that sublime </v>
<v Speaker 1>tranquility holds in survey without the </v>

1171
01:08:25.491 --> 01:08:27.440
<v Speaker 1>least sense of dizziness at such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>height.</v>

1172
01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:32.000
<v Speaker 1>Those countless multitudes of men and </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows each single individual by name.</v>

1173
01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:36.650
<v Speaker 1>He the great examiner says that only one</v>
<v Speaker 1>attains the goal.</v>

1174
01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:42.710
<v Speaker 1>Kierkegaard was a Christian </v>
<v Speaker 1>existentialist Protestant.</v>

1175
01:08:43.310 --> 01:08:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Dusty [inaudible] was an Orthodox </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian,</v>

1176
01:08:45.351 --> 01:08:48.620
<v Speaker 1>existentialist and Nicha who was also an</v>
<v Speaker 1>existentialist,</v>

1177
01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:49.573
<v Speaker 1>was a perhaps the most effective anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian philosopher who's ever </v>

1178
01:08:53.031 --> 01:08:55.280
<v Speaker 1>existed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he made it one of his</v>

1179
01:08:56.520 --> 01:09:01.320
<v Speaker 1>conscious aims to take a hammer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that was foundational against</v>

1180
01:09:01.321 --> 01:09:02.154
<v Speaker 1>what was left of what was left at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity at the time that he </v>

1181
01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:05.633
<v Speaker 1>existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I'm telling you this is </v>

1182
01:09:06.781 --> 01:09:11.040
<v Speaker 1>because existentialism is a strange </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical.</v>

1183
01:09:14.790 --> 01:09:15.623
<v Speaker 1>It's a strange philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It brings people with very divergent </v>

1184
01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:22.230
<v Speaker 1>fundamental assumptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Together they share certain assumptions,</v>

1185
01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:27.180
<v Speaker 1>and one assumption is that life in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>essence is suffering,</v>

1186
01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:28.823
<v Speaker 1>and the second is that the individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>has a responsibility to adopt </v>

1187
01:09:32.491 --> 01:09:33.324
<v Speaker 1>responsibility in faith in the face of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that suffering and that that's the </v>

1188
01:09:36.271 --> 01:09:37.104
<v Speaker 1>proper response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The proper response isn't nihilism or </v>

1189
01:09:39.931 --> 01:09:42.480
<v Speaker 1>ideological possession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something else.</v>

1190
01:09:42.481 --> 01:09:44.910
<v Speaker 1>It's something that depends on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person themselves.</v>

1191
01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Nature draws the same conclusions as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kierkegaard.</v>

1192
01:09:49.170 --> 01:09:51.840
<v Speaker 1>A traveler who had seen many countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>in people's</v>

1193
01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:57.400
<v Speaker 1>and several continents was asked what </v>
<v Speaker 1>human traits he had found everywhere,</v>

1194
01:09:58.210 --> 01:10:01.090
<v Speaker 1>and he answered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men Are inclined to laziness.</v>

1195
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:05.090
<v Speaker 1>Some will feel that he might've said </v>
<v Speaker 1>with greater justice,</v>

1196
01:10:05.690 --> 01:10:10.690
<v Speaker 1>they're all timid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hide behind customs and opinions</v>

1197
01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:13.433
<v Speaker 1>at bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every human being knows very well that </v>

1198
01:10:14.551 --> 01:10:18.870
<v Speaker 1>he is in this world just once as </v>
<v Speaker 1>something unique and then no accident,</v>

1199
01:10:18.871 --> 01:10:19.704
<v Speaker 1>however strange we'll throw together a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second time into a unity such a curious </v>

1200
01:10:23.791 --> 01:10:26.010
<v Speaker 1>and diffuse perilla,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plurality.</v>

1201
01:10:27.970 --> 01:10:30.280
<v Speaker 1>He knows it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hides it like a bad conscience.</v>

1202
01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:32.253
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1203
01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:40.380
<v Speaker 1>The last lecture when we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Roger's not the video lecture,</v>

1204
01:10:40.381 --> 01:10:42.570
<v Speaker 1>but the last time I was talking to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Rogers,</v>

1205
01:10:42.571 --> 01:10:43.404
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about instrumental speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the speech that you engage </v>

1206
01:10:46.561 --> 01:10:47.394
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's inauthentic from a Rogerian </v>

1207
01:10:48.991 --> 01:10:49.824
<v Speaker 1>existentialist perspective when the goal</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this speech is to extract something </v>

1208
01:10:53.551 --> 01:10:54.384
<v Speaker 1>from someone or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The goal is not mere clarity of </v>

1209
01:10:57.331 --> 01:10:58.164
<v Speaker 1>communication and so what that means is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the speech becomes separate from </v>

1210
01:11:02.971 --> 01:11:03.804
<v Speaker 1>the person and the speech is being used </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a tool for what some element of the </v>

1211
01:11:07.861 --> 01:11:08.694
<v Speaker 1>person requires and that's the hiding </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind convention that niche is talking </v>

1212
01:11:14.011 --> 01:11:18.640
<v Speaker 1>about because</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people use instrumental speech,</v>

1213
01:11:18.641 --> 01:11:19.474
<v Speaker 1>they're almost always pursuing something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that other people have told them that </v>

1214
01:11:22.741 --> 01:11:24.960
<v Speaker 1>they should want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be status,</v>

1215
01:11:24.961 --> 01:11:27.060
<v Speaker 1>it might be career promotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be,</v>

1216
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:29.790
<v Speaker 1>well those are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are two of the two of the major.</v>

1217
01:11:30.150 --> 01:11:35.150
<v Speaker 1>It might be material progress of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts,</v>

1218
01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:42.093
<v Speaker 1>but it's only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only the problem is is that it's </v>

1219
01:11:43.901 --> 01:11:44.734
<v Speaker 1>only part of the person talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that part is the part gets fixated </v>

1220
01:11:49.481 --> 01:11:50.314
<v Speaker 1>on that local achievement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the part that is attempting to </v>

1221
01:11:53.981 --> 01:11:54.814
<v Speaker 1>inquire about what the truth might be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this particular situation and to </v>

1222
01:11:58.241 --> 01:11:59.074
<v Speaker 1>describe it as carefully as possible and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the clearest speech of the </v>

1223
01:12:02.621 --> 01:12:04.180
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1224
01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:05.253
<v Speaker 1>one of the premises of existential </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy is that that's the only </v>

1225
01:12:08.921 --> 01:12:10.240
<v Speaker 1>way you can be healthy.</v>

1226
01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:16.250
<v Speaker 1>You have to learn to speak and act as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole and your.</v>

1227
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:17.223
<v Speaker 1>You have to be directed towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and truth and the </v>

1228
01:12:20.411 --> 01:12:25.411
<v Speaker 1>consequences of not doing that will be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you will suffer pointlessly,</v>

1229
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:30.850
<v Speaker 1>which is the worst kind of suffering and</v>
<v Speaker 1>b,</v>

1230
01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:34.390
<v Speaker 1>which is worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll bring rack and ruin onto everyone</v>

1231
01:12:34.391 --> 01:12:36.580
<v Speaker 1>around you and it gets worse than that </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

1232
01:12:36.581 --> 01:12:40.540
<v Speaker 1>because if you do that long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only will you bring rock and ruin on</v>

1233
01:12:40.541 --> 01:12:42.550
<v Speaker 1>everyone around you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll want to,</v>

1234
01:12:45.450 --> 01:12:49.470
<v Speaker 1>and that seems at least potentially like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bad outcome.</v>

1235
01:12:51.650 --> 01:12:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

1236
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:56.720
<v Speaker 1>if you adopt a firm belief system that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will protect you from that,</v>

1237
01:12:56.721 --> 01:13:00.950
<v Speaker 1>it's like the terror management idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology protecting you from,</v>

1238
01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:03.890
<v Speaker 1>from death anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>

1239
01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:05.233
<v Speaker 1>it's a very hopeless philosophy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it basically suggests that the </v>

1240
01:13:10.101 --> 01:13:10.934
<v Speaker 1>only people reason people have beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 1>is because they're terrified without </v>

1241
01:13:13.551 --> 01:13:17.480
<v Speaker 1>them and that if they engage in any sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of heroic behavior,</v>

1242
01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:18.553
<v Speaker 1>it's merely a</v>
<v Speaker 1>facade that in the final analysis is </v>

1243
01:13:23.031 --> 01:13:25.190
<v Speaker 1>empty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although necessary.</v>

1244
01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:27.860
<v Speaker 1>That's where the idea of positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>illusion came from.</v>

1245
01:13:28.130 --> 01:13:28.963
<v Speaker 1>Essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that life is so terrible that </v>

1246
01:13:30.741 --> 01:13:33.020
<v Speaker 1>enlist you lie yourself into </v>
<v Speaker 1>tranquility.</v>

1247
01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:36.770
<v Speaker 1>You'll be mentally unstable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unhealthy.</v>

1248
01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a doctrine for which,</v>

1249
01:13:39.081 --> 01:13:41.060
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no real evidence,</v>

1250
01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:42.410
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the what</v>

1251
01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:48.380
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from fear of his neighbor who insists on</v>

1252
01:13:48.381 --> 01:13:49.214
<v Speaker 1>convention and veils himself with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what is it that compels the </v>

1253
01:13:51.771 --> 01:13:53.690
<v Speaker 1>individual human being to fear his </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighbor,</v>

1254
01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:58.790
<v Speaker 1>to think and act heard fashion and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be glad of himself as sense of shame,</v>

1255
01:13:58.791 --> 01:14:02.810
<v Speaker 1>perhaps in a few rare cases in the vast </v>
<v Speaker 1>majority,</v>

1256
01:14:02.811 --> 01:14:06.590
<v Speaker 1>it is the desire for comfort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inertia in short,</v>

1257
01:14:06.770 --> 01:14:09.500
<v Speaker 1>that inclination to laziness of which </v>
<v Speaker 1>the traveler spoke.</v>

1258
01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:12.400
<v Speaker 1>He's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men are even than they are timid,</v>

1259
01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:17.350
<v Speaker 1>and what they fear most is the troubles </v>
<v Speaker 1>with which any unconditional honesty and</v>

1260
01:14:17.351 --> 01:14:22.351
<v Speaker 1>nudity would burden them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only artists hate this slovenly life and</v>

1261
01:14:23.631 --> 01:14:27.050
<v Speaker 1>borrowed manners and loosely fitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions and unveiled the secret.</v>

1262
01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:27.973
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's bad conscience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The principle that every human being is </v>

1263
01:14:30.471 --> 01:14:31.820
<v Speaker 1>a unique wonder.</v>

1264
01:14:33.730 --> 01:14:34.563
<v Speaker 1>They dare to show us the human being as </v>
<v Speaker 1>he is down to the last muscle himself </v>

1265
01:14:37.721 --> 01:14:39.490
<v Speaker 1>and himself alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even more.</v>

1266
01:14:39.491 --> 01:14:42.310
<v Speaker 1>That in this rigorous consistency of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>uniqueness,</v>

1267
01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:46.870
<v Speaker 1>he is beautiful and worth contemplating </v>
<v Speaker 1>as novel and incredible as every work of</v>

1268
01:14:46.871 --> 01:14:51.040
<v Speaker 1>nature and by no means dull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a great thinker despises man,</v>

1269
01:14:51.190 --> 01:14:53.570
<v Speaker 1>it's their laziness that he despises </v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

1270
01:14:53.571 --> 01:14:54.404
<v Speaker 1>It is an account on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is on account of this that they have </v>

1271
01:14:57.161 --> 01:14:57.994
<v Speaker 1>the appearance of factory products and </v>
<v Speaker 1>appear indifferent and not worthy of </v>

1272
01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:02.553
<v Speaker 1>companionship or instruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The human being who does not wish to </v>

1273
01:15:05.621 --> 01:15:09.400
<v Speaker 1>belong to the mass must merely cease </v>
<v Speaker 1>being comfortable with himself.</v>

1274
01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:12.640
<v Speaker 1>Let him follow his conscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which shouts at him.</v>

1275
01:15:13.870 --> 01:15:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Be Yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you're presently doing,</v>

1276
01:15:19.810 --> 01:15:22.090
<v Speaker 1>opining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and desiring</v>

1277
01:15:24.670 --> 01:15:25.720
<v Speaker 1>that is not really you.</v>

1278
01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:31.633
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1279
01:15:32.890 --> 01:15:33.920
<v Speaker 1>That's good place to start.</v>

1280
01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:39.353
<v Speaker 3>See you Thursday.</v>
