1
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.863
<v Speaker 1>Dear a Dr. Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please forgive me and this goes for </v>

2
00:00:26.471 --> 00:00:29.500
<v Speaker 1>whatever audience this video might </v>
<v Speaker 1>attract for reading this,</v>

3
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.503
<v Speaker 1>but I need to make this quick and </v>
<v Speaker 1>coherent and this is the fastest way of </v>

4
00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:38.770
<v Speaker 1>doing so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to address some of the issues</v>

5
00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:42.010
<v Speaker 1>that I believe made our discussion both </v>
<v Speaker 1>more trying and less valuable.</v>

6
00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:42.844
<v Speaker 1>That might've been a problem that many </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the people who now listened to it </v>

7
00:00:46.721 --> 00:00:47.554
<v Speaker 1>rightly identify.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that our discussion would </v>

8
00:00:51.581 --> 00:00:52.414
<v Speaker 1>perhaps would be more productive if we </v>
<v Speaker 1>started from the realization that we're </v>

9
00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.570
<v Speaker 1>both trying to address the same problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the relationship between science</v>

10
00:01:00.731 --> 00:01:01.564
<v Speaker 1>and ethics?</v>

11
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.263
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

12
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.203
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethics is nested inside scientific </v>

13
00:01:05.991 --> 00:01:06.824
<v Speaker 1>realism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now obviously that's a contentious </v>

14
00:01:09.591 --> 00:01:12.380
<v Speaker 1>claim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not the same as it being wrong,</v>

15
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.900
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that it's contentious re </v>
<v Speaker 1>David Hume and his problem with deriving</v>

16
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.560
<v Speaker 1>an art from an is means that there is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>real problem there.</v>

17
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.230
<v Speaker 1>I see scientific rate realism is nested </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside Darwinian competition,</v>

18
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.260
<v Speaker 1>at least potentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily.</v>

19
00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:32.094
<v Speaker 1>I could be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I am trying to address the real </v>

20
00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:35.514
<v Speaker 1>problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think the fact that you're </v>

21
00:01:38.171 --> 00:01:39.004
<v Speaker 1>addressing the science slash ethics </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem indicates that you see that </v>

22
00:01:42.071 --> 00:01:43.780
<v Speaker 1>there's a real problem there too.</v>

23
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

24
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.380
<v Speaker 1>I also think we only got to the problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>with my formulation,</v>

25
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.470
<v Speaker 1>not the problems with your solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

26
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:53.663
<v Speaker 1>the problem with measuring wellbeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you consider the enhancement of </v>

27
00:01:56.731 --> 00:01:58.740
<v Speaker 1>wellbeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proper and of ethics.</v>

28
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.173
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychological measures of wellbeing </v>

29
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.250
<v Speaker 1>currently used are almost only trait </v>
<v Speaker 1>extroversion minus trait neuroticism.</v>

30
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.993
<v Speaker 1>That's happiness minus sadness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's how well being is currently </v>

31
00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:14.490
<v Speaker 1>defined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

32
00:02:14.491 --> 00:02:18.450
<v Speaker 1>that proposition is faulty in every way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big problem.</v>

33
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.050
<v Speaker 1>It's a measurement problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a scientific realism problem.</v>

34
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.300
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

35
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.940
<v Speaker 1>we need better measures of wellbeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would say,</v>

36
00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:27.774
<v Speaker 1>well exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those will have to be nested inside </v>

37
00:02:30.481 --> 00:02:34.230
<v Speaker 1>the Darwinian conundrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How should we act in the world?</v>

38
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.463
<v Speaker 1>Here's an answer individually so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the family thrives at the family level </v>

39
00:02:42.811 --> 00:02:43.644
<v Speaker 1>so that society thrives at the societal </v>
<v Speaker 1>level so that the ecosystem thrives and </v>

40
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.520
<v Speaker 1>and not just today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow,</v>

41
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.430
<v Speaker 1>next week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next year and across time.</v>

42
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.073
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The developmental psychologist John </v>

43
00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.733
<v Speaker 1>Piaget was trying to address when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>studied the moral development of </v>

44
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:02.584
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Piaget was interested in solving the </v>

45
00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:07.510
<v Speaker 1>problem of the relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 1>science and ethics,</v>

46
00:03:07.511 --> 00:03:08.344
<v Speaker 1>and he looked how he looked at how </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethics in children emerged and </v>

47
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:14.530
<v Speaker 1>transformed into adulthood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what drove his entire life.</v>

48
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.610
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to formulate a scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution to the problem and ethics,</v>

49
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 1>and I've drawn a lot of my thinking from</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

50
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:22.700
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

51
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.700
<v Speaker 1>now I'm going to jump to a level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis,</v>

52
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:26.773
<v Speaker 1>and when I do so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will make many think I've gone off </v>

53
00:03:28.761 --> 00:03:33.380
<v Speaker 1>the rails of this argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ask for your indulgence.</v>

54
00:03:33.381 --> 00:03:36.500
<v Speaker 1>While I tried to put things together </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have not yet been put together,</v>

55
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.513
<v Speaker 1>this means that I have to present many </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas simultaneously as if looking at a </v>

56
00:03:41.301 --> 00:03:45.800
<v Speaker 1>picture or as if describing a picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is how these ideas have frequently</v>

57
00:03:45.801 --> 00:03:46.634
<v Speaker 1>been represented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The individual who acts in this </v>

58
00:03:50.451 --> 00:03:53.630
<v Speaker 1>equilibrated manner is the mythological </v>
<v Speaker 1>hero.</v>

59
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.890
<v Speaker 1>It's the mythological hero who confronts</v>
<v Speaker 1>the attention,</v>

60
00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.873
<v Speaker 1>the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a tension and intent to </v>

61
00:04:00.921 --> 00:04:04.550
<v Speaker 1>communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the archetypal hero who obtains the</v>

62
00:04:04.551 --> 00:04:07.880
<v Speaker 1>gold from the eternal dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dragon of chaos.</v>

63
00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.253
<v Speaker 1>That's an evolved representation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory but promising domain beyond </v>

64
00:04:13.521 --> 00:04:16.130
<v Speaker 1>the safety of the tree or the campfire.</v>

65
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:18.403
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

66
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.370
<v Speaker 1>It's the archetypal hero who distributes</v>
<v Speaker 1>the goal that he,</v>

67
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.220
<v Speaker 1>that he obtains from the dragon to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

68
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.593
<v Speaker 1>It's him who rescues the youthful virgin</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the predatory reptile that Saint </v>

69
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:30.880
<v Speaker 1>George,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the oldest story.</v>

70
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:31.714
<v Speaker 1>We know it's in the Enuma Elish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mesopotamian creation myth upon </v>

71
00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:37.830
<v Speaker 1>which the opening lines of genesis are </v>
<v Speaker 1>founded.</v>

72
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.290
<v Speaker 1>Can't you see an evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship</v>

73
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.830
<v Speaker 1>that's the archetypal hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's first a way of behaving.</v>

74
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.893
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a representation of that way of </v>

75
00:04:51.671 --> 00:04:53.980
<v Speaker 1>behaving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Third,</v>

76
00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:54.814
<v Speaker 1>it's a way of organizing society itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>around that action and representation </v>

77
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.063
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that society that then selects </v>

78
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.243
<v Speaker 1>through masculine competition for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best contender to that representation </v>

79
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.213
<v Speaker 1>and finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what is selected for by women who </v>

80
00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:15.400
<v Speaker 1>peel off the top of the masculine </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

81
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.353
<v Speaker 1>Women outsource the impossible cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>task of mate selection to the male </v>

82
00:05:20.621 --> 00:05:21.454
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hero emerges at the top of the </v>

83
00:05:24.821 --> 00:05:27.730
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets all the girls.</v>

84
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:29.463
<v Speaker 1>It's that what's it's that which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>selected for and he human females </v>

85
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.860
<v Speaker 1>perform part of the selection process </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

86
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.713
<v Speaker 1>Mother Nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the selection apparatus that choosy </v>

87
00:05:39.761 --> 00:05:42.160
<v Speaker 1>maters it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Female chimps or not.</v>

88
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.570
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

89
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:45.403
<v Speaker 1>The archetype will hero might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>regarded as a super meme in Richard </v>

90
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:50.143
<v Speaker 1>Dawkins terminology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been around so long that we have </v>

91
00:05:52.731 --> 00:05:53.564
<v Speaker 1>adapted biologically to its existence </v>
<v Speaker 1>just as we have in every way to the </v>

92
00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:02.450
<v Speaker 1>presence of the 300 million year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy,</v>

93
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.030
<v Speaker 1>which is more permanent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more real,</v>

94
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:05.864
<v Speaker 1>even from a strictly realist perspective</v>
<v Speaker 1>than such evanescent phenomena as </v>

95
00:06:09.771 --> 00:06:12.050
<v Speaker 1>amphibians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reptiles and mammals.</v>

96
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.790
<v Speaker 1>It's even older than trees.</v>

97
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

98
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:16.463
<v Speaker 1>The closer you are to that article hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more likely you are at least as a </v>

99
00:06:20.551 --> 00:06:21.384
<v Speaker 1>male to when the dominance hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 1>contest that makes you attractive to </v>

100
00:06:24.871 --> 00:06:25.704
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

101
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

102
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.880
<v Speaker 1>If Richard Dawkins who formulated the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of the meme was wiser,</v>

103
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:35.080
<v Speaker 1>he would have been Carl Young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An archetype is the ultimate meme.</v>

104
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:37.400
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

105
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.950
<v Speaker 1>In my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to have a real conversation.</v>

106
00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Not An argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that I think you're wrong,</v>

107
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.530
<v Speaker 1>it's that I think that there's a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem here,</v>

108
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:48.260
<v Speaker 1>which we both recognize and are both </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to solve.</v>

109
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.000
<v Speaker 1>If none of this makes even the least bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>of sense,</v>

110
00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:55.100
<v Speaker 1>if it doesn't at least peak your </v>
<v Speaker 1>curiosity,</v>

111
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.950
<v Speaker 1>if you can't see that we're obsessed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same problem,</v>

112
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.100
<v Speaker 1>then we won't be able to talk and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be a shame.</v>

113
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.400
<v Speaker 1>You're very sharp and precise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think in patterns somebody said,</v>

114
00:07:06.771 --> 00:07:07.604
<v Speaker 1>listening to us was like the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere of a single brain talking to </v>

115
00:07:10.431 --> 00:07:12.710
<v Speaker 1>the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good metaphor.</v>

116
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.533
<v Speaker 1>There wouldn't be so many people trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get us to talk if we didn't have </v>

117
00:07:16.941 --> 00:07:17.774
<v Speaker 1>something to discuss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The relationship between science and </v>

118
00:07:20.211 --> 00:07:21.044
<v Speaker 1>ethics is vitally important.</v>
