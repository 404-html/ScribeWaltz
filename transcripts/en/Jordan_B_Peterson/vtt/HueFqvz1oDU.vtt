1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:01.773
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.350
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to take another look at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure to begin with.</v>

3
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:10.063
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.403
<v Speaker 1>what are the reasons that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>began to think about these sorts of </v>

5
00:00:19.271 --> 00:00:20.104
<v Speaker 1>things just because I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what it might mean to have a </v>

6
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.990
<v Speaker 1>set of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

7
00:00:28.991 --> 00:00:33.970
<v Speaker 1>a set of values and beliefs because </v>
<v Speaker 1>those two things go together.</v>

8
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.010
<v Speaker 1>That would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess part of the question was,</v>

9
00:00:39.011 --> 00:00:39.844
<v Speaker 1>is it possible to develop a system of </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief that's outside of the realm of </v>

10
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:43.603
<v Speaker 1>videology no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because one thing you might claim is </v>

11
00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:47.734
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

12
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.150
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all ideology and belief system is,</v>

13
00:00:53.151 --> 00:00:53.984
<v Speaker 1>it is ideological and if you develop a </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief system that criticizes other </v>

14
00:00:58.561 --> 00:00:59.394
<v Speaker 1>belief systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just means that you've developed a </v>

15
00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:06.111
<v Speaker 1>new ideological stance and there's some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good argument.</v>

16
00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:07.974
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can think of a number of ways that </v>

17
00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:11.424
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things neat you said in the </v>

18
00:01:14.971 --> 00:01:19.290
<v Speaker 1>late 18 hundreds was that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabited the belief system,</v>

19
00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:23.010
<v Speaker 1>even a religious system and you lost </v>
<v Speaker 1>faith in it,</v>

20
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.580
<v Speaker 1>not only did you lose faith in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

21
00:01:26.581 --> 00:01:30.960
<v Speaker 1>but you also potentially lost faith in </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems themselves.</v>

22
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.970
<v Speaker 1>And so it was a medical apps in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only did you lose your belief,</v>

23
00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:39.870
<v Speaker 1>but you lost your belief in belief so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think of the set of all possible</v>

24
00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:44.720
<v Speaker 1>beliefs and then abandoning any hope of </v>
<v Speaker 1>relying on noses,</v>

25
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.530
<v Speaker 1>valid sources of information</v>

26
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:48.733
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

27
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's one perspective and it's a,</v>

28
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.193
<v Speaker 1>it's a powerful one and we need you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that that was a certain pathway </v>

29
00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:58.813
<v Speaker 1>denialism essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or perhaps to a reactionary </v>

30
00:02:01.741 --> 00:02:04.720
<v Speaker 1>totalitarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it boils down to the same thing.</v>

31
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.730
<v Speaker 1>I'd been reading this book</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>

32
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.820
<v Speaker 1>which the title of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember unfortunately,</v>

33
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.940
<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell it to you after class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

34
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.260
<v Speaker 1>it's a critique of certain lines of left</v>
<v Speaker 1>wing ideological thinking,</v>

35
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.170
<v Speaker 1>including the existential thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If people like John Paul Sartre and food</v>

36
00:02:29.681 --> 00:02:30.514
<v Speaker 1>co and one of the most trenchant </v>
<v Speaker 1>critiques of Sartre because he believes </v>

37
00:02:35.391 --> 00:02:39.050
<v Speaker 1>that you sort of have an absolute </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom that you're destined for freedom</v>

38
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.710
<v Speaker 1>that you're doing to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some sense,</v>

39
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.030
<v Speaker 1>part of your existential</v>
<v Speaker 1>journey is to establish an authenticity.</v>

40
00:02:49.521 --> 00:02:52.340
<v Speaker 1>That's correct for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't.</v>

41
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.733
<v Speaker 1>He isn't able really to give any </v>
<v Speaker 1>description of what that should be </v>

42
00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.613
<v Speaker 1>grounded in and the critic</v>
<v Speaker 1>concludes that all Sartre can do is </v>

43
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:12.211
<v Speaker 1>stand outside of any potential belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>system and criticize it and that that's,</v>

44
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.930
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing in it for anyone as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that.</v>

45
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:19.780
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only destructive now.</v>

46
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.530
<v Speaker 1>It's important to remember with regards </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Sartre that he viewed other people to</v>

47
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 1>some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the common man,</v>

48
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:29.014
<v Speaker 1>the bourgeoisie we might say as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>embodiment of non freedom of </v>

49
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.133
<v Speaker 1>inauthenticity and also as a barrier to </v>
<v Speaker 1>genuine authenticity so he wasn't </v>

50
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:43.420
<v Speaker 1>willing to give any credence to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>utility of normality,</v>

51
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.273
<v Speaker 1>but I also think he wasn't able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerate the consequences of his own </v>

52
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:48.694
<v Speaker 1>thought because he was a avid supporter </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the communist party far after anyone </v>

53
00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:56.800
<v Speaker 1>with any reasonable moral sense would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have stopped doing that.</v>

54
00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:57.634
<v Speaker 1>So sergeant really didn't denounce the </v>
<v Speaker 1>communists until the end of the </v>

55
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.621
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking.</v>

56
00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:05.020
<v Speaker 1>It was never a card carrying communist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was a very.</v>

57
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.210
<v Speaker 1>It was very left leaning and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

58
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.910
<v Speaker 1>by the 19 seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the late sixties,</v>

59
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.160
<v Speaker 1>by the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the early seventies,</v>

60
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:13.623
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the evidence about what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in Soviet Russia had been in </v>

61
00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:18.970
<v Speaker 1>for 30 years.</v>

62
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.073
<v Speaker 1>So there is really no excuse for not </v>
<v Speaker 1>facing up to that and trying to </v>

63
00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:28.540
<v Speaker 1>understand what it meant and it would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad enough if it was just Soviet Union,</v>

64
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:30.820
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't the same sort of thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

65
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.300
<v Speaker 1>Wherever those utopian pre a precept </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions were put into place.</v>

66
00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:40.210
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose many of you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

67
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:43.390
<v Speaker 1>but Paul Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was the Cambodian dictator,</v>

68
00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:47.260
<v Speaker 1>was educated at this sort of bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he wrote his thesis on the.</v>

69
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.430
<v Speaker 1>He wrote his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was his phd thesis,</v>

70
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.460
<v Speaker 1>although it might've been his master's </v>
<v Speaker 1>thesis on the Marxist doctrine that the,</v>

71
00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.223
<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>urban people were parasites on rural </v>

72
00:05:03.551 --> 00:05:04.950
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

73
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:05.793
<v Speaker 1>there's a theory that says that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>genuine value this is generated purely </v>

74
00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:10.654
<v Speaker 1>by labor and much of that rural labor </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the city's siphon off the excess </v>

75
00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:17.520
<v Speaker 1>productive power and are able to Paris </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ties,</v>

76
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.660
<v Speaker 1>the countryside as a consequence of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and which is an,</v>

77
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendously</v>

78
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:30.400
<v Speaker 1>nonproductive theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Pol Pot put it into practice.</v>

79
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.233
<v Speaker 1>And so when he went back into Cambodia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he chased everybody out of the cities </v>

80
00:05:33.911 --> 00:05:37.120
<v Speaker 1>and killed about 6 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

81
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can read about that if you want.</v>

82
00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:43.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a pretty appalling section of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of 20th century history,</v>

83
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.863
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when it's the case that he </v>

84
00:05:45.251 --> 00:05:46.084
<v Speaker 1>was in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was educated in the west and had </v>

85
00:05:48.971 --> 00:05:53.710
<v Speaker 1>these presuppositions drummed into them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's fruit,</v>

86
00:05:53.711 --> 00:05:54.544
<v Speaker 1>Cole Cole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I have no respect for it by the way </v>

87
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:00.463
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've read a fair bit of foot </v>

88
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:03.224
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think everything he says is </v>

89
00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:06.200
<v Speaker 1>obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

90
00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:09.590
<v Speaker 1>he criticizes the idea of mental illness</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

91
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.050
<v Speaker 1>as a social construct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

92
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

93
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.193
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not like psychiatrists and </v>

94
00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:18.944
<v Speaker 1>psychologists and mental health </v>
<v Speaker 1>professionals who are relatively well </v>

95
00:06:21.191 --> 00:06:22.024
<v Speaker 1>informed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't known about that since for the </v>

96
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:24.524
<v Speaker 1>last 60 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it might be a revelation to </v>

97
00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:32.921
<v Speaker 1>people who who don't notice that psyche </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatry for example,</v>

98
00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:34.364
<v Speaker 1>is something like a compromise between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the patient biology and the social </v>

99
00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:39.014
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

100
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:40.003
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychiatric ailments often have a </v>

101
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:43.874
<v Speaker 1>biological tilt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way they manifest themselves in </v>

102
00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:51.731
<v Speaker 1>society is clearly conditioned in very </v>
<v Speaker 1>intense ways by the particular</v>

103
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:54.763
<v Speaker 1>conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obtaining at the point that the person </v>

104
00:06:56.721 --> 00:06:57.554
<v Speaker 1>who has that biological predisposition </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists even whether or not that's </v>

105
00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:01.454
<v Speaker 1>pathological can be tilted one way or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another by the by cultural norms and </v>

106
00:07:05.901 --> 00:07:09.170
<v Speaker 1>then of course when you're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues like insurance,</v>

107
00:07:09.171 --> 00:07:11.570
<v Speaker 1>payment and treatment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hospitalization,</v>

108
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:12.583
<v Speaker 1>obviously you're pulling in all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems that are by no means purely </v>

109
00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:17.264
<v Speaker 1>scientific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't find it particularly useful </v>

110
00:07:20.751 --> 00:07:23.510
<v Speaker 1>critique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's obvious as far as I'm concerned,</v>

111
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.030
<v Speaker 1>and the other thing that code did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think this is the typical,</v>

112
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.680
<v Speaker 1>especially the French intellectuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>typical sleight of hand.</v>

113
00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:35.570
<v Speaker 1>Once Marxism became,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:36.523
<v Speaker 1>once you were no longer able to call </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself a committed Marxist because </v>

115
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:44.780
<v Speaker 1>committed Marxism had led to </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable brutality,</v>

116
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a scale that had never probably,</v>

117
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:51.860
<v Speaker 1>I think never been experienced in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire history of the planet,</v>

118
00:07:51.861 --> 00:07:55.010
<v Speaker 1>at least in terms of its reach and </v>
<v Speaker 1>duration.</v>

119
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:57.920
<v Speaker 1>You didn't get to call yourself a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marxist anymore,</v>

120
00:07:57.921 --> 00:08:00.410
<v Speaker 1>although there were still people and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>still see them saying,</v>

121
00:08:00.411 --> 00:08:02.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't real Marxism.</v>

122
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:06.710
<v Speaker 1>Which I think is a combo of staggering </v>
<v Speaker 1>proportions.</v>

123
00:08:06.711 --> 00:08:08.090
<v Speaker 1>That usually means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

124
00:08:08.091 --> 00:08:10.850
<v Speaker 1>if I was the person running the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wouldn't have happened.</v>

125
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the logic behind it.</v>

126
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.130
<v Speaker 1>They didn't put the principles into </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice properly.</v>

127
00:08:16.131 --> 00:08:16.611
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

128
00:08:16.611 --> 00:08:17.444
<v Speaker 1>well lots of people put the damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>principles into practice and the same </v>

129
00:08:19.521 --> 00:08:20.354
<v Speaker 1>thing happened everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at some point you have to kind of </v>

130
00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:24.980
<v Speaker 1>wonder if there's something wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the principals.</v>

131
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:26.293
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I did was take the Marxist </v>

132
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.823
<v Speaker 1>presupposition that everything was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be boiled down to economics and </v>

133
00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:35.803
<v Speaker 1>economic power and translated it into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that everything just boiled </v>

134
00:08:38.901 --> 00:08:40.820
<v Speaker 1>down to power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

135
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.673
<v Speaker 1>and the reason that we have institutions</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to include and to exclude and that </v>

136
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:50.060
<v Speaker 1>the institutions always run for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit of those at the top.</v>

137
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:50.893
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

138
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.030
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a little bit true,</v>

139
00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.380
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

140
00:08:54.381 --> 00:08:55.214
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a scientist would look at that and </v>

141
00:08:56.731 --> 00:08:57.181
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

142
00:08:57.181 --> 00:08:58.270
<v Speaker 1>well probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

143
00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.513
<v Speaker 1>power dynamics in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a functioning economic and political </v>

144
00:09:02.941 --> 00:09:03.774
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe account for 10 percent of the </v>

145
00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:06.180
<v Speaker 1>variance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

146
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.190
<v Speaker 1>maybe 15 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

147
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.930
<v Speaker 1>if you have a say you want to go to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ivy league school,</v>

148
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.780
<v Speaker 1>while if your parents went to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>

149
00:09:15.781 --> 00:09:16.614
<v Speaker 1>you're more likely to get in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not that much more likely to </v>

150
00:09:18.961 --> 00:09:21.210
<v Speaker 1>get in and you still have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

151
00:09:21.211 --> 00:09:22.044
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that if you have a </v>

152
00:09:24.211 --> 00:09:26.310
<v Speaker 1>pretty decent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

153
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:31.340
<v Speaker 1>high school gpa and you do very well on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sats and you have some other talents</v>

154
00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:33.480
<v Speaker 1>of some sort because that's also </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary,</v>

155
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.680
<v Speaker 1>then they might pick you over someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else who's roughly will you qualify it.</v>

156
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.530
<v Speaker 1>If you have a familial history of </v>
<v Speaker 1>attendance at school.</v>

157
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.680
<v Speaker 1>So obviously you get an exact end an </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage,</v>

158
00:09:43.681 --> 00:09:44.514
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the kind of advantage that </v>

159
00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:52.290
<v Speaker 1>accounts for the entirety of how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system is structured.</v>

160
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.480
<v Speaker 1>It's an advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you can say,</v>

161
00:09:54.481 --> 00:09:55.710
<v Speaker 1>well that's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

162
00:09:55.711 --> 00:09:56.544
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

163
00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:58.103
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most systems are certainly not 100 </v>

164
00:10:01.531 --> 00:10:05.670
<v Speaker 1>percent either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fair or just definitely not,</v>

165
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:11.310
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of comparing them to utopia,</v>

166
00:10:11.311 --> 00:10:13.380
<v Speaker 1>you might compare them to another </v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

167
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:15.690
<v Speaker 1>which is the only reasonable way to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

168
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like everything looks terrible when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you compare it to the best thing you can</v>

169
00:10:19.231 --> 00:10:20.064
<v Speaker 1>possibly imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the best thing you can possibly </v>

170
00:10:22.351 --> 00:10:23.184
<v Speaker 1>imagine is it's an empty fiction because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so devoid of detailed content that </v>

171
00:10:28.801 --> 00:10:31.680
<v Speaker 1>you can't use it as a guide to reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

172
00:10:31.681 --> 00:10:32.514
<v Speaker 1>I mean the idea that things could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>better has its roots in some sense in a </v>

173
00:10:37.861 --> 00:10:41.760
<v Speaker 1>broad scale Utopian project and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that things could be better,</v>

174
00:10:41.761 --> 00:10:45.900
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing an analysis of a complex system,</v>

175
00:10:45.901 --> 00:10:49.960
<v Speaker 1>you get to compare it to an ideological </v>
<v Speaker 1>utopia and then describe all the reasons</v>

176
00:10:49.961 --> 00:10:50.880
<v Speaker 1>that it's bad.</v>

177
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:52.703
<v Speaker 1>It's not</v>

178
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.280
<v Speaker 1>appropriate to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too simplistic.</v>

179
00:10:57.281 --> 00:10:58.114
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to do anything to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually address the problems that the </v>

180
00:11:00.821 --> 00:11:04.660
<v Speaker 1>system has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you take that approach.</v>

181
00:11:04.661 --> 00:11:05.494
<v Speaker 1>And then of course like pure utopian </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking is extraordinarily dangerous </v>

182
00:11:09.791 --> 00:11:14.791
<v Speaker 1>because if you think that your way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>molding society into some ultimate state</v>

183
00:11:17.861 --> 00:11:22.060
<v Speaker 1>of perfection is headed towards some </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate state of perfection,</v>

184
00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.253
<v Speaker 1>then you can justify absolutely anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do right now on the basis of the </v>

185
00:11:27.071 --> 00:11:30.010
<v Speaker 1>fact that things are going to improve so</v>
<v Speaker 1>radically in the future.</v>

186
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.680
<v Speaker 1>And that means any of your behaviors are</v>
<v Speaker 1>excused.</v>

187
00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:35.200
<v Speaker 1>The end is worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

188
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:41.130
<v Speaker 1>if someone says that you have to kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonder what there are actually planning.</v>

189
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

190
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.960
<v Speaker 1>what they're actually planning to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

191
00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:51.491
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

192
00:11:51.491 --> 00:11:52.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the issue?</v>

193
00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:53.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the is that it's</v>

194
00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.610
<v Speaker 1>so the same critic with regards to Food </v>
<v Speaker 1>Co.</v>

195
00:11:58.611 --> 00:12:00.610
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what's basically the same thing</v>

196
00:12:00.611 --> 00:12:05.611
<v Speaker 1>that food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coal criticized a variety of low,</v>

197
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>profound institutions,</v>

198
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.633
<v Speaker 1>sexual institutions say like marriage </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then institutions of power like </v>

199
00:12:13.451 --> 00:12:16.150
<v Speaker 1>prisons and institutions of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

200
00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:17.470
<v Speaker 1>mental health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

201
00:12:17.471 --> 00:12:22.120
<v Speaker 1>the whole institutional framework.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He criticized them on the basis of power</v>

202
00:12:22.121 --> 00:12:26.470
<v Speaker 1>and exclusion and you could do that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some truth in it,</v>

203
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.300
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>

204
00:12:28.301 --> 00:12:29.134
<v Speaker 1>coal also made the presupposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that presupposition is </v>

205
00:12:32.111 --> 00:12:32.944
<v Speaker 1>that everything is about something else </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it's almost impossible to see </v>

206
00:12:36.821 --> 00:12:37.654
<v Speaker 1>how it can be applied to fukiko himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'd have to ask if you were a </v>

207
00:12:41.531 --> 00:12:42.364
<v Speaker 1>student of flute coal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what power aims drove his attempt to </v>

208
00:12:47.081 --> 00:12:47.914
<v Speaker 1>analyze everything in terms of power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I actually think with code it's </v>

209
00:12:51.401 --> 00:12:52.330
<v Speaker 1>pretty obvious.</v>

210
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:53.523
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a game that never goes </v>

211
00:12:55.451 --> 00:12:57.790
<v Speaker 1>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

212
00:12:57.791 --> 00:12:58.624
<v Speaker 1>So I thought about that a lot is like is</v>
<v Speaker 1>there any system that you can develop </v>

213
00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:03.843
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't have the negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of systems in general and </v>

214
00:13:07.211 --> 00:13:11.230
<v Speaker 1>then if that is possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how and why might it be possible?</v>

215
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.680
<v Speaker 1>And this is partly why I'm talking to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you about this particular diagram again,</v>

216
00:13:17.961 --> 00:13:18.794
<v Speaker 1>and I think the reason now I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and you guys can think it through </v>

217
00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.080
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

218
00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.820
<v Speaker 1>lots of people have talked to me about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the content of this course and you know,</v>

219
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:27.693
<v Speaker 1>they've said that it's been very helpful</v>
<v Speaker 1>for them when it comes to interpreting </v>

220
00:13:31.121 --> 00:13:34.000
<v Speaker 1>certain elements of their life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

221
00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.310
<v Speaker 1>but some people have said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

222
00:13:36.311 --> 00:13:41.311
<v Speaker 1>it's just another system and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that.</v>

223
00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:42.543
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a medical system and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think the rules that apply to </v>

224
00:13:44.951 --> 00:13:48.690
<v Speaker 1>systems also apply to medical systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

225
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:50.980
<v Speaker 1>that could just be me.</v>

226
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.113
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to decide that for </v>

227
00:13:53.411 --> 00:13:54.244
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think the reason that I can make </v>

228
00:13:56.291 --> 00:14:00.550
<v Speaker 1>that claim and that it's a valid claim </v>
<v Speaker 1>is because first of all,</v>

229
00:14:00.551 --> 00:14:02.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe it's an intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

230
00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:04.203
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's an attempt to reduce </v>
<v Speaker 1>a complex set of phenomena to something </v>

231
00:14:07.811 --> 00:14:08.644
<v Speaker 1>that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what dispenses with important elements </v>

232
00:14:14.381 --> 00:14:17.170
<v Speaker 1>of their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their existence.</v>

233
00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:18.813
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me give you an example of how that </v>

234
00:14:20.441 --> 00:14:21.274
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're looking at the world </v>

235
00:14:23.231 --> 00:14:24.064
<v Speaker 1>through a biased lands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it means is you take nonrandom </v>

236
00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:28.443
<v Speaker 1>samples of the environmental data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can give you a quick example of </v>

237
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:37.360
<v Speaker 1>something I saw that I thought was very </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular in that regard.</v>

238
00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've used this example </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

239
00:14:39.731 --> 00:14:40.564
<v Speaker 1>but about 10 years ago or there abouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>naomi klein made a documentary about </v>

240
00:14:45.221 --> 00:14:46.054
<v Speaker 1>this factory down in south America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was in Argentina and this </v>

241
00:14:49.811 --> 00:14:50.644
<v Speaker 1>was just after all the foreign capital </v>
<v Speaker 1>fled to Argentina and the economy </v>

242
00:14:55.041 --> 00:14:55.874
<v Speaker 1>collapsed completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something that happens to </v>

243
00:14:57.081 --> 00:14:58.970
<v Speaker 1>Argentina fairly regularly by the way.</v>

244
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.950
<v Speaker 1>And she went down there to this factory </v>
<v Speaker 1>where there were working man,</v>

245
00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:04.143
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they had been building heavy </v>

246
00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:07.630
<v Speaker 1>machinery and the working men decided </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were going to.</v>

247
00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:08.483
<v Speaker 1>This factory had been padlocked and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had been locked out because things had </v>

248
00:15:11.631 --> 00:15:12.464
<v Speaker 1>come to a halt and they decided that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were going to take the chains off </v>

249
00:15:15.711 --> 00:15:19.030
<v Speaker 1>the factory gate and go in there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>start making heavy machinery again.</v>

250
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:22.400
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very cool documentary as far as I</v>

251
00:15:22.401 --> 00:15:23.234
<v Speaker 1>was concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She went down there and she interviewed </v>

252
00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:25.124
<v Speaker 1>all these working guys and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they talked about how their lives have </v>

253
00:15:27.351 --> 00:15:31.340
<v Speaker 1>been brought to a halt by the factory </v>
<v Speaker 1>closure and and obviously it sucked that</v>

254
00:15:31.341 --> 00:15:32.174
<v Speaker 1>they were sitting around doing nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not being paid for anything when </v>

255
00:15:34.491 --> 00:15:37.880
<v Speaker 1>they could have been inside the factory </v>
<v Speaker 1>building heavy machinery,</v>

256
00:15:37.881 --> 00:15:39.260
<v Speaker 1>which is what they wanted to do.</v>

257
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.513
<v Speaker 1>So she went down there and laid out </v>
<v Speaker 1>their story and it was very sympathetic </v>

258
00:15:44.181 --> 00:15:46.010
<v Speaker 1>to the workers and good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

259
00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.150
<v Speaker 1>fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

260
00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:51.410
<v Speaker 1>But then she went and interviewed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy who owned the factory and she didn't</v>

261
00:15:51.411 --> 00:15:53.210
<v Speaker 1>ask him any real questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

262
00:15:53.211 --> 00:15:56.660
<v Speaker 1>because what she had she did instead was</v>
<v Speaker 1>caricaturizing him.</v>

263
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:59.570
<v Speaker 1>even a priority is sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

264
00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.150
<v Speaker 1>a fascist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a capitalist,</v>

265
00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:06.320
<v Speaker 1>sort of like the millionaire in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>monopoly and,</v>

266
00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:11.860
<v Speaker 1>and never tried to get beneath the </v>
<v Speaker 1>superficial a priority categorization to</v>

267
00:16:14.961 --> 00:16:16.970
<v Speaker 1>find out what the hell he actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>

268
00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:18.800
<v Speaker 1>And I was just waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

269
00:16:18.801 --> 00:16:19.940
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this is cool.</v>

270
00:16:19.941 --> 00:16:21.950
<v Speaker 1>What the hell does the factory owner </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to say?</v>

271
00:16:21.951 --> 00:16:23.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where does money go?</v>

272
00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.910
<v Speaker 1>why does he think he has a right to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>factory?</v>

273
00:16:25.911 --> 00:16:27.560
<v Speaker 1>Like what are his conditions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ownership?</v>

274
00:16:27.561 --> 00:16:29.990
<v Speaker 1>Did he earn the money with video </v>
<v Speaker 1>inherited?</v>

275
00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.153
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does he think about the fact that </v>

276
00:16:32.151 --> 00:16:35.120
<v Speaker 1>Argentina is gone to me is collapsed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does he.</v>

277
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.730
<v Speaker 1>How does he feel about the fact that all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these workers are out of work?</v>

278
00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.700
<v Speaker 1>What does he think about the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they opened up the factory again,</v>

279
00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.820
<v Speaker 1>like there's a lot of interesting things</v>
<v Speaker 1>to ask this guy.</v>

280
00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.980
<v Speaker 1>None of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of it had.</v>

281
00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:51.520
<v Speaker 1>And so to me what happened was that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like someone with neglect,</v>

282
00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:53.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where she was looking at the world,</v>

283
00:16:53.451 --> 00:16:54.284
<v Speaker 1>but you could only see half of </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and the half she saw was </v>

284
00:16:56.511 --> 00:16:57.344
<v Speaker 1>probably perfectly no justifiable had </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's had its proper domain of </v>

285
00:17:03.921 --> 00:17:06.830
<v Speaker 1>application,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the half she missed.</v>

286
00:17:06.831 --> 00:17:09.170
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what about that part of the story?</v>

287
00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.213
<v Speaker 1>You're going to reduce that to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to reduce that too cliche </v>

288
00:17:12.651 --> 00:17:15.350
<v Speaker 1>and stereotype and expand up the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story.</v>

289
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:16.723
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only reason you do that is if you </v>

290
00:17:17.931 --> 00:17:20.000
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to find out what the hell </v>
<v Speaker 1>was going on.</v>

291
00:17:20.001 --> 00:17:23.600
<v Speaker 1>If you all wanted to do is gather </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence that would support your initial</v>

292
00:17:23.601 --> 00:17:24.434
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>

293
00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:26.863
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know perfectly well that there's </v>

294
00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.840
<v Speaker 1>plenty of situations where workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conditions of workers are absolutely</v>

295
00:17:32.841 --> 00:17:33.674
<v Speaker 1>abysmal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

296
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.233
<v Speaker 1>one of the books I've read this I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>are remarkable documentation of that </v>

297
00:17:38.241 --> 00:17:41.720
<v Speaker 1>fact is a book by george orwell called </v>
<v Speaker 1>road to wigan pier,</v>

298
00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:46.440
<v Speaker 1>which is a study of the conditions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>coal miners lived in in 19 thirties in,</v>

299
00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.510
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in britain,</v>

300
00:17:47.511 --> 00:17:49.270
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bloody dismal.</v>

301
00:17:49.271 --> 00:17:51.540
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that they were exploited,</v>

302
00:17:51.541 --> 00:17:54.030
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a tougher one because</v>

303
00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:01.680
<v Speaker 1>the industrial revolution was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard on people and it was really,</v>

304
00:18:01.681 --> 00:18:03.890
<v Speaker 1>really hard on some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

305
00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:08.930
<v Speaker 1>particularly on some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether that was because of exploitation</v>

306
00:18:09.061 --> 00:18:09.894
<v Speaker 1>or because of the existence of absolute </v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty is not all that obvious and you </v>

307
00:18:14.941 --> 00:18:16.860
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a complicated.</v>

308
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:17.723
<v Speaker 1>It's a complicated issue now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of times when workers were </v>

309
00:18:21.001 --> 00:18:21.834
<v Speaker 1>clearly exploited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there were times as well </v>

310
00:18:24.631 --> 00:18:27.560
<v Speaker 1>when they work anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great book and you know,</v>

311
00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:28.453
<v Speaker 1>he does a lovely job of laying out a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationale for why the workers should be </v>

312
00:18:32.521 --> 00:18:36.210
<v Speaker 1>treated far better than they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>treated and so fine.</v>

313
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.110
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wonderful.</v>

314
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:40.103
<v Speaker 1>There's something to be said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is when you want to say </v>

315
00:18:43.771 --> 00:18:44.604
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to take an unbiased sample if </v>

316
00:18:46.261 --> 00:18:47.094
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this is why I like this </v>

317
00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:52.410
<v Speaker 1>particular motive conceptualization and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the reason I think it's not</v>

318
00:18:52.411 --> 00:18:53.244
<v Speaker 1>an intellectual construction is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it emerges naturally out of the </v>

319
00:18:57.541 --> 00:19:01.830
<v Speaker 1>structure of mythology and narrative and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think this through yourself,</v>

320
00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:02.693
<v Speaker 1>but as far as I've been able to tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>narratives that present themselves in </v>

321
00:19:07.441 --> 00:19:08.274
<v Speaker 1>terms of archetypal characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about a comprehensive </v>

322
00:19:11.131 --> 00:19:15.720
<v Speaker 1>narrative is it can't leave out an </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypal character or it failed.</v>

323
00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Now I can give you an example of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

324
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:22.560
<v Speaker 1>So how many of you have seen disney </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeping beauty?</v>

325
00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

326
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.350
<v Speaker 1>so many of you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many it.</v>

327
00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:28.051
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

328
00:19:28.051 --> 00:19:30.120
<v Speaker 1>so there's a few that happened while the</v>
<v Speaker 1>disney movies,</v>

329
00:19:30.121 --> 00:19:30.954
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of standard childhood </v>

330
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.650
<v Speaker 1>affairs now in sleeping beauty.</v>

331
00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:35.483
<v Speaker 1>What happens is that the king and queen </v>
<v Speaker 1>give birth to a princess after trying </v>

332
00:19:38.431 --> 00:19:41.570
<v Speaker 1>for a substantial amount of time and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

333
00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.413
<v Speaker 1>she arrives healthy and beautiful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they have a christening day and </v>

334
00:19:44.611 --> 00:19:49.260
<v Speaker 1>they invite everybody to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't invite maleficent who's a</v>

335
00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.810
<v Speaker 1>dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which roughly speaking,</v>

336
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:52.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like she's,</v>

337
00:19:52.651 --> 00:19:54.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's queen of the underworld that for,</v>

338
00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:58.230
<v Speaker 1>for lack of a better word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's the negative element of femininity</v>

339
00:19:59.100 --> 00:19:59.933
<v Speaker 1>and they don't invite her to the party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so she shows up anyways and says </v>

340
00:20:04.801 --> 00:20:07.160
<v Speaker 1>that because they didn't invite her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

341
00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:10.620
<v Speaker 1>their daughter's going to die when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she had 16,</v>

342
00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:11.483
<v Speaker 1>which is roughly the age of let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual maturation for a story of that </v>

343
00:20:15.271 --> 00:20:16.104
<v Speaker 1>sort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's another little positive </v>

344
00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:24.050
<v Speaker 1>magic female in the story who mitigates </v>
<v Speaker 1>that death sentence to protracted sleep.</v>

345
00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.560
<v Speaker 1>While the idea behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>

346
00:20:31.561 --> 00:20:33.690
<v Speaker 1>very interesting story.</v>

347
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:34.523
<v Speaker 1>It's an incredible story in a sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>because what it says is that if your </v>

348
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:42.810
<v Speaker 1>parents protect you too much from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dark side of life when you're young,</v>

349
00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:44.203
<v Speaker 1>that what will happen when you start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the road to maturity is you'll be so </v>

350
00:20:48.611 --> 00:20:49.444
<v Speaker 1>naive and so fragile that you'll want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be unconscious instead of paying </v>

351
00:20:53.801 --> 00:20:54.634
<v Speaker 1>attention and that you're going to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be rescued from that state by </v>

352
00:20:58.031 --> 00:20:58.864
<v Speaker 1>something and it could be a prince,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one which is how that story </v>

353
00:21:01.871 --> 00:21:02.704
<v Speaker 1>lays itself out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or it also could be that symbolically </v>

354
00:21:05.921 --> 00:21:06.754
<v Speaker 1>masculine and exploratory element of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own psyche and the stories are </v>

355
00:21:10.151 --> 00:21:10.984
<v Speaker 1>ambivalent about whether it's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>external event or an intern with and it </v>

356
00:21:13.931 --> 00:21:15.720
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

357
00:21:15.721 --> 00:21:16.250
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

358
00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:17.083
<v Speaker 1>the things ended up being the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's actually what happens in </v>

359
00:21:19.481 --> 00:21:21.160
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sleeping beauty story.</v>

360
00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end,</v>

361
00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:28.260
<v Speaker 1>prince who's also enslaved by this </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible negative feminine force manages</v>

362
00:21:29.681 --> 00:21:30.514
<v Speaker 1>to escape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the maleficent turns into a dragon </v>

363
00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.073
<v Speaker 1>and he has to fight her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he goes and rescues the </v>

364
00:21:36.551 --> 00:21:39.310
<v Speaker 1>princess and she wakes up and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kingdoms rejuvenated.</v>

365
00:21:39.311 --> 00:21:42.430
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a classic classic story,</v>

366
00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:43.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not.</v>

367
00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:48.490
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because tHe disney movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>frozen was put forward as a,</v>

368
00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:52.270
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a feminist alternative to the classic</v>

369
00:21:52.271 --> 00:21:54.430
<v Speaker 1>fairytales at first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that.</v>

370
00:21:54.431 --> 00:21:57.340
<v Speaker 1>You can't just generate up a fairytale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

371
00:21:57.341 --> 00:21:59.670
<v Speaker 1>there's recent evidence that some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these fairytales,</v>

372
00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:00.663
<v Speaker 1>the ones that the grimm brothers and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hans christian andersen collected </v>

373
00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:04.473
<v Speaker 1>are up to 10,000 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just come up with a counter </v>

374
00:22:08.081 --> 00:22:10.840
<v Speaker 1>fairy tale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just not how it works.</v>

375
00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:14.590
<v Speaker 1>And the way that fairytale is </v>
<v Speaker 1>structured,</v>

376
00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:19.620
<v Speaker 1>it has nothing to do with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the necessity for anyone to rely on</v>

377
00:22:20.171 --> 00:22:21.580
<v Speaker 1>anyone else for anything.</v>

378
00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:22.473
<v Speaker 1>It's a complex portrayal of the denied </v>
<v Speaker 1>dynamic relationship between archetypal </v>

379
00:22:27.551 --> 00:22:28.660
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

380
00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:29.523
<v Speaker 1>it's one form of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of different forms of the </v>

381
00:22:31.991 --> 00:22:32.824
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I liked about sleeping beauty </v>

382
00:22:35.231 --> 00:22:36.190
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and mrs,</v>

383
00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.940
<v Speaker 1>what's nice about the real fairytales is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that along with the positive,</v>

384
00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:42.190
<v Speaker 1>there is negative and it's real </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative.</v>

385
00:22:42.191 --> 00:22:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Like real fairy tales are terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't who is it?</v>

386
00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Is it in sleeping beauty or in snow </v>
<v Speaker 1>white?</v>

387
00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In one of the famous grimm fairy tales,</v>

388
00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:56.860
<v Speaker 1>one of the evil sisters ends up dancing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and red hot shoes until she dies.</v>

389
00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.113
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

390
00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:02.500
<v Speaker 1>they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very violent and and unsettling,</v>

391
00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:03.760
<v Speaker 1>and it's because they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

392
00:23:03.761 --> 00:23:05.620
<v Speaker 1>they have the quality of genuine folk </v>
<v Speaker 1>tales,</v>

393
00:23:05.621 --> 00:23:06.454
<v Speaker 1>but the reason for that is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're dealing with real things like </v>

394
00:23:08.861 --> 00:23:11.170
<v Speaker 1>the hansel and gretel is a good example </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>

395
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:11.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

396
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.513
<v Speaker 1>Kids are abandoned out in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They find something that's too good to </v>

397
00:23:15.041 --> 00:23:15.874
<v Speaker 1>be true inside this thing that's too </v>
<v Speaker 1>good to be true is something that wants </v>

398
00:23:19.001 --> 00:23:22.000
<v Speaker 1>to fatten them up and devour them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a rough story,</v>

399
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:25.930
<v Speaker 1>but what it's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stories,</v>

400
00:23:25.931 --> 00:23:26.764
<v Speaker 1>the stories have evolved to represent </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental dynamic elements of </v>

401
00:23:29.711 --> 00:23:33.060
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you conceptualize existence in,</v>

402
00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.470
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of character,</v>

403
00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:36.963
<v Speaker 1>and the thing is you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize existence in terms of </v>

404
00:23:39.461 --> 00:23:40.294
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a person because what you do </v>

405
00:23:42.671 --> 00:23:43.504
<v Speaker 1>and existence is act out your character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your character is an element of </v>

406
00:23:47.601 --> 00:23:50.300
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>

407
00:23:50.301 --> 00:23:51.134
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that society has a </v>

408
00:23:52.131 --> 00:23:52.964
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually it does mean that because </v>

409
00:23:55.401 --> 00:23:57.740
<v Speaker 1>partly what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're socialized,</v>

410
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:58.603
<v Speaker 1>say into a culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the culture exists in the same </v>

411
00:24:02.121 --> 00:24:05.600
<v Speaker 1>relationship to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking as another person does.</v>

412
00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:08.780
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you put money in the bank,</v>

413
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:11.960
<v Speaker 1>which is in principle a representation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your labor.</v>

414
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.980
<v Speaker 1>What you're doing is entering into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>contract with the broader social world,</v>

415
00:24:15.981 --> 00:24:16.814
<v Speaker 1>which is one of promise essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the future society promises to </v>

416
00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:23.773
<v Speaker 1>return your value at a future date.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a contractual relationship and </v>

417
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:29.683
<v Speaker 1>the reason that god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the father is a very common </v>

418
00:24:31.761 --> 00:24:36.761
<v Speaker 1>representation is because treating the </v>
<v Speaker 1>they in in heideggerian terms,</v>

419
00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:38.863
<v Speaker 1>the others in heideggerian terms as if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're an embodied entity actually </v>

420
00:24:43.791 --> 00:24:44.624
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's because it is an emergent </v>

421
00:24:48.561 --> 00:24:52.970
<v Speaker 1>property of all over the personalities </v>
<v Speaker 1>that make it up and so you're.</v>

422
00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:56.480
<v Speaker 1>You're interacting with that emergent </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality all the time.</v>

423
00:24:56.481 --> 00:24:57.950
<v Speaker 1>You could even say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

424
00:24:57.951 --> 00:24:58.784
<v Speaker 1>that that's the friday and ied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the thing that the representation </v>

425
00:25:03.261 --> 00:25:06.050
<v Speaker 1>of that inside you is what makes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel guilty.</v>

426
00:25:06.051 --> 00:25:10.880
<v Speaker 1>When you transgress against certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>moral rules and you might say along with</v>

427
00:25:10.881 --> 00:25:11.714
<v Speaker 1>the radical existentialists that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just arbitrary and that you can create </v>

428
00:25:15.171 --> 00:25:19.100
<v Speaker 1>your own values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not just arbitrary because it's</v>

429
00:25:19.101 --> 00:25:19.934
<v Speaker 1>dependent on the consent of others as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well as on some internal harmony or </v>

430
00:25:23.571 --> 00:25:24.170
<v Speaker 1>disharmony.</v>

431
00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:25.003
<v Speaker 1>It's not arbitrary and you can't just </v>
<v Speaker 1>set that up by yourself so you know </v>

432
00:25:31.071 --> 00:25:35.690
<v Speaker 1>these things or these things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>realities and their deep realities.</v>

433
00:25:35.691 --> 00:25:40.691
<v Speaker 1>Now this particular portrayal indicates </v>
<v Speaker 1>a kind of balance,</v>

434
00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:46.130
<v Speaker 1>so the the fundamental ground of reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>is neither positive nor negative.</v>

435
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:50.330
<v Speaker 1>It's the ground out of which everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive or negative emergence.</v>

436
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:51.183
<v Speaker 1>So you might think of the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground of reality as that which exists </v>

437
00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:59.660
<v Speaker 1>prior to your encounter with it and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have no idea what that is.</v>

438
00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Now you can think about it as you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it as</v>

439
00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:09.410
<v Speaker 1>people tend to think about what things </v>
<v Speaker 1>are made of anatomic terms,</v>

440
00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.273
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive way of thinking about it </v>

441
00:26:13.551 --> 00:26:14.384
<v Speaker 1>because what what exists beyond the </v>
<v Speaker 1>realm of your comprehension is the </v>

442
00:26:20.841 --> 00:26:21.674
<v Speaker 1>pattern relationship between everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything and you can't reduce it </v>

443
00:26:26.781 --> 00:26:27.614
<v Speaker 1>to any simple level of analysis because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you miss all sorts of elements of it </v>

444
00:26:31.461 --> 00:26:32.810
<v Speaker 1>that are extraordinarily important.</v>

445
00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:35.030
<v Speaker 1>If you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can't do that.</v>

446
00:26:35.031 --> 00:26:37.680
<v Speaker 1>That's not what experiences made out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

447
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:38.833
<v Speaker 1>or what the ground of experience is made</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it and so it's neutral in some sense </v>

448
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:46.710
<v Speaker 1>it because it exists beyond your </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter with it.</v>

449
00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.753
<v Speaker 1>It's the unknown as such,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason that that's often </v>

450
00:26:50.461 --> 00:26:51.294
<v Speaker 1>represented in the form of a predatory </v>
<v Speaker 1>lizard that has something to offer is </v>

451
00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:56.693
<v Speaker 1>precisely because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the absolute unknown has the </v>

452
00:26:59.941 --> 00:27:02.700
<v Speaker 1>capacity to tear you into pieces and </v>
<v Speaker 1>burn you up,</v>

453
00:27:02.701 --> 00:27:03.534
<v Speaker 1>but it also has the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rewarding you with everything you could </v>

454
00:27:07.261 --> 00:27:08.094
<v Speaker 1>possibly be rewarded with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's this strange juxtaposition of </v>

455
00:27:11.761 --> 00:27:14.220
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to think about it as potential,</v>

456
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:15.543
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people can get a grip on what </v>

457
00:27:16.741 --> 00:27:20.310
<v Speaker 1>potential means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's potential everywhere,</v>

458
00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:22.950
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have full potential.</v>

459
00:27:22.951 --> 00:27:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Your parents tell you that all the time.</v>

460
00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:25.890
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

461
00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.760
<v Speaker 1>it's the unrealized stuff of your being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

462
00:27:29.761 --> 00:27:34.440
<v Speaker 1>It's a very strange concept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential because you can't characterize</v>

463
00:27:34.441 --> 00:27:35.274
<v Speaker 1>it any way that you would characterize </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's real because it's not </v>

464
00:27:39.721 --> 00:27:40.950
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's potential,</v>

465
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:42.960
<v Speaker 1>but you act like it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

466
00:27:42.961 --> 00:27:45.450
<v Speaker 1>you'll feel guilty that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>living up to your potential.</v>

467
00:27:45.451 --> 00:27:46.284
<v Speaker 1>You're not manifesting your potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want people to interact with you so </v>

468
00:27:49.891 --> 00:27:52.410
<v Speaker 1>that they allow you to demonstrate your </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>

469
00:27:52.411 --> 00:27:56.610
<v Speaker 1>Like you act as if it's a reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Continually.</v>

470
00:27:56.611 --> 00:27:59.220
<v Speaker 1>You Think as if it's a reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Continually.</v>

471
00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.060
<v Speaker 1>You ask if your relationship has </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential,</v>

472
00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:03.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

473
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strange substance.</v>

474
00:28:06.541 --> 00:28:09.180
<v Speaker 1>Whatever this potential is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

475
00:28:09.181 --> 00:28:11.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unrealized possibility essentially,</v>

476
00:28:11.971 --> 00:28:12.804
<v Speaker 1>but you regard it as something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fluid and something that can develop in </v>

477
00:28:17.911 --> 00:28:18.744
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of different directions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>something whose development you can </v>

478
00:28:22.231 --> 00:28:24.960
<v Speaker 1>shape because otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you feel guilty?</v>

479
00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:25.793
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

480
00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:27.083
<v Speaker 1>if you're doing the wrong thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're realizing some potential in the </v>

481
00:28:30.481 --> 00:28:33.270
<v Speaker 1>wrong way and then you feel bad about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

482
00:28:33.271 --> 00:28:35.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's,</v>

483
00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:36.393
<v Speaker 1>there's some sense of intrinsic morality</v>
<v Speaker 1>operating at the bottom of that and </v>

484
00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:42.660
<v Speaker 1>we've talked a lot about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of that's built in biologically.</v>

485
00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Some of it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

486
00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:48.090
<v Speaker 1>structured culturally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of it's a consequence of you trying</v>

487
00:28:48.091 --> 00:28:49.390
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

488
00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.053
<v Speaker 1>trying to organize your in this plethora</v>
<v Speaker 1>of semi beings that you are into some </v>

489
00:28:56.281 --> 00:28:58.020
<v Speaker 1>integrated manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a very,</v>

490
00:28:58.021 --> 00:29:01.470
<v Speaker 1>very complicated thing and it's not just</v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary.</v>

491
00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.020
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the background,</v>

492
00:29:04.021 --> 00:29:06.510
<v Speaker 1>the dragon of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive and negative.</v>

493
00:29:06.511 --> 00:29:07.344
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the thing out of which everything </v>

494
00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:10.043
<v Speaker 1>springs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the scandinavian world </v>

495
00:29:12.451 --> 00:29:16.620
<v Speaker 1>tree for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or world trees in general,</v>

496
00:29:16.621 --> 00:29:17.454
<v Speaker 1>you very frequently have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of a serpent that's </v>

497
00:29:19.711 --> 00:29:20.544
<v Speaker 1>associated with the reason that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential is regarded as serpentine is </v>

498
00:29:27.631 --> 00:29:29.160
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily complicated.</v>

499
00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:29.993
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's partly because say </v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes shed their own skin and so they </v>

500
00:29:34.471 --> 00:29:35.304
<v Speaker 1>can be reborn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are a symbol of transformation </v>

501
00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:38.753
<v Speaker 1>and then they are sneaky and subtle and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so they appear in places you wouldn't </v>

502
00:29:41.861 --> 00:29:44.800
<v Speaker 1>necessarily expect them to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there were a terrible,</v>

503
00:29:44.801 --> 00:29:48.520
<v Speaker 1>terrible threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in overcoming that threat,</v>

504
00:29:48.521 --> 00:29:51.670
<v Speaker 1>you also develop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So not only are they a threat,</v>

505
00:29:51.671 --> 00:29:54.400
<v Speaker 1>but they're the kind of threat that </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you become strong.</v>

506
00:29:54.401 --> 00:29:55.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you face it.</v>

507
00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:56.643
<v Speaker 1>So that's partly why the snake is such </v>
<v Speaker 1>an ambivalent figuring in most </v>

508
00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.460
<v Speaker 1>mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

509
00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:04.570
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's complicated,</v>

510
00:30:04.571 --> 00:30:09.571
<v Speaker 1>but we'll return to that later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then out of that you might say,</v>

511
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:14.700
<v Speaker 1>emerges the unknown as you encounter it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

512
00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:15.733
<v Speaker 1>there's potential itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the first layer of potential </v>

513
00:30:19.901 --> 00:30:22.480
<v Speaker 1>are the things that you encountered that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand.</v>

514
00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:25.210
<v Speaker 1>So I can give you an example of that.</v>

515
00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:27.400
<v Speaker 1>so let's say you're a three year old or </v>
<v Speaker 1>two year old,</v>

516
00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.510
<v Speaker 1>that'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's better.</v>

517
00:30:28.511 --> 00:30:32.650
<v Speaker 1>And you're in your kitchen and a mouse </v>
<v Speaker 1>rent across the room and so you track it</v>

518
00:30:32.651 --> 00:30:33.484
<v Speaker 1>because you know your eyes pick up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement and you track the thing and </v>

519
00:30:36.431 --> 00:30:38.890
<v Speaker 1>then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an unexpected occurrence.</v>

520
00:30:38.891 --> 00:30:40.960
<v Speaker 1>So you don't know what it signifies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

521
00:30:40.961 --> 00:30:41.794
<v Speaker 1>So that's the emergence of something </v>
<v Speaker 1>tangibly unknown into your conceptual </v>

522
00:30:46.031 --> 00:30:46.864
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's not like you lacked any </v>

523
00:30:49.631 --> 00:30:50.464
<v Speaker 1>knowledge of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can tell that it what it sizes and </v>

524
00:30:52.901 --> 00:30:55.480
<v Speaker 1>you can get some estimation of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>speed,</v>

525
00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:57.333
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that what you have to do </v>

526
00:30:58.961 --> 00:30:59.794
<v Speaker 1>when you think about whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>something is unknown is you have to </v>

527
00:31:02.291 --> 00:31:03.124
<v Speaker 1>think about it in relationship to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy of perception that I keep </v>

528
00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.470
<v Speaker 1>throwing at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

529
00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:10.950
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

530
00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:12.790
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if something emerges,</v>

531
00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:13.713
<v Speaker 1>if you encounter an entity and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>map it at every single level of your </v>

532
00:31:18.161 --> 00:31:21.520
<v Speaker 1>value hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's known,</v>

533
00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:25.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to interact with it at a micro level</v>

534
00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:30.660
<v Speaker 1>and you know what its implications are </v>
<v Speaker 1>for every other level of your conceptual</v>

535
00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:32.200
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

536
00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.033
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what its implications are for the </v>

537
00:31:33.791 --> 00:31:34.624
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know exactly how to deal with </v>

538
00:31:35.921 --> 00:31:37.840
<v Speaker 1>that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's mapping at every single level.</v>

539
00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.670
<v Speaker 1>There's other things that are only </v>
<v Speaker 1>mapped at one level and not others.</v>

540
00:31:41.671 --> 00:31:42.504
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like the model s we'll say For the </v>

541
00:31:44.591 --> 00:31:45.690
<v Speaker 1>child who's never seen him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

542
00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:46.563
<v Speaker 1>it's like it shares some commonalities </v>
<v Speaker 1>with objects that the child is familiar </v>

543
00:31:50.861 --> 00:31:51.694
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's sufficient novelty so that </v>

544
00:31:54.281 --> 00:31:55.114
<v Speaker 1>it's also contaminated with the unknown </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that makes the child basically </v>

545
00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:02.080
<v Speaker 1>alert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>semi startled and alert.</v>

546
00:32:02.081 --> 00:32:05.530
<v Speaker 1>Now the child will immediately refer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>an adult.</v>

547
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:07.143
<v Speaker 1>It's a technical term actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll look at the adults face because </v>

548
00:32:10.241 --> 00:32:11.074
<v Speaker 1>the adults face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll broadcast the motivational and </v>

549
00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:19.640
<v Speaker 1>affective significance of that event and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so child looks references and then reads</v>

550
00:32:21.311 --> 00:32:24.490
<v Speaker 1>off the face of course the speech and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bodily auctions.</v>

551
00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Exactly what that thing signifies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

552
00:32:27.201 --> 00:32:28.034
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then if the person that they're </v>

553
00:32:29.171 --> 00:32:31.510
<v Speaker 1>looking at jumps up on the table and </v>
<v Speaker 1>screams,</v>

554
00:32:31.511 --> 00:32:34.180
<v Speaker 1>then that's one set of meanings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is god,</v>

555
00:32:34.181 --> 00:32:35.320
<v Speaker 1>this thing is magical.</v>

556
00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.170
<v Speaker 1>It'S only this big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And look at what effect it has on,</v>

557
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:41.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my aunt for the sake of argument,</v>

558
00:32:41.751 --> 00:32:42.351
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

559
00:32:42.351 --> 00:32:45.740
<v Speaker 1>pretty confident preacher as far as I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can tell being two years old,</v>

560
00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:48.110
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if she just dismisses it,</v>

561
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:49.423
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her actions are going to determine the </v>

562
00:32:50.961 --> 00:32:51.794
<v Speaker 1>meaning of that phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's how the transformation of the </v>

563
00:32:57.051 --> 00:33:01.370
<v Speaker 1>semi known thing into the more known </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing occurs,</v>

564
00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:04.580
<v Speaker 1>occurs almost always in a social </v>
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>

565
00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:05.593
<v Speaker 1>You can explore things by yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you rarely actually do that by </v>

566
00:33:08.421 --> 00:33:09.254
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost always you plugged into a </v>

567
00:33:11.541 --> 00:33:13.940
<v Speaker 1>social apparatus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

568
00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:16.340
<v Speaker 1>so you might be doing the specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigating,</v>

569
00:33:16.341 --> 00:33:17.174
<v Speaker 1>but the social apparatus is around you </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you can confer with it and it </v>

570
00:33:21.711 --> 00:33:26.030
<v Speaker 1>also shapes the way that you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with that specific thing.</v>

571
00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:27.853
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

572
00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.233
<v Speaker 1>now the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's generally not the unknown that </v>

573
00:33:34.071 --> 00:33:36.560
<v Speaker 1>you encountered that generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized</v>

574
00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:42.770
<v Speaker 1>using feminine symbolism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason for that.</v>

575
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:45.260
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've talked about many of them.</v>

576
00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:47.443
<v Speaker 1>One reason is because females do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual selection in human beings and so </v>

577
00:33:50.781 --> 00:33:53.320
<v Speaker 1>they act as the face of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another reason is,</v>

578
00:33:53.321 --> 00:33:54.154
<v Speaker 1>is that you can think of new possibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>always emerging out of the non cultural </v>

579
00:33:59.721 --> 00:34:01.430
<v Speaker 1>background in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

580
00:34:01.431 --> 00:34:02.264
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say that we send an expedition to </v>

581
00:34:06.051 --> 00:34:09.230
<v Speaker 1>mars and we're gathering new </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

582
00:34:09.231 --> 00:34:10.064
<v Speaker 1>As a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason we're gathering new </v>

583
00:34:11.121 --> 00:34:11.954
<v Speaker 1>information is because we've gotten out </v>
<v Speaker 1>past the domain of our knowledge in a </v>

584
00:34:15.441 --> 00:34:19.520
<v Speaker 1>sense and we're interacting with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something new and then that interaction,</v>

585
00:34:19.521 --> 00:34:24.200
<v Speaker 1>new information is generated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can say that it's partly the act</v>

586
00:34:24.201 --> 00:34:25.034
<v Speaker 1>of the perceiver that's generating the </v>
<v Speaker 1>new information and you can say that </v>

587
00:34:28.731 --> 00:34:32.540
<v Speaker 1>it's partly the act of the culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we send robots to mars,</v>

588
00:34:32.541 --> 00:34:33.950
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very,</v>

589
00:34:33.951 --> 00:34:37.010
<v Speaker 1>very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the culture goes there,</v>

590
00:34:37.011 --> 00:34:40.400
<v Speaker 1>but the individuals are observing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the individuals are buttressed by the</v>

591
00:34:40.401 --> 00:34:41.234
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are generating information </v>

592
00:34:42.621 --> 00:34:46.130
<v Speaker 1>because there's somewhere truly new and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so the information,</v>

593
00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:47.323
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unknown is a constant source of new </v>

594
00:34:49.041 --> 00:34:49.874
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a place that gives birth to new </v>

595
00:34:51.891 --> 00:34:52.724
<v Speaker 1>information and so that's another part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the reason that it seems to be </v>

596
00:34:55.611 --> 00:34:57.230
<v Speaker 1>symbolized in feminine form.</v>

597
00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:00.623
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just taking this in some senses and </v>

598
00:35:01.781 --> 00:35:02.614
<v Speaker 1>empirical fact I've looked at it looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's how these stories work and </v>

599
00:35:07.811 --> 00:35:11.230
<v Speaker 1>so I'd be trying to puzzle out why </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly that would be the case.</v>

600
00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.273
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think it's the case that we tend </v>

601
00:35:14.351 --> 00:35:17.770
<v Speaker 1>to look at the world from a social </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive perspective,</v>

602
00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:20.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We filter it through a social,</v>

603
00:35:20.081 --> 00:35:22.990
<v Speaker 1>cognitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological apparatus,</v>

604
00:35:22.991 --> 00:35:27.370
<v Speaker 1>and so we're very likely to see things </v>
<v Speaker 1>in character for him and characters have</v>

605
00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:28.623
<v Speaker 1>sexes and so that's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then which the attributes of </v>

606
00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:37.090
<v Speaker 1>femininity are the attributes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculinity that get used.</v>

607
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:41.730
<v Speaker 1>Symbolic reference in some sense there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an arbitrary ness about it.</v>

608
00:35:41.731 --> 00:35:44.070
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the egyptians,</v>

609
00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually you have a sky god,</v>

610
00:35:46.501 --> 00:35:47.334
<v Speaker 1>but they had a sky goddess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now she generally represent the night </v>

611
00:35:49.651 --> 00:35:50.484
<v Speaker 1>sky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not exactly the same thing as </v>

612
00:35:51.631 --> 00:35:53.370
<v Speaker 1>the day sky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

613
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:55.200
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to.</v>

614
00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:56.303
<v Speaker 1>It's so tricky because you have to look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the relationships between the </v>

615
00:35:58.621 --> 00:36:01.140
<v Speaker 1>characters in order to decide what all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the mean.</v>

616
00:36:01.141 --> 00:36:03.630
<v Speaker 1>And that shifts a little bit from story </v>
<v Speaker 1>to story.</v>

617
00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:06.570
<v Speaker 1>So this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

618
00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:09.960
<v Speaker 1>It's an approximation of the underlying </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

619
00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:11.490
<v Speaker 1>but there's a fair bit of variance in </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

620
00:36:11.491 --> 00:36:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Just like there's variation in stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

621
00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:16.853
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feminine element has a destructive </v>

622
00:36:18.211 --> 00:36:23.211
<v Speaker 1>element and a creative ass aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can see that people characterize</v>

623
00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:28.140
<v Speaker 1>their environments in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

624
00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:32.880
<v Speaker 1>you can map on environmental beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 1>onto this structure.</v>

625
00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:37.740
<v Speaker 1>You can say that the environmentalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor trays,</v>

626
00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:38.603
<v Speaker 1>nature as positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>portrays culture as negative and </v>

627
00:36:42.181 --> 00:36:43.014
<v Speaker 1>portrays the individual is negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the basic story is rampaging </v>

628
00:36:47.551 --> 00:36:48.384
<v Speaker 1>individual as member of a rapacious </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture invading the pristine landscape </v>

629
00:36:54.151 --> 00:36:56.610
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of beautiful mother nature.</v>

630
00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:58.980
<v Speaker 1>Now the thing about that story is it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

631
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:03.930
<v Speaker 1>The problem with this story is it's hAlf</v>
<v Speaker 1>true now.</v>

632
00:37:03.931 --> 00:37:04.764
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing that's interesting to </v>

633
00:37:06.481 --> 00:37:10.860
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize is that that's exactly the</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite of the frontier myth.</v>

634
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:12.263
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the frontier myth was a story that was </v>

635
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:18.000
<v Speaker 1>used extensIvely in europe to drive </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration into the United States,</v>

636
00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:20.190
<v Speaker 1>and it was used to some degree in Canada</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

637
00:37:20.191 --> 00:37:24.600
<v Speaker 1>In this story was the exact opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the hero.</v>

638
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:25.823
<v Speaker 1>So that would be the immigrant pioneer </v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing the benefits of order to a </v>

639
00:37:29.281 --> 00:37:31.440
<v Speaker 1>savage wilderness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

640
00:37:31.441 --> 00:37:32.274
<v Speaker 1>that's also true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so interesting that both of </v>

641
00:37:35.131 --> 00:37:39.360
<v Speaker 1>those things can be true and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely different from one another.</v>

642
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:40.703
<v Speaker 1>There's no commonality at all between </v>
<v Speaker 1>those two stories except for the way </v>

643
00:37:44.551 --> 00:37:45.384
<v Speaker 1>that they use the characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a feminine character of a </v>

644
00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:50.430
<v Speaker 1>masculine character that represents </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

645
00:37:50.431 --> 00:37:51.264
<v Speaker 1>and then there's another character that </v>
<v Speaker 1>represents the individual and you could </v>

646
00:37:54.001 --> 00:37:57.390
<v Speaker 1>even see that if you think about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>historically,</v>

647
00:37:57.391 --> 00:37:58.224
<v Speaker 1>the us was founded in some sense on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>frontier myth and you know that was too </v>

648
00:38:02.041 --> 00:38:02.874
<v Speaker 1>one sided,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so by the time the 19 sixties came </v>

649
00:38:04.681 --> 00:38:05.514
<v Speaker 1>along the early 19 sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's shifted to its opposite and that </v>

650
00:38:08.971 --> 00:38:09.804
<v Speaker 1>you need that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like systems have to oscillate to </v>

651
00:38:14.401 --> 00:38:16.590
<v Speaker 1>some degree to remain stable across </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

652
00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:17.423
<v Speaker 1>They can't just be fixed in place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're going to play back and forth </v>

653
00:38:19.981 --> 00:38:20.814
<v Speaker 1>through the archetypes in an attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep them balanced because that's what </v>

654
00:38:24.451 --> 00:38:25.284
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to keep them balanced and </v>

655
00:38:28.621 --> 00:38:32.280
<v Speaker 1>so while you have the destructive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative element of mother nature,</v>

656
00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:35.590
<v Speaker 1>you see that all the time in movies </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the,</v>

657
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.173
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that the hero is striving as </v>

658
00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:42.760
<v Speaker 1>against is the negative element of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>

659
00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:44.980
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have Seen the movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>alien?</v>

660
00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:47.120
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

661
00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.390
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty graphic representation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

662
00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:50.463
<v Speaker 1>well those aliens are more reptilian </v>
<v Speaker 1>informed so they're almost like there </v>

663
00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.990
<v Speaker 1>are more at the dragon of chaos level </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

664
00:38:58.050 --> 00:38:58.883
<v Speaker 1>of civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're like a terrible external </v>

665
00:39:02.321 --> 00:39:05.110
<v Speaker 1>force that's threatening human culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the individual.</v>

666
00:39:05.111 --> 00:39:05.944
<v Speaker 1>It's the exactly the opposite story </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's played out in what was the movie </v>

667
00:39:10.061 --> 00:39:11.800
<v Speaker 1>with all the blue creatures.</v>

668
00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:14.703
<v Speaker 1>Avatar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Avatar is exactly the opposite of that </v>

669
00:39:17.261 --> 00:39:18.230
<v Speaker 1>where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

670
00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:19.263
<v Speaker 1>the unknown nature is just nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like sweetness and bliss and you </v>

671
00:39:23.561 --> 00:39:24.394
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

672
00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:25.593
<v Speaker 1>and the human culture is portrayed as </v>
<v Speaker 1>spearheaded by greedy and rapacious </v>

673
00:39:29.921 --> 00:39:30.754
<v Speaker 1>individuals who are basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestations of the military </v>

674
00:39:32.861 --> 00:39:33.694
<v Speaker 1>industrial complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the funny thing is those both make </v>

675
00:39:36.071 --> 00:39:38.980
<v Speaker 1>good stories and that's because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

676
00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:40.683
<v Speaker 1>it's because they have enough archetipal</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth so that there's many situations </v>

677
00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:47.860
<v Speaker 1>that they're relevant to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

678
00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:49.413
<v Speaker 1>sometimes mother nature is your best </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend and sometimes it's your worst </v>

679
00:39:52.481 --> 00:39:53.314
<v Speaker 1>enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>SO you could go down to the jungles of </v>

680
00:39:55.271 --> 00:39:56.104
<v Speaker 1>Peru and you could talk to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who lived there and you can find </v>

681
00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:05.140
<v Speaker 1>out what they know about medicinal </v>
<v Speaker 1>plants in the jungle.</v>

682
00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:06.303
<v Speaker 1>And you could bring home thingS to cure </v>
<v Speaker 1>dIsease or you could just go down there </v>

683
00:40:09.911 --> 00:40:12.070
<v Speaker 1>and get lost in the jungle and then your</v>
<v Speaker 1>dad,</v>

684
00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:13.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in,</v>

685
00:40:13.241 --> 00:40:18.241
<v Speaker 1>in some sense it's the same jungle and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's positive or negative,</v>

686
00:40:18.761 --> 00:40:23.110
<v Speaker 1>depends on what stance you take towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and how you behave.</v>

687
00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:26.560
<v Speaker 1>And so the other thing that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about mythology,</v>

688
00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:29.140
<v Speaker 1>and this is the lovely element of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythology,</v>

689
00:40:29.141 --> 00:40:29.974
<v Speaker 1>is that part of what it does is tell you</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to take this incredibly complex </v>

690
00:40:33.401 --> 00:40:37.030
<v Speaker 1>landscape that's positive and negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time,</v>

691
00:40:37.031 --> 00:40:42.031
<v Speaker 1>at every level of analysis and how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>navigate through it so that the belt,</v>

692
00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:48.060
<v Speaker 1>the proper balance is maintained as far </v>
<v Speaker 1>as really as far as the entire system is</v>

693
00:40:48.851 --> 00:40:50.710
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

694
00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:56.770
<v Speaker 1>so that culture has an orderly element </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what protects us here.</v>

695
00:40:56.771 --> 00:40:57.604
<v Speaker 1>And it has a tyrannical element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what makes you treated like </v>

696
00:40:59.921 --> 00:41:02.160
<v Speaker 1>numbers at the university of toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

697
00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.540
<v Speaker 1>you get both of those have exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>

698
00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:05.973
<v Speaker 1>And then the architect will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual has the same fundamental </v>

699
00:41:08.471 --> 00:41:10.780
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hero or villain.</v>

700
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:12.010
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

701
00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:12.843
<v Speaker 1>those have archetypal roots because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate hero is the ultimate perfect </v>

702
00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:19.160
<v Speaker 1>person and the ultimate villain is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

703
00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:22.420
<v Speaker 1>satan himself in whatever for me happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take,</v>

704
00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.033
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

705
00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:30.460
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't take much knowledge of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure before you can start seeing it</v>

706
00:41:30.461 --> 00:41:31.294
<v Speaker 1>manifest itself all over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially especially movies that are </v>

707
00:41:33.771 --> 00:41:34.604
<v Speaker 1>particularly popular because they almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>always have a central architectural </v>

708
00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:37.953
<v Speaker 1>feat.</v>

709
00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:41.000
<v Speaker 1>The marvel superhero movies are a really</v>
<v Speaker 1>good example of that.</v>

710
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:42.900
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

711
00:41:42.901 --> 00:41:47.450
<v Speaker 1>and if it's complex literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the architects are mixed to some degree.</v>

712
00:41:47.451 --> 00:41:50.450
<v Speaker 1>So you have a hero who's not only a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hero,</v>

713
00:41:50.451 --> 00:41:52.640
<v Speaker 1>you have a hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has all sorts of flaws,</v>

714
00:41:52.641 --> 00:41:53.474
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had these in the culture or she's in a </v>

715
00:41:54.891 --> 00:41:55.724
<v Speaker 1>culture that has positive elements and </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative elements that they're in a </v>

716
00:41:58.700 --> 00:41:59.533
<v Speaker 1>broader landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This characterized by exactly the same </v>

717
00:42:02.361 --> 00:42:03.830
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's nuanced,</v>

718
00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:06.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the more sophisticated you get,</v>

719
00:42:06.801 --> 00:42:08.990
<v Speaker 1>the more you can tolerate that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuance.</v>

720
00:42:08.991 --> 00:42:09.824
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's also one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that's partly why literature is </v>

721
00:42:12.081 --> 00:42:12.914
<v Speaker 1>such a good antidote to radiology </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the more sophisticated the </v>

722
00:42:16.731 --> 00:42:17.564
<v Speaker 1>literature becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more complex and fragmented in some </v>

723
00:42:21.501 --> 00:42:22.334
<v Speaker 1>sense or no differentiated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more differentiated the </v>

724
00:42:24.681 --> 00:42:29.681
<v Speaker 1>architectural landscape becomes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when someone tells you a story,</v>

725
00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:31.214
<v Speaker 1>whatever the story happens to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you can do when you </v>

726
00:42:33.651 --> 00:42:35.300
<v Speaker 1>know the substructures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

727
00:42:35.301 --> 00:42:35.991
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

728
00:42:35.991 --> 00:42:37.640
<v Speaker 1>but where were the missing pieces?</v>

729
00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:39.523
<v Speaker 1>Where are they going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if they're not included and </v>

730
00:42:41.061 --> 00:42:44.540
<v Speaker 1>they're generally projected onto </v>
<v Speaker 1>something because they're there,</v>

731
00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:48.260
<v Speaker 1>you can't get away from there there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does the person account for them?</v>

732
00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:49.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

733
00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:52.253
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then now I want to tell you another </v>

734
00:42:53.391 --> 00:42:54.224
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we talked about the mesopotamian </v>

735
00:42:57.051 --> 00:42:57.884
<v Speaker 1>creation last can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I want to tell you about the </v>

736
00:42:59.811 --> 00:43:00.644
<v Speaker 1>egyptian myth of sovereignty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the first thing I should do is </v>

737
00:43:04.401 --> 00:43:05.234
<v Speaker 1>say that all of the stories that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to you about have all sorts of </v>

738
00:43:09.291 --> 00:43:10.610
<v Speaker 1>variance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

739
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.863
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the egyptian story that I'm going to </v>

740
00:43:14.331 --> 00:43:17.840
<v Speaker 1>describe lasted for thousands and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years.</v>

741
00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:20.600
<v Speaker 1>So it isn't like there was only one </v>
<v Speaker 1>variation of it,</v>

742
00:43:20.601 --> 00:43:21.434
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of variations of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm only going to tell you one of </v>

743
00:43:23.751 --> 00:43:24.584
<v Speaker 1>them and that's a limitation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's just how it is for the time </v>

744
00:43:28.881 --> 00:43:29.714
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

745
00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:33.440
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not saying that this is the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>version of this story,</v>

746
00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:35.533
<v Speaker 1>but it's average in and it's the one I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>most familiar with and so I can talk </v>

747
00:43:38.841 --> 00:43:43.841
<v Speaker 1>about it hopefully with some utility and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great story.</v>

748
00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.370
<v Speaker 1>When I finally figured out what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>meant,</v>

749
00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:47.233
<v Speaker 1>it's so cool with some of these stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you crack them and you're able </v>

750
00:43:50.181 --> 00:43:53.780
<v Speaker 1>to see what they mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're absolutely overwhelming.</v>

751
00:43:53.781 --> 00:43:55.910
<v Speaker 1>There are so bloody brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

752
00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:58.790
<v Speaker 1>it's no wonder that people regard them </v>
<v Speaker 1>as revelatory,</v>

753
00:43:59.130 --> 00:43:59.963
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of divine origin because they have such </v>

754
00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:05.840
<v Speaker 1>power that it's almost impossible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine how that got there.</v>

755
00:44:05.841 --> 00:44:09.890
<v Speaker 1>Now I have provided you with a darwinian</v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation of how that got there,</v>

756
00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:10.803
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the stories are representations </v>

757
00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:13.693
<v Speaker 1>of</v>
<v Speaker 1>social contracts and behavioral </v>

758
00:44:16.611 --> 00:44:20.030
<v Speaker 1>tendencies that have evolved over </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands of years.</v>

759
00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.070
<v Speaker 1>Because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the representation,</v>

760
00:44:22.071 --> 00:44:22.904
<v Speaker 1>the story is going to have way more </v>
<v Speaker 1>information in it than a typical story </v>

761
00:44:26.241 --> 00:44:27.074
<v Speaker 1>might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I still can understand how these </v>

762
00:44:29.631 --> 00:44:30.920
<v Speaker 1>things burst upon people.</v>

763
00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:33.340
<v Speaker 1>The force of revelation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

764
00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:35.550
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that's quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting too,</v>

765
00:44:35.551 --> 00:44:36.384
<v Speaker 1>if you look at cultures historically is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you usually find that the </v>

766
00:44:39.841 --> 00:44:44.040
<v Speaker 1>revelation of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the energy source on which the</v>

767
00:44:44.041 --> 00:44:46.890
<v Speaker 1>culture feeds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the story comes first.</v>

768
00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:47.993
<v Speaker 1>It has this tremendous dynamic energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The culture basically uses that energy </v>

769
00:44:52.441 --> 00:44:54.140
<v Speaker 1>to propel itself through time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

770
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.983
<v Speaker 1>to give it conviction and force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then at some point the story </v>

771
00:44:58.501 --> 00:45:01.500
<v Speaker 1>exhausts itself and that would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent in some sense,</v>

772
00:45:01.501 --> 00:45:03.600
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to nietzsche's announcement of the death</v>

773
00:45:03.601 --> 00:45:06.540
<v Speaker 1>of god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this has happened many times.</v>

774
00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:09.780
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

775
00:45:09.781 --> 00:45:13.620
<v Speaker 1>so there's four main characters in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>egyptian story.</v>

776
00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:19.880
<v Speaker 1>There's cyrus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isis set and horace now.</v>

777
00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:23.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sarah's.</v>

778
00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:24.803
<v Speaker 1>We'll start with those series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could start with any of the </v>

779
00:45:26.281 --> 00:45:30.000
<v Speaker 1>characters because one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's quite interesting about mythology</v>

780
00:45:30.001 --> 00:45:30.834
<v Speaker 1>is that the myths don't make any </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction between the causal priority </v>

781
00:45:34.141 --> 00:45:35.100
<v Speaker 1>of these characters.</v>

782
00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:38.940
<v Speaker 1>Any of them can be regarded as </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental,</v>

783
00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:42.240
<v Speaker 1>so the hero is the person who separates </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

784
00:45:42.241 --> 00:45:43.410
<v Speaker 1>Parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

785
00:45:43.411 --> 00:45:47.280
<v Speaker 1>it brings being into existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can also say,</v>

786
00:45:47.281 --> 00:45:48.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's time math,</v>

787
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:53.310
<v Speaker 1>which is more how the mesopotamian </v>
<v Speaker 1>creation myth is tilted.</v>

788
00:45:53.311 --> 00:45:54.270
<v Speaker 1>Or you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

789
00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:55.283
<v Speaker 1>you can't make sense out of anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you have a cultural lens through </v>

790
00:45:58.801 --> 00:45:59.634
<v Speaker 1>which you're looking like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there has to be some preexisting </v>

791
00:46:01.851 --> 00:46:05.940
<v Speaker 1>structure before information can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>generated in any manner,</v>

792
00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:09.780
<v Speaker 1>so you're always stuck with this problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in order for something to exist,</v>

793
00:46:09.781 --> 00:46:10.614
<v Speaker 1>you need a substrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need an interpretive structure and </v>

794
00:46:14.281 --> 00:46:15.114
<v Speaker 1>you need an interpreter and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can't say that one of those </v>

795
00:46:18.721 --> 00:46:19.554
<v Speaker 1>things precedes the other there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all have to be there at the same </v>

796
00:46:22.051 --> 00:46:22.884
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say from a darwinian </v>

797
00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:26.543
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all emerged and complexified in </v>

798
00:46:29.581 --> 00:46:31.350
<v Speaker 1>unison like that.</v>

799
00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:32.310
<v Speaker 1>As,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

800
00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:36.750
<v Speaker 1>as time progressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't explain how the origin of the</v>

801
00:46:36.751 --> 00:46:38.220
<v Speaker 1>orange originated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

802
00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:40.890
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've got to osiris now.</v>

803
00:46:40.891 --> 00:46:45.891
<v Speaker 1>Osiris is the founder of the egyptian </v>
<v Speaker 1>state and so you know,</v>

804
00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:47.873
<v Speaker 1>before people wrote things down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to kind of try to understand </v>

805
00:46:53.731 --> 00:46:58.320
<v Speaker 1>how it was that they remembered things </v>
<v Speaker 1>like they,</v>

806
00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:03.950
<v Speaker 1>their memory was more like an amalgam or</v>
<v Speaker 1>adjust.</v>

807
00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:06.210
<v Speaker 1>So we already know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

808
00:47:06.211 --> 00:47:10.590
<v Speaker 1>if you tell the story of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your actions yesterday,</v>

809
00:47:10.591 --> 00:47:13.500
<v Speaker 1>that it doesn't take you 16 hours to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell the story,</v>

810
00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:18.410
<v Speaker 1>hopefully takes you like five minutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and why that is,</v>

811
00:47:18.411 --> 00:47:20.790
<v Speaker 1>it's not obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but part of the reason is,</v>

812
00:47:20.791 --> 00:47:25.791
<v Speaker 1>is that for whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for whatever underlying reasons,</v>

813
00:47:25.831 --> 00:47:26.664
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what parts of the story are relevant to </v>

814
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:29.913
<v Speaker 1>people and what parts aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically what you're going to do is </v>

815
00:47:32.951 --> 00:47:33.784
<v Speaker 1>try not to tell them things they already</v>
<v Speaker 1>know because that would just be </v>

816
00:47:37.151 --> 00:47:37.720
<v Speaker 1>pointless.</v>

817
00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:38.553
<v Speaker 1>And in order to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you more or less have to know what they </v>

818
00:47:40.601 --> 00:47:44.220
<v Speaker 1>know and what they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to more or less stay on the</v>

819
00:47:44.221 --> 00:47:45.640
<v Speaker 1>edge of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can do that.</v>

820
00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might ask you what,</v>

821
00:47:48.491 --> 00:47:49.324
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you do over the last three </v>

822
00:47:50.381 --> 00:47:51.370
<v Speaker 1>months?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or I could sAy,</v>

823
00:47:51.371 --> 00:47:52.204
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what have you done for the last couple </v>

824
00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:54.041
<v Speaker 1>of years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in each case,</v>

825
00:47:54.041 --> 00:47:56.740
<v Speaker 1>you're going to collapse that into some </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

826
00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:01.510
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine that the problem you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to solve is what did your culture</v>

827
00:48:01.511 --> 00:48:05.110
<v Speaker 1>do for the last 5,000 years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

828
00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:10.720
<v Speaker 1>imagine that there are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are.</v>

829
00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:16.200
<v Speaker 1>The culture in part is being continually</v>
<v Speaker 1>informed by the individuals that compose</v>

830
00:48:16.601 --> 00:48:17.434
<v Speaker 1>it and they're going to be different </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals have different stature who </v>

831
00:48:21.821 --> 00:48:23.770
<v Speaker 1>discovered things of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

832
00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:24.693
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we we often know some people lIke </v>

833
00:48:26.381 --> 00:48:27.880
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know if thomas edison,</v>

834
00:48:27.881 --> 00:48:30.610
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we can name actual people,</v>

835
00:48:30.611 --> 00:48:31.444
<v Speaker 1>but that's partly because we write </v>
<v Speaker 1>things down in records of can imagine </v>

836
00:48:34.751 --> 00:48:35.584
<v Speaker 1>though that you're trying to represent </v>
<v Speaker 1>your history in a way that you can </v>

837
00:48:40.451 --> 00:48:40.960
<v Speaker 1>remember.</v>

838
00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:41.793
<v Speaker 1>You're going to tell the stories about </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who've done interesting things </v>

839
00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:46.323
<v Speaker 1>because that's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when you tell a story about </v>

840
00:48:47.681 --> 00:48:48.514
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine you tell one story about </v>

841
00:48:50.441 --> 00:48:51.274
<v Speaker 1>someone who did something interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you tell another story about </v>

842
00:48:53.351 --> 00:48:56.020
<v Speaker 1>someone else who did something </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting and so forth,</v>

843
00:48:56.021 --> 00:49:00.640
<v Speaker 1>and that's continually going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say in a tribal archaic culture,</v>

844
00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:02.013
<v Speaker 1>and so then what you get is a set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories about people doing interesting </v>

845
00:49:05.081 --> 00:49:06.640
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

846
00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:08.313
<v Speaker 1>it's easy for that to shift into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestors doing interesting things and </v>

847
00:49:12.731 --> 00:49:13.564
<v Speaker 1>then it's easy for them to shift into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ancestor doing wonderful things and </v>

848
00:49:17.741 --> 00:49:18.574
<v Speaker 1>that's basically what happens is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the emergence of the culture </v>

849
00:49:21.881 --> 00:49:22.714
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something like a small set of </v>

850
00:49:24.971 --> 00:49:25.804
<v Speaker 1>culture heroes who've done all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are worth doing and what </v>

851
00:49:29.141 --> 00:49:33.010
<v Speaker 1>you're doing is imitating them and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know this is,</v>

852
00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:33.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

853
00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:34.803
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your empirical memory of events only </v>

854
00:49:39.251 --> 00:49:41.440
<v Speaker 1>lasts about 100 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

855
00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:42.273
<v Speaker 1>Because there isn't anyone old enough to</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember anything past that and so what </v>

856
00:49:45.731 --> 00:49:49.660
<v Speaker 1>has to happen is that everything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened before that has to be collapsed</v>

857
00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:54.280
<v Speaker 1>into some form that's memorable so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be brought forward and taught.</v>

858
00:49:54.310 --> 00:49:55.960
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how these.</v>

859
00:49:56.110 --> 00:49:58.360
<v Speaker 1>That's the function of these stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these stories.</v>

860
00:49:58.361 --> 00:49:59.194
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost as if the story has </v>

861
00:50:01.931 --> 00:50:02.764
<v Speaker 1>abandoned everything that hasn't stuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>in people's memories and so all that's </v>

862
00:50:06.941 --> 00:50:11.941
<v Speaker 1>left is the most significant is the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>significance because otherwise why would</v>

863
00:50:12.431 --> 00:50:14.320
<v Speaker 1>people bother with it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't tell the story.</v>

864
00:50:14.321 --> 00:50:18.360
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't be gripped by it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so okay,</v>

865
00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:20.350
<v Speaker 1>so cyrus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's one of these figures.</v>

866
00:50:20.351 --> 00:50:21.184
<v Speaker 1>You could think if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you allow people to tell stories </v>

867
00:50:23.471 --> 00:50:24.304
<v Speaker 1>about George Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say in a bleak and an all the semi </v>

868
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:29.510
<v Speaker 1>mythologized founders of the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

869
00:50:29.511 --> 00:50:30.344
<v Speaker 1>if you allowed people in the absence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>textbooks and writing to tell stories </v>

870
00:50:34.551 --> 00:50:38.840
<v Speaker 1>about those men for the next thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

871
00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:39.883
<v Speaker 1>maybe what you'd get out of that is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>origin story of the mythic founder of </v>

872
00:50:43.161 --> 00:50:43.994
<v Speaker 1>the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that seems to be what's happened In </v>

873
00:50:46.251 --> 00:50:48.050
<v Speaker 1>the egyptian case with cyrus.</v>

874
00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:50.660
<v Speaker 1>Now he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a god,</v>

875
00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:53.503
<v Speaker 1>but he's got human characteristics and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's also granted the the status of </v>

876
00:50:59.061 --> 00:51:01.640
<v Speaker 1>something that's eternal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

877
00:51:01.641 --> 00:51:04.940
<v Speaker 1>Now here's the story of osiris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking,</v>

878
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:09.830
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of old now and he's little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>blind,</v>

879
00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:11.233
<v Speaker 1>but he's blind in a specific way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the way that he specifically blind </v>

880
00:51:14.181 --> 00:51:17.420
<v Speaker 1>is that he's willfully blind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

881
00:51:17.421 --> 00:51:19.370
<v Speaker 1>If you're willfully blind to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>egyptian,</v>

882
00:51:19.371 --> 00:51:24.320
<v Speaker 1>say this straightforwardly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't tell you why they believe this.</v>

883
00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:25.423
<v Speaker 1>If you're willfully blind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's things that you could know that </v>

884
00:51:27.531 --> 00:51:28.364
<v Speaker 1>you take pains not to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and willful blindness under english </v>

885
00:51:32.901 --> 00:51:37.460
<v Speaker 1>common law can be grounds for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for criminal convictions.</v>

886
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:38.323
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you run a company and you think that </v>

887
00:51:40.731 --> 00:51:41.564
<v Speaker 1>your treasure is cooking the books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's working to your favor and you </v>

888
00:51:45.501 --> 00:51:46.520
<v Speaker 1>decide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

889
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:49.970
<v Speaker 1>I just won't look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then later it comes out,</v>

890
00:51:49.971 --> 00:51:50.601
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

891
00:51:50.601 --> 00:51:51.500
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>

892
00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:53.690
<v Speaker 1>And people who are prosecuting and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

893
00:51:53.691 --> 00:51:57.590
<v Speaker 1>but you could have known and he took a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious choice not to know.</v>

894
00:51:57.591 --> 00:51:58.424
<v Speaker 1>So you're culpable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's actually the best </v>

895
00:52:01.101 --> 00:52:01.934
<v Speaker 1>model of friday and repression in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentences that it isn't exactly </v>

896
00:52:04.941 --> 00:52:05.774
<v Speaker 1>repression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's failure to make the effort to know </v>

897
00:52:08.691 --> 00:52:13.691
<v Speaker 1>something that you could know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now sometimes look,</v>

898
00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:15.590
<v Speaker 1>sometimes something terrible happens to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

899
00:52:15.591 --> 00:52:16.424
<v Speaker 1>You just can't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes something terrible is </v>

900
00:52:19.071 --> 00:52:23.180
<v Speaker 1>happening and you refuse to think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and because you refuse to think about</v>

901
00:52:23.181 --> 00:52:24.770
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really don't know what it is.</v>

902
00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:26.260
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

903
00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:27.303
<v Speaker 1>and you mIght say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I can't be culpable then because I </v>

904
00:52:28.851 --> 00:52:29.684
<v Speaker 1>don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could have known so you're </v>

905
00:52:32.391 --> 00:52:33.224
<v Speaker 1>culpable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's voluntary ignorance and that's </v>

906
00:52:36.561 --> 00:52:39.920
<v Speaker 1>the problem with cyrus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a great guy when he was young,</v>

907
00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:42.620
<v Speaker 1>he was a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He founded the egyptian state,</v>

908
00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:44.300
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not.</v>

909
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:49.520
<v Speaker 1>Everything could be anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got anachronistic and outdated and,</v>

910
00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:52.010
<v Speaker 1>and willfully blind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is even worse.</v>

911
00:52:52.011 --> 00:52:55.160
<v Speaker 1>Now there's an idea here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a bloody brilliant idea.</v>

912
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:58.640
<v Speaker 1>It's mind boggling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I saw her or cyrus is the,</v>

913
00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:00.103
<v Speaker 1>is the state manifested in personified </v>
<v Speaker 1>form and that's reasonable because the </v>

914
00:53:05.451 --> 00:53:09.800
<v Speaker 1>state is like a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The person of the state is manifested in</v>

915
00:53:09.801 --> 00:53:10.634
<v Speaker 1>the body of laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys all imitate that body of laws </v>

916
00:53:16.641 --> 00:53:19.400
<v Speaker 1>and that's what basically makes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>citizens of the state.</v>

917
00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:26.650
<v Speaker 1>You okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good,</v>

918
00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:29.130
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what makes you citizens of the</v>

919
00:53:29.131 --> 00:53:31.110
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can all get along because all of you</v>

920
00:53:31.111 --> 00:53:31.944
<v Speaker 1>are imitating the same thing and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're imitating is the central body of </v>

921
00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:41.190
<v Speaker 1>custom and law that makes up the state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you can predict each other.</v>

922
00:53:41.310 --> 00:53:43.920
<v Speaker 1>So that makes you a good citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>

923
00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:48.060
<v Speaker 1>the problem with being a good citizen is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sometimes if you're a good citizen,</v>

924
00:53:48.061 --> 00:53:50.040
<v Speaker 1>you're a bad person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

925
00:53:50.041 --> 00:53:51.900
<v Speaker 1>That's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

926
00:53:52.170 --> 00:53:56.100
<v Speaker 1>the better you were at being a nazi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in all likelihood,</v>

927
00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:59.770
<v Speaker 1>the worst a person you were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a,</v>

928
00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:00.673
<v Speaker 1>that's a very useful observation because</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that shows us that </v>

929
00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:04.763
<v Speaker 1>even though it's necessary for you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>imitate the central personality of the </v>

930
00:54:08.791 --> 00:54:09.624
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the central personality with </v>

931
00:54:11.581 --> 00:54:12.414
<v Speaker 1>the state can be pathological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the egyptians who established a </v>

932
00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:17.940
<v Speaker 1>quite a lengthy state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

933
00:54:17.941 --> 00:54:20.940
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to say to the mesopotamians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the egyptians had been</v>

934
00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:26.280
<v Speaker 1>existing in a complex state apparatus </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a very long period of time.</v>

935
00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:31.200
<v Speaker 1>they started to encounter problems that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were intrinsic to the state.</v>

936
00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:34.650
<v Speaker 1>And remember in the mesopotamian </v>
<v Speaker 1>creation myth,</v>

937
00:54:34.651 --> 00:54:37.250
<v Speaker 1>the primary danger was tire map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

938
00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:40.790
<v Speaker 1>you make a lot of racket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kill appsu that's ordered,</v>

939
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.990
<v Speaker 1>timeout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes flooding back and takes you out.</v>

940
00:54:42.991 --> 00:54:43.824
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine that that would be the </v>

941
00:54:44.431 --> 00:54:48.510
<v Speaker 1>primary story of people in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization that was somewhat fragile.</v>

942
00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:53.100
<v Speaker 1>There are a hell of a lot more worried </v>
<v Speaker 1>about being invaded by the next round of</v>

943
00:54:53.101 --> 00:54:53.934
<v Speaker 1>barbarians are having their crops fail </v>
<v Speaker 1>or being flooded out or something like </v>

944
00:54:56.791 --> 00:55:00.790
<v Speaker 1>that than they are concerned about </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not the whole state apparatus</v>

945
00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:01.673
<v Speaker 1>become corrupted is going to collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they're partly concerned about that </v>

946
00:55:04.771 --> 00:55:06.960
<v Speaker 1>because remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>martech is supposed to be.</v>

947
00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:08.033
<v Speaker 1>The emperor is supposed to be being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good marduk and keeping an eye on </v>

948
00:55:10.951 --> 00:55:12.480
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the myth,</v>

949
00:55:13.170 --> 00:55:16.410
<v Speaker 1>the mythic structure only talks about </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute tiny little bit.</v>

950
00:55:16.650 --> 00:55:17.483
<v Speaker 1>They basically say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't kill timeouts consort or you'll </v>

951
00:55:20.041 --> 00:55:21.690
<v Speaker 1>make her angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

952
00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:24.740
<v Speaker 1>The egyptians take that lot farther.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look at,</v>

953
00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:25.381
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cyrus.</v>

954
00:55:25.381 --> 00:55:25.981
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

955
00:55:25.981 --> 00:55:26.814
<v Speaker 1>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was really something good about </v>

956
00:55:27.991 --> 00:55:28.920
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without him,</v>

957
00:55:28.921 --> 00:55:29.754
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't even have our state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we bloody well better be happy about </v>

958
00:55:32.521 --> 00:55:35.940
<v Speaker 1>that because the state is better than no</v>
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>

959
00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:38.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>path a lot.</v>

960
00:55:38.191 --> 00:55:41.340
<v Speaker 1>You could say pathological order is </v>
<v Speaker 1>better than absolute chaos.</v>

961
00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:43.890
<v Speaker 1>Now you can have an argument about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>

962
00:55:43.891 --> 00:55:44.700
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

963
00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:46.890
<v Speaker 1>depends on how pathological the order </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

964
00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:51.300
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't that untrammeled chaos is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good solution.</v>

965
00:55:52.290 --> 00:55:55.440
<v Speaker 1>I think that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm only using this as an example,</v>

966
00:55:56.860 --> 00:56:00.360
<v Speaker 1>you know the americans well and us as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

967
00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:05.410
<v Speaker 1>We went into Iraq to take out a person </v>
<v Speaker 1>who is clearly a dictator and who had,</v>

968
00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:11.250
<v Speaker 1>who is a pretty bad guy and who had </v>
<v Speaker 1>really bad sons,</v>

969
00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:12.713
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his heroes were people like stalin </v>

970
00:56:13.981 --> 00:56:14.814
<v Speaker 1>and hitler.</v>

971
00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they took them out.</v>

972
00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:22.460
<v Speaker 1>Well then what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then all hell broke loose,</v>

973
00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:24.153
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the theory was you take out the </v>

974
00:56:26.861 --> 00:56:30.790
<v Speaker 1>bad guy at the top and all the good guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the bottom get together and instantly</v>

975
00:56:30.791 --> 00:56:33.340
<v Speaker 1>they have a good governments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that isn't what happened at all.</v>

976
00:56:33.341 --> 00:56:37.300
<v Speaker 1>What happened was the whole state </v>
<v Speaker 1>degenerated into chaos and partly out of</v>

977
00:56:37.301 --> 00:56:38.134
<v Speaker 1>that chaos came isis and it's not self </v>
<v Speaker 1>evident that isis is preferable to who </v>

978
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:46.930
<v Speaker 1>saying least hussein educated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>older women,</v>

979
00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:49.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was relatively secular.</v>

980
00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:50.643
<v Speaker 1>All things considered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not making a case for who's </v>

981
00:56:53.071 --> 00:56:54.140
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My point is,</v>

982
00:56:54.141 --> 00:56:55.420
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

983
00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:59.110
<v Speaker 1>you have to be careful when you disrupt </v>
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>

984
00:56:59.111 --> 00:56:59.944
<v Speaker 1>even if it's pathological because he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>god only knows what's going to spring </v>

985
00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:03.493
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't mean that you should </v>

986
00:57:04.841 --> 00:57:07.270
<v Speaker 1>never try to overcome pathological </v>
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>

987
00:57:07.271 --> 00:57:09.070
<v Speaker 1>but it does mean that you should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

988
00:57:09.071 --> 00:57:09.790
<v Speaker 1>very careful.</v>

989
00:57:09.790 --> 00:57:11.530
<v Speaker 1>we need to do so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

990
00:57:11.570 --> 00:57:12.403
<v Speaker 1>you have to do a micro analysis in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense to make sure that you know what </v>

991
00:57:15.071 --> 00:57:17.950
<v Speaker 1>the hell you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

992
00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:19.170
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyway,</v>

993
00:57:19.171 --> 00:57:20.860
<v Speaker 1>so why is cyrus?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a good guy,</v>

994
00:57:20.861 --> 00:57:22.270
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He established the state,</v>

995
00:57:22.271 --> 00:57:24.250
<v Speaker 1>he was awake guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a hero.</v>

996
00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:25.093
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he made order out of chaos and that's </v>

997
00:57:28.661 --> 00:57:29.890
<v Speaker 1>where you live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So great.</v>

998
00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:30.753
<v Speaker 1>But he's a little old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little out of date and he's willfully </v>

999
00:57:35.201 --> 00:57:37.750
<v Speaker 1>blind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's so smart because I think what</v>

1000
00:57:37.751 --> 00:57:38.584
<v Speaker 1>the egyptians did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his cow encapsulate in narrative form </v>

1001
00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:44.530
<v Speaker 1>the primary danger of all human </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions.</v>

1002
00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:45.453
<v Speaker 1>There's two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And ellie added talks about this a lot </v>

1003
00:57:47.771 --> 00:57:51.430
<v Speaker 1>with regards to flood mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's an example.</v>

1004
00:57:51.431 --> 00:57:52.264
<v Speaker 1>So there are flood myths all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and there may have even been a </v>

1005
00:57:54.971 --> 00:57:55.804
<v Speaker 1>flood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's pretty good archeological </v>

1006
00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:58.360
<v Speaker 1>evidence for that.</v>

1007
00:57:58.420 --> 00:57:59.253
<v Speaker 1>That there was a great flood about </v>
<v Speaker 1>13,000 years ago when a bunch of </v>

1008
00:58:01.331 --> 00:58:04.120
<v Speaker 1>comments hit the earth and melted the </v>
<v Speaker 1>north american ice shield,</v>

1009
00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:05.493
<v Speaker 1>but we won't get into that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but doesn't really matter because the </v>

1010
00:58:08.441 --> 00:58:12.940
<v Speaker 1>mythological substructure of the story </v>
<v Speaker 1>still has the same meaning regardless of</v>

1011
00:58:12.941 --> 00:58:16.780
<v Speaker 1>its historical reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the biblical story of the flood,</v>

1012
00:58:16.781 --> 00:58:20.110
<v Speaker 1>basically what happens is that humanity </v>
<v Speaker 1>is created.</v>

1013
00:58:20.111 --> 00:58:24.700
<v Speaker 1>Then they degenerate rapidly and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>get so degenerate,</v>

1014
00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:25.593
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of like the elder gods </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting out of hand in the mesopotamian </v>

1015
00:58:27.911 --> 00:58:30.580
<v Speaker 1>story that god thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh to hell with all of you.</v>

1016
00:58:30.581 --> 00:58:32.140
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a big mistake.</v>

1017
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:34.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to wipe you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1018
00:58:34.901 --> 00:58:37.320
<v Speaker 1>But he finds one good guy that's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>nolan,</v>

1019
00:58:37.450 --> 00:58:40.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of noah who's like another adam.</v>

1020
00:58:40.330 --> 00:58:43.620
<v Speaker 1>In some sense the world is of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings is regenerated.</v>

1021
00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:48.190
<v Speaker 1>But the idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that corrupt people get washed away.</v>

1022
00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:51.033
<v Speaker 1>So and eliana talks about the flood myth</v>
<v Speaker 1>all over the world or change it and he </v>

1023
00:58:55.811 --> 00:58:56.644
<v Speaker 1>says that generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two reasons why the dante's </v>

1024
00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:04.660
<v Speaker 1>flood the planet and what is the system </v>
<v Speaker 1>is old and out of date.</v>

1025
00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:05.973
<v Speaker 1>And the second is that people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt and then if you get the two </v>

1026
00:59:08.291 --> 00:59:11.310
<v Speaker 1>things working together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a system that's out of date that</v>

1027
00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:14.050
<v Speaker 1>becomes pathological faster because </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are corrupt.</v>

1028
00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:19.780
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that you can use the </v>
<v Speaker 1>flooded new orleans is a good example of</v>

1029
00:59:19.781 --> 00:59:21.710
<v Speaker 1>that because on the one hand you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1030
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:25.790
<v Speaker 1>well it was a hurricane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's a natural disaster.</v>

1031
00:59:25.791 --> 00:59:28.130
<v Speaker 1>But on the other hand you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1032
00:59:28.610 --> 00:59:33.610
<v Speaker 1>people knew the dam dykes were too weak </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they didn't do anything about it.</v>

1033
00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:36.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were only built for 100 year storm.</v>

1034
00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:39.650
<v Speaker 1>And Louisiana is corrupt beyond belief.</v>

1035
00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:41.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a democratic state,</v>

1036
00:59:41.601 --> 00:59:43.370
<v Speaker 1>it's not corrupt compared to most </v>
<v Speaker 1>states,</v>

1037
00:59:43.371 --> 00:59:45.980
<v Speaker 1>but it's really corrupt compared to most</v>
<v Speaker 1>democratic states.</v>

1038
00:59:45.981 --> 00:59:46.814
<v Speaker 1>And if you dump money into Louisiana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just goes into people's pockets </v>

1039
00:59:49.131 --> 00:59:51.200
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the infrastructure doesn't get fixed</v>

1040
00:59:51.201 --> 00:59:53.120
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you might ask yourself,</v>

1041
00:59:53.121 --> 00:59:53.954
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the flood of consequence of a </v>

1042
00:59:54.771 --> 00:59:57.410
<v Speaker 1>natural disaster or the blindness of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture?</v>

1043
00:59:57.830 --> 00:59:58.663
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can never tell which of those are </v>

1044
01:00:00.951 --> 01:00:01.790
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1045
01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:05.060
<v Speaker 1>if you freeze to death in the winter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it because it's colder because you're</v>

1046
01:00:05.061 --> 01:00:06.770
<v Speaker 1>stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1047
01:00:06.850 --> 01:00:07.610
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1048
01:00:07.610 --> 01:00:10.160
<v Speaker 1>there's no difference between those two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1049
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:11.503
<v Speaker 1>So if you get wiped out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because nature comes after you and </v>

1050
01:00:14.241 --> 01:00:15.074
<v Speaker 1>because your culture isn't sufficient to</v>
<v Speaker 1>protect you and so you can't separate </v>

1051
01:00:18.651 --> 01:00:20.600
<v Speaker 1>those two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1052
01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:24.500
<v Speaker 1>So now the other case that the egyptians</v>
<v Speaker 1>are making,</v>

1053
01:00:24.501 --> 01:00:27.880
<v Speaker 1>and this is quite cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you take a system that's it's</v>

1054
01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:32.540
<v Speaker 1>doing just fine and you just leave it </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone long enough,</v>

1055
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:36.380
<v Speaker 1>it becomes dysfunctional and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of reasons for that.</v>

1056
01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:37.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1057
01:00:37.210 --> 01:00:38.043
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you imagined that you take your laptop </v>

1058
01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:42.493
<v Speaker 1>and it's in perfect working order and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you put it in the closet for 20 years </v>

1059
01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:48.320
<v Speaker 1>and you take it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you have?</v>

1060
01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:51.890
<v Speaker 1>It'll still turn on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a laptop?</v>

1061
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1062
01:00:53.330 --> 01:00:54.163
<v Speaker 1>You know by then it won't even work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Won't be able to communicate with the </v>

1063
01:00:58.191 --> 01:00:59.024
<v Speaker 1>internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There won't be any peripherals that can </v>

1064
01:01:00.381 --> 01:01:01.214
<v Speaker 1>plug into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The software be so outdated that you </v>

1065
01:01:02.811 --> 01:01:05.840
<v Speaker 1>won't even know how to use It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a brick basically.</v>

1066
01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.700
<v Speaker 1>And so the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

1067
01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:10.070
<v Speaker 1>and you can really see this with </v>
<v Speaker 1>electronic equipment,</v>

1068
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:11.833
<v Speaker 1>a perfectly functional thing maintained </v>
<v Speaker 1>in status of its own accord becomes </v>

1069
01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:17.593
<v Speaker 1>dysfunctional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is you have to </v>

1070
01:01:19.611 --> 01:01:23.630
<v Speaker 1>run around like a mad hyena,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just keeping your things working.</v>

1071
01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:26.210
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course you know that because like how</v>

1072
01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.630
<v Speaker 1>much time do you spend in a month </v>
<v Speaker 1>updating your electronics,</v>

1073
01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a treadmill of update,</v>

1074
01:01:32.570 --> 01:01:34.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think part of the reason that they</v>

1075
01:01:34.701 --> 01:01:35.534
<v Speaker 1>haven't contributed much to overall </v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity is because people take all </v>

1076
01:01:38.721 --> 01:01:39.110
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

1077
01:01:39.110 --> 01:01:42.050
<v Speaker 1>They used to waste typing things out on </v>
<v Speaker 1>paper,</v>

1078
01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:43.630
<v Speaker 1>trying to keep their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

1079
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:47.180
<v Speaker 1>they're efficient electronics actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>working and you know,</v>

1080
01:01:47.181 --> 01:01:49.850
<v Speaker 1>learning all the things you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn and relearning them.</v>

1081
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:53.540
<v Speaker 1>There's this scene in alice in </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderland,</v>

1082
01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:55.580
<v Speaker 1>alice is in underwear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1083
01:01:56.690 --> 01:02:01.010
<v Speaker 1>And she meets the red queen down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's mother nature and she's always</v>

1084
01:02:01.011 --> 01:02:03.530
<v Speaker 1>runnIng around going off with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>heads off with their heads,</v>

1085
01:02:03.531 --> 01:02:04.364
<v Speaker 1>which is in an arbitrary way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is of course what the red queen </v>

1086
01:02:06.321 --> 01:02:09.030
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at one point she tells alice,</v>

1087
01:02:09.290 --> 01:02:10.400
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a,</v>

1088
01:02:10.830 --> 01:02:15.830
<v Speaker 1>it's such a remarkably deep line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She says to ellis in my kingdom,</v>

1089
01:02:16.461 --> 01:02:19.740
<v Speaker 1>you have to run as fast as you can just </v>
<v Speaker 1>to stay in the same place.</v>

1090
01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:22.213
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can think the environment that </v>

1091
01:02:25.011 --> 01:02:28.490
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to adapt to is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>dynamic content,</v>

1092
01:02:28.550 --> 01:02:31.880
<v Speaker 1>intonation of patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's transforming across time,</v>

1093
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:35.900
<v Speaker 1>not completely unpredictably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly not predictably.</v>

1094
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:40.580
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that if you build a </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure that is adapted to it,</v>

1095
01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:42.133
<v Speaker 1>that structure has to change and flow in</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping with the change and flow of the </v>

1096
01:02:45.771 --> 01:02:49.280
<v Speaker 1>underlying environment or it gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>outdated,</v>

1097
01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:50.173
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets,</v>

1098
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:52.250
<v Speaker 1>what do you call that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obsolescent.</v>

1099
01:02:52.850 --> 01:02:53.683
<v Speaker 1>And so all you have to do Is sit there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and do nothing and you'll become </v>

1100
01:02:55.641 --> 01:02:56.474
<v Speaker 1>obsolescent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's part of the problem with </v>

1101
01:02:58.551 --> 01:03:02.240
<v Speaker 1>those cyrus being old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was good guy when he was young,</v>

1102
01:03:02.241 --> 01:03:03.074
<v Speaker 1>but he's old now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the old solutions don't solve the </v>

1103
01:03:05.631 --> 01:03:06.464
<v Speaker 1>new problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could call that a egyptian </v>

1104
01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:13.640
<v Speaker 1>existential statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of you have a culture.</v>

1105
01:03:14.570 --> 01:03:18.980
<v Speaker 1>It's old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't apply or doesn't apply.</v>

1106
01:03:18.981 --> 01:03:19.814
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what are you going to do with </v>

1107
01:03:20.590 --> 01:03:21.890
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Throw the whole thing out.</v>

1108
01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:23.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know what happens.</v>

1109
01:03:23.530 --> 01:03:26.450
<v Speaker 1>The mesopotamians already told us what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens if you do that.</v>

1110
01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:27.313
<v Speaker 1>It's like thai map comes flooding back </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all hell breaks loose so you can't </v>

1111
01:03:30.501 --> 01:03:33.620
<v Speaker 1>throw everything away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't work very well.</v>

1112
01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:36.590
<v Speaker 1>So it's up to you to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fix it.</v>

1113
01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:39.830
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now.</v>

1114
01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:40.680
<v Speaker 1>But now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh sorry,</v>

1115
01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:43.310
<v Speaker 1>I've got another problem is you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1116
01:03:47.070 --> 01:03:49.740
<v Speaker 1>well let's say you've got an old </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer.</v>

1117
01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:50.603
<v Speaker 1>This by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in case you haven't noticed is a very </v>

1118
01:03:51.991 --> 01:03:52.824
<v Speaker 1>old computer and in a way if you keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>tapping on it and upgrading it a little </v>

1119
01:03:58.201 --> 01:04:00.190
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could keep it more or less uptodate.</v>

1120
01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:02.220
<v Speaker 1>At some point you're going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw the whole damn thing away,</v>

1121
01:04:02.221 --> 01:04:06.360
<v Speaker 1>but you can do incremental changes to it</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a continual basis.</v>

1122
01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:08.730
<v Speaker 1>And the thing will more or less stay </v>
<v Speaker 1>functional.</v>

1123
01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:13.290
<v Speaker 1>You can think about those incremental </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes as partial revolutions,</v>

1124
01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:14.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt?</v>

1125
01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:19.230
<v Speaker 1>Remember that hierarchy now and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to change the operating system.</v>

1126
01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:23.760
<v Speaker 1>That sucks because that means everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath virtually has to change,</v>

1127
01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:27.780
<v Speaker 1>but more more often you're doing a tweak</v>
<v Speaker 1>here and tweak their,</v>

1128
01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:29.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at lower,</v>

1129
01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:33.870
<v Speaker 1>more specific levels and if you tweak </v>
<v Speaker 1>now often the probability that the whole</v>

1130
01:04:33.871 --> 01:04:34.704
<v Speaker 1>thing is going to collapse and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have to do a clean install is </v>

1131
01:04:36.931 --> 01:04:37.764
<v Speaker 1>quite low.</v>

1132
01:04:37.890 --> 01:04:41.250
<v Speaker 1>While the same thing applies to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>state logically enough,</v>

1133
01:04:41.550 --> 01:04:43.620
<v Speaker 1>this is the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1134
01:04:43.621 --> 01:04:45.690
<v Speaker 1>If you think your laptop isn't the </v>
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>

1135
01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:48.480
<v Speaker 1>then you're not thinking about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>laptop properly.</v>

1136
01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:49.493
<v Speaker 1>It's the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when it's going to be more and more </v>

1137
01:04:51.671 --> 01:04:54.330
<v Speaker 1>of the state as we progress over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next 20 years,</v>

1138
01:04:54.331 --> 01:04:57.660
<v Speaker 1>you know so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know that if you're aware and you</v>

1139
01:04:57.661 --> 01:04:59.610
<v Speaker 1>keep the updates happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stay awake,</v>

1140
01:04:59.611 --> 01:05:00.444
<v Speaker 1>that you can keep the thing functioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At some point it's going to get so </v>

1141
01:05:02.821 --> 01:05:04.890
<v Speaker 1>anachronistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better just to replace it,</v>

1142
01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:07.770
<v Speaker 1>which is also by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen to all of you.</v>

1143
01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:11.490
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a decision that evolution it in</v>

1144
01:05:11.491 --> 01:05:15.840
<v Speaker 1>some sense in biology has made that at </v>
<v Speaker 1>some point trying to keep you updated is</v>

1145
01:05:15.841 --> 01:05:20.841
<v Speaker 1>so bloody complicated that you might as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well just get rid of the whole thing and</v>

1146
01:05:21.370 --> 01:05:22.740
<v Speaker 1>let something new occurring.</v>

1147
01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:25.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm really dead serious about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>because depth evolved.</v>

1148
01:05:26.830 --> 01:05:27.663
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have elements in you that are three </v>

1149
01:05:29.021 --> 01:05:33.490
<v Speaker 1>and a half billion years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not everything dies and some,</v>

1150
01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:36.040
<v Speaker 1>some creatures are functionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>immortal,</v>

1151
01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:40.150
<v Speaker 1>so but no at us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is as well,</v>

1152
01:05:40.151 --> 01:05:42.490
<v Speaker 1>at some point we just were too old to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>updated.</v>

1153
01:05:42.491 --> 01:05:47.491
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the end of that seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen over about a 100 year period.</v>

1154
01:05:49.090 --> 01:05:52.030
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do incremental.</v>

1155
01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine you just ignore your </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer completely.</v>

1156
01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:57.310
<v Speaker 1>You don't update the thing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1157
01:05:58.630 --> 01:06:03.250
<v Speaker 1>it's going to get anachronistic of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>own accord.</v>

1158
01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:07.240
<v Speaker 1>But if you refuse to engage in those </v>
<v Speaker 1>operations,</v>

1159
01:06:07.241 --> 01:06:08.074
<v Speaker 1>that would keep it updated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to get anachronistic a lot </v>

1160
01:06:09.971 --> 01:06:12.640
<v Speaker 1>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happens to a cyrus.</v>

1161
01:06:12.670 --> 01:06:13.503
<v Speaker 1>They say the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like he's old and that's part of </v>

1162
01:06:17.711 --> 01:06:20.110
<v Speaker 1>the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's past his prime,</v>

1163
01:06:20.111 --> 01:06:22.810
<v Speaker 1>but the worst part of the problem is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's willfully blind.</v>

1164
01:06:23.830 --> 01:06:27.550
<v Speaker 1>He won't take action even though he </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows it's necessary,</v>

1165
01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:32.110
<v Speaker 1>and so he gets out of date and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological,</v>

1166
01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:32.973
<v Speaker 1>faster than necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know when you hear in the flood </v>

1167
01:06:36.011 --> 01:06:39.280
<v Speaker 1>stories that god is angry about the sins</v>
<v Speaker 1>of men,</v>

1168
01:06:39.281 --> 01:06:40.960
<v Speaker 1>and that's why he washes everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

1169
01:06:40.961 --> 01:06:42.190
<v Speaker 1>It's the same idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1170
01:06:42.191 --> 01:06:43.024
<v Speaker 1>the word sin comes from the greek word </v>
<v Speaker 1>hamartia and hamartia is an archery </v>

1171
01:06:48.431 --> 01:06:49.264
<v Speaker 1>term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to sin means not to hit the center </v>

1172
01:06:51.761 --> 01:06:52.594
<v Speaker 1>of the target.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so basically the idea in the flood </v>

1173
01:06:56.141 --> 01:06:56.974
<v Speaker 1>of stories is that if enough people </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't aiming at the target or hitting </v>

1174
01:07:00.641 --> 01:07:03.520
<v Speaker 1>the center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then things are gonna get so corrupted,</v>

1175
01:07:03.521 --> 01:07:04.354
<v Speaker 1>unstable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that everything is going to get washed </v>

1176
01:07:05.861 --> 01:07:07.270
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's right.</v>

1177
01:07:07.271 --> 01:07:11.410
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly perfectly accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1178
01:07:11.411 --> 01:07:12.580
<v Speaker 1>which is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very cool.</v>

1179
01:07:12.730 --> 01:07:14.770
<v Speaker 1>It's very remarkable that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>

1180
01:07:14.771 --> 01:07:16.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now cyrus,</v>

1181
01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:19.750
<v Speaker 1>because this is a myth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has an evil brother.</v>

1182
01:07:20.830 --> 01:07:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Now that's pretty common occurrence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the lion king,</v>

1183
01:07:23.501 --> 01:07:26.110
<v Speaker 1>which is very much the egyptian creation</v>
<v Speaker 1>myth,</v>

1184
01:07:26.111 --> 01:07:27.760
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lion king,</v>

1185
01:07:27.761 --> 01:07:28.800
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1186
01:07:29.050 --> 01:07:33.820
<v Speaker 1>what's the old guy's name now will blind</v>
<v Speaker 1>you remember</v>

1187
01:07:36.490 --> 01:07:37.510
<v Speaker 1>he has a brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1188
01:07:37.511 --> 01:07:41.320
<v Speaker 1>What's his brother scar?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's the problem with scar?</v>

1189
01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:44.290
<v Speaker 1>He's scarred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1190
01:07:44.291 --> 01:07:44.801
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1191
01:07:44.801 --> 01:07:45.990
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's had,</v>

1192
01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:47.130
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says he's,</v>

1193
01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:50.530
<v Speaker 1>he's from the bottom of the gene pool </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1194
01:07:50.531 --> 01:07:53.620
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been in second place all his life,</v>

1195
01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:55.900
<v Speaker 1>but that's not any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andy's very,</v>

1196
01:07:55.901 --> 01:07:58.450
<v Speaker 1>very intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He worships his own intelligence.</v>

1197
01:07:58.451 --> 01:08:00.730
<v Speaker 1>He regards himself as a higher form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellect,</v>

1198
01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:04.990
<v Speaker 1>which is very common characteristic of </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil brothers in mythology.</v>

1199
01:08:04.991 --> 01:08:05.824
<v Speaker 1>And there's a reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's scarred because life has </v>

1200
01:08:09.401 --> 01:08:13.030
<v Speaker 1>scarred him and he's bitter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful and he wants to bring down the</v>

1201
01:08:13.031 --> 01:08:15.260
<v Speaker 1>order and he wants to kill the son of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the king.</v>

1202
01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:16.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a bad guy.</v>

1203
01:08:18.290 --> 01:08:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that mufasa underestimates,</v>

1204
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:26.470
<v Speaker 1>and that's exactly what happens to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus cyrus has this brother sat or seth</v>

1205
01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:28.753
<v Speaker 1>and I have a sneaking suspicion that r </v>
<v Speaker 1>word set for setting sun is from that </v>

1206
01:08:32.451 --> 01:08:34.520
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I don't know that for sure,</v>

1207
01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:37.970
<v Speaker 1>but sounds or are generally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1208
01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:39.773
<v Speaker 1>sounds language remains stable across a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very long period of time and set was </v>

1209
01:08:42.981 --> 01:08:45.470
<v Speaker 1>definitely from the egyptian </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

1210
01:08:45.710 --> 01:08:50.710
<v Speaker 1>the enemy of the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's part of the egyptian cosmology</v>

1211
01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:52.453
<v Speaker 1>and the sun is associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>illumination and brightness and daytime </v>

1212
01:08:55.521 --> 01:08:58.730
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and clear apprehension and</v>
<v Speaker 1>vision and all of those things.</v>

1213
01:08:58.731 --> 01:08:59.564
<v Speaker 1>And of course the night is opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that unconsciousness and blindness and </v>

1214
01:09:02.931 --> 01:09:05.300
<v Speaker 1>danger and all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1215
01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:06.860
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seth,</v>

1216
01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:08.430
<v Speaker 1>he's pretending to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1217
01:09:08.431 --> 01:09:10.790
<v Speaker 1>cyrus's loving brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's not.</v>

1218
01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:14.960
<v Speaker 1>He's plotting to overthrow the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance she gets.</v>

1219
01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:18.350
<v Speaker 1>And so he's just sitting in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>background feeding him bad advice,</v>

1220
01:09:18.410 --> 01:09:21.860
<v Speaker 1>waiting for waiting for him to get weak </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough so that he can strike.</v>

1221
01:09:22.250 --> 01:09:27.250
<v Speaker 1>Now the name Set is taken by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>egyptian coptics and turned into satan.</v>

1222
01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:31.430
<v Speaker 1>So sap is the precursor of the christian</v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

1223
01:09:31.790 --> 01:09:32.623
<v Speaker 1>So you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason I'm telling you that is so </v>

1224
01:09:34.011 --> 01:09:39.011
<v Speaker 1>that you can see how these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these archetypal ideas of corruption and</v>

1225
01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:40.363
<v Speaker 1>evil are are extraordinarily ancient and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're part of the process whereby </v>

1226
01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:47.053
<v Speaker 1>people are trying to figure out what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right way is to act and what the wrong </v>

1227
01:09:50.121 --> 01:09:50.954
<v Speaker 1>way is to act and what the right way is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to set up institutions and what the </v>

1228
01:09:53.721 --> 01:09:57.680
<v Speaker 1>wrong way is to set up institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very,</v>

1229
01:09:57.681 --> 01:10:01.730
<v Speaker 1>very long process and it's not something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that someone just sat around and thought</v>

1230
01:10:01.731 --> 01:10:02.660
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way,</v>

1231
01:10:02.661 --> 01:10:03.770
<v Speaker 1>way deeper than that.</v>

1232
01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:07.450
<v Speaker 1>So anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1233
01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:09.310
<v Speaker 1>cyrus is being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1234
01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:11.450
<v Speaker 1>getting weaker and being blind in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

1235
01:10:11.451 --> 01:10:12.081
<v Speaker 1>Seth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks.</v>

1236
01:10:12.081 --> 01:10:14.390
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Time for action.</v>

1237
01:10:14.391 --> 01:10:17.360
<v Speaker 1>So he takes his brother and he chops it </v>
<v Speaker 1>up into little pieces.</v>

1238
01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:22.730
<v Speaker 1>Now cyrus is a god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're not going to kill them,</v>

1239
01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:25.730
<v Speaker 1>but you can make it very difficult for </v>
<v Speaker 1>him to get his act together.</v>

1240
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically what happens is,</v>

1241
01:10:27.831 --> 01:10:29.570
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cyrus falls apart.</v>

1242
01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:33.740
<v Speaker 1>Now think aBout that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fall apart.</v>

1243
01:10:34.850 --> 01:10:37.760
<v Speaker 1>People say that the relatIonship fell </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

1244
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:40.310
<v Speaker 1>It fell apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things fall apart.</v>

1245
01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:42.800
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1246
01:10:42.801 --> 01:10:43.634
<v Speaker 1>it means that a thing is usually a </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex unity of multiple sub entities </v>

1247
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:50.263
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes what holds them together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the superordinate structure collapses </v>

1248
01:10:54.410 --> 01:10:58.640
<v Speaker 1>and all that's left are the things you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know because like when you fall apart,</v>

1249
01:10:59.570 --> 01:11:01.870
<v Speaker 1>you don't completely fall apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1250
01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:02.733
<v Speaker 1>you're still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's happened is that the unity of </v>

1251
01:11:05.301 --> 01:11:06.134
<v Speaker 1>your psychological structure as being </v>
<v Speaker 1>fragmented and that's a trip to the </v>

1252
01:11:08.961 --> 01:11:09.830
<v Speaker 1>underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1253
01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:11.053
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to be unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I broke up with my partner and then I </v>

1254
01:11:14.431 --> 01:11:16.890
<v Speaker 1>fell apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While everyone knows what that means.</v>

1255
01:11:17.130 --> 01:11:18.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what happened to cyrus.</v>

1256
01:11:20.130 --> 01:11:21.830
<v Speaker 1>Things fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1257
01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:22.893
<v Speaker 1>so then seth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a sneaky sort of character takes </v>

1258
01:11:26.251 --> 01:11:29.160
<v Speaker 1>all of those cyrus's pieces and he puts </v>
<v Speaker 1>them all over Egypt.</v>

1259
01:11:29.161 --> 01:11:29.994
<v Speaker 1>He hides them in here and there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was cyrus is gonna have a hell </v>

1260
01:11:33.301 --> 01:11:34.134
<v Speaker 1>of a time recollecting himself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting his act together and coming </v>

1261
01:11:37.501 --> 01:11:40.860
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so things fall apart.</v>

1262
01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.070
<v Speaker 1>Now the same thing happens in the lion </v>
<v Speaker 1>king,</v>

1263
01:11:44.071 --> 01:11:46.880
<v Speaker 1>obviously because scar kills us.</v>

1264
01:11:47.610 --> 01:11:48.443
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1265
01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:55.010
<v Speaker 1>so fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The insets rules,</v>

1266
01:11:55.130 --> 01:11:55.963
<v Speaker 1>that's not a good day for the egyptians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember what happens in the lion </v>

1267
01:11:58.881 --> 01:11:59.714
<v Speaker 1>king when scar rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment becomes completely </v>

1268
01:12:03.411 --> 01:12:05.810
<v Speaker 1>devastated because they overhand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1269
01:12:05.811 --> 01:12:08.150
<v Speaker 1>So you get total environmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>devastation.</v>

1270
01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:09.323
<v Speaker 1>It's all black and burnt and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing is functioning properly and </v>

1271
01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:17.120
<v Speaker 1>remember after sin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but comes back to set things right?</v>

1272
01:12:17.121 --> 01:12:19.150
<v Speaker 1>It starts to rain and everything comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

1273
01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:21.170
<v Speaker 1>It comes back to life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1274
01:12:21.171 --> 01:12:22.004
<v Speaker 1>it's another indication of the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really can't separate the </v>

1275
01:12:25.041 --> 01:12:26.900
<v Speaker 1>environment from the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1276
01:12:27.130 --> 01:12:27.963
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1277
01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:31.760
<v Speaker 1>they're in a dynamic system of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction anyways.</v>

1278
01:12:31.810 --> 01:12:32.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cyrus,</v>

1279
01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:35.260
<v Speaker 1>things have fallen apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1280
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:37.580
<v Speaker 1>cyrus has a wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has to.</v>

1281
01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:40.830
<v Speaker 1>He's king of order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While we're missing someone,</v>

1282
01:12:40.831 --> 01:12:41.664
<v Speaker 1>we're missing the queen of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're missing the queen of the </v>

1283
01:12:43.491 --> 01:12:44.960
<v Speaker 1>underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's isis.</v>

1284
01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:47.750
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isis was a long lasting goddess.</v>

1285
01:12:47.751 --> 01:12:52.310
<v Speaker 1>There's been goddess religions forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an idea among</v>

1286
01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:56.053
<v Speaker 1>misinformed feminist anthropologists </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the original religious structures </v>

1287
01:13:00.471 --> 01:13:04.100
<v Speaker 1>were feminine earth goddess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tight religions,</v>

1288
01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:05.113
<v Speaker 1>and then they were replaced by </v>
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal religious and there's no </v>

1289
01:13:08.391 --> 01:13:09.224
<v Speaker 1>historical evidence for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the basket work I know on that is </v>

1290
01:13:13.071 --> 01:13:16.700
<v Speaker 1>actually through the unions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm young and Eric Norman,</v>

1291
01:13:16.730 --> 01:13:17.563
<v Speaker 1>because what they figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were kind of on the same track </v>

1292
01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:23.690
<v Speaker 1>thinking about the same idea that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed to be a shift between matriarchal</v>

1293
01:13:23.691 --> 01:13:27.200
<v Speaker 1>values to patriarchal values and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a historical shift,</v>

1294
01:13:27.201 --> 01:13:31.910
<v Speaker 1>but what they found Instead was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually a mythological idea.</v>

1295
01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:36.470
<v Speaker 1>It's not a historical reality and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful as a mythological idea,</v>

1296
01:13:36.471 --> 01:13:37.304
<v Speaker 1>but you shouldn't project it backwards </v>
<v Speaker 1>onto time and make it a historical </v>

1297
01:13:39.891 --> 01:13:41.810
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1298
01:13:42.650 --> 01:13:43.483
<v Speaker 1>isis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's been queen of the underworld </v>

1299
01:13:45.021 --> 01:13:45.980
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1300
01:13:45.981 --> 01:13:48.320
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when order collapses,</v>

1301
01:13:48.530 --> 01:13:50.450
<v Speaker 1>chaos reappears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what happens.</v>

1302
01:13:50.451 --> 01:13:55.190
<v Speaker 1>isis pops up out of the underworld and </v>
<v Speaker 1>her husband's missing and she's not very</v>

1303
01:13:55.191 --> 01:13:56.024
<v Speaker 1>happy about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she wanders all over Egypt looking </v>

1304
01:13:58.881 --> 01:13:59.714
<v Speaker 1>for his fellas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now that's an interesting idea </v>

1305
01:14:04.130 --> 01:14:04.963
<v Speaker 1>because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it touches on like the biology of </v>

1306
01:14:10.370 --> 01:14:11.203
<v Speaker 1>innovation in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've heard of the notion of a </v>

1307
01:14:14.021 --> 01:14:16.270
<v Speaker 1>seminal idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1308
01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:17.313
<v Speaker 1>that's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a mythologically informed </v>

1309
01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:21.093
<v Speaker 1>metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea is that in biological </v>

1310
01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:29.730
<v Speaker 1>biological reproduction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>semen falls on fertile ground and out of</v>

1311
01:14:30.011 --> 01:14:31.480
<v Speaker 1>that something emerges.</v>

1312
01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:32.893
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1313
01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:37.293
<v Speaker 1>there's a tight analog between that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens in the egyptian myth with </v>

1314
01:14:41.141 --> 01:14:41.974
<v Speaker 1>regards to sexuality now young and freud</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a big argument about this because </v>

1315
01:14:45.821 --> 01:14:46.654
<v Speaker 1>freud thought you could reduce </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything to sexuality and freud and </v>

1316
01:14:50.290 --> 01:14:52.420
<v Speaker 1>freud said that and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1317
01:14:52.421 --> 01:14:53.254
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you don't understand Is that </v>

1318
01:14:54.251 --> 01:14:55.084
<v Speaker 1>sexuality itself is often used as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbol for something even more profound </v>

1319
01:14:59.770 --> 01:15:02.410
<v Speaker 1>and they didn't agree on that and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the way they went.</v>

1320
01:15:02.411 --> 01:15:03.244
<v Speaker 1>Their separate ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You freud was very much unwilling to </v>

1321
01:15:05.981 --> 01:15:10.981
<v Speaker 1>believe that religion could be anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>other than a like a set of defensive and</v>

1322
01:15:12.401 --> 01:15:13.234
<v Speaker 1>repressive beliefs and practices </v>
<v Speaker 1>designed to protect you from death </v>

1323
01:15:17.381 --> 01:15:20.920
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was basically his hypothesis and</v>

1324
01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:25.630
<v Speaker 1>and it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

1325
01:15:25.690 --> 01:15:26.523
<v Speaker 1>I mean there is that element of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can use dogs to protect </v>

1326
01:15:29.231 --> 01:15:31.570
<v Speaker 1>yourself against all sorts of things you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to think about,</v>

1327
01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:34.660
<v Speaker 1>but you can't reduce the whole damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing too.</v>

1328
01:15:34.661 --> 01:15:35.494
<v Speaker 1>That you want to watch people of any </v>
<v Speaker 1>type that are intellectuals who will </v>

1329
01:15:40.991 --> 01:15:44.590
<v Speaker 1>tell you that everything can be reduced </v>
<v Speaker 1>to one cause.</v>

1330
01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:46.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a misplaced monotheism.</v>

1331
01:15:48.030 --> 01:15:48.863
<v Speaker 1>Lots of people do that for marx,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's economics or class warfare for </v>

1332
01:15:51.911 --> 01:15:53.050
<v Speaker 1>freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sexuality,</v>

1333
01:15:53.051 --> 01:15:56.380
<v Speaker 1>although he also considers aggression </v>
<v Speaker 1>for foodco its power,</v>

1334
01:15:56.650 --> 01:15:57.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1335
01:15:57.251 --> 01:15:59.560
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that simple.</v>

1336
01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:00.873
<v Speaker 1>You can make a good story out of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations because they're powerful </v>

1337
01:16:03.221 --> 01:16:05.020
<v Speaker 1>motivations and they do affect </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

1338
01:16:05.021 --> 01:16:06.700
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean they cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1339
01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:08.950
<v Speaker 1>Unit dementia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1340
01:16:08.951 --> 01:16:10.630
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isis pops up.</v>

1341
01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Can we?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The underworld,</v>

1342
01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:15.550
<v Speaker 1>seth takes control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chaos emerges from the underworld.</v>

1343
01:16:15.970 --> 01:16:19.750
<v Speaker 1>isis wonders around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She finds it was cyrus says,</v>

1344
01:16:19.751 --> 01:16:21.700
<v Speaker 1>fellas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she makes herself pregnant.</v>

1345
01:16:22.690 --> 01:16:23.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what does that mean?</v>

1346
01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means a lot of things.</v>

1347
01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:29.470
<v Speaker 1>One thing it means is that if a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>system falls apart,</v>

1348
01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:34.510
<v Speaker 1>the parts still have life and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think about that.</v>

1349
01:16:34.511 --> 01:16:38.740
<v Speaker 1>People often talk about the stability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the degree that it's stable.</v>

1350
01:16:39.010 --> 01:16:44.010
<v Speaker 1>part of the stability of capitalism is </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's creative destruction,</v>

1351
01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:49.360
<v Speaker 1>is that capitalism allows great </v>
<v Speaker 1>enterprises to collapse and disperse,</v>

1352
01:16:51.130 --> 01:16:54.100
<v Speaker 1>but they don't break down into subatomic</v>
<v Speaker 1>particles,</v>

1353
01:16:54.101 --> 01:16:55.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They collapsed,</v>

1354
01:16:55.091 --> 01:16:58.120
<v Speaker 1>but the pieces they collapse into still </v>
<v Speaker 1>has have life.</v>

1355
01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:01.210
<v Speaker 1>Some of them more than others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if something collapses,</v>

1356
01:17:01.211 --> 01:17:02.044
<v Speaker 1>sometimes part of the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapsed has enough life to build </v>

1357
01:17:05.321 --> 01:17:06.154
<v Speaker 1>something new out of the pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the same thing that happens to </v>

1358
01:17:09.261 --> 01:17:10.094
<v Speaker 1>you when you go through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>undergo a radical revolutionary </v>

1359
01:17:13.041 --> 01:17:14.690
<v Speaker 1>transformation in your character.</v>

1360
01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:15.943
<v Speaker 1>You know you might even feel like you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>dying and in some sense the organizing </v>

1361
01:17:21.231 --> 01:17:24.920
<v Speaker 1>principles by which you lived are dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's taking you out.</v>

1362
01:17:24.921 --> 01:17:26.300
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's painful.</v>

1363
01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:28.820
<v Speaker 1>You know those things are alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no,</v>

1364
01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:32.150
<v Speaker 1>no trivial matter that can be taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

1365
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:35.810
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hope that you get taken apart.</v>

1366
01:17:35.811 --> 01:17:38.930
<v Speaker 1>You can find some new information down </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and the chaos,</v>

1367
01:17:38.931 --> 01:17:39.764
<v Speaker 1>and that's your union with isis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking and out of that union </v>

1368
01:17:43.941 --> 01:17:48.110
<v Speaker 1>of information from the chaos and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of you that are left,</v>

1369
01:17:48.111 --> 01:17:50.540
<v Speaker 1>you can come springing back and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1370
01:17:50.541 --> 01:17:53.150
<v Speaker 1>everyone hopes that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And often it's the case.</v>

1371
01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:54.693
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the lessons you can derive from </v>

1372
01:17:56.151 --> 01:18:01.010
<v Speaker 1>Egypt and mythology is bloody well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay awake and make the corrections when</v>

1373
01:18:01.011 --> 01:18:01.844
<v Speaker 1>you need to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't be willfully blind because if </v>

1374
01:18:03.711 --> 01:18:05.130
<v Speaker 1>you're willfully blind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to,</v>

1375
01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:08.390
<v Speaker 1>you're going to store up chaos because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

1376
01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:09.413
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping at bay and then one day when </v>

1377
01:18:11.211 --> 01:18:13.340
<v Speaker 1>you're weak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just going to take you out.</v>

1378
01:18:13.850 --> 01:18:16.250
<v Speaker 1>And that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happens to people all the time.</v>

1379
01:18:16.570 --> 01:18:17.403
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1380
01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:18.433
<v Speaker 1>they let things around them degenerate </v>
<v Speaker 1>back into chaos and then one day their </v>

1381
01:18:23.871 --> 01:18:26.900
<v Speaker 1>week and something else comes along to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit them and they're done.</v>

1382
01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:28.700
<v Speaker 1>They can't get up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too heavy,</v>

1383
01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:29.713
<v Speaker 1>it's too hard to hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then they're down in the </v>

1384
01:18:31.311 --> 01:18:32.144
<v Speaker 1>underworld and they stay there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the general rule is if you're going </v>

1385
01:18:37.221 --> 01:18:38.054
<v Speaker 1>to go to the underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better to go on purpose and for </v>

1386
01:18:39.891 --> 01:18:40.724
<v Speaker 1>short voyages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the idea behind voluntary </v>

1387
01:18:43.641 --> 01:18:44.780
<v Speaker 1>exposure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1388
01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:46.243
<v Speaker 1>Find out what you don't want to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easy enough to do that because </v>

1389
01:18:49.491 --> 01:18:50.900
<v Speaker 1>you're going to see yourself avoiding </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1390
01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:54.290
<v Speaker 1>Then figure out how you can approach it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in an order.</v>

1391
01:18:54.291 --> 01:18:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Some of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1392
01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:59.630
<v Speaker 1>in this big chunks as you can manage and</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that all the time,</v>

1393
01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:00.883
<v Speaker 1>stay awake because then you keep your </v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure properly maintained and </v>

1394
01:19:05.811 --> 01:19:09.800
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you'll be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerate a powerful blow is much,</v>

1395
01:19:09.801 --> 01:19:10.550
<v Speaker 1>much higher.</v>

1396
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:13.220
<v Speaker 1>It's not certain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing about myths.</v>

1397
01:19:13.221 --> 01:19:14.054
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tell you the best way to negotiate </v>

1398
01:19:16.221 --> 01:19:17.054
<v Speaker 1>through life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they never tell you that that will </v>

1399
01:19:19.131 --> 01:19:22.220
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just tell you that that's your best</v>

1400
01:19:22.230 --> 01:19:23.720
<v Speaker 1>bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1401
01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:25.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's not.</v>

1402
01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:28.460
<v Speaker 1>It might be enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1403
01:19:28.461 --> 01:19:30.890
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isis finds,</v>

1404
01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:31.773
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cyrus's fellas and gets pregnant and </v>

1405
01:19:34.581 --> 01:19:35.414
<v Speaker 1>then back to the underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes and she goes through her </v>

1406
01:19:38.301 --> 01:19:41.600
<v Speaker 1>pregnancy and she gives birth to horace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a pretty common story,</v>

1407
01:19:41.601 --> 01:19:44.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the long lost.</v>

1408
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:47.600
<v Speaker 1>Rightful king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>King arthur,</v>

1409
01:19:47.601 --> 01:19:48.434
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arthur asked to be taken away from the </v>

1410
01:19:50.421 --> 01:19:53.060
<v Speaker 1>castle to be raised basically in </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolation.</v>

1411
01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:54.860
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very common story.</v>

1412
01:19:55.250 --> 01:19:57.920
<v Speaker 1>And the reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing happens to Harry Potter,</v>

1413
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:58.783
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harry potter is stuck with these </v>

1414
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:01.840
<v Speaker 1>dursleys and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>

1415
01:20:03.710 --> 01:20:08.460
<v Speaker 1>they're like every resentful child's </v>
<v Speaker 1>image of their parents,</v>

1416
01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:09.863
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe it's more like every resentful </v>

1417
01:20:11.851 --> 01:20:14.790
<v Speaker 1>13 year olds image of their parents and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1418
01:20:14.791 --> 01:20:17.930
<v Speaker 1>the truth of the matter is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you are a current stock off in a</v>

1419
01:20:20.130 --> 01:20:23.130
<v Speaker 1>normative wastelands of your culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1420
01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:25.140
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have your specific parents.</v>

1421
01:20:25.141 --> 01:20:29.290
<v Speaker 1>They're not archetipal representatives </v>
<v Speaker 1>of reality there.</v>

1422
01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:32.340
<v Speaker 1>They're your parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their nature and culture,</v>

1423
01:20:32.341 --> 01:20:35.820
<v Speaker 1>but in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in finite and flawed human form.</v>

1424
01:20:36.210 --> 01:20:37.043
<v Speaker 1>And what that means in part is you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>raised outside the domain of your </v>

1425
01:20:42.571 --> 01:20:43.830
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's old.</v>

1426
01:20:43.831 --> 01:20:47.640
<v Speaker 1>It isn't working very well and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>transmitted very well to you.</v>

1427
01:20:48.150 --> 01:20:50.550
<v Speaker 1>So you grew up outside of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're alienated from it.</v>

1428
01:20:51.130 --> 01:20:54.090
<v Speaker 1>That's that existentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people always felt</v>

1429
01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:56.433
<v Speaker 1>existential alienation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have always felt alienated from </v>

1430
01:20:59.141 --> 01:21:04.141
<v Speaker 1>their damn culture because it's old and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of blind and there you are,</v>

1431
01:21:04.990 --> 01:21:08.620
<v Speaker 1>young and dynamic and full of life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all it's doing is telling you you can do</v>

1432
01:21:08.621 --> 01:21:10.780
<v Speaker 1>this and you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1433
01:21:10.781 --> 01:21:14.230
<v Speaker 1>lying to you about some things and doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it pretty nasty job of others.</v>

1434
01:21:14.231 --> 01:21:17.290
<v Speaker 1>And so your own side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when you're alienated from it.</v>

1435
01:21:17.291 --> 01:21:20.230
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happens to horace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's outside in not world.</v>

1436
01:21:20.231 --> 01:21:23.680
<v Speaker 1>That's where he gets bored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's where thinking about too.</v>

1437
01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:26.650
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he grows up.</v>

1438
01:21:27.190 --> 01:21:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Now horace is an interesting sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

1439
01:21:29.950 --> 01:21:32.950
<v Speaker 1>So you've all seen the image of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>egyptian.</v>

1440
01:21:32.951 --> 01:21:35.500
<v Speaker 1>I right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows that image even now,</v>

1441
01:21:35.501 --> 01:21:37.230
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's got a,</v>

1442
01:21:37.690 --> 01:21:38.523
<v Speaker 1>an eyebrow and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got an eye in the middle and then </v>

1443
01:21:40.091 --> 01:21:40.924
<v Speaker 1>it's got the iris and usually the pupil </v>
<v Speaker 1>is so big that it covers the whole iris </v>

1444
01:21:45.550 --> 01:21:47.230
<v Speaker 1>and there's a variety of reasons for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1445
01:21:47.230 --> 01:21:51.250
<v Speaker 1>But one of the reasons is is that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolize interest and attention.</v>

1446
01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:54.100
<v Speaker 1>So when you're interested in something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your pupil grows.</v>

1447
01:21:54.370 --> 01:21:55.203
<v Speaker 1>And so horace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his pupil is really big and he's </v>

1448
01:21:56.771 --> 01:21:57.604
<v Speaker 1>checking things out like matt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So horace is the eye and he's aLso a </v>

1449
01:22:01.010 --> 01:22:03.190
<v Speaker 1>falcon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

1450
01:22:03.191 --> 01:22:04.024
<v Speaker 1>well why is he a falcon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is falcons are </v>

1451
01:22:06.581 --> 01:22:07.414
<v Speaker 1>birds of prey and they can really see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another amplification of the </v>

1452
01:22:12.791 --> 01:22:14.890
<v Speaker 1>idea of the art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1453
01:22:14.891 --> 01:22:19.810
<v Speaker 1>falcons fly up above everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even above the pyramids and they can see</v>

1454
01:22:19.811 --> 01:22:22.720
<v Speaker 1>wherever they want to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so horace is the thing.</v>

1455
01:22:22.721 --> 01:22:23.554
<v Speaker 1>That's why he's up above the structures </v>
<v Speaker 1>of mankind in some sense and can see </v>

1456
01:22:27.431 --> 01:22:28.264
<v Speaker 1>them panoramic lee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's not encapsulated in any </v>

1457
01:22:31.361 --> 01:22:34.660
<v Speaker 1>particular pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the thing that's above all pyramids</v>

1458
01:22:34.661 --> 01:22:37.780
<v Speaker 1>and looking and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and providing you with an overview.</v>

1459
01:22:38.530 --> 01:22:39.363
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and I think the best way to </v>

1460
01:22:40.991 --> 01:22:44.680
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize horse in modern terms is </v>
<v Speaker 1>his attention.</v>

1461
01:22:45.610 --> 01:22:49.090
<v Speaker 1>That's not thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole different thing.</v>

1462
01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:54.510
<v Speaker 1>I get tension is what thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Attention is the precursor to thought in</v>

1463
01:22:55.151 --> 01:22:58.630
<v Speaker 1>a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention is where you meet meaning.</v>

1464
01:22:58.660 --> 01:23:00.590
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1465
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:01.833
<v Speaker 1>attention is actually where you take </v>
<v Speaker 1>undifferentiated and start to turn it </v>

1466
01:23:06.431 --> 01:23:07.264
<v Speaker 1>into order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do you think about how much do you </v>

1467
01:23:08.831 --> 01:23:12.070
<v Speaker 1>like being paid attention to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People love that.</v>

1468
01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Children like you don't pay attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they become pathological.</v>

1469
01:23:15.821 --> 01:23:18.460
<v Speaker 1>You don't pay attention to your partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your relationship dissolves.</v>

1470
01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:21.700
<v Speaker 1>No one pays attention to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You crawl off in a corner and die.</v>

1471
01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:26.050
<v Speaker 1>Advertisers pay for your attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like attention.</v>

1472
01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:28.030
<v Speaker 1>That's a currency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's value,</v>

1473
01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:29.553
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you like to be paid attention to </v>

1474
01:23:33.061 --> 01:23:34.390
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you do good things,</v>

1475
01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:37.330
<v Speaker 1>maybe you'll even do terrible things so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that someone pays attention to you.</v>

1476
01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Attention is a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't understand it very well,</v>

1477
01:23:40.630 --> 01:23:41.463
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the egyptians conceptualized it as </v>

1478
01:23:44.231 --> 01:23:46.270
<v Speaker 1>a god not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's smart.</v>

1479
01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:48.670
<v Speaker 1>That's a very smart idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

1480
01:23:48.671 --> 01:23:51.630
<v Speaker 1>horace grows up in the underworld and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>

1481
01:23:51.690 --> 01:23:55.450
<v Speaker 1>when he gets kind of big and ready to </v>
<v Speaker 1>contend with the world,</v>

1482
01:23:55.451 --> 01:23:58.510
<v Speaker 1>he thinks I'm going to take the damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>state back for my eval.</v>

1483
01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:02.260
<v Speaker 1>Uncle were all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're supposed to do.</v>

1484
01:24:03.010 --> 01:24:05.500
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to grow up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay attention,</v>

1485
01:24:05.530 --> 01:24:07.510
<v Speaker 1>get yourself the hell out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>underworld,</v>

1486
01:24:07.690 --> 01:24:11.410
<v Speaker 1>and then take your state back from your </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil uncle.</v>

1487
01:24:11.950 --> 01:24:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what happened?</v>

1488
01:24:13.131 --> 01:24:15.310
<v Speaker 1>So horse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets himself all prepared and he's,</v>

1489
01:24:15.311 --> 01:24:17.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a son of order and chaos,</v>

1490
01:24:17.771 --> 01:24:20.710
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's no second grade character.</v>

1491
01:24:22.510 --> 01:24:25.480
<v Speaker 1>You remember how many of you have seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>the avengers movies?</v>

1492
01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1493
01:24:27.671 --> 01:24:32.170
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's Samuel Jackson right now.</v>

1494
01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:36.610
<v Speaker 1>Samuel jackson is often in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>background and if I remember correctly,</v>

1495
01:24:36.611 --> 01:24:40.840
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of like the mediator between </v>
<v Speaker 1>these shadowy figures that sort of exist</v>

1496
01:24:40.841 --> 01:24:41.790
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1497
01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:44.140
<v Speaker 1>They look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all look like middle aged white men</v>

1498
01:24:44.141 --> 01:24:48.520
<v Speaker 1>and they're sort of like a power group </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they communicate on screen.</v>

1499
01:24:48.521 --> 01:24:53.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly who they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm jackson plays an intermediary,</v>

1500
01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:53.973
<v Speaker 1>but he is lacking and I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason you infer that </v>

1501
01:24:57.521 --> 01:24:58.354
<v Speaker 1>jackson is locking in eyes because he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>at a pretty long history of being </v>

1502
01:25:02.171 --> 01:25:04.800
<v Speaker 1>involved in catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1503
01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:08.110
<v Speaker 1>one consequence of that is that he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>become damaged.</v>

1504
01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:10.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing happens to horace.</v>

1505
01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:15.250
<v Speaker 1>So horace goes back and he says to seth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see you for who you are.</v>

1506
01:25:16.210 --> 01:25:19.030
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're up to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're working for destruction.</v>

1507
01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:20.013
<v Speaker 1>You want to take the state apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing positive about what </v>

1508
01:25:22.541 --> 01:25:23.110
<v Speaker 1>you're doing.</v>

1509
01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:27.280
<v Speaker 1>You facilitate deception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm taking the state max so they have</v>

1510
01:25:27.281 --> 01:25:30.970
<v Speaker 1>a big fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>and during the fight,</v>

1511
01:25:30.971 --> 01:25:35.290
<v Speaker 1>seth terrorists out one of horses eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that'S we're thinking about too,</v>

1512
01:25:35.291 --> 01:25:37.720
<v Speaker 1>because what It means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is exactly right,</v>

1513
01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:38.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things young set about </v>

1514
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:40.833
<v Speaker 1>encountering malevolence is like let's </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that you wanted to understand what </v>

1515
01:25:46.751 --> 01:25:50.740
<v Speaker 1>the nazis did and so you started to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>it apart,</v>

1516
01:25:50.770 --> 01:25:51.603
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at each little bit of exploration </v>

1517
01:25:53.711 --> 01:25:57.070
<v Speaker 1>you take it apart a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply and then a little bit more deeply</v>

1518
01:25:57.071 --> 01:25:59.740
<v Speaker 1>and then a little bit more deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to get to the bottom of it.</v>

1519
01:26:00.250 --> 01:26:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might ask yourself,</v>

1520
01:26:01.631 --> 01:26:04.160
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's at the bottom terrible things?</v>

1521
01:26:04.580 --> 01:26:07.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that and answer to that is</v>

1522
01:26:07.101 --> 01:26:07.934
<v Speaker 1>the archetype of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you are to the degree that you </v>

1523
01:26:12.471 --> 01:26:17.471
<v Speaker 1>encountered that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're capable of god,</v>

1524
01:26:17.730 --> 01:26:20.380
<v Speaker 1>like attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the case of horace,</v>

1525
01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:21.733
<v Speaker 1>the probability is that that will be so </v>
<v Speaker 1>devastating and it will destroy half </v>

1526
01:26:26.391 --> 01:26:27.380
<v Speaker 1>your consciousness.</v>

1527
01:26:27.770 --> 01:26:28.603
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens to horace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so like that's another thing I </v>

1528
01:26:30.831 --> 01:26:31.664
<v Speaker 1>really like about the myths man there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't mess around like you're </v>

1529
01:26:34.191 --> 01:26:35.024
<v Speaker 1>supposed to come out of the underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to see what the hell is </v>

1530
01:26:37.131 --> 01:26:37.964
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to go back and take the </v>

1531
01:26:39.051 --> 01:26:39.884
<v Speaker 1>state away from archaic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's archaic institutions and willful </v>

1532
01:26:43.281 --> 01:26:46.370
<v Speaker 1>blindness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you really contend with that,</v>

1533
01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:47.473
<v Speaker 1>you better look out because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>contending with something that you can </v>

1534
01:26:51.591 --> 01:26:53.840
<v Speaker 1>barely master.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

1535
01:26:53.841 --> 01:26:54.674
<v Speaker 1>horse eat seth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that he has is I tore </v>

1536
01:26:58.640 --> 01:26:59.473
<v Speaker 1>an elk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then he tells seth to go outside </v>

1537
01:27:01.581 --> 01:27:04.160
<v Speaker 1>the boundaries of the kingdom and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>never come back.</v>

1538
01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why doesn't he kill him?</v>

1539
01:27:07.690 --> 01:27:08.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't.</v>

1540
01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:10.280
<v Speaker 1>He's a garden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't get rid of seth.</v>

1541
01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:14.890
<v Speaker 1>Seth is the daddy of the decomposition </v>
<v Speaker 1>of states.</v>

1542
01:27:15.190 --> 01:27:16.023
<v Speaker 1>That's not going away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best you can do is hold it at bay </v>

1543
01:27:19.511 --> 01:27:20.344
<v Speaker 1>for periods of time and you have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>awake and aware of its constant </v>

1544
01:27:24.221 --> 01:27:26.020
<v Speaker 1>presence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

1545
01:27:26.021 --> 01:27:28.150
<v Speaker 1>he chased the step away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he gets his id back.</v>

1546
01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:31.113
<v Speaker 1>And so he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he reclaims his consciousness from the </v>

1547
01:27:35.321 --> 01:27:36.610
<v Speaker 1>malevolent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

1548
01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:39.460
<v Speaker 1>from malevolence essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might think,</v>

1549
01:27:39.461 --> 01:27:40.870
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what should you do,</v>

1550
01:27:41.070 --> 01:27:44.560
<v Speaker 1>you should slap that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I back in his head and then you know,</v>

1551
01:27:44.590 --> 01:27:45.423
<v Speaker 1>he's defeated evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now he should be king and that would </v>

1552
01:27:47.681 --> 01:27:48.514
<v Speaker 1>be a good ending to the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't what the egyptians do </v>

1553
01:27:50.501 --> 01:27:51.334
<v Speaker 1>with mrs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where they really get brilliant in my </v>

1554
01:27:52.571 --> 01:27:53.404
<v Speaker 1>estimation.</v>

1555
01:27:56.420 --> 01:28:00.590
<v Speaker 1>So horace takes his art and he goes back</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the underworld.</v>

1556
01:28:00.591 --> 01:28:01.424
<v Speaker 1>So he does this voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes back to the underworld and he </v>

1557
01:28:04.191 --> 01:28:08.230
<v Speaker 1>goes back to where was cyrus is existing</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's sort of the land of the day</v>

1558
01:28:08.231 --> 01:28:09.100
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I.</v>

1559
01:28:09.210 --> 01:28:11.020
<v Speaker 1>All.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus has this weird existence.</v>

1560
01:28:11.021 --> 01:28:14.630
<v Speaker 1>He scattered all over Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But his essence,</v>

1561
01:28:14.631 --> 01:28:18.710
<v Speaker 1>I suppose his spirit is down there in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the underworld,</v>

1562
01:28:18.711 --> 01:28:20.720
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly hell.</v>

1563
01:28:21.710 --> 01:28:22.543
<v Speaker 1>Hell is a suburb of the underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's the worst neighborhood of the </v>

1564
01:28:25.851 --> 01:28:27.800
<v Speaker 1>underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way of thinking about it.</v>

1565
01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:30.110
<v Speaker 1>You guys go to the underworld fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>often.</v>

1566
01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:35.060
<v Speaker 1>You may take a rare side trip to hell </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you probably regret it,</v>

1567
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:37.150
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we can,</v>

1568
01:28:37.190 --> 01:28:38.023
<v Speaker 1>we can talk about what that means </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it actually has a very specific </v>

1569
01:28:40.131 --> 01:28:41.190
<v Speaker 1>meaning anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1570
01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:42.300
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Resistant inhale.</v>

1571
01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:44.390
<v Speaker 1>He's just an underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's sitting there sort of,</v>

1572
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:48.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inactive and,</v>

1573
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:50.180
<v Speaker 1>and in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in rough shape.</v>

1574
01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:55.300
<v Speaker 1>So horse goes down to the underworld and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he phones finds those cyrus and he gives</v>

1575
01:28:56.391 --> 01:29:00.950
<v Speaker 1>him an I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then cyrus can see again,</v>

1576
01:29:00.990 --> 01:29:03.180
<v Speaker 1>remember he couldn't see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was willfully blind,</v>

1577
01:29:03.290 --> 01:29:04.123
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's partly what led to his </v>

1578
01:29:05.221 --> 01:29:07.470
<v Speaker 1>demise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So horace gives him this guy that's been</v>

1579
01:29:08.370 --> 01:29:10.530
<v Speaker 1>hard fought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1580
01:29:10.531 --> 01:29:13.140
<v Speaker 1>It's the eye with which he encountered </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>

1581
01:29:13.190 --> 01:29:16.470
<v Speaker 1>He gives cyrus that I heard some write </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1582
01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:19.860
<v Speaker 1>And so then horus and osiris go back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the surface.</v>

1583
01:29:20.110 --> 01:29:25.110
<v Speaker 1>We're old and they unite to form the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ruler of Egypt.</v>

1584
01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:27.533
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea is that the proper ruler</v>
<v Speaker 1>is obviously the thing that can pay </v>

1585
01:29:31.321 --> 01:29:36.000
<v Speaker 1>attention and conquer the pathology of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the state and willful blindness.</v>

1586
01:29:36.001 --> 01:29:38.400
<v Speaker 1>But it's more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the thing that does that.</v>

1587
01:29:38.610 --> 01:29:42.120
<v Speaker 1>And then rejuvenate's the state and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1588
01:29:42.690 --> 01:29:45.180
<v Speaker 1>one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is quite interesting.</v>

1589
01:29:45.181 --> 01:29:46.014
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1590
01:29:46.890 --> 01:29:47.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1591
01:29:51.570 --> 01:29:53.690
<v Speaker 1>the hippie culture in the 19 sixties </v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

1592
01:29:53.770 --> 01:29:54.603
<v Speaker 1>was a revolutionary culture and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a case that during the sixties and </v>

1593
01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:00.800
<v Speaker 1>in the latter part of the fifties that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1594
01:30:00.801 --> 01:30:05.030
<v Speaker 1>young people's attention was very much </v>
<v Speaker 1>focused on certain pathological elements</v>

1595
01:30:05.031 --> 01:30:05.864
<v Speaker 1>of the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know the civil rights movement seem to </v>

1596
01:30:08.601 --> 01:30:09.434
<v Speaker 1>be a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a movement towards the </v>

1597
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:11.303
<v Speaker 1>emancIpation of women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were lots of things that I think </v>

1598
01:30:14.151 --> 01:30:18.260
<v Speaker 1>you can look at from a distance and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1599
01:30:18.380 --> 01:30:19.213
<v Speaker 1>good work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there was the other element of </v>

1600
01:30:20.751 --> 01:30:21.980
<v Speaker 1>It which was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1601
01:30:21.981 --> 01:30:22.814
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>down with the state and don't trust </v>

1602
01:30:26.181 --> 01:30:29.420
<v Speaker 1>anyone over 30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's kind of stupid because first</v>

1603
01:30:29.421 --> 01:30:29.991
<v Speaker 1>of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1604
01:30:29.991 --> 01:30:32.360
<v Speaker 1>it's not that long until you're 30 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then what do you do?</v>

1605
01:30:32.780 --> 01:30:33.830
<v Speaker 1>And second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1606
01:30:33.950 --> 01:30:34.850
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1607
01:30:34.851 --> 01:30:37.280
<v Speaker 1>you can't throw the damn baby out with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bathwater.</v>

1608
01:30:37.310 --> 01:30:38.031
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1609
01:30:38.031 --> 01:30:40.940
<v Speaker 1>you're probably doing that because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to grow up ever.</v>

1610
01:30:41.090 --> 01:30:43.280
<v Speaker 1>you're just peter pan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And second.</v>

1611
01:30:43.281 --> 01:30:44.114
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can't leave ocirus length </v>
<v Speaker 1>with cyrus languishing in the </v>

1612
01:30:49.071 --> 01:30:49.904
<v Speaker 1>underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to give them vision and bring </v>

1613
01:30:51.991 --> 01:30:56.480
<v Speaker 1>them back up to the surface because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't care how attentive you are,</v>

1614
01:30:57.290 --> 01:30:58.123
<v Speaker 1>if you're also not wise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be good for </v>

1615
01:30:59.841 --> 01:31:03.450
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the wisdom is partly the integration</v>

1616
01:31:03.451 --> 01:31:04.284
<v Speaker 1>of the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your culture has to offer you into your </v>

1617
01:31:06.261 --> 01:31:07.094
<v Speaker 1>character so that you can be an avatar </v>
<v Speaker 1>of culture and attentive avatar of </v>

1618
01:31:11.241 --> 01:31:14.030
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you're a well balanced soul.</v>

1619
01:31:14.690 --> 01:31:15.523
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the egyptIans figured all this out </v>

1620
01:31:16.551 --> 01:31:17.384
<v Speaker 1>and then it's even cooler than that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they use this idea of the union </v>

1621
01:31:23.361 --> 01:31:24.194
<v Speaker 1>of horus and cyrus as their conceptual </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of what gave the feral </v>

1622
01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:32.570
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is because again,</v>

1623
01:31:32.571 --> 01:31:34.550
<v Speaker 1>like the mesopotamIans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to figure out,</v>

1624
01:31:34.551 --> 01:31:35.840
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should rule,</v>

1625
01:31:35.900 --> 01:31:37.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should be above all,</v>

1626
01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:39.950
<v Speaker 1>and the mesopotamians figured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1627
01:31:39.951 --> 01:31:41.020
<v Speaker 1>it's something like marduk.</v>

1628
01:31:41.030 --> 01:31:42.710
<v Speaker 1>He's got lots of eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can talk.</v>

1629
01:31:42.711 --> 01:31:43.580
<v Speaker 1>He's brave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll,</v>

1630
01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:45.620
<v Speaker 1>he'll conquer the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He makes things.</v>

1631
01:31:45.630 --> 01:31:48.110
<v Speaker 1>As a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he makes a pretty good talk.</v>

1632
01:31:48.111 --> 01:31:52.430
<v Speaker 1>God and the egyptians added a level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophistication to that because</v>

1633
01:31:54.170 --> 01:31:57.590
<v Speaker 1>horace is not only the thing that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>go into the underworld.</v>

1634
01:31:57.890 --> 01:32:00.610
<v Speaker 1>He goes into the underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he rescues things,</v>

1635
01:32:00.611 --> 01:32:01.444
<v Speaker 1>have tremendous value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then unites with them so that not </v>

1636
01:32:04.601 --> 01:32:08.020
<v Speaker 1>only can he see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's wise,</v>

1637
01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:10.510
<v Speaker 1>and so then that's what the pharaoh was </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be in.</v>

1638
01:32:10.511 --> 01:32:11.344
<v Speaker 1>The egyptians basically characterized </v>
<v Speaker 1>that union as something akin to the </v>

1639
01:32:14.321 --> 01:32:18.640
<v Speaker 1>immortal soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now eliana tracks this development.</v>

1640
01:32:18.641 --> 01:32:21.790
<v Speaker 1>He called the democratization of osiris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>

1641
01:32:22.150 --> 01:32:25.820
<v Speaker 1>basically only the pharaoh was allowed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the horace.</v>

1642
01:32:25.821 --> 01:32:28.180
<v Speaker 1>So cyrus union in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1643
01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:31.750
<v Speaker 1>so and in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way he was god on earth,</v>

1644
01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:34.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and which is a conception of course,</v>

1645
01:32:34.671 --> 01:32:36.610
<v Speaker 1>that this lasted into cultures for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1646
01:32:36.611 --> 01:32:37.600
<v Speaker 1>very long period of time.</v>

1647
01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:38.433
<v Speaker 1>The japanese still thought that way </v>
<v Speaker 1>about their emperor until the end of </v>

1648
01:32:40.930 --> 01:32:43.180
<v Speaker 1>world war two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And many of them still think that way.</v>

1649
01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:46.390
<v Speaker 1>So he was the embodiment of divine </v>
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty.</v>

1650
01:32:46.630 --> 01:32:47.463
<v Speaker 1>It was in the leader only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as the egyptian state developed the </v>

1651
01:32:51.461 --> 01:32:52.294
<v Speaker 1>idea that that soul was an attribute </v>
<v Speaker 1>started to descend down the power </v>

1652
01:32:56.561 --> 01:32:57.394
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So after awhile the aristocracy started </v>

1653
01:32:59.051 --> 01:33:01.840
<v Speaker 1>to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then now,</v>

1654
01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:03.970
<v Speaker 1>and this is a radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>oversimplification,</v>

1655
01:33:03.971 --> 01:33:05.530
<v Speaker 1>but it'll do for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>

1656
01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:08.600
<v Speaker 1>for the purposes of this discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1657
01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:10.660
<v Speaker 1>by the time the jews came along and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>come,</v>

1658
01:33:10.661 --> 01:33:13.180
<v Speaker 1>it came out of Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mythologically speaking,</v>

1659
01:33:14.590 --> 01:33:17.560
<v Speaker 1>the idea that there could be a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1660
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:18.583
<v Speaker 1>a union or a relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that was divided in something </v>

1661
01:33:21.311 --> 01:33:25.030
<v Speaker 1>that was individual was distributed a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long ways down the power hierarchy.</v>

1662
01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:26.633
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then by the time the greeks showed </v>

1663
01:33:27.731 --> 01:33:30.010
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well in some sense it was all males,</v>

1664
01:33:30.011 --> 01:33:32.170
<v Speaker 1>at least all males who were part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>polity.</v>

1665
01:33:32.170 --> 01:33:35.200
<v Speaker 1>And then when the christians emerged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was everyone,</v>

1666
01:33:35.770 --> 01:33:38.560
<v Speaker 1>prostitutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tax collectors,</v>

1667
01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:40.150
<v Speaker 1>thieves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>murderers,</v>

1668
01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:41.373
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the idea of sovereignty started </v>

1669
01:33:43.721 --> 01:33:44.770
<v Speaker 1>to become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1670
01:33:44.830 --> 01:33:46.960
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a mythological attribute,</v>

1671
01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:47.833
<v Speaker 1>was identified with the ruler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then it became a psychological </v>

1672
01:33:50.771 --> 01:33:53.770
<v Speaker 1>attribute that was distributed across </v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire population.</v>

1673
01:33:54.130 --> 01:33:56.560
<v Speaker 1>It's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's brilliant.</v>

1674
01:33:56.830 --> 01:33:57.663
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really those conceptualizations </v>

1675
01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:03.940
<v Speaker 1>form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the substructure of our belief that each</v>

1676
01:34:03.941 --> 01:34:06.930
<v Speaker 1>person is divinely valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1677
01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:09.730
<v Speaker 1>in their own right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they have inalienable rights.</v>

1678
01:34:09.731 --> 01:34:11.110
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're a murderer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1679
01:34:11.111 --> 01:34:14.350
<v Speaker 1>The state is very restricted in what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do to you.</v>

1680
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Even if you committed a terrible crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you admit to it,</v>

1681
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.200
<v Speaker 1>the state is still very restricted in </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it's allowed to do with you because</v>

1682
01:34:23.410 --> 01:34:24.243
<v Speaker 1>there's an idea that there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>about you that has the quality of </v>

1683
01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:30.790
<v Speaker 1>transcendent value.</v>

1684
01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:34.990
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly it and well we know some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the attributes,</v>

1685
01:34:34.991 --> 01:34:35.824
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them is the you can see and pay </v>

1686
01:34:37.151 --> 01:34:37.984
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other is that you can speak and </v>

1687
01:34:39.551 --> 01:34:43.150
<v Speaker 1>communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other is that you can become wise,</v>

1688
01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:44.513
<v Speaker 1>that you can approach things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>frighten you with courage and generate </v>

1689
01:34:48.191 --> 01:34:49.024
<v Speaker 1>new information as a consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's lots of things about you </v>

1690
01:34:51.221 --> 01:34:56.221
<v Speaker 1>that the relationship between chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 1>order actually literally dependent and,</v>

1691
01:34:58.850 --> 01:35:01.820
<v Speaker 1>aNd that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the state has come to respect the</v>

1692
01:35:01.821 --> 01:35:02.654
<v Speaker 1>individual partly because the individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>is by necessity the thing that </v>

1693
01:35:06.981 --> 01:35:10.310
<v Speaker 1>rejuvenates the state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this dynamic relationship</v>

1694
01:35:10.311 --> 01:35:12.260
<v Speaker 1>between the two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The state structures you,</v>

1695
01:35:12.620 --> 01:35:17.620
<v Speaker 1>but it's old and blind and there's lots </v>
<v Speaker 1>of things that can't see and it's partly</v>

1696
01:35:17.691 --> 01:35:19.040
<v Speaker 1>corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>OKay.</v>

1697
01:35:19.041 --> 01:35:20.900
<v Speaker 1>But it's a hell of a lot better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

1698
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.823
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then you're like the forerunner </v>

1699
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:25.303
<v Speaker 1>of the state and you can pay attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you can see where things </v>

1700
01:35:28.041 --> 01:35:31.550
<v Speaker 1>aren't working exactly right where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't working property and fix them,</v>

1701
01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:36.770
<v Speaker 1>and so then the state maintains its </v>
<v Speaker 1>protective structure across time and you</v>

1702
01:35:36.771 --> 01:35:39.230
<v Speaker 1>exist in a dialectical relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1703
01:35:39.670 --> 01:35:40.503
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see by the time the christian hero </v>

1704
01:35:42.951 --> 01:35:43.784
<v Speaker 1>mythology emerges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>christ is more the [inaudible] </v>

1705
01:35:47.180 --> 01:35:51.710
<v Speaker 1>constructor of the state than he is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that it encounters chaos,</v>

1706
01:35:51.711 --> 01:35:52.544
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a huge chunk of the christian </v>

1707
01:35:53.871 --> 01:35:58.840
<v Speaker 1>story is about the antagonism between </v>
<v Speaker 1>him and his culture and,</v>

1708
01:35:58.930 --> 01:35:59.763
<v Speaker 1>and the roman culture as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the whole existential drama actually </v>

1709
01:36:02.331 --> 01:36:04.190
<v Speaker 1>shifts from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1710
01:36:04.370 --> 01:36:08.630
<v Speaker 1>hero as buttress against nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of course would have been the case</v>

1711
01:36:08.631 --> 01:36:09.464
<v Speaker 1>earlier to hero as thing that decomposes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and reconstructs culture in a radical </v>

1712
01:36:14.091 --> 01:36:15.290
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1713
01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:18.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moses does the same things and other and</v>

1714
01:36:18.230 --> 01:36:21.710
<v Speaker 1>moses is a master of water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a transformative agent.</v>

1715
01:36:21.711 --> 01:36:25.040
<v Speaker 1>So it's an indication of exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same sort of idea.</v>

1716
01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:27.513
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1717
01:36:32.580 --> 01:36:33.870
<v Speaker 1>it's a good time for a break.</v>
