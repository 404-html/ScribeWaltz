00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.350
[inaudible]

2
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.420
<v 1>I never thought of sharing culture or my own history.</v>

3
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.110
<v 0>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.240
<v 1>Comforts my heart knowing that I,</v>

5
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.080
I'm allowed to do this without getting this trap whipped.

6
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.440
They're thrown in the closet anymore.
That's big for me.

7
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.970
The big for me,
cause this was sure,
took a lot of punishment.

8
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.960
It took a lot of punishment for a being a native person.

9
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.980
And this is just one of our ways of showing that

10
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.800
we're alive and well

11
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.420
<v 0>give me a second.</v>

12
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.150
<v 1>Got Permission from my elders and my cheese to be allowed to use all of these,</v>

13
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.560
all of these different meanings.
All the different designs.

14
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.750
I almost cried when they said use whatever you want.

15
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.020
I guess the reason why I was Craig Craig was because

16
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:09.683
<v 0>okay,</v>

17
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.210
<v 1>you remembering
how much weight weight too</v>

18
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.950
not allowed to draw a curve or talked to her English.

19
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.083
<v 0>It's tough.</v>

20
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.240
<v 1>Did your mom on his street car parts?
You just,
she thought,</v>

21
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.633
Huh?

22
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.993
Well

23
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.650
I was very lucky when grandparents were at home.

24
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.063
That's all I heard.

25
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.630
Go to a shit.
My grandparents to uh,

26
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.800
um,
when they had private house services.
Yeah.

27
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.400
Walk more and grinding is there.

28
00:03:43.401 --> 00:03:48.270
And listen to your granny and them sing songs and

29
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.060
we'd have a house for elders,

30
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.680
for the elders all sit around and as they're walking in,

31
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.160
so grab a Bible or book that,
uh,

32
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.150
you know that their pupils reading or the hymns

33
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.670
and not order them the harder read.

34
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.900
But I guess it's just the thing to do is grab a Bible and sit down.

35
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.620
I don't know.
But when I was sitting there and my granny,

36
00:04:21.621 --> 00:04:25.890
I sat there and watched check in it.
I yes,

37
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.980
what they do in there
and I watch that.

38
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.580
Yeah,
I seen him.
Every one of them were private Bible.

39
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.750
Not one of them would open up the book or just sit and start singing hymns and

40
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.040
[inaudible].
That's where I thought it core is here.
We do it in a park wall.

41
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.453
<v 0>Oh</v>

42
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.893
Wow.

43
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.450
<v 2>When you become a prisoner,
it's not an easy life.</v>

44
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.250
And that's the reason why my son Boon

45
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.520
decided to do this because that's the only way he could heal.

46
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.510
And when you start healing,

47
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.170
the changes of your life starts again.

48
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:02.290
That's when you become who you really are because we've carried so much pain.

49
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.780
So much hurts.
No granny's know.

50
00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:13.250
GRANDPA's allowed to be close to us,
not allowed to speak our language.

51
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.570
Many things,
songs taken away from us,
our dances,

52
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.160
and we were not even allowed to embrace our families anymore.

53
00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.883
<v 0>Okay,</v>

54
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.170
let me send that.

55
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.420
<v 2>We'll all leave this world and when there's time for us to leave this world,</v>

56
00:06:38.421 --> 00:06:39.590
you have half the story.

57
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.720
You have something to town your children of what happened to us and our great

58
00:06:44.721 --> 00:06:48.410
grandchildren,
that we were not just drunks.

59
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.830
We're not just alcoholics and drug addicts.

60
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.720
We picked up things that wasn't ours because we wanted to hide the pain,

61
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.940
and now today we're going to bless it so that we don't pull the pin out anymore.

62
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.953
<v 0>Okay.</v>

63
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.240
<v 3>Ah Huh.</v>

64
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.120
<v 2>What can paint.</v>
