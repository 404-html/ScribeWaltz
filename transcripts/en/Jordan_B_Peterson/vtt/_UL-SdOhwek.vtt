WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.930
<v Speaker 1>So how are we going to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are People just going to ask?</v>

2
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.730
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.280
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Speed brings chaos.</v>

4
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.010
<v Speaker 1>So you would ask that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

5
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.070
<v Speaker 1>the question is speech brings order out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of chaos.</v>

6
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.163
<v Speaker 1>That's what I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it appears that speech brings chaos </v>

7
00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:42.320
<v Speaker 1>out of order as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is it does,</v>

8
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.583
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was only so many complications I </v>

9
00:00:45.141 --> 00:00:47.300
<v Speaker 1>could address in the talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously.</v>

10
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.633
<v Speaker 1>If you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the most archaic of </v>

11
00:00:51.681 --> 00:00:52.514
<v Speaker 1>Archetypal Heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heroes confront something that </v>

12
00:00:55.731 --> 00:00:56.564
<v Speaker 1>represents chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's usually a monster that bears a </v>

13
00:00:59.151 --> 00:00:59.984
<v Speaker 1>treasure of some sort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a symbolic representation of </v>

14
00:01:03.111 --> 00:01:05.360
<v Speaker 1>the class of all unexplored things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

15
00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:06.194
<v Speaker 1>Because things that we have not yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>explored are threatening and </v>

16
00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:11.420
<v Speaker 1>destructive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also offer us infinite potential,</v>

17
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.200
<v Speaker 1>but more elaborated hero stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

18
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Also reverse that and say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

19
00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:19.610
<v Speaker 1>there are times when the order has </v>
<v Speaker 1>become so corrupted,</v>

20
00:01:19.611 --> 00:01:22.280
<v Speaker 1>rigid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that free speech fragments that into its</v>

21
00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:24.230
<v Speaker 1>parts so that it can rejuvenate itself.</v>

22
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.580
<v Speaker 1>And so actually in the gospels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the hero.</v>

23
00:01:28.581 --> 00:01:32.840
<v Speaker 1>That Christ is basically represented as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not so much the dragon.</v>

24
00:01:32.841 --> 00:01:35.810
<v Speaker 1>Confronting the dragon slayer who </v>
<v Speaker 1>gathers the treasure,</v>

25
00:01:35.811 --> 00:01:36.644
<v Speaker 1>although that's implicit in the in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>juxtaposition of Christ with the figure </v>

26
00:01:40.311 --> 00:01:41.144
<v Speaker 1>of like a Serpentine Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Christ is the thing that stands up </v>

27
00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:45.104
<v Speaker 1>against the corrupt state and </v>
<v Speaker 1>rejuvenated through speech and so </v>

28
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.320
<v Speaker 1>technically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech.</v>

29
00:01:51.321 --> 00:01:52.154
<v Speaker 1>The logos is the thing that mediates </v>
<v Speaker 1>between chaos and order and you can </v>

30
00:01:55.131 --> 00:01:57.150
<v Speaker 1>think about this is represented in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

31
00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.550
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in many cultures.</v>

32
00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:01.190
<v Speaker 1>This idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see it most specifically,</v>

33
00:02:01.191 --> 00:02:02.024
<v Speaker 1>I would say in the Dallas </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualization because in the Dallas </v>

34
00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:07.820
<v Speaker 1>world being is made out of chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>

35
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.010
<v Speaker 1>Yin and Yang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine and feminine.</v>

36
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.270
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally it's chaos in order in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order is the fact that wherever you go,</v>

37
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.283
<v Speaker 1>there are things you understand in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>and chaos is the fact that wherever you </v>

38
00:02:18.051 --> 00:02:18.884
<v Speaker 1>go there are things you don't understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the idea is that being is made </v>

39
00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:25.310
<v Speaker 1>out of the things that you understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the things that you don't understand</v>

40
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.263
<v Speaker 1>and it's always that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why dow is the symbol of being </v>

41
00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:31.790
<v Speaker 1>per se,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's the case.</v>

42
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.740
<v Speaker 1>Your brain is adapted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

43
00:02:33.741 --> 00:02:34.574
<v Speaker 1>it's partly why it has two hemispheres </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the world that you understand and </v>

44
00:02:37.401 --> 00:02:41.180
<v Speaker 1>the world you don't understand the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>you understand roughly speaking,</v>

45
00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:44.990
<v Speaker 1>being handled by the left and the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't understand roughly speaking,</v>

46
00:02:44.991 --> 00:02:47.180
<v Speaker 1>being handled by the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

47
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.390
<v Speaker 1>it's that line down the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Dow,</v>

48
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:51.643
<v Speaker 1>that's meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you have one foot in chaos and </v>

49
00:02:53.511 --> 00:02:55.970
<v Speaker 1>one foot in order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're maximizing information,</v>

50
00:02:55.971 --> 00:02:56.804
<v Speaker 1>float and rejuvenating yourself at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same time that you're maintaining </v>

51
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 1>structure and you will report on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>internally as engagement in the world.</v>

52
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.853
<v Speaker 1>It's the most fundamental orienting </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense that you have and it's deeply </v>

53
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 1>instantiated neurologically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably deeply,</v>

54
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 1>and so it really is the case from an </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary perspective that reality is</v>

55
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 1>chaos and order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that to which you're adapted and so</v>

56
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:21.964
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you're speaking on behalf of </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos and sometimes you're speaking on </v>

57
00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:25.324
<v Speaker 1>behalf of order.</v>

58
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.070
<v Speaker 1>It's more complicated than now too </v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

59
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:30.170
<v Speaker 1>because when we have a dialog saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

60
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 1>we're mutually attempting to climb </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the truth.</v>

61
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:35.920
<v Speaker 1>Instead of convincing each other that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're right,</v>

62
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.430
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what we're doing is engaging in the</v>

63
00:03:39.431 --> 00:03:40.264
<v Speaker 1>simultaneous fragmentation of old and </v>
<v Speaker 1>archaic belief systems and they're </v>

64
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:44.794
<v Speaker 1>updating and you can experience that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because someone will say something that </v>

65
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.173
<v Speaker 1>sets you back and then you'll get what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying and it'll click together </v>

66
00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:54.910
<v Speaker 1>and what you're experiencing is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>death of a of a,</v>

67
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.900
<v Speaker 1>of an old conceptualization structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its disintegration,</v>

68
00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.883
<v Speaker 1>and then it's reconfiguration in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tighter and tighter order and people </v>

69
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:05.110
<v Speaker 1>love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They live for that.</v>

70
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:05.680
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

71
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.513
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what keeps you alive and you can </v>

72
00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:11.980
<v Speaker 1>experience that in a deep conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a truthful conversation,</v>

73
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.130
<v Speaker 1>a meeting of the minds and soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people love that.</v>

74
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:15.964
<v Speaker 1>It's curative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All psychotherapists know this because </v>

75
00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:19.594
<v Speaker 1>what you do in psychotherapy as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in addition to helping people face the </v>

76
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:27.340
<v Speaker 1>things that they're most afraid of so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can overcome them,</v>

77
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.400
<v Speaker 1>is to allow them to tell someone the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

78
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.070
<v Speaker 1>What happened to you all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

79
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:34.653
<v Speaker 1>so they tell you and they take </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves apart and put themselves </v>

80
00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:38.170
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

81
00:04:38.171 --> 00:04:42.820
<v Speaker 1>they're speaking the truth about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened and it puts them together.</v>

82
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:43.950
<v Speaker 1>It's at the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

83
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.490
<v Speaker 1>the two fundamental elements of </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy are let's find what you're</v>

84
00:04:48.491 --> 00:04:49.324
<v Speaker 1>afraid of and avoiding and help you </v>
<v Speaker 1>confront it so that you can gather the </v>

85
00:04:52.361 --> 00:04:53.194
<v Speaker 1>information that's there and let's allow</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to lay your story out in all of its </v>

86
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.560
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe in detail so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>straighten yourself out through speech.</v>

87
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.990
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly what happens in </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy,</v>

88
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.170
<v Speaker 1>so when it should happen in every real </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>

89
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:10.660
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the spiritual purpose of a marriage</v>

90
00:05:10.661 --> 00:05:11.650
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

91
00:05:11.651 --> 00:05:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Because you face someone who's different</v>
<v Speaker 1>than you that you are tied to and cannot</v>

92
00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:19.600
<v Speaker 1>run from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you can reveal your really,</v>

93
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:20.860
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a critical.</v>

94
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.760
<v Speaker 1>It's a critical part of marriage because</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can run from someone,</v>

95
00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:25.594
<v Speaker 1>they will never show you their true face</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if someone shows you their true </v>

96
00:05:29.411 --> 00:05:30.910
<v Speaker 1>face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will run,</v>

97
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.580
<v Speaker 1>and so you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a marriage ceremony,</v>

98
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.990
<v Speaker 1>I will allow you to show me your true </v>
<v Speaker 1>face and I will not run,</v>

99
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.680
<v Speaker 1>and unless you mean that you'll never be</v>
<v Speaker 1>married.</v>

100
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.873
<v Speaker 1>You'll never understand what it means </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll never reap the benefits of </v>

101
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:47.860
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which are practical obviously,</v>

102
00:05:47.861 --> 00:05:52.270
<v Speaker 1>but also spiritual and psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason for the vow,</v>

103
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.313
<v Speaker 1>but it has to be a vow because otherwise</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a back door open and you'll </v>

104
00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:57.154
<v Speaker 1>never really tell the person what your </v>
<v Speaker 1>light and no bloody wonder because </v>

105
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.160
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who wants to know what you're like,</v>

106
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.950
<v Speaker 1>not even you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>

107
00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.253
<v Speaker 3>I'm not surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to thank you because what was </v>

108
00:06:14.261 --> 00:06:17.530
<v Speaker 3>surprising about your lecture today was </v>
<v Speaker 3>this concept of altruism.</v>

109
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.373
<v Speaker 3>I think you've been able to just put </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything together and at the end come </v>

110
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:25.050
<v Speaker 3>up with a higher value of altruism and </v>
<v Speaker 3>to was a surprise.</v>

111
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.033
<v Speaker 3>You don't come in here and I have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship with altruism and the one </v>

112
00:06:29.501 --> 00:06:33.450
<v Speaker 3>that I find that it's difficult for me </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that this is an evolutionary process.</v>

113
00:06:33.451 --> 00:06:35.930
<v Speaker 3>So my brain is an organ is developed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

114
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.210
<v Speaker 3>and and I'm amazed at how often I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>of three people,</v>

115
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.081
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>myself,</v>

116
00:06:41.081 --> 00:06:45.850
<v Speaker 3>and I do the point where where I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually written down,</v>

117
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:47.443
<v Speaker 3>counted all of the iterations of me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>myself and I and neither my thoughts or </v>

118
00:06:50.591 --> 00:06:53.560
<v Speaker 3>my speech or even in someone else's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you'll get the page.</v>

119
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:55.540
<v Speaker 3>We think of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

120
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.943
<v Speaker 3>as far as I've been able to ascertain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because I have to expend energy to </v>

121
00:07:00.341 --> 00:07:01.174
<v Speaker 3>think about someone else and and and yet</v>
<v Speaker 3>yet I'm addicted to decent comfort </v>

122
00:07:07.091 --> 00:07:09.760
<v Speaker 3>because my natural evolution is what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Peace and comfort.</v>

123
00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.860
<v Speaker 3>You hear it in alcoholics anonymous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take the problem.</v>

124
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.900
<v Speaker 3>You're addicted to ease and comfort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do I overcome my,</v>

125
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:24.050
<v Speaker 3>my sense of ease and comfort to be able </v>
<v Speaker 3>to make altruism</v>

126
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:26.980
<v Speaker 3>a more natural state of being.</v>

127
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:28.050
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

128
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.870
<v Speaker 1>Good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>

129
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:36.530
<v Speaker 1>the first was a comment about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>emphasis in my talk today on altruism,</v>

130
00:07:37.201 --> 00:07:38.034
<v Speaker 1>and the second is how do I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do people overcome their proclivity </v>

131
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.920
<v Speaker 1>to only act on their own behalf?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

132
00:07:43.921 --> 00:07:44.754
<v Speaker 1>so the first thing I will say is that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't believe that what I spoke about </v>

133
00:07:48.421 --> 00:07:51.330
<v Speaker 1>today was in favor of altruism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

134
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.110
<v Speaker 1>and that's not a negative comment on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your question,</v>

135
00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.410
<v Speaker 1>but there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a,</v>

136
00:07:58.470 --> 00:07:59.710
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a pride.</v>

137
00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:00.563
<v Speaker 1>Here's a primary religious injunction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Treat the other person like you would </v>

138
00:08:03.841 --> 00:08:04.674
<v Speaker 1>like to be treated yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That does not mean be nice to other </v>

139
00:08:08.131 --> 00:08:08.964
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does not mean sacrifice yourself </v>

140
00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:16.610
<v Speaker 1>excessively for other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means think about the other person as</v>

141
00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:17.454
<v Speaker 1>if they were you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and figuring out how you can mutually </v>

142
00:08:20.371 --> 00:08:23.490
<v Speaker 1>interacts to better both of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

143
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.980
<v Speaker 1>you have to build yourself into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>equation.</v>

144
00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.173
<v Speaker 1>It's an equation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that it's not that others are </v>

145
00:08:30.091 --> 00:08:32.580
<v Speaker 1>more valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that we're all valuable,</v>

146
00:08:32.581 --> 00:08:34.140
<v Speaker 1>were equally valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you think,</v>

147
00:08:34.141 --> 00:08:35.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you remind yourself of that?</v>

148
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.920
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is through terror</v>
<v Speaker 1>because terror is the genuine motivator,</v>

149
00:08:40.921 --> 00:08:41.754
<v Speaker 1>so they save.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fear of God is the beginning of all </v>

150
00:08:45.271 --> 00:08:47.220
<v Speaker 1>wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

151
00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:48.893
<v Speaker 1>On means?</v>
<v Speaker 1>First that you don't get away with </v>

152
00:08:49.741 --> 00:08:54.741
<v Speaker 1>anything and it's really useful to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because if you really know that you</v>

153
00:08:54.751 --> 00:08:57.980
<v Speaker 1>won't to get away with while you still </v>
<v Speaker 1>will because people are stupid but,</v>

154
00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.900
<v Speaker 1>but at least it will mitigate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility.</v>

155
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.270
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

156
00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:05.280
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you something that young said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is quite.</v>

157
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:09.450
<v Speaker 1>This is quite profound and I think the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right answer to this question.</v>

158
00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:14.260
<v Speaker 1>So young believed he was interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the emergence of higher morality.</v>

159
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.740
<v Speaker 1>Something that the developmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist,</v>

160
00:09:16.741 --> 00:09:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Yom Piaget was also interested in.</v>

161
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Here's a thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We started out as individuals,</v>

162
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.940
<v Speaker 1>then we learned to play games with other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

163
00:09:23.941 --> 00:09:25.140
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

164
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.820
<v Speaker 1>learn how to play games with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

165
00:09:26.821 --> 00:09:29.610
<v Speaker 1>and that made them social.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So our society is a game.</v>

166
00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:34.170
<v Speaker 1>It's a giant gate that we're all playing</v>
<v Speaker 1>together voluntarily.</v>

167
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.220
<v Speaker 1>And so children will first learned how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to play the game and only later did they</v>

168
00:09:38.221 --> 00:09:39.054
<v Speaker 1>learn the rules of the game and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned how to play the game first and </v>

169
00:09:41.251 --> 00:09:43.560
<v Speaker 1>then learn the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to speak the rules,</v>

170
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.753
<v Speaker 1>and then at some point they realized </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were also creators of the </v>

171
00:09:46.741 --> 00:09:47.574
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's moral development on a </v>

172
00:09:51.781 --> 00:09:52.950
<v Speaker 1>continual on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a.</v>

173
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:57.390
<v Speaker 1>it's not a continuum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fractured staircase upward,</v>

174
00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:02.130
<v Speaker 1>but young was interested in elements of </v>
<v Speaker 1>moral action that were higher than that.</v>

175
00:10:02.131 --> 00:10:04.980
<v Speaker 1>And so he conceptualized it </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolically.</v>

176
00:10:04.981 --> 00:10:05.814
<v Speaker 1>So imagine this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did this in the last book he wrote </v>

177
00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:09.350
<v Speaker 1>called mysterium conjunction us.</v>

178
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.093
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that you exist so that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptual structures and your emotions </v>

179
00:10:15.331 --> 00:10:17.580
<v Speaker 1>are in an uneasy relationship with one </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

180
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.700
<v Speaker 1>So you're sort of a house divided </v>
<v Speaker 1>amongst yourself.</v>

181
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.073
<v Speaker 1>And so what you have to do is you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to put together your mind and your and </v>

182
00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:26.160
<v Speaker 1>your emotions so that they're working as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

183
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.233
<v Speaker 1>as a unit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you do that in part by actually </v>

184
00:10:28.771 --> 00:10:29.604
<v Speaker 1>being forthright about what it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want for yourself and to other </v>

185
00:10:32.641 --> 00:10:36.480
<v Speaker 1>people and to learn how to negotiate </v>
<v Speaker 1>that so that inner tension disappears.</v>

186
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:37.463
<v Speaker 1>And so now you're a unified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a unified entity of emotion and </v>

187
00:10:40.861 --> 00:10:43.950
<v Speaker 1>thought they're not conflicting with one</v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

188
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:48.930
<v Speaker 1>And then what you do is you take that </v>
<v Speaker 1>entity which is still in some sense,</v>

189
00:10:48.931 --> 00:10:52.140
<v Speaker 1>separate from your body because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not acting these out and you bring those</v>

190
00:10:52.141 --> 00:10:52.974
<v Speaker 1>two together and he thought about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the psychological equivalent of the </v>

191
00:10:56.251 --> 00:11:00.510
<v Speaker 1>incarnation had integrated spirit </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrating with the body.</v>

192
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:01.523
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that you take </v>
<v Speaker 1>your emotions and motivations and </v>

193
00:11:04.471 --> 00:11:09.120
<v Speaker 1>capacity for thinking that are now one </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and you act out those things you.</v>

194
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:09.983
<v Speaker 1>So you embodied them in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's another thing that brings </v>

195
00:11:11.971 --> 00:11:12.804
<v Speaker 1>integrity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there was a step past that in </v>

196
00:11:14.401 --> 00:11:17.350
<v Speaker 1>the step past that is to understand that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no d.</v>

197
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.760
<v Speaker 1>So you have the integrated spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind and body</v>

198
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.333
<v Speaker 1>in opposition to the world and this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next thing you do is realize that </v>

199
00:11:25.771 --> 00:11:29.360
<v Speaker 1>there is no opposition with the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you are is a.</v>

200
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.050
<v Speaker 1>This is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complicated.</v>

201
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.180
<v Speaker 1>You're walking down the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the street is a good example of this</v>

202
00:11:36.181 --> 00:11:38.100
<v Speaker 1>in Toronto and they're guesstimated </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic,</v>

203
00:11:38.101 --> 00:11:41.190
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>littering the landscape so to speak.</v>

204
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.900
<v Speaker 1>You walk around them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

205
00:11:42.901 --> 00:11:44.760
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not me.</v>

206
00:11:44.761 --> 00:11:45.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes it is.</v>

207
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:46.973
<v Speaker 1>It's you in so far as your tendency is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to react in a negative way and to start </v>

208
00:11:52.261 --> 00:11:53.094
<v Speaker 1>the territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a disturbance in your field of </v>

209
00:11:55.511 --> 00:11:57.250
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's you.</v>

210
00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:58.653
<v Speaker 1>Now you don't know what to do about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I wouldn't recommend that you do </v>

211
00:12:00.491 --> 00:12:02.410
<v Speaker 1>anything because you'd probably just </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it worse.</v>

212
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.180
<v Speaker 1>It's a very big problem that's lying </v>
<v Speaker 1>there on the sidewalk and it may be well</v>

213
00:12:07.181 --> 00:12:08.014
<v Speaker 1>beyond your capacity to fix it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in so far as it's a disturbance in </v>

214
00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:14.170
<v Speaker 1>your field of being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's you,</v>

215
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:19.840
<v Speaker 1>it's you and all the problems that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world that you experience there,</v>

216
00:12:19.841 --> 00:12:24.841
<v Speaker 1>you and so you stop thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>things in terms of an opposition between</v>

217
00:12:24.881 --> 00:12:25.714
<v Speaker 1>what's good for you and what's good for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world because there is no </v>

218
00:12:27.281 --> 00:12:28.114
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

219
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:29.163
<v Speaker 1>There's no difference between the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that that doesn't mean that the </v>

220
00:12:31.331 --> 00:12:32.164
<v Speaker 1>pathway from what's good for you in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>more limited domain to what's good for </v>

221
00:12:37.091 --> 00:12:39.250
<v Speaker 1>everyone is an easy one to compute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

222
00:12:39.251 --> 00:12:41.410
<v Speaker 1>very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there is no,</v>

223
00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.930
<v Speaker 1>there is no technical difference between</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

224
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if I'm engaged in a psychotherapeutic</v>

225
00:12:47.801 --> 00:12:50.740
<v Speaker 1>dialogue with my clients when I'm doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it properly,</v>

226
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:52.383
<v Speaker 1>it's not like they're learning from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that we're learning together and </v>

227
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:59.470
<v Speaker 1>every time I solved one of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems or help them solve one of their</v>

228
00:12:59.471 --> 00:13:02.680
<v Speaker 1>problems are you help myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So of one of my problems,</v>

229
00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people bring to me,</v>

230
00:13:05.051 --> 00:13:05.884
<v Speaker 1>bring into my sessions the terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that go wrong with people in </v>

231
00:13:09.011 --> 00:13:11.200
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their partner has cancer,</v>

232
00:13:11.201 --> 00:13:15.010
<v Speaker 1>their father's father has Alzheimer's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're suffering with alcoholism.</v>

233
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:16.143
<v Speaker 1>Their career is collapsing like these </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't things that are happening to </v>

234
00:13:18.641 --> 00:13:19.474
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

235
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:20.523
<v Speaker 1>These are things that happen to everyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to figure out how to solve that for </v>

236
00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:26.170
<v Speaker 1>someone is to figure out how to solve it</v>
<v Speaker 1>for yourself.</v>

237
00:13:26.171 --> 00:13:30.920
<v Speaker 1>There's no difference whatsoever and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then so there's to know that to,</v>

238
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.490
<v Speaker 1>to think of that and certainly works in </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

239
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.440
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an intimate relationship.</v>

240
00:13:35.441 --> 00:13:39.130
<v Speaker 1>If you think that you're somehow </v>
<v Speaker 1>different than your wife,</v>

241
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:43.000
<v Speaker 1>while certainly she's going to remind </v>
<v Speaker 1>you otherwise constantly,</v>

242
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.620
<v Speaker 1>but it's an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an error.</v>

243
00:13:44.621 --> 00:13:45.454
<v Speaker 1>It's an error because you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're tied together so tightly that </v>

244
00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:50.463
<v Speaker 1>whatever happens to one inevitably </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to the other and that's true in </v>

245
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:59.110
<v Speaker 1>in the work reality that we all inhabit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the terror thing emerges.</v>

246
00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:01.083
<v Speaker 1>When you start to realize that those </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems that you don't address that or </v>

247
00:14:03.941 --> 00:14:08.941
<v Speaker 1>maybe magnified by your impulsive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>foolishly self centered and instrumental</v>

248
00:14:09.731 --> 00:14:10.564
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're manipulating the world on behalf </v>

249
00:14:12.221 --> 00:14:17.221
<v Speaker 1>of your own narrow interests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those will come back to haunt you and so</v>

250
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.890
<v Speaker 1>it's a terrifying thing to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>

251
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:23.440
<v Speaker 1>but once you think through and </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand it,</v>

252
00:14:23.441 --> 00:14:26.980
<v Speaker 1>then what happens is you're more afraid </v>
<v Speaker 1>of acting selfishly,</v>

253
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:29.980
<v Speaker 1>then you are willing to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

254
00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:31.060
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing that.</v>

255
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.730
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I know all hell will break loose</v>

256
00:14:33.731 --> 00:14:38.140
<v Speaker 1>if I do that and I'm not going there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the terror element is a huge one.</v>

257
00:14:38.141 --> 00:14:38.974
<v Speaker 1>It makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

258
00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:42.250
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it fortifies your because you can't just</v>

259
00:14:42.251 --> 00:14:45.220
<v Speaker 1>act</v>
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>

260
00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:47.500
<v Speaker 1>You don't have the moral fortitude for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

261
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:50.440
<v Speaker 1>You can aim it the good and run from </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's terrible.</v>

262
00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.130
<v Speaker 1>Then you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're motivated.</v>

263
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.400
<v Speaker 3>So if I've understood you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to recap,</v>

264
00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:59.180
<v Speaker 3>if you're suggesting a subsidiary with </v>
<v Speaker 3>your environment,</v>

265
00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:01.400
<v Speaker 3>not the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the few,</v>

266
00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.870
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reaching out to your environment.</v>

267
00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.160
<v Speaker 3>That's an expenditure of energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but rather as an investment.</v>

268
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:08.870
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an investment.</v>

269
00:15:08.871 --> 00:15:10.550
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good way of putting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

270
00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:14.630
<v Speaker 2>I was wondering if you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's plausible,</v>

271
00:15:14.631 --> 00:15:15.464
<v Speaker 2>it's race on our market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Typical or narrative origin for some of </v>

272
00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:19.203
<v Speaker 2>the intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 2>denied the structures of language as </v>

273
00:15:25.261 --> 00:15:29.940
<v Speaker 2>corresponds to reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Denied the psyche of the individual.</v>

274
00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:31.253
<v Speaker 2>I think you've done some of your top two</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you think is possible from a </v>

275
00:15:34.201 --> 00:15:37.830
<v Speaker 2>psychological perspective to trace the </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative,</v>

276
00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:40.920
<v Speaker 2>origin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodernism and human behavior,</v>

277
00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.660
<v Speaker 2>or is it so unnatural?</v>

278
00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:43.951
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

279
00:15:43.951 --> 00:15:44.350
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

280
00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:45.183
<v Speaker 1>It's an architect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>architect.</v>

281
00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:48.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always a forest,</v>

282
00:15:48.761 --> 00:15:50.020
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that opposes.</v>

283
00:15:50.021 --> 00:15:53.530
<v Speaker 1>The logo's always had that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the hostile brothers.</v>

284
00:15:53.531 --> 00:15:57.520
<v Speaker 1>It's a classic archetypal story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always cain and Abel.</v>

285
00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:02.200
<v Speaker 1>There's always hostility between the two</v>
<v Speaker 1>primary modes of operating in the world,</v>

286
00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:06.220
<v Speaker 1>so and this is the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the modern manifestation of that</v>

287
00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:08.650
<v Speaker 1>and it's partly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's partly a good thing.</v>

288
00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:13.150
<v Speaker 1>Maybe in some sense because it's useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be deeply challenged.</v>

289
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:17.290
<v Speaker 1>It's good to have an enemy because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>enemy makes you think.</v>

290
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:19.990
<v Speaker 1>The enemy tells you things that no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>else will tell you.</v>

291
00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:22.740
<v Speaker 1>It's a DNA and it's an advert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adversity.</v>

292
00:16:22.741 --> 00:16:24.460
<v Speaker 1>It's an ad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the adversary that,</v>

293
00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:25.410
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

294
00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:30.410
<v Speaker 1>that stops you from being merely inert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so postmodernism plays that role.</v>

295
00:16:30.941 --> 00:16:33.160
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's extraordinarily critical,</v>

296
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:38.230
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but things can go too far and and,</v>

297
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.970
<v Speaker 1>and the motives and things can go too </v>
<v Speaker 1>far when they go too far,</v>

298
00:16:42.971 --> 00:16:43.804
<v Speaker 1>they reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens and hopefully </v>

299
00:16:45.971 --> 00:16:48.190
<v Speaker 1>they're reversing now hopefully</v>

300
00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:56.603
<v Speaker 2>as being mainly associated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we seem to be seeing something that had </v>

301
00:17:02.431 --> 00:17:05.980
<v Speaker 2>a different form today that might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is more associated with the family.</v>

302
00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:07.713
<v Speaker 2>Can you speak to that and also what is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the nature of this power over men that </v>

303
00:17:12.941 --> 00:17:15.120
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be able to silence us.</v>

304
00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:18.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the question is,</v>

305
00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:20.243
<v Speaker 1>the totalitarian forms that we've seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>primarily in the past have been male </v>

306
00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:24.913
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe we're seeing something </v>

307
00:17:26.091 --> 00:17:29.540
<v Speaker 1>different now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't think it's different.</v>

308
00:17:29.541 --> 00:17:30.374
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's of the other common kind that's </v>

309
00:17:33.591 --> 00:17:37.550
<v Speaker 1>expanded in its dominion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you imagine that there's an essential</v>

310
00:17:37.551 --> 00:17:38.384
<v Speaker 1>feminine pathology just as there is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>essential masculine pathology and the </v>

311
00:17:42.921 --> 00:17:46.430
<v Speaker 1>essential feminine pathology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud mapped out it's the eternal mother</v>

312
00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:51.600
<v Speaker 1>and the mother is the mother that gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>too close to her children.</v>

313
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.290
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And intermingles herself with them too,</v>

314
00:17:54.291 --> 00:17:57.930
<v Speaker 1>too great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A degree that in her attempts to protect</v>

315
00:17:57.931 --> 00:17:58.764
<v Speaker 1>them undermines them fatally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a classic representation </v>

316
00:18:03.571 --> 00:18:04.404
<v Speaker 1>of the feminine in the West and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>classic representation is married and </v>

317
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.690
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's one of the representations.</v>

318
00:18:09.691 --> 00:18:10.524
<v Speaker 1>It's lovely and it's derived at least in</v>
<v Speaker 1>part from the story of Mary and the </v>

319
00:18:14.491 --> 00:18:15.690
<v Speaker 1>snake in the garden of Eden.</v>

320
00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:20.690
<v Speaker 1>And so Mary has her foot on a serpent </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she's holding Christ off to the side</v>

321
00:18:21.181 --> 00:18:22.500
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

322
00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:24.300
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what mothers have always </v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

323
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:25.703
<v Speaker 1>It's a biological portrait of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>women is they hold their infants out of </v>

324
00:18:29.971 --> 00:18:33.150
<v Speaker 1>the reach of the terrible Serpentine </v>
<v Speaker 1>Predator.</v>

325
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.990
<v Speaker 1>Obviously that's what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's fine,</v>

326
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.250
<v Speaker 1>but adults aren't infants and neither </v>
<v Speaker 1>are children.</v>

327
00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:45.090
<v Speaker 1>And if you treat them like they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you undermine them,</v>

328
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.390
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

329
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:48.720
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pathologize them,</v>

330
00:18:48.721 --> 00:18:52.560
<v Speaker 1>you turn them into old infants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an ugly thing.</v>

331
00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:55.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's the Friday a nightmare you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

332
00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:56.613
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this happens in therapy very </v>

333
00:18:58.201 --> 00:18:59.220
<v Speaker 1>frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

334
00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:01.980
<v Speaker 1>you can be tangled into a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with your father.</v>

335
00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:07.220
<v Speaker 1>That's often either because he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>absent or abusive or tyrannical.</v>

336
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:11.820
<v Speaker 1>Something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that the standard pathology with mom</v>

337
00:19:11.821 --> 00:19:14.950
<v Speaker 1>is she did everything for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

338
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:19.440
<v Speaker 1>what's left for you to do nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>including never leaving.</v>

339
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:24.223
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the motivation for the woman </v>

340
00:19:26.641 --> 00:19:30.780
<v Speaker 1>who's nothing but protective mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no role outside of nurturing,</v>

341
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:36.480
<v Speaker 1>of nurturing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nurturing,</v>

342
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:38.160
<v Speaker 1>of nurture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of infants,</v>

343
00:19:38.161 --> 00:19:39.390
<v Speaker 1>of nurturer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of infants.</v>

344
00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:40.561
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just keep them.</v>

345
00:19:40.561 --> 00:19:42.210
<v Speaker 1>Infants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll never leave.</v>

346
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:47.130
<v Speaker 1>It might kill you in your sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they'll never leave.</v>

347
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

348
00:19:50.761 --> 00:19:51.594
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's so comical watching the </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminist postmodernist in particular </v>

349
00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:56.243
<v Speaker 1>rattle on about the absence of gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality and act out the archetipal </v>

350
00:20:01.741 --> 00:20:06.150
<v Speaker 1>devouring mother at exactly the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time for them,</v>

351
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:07.703
<v Speaker 1>for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world is divided into predators and </v>

352
00:20:10.501 --> 00:20:11.334
<v Speaker 1>infants and the predators are evil and </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to be stopped and the infants need </v>

353
00:20:15.871 --> 00:20:18.360
<v Speaker 1>to be cared for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

354
00:20:18.361 --> 00:20:22.920
<v Speaker 1>that's what the mother does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but adults are not infants</v>

355
00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.940
<v Speaker 1>and all you do is destroy them when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>treat them that way,</v>

356
00:20:26.941 --> 00:20:29.640
<v Speaker 1>especially when they're adolescents and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just starting to develop.</v>

357
00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.540
<v Speaker 1>Now there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a rule that I attempted to abide</v>

358
00:20:33.541 --> 00:20:34.374
<v Speaker 1>by when I had small children and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rule was don't do anything for your </v>

359
00:20:38.401 --> 00:20:43.260
<v Speaker 1>children that they can do themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's annoying that rule because it takes</v>

360
00:20:43.261 --> 00:20:47.290
<v Speaker 1>you like 15 seconds to to dress a two </v>
<v Speaker 1>year old,</v>

361
00:20:47.291 --> 00:20:49.180
<v Speaker 1>but you let the two year old dress </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

362
00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:53.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like 15 minutes or 20 minutes or </v>
<v Speaker 1>half an hour.</v>

363
00:20:53.651 --> 00:20:54.484
<v Speaker 1>You chase them around the house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you let them learn to dress </v>

364
00:20:57.011 --> 00:20:58.780
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you don't have to dress themselves.</v>

365
00:20:58.781 --> 00:20:59.614
<v Speaker 1>Any direct dress them anymore and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do it and you do that with setting </v>

366
00:21:02.411 --> 00:21:04.090
<v Speaker 1>the table and you do that with </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

367
00:21:04.091 --> 00:21:04.781
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

368
00:21:04.781 --> 00:21:05.614
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do that now while I care for you so </v>

369
00:21:07.301 --> 00:21:08.530
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me do that for you.</v>

370
00:21:08.531 --> 00:21:09.364
<v Speaker 1>It's like I don't care for you at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I say that I don't care for you at </v>

371
00:21:12.071 --> 00:21:12.904
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stop doing everything I </v>

372
00:21:14.081 --> 00:21:17.410
<v Speaker 1>possibly can for you as rapidly as I </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly can say,</v>

373
00:21:17.411 --> 00:21:18.101
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>

374
00:21:18.101 --> 00:21:18.934
<v Speaker 1>That's how you work in an old age home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do not do anything for the inhabitants </v>

375
00:21:24.101 --> 00:21:24.934
<v Speaker 1>that they can do themselves because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>robbed them of the last vestiges of </v>

376
00:21:27.011 --> 00:21:27.940
<v Speaker 1>their independence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

377
00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.550
<v Speaker 1>It's what you do when you're a manager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a good manager,</v>

378
00:21:30.551 --> 00:21:31.384
<v Speaker 1>you make yourself superfluous by </v>
<v Speaker 1>extending autonomy and independence to </v>

379
00:21:35.891 --> 00:21:38.980
<v Speaker 1>the people that you manage so that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can take over the whole job.</v>

380
00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.173
<v Speaker 1>You don't do that by doing everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>for people and you certainly don't do </v>

381
00:21:43.091 --> 00:21:43.924
<v Speaker 1>that by dividing the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypically and uncritically into </v>

382
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.980
<v Speaker 1>predators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those who have more and victims,</v>

383
00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:51.873
<v Speaker 1>infants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those who have nothing and acting like </v>

384
00:21:53.951 --> 00:21:56.740
<v Speaker 1>all you can ever do is protect them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Protect.</v>

385
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:58.300
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't protect people.</v>

386
00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.790
<v Speaker 1>You can only make them strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

387
00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:01.773
<v Speaker 1>You cannot protect them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make them strong and then they </v>

388
00:22:04.271 --> 00:22:06.520
<v Speaker 1>can predict themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they don't need you.</v>

389
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's the underground pathological</v>

390
00:22:09.971 --> 00:22:11.920
<v Speaker 1>elements of the devouring mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

391
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:13.360
<v Speaker 1>never leave me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the deal.</v>

392
00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:16.570
<v Speaker 1>I'll do everything for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just never leave,</v>

393
00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:19.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's sleeping with your mother,</v>

394
00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:20.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

395
00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.240
<v Speaker 1>That's the Friday a nightmare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

396
00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.490
<v Speaker 1>You don't invite your child into your </v>
<v Speaker 1>bed,</v>

397
00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You distinguished between them and you,</v>

398
00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:28.613
<v Speaker 1>you distinguish between them and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>husband and you facilitate their </v>

399
00:22:31.841 --> 00:22:32.674
<v Speaker 1>independence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A part of the reason why it's useful to </v>

400
00:22:35.051 --> 00:22:35.884
<v Speaker 1>have a mother and a father is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mother has to fall insanely in love </v>

401
00:22:38.891 --> 00:22:40.930
<v Speaker 1>with the infant or she'd throw it out </v>
<v Speaker 1>the window,</v>

402
00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:42.003
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're.</v>

403
00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.890
<v Speaker 1>They're insanely demanding and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>always right,</v>

404
00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.293
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the right way to treat an </v>

405
00:22:46.871 --> 00:22:49.390
<v Speaker 1>infant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially before nine months is I'll do</v>

406
00:22:49.391 --> 00:22:51.640
<v Speaker 1>everything for you and you're always </v>
<v Speaker 1>right in your needs.</v>

407
00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:55.090
<v Speaker 1>Take priority over everyone's at one </v>
<v Speaker 1>else's and anybody that threatens you is</v>

408
00:22:55.091 --> 00:22:56.890
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly right,</v>

409
00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:00.820
<v Speaker 1>but after once the kid is ambulatory and</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to be independent,</v>

410
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.530
<v Speaker 1>that's the wrong attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The attitude then is no,</v>

411
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.073
<v Speaker 1>get the hell on with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and men who are less prone to negative </v>

412
00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:10.654
<v Speaker 1>emotion and less compassionate are much </v>
<v Speaker 1>better at fostering that kind of </v>

413
00:23:14.141 --> 00:23:18.070
<v Speaker 1>independence and so it's usually then </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they step into the family and start</v>

414
00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:19.083
<v Speaker 1>playing with the kids rough and tumble </v>
<v Speaker 1>play and pushing them forward and </v>

415
00:23:22.421 --> 00:23:23.254
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

416
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:24.070
<v Speaker 1>get on with it.</v>

417
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:26.170
<v Speaker 1>You can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do it at home.</v>

418
00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.350
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard for a mother to play both</v>
<v Speaker 1>those rules because she has to fall,</v>

419
00:23:29.351 --> 00:23:32.470
<v Speaker 1>so in love with her infant that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult for her to be young,</v>

420
00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.410
<v Speaker 1>universal caregiver and disciplinarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time,</v>

421
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:36.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the roles are the roles run </v>

422
00:23:37.601 --> 00:23:38.434
<v Speaker 1>contrary to one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now women have entered the political </v>

423
00:23:40.031 --> 00:23:40.864
<v Speaker 1>sphere right on moss and so they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna bring their essential nature with </v>

424
00:23:44.441 --> 00:23:47.960
<v Speaker 1>them all the while saying there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>such thing as essential nature.</v>

425
00:23:47.961 --> 00:23:48.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

426
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:49.603
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>

427
00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:54.143
<v Speaker 2>Can we grow by the state of Western </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization using the new chain idea </v>

428
00:23:57.791 --> 00:23:58.840
<v Speaker 2>that God is dead?</v>

429
00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.473
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the wrong question in some sense </v>

430
00:24:02.971 --> 00:24:07.380
<v Speaker 1>because I think it's too diffuse to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They issue Morris,</v>

431
00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.513
<v Speaker 1>do you have problems in your life that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not addressing that you could </v>

432
00:24:11.401 --> 00:24:13.710
<v Speaker 1>solve?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is yes,</v>

433
00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:17.400
<v Speaker 1>and it's an easy thing to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sit on your bed one morning and say,</v>

434
00:24:17.401 --> 00:24:20.430
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some things that need to be done</v>

435
00:24:20.431 --> 00:24:25.020
<v Speaker 1>that I don't want to do that I could do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would make things better by the end</v>

436
00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.400
<v Speaker 1>of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they?</v>

437
00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:27.653
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

438
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:28.823
<v Speaker 1>your conscience will deliver those </v>
<v Speaker 1>soccer's no time flat now and then you </v>

439
00:24:32.071 --> 00:24:32.910
<v Speaker 1>might have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

440
00:24:32.911 --> 00:24:37.911
<v Speaker 1>well how do I entice myself into doing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>few of those and if you ask,</v>

441
00:24:38.221 --> 00:24:39.054
<v Speaker 1>instead of trying to force yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it like you're a tyrant and a slave </v>

442
00:24:42.121 --> 00:24:42.954
<v Speaker 1>at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can usually negotiate with yourself </v>

443
00:24:45.121 --> 00:24:48.000
<v Speaker 1>so that you'll start to sort those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things out,</v>

444
00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:49.403
<v Speaker 1>sort them out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put your house in order and then move </v>

445
00:24:52.201 --> 00:24:54.460
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Move on and out.</v>

446
00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a 40 and slipped by the way.</v>

447
00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:06.550
<v Speaker 1>So it's important because the thing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a practice domain right there.</v>

448
00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:10.530
<v Speaker 1>There are things that are within your </v>
<v Speaker 1>grasp that you couldn't fix.</v>

449
00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:14.820
<v Speaker 1>Fix them and you'll learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll learn because it's harder than it</v>

450
00:25:14.821 --> 00:25:15.654
<v Speaker 1>looks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fixed them and you'll learn how to fix </v>

451
00:25:17.131 --> 00:25:20.850
<v Speaker 1>things and then something else will </v>
<v Speaker 1>beckon as another problem that you could</v>

452
00:25:20.851 --> 00:25:23.910
<v Speaker 1>fix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you all have your problems.</v>

453
00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:24.893
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's an infinite number of </v>

454
00:25:26.101 --> 00:25:28.140
<v Speaker 1>problems in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them happened to be yours.</v>

455
00:25:28.141 --> 00:25:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly,</v>

456
00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:32.940
<v Speaker 1>but you have your problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

457
00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Solve them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

458
00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:36.750
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I learned as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapist,</v>

459
00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:37.593
<v Speaker 1>every therapist has to learn this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things you wonder </v>

460
00:25:40.591 --> 00:25:41.424
<v Speaker 1>when you're first starting to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinician is how do you not take the </v>

461
00:25:44.311 --> 00:25:46.350
<v Speaker 1>catastrophes of your client's home with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

462
00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.680
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>immoral to.</v>

463
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:55.570
<v Speaker 1>They're not your problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're their problems like their,</v>

464
00:25:55.571 --> 00:25:56.670
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their life.</v>

465
00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.590
<v Speaker 1>You all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your problems are your life.</v>

466
00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:59.543
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to solve someone else's </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems for them because you take away </v>

467
00:26:02.101 --> 00:26:02.934
<v Speaker 1>the deep meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's to be found in having them work </v>

468
00:26:06.151 --> 00:26:09.120
<v Speaker 1>through the problems on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you steal the credit.</v>

469
00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:10.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can help you with that.</v>

470
00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:12.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

471
00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:13.560
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

472
00:26:13.561 --> 00:26:15.780
<v Speaker 1>but I don't help you with the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

473
00:26:15.781 --> 00:26:17.970
<v Speaker 1>Then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in any case,</v>

474
00:26:17.971 --> 00:26:21.480
<v Speaker 1>you sort sort out the problems that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>right in front of you and you will,</v>

475
00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.553
<v Speaker 1>it will make you grow very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly and then you'll be able to </v>

476
00:26:24.601 --> 00:26:27.210
<v Speaker 1>sort out more complex problems without </v>
<v Speaker 1>making them worse.</v>

477
00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:28.733
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

478
00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:33.330
<v Speaker 2>So you mentioned that through discussion</v>
<v Speaker 2>and dialogue,</v>

479
00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:35.730
<v Speaker 2>we can order the chaos of the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

480
00:26:35.731 --> 00:26:38.070
<v Speaker 2>But do you not think that there needs to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a higher creator,</v>

481
00:26:38.071 --> 00:26:41.940
<v Speaker 2>an essence of grace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it would be possible like how can we</v>

482
00:26:41.941 --> 00:26:44.370
<v Speaker 2>each being flawed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even working together</v>

483
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:46.020
<v Speaker 4>create meaning or something good?</v>

484
00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:57.203
<v Speaker 4>We don't understand what we are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't understand our own </v>

485
00:27:00.831 --> 00:27:01.664
<v Speaker 4>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has a quality of some sort and it </v>

486
00:27:04.971 --> 00:27:08.450
<v Speaker 4>meant it manifests itself within us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an orientation towards the good.</v>

487
00:27:08.451 --> 00:27:10.100
<v Speaker 4>That might be one way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

488
00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:11.473
<v Speaker 4>freedom to do evil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but an orientation towards the good and </v>

489
00:27:13.941 --> 00:27:18.380
<v Speaker 4>so you participate in whatever that </v>
<v Speaker 4>transcendent element of you is while you</v>

490
00:27:18.381 --> 00:27:21.440
<v Speaker 4>try to speak the truth and sort out the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

491
00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:26.740
<v Speaker 4>It serves as a guide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I know that you're making a,</v>

492
00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:31.340
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a query about some transcendent reality.</v>

493
00:27:31.341 --> 00:27:32.174
<v Speaker 4>Maybe the transcendent reality of God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's the best answer you're going </v>

494
00:27:35.301 --> 00:27:39.500
<v Speaker 4>to get out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

495
00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.270
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two questions.</v>

496
00:27:47.271 --> 00:27:48.104
<v Speaker 4>What's my opinion on the alt right and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's my opinion on cultural </v>

497
00:27:50.271 --> 00:27:51.104
<v Speaker 4>appropriation?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea of cultural appropriation is </v>

498
00:27:53.091 --> 00:27:54.230
<v Speaker 4>absolute nonsense.</v>

499
00:27:55.180 --> 00:28:00.180
<v Speaker 5>That's that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

500
00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:02.253
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no difference between cultural </v>

501
00:28:03.701 --> 00:28:05.590
<v Speaker 4>appropriation and learning from one </v>
<v Speaker 4>another.</v>

502
00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:07.810
<v Speaker 4>They're the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

503
00:28:07.811 --> 00:28:08.644
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't mean I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't mean that there's no theft </v>

504
00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:14.540
<v Speaker 4>between people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is no,</v>

505
00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:18.340
<v Speaker 4>and it doesn't mean that just because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you encounter someone else's ideas,</v>

506
00:28:18.341 --> 00:28:21.490
<v Speaker 4>you have an immediate right to those </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas as if they were your own.</v>

507
00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:26.560
<v Speaker 4>But the idea that manifesting in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>own behavior,</v>

508
00:28:26.561 --> 00:28:27.394
<v Speaker 4>some element of another culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea that that's somehow immoral is </v>

509
00:28:30.191 --> 00:28:33.450
<v Speaker 4>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's actually one of the bases of peace.</v>

510
00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:34.513
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that the various </v>

511
00:28:35.771 --> 00:28:36.604
<v Speaker 4>groups of human beings that exist have </v>
<v Speaker 4>to offer each other is the tremendous </v>

512
00:28:39.581 --> 00:28:41.890
<v Speaker 4>value of their culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

513
00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.110
<v Speaker 4>it's been really interesting to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

514
00:28:44.111 --> 00:28:48.520
<v Speaker 4>to watch the response of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of all of everyone,</v>

515
00:28:48.521 --> 00:28:52.150
<v Speaker 4>but for this argument to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for young Caucasian males to hip hop,</v>

516
00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:53.793
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an aggressiveness about hip hop </v>

517
00:28:54.941 --> 00:28:55.774
<v Speaker 4>that's really attractive to young </v>
<v Speaker 4>Caucasian males and there's something </v>

518
00:28:57.521 --> 00:28:59.650
<v Speaker 4>absurd about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about the,</v>

519
00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:00.783
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the spectacle of the young Caucasian </v>

520
00:29:03.671 --> 00:29:07.900
<v Speaker 4>males taking on the persona of inner </v>
<v Speaker 4>city black gang members.</v>

521
00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:09.540
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

522
00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:13.450
<v Speaker 4>but I'm sympathetic to it because </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an aggressiveness to that,</v>

523
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:14.583
<v Speaker 4>to that art form that's a necessary </v>
<v Speaker 4>corrective to the insistence that the </v>

524
00:29:19.691 --> 00:29:22.930
<v Speaker 4>highest moral virtue for a modern man is</v>
<v Speaker 4>harmlessness,</v>

525
00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:26.620
<v Speaker 4>which is observed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Women don't even like harmless man.</v>

526
00:29:26.621 --> 00:29:28.280
<v Speaker 4>They hate them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They liked that.</v>

527
00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:33.750
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What women</v>

528
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:38.750
<v Speaker 4>want are dangerous men who are civilized</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they want to help civilize them.</v>

529
00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:42.140
<v Speaker 4>That's beauty and the beast.</v>

530
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:43.341
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

531
00:29:43.341 --> 00:29:44.174
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you a funny story and only </v>
<v Speaker 4>engineers could have come up with this </v>

532
00:29:46.461 --> 00:29:47.294
<v Speaker 4>because they are the only ones that have</v>
<v Speaker 4>the unparalleled blindness to social </v>

533
00:29:51.351 --> 00:29:53.480
<v Speaker 4>convention that would allow them to </v>
<v Speaker 4>discover it.</v>

534
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:54.583
<v Speaker 4>So the Google engineers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like engineers by the way because </v>

535
00:29:56.811 --> 00:29:59.840
<v Speaker 4>they're very straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Google engineers wrote a book awhile</v>

536
00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:04.340
<v Speaker 4>back called a billion wicked thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was a study of Internet searches,</v>

537
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:05.263
<v Speaker 4>billions of them literally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they were looking a lot of </v>

538
00:30:07.161 --> 00:30:07.994
<v Speaker 4>pornography use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And while there's lots of known about </v>

539
00:30:09.651 --> 00:30:12.530
<v Speaker 4>male pornography use,</v>
<v Speaker 4>partly and it's easy to understand.</v>

540
00:30:12.531 --> 00:30:13.364
<v Speaker 4>I mean males are pretty visually </v>
<v Speaker 4>oriented in what attracts them to </v>

541
00:30:17.091 --> 00:30:17.924
<v Speaker 4>pornography is fairly straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can tell that if you look at </v>

542
00:30:21.561 --> 00:30:22.394
<v Speaker 4>graffiti and a men's washroom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know it's like two circles and the </v>

543
00:30:25.521 --> 00:30:28.280
<v Speaker 4>triangle and the men are absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 4>transfixed.</v>

544
00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:29.993
<v Speaker 5>Bye</v>

545
00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:47.180
<v Speaker 4>For women in the story is more complex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They use pornography too,</v>

546
00:30:47.181 --> 00:30:48.014
<v Speaker 4>but it tends to be literary because </v>
<v Speaker 4>women tend to like words more than they </v>

547
00:30:50.181 --> 00:30:51.014
<v Speaker 4>like visual stimuli.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the Google guys tried to track </v>

548
00:30:53.331 --> 00:30:54.164
<v Speaker 4>down the architectural structure of how </v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't use those words of female </v>

549
00:30:57.321 --> 00:30:58.154
<v Speaker 4>pornography use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so some of you know how many of you </v>

550
00:31:00.981 --> 00:31:04.290
<v Speaker 4>know what a Harlequin romance is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

551
00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:06.170
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So those are archetypal stories,</v>

552
00:31:06.171 --> 00:31:08.150
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the taming of the wild man.</v>

553
00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:11.120
<v Speaker 4>Essentially by the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the desirable in virgin a woman.</v>

554
00:31:11.121 --> 00:31:15.170
<v Speaker 4>And if you think women don't want that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you better bloody well come up with</v>

555
00:31:15.171 --> 00:31:18.290
<v Speaker 4>an explanation for 50 shades of grey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

556
00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:19.183
<v Speaker 4>Which is the most,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most rapid selling novel in human </v>

557
00:31:21.141 --> 00:31:24.380
<v Speaker 4>history and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and merged at exactly the same time that</v>

558
00:31:24.381 --> 00:31:25.214
<v Speaker 4>all of this noise about the lack of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>absence of gender roles is being </v>

559
00:31:28.161 --> 00:31:29.530
<v Speaker 4>produced on Mohs.</v>

560
00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:32.990
<v Speaker 4>It's like perfect female fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's exactly archetypally correct.</v>

561
00:31:32.991 --> 00:31:33.824
<v Speaker 4>It's beauty and the beast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what the dual guys showed was the </v>

562
00:31:37.311 --> 00:31:38.144
<v Speaker 4>structure of beauty and the beast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although they didn't use that as a </v>

563
00:31:39.681 --> 00:31:43.940
<v Speaker 4>reference that the female pornographic </v>
<v Speaker 4>fantasy was wild guy,</v>

564
00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:45.853
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhat careless about the wants and </v>

565
00:31:47.301 --> 00:31:49.670
<v Speaker 4>desires of others attractive to </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone.</v>

566
00:31:49.671 --> 00:31:50.930
<v Speaker 4>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>high status,</v>

567
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:55.070
<v Speaker 4>tamed by the magic of a single woman and</v>
<v Speaker 4>brought into a relationship with her.</v>

568
00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:56.061
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

569
00:31:56.061 --> 00:31:58.490
<v Speaker 4>but here's the comical part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This just made me laugh,</v>

570
00:31:58.520 --> 00:31:59.353
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

571
00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:00.283
<v Speaker 4>what were the five categories of most </v>
<v Speaker 4>desirable male entity used most broadly </v>

572
00:32:05.031 --> 00:32:06.930
<v Speaker 4>and female pornography.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

573
00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.270
<v Speaker 4>it's so embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Women,</v>

574
00:32:08.271 --> 00:32:13.271
<v Speaker 4>you have to cover your head while I say </v>
<v Speaker 4>this because Vampire Werewolf,</v>

575
00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:20.180
<v Speaker 4>billionaire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>surgeon and pirate.</v>

576
00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:36.270
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Another question.</v>

577
00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.313
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

578
00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:42.003
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

579
00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:45.423
<v Speaker 4>I hear a lot</v>

580
00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:49.890
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to drag you back to Yelp,</v>

581
00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:50.773
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

582
00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.433
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

583
00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:57.480
<v Speaker 2>What the</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have right now and now the core is to</v>

584
00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:00.223
<v Speaker 2>believe in ethnic nationalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not the sort of oppositional </v>

585
00:33:04.661 --> 00:33:09.030
<v Speaker 2>nationalism that we all know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more of a rag salt or,</v>

586
00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:14.310
<v Speaker 2>or do gyn universal nationalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think this core belief of the alt</v>

587
00:33:14.631 --> 00:33:17.480
<v Speaker 2>right is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it logical?</v>

588
00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:18.740
<v Speaker 2>Is it revenue?</v>

589
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:20.583
<v Speaker 4>Complete,</v>
<v Speaker 4>complete identification with the father </v>

590
00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:26.593
<v Speaker 4>and that's necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the purpose of identification with </v>

591
00:33:29.241 --> 00:33:31.970
<v Speaker 4>the father is to become the son,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

592
00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:32.923
<v Speaker 4>and I mean that in all of its symbolic </v>
<v Speaker 4>manifestation and the problem with </v>

593
00:33:37.641 --> 00:33:38.474
<v Speaker 4>nationalism is that it forgets that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>forgets that the purpose of the nation </v>

594
00:33:41.001 --> 00:33:44.230
<v Speaker 4>is to give rise to the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

595
00:33:44.231 --> 00:33:47.600
<v Speaker 4>and what's happened now because our </v>
<v Speaker 4>identities have become fragmented,</v>

596
00:33:47.601 --> 00:33:51.980
<v Speaker 4>is that there's a call to re constitute </v>
<v Speaker 4>the father and that's.</v>

597
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:54.080
<v Speaker 4>And that's at the core of the alt right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking.</v>

598
00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.810
<v Speaker 4>Well that's the benevolent part of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>alt right.</v>

599
00:33:56.811 --> 00:33:59.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a downside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a negative side to everything.</v>

600
00:33:59.501 --> 00:34:00.334
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that's quite </v>

601
00:34:00.951 --> 00:34:03.240
<v Speaker 4>disturbing about the alt right is it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>pro click,</v>

602
00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:06.320
<v Speaker 4>continual proclivity to degenerate into </v>
<v Speaker 4>anti Semitism.</v>

603
00:34:06.321 --> 00:34:08.390
<v Speaker 4>And I see that in the comments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

604
00:34:08.391 --> 00:34:13.270
<v Speaker 4>on my videos continually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's oversimplified and there's a,</v>

605
00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.113
<v Speaker 4>there's a terror,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's also no true recognition or not </v>

606
00:34:17.391 --> 00:34:18.224
<v Speaker 4>sufficient recognition that the state is</v>
<v Speaker 4>also a pathological monster and the all </v>

607
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:22.833
<v Speaker 4>right should understand that because of </v>
<v Speaker 4>course that's what the left continually </v>

608
00:34:25.131 --> 00:34:26.180
<v Speaker 4>claims,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

609
00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:28.640
<v Speaker 4>The state is a pathological monster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

610
00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:30.040
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to produce.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry,</v>

611
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:31.640
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the left is trying to produce.</v>

612
00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:32.803
<v Speaker 4>I got that wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the basis of the alt right's </v>

613
00:34:35.361 --> 00:34:36.194
<v Speaker 4>criticism of the left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The old right says the left is trying </v>

614
00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.553
<v Speaker 4>always trying to expand the dominion of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the state and the state is a </v>

615
00:34:42.321 --> 00:34:43.154
<v Speaker 4>pathological monster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yet what we should do is become </v>

616
00:34:45.051 --> 00:34:46.430
<v Speaker 4>nationalists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>

617
00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:48.890
<v Speaker 4>sorry guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a bit of a paradox there.</v>

618
00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:50.780
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

619
00:34:50.781 --> 00:34:51.614
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's basically what I would say </v>

620
00:34:53.151 --> 00:34:55.290
<v Speaker 4>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not surprising and,</v>

621
00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:58.670
<v Speaker 4>and as long as the radical left keeps </v>
<v Speaker 4>pushing the way they keep pushing,</v>

622
00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:00.620
<v Speaker 4>then all right is going to continue to </v>
<v Speaker 4>grow.</v>

623
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:01.603
<v Speaker 4>Although it's very also very difficult </v>
<v Speaker 4>to tell at now to what degree to how </v>

624
00:35:06.171 --> 00:35:09.380
<v Speaker 4>large the movement is or how serious it </v>
<v Speaker 4>is or any of those things at the moment.</v>

625
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:10.543
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

626
00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:14.080
<v Speaker 6>so just to bring you back to cultural </v>
<v Speaker 6>appropriation,</v>

627
00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:15.483
<v Speaker 6>is it possible that that plus about half</v>
<v Speaker 6>a dozen other similar things that </v>

628
00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:19.963
<v Speaker 6>appeared in the last 10 years rather </v>
<v Speaker 6>than be kind of like an empty or or </v>

629
00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:25.683
<v Speaker 6>ridiculous baseless philosophy are in </v>
<v Speaker 6>fact tactical tactical constructs by </v>

630
00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:31.923
<v Speaker 6>postmodernist and in March there's think</v>
<v Speaker 6>tanks we evidence for that would be in </v>

631
00:35:35.741 --> 00:35:38.700
<v Speaker 6>the fact that they are always </v>
<v Speaker 6>selectively</v>

632
00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:43.700
<v Speaker 4>enforced in a way which is the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>destructive possible to our occurrences.</v>

633
00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:45.030
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's,</v>

634
00:35:45.031 --> 00:35:46.440
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

635
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:48.630
<v Speaker 4>that kind of opens the broader question </v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

636
00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:51.810
<v Speaker 4>of conspiratorial action among political</v>
<v Speaker 4>groups,</v>

637
00:35:51.811 --> 00:35:54.090
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So here's a way of thinking about it.</v>

638
00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:58.950
<v Speaker 4>And I think this works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in any coherent philosophy,</v>

639
00:35:58.951 --> 00:35:59.784
<v Speaker 4>there's an impetus to action.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's partly what makes the philosophy </v>

640
00:36:02.551 --> 00:36:03.384
<v Speaker 4>coherent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And postmodernism is a coherent </v>

641
00:36:05.491 --> 00:36:07.350
<v Speaker 4>philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has an impetus to action.</v>

642
00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:08.513
<v Speaker 4>Now it's very difficult to describe the </v>
<v Speaker 4>entire structure of postmodernism </v>

643
00:36:13.561 --> 00:36:16.320
<v Speaker 4>because it's fuzzy at the edges.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It bleeds into other things.</v>

644
00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:19.030
<v Speaker 4>But imagine that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a core of,</v>

645
00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:20.473
<v Speaker 4>there's a core of central concerns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now imagine that most people who are </v>

646
00:36:23.401 --> 00:36:27.600
<v Speaker 4>normally postmodernists only understand </v>
<v Speaker 4>fragments of that core concern,</v>

647
00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:33.170
<v Speaker 4>and so if you take the typical </v>
<v Speaker 4>indoctrinated social justice warrior,</v>

648
00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:36.690
<v Speaker 4>Third Year Women's studies student,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might say,</v>

649
00:36:36.691 --> 00:36:37.524
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's only 15 percent postmodernist and </v>

650
00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:45.570
<v Speaker 4>85 percent still human,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so but if you get,</v>

651
00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:49.080
<v Speaker 4>if you get 10 people like that together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 people like that together,</v>

652
00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:50.813
<v Speaker 4>each,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's enough of the postmodernist </v>

653
00:36:52.531 --> 00:36:53.364
<v Speaker 4>doctrine that fills the room because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fragmented into different people </v>

654
00:36:57.030 --> 00:37:02.030
<v Speaker 4>that you have a coherent spirit that </v>
<v Speaker 4>animates the group and it will act as if</v>

655
00:37:02.581 --> 00:37:03.414
<v Speaker 4>it has the intelligence of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>philosophy and it will manifest itself </v>

656
00:37:06.571 --> 00:37:08.280
<v Speaker 4>as if it's conspiratorial.</v>

657
00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:09.443
<v Speaker 4>Now there are elements that are also </v>
<v Speaker 4>conspiratorial because people do things </v>

658
00:37:12.241 --> 00:37:15.200
<v Speaker 4>consciously as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you should always assume,</v>

659
00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:18.810
<v Speaker 4>assume stupidity before you assume </v>
<v Speaker 4>organized malevolence.</v>

660
00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:21.690
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

661
00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:24.563
<v Speaker 4>It keeps you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It keeps your thinking player because </v>

662
00:37:26.701 --> 00:37:27.534
<v Speaker 4>it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like there's no such thing as </v>

663
00:37:29.311 --> 00:37:30.144
<v Speaker 4>organized malevolence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's rare and it requires a lot of </v>

664
00:37:32.941 --> 00:37:33.774
<v Speaker 4>skill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas sort of distributed stupidity </v>

665
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.360
<v Speaker 4>that can act conspiratorially without </v>
<v Speaker 4>having to have a central agent.</v>

666
00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:43.920
<v Speaker 4>And so look there first and then and </v>
<v Speaker 4>only with great evidence,</v>

667
00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:46.710
<v Speaker 4>make the next set of presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

668
00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:03.040
<v Speaker 2>I first found out about you on which</v>
<v Speaker 2>uses it</v>

669
00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:11.890
<v Speaker 2>for that</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason,</v>

670
00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:17.460
<v Speaker 2>people feel like they can say anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

671
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:22.510
<v Speaker 2>maybe something is lost because on </v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook when your reputation is tied to</v>

672
00:38:22.971 --> 00:38:25.760
<v Speaker 2>all the opinions that you feel like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>might want to test out,</v>

673
00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:27.680
<v Speaker 2>but on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a place where it's anonymous,</v>

674
00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:28.723
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's dark and you have an international </v>

675
00:38:30.771 --> 00:38:32.030
<v Speaker 2>appeal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have this,</v>

676
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:33.143
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I started at Jordan Peterson spread </v>

677
00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:35.853
<v Speaker 2>within five minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got people from 10 different </v>

678
00:38:37.571 --> 00:38:38.404
<v Speaker 2>countries or countries that aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have English as their main </v>

679
00:38:42.311 --> 00:38:44.410
<v Speaker 2>language are joining in and talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

680
00:38:44.411 --> 00:38:47.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the man who yells out the emperor has no</v>

681
00:38:47.291 --> 00:38:48.124
<v Speaker 2>clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know we talked about how archetypes </v>

682
00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:54.490
<v Speaker 2>seems to manifest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you at</v>

683
00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:02.910
<v Speaker 4>that is actually not me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's my wife</v>

684
00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:06.230
<v Speaker 4>because she knows what I am and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

685
00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:08.870
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not all that great,</v>

686
00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:09.713
<v Speaker 4>but all things considered</v>

687
00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.830
<v Speaker 2>architectural point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what has manifested?</v>

688
00:39:14.831 --> 00:39:16.600
<v Speaker 2>What are you in embodying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems to.</v>

689
00:39:16.601 --> 00:39:17.434
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't need to see your real ugly </v>

690
00:39:18.341 --> 00:39:19.174
<v Speaker 2>face,</v>

691
00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:31.640
<v Speaker 4>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

692
00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:38.250
<v Speaker 4>I told you the story at the beginning of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the lecture.</v>

693
00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:43.610
<v Speaker 4>I've been trying to solve a problem and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I really done everything I can to try to</v>

694
00:39:44.311 --> 00:39:45.144
<v Speaker 4>solve that problem and I've been talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about what I learned and who I learned </v>

695
00:39:49.441 --> 00:39:51.030
<v Speaker 4>it from for 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

696
00:39:51.031 --> 00:39:54.930
<v Speaker 4>and that's had a positive impact as far </v>
<v Speaker 4>as I can tell them,</v>

697
00:39:54.931 --> 00:39:59.750
<v Speaker 4>the people to whom I've taught it and so</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

698
00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:03.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm someone who's tried to solve the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hardest problem that he could find.</v>

699
00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:05.460
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's all.</v>

700
00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:10.630
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

701
00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:15.250
<v Speaker 2>Do you think individuals today should </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a,</v>

702
00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.133
<v Speaker 2>a viewed relationship with religion and </v>
<v Speaker 2>God to kind of rebuild the moral </v>

703
00:40:21.661 --> 00:40:23.940
<v Speaker 2>authority that's been lost?</v>

704
00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.500
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

705
00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:27.523
<v Speaker 4>I think the question was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do I think that modern people should </v>

706
00:40:29.681 --> 00:40:32.200
<v Speaker 4>have a renewed relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 4>religion and God?</v>

707
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:33.011
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

708
00:40:33.011 --> 00:40:35.440
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it has to be predicated on,</v>

709
00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:38.170
<v Speaker 4>on higher consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so to speak,</v>

710
00:40:38.171 --> 00:40:39.970
<v Speaker 4>and I mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that very technically.</v>

711
00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:41.963
<v Speaker 4>So this is what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is how our religious systems </v>

712
00:40:44.051 --> 00:40:46.870
<v Speaker 4>developed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you the very brief version.</v>

713
00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:50.710
<v Speaker 4>So if you look at the structure of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>chimpanzee troop or a wolf pack,</v>

714
00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:51.963
<v Speaker 4>there's an ethic and there has to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>because otherwise the wolves would tear </v>

715
00:40:54.641 --> 00:40:56.680
<v Speaker 4>each other apart and so with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>chimpanzees.</v>

716
00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:57.523
<v Speaker 4>So the chimpanzees in their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in their dominance hierarchy structure </v>

717
00:41:00.871 --> 00:41:04.840
<v Speaker 4>is learn how to act out a society just </v>
<v Speaker 4>like the wool stoop.</v>

718
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:05.823
<v Speaker 4>So here's a rule for a wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wolfej wants to be top dog and wolf be </v>

719
00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:11.560
<v Speaker 4>wants to be top dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they,</v>

720
00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:12.553
<v Speaker 4>they snarl at each other and they puff </v>
<v Speaker 4>out their funnel and they look big and </v>

721
00:41:14.441 --> 00:41:16.720
<v Speaker 4>ferocious and they turned sideways to </v>
<v Speaker 4>scare each other.</v>

722
00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:19.450
<v Speaker 4>And then one of them chickens out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rolls over and shows his neck.</v>

723
00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:22.810
<v Speaker 4>And basically that is the acting out of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

724
00:41:22.811 --> 00:41:23.644
<v Speaker 4>I'm a useless applicant and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your majesty can do what he will with </v>

725
00:41:27.341 --> 00:41:30.040
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the proper wolf king says,</v>

726
00:41:30.041 --> 00:41:30.874
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I might need your useless carcass </v>

727
00:41:32.651 --> 00:41:36.020
<v Speaker 4>to hold down a moose tomorrow so I </v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't tear out your throat,</v>

728
00:41:36.021 --> 00:41:36.854
<v Speaker 4>but I won't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they both get up and go along </v>

729
00:41:38.781 --> 00:41:39.614
<v Speaker 4>in the pack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the reason I'm telling you that </v>

730
00:41:40.701 --> 00:41:43.580
<v Speaker 4>is because there's an ethic there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's another ethic among animals.</v>

731
00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:47.480
<v Speaker 4>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you take juvenile male rats,</v>

732
00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:49.093
<v Speaker 4>they need to play,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they need to engage in rough and tumble </v>

733
00:41:51.291 --> 00:41:54.260
<v Speaker 4>play or they develop attention deficit </v>
<v Speaker 4>disorder by the way,</v>

734
00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:55.183
<v Speaker 4>which is quite interesting and something</v>
<v Speaker 4>to think about for your little rats in </v>

735
00:41:58.281 --> 00:42:00.770
<v Speaker 4>school that are developing attention </v>
<v Speaker 4>deficit disorder.</v>

736
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:03.440
<v Speaker 4>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

737
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:07.010
<v Speaker 4>if you take a juvenile rat and he knows </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going to be able to go into a space</v>

738
00:42:07.011 --> 00:42:07.844
<v Speaker 4>where he can play,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'll work to open a door to enter that </v>

739
00:42:09.501 --> 00:42:10.334
<v Speaker 4>space.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's how you know he's motivated </v>

740
00:42:11.241 --> 00:42:14.270
<v Speaker 4>because you can't ask them because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't speak rat and neither can he eat.</v>

741
00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:15.373
<v Speaker 4>So you let go in the play space and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll add another rat go in there of </v>

742
00:42:18.401 --> 00:42:19.234
<v Speaker 4>about the same age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And imagine one rats 10 percent bigger </v>

743
00:42:21.141 --> 00:42:21.974
<v Speaker 4>than the other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what happens first is the rats </v>

744
00:42:23.791 --> 00:42:25.790
<v Speaker 4>wrestle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not aggressive.</v>

745
00:42:25.791 --> 00:42:29.990
<v Speaker 4>They wrestled just like worldwide </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestling federation guys wrestle,</v>

746
00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:31.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

747
00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:32.063
<v Speaker 4>and for many of the same reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the rats will pin each other and if </v>

748
00:42:34.491 --> 00:42:35.324
<v Speaker 4>you pin the other rat you went.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you're 10 percent bigger than the </v>

749
00:42:39.231 --> 00:42:40.720
<v Speaker 4>little rat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can always pin them.</v>

750
00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.200
<v Speaker 4>You can always win.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

751
00:42:42.201 --> 00:42:43.034
<v Speaker 4>So then what happens is the big rap </v>
<v Speaker 4>becomes dominant and the little rat </v>

752
00:42:45.201 --> 00:42:46.034
<v Speaker 4>becomes subordinate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have a wrestling match and then </v>

753
00:42:47.091 --> 00:42:51.170
<v Speaker 4>they part the next time they meet </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's an iterated game,</v>

754
00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:54.980
<v Speaker 4>the next time they meet the little ride </v>
<v Speaker 4>has to ask the big role to play.</v>

755
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:58.430
<v Speaker 4>And he does that the same way that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>ask a child to play,</v>

756
00:42:58.431 --> 00:42:59.264
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you do your play stance just like a dog </v>

757
00:43:01.491 --> 00:43:03.590
<v Speaker 4>does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can understand when a dog does that.</v>

758
00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:06.080
<v Speaker 4>And so the little rat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

759
00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:08.600
<v Speaker 4>gets playful with the big rat and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>they play.</v>

760
00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:09.763
<v Speaker 4>But if you pair them repeatedly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the big grand house to let the little </v>

761
00:43:11.871 --> 00:43:12.704
<v Speaker 4>rat win at least 30 percent of the time </v>
<v Speaker 4>or the little rat won't invite them to </v>

762
00:43:16.041 --> 00:43:18.200
<v Speaker 4>play anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's right.</v>

763
00:43:18.201 --> 00:43:19.550
<v Speaker 4>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so cool.</v>

764
00:43:19.551 --> 00:43:20.450
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jack Yak,</v>

765
00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:23.750
<v Speaker 4>Yak Panksepp discovered that he also </v>
<v Speaker 4>discovered that if you tickled rats,</v>

766
00:43:23.751 --> 00:43:26.060
<v Speaker 4>they giggle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they do it ultrasonically,</v>

767
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:28.910
<v Speaker 4>so you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to like that.</v>

768
00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:31.940
<v Speaker 4>So he discovered the play circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a major,</v>

769
00:43:31.941 --> 00:43:35.320
<v Speaker 4>major neuroscience discovery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so there's an emergent ethic.</v>

770
00:43:35.321 --> 00:43:39.740
<v Speaker 4>Can play a fair play ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now hale,</v>

771
00:43:39.741 --> 00:43:41.210
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember what your question was.</v>

772
00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:46.731
<v Speaker 4>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

773
00:43:46.731 --> 00:43:47.271
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

774
00:43:47.271 --> 00:43:48.104
<v Speaker 4>so what happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that that there is an ethic that </v>

775
00:43:51.141 --> 00:43:51.974
<v Speaker 4>emerges out of social interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then because human beings are </v>

776
00:43:55.041 --> 00:43:58.220
<v Speaker 4>conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we watched that ethic emerge and then we</v>

777
00:43:58.221 --> 00:43:59.054
<v Speaker 4>start telling stories about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We tell stories about the honorable </v>

778
00:44:01.251 --> 00:44:05.120
<v Speaker 4>person and the honorable person who </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't just win today's game,</v>

779
00:44:05.121 --> 00:44:05.954
<v Speaker 4>but when's it in a way that makes </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone invite them to play games </v>

780
00:44:08.031 --> 00:44:09.680
<v Speaker 4>infinitely into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

781
00:44:09.681 --> 00:44:10.514
<v Speaker 4>So that makes you the Metta player.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what you're trying to be your </v>

782
00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:14.133
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the hero who goes into the </v>

783
00:44:14.901 --> 00:44:15.740
<v Speaker 4>unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

784
00:44:15.741 --> 00:44:19.010
<v Speaker 4>It's the person who acts in proper </v>
<v Speaker 4>interactions with other people.</v>

785
00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:20.900
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's truly an emergent.</v>

786
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:23.360
<v Speaker 4>It's an emergent ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's real.</v>

787
00:44:23.361 --> 00:44:24.194
<v Speaker 4>It's more real than anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We map that and that's somehow </v>

788
00:44:26.391 --> 00:44:28.610
<v Speaker 4>associated with our consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

789
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:29.623
<v Speaker 4>we need to understand these sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>things in order to put a biological </v>

790
00:44:32.191 --> 00:44:33.024
<v Speaker 4>structure underneath our religious </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking again and to tie it into our </v>

791
00:44:36.271 --> 00:44:37.104
<v Speaker 4>scientific knowledge and to become awake</v>
<v Speaker 4>and aware of these sorts of things so </v>

792
00:44:40.021 --> 00:44:40.854
<v Speaker 4>that we can reestablish the foundation </v>
<v Speaker 4>underneath our culture and it's a </v>

793
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:47.940
<v Speaker 4>terrifying thing to do because it does </v>
<v Speaker 4>place a burden on people.</v>

794
00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:48.773
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you want to burden you and it's so </v>

795
00:44:50.401 --> 00:44:51.234
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really one of the things that's so </v>

796
00:44:53.251 --> 00:44:55.950
<v Speaker 4>cool about what's been happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand this.</v>

797
00:44:56.410 --> 00:45:00.450
<v Speaker 4>I commented on this at the University of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Toronto debate.</v>

798
00:45:00.451 --> 00:45:04.230
<v Speaker 4>The first thing I did which was </v>
<v Speaker 4>unexpected to me and everyone else.</v>

799
00:45:04.231 --> 00:45:05.400
<v Speaker 4>They didn't know what the Hell I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>

800
00:45:05.401 --> 00:45:06.340
<v Speaker 4>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I looked around,</v>

801
00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:06.781
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

802
00:45:06.781 --> 00:45:07.614
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>80 percent of the people in this room </v>

803
00:45:09.151 --> 00:45:10.470
<v Speaker 4>are men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

804
00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:11.693
<v Speaker 4>why is that something's going on here </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's an indication that men and </v>

805
00:45:13.711 --> 00:45:16.860
<v Speaker 4>women have different interests.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ninety one percent of my viewers of man,</v>

806
00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:19.020
<v Speaker 4>what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is that?</v>

807
00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:19.883
<v Speaker 4>Look at this room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's almost all men and men don't come </v>

808
00:45:23.131 --> 00:45:25.080
<v Speaker 4>to these sorts of things generally </v>
<v Speaker 4>speaking,</v>

809
00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:26.243
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe because they're stubborn and </v>

810
00:45:26.971 --> 00:45:27.990
<v Speaker 4>ornery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

811
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:32.380
<v Speaker 4>but so there's also something </v>
<v Speaker 4>specifically in this for men and,</v>

812
00:45:32.381 --> 00:45:33.390
<v Speaker 4>and by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by,</v>

813
00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:35.400
<v Speaker 4>by implication for women because what do</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want?</v>

814
00:45:35.401 --> 00:45:36.420
<v Speaker 4>Useless man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

815
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:38.760
<v Speaker 4>you don't want useless man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's for sure.</v>

816
00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:42.450
<v Speaker 4>Although if you have a useless man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get to dominate him.</v>

817
00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:44.173
<v Speaker 4>And so maybe that's not such a big price</v>
<v Speaker 4>to pay for having someone around that </v>

818
00:45:46.681 --> 00:45:49.910
<v Speaker 4>you can treat like an infant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's the downside of the,</v>

819
00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:50.773
<v Speaker 4>of the war between men and women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a woman with any sense once a man </v>

820
00:45:53.731 --> 00:45:58.230
<v Speaker 4>who's dangerous but team.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So maybe that's part of.</v>

821
00:45:58.770 --> 00:45:59.550
<v Speaker 4>Well we'll leave it</v>

822
00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:04.550
<v Speaker 2>that</v>
<v Speaker 2>characterize your classroom</v>

823
00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:14.600
<v Speaker 2>occupying this space of the cognitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a general he will say,</v>

824
00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:17.273
<v Speaker 2>I just want to know if you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>substantiate the fact that there is a </v>

825
00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:22.803
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary diverse range of </v>
<v Speaker 2>disciplines which required different </v>

826
00:46:25.741 --> 00:46:27.130
<v Speaker 2>kinds of skills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

827
00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:28.283
<v Speaker 2>in the university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also with the kind of confounding </v>

828
00:46:31.051 --> 00:46:31.884
<v Speaker 2>variable that the university has made </v>
<v Speaker 2>may not be considered by some people to </v>

829
00:46:36.211 --> 00:46:37.044
<v Speaker 2>be the most exclusively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The exclusion was once was as a as a </v>

830
00:46:41.761 --> 00:46:43.570
<v Speaker 2>representation of the enlightened.</v>

831
00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:45.390
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I can talk.</v>

832
00:46:45.391 --> 00:46:47.990
<v Speaker 4>Let me talk about the situation at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ivy League universities.</v>

833
00:46:47.991 --> 00:46:51.560
<v Speaker 4>First,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the question broadly speaking covers the</v>

834
00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:52.513
<v Speaker 4>other question about intelligence and </v>
<v Speaker 4>about its diverse manifestations and </v>

835
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:56.503
<v Speaker 4>about its role in selection for </v>
<v Speaker 4>universities to go back and look at the </v>

836
00:47:00.921 --> 00:47:03.500
<v Speaker 4>records at Harvard for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the early 19 sixties,</v>

837
00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:06.790
<v Speaker 4>the typical icu at for a Harvard student</v>
<v Speaker 4>was about 100,</v>

838
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:09.590
<v Speaker 4>five to 110,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not much above average,</v>

839
00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:12.170
<v Speaker 4>but that's because they were finishing </v>
<v Speaker 4>schools for the,</v>

840
00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:14.210
<v Speaker 4>for the rich,</v>
<v Speaker 4>roughly speaking,</v>

841
00:47:14.211 --> 00:47:17.570
<v Speaker 4>and you know your.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you had a rich father and he made his</v>

842
00:47:17.571 --> 00:47:18.404
<v Speaker 4>money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was probably well above average in </v>

843
00:47:20.771 --> 00:47:23.510
<v Speaker 4>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you are his offspring,</v>

844
00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:24.703
<v Speaker 4>there's regression towards the mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's no reason to assume that by </v>

845
00:47:27.141 --> 00:47:30.760
<v Speaker 4>nature of your position you are going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be particularly intelligent anyways.</v>

846
00:47:30.761 --> 00:47:35.370
<v Speaker 4>The average Ivy League student wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was bright but not outstanding.</v>

847
00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:38.650
<v Speaker 4>So now it's like 100 Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 4>145,</v>

848
00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:41.200
<v Speaker 4>three standard deviations above the mean</v>
<v Speaker 4>because.</v>

849
00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:42.083
<v Speaker 4>And the reason for that is because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're selected by the sat scholastic </v>

850
00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.350
<v Speaker 4>aptitude test.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an Iq test.</v>

851
00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:49.960
<v Speaker 4>They won't say it's an Iq test,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't matter.</v>

852
00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:52.540
<v Speaker 4>It isn't tech,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an Iq test.</v>

853
00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:54.313
<v Speaker 4>It's a simple as that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any any task that contains a </v>

854
00:47:58.571 --> 00:47:59.404
<v Speaker 4>sufficiently diverse range of problem </v>
<v Speaker 4>solving questions that's rank ordered </v>

855
00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:05.770
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

856
00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:10.090
<v Speaker 4>in accuracy among people is an Iq test.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The correlations like point eight,</v>

857
00:48:10.091 --> 00:48:12.880
<v Speaker 4>five.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So and what has happened,</v>

858
00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:16.300
<v Speaker 4>there's two things that have happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the Ivy Leagues have got more and</v>

859
00:48:16.301 --> 00:48:20.050
<v Speaker 4>more selective because they can and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>the average Iq of their students is just</v>

860
00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:24.370
<v Speaker 4>continued to move upwards and then the </v>
<v Speaker 4>average Iq of the population is actually</v>

861
00:48:24.371 --> 00:48:27.010
<v Speaker 4>increased to a substantive degree to </v>
<v Speaker 4>over the last 50 years.</v>

862
00:48:27.011 --> 00:48:27.844
<v Speaker 4>Partly because partly perhaps mostly </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of improved nutrition and and </v>

863
00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:35.280
<v Speaker 4>information exposure along among the.</v>

864
00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:37.660
<v Speaker 4>Like the more deprived members of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture.</v>

865
00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:42.310
<v Speaker 4>It's better to watch tv than to sit </v>
<v Speaker 4>alone in your crib for example,</v>

866
00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:44.770
<v Speaker 4>and isolated and people have enough food</v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

867
00:48:44.771 --> 00:48:45.604
<v Speaker 4>So the really low end of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligence spectrum is being </v>

868
00:48:47.771 --> 00:48:48.604
<v Speaker 4>truncated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the general population Iq is </v>

869
00:48:50.291 --> 00:48:55.210
<v Speaker 4>increased.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So with regards to institutions like the</v>

870
00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:57.100
<v Speaker 4>University of Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say they average Iq at the University of</v>

871
00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:00.940
<v Speaker 4>Toronto was somewhere between 120 130 </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we know that because we've tested it</v>

872
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:02.223
<v Speaker 4>and it's not surprising because you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>basically selected for cognitive </v>

873
00:49:04.301 --> 00:49:05.111
<v Speaker 4>prowess,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

874
00:49:05.111 --> 00:49:07.870
<v Speaker 4>Because grades are rough marker of </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligence.</v>

875
00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:08.793
<v Speaker 4>Conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way also matters independent </v>

876
00:49:10.931 --> 00:49:11.764
<v Speaker 4>trade because the best two predictors of</v>
<v Speaker 4>university grades are conscientiousness </v>

877
00:49:14.741 --> 00:49:17.260
<v Speaker 4>and intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not creativity by the way.</v>

878
00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:21.070
<v Speaker 4>Zero correlation with creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yes.</v>

879
00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:28.400
<v Speaker 7>Comments on this free.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How is committing suicide?</v>

880
00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:32.560
<v Speaker 7>Why is that happening?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Guilt,</v>

881
00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:36.450
<v Speaker 7>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What you want?</v>

882
00:49:40.070 --> 00:49:40.903
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's lots for people to be guilty </v>

883
00:49:41.841 --> 00:49:42.720
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

884
00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:43.563
<v Speaker 4>I mean you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to what degree should you bear the </v>

885
00:49:45.741 --> 00:49:49.480
<v Speaker 4>horrendous guilt of your ancestors?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a.</v>

886
00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:51.320
<v Speaker 4>that's a really hard question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

887
00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:52.793
<v Speaker 4>the radical left answer would be to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>degree that you're privileged by your </v>

888
00:49:55.611 --> 00:49:57.380
<v Speaker 4>ancestry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should bear their guilt.</v>

889
00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:00.980
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Robo,</v>

890
00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:03.620
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The question is then what you do?</v>

891
00:50:03.621 --> 00:50:04.940
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you should do is,</v>

892
00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.073
<v Speaker 4>what I suggested today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say is take responsibility for </v>

893
00:50:08.301 --> 00:50:09.134
<v Speaker 4>your lives and understand that what you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have came at a terrible cost and that </v>

894
00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:17.180
<v Speaker 4>you have an ethical obligation to use it</v>
<v Speaker 4>properly and that would be sufficient to</v>

895
00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:19.850
<v Speaker 4>pay for the sins of your ancestors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so to speak.</v>

896
00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:25.060
<v Speaker 4>I think it's absolutely reprehensible </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the radical left dares to attribute</v>

897
00:50:26.810 --> 00:50:31.190
<v Speaker 4>to to ethnically identified groups,</v>
<v Speaker 4>collective guilt.</v>

898
00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:33.680
<v Speaker 4>There's absolutely no excuse for that.</v>

899
00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:37.520
<v Speaker 4>It's completely murderous and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be rejected out of hand.</v>

900
00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:39.073
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's independent of the issue </v>

901
00:50:40.461 --> 00:50:41.294
<v Speaker 4>about what you should do given that part</v>
<v Speaker 4>of your wealth is a consequence of </v>

902
00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:47.053
<v Speaker 4>historical catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you should try to sort that out </v>

903
00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:52.430
<v Speaker 4>roughly speaking and for everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 4>benefit,</v>

904
00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:56.060
<v Speaker 4>but not necessarily because you're any </v>
<v Speaker 4>more guilty personally.</v>

905
00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:59.120
<v Speaker 4>You're guilty as hell personally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but so is everyone else.</v>

906
00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:02.510
<v Speaker 4>That's the critical thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So is everyone else okay?</v>

907
00:51:02.511 --> 00:51:04.610
<v Speaker 4>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would like to answer that question,</v>

908
00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:07.190
<v Speaker 4>but I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the reason,</v>

909
00:51:07.191 --> 00:51:09.650
<v Speaker 4>there's two reasons for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One is that it's,</v>

910
00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:10.993
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a large element of the answer </v>

911
00:51:12.291 --> 00:51:15.560
<v Speaker 4>that has to be legal and I can't do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

912
00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:16.783
<v Speaker 4>and the other part of it is because I've</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually too tired to formulate a </v>

913
00:51:19.221 --> 00:51:24.170
<v Speaker 4>coherent response to that and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>want it formulated incoherent response.</v>

914
00:51:24.171 --> 00:51:28.370
<v Speaker 4>So I'm sorry that I can't be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean obviously I believe that people's</v>

915
00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:32.600
<v Speaker 4>right to communicate should be as </v>
<v Speaker 4>untrammeled as possible,</v>

916
00:51:32.601 --> 00:51:37.220
<v Speaker 4>but to bridge the gap between that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>your specific concern requires a feat of</v>

917
00:51:37.221 --> 00:51:38.054
<v Speaker 4>mental energy that I can't do at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment and maybe maybe ever that at the </v>

918
00:51:41.991 --> 00:51:42.824
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>

919
00:51:56.550 --> 00:52:01.480
<v Speaker 3>The</v>
<v Speaker 3>social construct of a safe space that</v>

920
00:52:04.810 --> 00:52:08.730
<v Speaker 3>our view on this whole white privilege </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

921
00:52:08.731 --> 00:52:13.731
<v Speaker 3>Is that university,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these other universities?</v>

922
00:52:15.610 --> 00:52:16.443
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the idea of white privilege is </v>

923
00:52:17.501 --> 00:52:21.340
<v Speaker 4>absolutely reprehensible and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>because white people aren't.</v>

924
00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:26.190
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have all sorts of privileges and most</v>

925
00:52:26.191 --> 00:52:27.024
<v Speaker 4>people have privileges of all sorts and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you should be grateful for your </v>

926
00:52:29.041 --> 00:52:31.410
<v Speaker 4>privileges and work to deserve them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say.</v>

927
00:52:31.890 --> 00:52:36.890
<v Speaker 4>But the idea that you can target an </v>
<v Speaker 4>ethnic group with a collective crime,</v>

928
00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:38.123
<v Speaker 4>regardless of the specific innocence or </v>
<v Speaker 4>guilt of the constituent elements of </v>

929
00:52:41.371 --> 00:52:42.204
<v Speaker 4>that group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is absolutely nothing that's more </v>

930
00:52:43.951 --> 00:52:46.750
<v Speaker 4>racist than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's absolutely a boring.</v>

931
00:52:46.770 --> 00:52:47.603
<v Speaker 4>I can't</v>

932
00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:53.390
<v Speaker 5>thank you.</v>

933
00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:55.453
<v Speaker 4>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you really want to know more about </v>

934
00:52:56.481 --> 00:52:59.150
<v Speaker 4>that sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should read about the Kulaks in the,</v>

935
00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:01.460
<v Speaker 4>in the Soviet Union in the 19 twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>k,</v>

936
00:53:01.461 --> 00:53:02.630
<v Speaker 4>u l a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>k,</v>

937
00:53:02.631 --> 00:53:03.464
<v Speaker 4>s because they were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were farmers who were very </v>

938
00:53:05.571 --> 00:53:08.390
<v Speaker 4>productive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were the most productive element of</v>

939
00:53:08.391 --> 00:53:11.120
<v Speaker 4>the agricultural strata in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Russia.</v>

940
00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:12.433
<v Speaker 4>And they were virtually all killed or </v>
<v Speaker 4>raped and robbed by the collectivists </v>

941
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.930
<v Speaker 4>who insisted that because they showed </v>
<v Speaker 4>signs of wealth,</v>

942
00:53:20.931 --> 00:53:22.030
<v Speaker 4>they were criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

943
00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:23.210
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

944
00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:24.173
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

945
00:53:24.330 --> 00:53:26.520
<v Speaker 4>and Roberts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

946
00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:27.953
<v Speaker 4>And one of the consequences of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>prosecution of the Kulaks was the death </v>

947
00:53:30.691 --> 00:53:33.600
<v Speaker 4>of 6 million Ukrainians from a famine in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the 19 thirties.</v>

948
00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:34.613
<v Speaker 4>The idea of collectively held guilt at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the level of the individual as a legal </v>

949
00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:40.013
<v Speaker 4>or philosophical principle is dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's precisely this sort of danger that </v>

950
00:53:45.031 --> 00:53:48.300
<v Speaker 4>people who are really looking for </v>
<v Speaker 4>trouble would push.</v>

951
00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:49.600
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

952
00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:50.433
<v Speaker 4>and just a cursory glance at 20th </v>
<v Speaker 4>century history should teach anyone who </v>

953
00:53:53.491 --> 00:53:58.491
<v Speaker 4>wants to know exactly how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how unacceptable that is with regards to</v>

954
00:53:58.771 --> 00:54:00.270
<v Speaker 4>your first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

955
00:54:00.271 --> 00:54:02.850
<v Speaker 4>there's the safe space issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you also said something right at the</v>

956
00:54:02.851 --> 00:54:03.710
<v Speaker 4>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

957
00:54:03.711 --> 00:54:04.544
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you announced your sexual preference at </v>

958
00:54:06.661 --> 00:54:08.730
<v Speaker 4>the beginning and I understand exactly </v>
<v Speaker 4>why you did that,</v>

959
00:54:08.731 --> 00:54:09.564
<v Speaker 4>but I have a comment about that and this</v>
<v Speaker 4>is something for people in the audience </v>

960
00:54:12.841 --> 00:54:13.674
<v Speaker 4>to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've received at least 25 letters from </v>

961
00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:18.083
<v Speaker 4>transsexual people and that's quite a </v>
<v Speaker 4>few because there aren't that many </v>

962
00:54:19.981 --> 00:54:21.210
<v Speaker 4>transsexual people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

963
00:54:21.211 --> 00:54:22.620
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they're rare.</v>

964
00:54:22.621 --> 00:54:25.590
<v Speaker 4>They're very rare and every single one </v>
<v Speaker 4>of them.</v>

965
00:54:25.591 --> 00:54:26.424
<v Speaker 4>But one was supportive and the one that </v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't supportive was mildly critical </v>

966
00:54:29.821 --> 00:54:32.280
<v Speaker 4>and they said exactly the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you said.</v>

967
00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:33.780
<v Speaker 4>Rough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Roughly speaking is that.</v>

968
00:54:33.930 --> 00:54:36.000
<v Speaker 4>And so what we.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things we want to remember is</v>

969
00:54:36.001 --> 00:54:39.870
<v Speaker 4>that just because some some noisy </v>
<v Speaker 4>activists stand up and say,</v>

970
00:54:39.930 --> 00:54:44.280
<v Speaker 4>because I'm a member of this group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or even worse because I say I'm a member</v>

971
00:54:44.281 --> 00:54:45.114
<v Speaker 4>of this group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am therefore an advocate for that </v>

972
00:54:47.491 --> 00:54:50.580
<v Speaker 4>group's interests is we should just </v>
<v Speaker 4>dispense with that,</v>

973
00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:51.813
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with that self identification as a </v>

974
00:54:54.811 --> 00:54:59.670
<v Speaker 4>worthy representative instantaneously </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's predicated on the idea that</v>

975
00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:04.700
<v Speaker 4>one dimension of a person's identity is </v>
<v Speaker 4>sufficiently what would you say,</v>

976
00:55:06.271 --> 00:55:11.271
<v Speaker 4>broad and all encompassing so that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can infer their political stance,</v>

977
00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:13.680
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you can't.</v>

978
00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:16.410
<v Speaker 4>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Trans people that have written me,</v>

979
00:55:16.411 --> 00:55:18.090
<v Speaker 4>they all say the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A,</v>

980
00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:20.790
<v Speaker 4>those people do not speak for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>B,</v>

981
00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:23.040
<v Speaker 4>we're not all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

982
00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:24.053
<v Speaker 4>most of us think that the enforced </v>
<v Speaker 4>pronoun issue is doing nothing but </v>

983
00:55:27.271 --> 00:55:30.660
<v Speaker 4>drawing negative attention to us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>D,</v>

984
00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:34.710
<v Speaker 4>most of us just want to be referred to </v>
<v Speaker 4>by the other Pronoun.</v>

985
00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:36.330
<v Speaker 4>That's the whole point.</v>

986
00:55:38.130 --> 00:55:43.130
<v Speaker 5>So thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

987
00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:47.960
<v Speaker 4>this has been very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very reassuring to me because one of the</v>

988
00:55:47.961 --> 00:55:48.794
<v Speaker 4>things I presume right from the onset </v>
<v Speaker 4>was that there was no evidence </v>

989
00:55:51.531 --> 00:55:52.364
<v Speaker 4>whatsoever that this nonsensical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>logical legislation and the postmodern </v>

990
00:55:55.341 --> 00:55:56.174
<v Speaker 4>idiocy behind it is in fact demanded by </v>
<v Speaker 4>this community or that it will in any </v>

991
00:56:01.611 --> 00:56:04.370
<v Speaker 4>way be in anyone's best interest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

992
00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:07.240
<v Speaker 4>I don't buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's rotten,</v>

993
00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:10.490
<v Speaker 4>right to the core.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then the safe,</v>

994
00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:13.970
<v Speaker 4>safe space issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you need a safe space,</v>

995
00:56:13.971 --> 00:56:16.580
<v Speaker 4>see a therapist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really,</v>

996
00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:20.870
<v Speaker 4>really university university is not a </v>
<v Speaker 4>safe space.</v>

997
00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:24.340
<v Speaker 4>If University has done right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is a radically space.</v>

998
00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:25.323
<v Speaker 4>If you want to go somewhere and get </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself taken apart intellectually and </v>

999
00:56:29.051 --> 00:56:32.260
<v Speaker 4>then hopefully put back together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you go to university.</v>

1000
00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:35.650
<v Speaker 4>Everything you believe should be </v>
<v Speaker 4>challenged in every possible way,</v>

1001
00:56:35.770 --> 00:56:37.630
<v Speaker 4>but not in a destructive sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1002
00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:41.200
<v Speaker 4>Like when you're renovating a house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't just burn it to the ground and</v>

1003
00:56:41.201 --> 00:56:42.034
<v Speaker 4>walk away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's what the postmodernists due </v>

1004
00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:45.220
<v Speaker 4>to adolescence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

1005
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:50.080
<v Speaker 4>you dismantle it in consultation with </v>
<v Speaker 4>its occupant,</v>

1006
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:54.170
<v Speaker 4>attempting to build something even more </v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful and functional on the.</v>

1007
00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:56.890
<v Speaker 4>On the foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a safe space,</v>

1008
00:56:56.891 --> 00:56:58.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my classes,</v>

1009
00:56:58.151 --> 00:57:00.550
<v Speaker 4>and I tell my students this right at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>beginning,</v>

1010
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:05.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to get them to understand why</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are Nazis,</v>

1011
00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:07.623
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There isn't anything more unsafe than </v>

1012
00:57:09.611 --> 00:57:11.470
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And all of them,</v>

1013
00:57:11.530 --> 00:57:14.870
<v Speaker 4>virtually all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right back to me afterwards and say that</v>

1014
00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:15.903
<v Speaker 4>this was the most worthwhile class I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever had in my life and it changed my </v>

1015
00:57:18.581 --> 00:57:19.151
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1016
00:57:19.151 --> 00:57:19.984
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm teaching you the worst possible </v>

1017
00:57:21.431 --> 00:57:24.250
<v Speaker 4>thing about yourself and your response </v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

1018
00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:25.293
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was so useful and I'm way better </v>

1019
00:57:27.131 --> 00:57:28.330
<v Speaker 4>than I was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1020
00:57:28.331 --> 00:57:29.270
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

1021
00:57:29.350 --> 00:57:30.183
<v Speaker 4>But it's in keeping with the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to be exposed to things that </v>

1022
00:57:32.561 --> 00:57:35.740
<v Speaker 4>you fear and hate because that's where </v>
<v Speaker 4>salvation lies,</v>

1023
00:57:35.770 --> 00:57:38.350
<v Speaker 4>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yes,</v>

1024
00:57:38.590 --> 00:57:40.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned how humanity</v>

1025
00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:46.240
<v Speaker 2>and also how the good we need to attain </v>
<v Speaker 2>is essentially achieved through inactive</v>

1026
00:57:46.310 --> 00:57:47.143
<v Speaker 2>faith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just speaking the truth the best </v>

1027
00:57:47.781 --> 00:57:50.240
<v Speaker 2>we can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I've been thinking about is how</v>

1028
00:57:50.241 --> 00:57:53.950
<v Speaker 2>can we have competence in existence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the good of the logos?</v>

1029
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:56.800
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything to ground our </v>
<v Speaker 2>competencies?</v>

1030
00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:57.933
<v Speaker 4>That's a great question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what is there anything to ground our </v>

1031
00:58:00.251 --> 00:58:02.080
<v Speaker 4>confidence in the logos?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1032
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:03.550
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two things.</v>

1033
00:58:03.610 --> 00:58:04.443
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the testimony of the ages to practical </v>

1034
00:58:08.681 --> 00:58:10.000
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Try It,</v>

1035
00:58:10.810 --> 00:58:12.410
<v Speaker 4>try it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1036
00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:13.263
<v Speaker 4>and what you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you start by while doing what I </v>

1037
00:58:14.591 --> 00:58:15.424
<v Speaker 4>suggested earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is fixing the things around you </v>

1038
00:58:16.751 --> 00:58:20.800
<v Speaker 4>that you can fix because that's like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>embodied manifestation of the logos.</v>

1039
00:58:20.890 --> 00:58:22.840
<v Speaker 4>That's by the way why Christ was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>carpenter,</v>

1040
00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:24.250
<v Speaker 4>are continually speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1041
00:58:24.251 --> 00:58:26.740
<v Speaker 4>Because he fixed things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So and you know,</v>

1042
00:58:26.741 --> 00:58:29.080
<v Speaker 4>if you're a bad carpenter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the things you fix fall apart.</v>

1043
00:58:29.290 --> 00:58:30.123
<v Speaker 4>So there's truth in being a carpenter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then the next thing is you probably </v>

1044
00:58:34.481 --> 00:58:36.610
<v Speaker 4>can't speak the truth because no one </v>
<v Speaker 4>can,</v>

1045
00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:37.893
<v Speaker 4>but you cannot say things you know to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>lies and that's a really good place to </v>

1046
00:58:42.071 --> 00:58:43.290
<v Speaker 4>start.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And all you know,</v>

1047
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:45.670
<v Speaker 4>you can learn to pay attention to that </v>
<v Speaker 4>very rapidly.</v>

1048
00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:47.360
<v Speaker 4>You kind of know already,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you,</v>

1049
00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:50.260
<v Speaker 4>it's a consultation with your embodied </v>
<v Speaker 4>being.</v>

1050
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:52.450
<v Speaker 4>When you say something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know to be false,</v>

1051
00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:57.040
<v Speaker 4>you won't be able to stand up straight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll get week,</v>

1052
00:58:57.041 --> 00:59:00.370
<v Speaker 4>you'll feel a physical d division take </v>
<v Speaker 4>place inside you.</v>

1053
00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:01.353
<v Speaker 4>It's a shame because what you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're failing to bear the burden of </v>

1054
00:59:04.751 --> 00:59:08.470
<v Speaker 4>your existence and you're revealing that</v>
<v Speaker 4>to yourself by your use of deceit.</v>

1055
00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:09.813
<v Speaker 4>Stop saying things you know to be false </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then watch what happens and this is </v>

1056
00:59:13.301 --> 00:59:16.990
<v Speaker 4>the existential element of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can't be proved as far as I can tell,</v>

1057
00:59:17.050 --> 00:59:19.480
<v Speaker 4>the same way that you would prove a </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientific hypothesis.</v>

1058
00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:20.613
<v Speaker 4>It can only be proved in the confines of</v>
<v Speaker 4>your life and you actually have to </v>

1059
00:59:23.571 --> 00:59:24.404
<v Speaker 4>sacrifice your life to the logos in </v>
<v Speaker 4>order to find out because the only way </v>

1060
00:59:29.181 --> 00:59:31.400
<v Speaker 4>you'll test it is by acting it out and </v>
<v Speaker 4>see what happens.</v>

1061
00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:34.160
<v Speaker 4>You don't get to do it twice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1062
00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:39.170
<v Speaker 4>But I think the consequences will reveal</v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves relatively quickly.</v>

1063
00:59:39.171 --> 00:59:43.430
<v Speaker 4>My experience has been that because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>always working with my clients,</v>

1064
00:59:43.450 --> 00:59:46.790
<v Speaker 4>I say clinical clients 20 hours a week </v>
<v Speaker 4>roughly speaking,</v>

1065
00:59:46.791 --> 00:59:51.410
<v Speaker 4>and we're always working on stating </v>
<v Speaker 4>things more clearly,</v>

1066
00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:53.600
<v Speaker 4>trying to make things better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1067
00:59:53.601 --> 00:59:54.434
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it almost inevitably at least makes </v>

1068
00:59:57.290 --> 01:00:00.350
<v Speaker 4>the horrible things bearable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a lot better,</v>

1069
01:00:00.351 --> 01:00:01.200
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1070
01:00:01.201 --> 01:00:06.201
<v Speaker 4>and sometimes makes mediocre things way </v>
<v Speaker 4>better as people's lives expand.</v>

1071
01:00:06.471 --> 01:00:08.540
<v Speaker 4>And they get more confident and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1072
01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:10.880
<v Speaker 4>and straightened things out around them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1073
01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:12.313
<v Speaker 4>so it's the testimony of the ages and </v>
<v Speaker 4>your willingness to test and </v>

1074
01:00:14.571 --> 01:00:16.820
<v Speaker 4>existentially in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the confines of your own life.</v>

1075
01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:21.050
<v Speaker 4>You'll find that there isn't anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>more interesting than you can do because</v>

1076
01:00:21.051 --> 01:00:21.884
<v Speaker 4>what it takes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the predicted it takes the stultifying </v>

1077
01:00:25.101 --> 01:00:25.934
<v Speaker 4>predictability out of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You never know what will happen if you </v>

1078
01:00:28.881 --> 01:00:31.100
<v Speaker 4>say something that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a miracle.</v>

1079
01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:34.340
<v Speaker 4>Miracles will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a very interesting.</v>

1080
01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:37.490
<v Speaker 4>It's crazily interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's good.</v>

1081
01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:38.353
<v Speaker 4>Crazily interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got that to set to say that you </v>

1082
01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:44.570
<v Speaker 4>got that to set against tragedy and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1083
01:00:44.571 --> 01:00:46.310
<v Speaker 4>so you can try it.</v>
