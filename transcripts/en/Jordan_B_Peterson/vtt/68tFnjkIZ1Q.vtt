WEBVTT

1
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.090
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to leap out of the</v>

2
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.660
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic domain now and start</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about at form of approach to</v>

3
00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:31.641
<v Speaker 1>personality and its transformations</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's predicated on a different set of</v>

4
00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:38.691
<v Speaker 1>different philosophical assumptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a bit tricky to navigate this</v>

5
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:43.890
<v Speaker 1>because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it requires the adoption of a different</v>

6
00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:46.290
<v Speaker 1>frame of mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's the case with all</v>

7
00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:48.750
<v Speaker 1>the theorists that we're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussing.</v>

8
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenology probably had its most</v>

9
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.250
<v Speaker 1>thorough explication</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the philosophy of Martin heidegger</v>

10
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.510
<v Speaker 1>and heidegger was actually trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>reconstruct western philosophy from the</v>

11
00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:21.461
<v Speaker 1>bottom up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought that we had been pursuing an</v>

12
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.810
<v Speaker 1>improper pathway conceptually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really ever since the time of the</v>

13
00:01:26.811 --> 00:01:27.680
<v Speaker 1>ancient Greeks.</v>

14
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.553
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

15
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.920
<v Speaker 1>back around the turn of the century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the previous century,</v>

16
00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:39.290
<v Speaker 1>that from the 19th to the 20th century,</v>

17
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.270
<v Speaker 1>a new form of geometry was invented and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that geometry was predicated on</v>

18
00:01:46.271 --> 00:01:49.210
<v Speaker 1>different axioms than Euclidean</v>
<v Speaker 1>geometry.</v>

19
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people had thought for thousands of</v>

20
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.270
<v Speaker 1>years that the world was properly</v>
<v Speaker 1>described by Euclidean geometry.</v>

21
00:01:55.271 --> 00:02:00.010
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you employ a system like Euclidean</v>

22
00:02:00.011 --> 00:02:00.880
<v Speaker 1>geometry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>

23
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.300
<v Speaker 1>there's axioms that you have to accept</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're like the rules of the game.</v>

24
00:02:04.301 --> 00:02:07.330
<v Speaker 1>And once you accept the axioms then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can go ahead and play the game.</v>

25
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.350
<v Speaker 1>But there are other forms of geometry</v>
<v Speaker 1>invented and in the,</v>

26
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.700
<v Speaker 1>in the later part of the 19th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it turned out that those forms with</v>

27
00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:23.670
<v Speaker 1>different axioms actually described the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world better than the Euclidean forums.</v>

28
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.580
<v Speaker 1>So sorta like the transformation from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Newton to Einstein.</v>

29
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.570
<v Speaker 1>This was the transformation from Euclid</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>

30
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.820
<v Speaker 1>I think I've got his name right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reman,</v>

31
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:34.481
<v Speaker 1>r,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

32
00:02:34.481 --> 00:02:34.961
<v Speaker 1>e,</v>
<v Speaker 1>m,</v>

33
00:02:34.961 --> 00:02:37.420
<v Speaker 1>a,N ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>n who developed a new form of geometry.</v>

34
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.570
<v Speaker 1>And it turned out to be just the</v>
<v Speaker 1>geometry that Einstein needed when he</v>

35
00:02:40.571 --> 00:02:44.080
<v Speaker 1>was putting his theories forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I'm telling you that is</v>

36
00:02:44.081 --> 00:02:48.040
<v Speaker 1>because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think of systems that have</v>

37
00:02:48.041 --> 00:02:50.410
<v Speaker 1>different axioms as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as different tools,</v>

38
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.330
<v Speaker 1>same idea that piaget was trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>express when he talked about how</v>

39
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.470
<v Speaker 1>children's cognitive representations</v>
<v Speaker 1>underwent</v>

40
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 1>staged transformations so that they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to apply new principles.</v>

41
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Not only a new way of looking at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

42
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:11.380
<v Speaker 1>but they were fundamentally retooling</v>
<v Speaker 1>their presumptions about how the world</v>

43
00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:14.950
<v Speaker 1>operated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And heidegger tried to do the same thing</v>

44
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:17.170
<v Speaker 1>with philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

45
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 1>and it's tricky to figure out exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he was talking about,</v>

46
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:21.931
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll,</v>

47
00:03:21.931 --> 00:03:25.240
<v Speaker 1>I'll give it a shot and then we can move</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward with Rogers.</v>

48
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 1>So since the dawn of the scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and likely before that,</v>

49
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 1>we have tended to believe that we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>subjects in a world of objects.</v>

50
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.270
<v Speaker 1>And that's obviously a very useful way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to view the world.</v>

51
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.560
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>formalizing that in the form of science</v>

52
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.860
<v Speaker 1>has enabled us to extend control over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world in ways that we were not able</v>

53
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:53.360
<v Speaker 1>to before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

54
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.030
<v Speaker 1>to formulate the idea of an objective</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth has been extraordinary useful</v>

55
00:03:58.031 --> 00:04:00.880
<v Speaker 1>maneuver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea roughly is that</v>

56
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.680
<v Speaker 1>everyone's perceptions can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>contaminated by their own biases and</v>

57
00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 1>their own fantasies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That subjective biases and fantasies and</v>

58
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.610
<v Speaker 1>you can overcome that by stringently</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifying the conditions under which an</v>

59
00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:18.370
<v Speaker 1>observation takes place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be an experimental method.</v>

60
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Having multiple people view the</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences separately.</v>

61
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.080
<v Speaker 1>Have them detail out what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences are and then look for</v>

62
00:04:26.081 --> 00:04:27.760
<v Speaker 1>commonalities across them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

63
00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:30.010
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the common leds across the set of</v>

64
00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:33.670
<v Speaker 1>observations constituted description of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the objective world.</v>

65
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.530
<v Speaker 1>And that's been insanely powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

66
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.950
<v Speaker 1>crazily powerful.</v>

67
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not all there is to the</v>

68
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.840
<v Speaker 1>scientific method,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a big part of it.</v>

69
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is an emergent problem with that.</v>

70
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.920
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps it's complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the emergent problems with</v>

71
00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:58.921
<v Speaker 1>that is maybe a consequence of stripping</v>
<v Speaker 1>the subjectivity out of the world.</v>

72
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.580
<v Speaker 1>So what science does is consider</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything subjective as a form of bias or</v>

73
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:10.960
<v Speaker 1>error in the observation and then get</v>
<v Speaker 1>rid of it.</v>

74
00:05:10.961 --> 00:05:15.730
<v Speaker 1>And so what you're left with when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>formulate the scientific world is a</v>

75
00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:19.660
<v Speaker 1>world that stripped of subjectivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem with that is that you're</v>

76
00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:22.000
<v Speaker 1>a subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when you strip the world of its</v>

77
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:25.420
<v Speaker 1>subjectivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of leaves you isolated,</v>

78
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.480
<v Speaker 1>like an isolated being with no necessary</v>
<v Speaker 1>connection to objective reality in the</v>

79
00:05:32.051 --> 00:05:37.051
<v Speaker 1>midst of a set of impersonal fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to have psychological</v>

80
00:05:37.631 --> 00:05:41.140
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the psychological consequences are</v>

81
00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:42.220
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

82
00:05:42.221 --> 00:05:45.400
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's easier to develop a</v>

83
00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:47.020
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic sense of being.</v>

84
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.560
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you believe that the world is nothing</v>

85
00:05:50.561 --> 00:05:55.561
<v Speaker 1>but objects and that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally an object among many and</v>

86
00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.550
<v Speaker 1>not a particularly important one at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

87
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.020
<v Speaker 1>So there are psychological consequences</v>
<v Speaker 1>to adopting the scientific worldview.</v>

88
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.790
<v Speaker 1>Prior to the emergence of the scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>worldview,</v>

89
00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:14.300
<v Speaker 1>people were more embedded in what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>might think about as a mythological</v>

90
00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:15.380
<v Speaker 1>landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

91
00:06:15.381 --> 00:06:20.030
<v Speaker 1>where every element of being had it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>place in something that approximated a</v>

92
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 1>master plan or at least a meaningful</v>
<v Speaker 1>plan.</v>

93
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.790
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea of the meaning fullness</v>
<v Speaker 1>of life was not necessarily such a</v>

94
00:06:28.731 --> 00:06:30.770
<v Speaker 1>pressing intellectual concern.</v>

95
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:35.923
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

96
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.840
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we don't know the full extent of</v>

97
00:06:38.841 --> 00:06:41.660
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've talked to you a little bit</v>

98
00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:44.750
<v Speaker 1>about niches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Idea is expressed at the end of the 19th</v>

99
00:06:44.751 --> 00:06:49.130
<v Speaker 1>century about the death of God and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>prognostication that the collapse of</v>

100
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:55.450
<v Speaker 1>classic systems of meaning would open up</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to possession by nihilism and</v>

101
00:06:56.721 --> 00:07:00.200
<v Speaker 1>also by potentially totalitarian</v>
<v Speaker 1>political systems.</v>

102
00:07:00.201 --> 00:07:02.300
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to have been what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened now.</v>

103
00:07:02.301 --> 00:07:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Heidegger was very concerned about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>among other things,</v>

104
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:12.100
<v Speaker 1>and so he decided to reconsider reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the bottom up and so what he did</v>

105
00:07:15.081 --> 00:07:17.090
<v Speaker 1>was generate an alternative set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>axioms.</v>

106
00:07:17.091 --> 00:07:18.410
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said something like,</v>

107
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:23.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if we decide to make reality?</v>

108
00:07:23.541 --> 00:07:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Everything that we experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget about the subject object divide.</v>

109
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.720
<v Speaker 1>One of the other problems with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>subject object divide for example,</v>

110
00:07:32.721 --> 00:07:34.370
<v Speaker 1>is accounting for consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

111
00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a problem that science</v>
<v Speaker 1>really hasn't got any distance with at</v>

112
00:07:37.851 --> 00:07:38.150
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

113
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:39.770
<v Speaker 1>As far as I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

114
00:07:39.771 --> 00:07:42.830
<v Speaker 1>people have been trying to crack the</v>
<v Speaker 1>secret of consciousness obviously for a</v>

115
00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:45.740
<v Speaker 1>very long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they've been trying to do it</v>

116
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.510
<v Speaker 1>formally and using scientific methods at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least for the last 50 years,</v>

117
00:07:50.511 --> 00:07:53.630
<v Speaker 1>and my sense of that is that they've got</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely nowhere.</v>

118
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's a bit unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're better at representing how</v>

119
00:07:58.341 --> 00:08:02.150
<v Speaker 1>conscious experiences manifest</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in the brain.</v>

120
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:06.320
<v Speaker 1>But we're certainly no better at</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding how it is that we</v>

121
00:08:06.321 --> 00:08:08.780
<v Speaker 1>experience things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the problem of Kalia,</v>

122
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.900
<v Speaker 1>that that's how the philosophers</v>
<v Speaker 1>describe it.</v>

123
00:08:11.901 --> 00:08:14.510
<v Speaker 1>And quality is the quality of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

124
00:08:14.511 --> 00:08:16.820
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact of pain for example,</v>

125
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:21.560
<v Speaker 1>in the pain you feel is by no means</v>
<v Speaker 1>identical at least as far as you're</v>

126
00:08:21.561 --> 00:08:24.770
<v Speaker 1>concerned to some pattern of</v>
<v Speaker 1>neurological activity.</v>

127
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.030
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pain.</v>

128
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.030
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be a fundamental reality of</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

129
00:08:29.031 --> 00:08:31.280
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think pain is the fundamental reality.</v>

130
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:36.280
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the only thing that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>will never deny but and so,</v>

131
00:08:38.031 --> 00:08:40.940
<v Speaker 1>so there are these aspects of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence that are subjective,</v>

132
00:08:40.941 --> 00:08:44.090
<v Speaker 1>like your experience of color and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of beauty and just your</v>

133
00:08:44.091 --> 00:08:49.091
<v Speaker 1>experience of things or maybe just your</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience and your experience plays a</v>

134
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.960
<v Speaker 1>in role in the structure of being</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

135
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.730
<v Speaker 1>Cause you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what would there be if there was</v>

136
00:08:56.731 --> 00:08:59.610
<v Speaker 1>nothing conscious and you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well</v>

137
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.680
<v Speaker 1>what would there be if there was nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious of being?</v>

138
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a tricky question because it</v>

139
00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:11.841
<v Speaker 1>depends on your a priori axioms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not obvious what there would</v>

140
00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:14.220
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the absence of a conscious observer.</v>

141
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.420
<v Speaker 1>There wouldn't obviously be any duration</v>
<v Speaker 1>between things.</v>

142
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.870
<v Speaker 1>It would be very difficult to specify</v>
<v Speaker 1>things in terms of size.</v>

143
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:26.850
<v Speaker 1>There wouldn't be any of the qualities</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we experience that we experience</v>

144
00:09:26.851 --> 00:09:30.660
<v Speaker 1>are being as having cause color doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to be an intrinsic part of the</v>

145
00:09:30.661 --> 00:09:31.200
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

146
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Smell doesn't seem to be intrinsic part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world.</v>

147
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.020
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more you think about it,</v>

148
00:09:37.021 --> 00:09:40.980
<v Speaker 1>you'd find the more difficult it is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>determine exactly what their would be if</v>

149
00:09:40.981 --> 00:09:45.210
<v Speaker 1>there was no one to observe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not the tree in the forest</v>

150
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:46.230
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Precisely.</v>

151
00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:50.190
<v Speaker 1>It's not so much if a tree falls in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>forest and there's no one to hear it,</v>

152
00:09:50.191 --> 00:09:52.770
<v Speaker 1>does it make a sound?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's more a matter of the</v>

153
00:09:52.771 --> 00:09:56.820
<v Speaker 1>definition of sound than anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is more like if there's a tree in</v>

154
00:09:56.821 --> 00:09:59.820
<v Speaker 1>the forest and there isn't anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a tree?</v>

155
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's a whole different question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

156
00:10:02.831 --> 00:10:07.831
<v Speaker 1>so what heidegger did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because he was not pleased,</v>

157
00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:13.041
<v Speaker 1>I suppose with the metaphysical</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of the scientific worldview</v>

158
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:18.600
<v Speaker 1>and also perhaps because he wasn't very</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy about our ability to account for</v>

159
00:10:18.601 --> 00:10:22.350
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He decided to see what would happen if</v>

160
00:10:22.351 --> 00:10:24.030
<v Speaker 1>he played a different kind of game.</v>

161
00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.880
<v Speaker 1>And you can do that in an intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion.</v>

162
00:10:26.881 --> 00:10:27.661
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

163
00:10:27.661 --> 00:10:30.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the set of axioms out of which</v>

164
00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:33.720
<v Speaker 1>assistant will emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like here's a set of rules out of which</v>

165
00:10:33.721 --> 00:10:36.180
<v Speaker 1>a game would emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same idea.</v>

166
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:38.850
<v Speaker 1>What if we start with a different set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>rules?</v>

167
00:10:38.851 --> 00:10:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what we can do if we do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You kind of do that when you play one</v>

168
00:10:42.781 --> 00:10:45.740
<v Speaker 1>video game rather than another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know their little worlds that pop</v>

169
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.130
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's different,</v>

170
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:50.140
<v Speaker 1>there's a different underlying structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can go inside that world</v>

171
00:10:50.141 --> 00:10:53.340
<v Speaker 1>and experiment with it and see what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what comes out of it.</v>

172
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.120
<v Speaker 1>So heidegger decided to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

173
00:10:57.121 --> 00:10:59.910
<v Speaker 1>what we're going to do instead is we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to assume that everything we</v>

174
00:10:59.911 --> 00:11:02.760
<v Speaker 1>experience is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to make our field of</v>

175
00:11:02.761 --> 00:11:07.761
<v Speaker 1>experience itself reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that would mean from heidegger's</v>

176
00:11:08.881 --> 00:11:13.881
<v Speaker 1>point of view that everything about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the being that manifests itself to you</v>

177
00:11:16.951 --> 00:11:18.600
<v Speaker 1>is to be regarded as equally real.</v>

178
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.210
<v Speaker 1>So then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that makes pain a fundamental</v>

179
00:11:21.211 --> 00:11:23.730
<v Speaker 1>reality that makes it anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fundamental reality.</v>

180
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:27.180
<v Speaker 1>It makes beauty and color fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 1>realities.</v>

181
00:11:27.181 --> 00:11:32.181
<v Speaker 1>They're not self-evidently reduceable to</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything else which they would be,</v>

182
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.440
<v Speaker 1>which they are in this scientific from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scientific perspective because you</v>

183
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.830
<v Speaker 1>have to think about them as</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestations of some more fundamental</v>

184
00:11:40.831 --> 00:11:44.490
<v Speaker 1>underlying material reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess that's another problem with</v>

185
00:11:44.491 --> 00:11:48.810
<v Speaker 1>the subject object model and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>material model.</v>

186
00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:54.770
<v Speaker 1>When you aggregate Adam's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you arrange them in certain forms</v>

187
00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.510
<v Speaker 1>and when they manifest themselves as</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain molecules and then in more</v>

188
00:11:58.511 --> 00:12:01.840
<v Speaker 1>complex structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they seem to take on all sorts of</v>

189
00:12:01.841 --> 00:12:06.580
<v Speaker 1>qualities that you couldn't predict if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just knew about the sub atomic</v>

190
00:12:06.581 --> 00:12:10.930
<v Speaker 1>particles in the atoms themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so of course they're what are called</v>

191
00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:12.310
<v Speaker 1>emergent properties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you say,</v>

192
00:12:12.311 --> 00:12:16.580
<v Speaker 1>well you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>observe hydrogen and you can observe</v>

193
00:12:16.581 --> 00:12:20.840
<v Speaker 1>oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't make itself evident for</v>

194
00:12:20.841 --> 00:12:22.820
<v Speaker 1>you to be able to predict the properties</v>
<v Speaker 1>of water.</v>

195
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.340
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's a much simpler</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

196
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.400
<v Speaker 1>All things considered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the problem of figuring you out</v>

197
00:12:28.401 --> 00:12:31.760
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this crazily complex aggregate of these</v>

198
00:12:31.761 --> 00:12:34.700
<v Speaker 1>hypothetical hypothetically simple</v>
<v Speaker 1>entities,</v>

199
00:12:34.701 --> 00:12:39.701
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't obvious how their elemental</v>
<v Speaker 1>properties can combine to produce you.</v>

200
00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:45.500
<v Speaker 1>It's not obvious at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly not obvious how a</v>

201
00:12:45.501 --> 00:12:50.501
<v Speaker 1>material that's supposed to be dead</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter so to speak can can manifest</v>

202
00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:55.220
<v Speaker 1>consciousness no matter how complex Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's arranged.</v>

203
00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.013
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

204
00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:03.910
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heidegger leading them were attempted to</v>

205
00:13:06.011 --> 00:13:11.011
<v Speaker 1>produce a philosophical model of being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'll talk more specifically about</v>

206
00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:14.890
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenologists after we're done</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Rogers,</v>

207
00:13:14.891 --> 00:13:19.891
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he fits in that philosophical framework.</v>

208
00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:22.453
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

209
00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.940
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I've thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a bit of a tangent,</v>

210
00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:42.790
<v Speaker 1>but I'll move back to the moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards.</v>

211
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:46.930
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked the psycho analyst and I</v>

212
00:13:46.931 --> 00:13:50.440
<v Speaker 1>liked the idea that you have a psyche</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's inside of you and that that is</v>

213
00:13:50.441 --> 00:13:54.040
<v Speaker 1>structured in partly consciously and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>part conch unconsciously.</v>

214
00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.550
<v Speaker 1>There's something about that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really cool and I've learned a lot from</v>

215
00:13:57.551 --> 00:14:00.250
<v Speaker 1>the psychoanalyst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know there is a funny</v>

216
00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.220
<v Speaker 1>consequence of thinking the way they</v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

217
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.220
<v Speaker 1>And you do think the way they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you don't know it,</v>

218
00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:09.700
<v Speaker 1>like we tend to think that a lot of us</v>
<v Speaker 1>has inside our head.</v>

219
00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the psyche model basically,</v>

220
00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:16.030
<v Speaker 1>but the more I've practiced as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical psychologist,</v>

221
00:14:16.031 --> 00:14:18.010
<v Speaker 1>the last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've actually been convinced that that's</v>

222
00:14:18.011 --> 00:14:20.020
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I could say,</v>

223
00:14:20.021 --> 00:14:22.120
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say I want to know about your</v>

224
00:14:22.121 --> 00:14:23.740
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think,</v>

225
00:14:23.741 --> 00:14:24.760
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to know you.</v>

226
00:14:24.761 --> 00:14:28.480
<v Speaker 1>I want to know about your subjectivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to know what's inside of</v>

227
00:14:28.481 --> 00:14:30.520
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't actually what you do want</v>

228
00:14:30.521 --> 00:14:32.350
<v Speaker 1>to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're doing clinical work,</v>

229
00:14:32.351 --> 00:14:34.480
<v Speaker 1>say with someone you want to know,</v>

230
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.840
<v Speaker 1>did they have any friends?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really important because if</v>

231
00:14:39.841 --> 00:14:44.580
<v Speaker 1>you're miserable and anxious and badly</v>
<v Speaker 1>placed in life and misbehaving,</v>

232
00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:48.390
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons that all of that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>occur is because you don't have any</v>

233
00:14:48.391 --> 00:14:49.500
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know anyone,</v>

234
00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:54.950
<v Speaker 1>and that's not something that's you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's it's you localized in a broader</v>

235
00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:57.650
<v Speaker 1>sphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

236
00:14:57.651 --> 00:15:00.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have a job and well,</v>

237
00:15:00.171 --> 00:15:02.480
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you actually make enough money with</v>

238
00:15:02.481 --> 00:15:05.420
<v Speaker 1>your job?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it satisfying for you in any way?</v>

239
00:15:05.421 --> 00:15:07.490
<v Speaker 1>Are you bullied all the time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're at work?</v>

240
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Does it provoke anxiety?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a career that allows you to go</v>

241
00:15:11.211 --> 00:15:13.070
<v Speaker 1>somewhere?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you overworked?</v>

242
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's start with just the first</v>

243
00:15:15.201 --> 00:15:17.120
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a job?</v>

244
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the answer to that is it,</v>

245
00:15:18.411 --> 00:15:21.770
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a serious problem and that</v>

246
00:15:21.771 --> 00:15:25.530
<v Speaker 1>would enough might be to depress you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>make you anxious and hopeless and</v>

247
00:15:25.531 --> 00:15:26.990
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic and all of those things.</v>

248
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:28.280
<v Speaker 1>And you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

249
00:15:28.281 --> 00:15:30.980
<v Speaker 1>you're not reacting very well to not</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a job.</v>

250
00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.850
<v Speaker 1>But that's kind of a foolish objection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though some of it might be true.</v>

251
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.610
<v Speaker 1>One problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you're not reacting very well to</v>

252
00:15:37.611 --> 00:15:40.160
<v Speaker 1>not having a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But another problem is that you don't</v>

253
00:15:40.161 --> 00:15:42.920
<v Speaker 1>have a job and that actually constitutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>a problem,</v>

254
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to eat.</v>

255
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.380
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a place to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those aren't psychological problems.</v>

256
00:15:48.381 --> 00:15:50.630
<v Speaker 1>Precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though a psychological problem</v>

257
00:15:50.631 --> 00:15:52.880
<v Speaker 1>could make it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

258
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.030
<v Speaker 1>are you as educated as you should be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another question.</v>

259
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:59.690
<v Speaker 1>How do you handle drugs and alcohol?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they taking you down a bad pathway,</v>

260
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:01.460
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

261
00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:05.000
<v Speaker 1>what about intimate relationships?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have one?</v>

262
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:08.090
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a plan for one or they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a never ending series of</v>

263
00:16:08.091 --> 00:16:10.580
<v Speaker 1>catastrophes or something that you avoid</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>

264
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:13.520
<v Speaker 1>That's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe people don't,</v>

265
00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.800
<v Speaker 1>aren't attracted to you for one reason</v>
<v Speaker 1>or another.</v>

266
00:16:15.801 --> 00:16:18.170
<v Speaker 1>And you could think about that as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological problem,</v>

267
00:16:18.171 --> 00:16:22.520
<v Speaker 1>but it's an interpersonal problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the degree to which that's a</v>

268
00:16:22.521 --> 00:16:27.110
<v Speaker 1>psychological problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is certainly an specified when you first</v>

269
00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:29.330
<v Speaker 1>begin to talk to somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about your family?</v>

270
00:16:29.331 --> 00:16:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a family?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's hard to be in the world all</v>

271
00:16:32.301 --> 00:16:33.980
<v Speaker 1>by yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>

272
00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:37.940
<v Speaker 1>It makes things a lot more stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though having a family can also be</v>

273
00:16:37.941 --> 00:16:40.040
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

274
00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:43.190
<v Speaker 1>do you have plans to have children?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you doing with your parents?</v>

275
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.590
<v Speaker 1>Do you get along with your siblings?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

276
00:16:45.591 --> 00:16:48.830
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of that to me is more fundamental.</v>

277
00:16:48.831 --> 00:16:52.370
<v Speaker 1>And it's outside of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are elements of your experience</v>

278
00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:57.640
<v Speaker 1>more broadly conceptualized more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are objects of your psychology or</v>

279
00:16:57.891 --> 00:17:00.200
<v Speaker 1>of your internal experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

280
00:17:00.201 --> 00:17:01.034
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like</v>

281
00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.010
<v Speaker 1>while a person is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

282
00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.790
<v Speaker 1>is it is a creature that exists at</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple levels of analysis,</v>

283
00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something might go wrong with you at a</v>

284
00:17:12.821 --> 00:17:15.250
<v Speaker 1>cellular level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe you're born with a genetic</v>

285
00:17:15.251 --> 00:17:19.720
<v Speaker 1>abnormality so something's wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you molecularly or you have something</v>

286
00:17:19.721 --> 00:17:22.810
<v Speaker 1>wrong with a major Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe there's something wrong with</v>

287
00:17:22.811 --> 00:17:26.830
<v Speaker 1>you psychologically or maybe you're in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological family or maybe you're</v>

288
00:17:26.831 --> 00:17:29.980
<v Speaker 1>stuck in a pathological social system</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

289
00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:34.930
<v Speaker 1>and figuring out what's why you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering means going up and down those</v>

290
00:17:34.931 --> 00:17:37.810
<v Speaker 1>different levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to specify the appropriate level</v>

291
00:17:37.811 --> 00:17:40.600
<v Speaker 1>for analysis and also the appropriate</v>
<v Speaker 1>level for intervention.</v>

292
00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.820
<v Speaker 1>And for me as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I've said,</v>

293
00:17:42.821 --> 00:17:46.090
<v Speaker 1>even though I'm a great admirer of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysts and I do things like</v>

294
00:17:46.091 --> 00:17:49.380
<v Speaker 1>dream analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I really find you an incredibly</v>

295
00:17:49.381 --> 00:17:53.220
<v Speaker 1>useful and enlightening the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental level of analysis is,</v>

296
00:17:53.221 --> 00:17:55.080
<v Speaker 1>well what's your experience structured</v>
<v Speaker 1>like?</v>

297
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:58.080
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that isn't localized in you.</v>

298
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:02.160
<v Speaker 1>Now the behaviorists do that too because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the things I really liked</v>

299
00:18:02.161 --> 00:18:04.020
<v Speaker 1>about the behavioral approach to</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy.</v>

300
00:18:04.021 --> 00:18:05.730
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very concrete and practical.</v>

301
00:18:05.731 --> 00:18:07.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

302
00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.130
<v Speaker 1>there are certain things that you need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have in order to live properly and</v>

303
00:18:11.131 --> 00:18:14.790
<v Speaker 1>maybe you don't have the skills or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherewithal where with all to accumulate</v>

304
00:18:14.791 --> 00:18:17.880
<v Speaker 1>them and we'll break them down into tiny</v>
<v Speaker 1>little pieces and you'll practice.</v>

305
00:18:17.881 --> 00:18:20.250
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with someone who doesn't have any</v>

306
00:18:20.251 --> 00:18:22.950
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you do a micro analysis of their</v>

307
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:27.540
<v Speaker 1>social skills say and maybe an analysis</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the kinds of anxiety that are</v>

308
00:18:27.541 --> 00:18:29.880
<v Speaker 1>stopping them from going out and meeting</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

309
00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:32.790
<v Speaker 1>And then you address those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>practically one by one.</v>

310
00:18:32.791 --> 00:18:34.590
<v Speaker 1>You try to get the person to have some</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>

311
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.980
<v Speaker 1>He tried to figure out how they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>establish an intimate relationship.</v>

312
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.440
<v Speaker 1>You see if you can help them sort out</v>
<v Speaker 1>their family,</v>

313
00:18:40.441 --> 00:18:42.330
<v Speaker 1>you do what you can about their</v>
<v Speaker 1>employment.</v>

314
00:18:42.331 --> 00:18:46.650
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that's only tangentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>related to really in some sense to the</v>

315
00:18:46.651 --> 00:18:50.070
<v Speaker 1>structure of their psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things you'll see if you</v>

316
00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:54.450
<v Speaker 1>work as a clinician or as a counselor is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that most of the time people come and</v>

317
00:18:54.451 --> 00:18:57.060
<v Speaker 1>see you because they have problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because they have psychological</v>

318
00:18:57.061 --> 00:19:00.810
<v Speaker 1>problems and those things are not that</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy to distinguish.</v>

319
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:03.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of the psychoanalytic idea</v>

320
00:19:03.151 --> 00:19:04.830
<v Speaker 1>sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if you just start your act</v>

321
00:19:04.831 --> 00:19:06.630
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything would work out for you.</v>

322
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

323
00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:14.100
<v Speaker 1>there's some truth in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

324
00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:19.720
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're 55 years old and you've just</v>

325
00:19:19.721 --> 00:19:24.260
<v Speaker 1>been laid off work</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe through no fault of your own,</v>

326
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:29.300
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious how much getting your</v>
<v Speaker 1>act together is going to help you find</v>

327
00:19:29.301 --> 00:19:32.630
<v Speaker 1>another job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the actual problem that you're</v>

328
00:19:32.631 --> 00:19:36.200
<v Speaker 1>facing me have relatively little to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>

329
00:19:36.201 --> 00:19:40.430
<v Speaker 1>And that would especially be the case if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're maybe on the bottom half of the</v>

330
00:19:40.431 --> 00:19:44.810
<v Speaker 1>intelligence distribution for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it isn't as easy for you just to</v>

331
00:19:44.811 --> 00:19:48.140
<v Speaker 1>go out and pick up new skills at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>drop of a hat,</v>

332
00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.630
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that gets harder as you get older</v>

333
00:19:50.631 --> 00:19:53.810
<v Speaker 1>because your Iq actually declines quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>substantially as you get older.</v>

334
00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.680
<v Speaker 1>That that working or the the fluid</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence part anyways,</v>

335
00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:00.260
<v Speaker 1>exercise can keep that at bay by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

336
00:20:00.261 --> 00:20:03.530
<v Speaker 1>It's the best way to keep that at bay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

337
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:09.530
<v Speaker 1>you can think from the phenomenological</v>
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint of your experience as a whole</v>

338
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:12.740
<v Speaker 1>instead of you being a subject in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>objective world.</v>

339
00:20:12.741 --> 00:20:16.280
<v Speaker 1>And so here's another way of of here's</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's quite useful.</v>

340
00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.370
<v Speaker 1>Young talked about this because he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving towards a phenomenological</v>

341
00:20:19.371 --> 00:20:22.310
<v Speaker 1>perspective later in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last book he wrote was called</v>

342
00:20:22.311 --> 00:20:27.311
<v Speaker 1>mysterium [inaudible] and he talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about three conjunctions that needed to</v>

343
00:20:27.441 --> 00:20:31.520
<v Speaker 1>take place in order for someone to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>well constituted psychologically.</v>

344
00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:36.910
<v Speaker 1>And you know how piaget talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning that you could not only follow</v>

345
00:20:37.251 --> 00:20:40.670
<v Speaker 1>rules but that you could make rules for</v>
<v Speaker 1>new games as sort of the highest level</v>

346
00:20:40.671 --> 00:20:45.650
<v Speaker 1>of moral development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say young extended the Piagetian</v>

347
00:20:45.651 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 1>moral continuum up past</v>

348
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.410
<v Speaker 3>what piaget had envisioned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now he didn't,</v>

349
00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.710
<v Speaker 3>he didn't do that cause he wasn't trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to extend Piaget's model.</v>

350
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.890
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can think about it the same way.</v>

351
00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:01.510
<v Speaker 3>It's not easy to come up with a moral</v>
<v Speaker 3>motive being say,</v>

352
00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:04.270
<v Speaker 3>that transcends the ability to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>rules for new games.</v>

353
00:21:04.271 --> 00:21:05.530
<v Speaker 3>That's damn smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

354
00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:06.040
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

355
00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:09.190
<v Speaker 3>that's a major home run by piaget as far</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I'm concerned.</v>

356
00:21:09.191 --> 00:21:11.530
<v Speaker 3>But Young said something like this said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

357
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:14.770
<v Speaker 3>when you're going through the process of</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological integration,</v>

358
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.990
<v Speaker 3>here's a way of conceptualizing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he thought about this as</v>

359
00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:26.310
<v Speaker 3>symbolically as male female pairings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because as I've tried to point out the</v>

360
00:21:26.921 --> 00:21:28.780
<v Speaker 3>most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the most fundamental character</v>

361
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:33.010
<v Speaker 3>categories that are mythological</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagination uses to structure the world</v>

362
00:21:33.011 --> 00:21:34.870
<v Speaker 3>is the category of masculine and</v>
<v Speaker 3>feminine.</v>

363
00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:36.670
<v Speaker 3>And it moves that around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

364
00:21:36.671 --> 00:21:38.080
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a fundamental metaphor.</v>

365
00:21:38.081 --> 00:21:39.580
<v Speaker 3>So you can move that around anywhere.</v>

366
00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:42.130
<v Speaker 3>And so young thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well one of the things that you're</v>

367
00:21:42.131 --> 00:21:46.480
<v Speaker 3>trying to do is to get your thoughts and</v>
<v Speaker 3>your emotions integrated.</v>

368
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:48.101
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

369
00:21:48.101 --> 00:21:51.100
<v Speaker 3>the Classic Enlightenment Viewpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking,</v>

370
00:21:51.101 --> 00:21:54.310
<v Speaker 3>is something like passion is the enemy</v>
<v Speaker 3>of reason,</v>

371
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:57.670
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so to the degree that your rational,</v>

372
00:21:57.671 --> 00:22:00.250
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of a Friday viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's cause he got your emotions under</v>

373
00:22:00.251 --> 00:22:04.960
<v Speaker 3>control and there's some truth in that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not enough truth.</v>

374
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.690
<v Speaker 3>I like the Piagetian idea better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that,</v>

375
00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:09.370
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no that isn't what happens.</v>

376
00:22:09.371 --> 00:22:11.800
<v Speaker 3>What happens if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're playing the proper game is</v>

377
00:22:11.801 --> 00:22:15.190
<v Speaker 3>that you integrate your emotions</v>
<v Speaker 3>underneath.</v>

378
00:22:15.191 --> 00:22:18.280
<v Speaker 3>You're thinking something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're all working in the same</v>

379
00:22:18.281 --> 00:22:19.180
<v Speaker 3>direction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

380
00:22:19.181 --> 00:22:23.110
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can make your anxiety work against</v>

381
00:22:23.111 --> 00:22:26.780
<v Speaker 3>you or for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the ways I did,</v>

382
00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:29.890
<v Speaker 3>I made a program called the future</v>
<v Speaker 3>authoring program that I think helps</v>

383
00:22:29.891 --> 00:22:30.724
<v Speaker 3>people do that.</v>

384
00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:33.220
<v Speaker 3>Because one of the things you see when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking to people and they're</v>

385
00:22:33.221 --> 00:22:36.310
<v Speaker 3>trying to solve problems is that they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>afraid to face the problem.</v>

386
00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:39.220
<v Speaker 3>And so then their anxiety is working</v>
<v Speaker 3>against them.</v>

387
00:22:39.221 --> 00:22:42.970
<v Speaker 3>And you can think about it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as antagonistic to rationality.</v>

388
00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:46.480
<v Speaker 3>But then I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well why don't you think for a while</v>

389
00:22:46.481 --> 00:22:50.170
<v Speaker 3>about what your life would be like if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't face this problem?</v>

390
00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:53.860
<v Speaker 3>Because if you think that through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have a problem and you really</v>

391
00:22:53.861 --> 00:22:58.000
<v Speaker 3>think through what the consequences are</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be in three to five years of</v>

392
00:22:58.001 --> 00:23:00.640
<v Speaker 3>not facing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're going to get more afraid of</v>

393
00:23:00.641 --> 00:23:02.230
<v Speaker 3>not facing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then facing it.</v>

394
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:06.100
<v Speaker 3>And that's great because then your</v>
<v Speaker 3>anxiety instead of standing in front of</v>

395
00:23:06.101 --> 00:23:08.980
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of you having a dragon that's</v>

396
00:23:08.981 --> 00:23:11.920
<v Speaker 3>guarding the path in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you have one chasing you down the</v>

397
00:23:11.921 --> 00:23:14.890
<v Speaker 3>path from behind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a lot more useful.</v>

398
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:17.040
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

399
00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:21.940
<v Speaker 3>that's just a minimal example of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>utility of getting your emotions and</v>

400
00:23:21.941 --> 00:23:24.760
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and your thoughts aligned the same way.</v>

401
00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.880
<v Speaker 3>The same thing happens with aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

402
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.240
<v Speaker 3>one of the most common reasons that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people come and seek psychotherapy</v>

403
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:35.020
<v Speaker 3>really is because they're too agreeable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what that means is they're not</v>

404
00:23:35.021 --> 00:23:37.240
<v Speaker 3>assertive enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have an integrated their capacity</v>

405
00:23:37.241 --> 00:23:39.460
<v Speaker 3>for aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so other people can push them around</v>

406
00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.060
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're very conflict avoidant.</v>

407
00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so the consequences of that across</v>

408
00:23:46.041 --> 00:23:50.390
<v Speaker 3>time is that you don't stand up for</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself well enough and you get taken</v>

409
00:23:50.391 --> 00:23:53.330
<v Speaker 3>advantage of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that spirals badly downward.</v>

410
00:23:53.331 --> 00:23:58.331
<v Speaker 3>And so partly what you do when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing assertiveness training with people</v>

411
00:23:59.031 --> 00:24:03.950
<v Speaker 3>is you find out what they're angry about</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there are usually angalee angry if</v>

412
00:24:03.951 --> 00:24:06.470
<v Speaker 3>they're not assertive enough because</v>
<v Speaker 3>other people are taking advantage of</v>

413
00:24:06.471 --> 00:24:06.590
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

414
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:11.180
<v Speaker 3>Or You could say because they're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting their own necessities forward</v>

415
00:24:11.181 --> 00:24:13.460
<v Speaker 3>with enough force.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to distinguish between those</v>

416
00:24:13.461 --> 00:24:15.320
<v Speaker 3>two things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>

417
00:24:15.321 --> 00:24:16.920
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he try,</v>

418
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:19.940
<v Speaker 3>you get them to talk about what they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>angry about that often makes them cry</v>

419
00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:23.270
<v Speaker 3>often many times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you get them to kind of</v>

420
00:24:23.271 --> 00:24:26.180
<v Speaker 3>envision what they would want to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead,</v>

421
00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:30.140
<v Speaker 3>which they're often afraid to do because</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are afraid to think about what</v>

422
00:24:30.141 --> 00:24:33.980
<v Speaker 3>they want because that makes it more</v>
<v Speaker 3>clear when they're not getting it and</v>

423
00:24:33.981 --> 00:24:35.210
<v Speaker 3>that's painful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

424
00:24:35.211 --> 00:24:38.630
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe they're afraid of hoping so</v>
<v Speaker 3>they won't specify a clear aim.</v>

425
00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.090
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get them to think about what they</v>

426
00:24:41.091 --> 00:24:43.520
<v Speaker 3>might want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead you get them to think about the</v>

427
00:24:43.521 --> 00:24:46.670
<v Speaker 3>costs of not pursuing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you help them develop</v>

428
00:24:46.671 --> 00:24:51.671
<v Speaker 3>strategies for integrating their</v>
<v Speaker 3>aggression and with their thinking so</v>

429
00:24:52.641 --> 00:24:56.900
<v Speaker 3>that they can come up with a plan to</v>
<v Speaker 3>approach the world in a more confident</v>

430
00:24:56.901 --> 00:24:57.110
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

431
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:59.060
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone might come to me and say,</v>

432
00:24:59.061 --> 00:25:02.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm being bullied badly at work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then I'll say,</v>

433
00:25:02.421 --> 00:25:05.930
<v Speaker 3>well what are your options?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to put up with it.</v>

434
00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:07.700
<v Speaker 3>Well we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll figure that out.</v>

435
00:25:07.701 --> 00:25:09.500
<v Speaker 3>Cause maybe you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you don't have options,</v>

436
00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:13.520
<v Speaker 3>but here's how to find out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get your damn cv together so it's</v>

437
00:25:13.521 --> 00:25:14.900
<v Speaker 3>pristine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

438
00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.720
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's ready to go get over your fear of a</v>

439
00:25:17.721 --> 00:25:20.480
<v Speaker 3>new interview because it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are generally afraid of that.</v>

440
00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.850
<v Speaker 3>Get over your fear of applying for a new</v>
<v Speaker 3>job.</v>

441
00:25:22.851 --> 00:25:25.790
<v Speaker 3>Start thinking about what it would mean</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have a different job.</v>

442
00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:30.410
<v Speaker 3>Start thinking about what it would mean</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have a better job even because maybe</v>

443
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:33.650
<v Speaker 3>your fear is just making you stuck here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I can tell you one thing,</v>

444
00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:36.680
<v Speaker 3>if someone's picking on you at work and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have options,</v>

445
00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:37.873
<v Speaker 3>you lose.</v>

446
00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.970
<v Speaker 3>So you get the person to start building</v>
<v Speaker 3>a strategy.</v>

447
00:25:40.971 --> 00:25:41.804
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

448
00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:44.480
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to tell this person to</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop,</v>

449
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:48.320
<v Speaker 3>you have to know how to make them stop</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one and the one thing you need for</v>

450
00:25:48.321 --> 00:25:50.720
<v Speaker 3>sure is an option.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you can't,</v>

451
00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:54.290
<v Speaker 3>if you don't have an option,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then maybe we start thinking about the</v>

452
00:25:54.291 --> 00:25:58.010
<v Speaker 3>fact that you need some more training or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that because you cannot</v>

453
00:25:58.011 --> 00:26:01.790
<v Speaker 3>negotiate if you don't have any power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So because while,</v>

454
00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:04.820
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who's really out to get you or</v>

455
00:26:04.821 --> 00:26:07.630
<v Speaker 3>really disagreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't have a leg to stand on and</v>

456
00:26:07.631 --> 00:26:10.400
<v Speaker 3>they'll just push you over and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll jump on youtube because that's</v>

457
00:26:10.401 --> 00:26:11.920
<v Speaker 3>what they're like and they enjoy it</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyways,</v>

458
00:26:11.921 --> 00:26:16.910
<v Speaker 3>so it's no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you'll put your options behind you</v>

459
00:26:16.911 --> 00:26:18.680
<v Speaker 3>and then you start to think about</v>
<v Speaker 3>strategy.</v>

460
00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.820
<v Speaker 3>So I tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

461
00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:23.660
<v Speaker 3>if you're being harassed at work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you documented every time it happens and</v>

462
00:26:23.661 --> 00:26:26.570
<v Speaker 3>you write it down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you've got like 20 stories about it</v>

463
00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:30.050
<v Speaker 3>and it's fully documented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you go confront the person at</v>

464
00:26:30.051 --> 00:26:32.150
<v Speaker 3>some point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But with at least three pieces of</v>

465
00:26:32.151 --> 00:26:36.500
<v Speaker 3>evidence and you have some sense of what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you tell them about what will happen if</v>

466
00:26:36.501 --> 00:26:39.080
<v Speaker 3>they don't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have to figure out,</v>

467
00:26:39.081 --> 00:26:40.610
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they don't stop,</v>

468
00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:43.070
<v Speaker 3>what are you gonna do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Leave.</v>

469
00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:45.280
<v Speaker 3>Not if you can't leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>

470
00:26:45.281 --> 00:26:46.770
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be able to,</v>

471
00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.500
<v Speaker 3>what is it wield a big stick and speak</v>
<v Speaker 3>softly,</v>

472
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.210
<v Speaker 3>but you see that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

473
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:55.680
<v Speaker 3>that's how you take your aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is an absolutely necessary part of</v>

474
00:26:55.681 --> 00:27:00.681
<v Speaker 3>your psyche and manifest it up into a</v>
<v Speaker 3>sophisticated means of dealing with the</v>

475
00:27:01.231 --> 00:27:02.790
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't just suppress it.</v>

476
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:03.181
<v Speaker 3>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

477
00:27:03.181 --> 00:27:06.540
<v Speaker 3>I should be able to put up with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or I wish I wasn't so angry or</v>

478
00:27:06.541 --> 00:27:07.230
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

479
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:10.920
<v Speaker 3>forget that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all it will happen is your blood</v>

480
00:27:10.921 --> 00:27:13.740
<v Speaker 3>pressure will stay high and you'll die</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a heart attack because anger for</v>

481
00:27:13.741 --> 00:27:16.680
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very toxic emotion and it does</v>

482
00:27:16.681 --> 00:27:19.440
<v Speaker 3>cause heart damage over time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the only emotion that we really</v>

483
00:27:19.441 --> 00:27:23.550
<v Speaker 3>know that's been linked to things like</v>
<v Speaker 3>cardiovascular risk and anger is,</v>

484
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:27.030
<v Speaker 3>is toxic because it's like you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>driving a car.</v>

485
00:27:27.031 --> 00:27:28.620
<v Speaker 3>You've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're stepping on the gas and pushing</v>

486
00:27:28.621 --> 00:27:32.220
<v Speaker 3>on the brake at the same time because</v>
<v Speaker 3>anger tells you to run away and to</v>

487
00:27:32.221 --> 00:27:35.460
<v Speaker 3>attack at the same time cause you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>know what's going to happen.</v>

488
00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:39.270
<v Speaker 3>And so it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really amps up the physiological</v>

489
00:27:39.271 --> 00:27:41.610
<v Speaker 3>demand on your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you,</v>

490
00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:44.010
<v Speaker 3>including your heart and your</v>
<v Speaker 3>musculature,</v>

491
00:27:44.011 --> 00:27:46.200
<v Speaker 3>so if you stay like that for like 10</v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

492
00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:51.030
<v Speaker 3>you know you're going to age 20 years</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's a bad plan.</v>

493
00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:54.930
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>

494
00:27:54.931 --> 00:27:59.160
<v Speaker 3>you take your underground emotions and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you integrate them into a sophisticated</v>

495
00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:01.800
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now</v>

496
00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:06.090
<v Speaker 3>Young said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so first of all,</v>

497
00:28:06.091 --> 00:28:08.280
<v Speaker 3>unite your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you unite your mind.</v>

498
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:10.380
<v Speaker 3>You're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say with your emotions.</v>

499
00:28:10.381 --> 00:28:13.920
<v Speaker 3>So that makes one thing instead of two</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting things.</v>

500
00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:15.960
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good one.</v>

501
00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:20.730
<v Speaker 3>And then the next conjunction he talked</v>
<v Speaker 3>about was it isn't enough to unite your</v>

502
00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:24.030
<v Speaker 3>mind and your emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he thought about that as a male</v>

503
00:28:24.031 --> 00:28:27.210
<v Speaker 3>female pairing symbolically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that's how it would manifest itself</v>

504
00:28:27.211 --> 00:28:30.900
<v Speaker 3>sometimes in dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you take the masculine element and</v>

505
00:28:30.901 --> 00:28:35.190
<v Speaker 3>the feminine element,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thinking and the emotion unite</v>

506
00:28:35.191 --> 00:28:37.500
<v Speaker 3>those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that makes you more like one thing.</v>

507
00:28:37.501 --> 00:28:38.670
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now all of a sudden that's</v>

508
00:28:38.671 --> 00:28:41.070
<v Speaker 3>represented as symbolically mail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that one thing,</v>

509
00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:44.640
<v Speaker 3>and it unites with something else that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>now represented symbolically feminine</v>

510
00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:46.290
<v Speaker 3>female,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the body.</v>

511
00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:48.870
<v Speaker 3>So you take the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>emotion,</v>

512
00:28:48.871 --> 00:28:51.450
<v Speaker 3>integration and integrate that in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

513
00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:55.590
<v Speaker 3>So what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You act it out instead of just thinking.</v>

514
00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:58.320
<v Speaker 3>So there's this philosophical idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>called a,</v>

515
00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:02.580
<v Speaker 3>now I'm going to forget what it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>called.</v>

516
00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:06.180
<v Speaker 3>It's a contradiction in action.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's actually a technical term for</v>

517
00:29:06.181 --> 00:29:07.770
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's when you think and believe</v>

518
00:29:07.771 --> 00:29:08.604
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're,</v>

519
00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:12.000
<v Speaker 3>but you don't act it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that means there's a dissociation</v>

520
00:29:12.001 --> 00:29:17.001
<v Speaker 3>in you somehow between your abstract</v>
<v Speaker 3>representations and what you manifest in</v>

521
00:29:17.851 --> 00:29:19.830
<v Speaker 3>action.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While that's another form of</v>

522
00:29:19.831 --> 00:29:22.110
<v Speaker 3>discontinuity that isn't doing you any</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

523
00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:26.130
<v Speaker 3>You know the driver's going one way and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cars going the other and you won't</v>

524
00:29:26.131 --> 00:29:28.710
<v Speaker 3>even be able to understand yourself if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do that.</v>

525
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:31.290
<v Speaker 3>But even more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not putting your principles into</v>

526
00:29:31.291 --> 00:29:34.770
<v Speaker 3>practice so you're disassociated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're being is dissociated.</v>

527
00:29:34.771 --> 00:29:37.980
<v Speaker 3>So once you get your mind in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>emotions working together,</v>

528
00:29:37.981 --> 00:29:40.710
<v Speaker 3>then the next thing to do is to act that</v>
<v Speaker 3>out consistently.</v>

529
00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:44.020
<v Speaker 3>So that was the second conjunction as</v>
<v Speaker 3>far as young was concerned.</v>

530
00:29:44.021 --> 00:29:47.230
<v Speaker 3>And then the third one was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the tough one and this is the</v>

531
00:29:47.231 --> 00:29:52.000
<v Speaker 3>one that's related to phenomenology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You erase the distinction between</v>

532
00:29:52.001 --> 00:29:54.880
<v Speaker 3>yourself and the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

533
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:58.300
<v Speaker 3>that's a tough one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So imagine you're dealing with someone</v>

534
00:29:58.301 --> 00:30:00.220
<v Speaker 3>who's hoarding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

535
00:30:00.221 --> 00:30:04.540
<v Speaker 3>people who are hoarding are often older</v>
<v Speaker 3>or neurologically damaged or they have</v>

536
00:30:04.541 --> 00:30:07.900
<v Speaker 3>obsessive compulsive disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then you walk into their house and</v>

537
00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:10.300
<v Speaker 3>there's like 10,000 things in their</v>
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

538
00:30:10.301 --> 00:30:11.380
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

539
00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:13.480
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's maybe a hundred boxes and you</v>

540
00:30:13.481 --> 00:30:17.500
<v Speaker 3>open up a box and in the box there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>some pens and some old passports and</v>

541
00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:22.390
<v Speaker 3>some checks and their collection of</v>
<v Speaker 3>silver dollars and some hypodermic</v>

542
00:30:22.391 --> 00:30:24.280
<v Speaker 3>needles and some dustin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

543
00:30:24.281 --> 00:30:26.080
<v Speaker 3>a dead mouse and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

544
00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:30.100
<v Speaker 3>and there's boxes and boxes and boxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that in the house.</v>

545
00:30:30.101 --> 00:30:33.250
<v Speaker 3>It's absolute chaos in their absolute</v>
<v Speaker 3>chaos,</v>

546
00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:34.630
<v Speaker 3>not order chaos.</v>

547
00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.140
<v Speaker 3>And then you think is that their houses</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're being,</v>

548
00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:41.890
<v Speaker 3>is that their mind?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is there's no difference.</v>

549
00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.230
<v Speaker 3>There's no difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

550
00:30:44.231 --> 00:30:44.921
<v Speaker 3>I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

551
00:30:44.921 --> 00:30:48.400
<v Speaker 3>if you want to organize your psyche,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could start by organizing your room</v>

552
00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:50.290
<v Speaker 3>if they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that would be easier because maybe</v>

553
00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:53.260
<v Speaker 3>you're a more concrete person and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>need something concrete to do.</v>

554
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:57.340
<v Speaker 3>So you go clean up under your bed and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you make your bed and you organize the</v>

555
00:30:57.341 --> 00:31:00.580
<v Speaker 3>papers on your desk and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well just exactly what are you</v>

556
00:31:00.581 --> 00:31:03.400
<v Speaker 3>organizing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you organizing the objective world</v>

557
00:31:03.401 --> 00:31:07.210
<v Speaker 3>or are you objecting your field?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or are you organizing your field of</v>

558
00:31:07.211 --> 00:31:09.850
<v Speaker 3>being like your field of total</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience?</v>

559
00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:13.780
<v Speaker 3>And young believed that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think there's a Buddhist doctrine</v>

560
00:31:13.781 --> 00:31:17.230
<v Speaker 3>that sort of nested in there that at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>highest level of psychological</v>

561
00:31:17.231 --> 00:31:20.290
<v Speaker 3>integration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no difference between you and</v>

562
00:31:20.291 --> 00:31:21.610
<v Speaker 3>what you experience.</v>

563
00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:23.260
<v Speaker 3>Now you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

564
00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:25.600
<v Speaker 3>I can't control everything I</v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced,</v>

565
00:31:25.601 --> 00:31:28.910
<v Speaker 3>but that's no objection because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't control yourself anyways.</v>

566
00:31:28.911 --> 00:31:33.100
<v Speaker 3>So the mere fact that you can't extend</v>
<v Speaker 3>control over everything you experience</v>

567
00:31:33.101 --> 00:31:37.210
<v Speaker 3>is no argument against the idea that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>should still treat that as an extension</v>

568
00:31:37.211 --> 00:31:38.740
<v Speaker 3>of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you could say,</v>

569
00:31:38.741 --> 00:31:41.740
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say you have a longstanding feud</v>

570
00:31:41.741 --> 00:31:45.670
<v Speaker 3>with your brother while sat a</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological problem.</v>

571
00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:48.160
<v Speaker 3>Is that him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it a problem in the objective world?</v>

572
00:31:48.161 --> 00:31:51.040
<v Speaker 3>Or is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it a problem in your field of being?</v>

573
00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:54.640
<v Speaker 3>And it's very useful to think that way</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you might ask,</v>

574
00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.730
<v Speaker 3>what could you do to improve yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

575
00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:00.850
<v Speaker 3>let's step one step backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first question might be,</v>

576
00:32:00.851 --> 00:32:03.280
<v Speaker 3>why should you even bother improving</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself?</v>

577
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.010
<v Speaker 3>And I think the answer to that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like,</v>

578
00:32:06.011 --> 00:32:09.400
<v Speaker 3>so you don't suffer any more stupidly</v>
<v Speaker 3>than you have to.</v>

579
00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:11.770
<v Speaker 3>And maybe so others don't have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>

580
00:32:11.771 --> 00:32:13.240
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

581
00:32:13.241 --> 00:32:15.250
<v Speaker 3>like there's a real injunction at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bottom of it.</v>

582
00:32:15.251 --> 00:32:20.251
<v Speaker 3>It's not some casual self-help doctrine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that if you don't organize yourself</v>

583
00:32:20.381 --> 00:32:23.560
<v Speaker 3>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll pay for it and in a big way.</v>

584
00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:26.530
<v Speaker 3>And so will the people around you now</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you could say,</v>

585
00:32:26.531 --> 00:32:27.760
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care about that,</v>

586
00:32:27.761 --> 00:32:30.670
<v Speaker 3>but that's actually not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You actually do care about that because</v>

587
00:32:30.671 --> 00:32:33.010
<v Speaker 3>if you're in pain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will care about it.</v>

588
00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:36.790
<v Speaker 3>And so you do care about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if it's just that negative way,</v>

589
00:32:36.791 --> 00:32:37.850
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

590
00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:41.840
<v Speaker 3>it's very rare that you can find someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's in excruciating pain who would</v>

591
00:32:41.841 --> 00:32:43.700
<v Speaker 3>ever say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

592
00:32:43.701 --> 00:32:48.380
<v Speaker 3>it would be no better if I was out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this sort of pain is one of those things</v>

593
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:53.240
<v Speaker 3>that brings the idea that it would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>better if it didn't exist along with it.</v>

594
00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:58.360
<v Speaker 3>It's in controvertible so you get your</v>
<v Speaker 3>act together so that there isn't any</v>

595
00:32:58.371 --> 00:33:00.740
<v Speaker 3>more stupid pain around you than</v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary.</v>

596
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:02.360
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then the question might be,</v>

597
00:33:02.361 --> 00:33:04.040
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how would you go about getting your act</v>

598
00:33:04.041 --> 00:33:05.480
<v Speaker 3>together?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the answer to that,</v>

599
00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.570
<v Speaker 3>and this is a phenomenological idea too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something like,</v>

600
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:13.160
<v Speaker 3>look around for something that bothers</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and see if you can fix it.</v>

601
00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:15.890
<v Speaker 3>So now you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

602
00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:19.100
<v Speaker 3>let's say there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say you go into a,</v>

603
00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.400
<v Speaker 3>you can do this in a room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's quite fun to do it just when you're</v>

604
00:33:22.401 --> 00:33:23.780
<v Speaker 3>sitting in a room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a room,</v>

605
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:26.060
<v Speaker 3>maybe your bedroom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can sit there and just sort of</v>

606
00:33:26.061 --> 00:33:26.990
<v Speaker 3>meditate on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think,</v>

607
00:33:26.991 --> 00:33:30.380
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I wanted to spend 10 minutes making</v>

608
00:33:30.381 --> 00:33:33.350
<v Speaker 3>this room better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would I have to do?</v>

609
00:33:33.351 --> 00:33:35.060
<v Speaker 3>And you have to ask yourself that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

610
00:33:35.061 --> 00:33:37.610
<v Speaker 3>It's not a command.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like our genuine question and</v>

611
00:33:37.611 --> 00:33:41.240
<v Speaker 3>things will pop out in the room that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know you like there's a stack of papers</v>

612
00:33:41.241 --> 00:33:44.390
<v Speaker 3>over there that's kind of bugging you</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know that maybe little order</v>

613
00:33:44.391 --> 00:33:46.730
<v Speaker 3>there would be a good thing and you know</v>
<v Speaker 3>you haven't,</v>

614
00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:50.300
<v Speaker 3>there's some rubbish behind your</v>
<v Speaker 3>computer monitor that you haven't</v>

615
00:33:50.301 --> 00:33:54.230
<v Speaker 3>attended to for like six months and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>room would be slightly better if it was</v>

616
00:33:54.231 --> 00:33:57.290
<v Speaker 3>a little less dusty in the cables</v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't all tangled up the same way.</v>

617
00:33:57.290 --> 00:34:02.090
<v Speaker 3>And like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you allow yourself just to consider</v>

618
00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:05.720
<v Speaker 3>the expanse in which you exist at that</v>
<v Speaker 3>moment,</v>

619
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:09.650
<v Speaker 3>there'll be all sorts of things that'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>pop out in it that you could just fix.</v>

620
00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:11.630
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might say,</v>

621
00:34:11.631 --> 00:34:14.180
<v Speaker 3>well if you were coming to see me for</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychotherapy,</v>

622
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:18.050
<v Speaker 3>this easiest thing for us to do first</v>
<v Speaker 3>would just be to get you to organize</v>

623
00:34:18.051 --> 00:34:19.340
<v Speaker 3>your room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>

624
00:34:19.341 --> 00:34:21.740
<v Speaker 3>well is that psychotherapy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is,</v>

625
00:34:21.741 --> 00:34:24.440
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it depends on how you conceive the</v>

626
00:34:24.441 --> 00:34:29.441
<v Speaker 3>limits of your being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would say start where you can</v>

627
00:34:29.541 --> 00:34:30.800
<v Speaker 3>start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

628
00:34:30.970 --> 00:34:33.590
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if something announces itself to you,</v>

629
00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:35.450
<v Speaker 3>which is a strange way of thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

630
00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.870
<v Speaker 3>as in need of repair that you could</v>
<v Speaker 3>repair,</v>

631
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.940
<v Speaker 3>then hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fix it.</v>

632
00:34:41.390 --> 00:34:45.290
<v Speaker 3>You fix a hundred things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your life will be a lot different.</v>

633
00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:48.620
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I often tell people to fix the things</v>

634
00:34:48.621 --> 00:34:52.130
<v Speaker 3>you repeat every day because people tend</v>
<v Speaker 3>to think of those as trivial,</v>

635
00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:53.323
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

636
00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:55.160
<v Speaker 3>You get up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you brush your teeth,</v>

637
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:56.900
<v Speaker 3>you have your breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you,</v>

638
00:34:56.901 --> 00:34:59.180
<v Speaker 3>you have your routines that you go</v>
<v Speaker 3>through every day.</v>

639
00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:02.930
<v Speaker 3>Well though those probably constitute</v>
<v Speaker 3>50% of your life.</v>

640
00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:04.071
<v Speaker 3>And people think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

641
00:35:04.071 --> 00:35:05.990
<v Speaker 3>they're mundane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to pay attention to them.</v>

642
00:35:05.991 --> 00:35:06.501
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

643
00:35:06.501 --> 00:35:07.640
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly wrong.</v>

644
00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:11.060
<v Speaker 3>The things you do every day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are the most important things you</v>

645
00:35:11.061 --> 00:35:14.390
<v Speaker 3>do hands down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All you have to do is do the arithmetic.</v>

646
00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:20.010
<v Speaker 3>You figure it out right away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a hundred adjustments to your broader</v>

647
00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:23.930
<v Speaker 3>domain of being and there's a lot less</v>
<v Speaker 3>rubbish.</v>

648
00:35:23.931 --> 00:35:26.650
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot of less rubbish around</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

649
00:35:26.651 --> 00:35:31.651
<v Speaker 3>a lot fewer traps for you to step into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's in keeping with ewing's</v>

650
00:35:32.601 --> 00:35:36.620
<v Speaker 3>idea about erasing the dis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you've got your mind and your</v>

651
00:35:36.621 --> 00:35:39.330
<v Speaker 3>emotions together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and once you're acting that out,</v>

652
00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:44.660
<v Speaker 3>then you can extend what you're willing</v>
<v Speaker 3>to consider yourself and start fixing up</v>

653
00:35:45.361 --> 00:35:48.720
<v Speaker 3>the things that are part of your broader</v>
<v Speaker 3>extent.</v>

654
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:50.460
<v Speaker 3>Now sometimes you don't know how to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

655
00:35:50.461 --> 00:35:52.920
<v Speaker 3>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine you're walking down bloor street</v>

656
00:35:52.921 --> 00:35:56.610
<v Speaker 3>and there's this guy who's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>alcoholic and schizophrenia and has been</v>

657
00:35:56.611 --> 00:35:59.580
<v Speaker 3>on the streets for 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He sorta stumbled towards you and you</v>

658
00:35:59.581 --> 00:36:01.590
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>incoherently mutters something.</v>

659
00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:06.150
<v Speaker 3>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it would be good if you could fix</v>

660
00:36:06.151 --> 00:36:07.770
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you haven't got a clue about how to</v>

661
00:36:07.771 --> 00:36:11.490
<v Speaker 3>fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just walk around that and go find</v>

662
00:36:11.491 --> 00:36:14.490
<v Speaker 3>something that you could fix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you muck about in that,</v>

663
00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:17.220
<v Speaker 3>not only is it unlikely that you'll help</v>
<v Speaker 3>that person,</v>

664
00:36:17.221 --> 00:36:19.530
<v Speaker 3>it's very likely that you'll get hurt</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>

665
00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:23.610
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because while you're experiencing</v>

666
00:36:23.611 --> 00:36:26.280
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>announced themselves as in need of</v>

667
00:36:26.281 --> 00:36:27.810
<v Speaker 3>repair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't mean that it's,</v>

668
00:36:27.811 --> 00:36:30.390
<v Speaker 3>you write that in there that should</v>
<v Speaker 3>repair them.</v>

669
00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:32.790
<v Speaker 3>You have to have some humility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

670
00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:36.060
<v Speaker 3>you don't walk up to a helicopter that</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't working and just start tinkering</v>

671
00:36:36.061 --> 00:36:36.894
<v Speaker 3>away with it.</v>

672
00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:39.480
<v Speaker 3>You have to stay within your domain of</v>
<v Speaker 3>competence.</v>

673
00:36:39.481 --> 00:36:42.210
<v Speaker 3>But most of the time if people look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>their lives,</v>

674
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:45.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very interesting thing to do.</v>

675
00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:48.450
<v Speaker 3>I liked the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked the idea of the room because you</v>

676
00:36:48.451 --> 00:36:50.620
<v Speaker 3>can do that at the drop of a hat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

677
00:36:50.621 --> 00:36:52.650
<v Speaker 3>we'd go back to where you live and sit</v>
<v Speaker 3>down and think,</v>

678
00:36:52.651 --> 00:36:55.380
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to make this place better for</v>

679
00:36:55.381 --> 00:36:59.970
<v Speaker 3>half an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What should I do it they have to ask and</v>

680
00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:03.870
<v Speaker 3>things will just pop up like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's partly because your mind is a</v>

681
00:37:03.871 --> 00:37:06.090
<v Speaker 3>very strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you give it a name,</v>

682
00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:10.110
<v Speaker 3>a genuine aim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll reconfigure the world in keeping</v>

683
00:37:10.111 --> 00:37:13.140
<v Speaker 3>with that aim that that's actually how</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see to begin with.</v>

684
00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.770
<v Speaker 3>And so if you set it a task,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you have to be genuine</v>

685
00:37:16.771 --> 00:37:18.870
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why you have to bring your</v>

686
00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:22.830
<v Speaker 3>thoughts and emotions together and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to get them into your body so</v>

687
00:37:22.831 --> 00:37:26.250
<v Speaker 3>you're acting consistently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be genuine about the aim.</v>

688
00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:30.300
<v Speaker 3>But once you aim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world will reconfigure itself around</v>

689
00:37:30.301 --> 00:37:32.700
<v Speaker 3>that aim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is very strange and,</v>

690
00:37:32.701 --> 00:37:34.200
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

691
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.990
<v Speaker 3>it's technically true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

692
00:37:36.991 --> 00:37:41.100
<v Speaker 3>the best example of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have all seen this video where you</v>

693
00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:46.200
<v Speaker 3>watch the basketballs being tossed back</v>
<v Speaker 3>and forth between members of the white</v>

694
00:37:46.201 --> 00:37:48.840
<v Speaker 3>team versus the black team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And well,</v>

695
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:51.150
<v Speaker 3>you're doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A gorilla walks up into the middle of</v>

696
00:37:51.151 --> 00:37:52.830
<v Speaker 3>the video and you don't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

697
00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you thought about that experiment for</v>

698
00:37:55.201 --> 00:37:57.570
<v Speaker 3>about five years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be about the right amount of</v>

699
00:37:57.571 --> 00:38:00.540
<v Speaker 3>time to spend thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because what it shows you is that you</v>

700
00:38:00.541 --> 00:38:05.130
<v Speaker 3>see what you aim at and that man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can get one thing through your</v>

701
00:38:05.131 --> 00:38:08.430
<v Speaker 3>head and as a consequence of even being</v>
<v Speaker 3>in university,</v>

702
00:38:08.431 --> 00:38:10.530
<v Speaker 3>that would be a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see what you a at.</v>

703
00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:15.830
<v Speaker 3>And so because one</v>
<v Speaker 3>inference you might draw from that is be</v>

704
00:38:16.201 --> 00:38:19.170
<v Speaker 3>careful what you aim at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Write it.</v>

705
00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:22.980
<v Speaker 3>What you aim at determines the way the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world manifests itself to you.</v>

706
00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:27.750
<v Speaker 3>And so if the world is manifesting</v>
<v Speaker 3>itself in a very negative way,</v>

707
00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:31.380
<v Speaker 3>one thing to ask is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you aiming at the right thing?</v>

708
00:38:31.381 --> 00:38:32.131
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

709
00:38:32.131 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to reduce everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 3>problems to an improper aim.</v>

710
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:38.770
<v Speaker 3>People get cut off at the knees for all</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorts of reasons.</v>

711
00:38:38.771 --> 00:38:39.790
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get sick,</v>

712
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:42.840
<v Speaker 3>they have accidents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a random element to being,</v>

713
00:38:42.841 --> 00:38:44.290
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

714
00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:48.190
<v Speaker 3>and so you don't want to take anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even that particular phrase too far.</v>

715
00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:52.030
<v Speaker 3>You want to bind it with the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 3>random things do happen to people.</v>

716
00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:54.970
<v Speaker 3>But it's still a great thing to ask.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

717
00:38:54.971 --> 00:38:58.090
<v Speaker 3>So Rogers was a phenomenologist and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was interested in,</v>

718
00:38:58.450 --> 00:39:03.450
<v Speaker 3>he didn't start his philosophy from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective of subject versus object or</v>

719
00:39:04.361 --> 00:39:07.870
<v Speaker 3>from the idea of psyche,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like sort of inside you,</v>

720
00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:09.580
<v Speaker 3>your mind with its layers.</v>

721
00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:14.080
<v Speaker 3>That's not how we looked at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so let's go through,</v>

722
00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:17.800
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll introduce you to rogers.</v>

723
00:39:17.801 --> 00:39:19.630
<v Speaker 3>I think I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we'll talk about it more next</v>

724
00:39:19.631 --> 00:39:22.630
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to start with something that I</v>

725
00:39:22.631 --> 00:39:26.290
<v Speaker 3>learned from him that I think it was of</v>
<v Speaker 3>crucial importance and so we'll set the</v>

726
00:39:26.291 --> 00:39:29.080
<v Speaker 3>stage for the further discussion with</v>
<v Speaker 3>with this,</v>

727
00:39:29.081 --> 00:39:34.060
<v Speaker 3>and I'm going to read it to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>assuming a minimal mutual willingness to</v>

728
00:39:34.061 --> 00:39:36.370
<v Speaker 3>be in contact and to receive</v>
<v Speaker 3>communications,</v>

729
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:40.420
<v Speaker 3>we may say that the greater the commuted</v>
<v Speaker 3>con communicated congruence of</v>

730
00:39:40.421 --> 00:39:45.070
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>awareness and behavior on the part of</v>

731
00:39:45.071 --> 00:39:47.830
<v Speaker 3>one individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The more the ensuing relationship will</v>

732
00:39:47.831 --> 00:39:51.850
<v Speaker 3>involve a tendency towards reciprocal</v>
<v Speaker 3>communication with the same qualities,</v>

733
00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:56.080
<v Speaker 3>mutually accurate understanding of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>communication's improved psychological</v>

734
00:39:56.081 --> 00:39:59.590
<v Speaker 3>adjustment and functioning in both</v>
<v Speaker 3>parties and mutual satisfaction in the</v>

735
00:39:59.591 --> 00:40:02.020
<v Speaker 3>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's quite a mouthful.</v>

736
00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:05.920
<v Speaker 3>What does it mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Assuming a minimal mutual willingness to</v>

737
00:40:05.921 --> 00:40:08.320
<v Speaker 3>be in contact and to receive</v>
<v Speaker 3>communications.</v>

738
00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:10.480
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're having a conversation.</v>

739
00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:14.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm deciding I'm going to listen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

740
00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:17.950
<v Speaker 3>That's different than the people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how people generally communicate.</v>

741
00:40:17.951 --> 00:40:21.160
<v Speaker 3>Because usually when they communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing something like,</v>

742
00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:23.560
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have a conversation and</v>

743
00:40:23.561 --> 00:40:26.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to tell you why I'm right and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all win.</v>

744
00:40:26.621 --> 00:40:30.190
<v Speaker 3>If you agree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe you're having a conversation</v>

745
00:40:30.191 --> 00:40:31.960
<v Speaker 3>where I don't know what you're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

746
00:40:31.961 --> 00:40:34.630
<v Speaker 3>maybe you're trying to impress the</v>
<v Speaker 3>person you're talking to so you're not</v>

747
00:40:34.631 --> 00:40:36.340
<v Speaker 3>listening to them at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just thinking about what you're</v>

748
00:40:36.341 --> 00:40:37.990
<v Speaker 3>gonna say next.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

749
00:40:37.991 --> 00:40:40.300
<v Speaker 3>so that's not this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

750
00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:45.540
<v Speaker 3>you might have something to tell me and</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm going to listen on the off chance</v>

751
00:40:46.511 --> 00:40:49.390
<v Speaker 3>that you'll tell me something that would</v>
<v Speaker 3>really be useful for me to know.</v>

752
00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:53.620
<v Speaker 3>And so you could take about it as an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as an extension of the Piagetian.</v>

753
00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:59.920
<v Speaker 3>Piaget talks about the fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fundamentally important element of</v>

754
00:40:59.921 --> 00:41:02.680
<v Speaker 3>knowledge being to describe how</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge is sought,</v>

755
00:41:02.681 --> 00:41:04.600
<v Speaker 3>the process by which knowledge is</v>
<v Speaker 3>generated.</v>

756
00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:08.470
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you agree with me and I find that</v>

757
00:41:08.471 --> 00:41:10.360
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know nothing more than I knew before.</v>

758
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:14.170
<v Speaker 3>I just know what I knew before and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy about that because you know,</v>

759
00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:17.380
<v Speaker 3>it didn't get challenged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm no smarter than I was before,</v>

760
00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:20.500
<v Speaker 3>but maybe you're different than me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so while I'm listening to you'll</v>

761
00:41:20.501 --> 00:41:22.360
<v Speaker 3>tell me something I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like,</v>

762
00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:25.510
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's something I find contemptible</v>
<v Speaker 3>or difficult,</v>

763
00:41:25.511 --> 00:41:27.040
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you'll find,</v>

764
00:41:27.041 --> 00:41:31.120
<v Speaker 3>you'll tell me something I don't know</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I won't be quite as stupid and</v>

765
00:41:31.121 --> 00:41:34.580
<v Speaker 3>then maybe I won't run painfully quite</v>
<v Speaker 3>as many things.</v>

766
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:36.770
<v Speaker 3>And that's a really useful thing to</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

767
00:41:36.771 --> 00:41:40.660
<v Speaker 3>especially if you live with someone and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to make longterm piece</v>

768
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:42.440
<v Speaker 3>with them is they are not the same as</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

769
00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:45.890
<v Speaker 3>And they're way they look at the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the facts that they pull out of the</v>

770
00:41:45.891 --> 00:41:47.510
<v Speaker 3>world aren't the same as your facts.</v>

771
00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:52.220
<v Speaker 3>And even though you're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>overwhelmed with the proclivity to</v>

772
00:41:52.221 --> 00:41:55.910
<v Speaker 3>demonstrate that you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is the case that two brains are</v>

773
00:41:55.911 --> 00:42:00.650
<v Speaker 3>better than one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so maybe nine of the 10 things they</v>

774
00:42:00.651 --> 00:42:05.651
<v Speaker 3>tell you are dispensable or maybe even</v>
<v Speaker 3>49 out of 50 but one thing,</v>

775
00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:09.320
<v Speaker 3>all you need to get out of the damn</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation is one thing you don't</v>

776
00:42:09.321 --> 00:42:11.720
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that's very cool</v>

777
00:42:11.721 --> 00:42:16.520
<v Speaker 3>about a good psychotherapeutic session</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the whole conversation is like</v>

778
00:42:16.521 --> 00:42:21.521
<v Speaker 3>that all you're doing is trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>express the truth of the situation as</v>

779
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:26.390
<v Speaker 3>clearly as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

780
00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:32.200
<v Speaker 3>And so now rogers' proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'll tell you why he derived it,</v>

781
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:38.300
<v Speaker 3>was that if you have a conversation like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that with someone,</v>

782
00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:42.130
<v Speaker 3>it will make both of you better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll make both of you is</v>

783
00:42:42.131 --> 00:42:45.470
<v Speaker 3>psychologically healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's an implicit presupposition</v>

784
00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:48.830
<v Speaker 3>that the exchange of truth is curative.</v>

785
00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:50.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a very cool idea.</v>

786
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:52.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very deep idea.</v>

787
00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:56.690
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the most profound idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the,</v>

788
00:42:56.750 --> 00:43:00.560
<v Speaker 3>it's the idea upon western civil upon</v>
<v Speaker 3>which Western civilization,</v>

789
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:04.970
<v Speaker 3>although not only Western civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is actually predicated the idea that</v>

790
00:43:04.971 --> 00:43:07.580
<v Speaker 3>truth produces health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for Rogers,</v>

791
00:43:07.581 --> 00:43:10.220
<v Speaker 3>that was the entire purpose of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>psycho therapeutic alliance.</v>

792
00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:13.100
<v Speaker 3>You come to see me because you want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be better.</v>

793
00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:16.610
<v Speaker 3>You don't even know what that means</v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily.</v>

794
00:43:16.611 --> 00:43:19.100
<v Speaker 3>Neither do I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to figure that out together.</v>

795
00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:20.810
<v Speaker 3>But you come and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

796
00:43:20.811 --> 00:43:24.830
<v Speaker 3>things are not acceptable to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And maybe there's something I could do</v>

797
00:43:24.831 --> 00:43:27.230
<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the minimal precondition to</v>

798
00:43:27.231 --> 00:43:29.600
<v Speaker 3>engage in therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something's wrong.</v>

799
00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:33.020
<v Speaker 3>You're willing to talk about it</v>
<v Speaker 3>truthfully and you want it to be better.</v>

800
00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:36.470
<v Speaker 3>Without that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the therapeutic relationship does not</v>

801
00:43:36.471 --> 00:43:38.660
<v Speaker 3>get off the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then you might ask,</v>

802
00:43:38.661 --> 00:43:41.000
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what relationships are therapeutic and</v>

803
00:43:41.001 --> 00:43:44.090
<v Speaker 3>answer that would be if you have a real</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship,</v>

804
00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:45.140
<v Speaker 3>it's therapeutic.</v>

805
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:48.050
<v Speaker 3>If it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you have is not a relationship.</v>

806
00:43:48.051 --> 00:43:50.480
<v Speaker 3>God only knows what you have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a slave,</v>

807
00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:53.570
<v Speaker 3>they're a tyrant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you're both butting heads with</v>

808
00:43:53.571 --> 00:43:55.970
<v Speaker 3>one another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a primate dominance hierarchy</v>

809
00:43:55.971 --> 00:43:57.350
<v Speaker 3>dispute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

810
00:43:57.351 --> 00:43:59.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like two cats in a barrel or two</v>

811
00:43:59.361 --> 00:44:01.610
<v Speaker 3>people with their hands around each</v>
<v Speaker 3>other's throats.</v>

812
00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:06.470
<v Speaker 3>But what you have is not a relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all right,</v>

813
00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:10.010
<v Speaker 3>we may say that the greater the</v>
<v Speaker 3>communicated congruence of experience,</v>

814
00:44:10.011 --> 00:44:12.470
<v Speaker 3>awareness and behavior on the part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>one individual,</v>

815
00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:15.170
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a reference to the same idea that</v>

816
00:44:15.171 --> 00:44:20.171
<v Speaker 3>I was describing with regards to yoke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's say you come and talk to me and</v>

817
00:44:20.301 --> 00:44:22.760
<v Speaker 3>you want things to go well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I'm going to have to more or less</v>

818
00:44:22.761 --> 00:44:25.820
<v Speaker 3>be one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if I'm all over the place,</v>

819
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:29.450
<v Speaker 3>you can't trust any continuity in what I</v>
<v Speaker 3>say.</v>

820
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:30.860
<v Speaker 3>There's no end.</v>

821
00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:34.500
<v Speaker 3>There's no reason for you to believe</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'm capable of actually telling you</v>

822
00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:37.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm capable of expressing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

823
00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:42.150
<v Speaker 3>So the truth is something that emerges</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a consequences of getting yourself</v>

824
00:44:42.151 --> 00:44:46.560
<v Speaker 3>lined up and beating all the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you call</v>

825
00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:51.300
<v Speaker 3>all the impurities out of your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of your,</v>

826
00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:55.200
<v Speaker 3>out of your soul for black of a better</v>
<v Speaker 3>word.</v>

827
00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:57.660
<v Speaker 3>You have to be integrated for that to</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

828
00:44:57.661 --> 00:45:00.240
<v Speaker 3>And you do that at least in part by</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanting to tell the truth.</v>

829
00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:04.980
<v Speaker 3>The more the ensuing relationship will</v>
<v Speaker 3>involve a tendency towards reciprocal</v>

830
00:45:04.981 --> 00:45:09.630
<v Speaker 3>communication with the same qualities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things that I've been</v>

831
00:45:09.631 --> 00:45:12.510
<v Speaker 3>quite influenced by Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I tried to do in my</v>

832
00:45:12.511 --> 00:45:17.270
<v Speaker 3>therapeutic sessions is first of all to</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to really listen and then well,</v>

833
00:45:17.271 --> 00:45:20.310
<v Speaker 3>well I listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watch and well I'm listening.</v>

834
00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:22.890
<v Speaker 3>Things will happen in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

835
00:45:22.891 --> 00:45:26.310
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'll get a little image of</v>
<v Speaker 3>something or I'll get a thought or a</v>

836
00:45:26.311 --> 00:45:29.280
<v Speaker 3>question will emerge and then I'll just</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell the person what that is.</v>

837
00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:31.020
<v Speaker 3>But it's sort of directionless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

838
00:45:31.021 --> 00:45:34.590
<v Speaker 3>It's not like I have a goal except that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to make things better.</v>

839
00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:38.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm on the side of the person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on the side of the part of the</v>

840
00:45:38.071 --> 00:45:40.920
<v Speaker 3>person that wants things to be better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not worse.</v>

841
00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:45.540
<v Speaker 3>And so then those parts of us have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>dialogue and the consequence of that</v>

842
00:45:45.541 --> 00:45:48.810
<v Speaker 3>dialogue is that certain things take</v>
<v Speaker 3>place and then I'll just tell the person</v>

843
00:45:48.811 --> 00:45:51.360
<v Speaker 3>what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it isn't that I'm right.</v>

844
00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:55.050
<v Speaker 3>That's not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The point is is that they get to have an</v>

845
00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:57.810
<v Speaker 3>hour where someone actually tells them</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they think.</v>

846
00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:00.900
<v Speaker 3>Here's the impact you're having on me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

847
00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:03.840
<v Speaker 3>this is making me angry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is making me happy.</v>

848
00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:06.720
<v Speaker 3>This is really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This reminds me of something that you</v>

849
00:46:06.721 --> 00:46:09.010
<v Speaker 3>said an hour ago that I don't quite</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>

850
00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:13.740
<v Speaker 3>And the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole point is not for either person</v>

851
00:46:13.741 --> 00:46:18.540
<v Speaker 3>to make the proposition or convince the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other that their position is correct,</v>

852
00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:23.690
<v Speaker 3>but merely to have an exchange of</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience about how things are set up.</v>

853
00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:28.320
<v Speaker 3>And it's extraordinarily useful for</v>
<v Speaker 3>people because it's often difficult for</v>

854
00:46:28.321 --> 00:46:31.320
<v Speaker 3>anyone to find anyone to talk to that</v>
<v Speaker 3>will actually listen.</v>

855
00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:35.220
<v Speaker 3>And so another thing that's really</v>
<v Speaker 3>strange about this listening is that if</v>

856
00:46:35.221 --> 00:46:37.590
<v Speaker 3>you listen to people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will tell you the weirdest bloody</v>

857
00:46:37.591 --> 00:46:40.350
<v Speaker 3>things so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just cannot believe it.</v>

858
00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:43.500
<v Speaker 3>So if you're having a conversation with</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone and it's dull,</v>

859
00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:47.760
<v Speaker 3>it's because you're stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you're not listening to them</v>

860
00:46:47.761 --> 00:46:52.170
<v Speaker 3>properly because they're weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like wombats or albatrosses or</v>

861
00:46:52.171 --> 00:46:55.170
<v Speaker 3>rhinoceroses or something like they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>strange creatures.</v>

862
00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:58.680
<v Speaker 3>And so if you are actually communicating</v>
<v Speaker 3>with them and they were telling you how</v>

863
00:46:58.681 --> 00:47:00.750
<v Speaker 3>weird they really are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be,</v>

864
00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:04.020
<v Speaker 3>it would be anything but boring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

865
00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:06.960
<v Speaker 3>and you can ask questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a really good way of listening.</v>

866
00:47:06.961 --> 00:47:09.900
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of Roger's points is,</v>

867
00:47:09.901 --> 00:47:11.520
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be oriented properly in</v>

868
00:47:11.521 --> 00:47:12.354
<v Speaker 3>order to listen.</v>

869
00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:15.450
<v Speaker 3>And the orientation has to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look what I want out of this</v>

870
00:47:15.451 --> 00:47:19.050
<v Speaker 3>conversation is that the place we both</v>
<v Speaker 3>end up is better than the place we left.</v>

871
00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:21.300
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm after.</v>

872
00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:24.300
<v Speaker 3>And if you're not after that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to think why the hell</v>

873
00:47:24.301 --> 00:47:27.720
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't you be after that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What could you possibly be after that</v>

874
00:47:27.721 --> 00:47:31.780
<v Speaker 3>would be better than that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You walk away smarter and more well</v>

875
00:47:31.781 --> 00:47:35.500
<v Speaker 3>equipped for the world than you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>before you had the conversation.</v>

876
00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:38.920
<v Speaker 3>And so does the other person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well maybe if you're bitter and</v>

877
00:47:38.921 --> 00:47:41.410
<v Speaker 3>resentful and angry and anxious and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

878
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:45.070
<v Speaker 3>generally annoyed at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that isn't what you want.</v>

879
00:47:45.071 --> 00:47:48.610
<v Speaker 3>You want the other person to walk away</v>
<v Speaker 3>worse than Youtube because you're full</v>

880
00:47:48.611 --> 00:47:52.330
<v Speaker 3>of revenge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know you'll get what you want if</v>

881
00:47:52.331 --> 00:47:56.920
<v Speaker 3>you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we know from our research that such</v>

882
00:47:56.950 --> 00:48:00.730
<v Speaker 3>empathic understanding is already</v>
<v Speaker 3>defined that I want to hear you.</v>

883
00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:04.330
<v Speaker 3>I want to hear what you have to say so</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can clarify it and move forward.</v>

884
00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:07.570
<v Speaker 3>I want to have your best interests in</v>
<v Speaker 3>mind and mine as well.</v>

885
00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:10.960
<v Speaker 3>But you know both at the same time and</v>
<v Speaker 3>your families too.</v>

886
00:48:10.961 --> 00:48:13.870
<v Speaker 3>If we could manage that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're after making things better.</v>

887
00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:17.410
<v Speaker 3>We know from our research that such</v>
<v Speaker 3>empathic understanding,</v>

888
00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:19.630
<v Speaker 3>understanding with a person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not about him.</v>

889
00:48:19.631 --> 00:48:22.510
<v Speaker 3>It's such an effective approach that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>can bring about major changes in</v>

890
00:48:22.511 --> 00:48:25.480
<v Speaker 3>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of you may be feeling that you</v>

891
00:48:25.481 --> 00:48:28.270
<v Speaker 3>listen well to people and that you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>never seen such results.</v>

892
00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:32.170
<v Speaker 3>The chances are very great that you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>not been listening in the manner that</v>

893
00:48:32.171 --> 00:48:33.790
<v Speaker 3>I've described.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fortunately,</v>

894
00:48:33.791 --> 00:48:37.750
<v Speaker 3>I can suggest a little experiment that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do to test the quality of your</v>

895
00:48:37.751 --> 00:48:40.480
<v Speaker 3>understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The next time you get into an argument</v>

896
00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:44.020
<v Speaker 3>with your wife or your friend or a small</v>
<v Speaker 3>group of friends stopped the discussion</v>

897
00:48:44.021 --> 00:48:47.080
<v Speaker 3>for a moment and for an experiment</v>
<v Speaker 3>institute this rule.</v>

898
00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:52.990
<v Speaker 3>Each person can speak up for himself</v>
<v Speaker 3>only after he has first restated the</v>

899
00:48:52.991 --> 00:48:57.280
<v Speaker 3>ideas and feelings of the previous</v>
<v Speaker 3>speaker accurately would accurately</v>

900
00:48:57.281 --> 00:49:00.310
<v Speaker 3>means is they have to agree with your</v>
<v Speaker 3>restatement.</v>

901
00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:04.660
<v Speaker 3>Now that's an annoying thing to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if someone is talking to you and</v>

902
00:49:04.661 --> 00:49:06.880
<v Speaker 3>you disagree with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first thing you want to do is take</v>

903
00:49:06.881 --> 00:49:09.370
<v Speaker 3>their argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make the stupidest possible thing out of</v>

904
00:49:09.371 --> 00:49:11.560
<v Speaker 3>it that you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the straw man,</v>

905
00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:15.310
<v Speaker 3>and then demolish it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like so then you can walk away</v>

906
00:49:15.311 --> 00:49:19.960
<v Speaker 3>feeling good about it and you know you</v>
<v Speaker 3>primate diamonds dominated them really</v>

907
00:49:19.961 --> 00:49:20.794
<v Speaker 3>nicely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

908
00:49:21.310 --> 00:49:22.690
<v Speaker 3>but that isn't what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say,</v>

909
00:49:22.691 --> 00:49:24.490
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I'm going to take what you told me</v>

910
00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:27.670
<v Speaker 3>and maybe I'm even going to make your</v>
<v Speaker 3>argument stronger than the one you made.</v>

911
00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:30.520
<v Speaker 3>That's useful if you're dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone that you have to live with</v>

912
00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:33.340
<v Speaker 3>because maybe they can't bloody well</v>
<v Speaker 3>express themselves very well,</v>

913
00:49:33.341 --> 00:49:37.320
<v Speaker 3>but they have something to say so you</v>
<v Speaker 3>make their argument strong.</v>

914
00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:40.480
<v Speaker 3>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you see what this would mean.</v>

915
00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:43.630
<v Speaker 3>It would mean that before presenting</v>
<v Speaker 3>your own point of view,</v>

916
00:49:43.631 --> 00:49:46.750
<v Speaker 3>it'd be necessary for you to really</v>
<v Speaker 3>achieve the other speakers frame of</v>

917
00:49:46.751 --> 00:49:50.530
<v Speaker 3>reference to understand his thoughts and</v>
<v Speaker 3>feelings so well that you could</v>

918
00:49:50.531 --> 00:49:53.140
<v Speaker 3>summarize them for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sounds simple,</v>

919
00:49:53.141 --> 00:49:55.540
<v Speaker 3>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you will try it,</v>

920
00:49:55.541 --> 00:49:59.080
<v Speaker 3>you'll find that it's the most difficult</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that you've ever done.</v>

921
00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:00.610
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

922
00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:02.650
<v Speaker 3>We'll leave it at that and then we'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>see you on Tuesday.</v>
