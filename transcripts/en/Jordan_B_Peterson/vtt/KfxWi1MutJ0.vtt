<v Speaker 1>Hi there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only about a week before Christmas </v>

2
00:00:04.071 --> 00:00:04.904
<v Speaker 1>and some of you are no doubt scrambling </v>
<v Speaker 1>to determine what might make an </v>

3
00:00:08.631 --> 00:00:13.100
<v Speaker 1>appropriate Christmas gift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you may know or also may not.</v>

4
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:13.963
<v Speaker 1>I have written a book that's coming out </v>
<v Speaker 1>in January on January 23rd as a matter </v>

5
00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:22.301
<v Speaker 1>of fact called 12 rules for life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>antidote to chaos and it's possible that</v>

6
00:00:22.341 --> 00:00:25.760
<v Speaker 1>some of the people you know might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in receiving that as a gift.</v>

7
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.360
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a promise to get a book a month later,</v>

8
00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:31.520
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make a great Christmas gift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

9
00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:32.354
<v Speaker 1>So what I've done is put together a </v>
<v Speaker 1>small package that announces that the </v>

10
00:00:36.771 --> 00:00:37.604
<v Speaker 1>book has been ordered that has a short </v>
<v Speaker 1>letter in it for me and also that </v>

11
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.710
<v Speaker 1>contains the introduction to the book </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 10 pages,</v>

12
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.610
<v Speaker 1>which I called over tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could order the book online from any</v>

13
00:00:49.611 --> 00:00:54.080
<v Speaker 1>of the vendors to whom I have provided a</v>
<v Speaker 1>link in the description of the video and</v>

14
00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:54.914
<v Speaker 1>you could also download the package I </v>
<v Speaker 1>produced and print it out to make the </v>

15
00:00:58.281 --> 00:01:02.840
<v Speaker 1>gift more tangible and therefore more </v>
<v Speaker 1>well solid and appreciated,</v>

16
00:01:02.841 --> 00:01:05.600
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you could put it in an envelope</v>

17
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.900
<v Speaker 1>and you can give that little package as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a gift,</v>

18
00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:09.734
<v Speaker 1>and maybe that would be more appropriate</v>
<v Speaker 1>than a mere indication that the book is </v>

19
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:17.510
<v Speaker 1>on its way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I hope that's useful.</v>

20
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.790
<v Speaker 1>Thank you all for tuning in over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last year and before that,</v>

21
00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:23.624
<v Speaker 1>and for all the support you've offered </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be in the last year and a merry </v>

22
00:01:27.411 --> 00:01:28.760
<v Speaker 1>Christmas and happy new year.</v>

23
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.923
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
