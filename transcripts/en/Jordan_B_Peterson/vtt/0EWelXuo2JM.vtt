1
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.170
<v Speaker 1>I think of all the stories that we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigated so far,</v>

2
00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:41.490
<v Speaker 1>all the fundamental and myths of</v>
<v Speaker 1>creation that we've investigated so far.</v>

3
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.600
<v Speaker 1>The two that we're going to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>in detail today are probably the two</v>

4
00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:49.680
<v Speaker 1>stories that have had more impact on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>course of world history than any other</v>

5
00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:52.170
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk in some detail today</v>

6
00:00:52.171 --> 00:00:55.050
<v Speaker 1>about the story of creation laid out in</v>
<v Speaker 1>genesis,</v>

7
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.690
<v Speaker 1>genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also the story of the Buddha's</v>

8
00:00:57.691 --> 00:01:00.600
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both stories are also characterized by a</v>

9
00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:05.601
<v Speaker 1>kind of depth that's virtually limitless</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think in some ways that the topics</v>

10
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:11.601
<v Speaker 1>we're going to discuss today are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most enlightening of all the many ideas</v>

11
00:01:13.981 --> 00:01:18.981
<v Speaker 1>that we've traveled through so far in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this series.</v>

12
00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:24.411
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to be concentrating on an</v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis of this Schema.</v>

13
00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:27.360
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of being here,</v>

14
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:29.760
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the world of experience,</v>

15
00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:32.550
<v Speaker 1>which is the world that mythology is</v>
<v Speaker 1>attempting to describe,</v>

16
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.480
<v Speaker 1>has these fundamental constituent</v>
<v Speaker 1>elements.</v>

17
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.170
<v Speaker 1>One associated with chaos or nature or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unknown,</v>

18
00:01:40.171 --> 00:01:45.171
<v Speaker 1>one associated with culture or the great</v>
<v Speaker 1>farther or the predictable and another</v>

19
00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:50.691
<v Speaker 1>associated with the architect will son</v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual who's the offspring of</v>

20
00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:54.990
<v Speaker 1>the interplay of these two fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 1>forces.</v>

21
00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.050
<v Speaker 1>Now given that part of the purpose of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this series is to elucidate the causes</v>

22
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.350
<v Speaker 1>of war and motivation for war attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>paid to the dualistic nature of the</v>

23
00:02:05.351 --> 00:02:10.351
<v Speaker 1>individual is of paramount importance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we could say that just as nature has</v>

24
00:02:10.841 --> 00:02:13.570
<v Speaker 1>its terrible side and just this culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>has its terrible side,</v>

25
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.580
<v Speaker 1>so the individual has his or her</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible side and the depth of that</v>

26
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.250
<v Speaker 1>capacity say for atrocity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>vengefulness is just as deep as the</v>

27
00:02:24.251 --> 00:02:27.010
<v Speaker 1>depth of terror that the unknown itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>holds.</v>

28
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.370
<v Speaker 1>I think this is so called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult fact for normal individuals to</v>

30
00:02:34.331 --> 00:02:39.331
<v Speaker 1>grass given that we're highly motivated</v>
<v Speaker 1>to view ourselves as if not precisely</v>

31
00:02:39.401 --> 00:02:41.410
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least as relatively harmless.</v>

32
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.320
<v Speaker 1>But the evidence that as individuals we</v>
<v Speaker 1>are relatively harmless,</v>

33
00:02:44.321 --> 00:02:46.510
<v Speaker 1>is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very thin indeed.</v>

34
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.010
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think it's possible to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the depth</v>

35
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.760
<v Speaker 1>of motivation for atrocity and social</v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict without coming to terms with</v>

36
00:02:57.761 --> 00:03:00.310
<v Speaker 1>the capacity for evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's characteristic of the individual.</v>

37
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both the story in genesis and the story</v>

38
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:04.790
<v Speaker 1>of the Buddha's enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.670
<v Speaker 1>laid bare in many ways the nature of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of individual eval and also</v>

40
00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:11.710
<v Speaker 1>not only it's structured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's motivation.</v>

41
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:16.711
<v Speaker 1>Why it is that people would turn more or</v>
<v Speaker 1>less voluntarily away from the good and</v>

42
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 1>embrace what can only be described as</v>
<v Speaker 1>its polar opposite.</v>

43
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.520
<v Speaker 1>So in addition to making reference to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this structural Schema,</v>

44
00:03:27.221 --> 00:03:29.740
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're also going to be discussing,</v>

45
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.470
<v Speaker 1>it's the typical mode of interaction of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these elements of experience.</v>

46
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.180
<v Speaker 1>You may note for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this diagram with which you're now</v>

47
00:03:41.181 --> 00:03:44.180
<v Speaker 1>very familiar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the notion of order chaos and</v>

48
00:03:44.181 --> 00:03:48.440
<v Speaker 1>reestablishment of order also parallels</v>
<v Speaker 1>the structure of the story in Genesis,</v>

49
00:03:48.441 --> 00:03:51.740
<v Speaker 1>the creation myth where human beings are</v>
<v Speaker 1>created first and existed.</v>

50
00:03:51.741 --> 00:03:54.560
<v Speaker 1>A paradise will state that that paradise</v>
<v Speaker 1>is disrupted.</v>

51
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.580
<v Speaker 1>That as the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of some,</v>

52
00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.730
<v Speaker 1>some uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>event,</v>

53
00:03:58.731 --> 00:04:00.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually cosmic significance,</v>

54
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.970
<v Speaker 1>that as a consequence of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>disruption,</v>

55
00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:07.971
<v Speaker 1>people are destined to live a profane</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence in constant wait for the next</v>

56
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.720
<v Speaker 1>state of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of order.</v>

57
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.070
<v Speaker 1>So just as this is a fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetipal structure,</v>

58
00:04:22.071 --> 00:04:24.530
<v Speaker 1>so that fundamental architectural</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure is,</v>

59
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.740
<v Speaker 1>constitutes the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the basic grammar for the story in</v>

60
00:04:27.741 --> 00:04:29.780
<v Speaker 1>genesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what we're going to do to begin with</v>

61
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.080
<v Speaker 1>is to do describe precisely how this</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of paradise descent and the search</v>

62
00:04:36.721 --> 00:04:41.070
<v Speaker 1>for paradise is illustrated symbolically</v>
<v Speaker 1>agenesis and exactly what those symbolic</v>

63
00:04:41.071 --> 00:04:44.130
<v Speaker 1>representations mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea here being that the reason that</v>

64
00:04:44.131 --> 00:04:47.510
<v Speaker 1>the authors of Genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the multiple authors of Genesis six</v>

65
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.990
<v Speaker 1>extending over thousands and thousands</v>
<v Speaker 1>of years chose those symbols is not</v>

66
00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:55.650
<v Speaker 1>because they were laboring to be obscure</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not because they were establishing a</v>

67
00:04:55.651 --> 00:04:59.490
<v Speaker 1>pre empirical representation of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of,</v>

68
00:04:59.491 --> 00:05:01.590
<v Speaker 1>cause I seem to scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation,</v>

69
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.860
<v Speaker 1>but because these symbols have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>elusive or metaphorical richness than</v>

70
00:05:06.961 --> 00:05:10.050
<v Speaker 1>enables a story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although short to be characterized by an</v>

71
00:05:10.051 --> 00:05:12.330
<v Speaker 1>almost infinite depth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the reason.</v>

72
00:05:12.331 --> 00:05:16.050
<v Speaker 1>The other part of the reason is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say something profound,</v>

73
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.520
<v Speaker 1>you say it using the language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chorus language that you have access</v>

74
00:05:20.521 --> 00:05:20.730
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

75
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.700
<v Speaker 1>And if the story is almost unalterably</v>
<v Speaker 1>profound,</v>

76
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.940
<v Speaker 1>then the images in which is in shrouded</v>
<v Speaker 1>are almost in comprehensively complex.</v>

77
00:05:30.281 --> 00:05:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Then it has to be that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if the target of the</v>

78
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:39.250
<v Speaker 1>investigation is reality itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something so complex that we cannot</v>

79
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.730
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize it fully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the language that we use to</v>

80
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.170
<v Speaker 1>represent that reality has to stretch us</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the limits of our ability to</v>

81
00:05:47.171 --> 00:05:49.460
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it is the case that historian</v>

82
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.920
<v Speaker 1>genesis say as much as the story of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddha's enlightenment constitutes an</v>

83
00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:58.850
<v Speaker 1>artistic endeavor on the part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>human race to portray the nature of</v>

84
00:05:58.851 --> 00:06:02.690
<v Speaker 1>human reality and to explain that</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral and philosophical</v>

85
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:06.410
<v Speaker 1>consequences of that reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that being a tall order,</v>

86
00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:11.411
<v Speaker 1>perhaps we should forgive the multiple</v>
<v Speaker 1>authors for only being able to manage it</v>

87
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:16.190
<v Speaker 1>in a way that's essentially images stick</v>
<v Speaker 1>and dramatic rather than explicit,</v>

88
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.290
<v Speaker 1>logical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical,</v>

89
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:19.460
<v Speaker 1>and fully developed.</v>

90
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.590
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing I'd like to point out</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you is to,</v>

91
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:28.790
<v Speaker 1>is a statement made by Garcia Eliod,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is one of the most</v>

92
00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:33.350
<v Speaker 1>enlightening things I ever read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the first thing that Ellia does is</v>

93
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.410
<v Speaker 1>describe the universality of flood</v>
<v Speaker 1>mythology,</v>

94
00:06:36.411 --> 00:06:40.340
<v Speaker 1>but then he puts a twist on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea behind flooding mythology is</v>

95
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:45.341
<v Speaker 1>something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If societies deviate from an emergent,</v>

96
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.090
<v Speaker 1>unnecessarily emergent kind of morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kind of reality that takes the</v>

97
00:06:50.091 --> 00:06:53.090
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint of all the inhabitants of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>given society into account.</v>

98
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.300
<v Speaker 1>If it's society deviates from that</v>
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint sufficiently,</v>

99
00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.350
<v Speaker 1>it dunes itself to annihilation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That annihilation being represented</v>

100
00:07:00.351 --> 00:07:04.880
<v Speaker 1>mythologies mythologically as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>flooding of the society by that pre</v>

101
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.510
<v Speaker 1>cosmotronic water sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the primordial element or chaos.</v>

102
00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:13.250
<v Speaker 1>So societies that are tyrannical doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves to eradication by chaos,</v>

103
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.890
<v Speaker 1>a simple equation but made more</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated by Ellie.</v>

104
00:07:16.891 --> 00:07:21.140
<v Speaker 1>He's observation that more than one</v>
<v Speaker 1>factor plays a role in the establishment</v>

105
00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:21.974
<v Speaker 1>of a tyranny.</v>

106
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.250
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the straight degeneration of</v>

107
00:07:25.251 --> 00:07:29.990
<v Speaker 1>cultural presuppositions in that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>establish a state or a game,</v>

108
00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:34.190
<v Speaker 1>which has particular rules because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment is constantly</v>

109
00:07:34.191 --> 00:07:37.850
<v Speaker 1>transforming itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rules by necessity become out of</v>

110
00:07:37.851 --> 00:07:40.010
<v Speaker 1>date.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So merely as a consequence of the</v>

111
00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:43.820
<v Speaker 1>progression of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the presuppositions on which any state</v>

112
00:07:43.821 --> 00:07:47.480
<v Speaker 1>or found them tend to become less and</v>
<v Speaker 1>less relevant to the current</v>

113
00:07:47.481 --> 00:07:48.320
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

114
00:07:48.321 --> 00:07:52.340
<v Speaker 1>so there's this aging and senility</v>
<v Speaker 1>merely as a consequence of thermodynamic</v>

115
00:07:52.341 --> 00:07:54.890
<v Speaker 1>processes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then Eliana also points out that</v>

116
00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:58.760
<v Speaker 1>there's one additional factor which has</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be attributed not to society,</v>

117
00:07:58.761 --> 00:08:00.980
<v Speaker 1>but to the individuals that make up that</v>
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>

118
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:05.870
<v Speaker 1>which is that the strictures and rules</v>
<v Speaker 1>on which society is founded,</v>

119
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Ken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be constantly and carefully updated when</v>

120
00:08:09.981 --> 00:08:12.680
<v Speaker 1>necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if all the individuals that make up dot</v>

121
00:08:12.681 --> 00:08:17.360
<v Speaker 1>society are perfectly willing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>confront exemplars of emergent chaos in</v>

122
00:08:17.361 --> 00:08:18.194
<v Speaker 1>their own lives.</v>

123
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:21.860
<v Speaker 1>When those exemplars and merge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that it's perfectly</v>

124
00:08:21.861 --> 00:08:25.130
<v Speaker 1>reasonable to be guided in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality by the structures of your</v>

125
00:08:25.131 --> 00:08:27.290
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you face something unknown that</v>

126
00:08:27.291 --> 00:08:31.130
<v Speaker 1>those rules cannot handle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a moral necessity and obligation on</v>

127
00:08:31.131 --> 00:08:35.540
<v Speaker 1>your part to face that emergent anomaly</v>
<v Speaker 1>forthrightly to souls,</v>

128
00:08:35.541 --> 00:08:38.240
<v Speaker 1>it if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then to communicate the consequences</v>

129
00:08:38.241 --> 00:08:41.090
<v Speaker 1>of your solution to the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>members of your society.</v>

130
00:08:41.091 --> 00:08:44.120
<v Speaker 1>Now with Elliot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it points out is that the individual</v>

131
00:08:44.121 --> 00:08:47.720
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who removes him or herself from the</v>

132
00:08:47.721 --> 00:08:52.610
<v Speaker 1>responsibility of confronting their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>and normally speeds the process by which</v>

133
00:08:52.611 --> 00:08:55.830
<v Speaker 1>the state decays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the decay of the state and the</v>

134
00:08:55.831 --> 00:09:00.831
<v Speaker 1>possibility for the emergence of chaos</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an interaction between the tendency</v>

135
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:06.051
<v Speaker 1>of the state to a archaism and senility</v>
<v Speaker 1>merely as a consequence of change and</v>

136
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.480
<v Speaker 1>the voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the voluntary unwillingness of the</v>

137
00:09:09.481 --> 00:09:13.290
<v Speaker 1>citizens that comprise that state to</v>
<v Speaker 1>face the unknown courageously when it</v>

138
00:09:13.291 --> 00:09:14.040
<v Speaker 1>confronts them.</v>

139
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.890
<v Speaker 1>So Elliot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says the Deluge myth is almost</v>

140
00:09:16.891 --> 00:09:20.850
<v Speaker 1>university disseminated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is documented in all the continents,</v>

141
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:24.000
<v Speaker 1>although very rarely in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably because of the relative</v>

142
00:09:24.001 --> 00:09:26.730
<v Speaker 1>shortage of water and on various</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural levels.</v>

143
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.300
<v Speaker 1>A certain number of variates seem to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the result of dissemination,</v>

144
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:32.640
<v Speaker 1>first from Mesopotamia and then from</v>
<v Speaker 1>India.</v>

145
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:37.890
<v Speaker 1>It is equally possible that one or</v>
<v Speaker 1>several dilute catastrophes gave rise to</v>

146
00:09:37.891 --> 00:09:41.130
<v Speaker 1>fabulous narratives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it would be risky to explain.</v>

147
00:09:41.131 --> 00:09:44.940
<v Speaker 1>So widespread of myth by phenomena of</v>
<v Speaker 1>which no geological traces have been</v>

148
00:09:44.941 --> 00:09:47.340
<v Speaker 1>found.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The majority of the flood myths seem in</v>

149
00:09:47.341 --> 00:09:49.410
<v Speaker 1>some sense to form part of the cosmic</v>
<v Speaker 1>rhythm.</v>

150
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:53.550
<v Speaker 1>The old world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people by a fallen humanity is submerged</v>

151
00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:57.420
<v Speaker 1>under the water and then sometime later</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new world emerges from the aquatic</v>

152
00:09:57.421 --> 00:10:00.540
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a large number of variants,</v>

153
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:04.290
<v Speaker 1>the flood is the result of the sins or</v>
<v Speaker 1>ritual faults of human beings.</v>

154
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it results simply from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wish of a divine being to put an end to</v>

155
00:10:08.371 --> 00:10:12.030
<v Speaker 1>mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chief causes light once therefore in</v>

156
00:10:12.031 --> 00:10:16.260
<v Speaker 1>the sins of men and the decrepitude of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world by the mere fact that it</v>

157
00:10:16.261 --> 00:10:19.620
<v Speaker 1>exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is that it lives in producers.</v>

158
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.520
<v Speaker 1>The cosmos gradually deteriorates and</v>
<v Speaker 1>ends up falling into decay.</v>

159
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:25.980
<v Speaker 1>This is the reason why it has to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>recreated.</v>

160
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.310
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flood realizes on a macrocosmic</v>

161
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.280
<v Speaker 1>scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is symbolically effected during the</v>

162
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.900
<v Speaker 1>New Year Festival,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the world,</v>

163
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:38.060
<v Speaker 1>and the end of a sinful humanity in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to make a new creation possible.</v>

164
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.200
<v Speaker 1>So then the question might arise</v>
<v Speaker 1>logically enough.</v>

165
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.520
<v Speaker 1>What is it that would motivate an</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual to work to avoid a normally</v>

166
00:10:50.521 --> 00:10:55.521
<v Speaker 1>when it emerges in his or her own life</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to risk and eventual flood even more</v>

167
00:10:55.741 --> 00:10:58.140
<v Speaker 1>profoundly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would motivate an individual</v>

168
00:10:58.141 --> 00:11:02.490
<v Speaker 1>perhaps to work for the antithesis of</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to work,</v>

169
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.780
<v Speaker 1>to promote the emergence of chaos?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since we know that people are relatively</v>

170
00:11:06.781 --> 00:11:11.781
<v Speaker 1>ambivalent in their moral stance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it possible that we can create a,</v>

171
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:17.240
<v Speaker 1>a compelling motivational story for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>desire of the individual as such,</v>

172
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:22.530
<v Speaker 1>to work against the emergence of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>good rather than for it.</v>

173
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:26.940
<v Speaker 1>So let's take a look at what genesis</v>
<v Speaker 1>says about the creation of experience.</v>

174
00:11:26.941 --> 00:11:29.670
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember we're taking a phenomenological</v>

175
00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.150
<v Speaker 1>stance on this story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that this story is not</v>

176
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:38.270
<v Speaker 1>an objective retelling of I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>materialistic emergence.</v>

177
00:11:38.341 --> 00:11:41.610
<v Speaker 1>It's something more specifically</v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatic.</v>

178
00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:44.340
<v Speaker 1>It describes the nature of human</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

179
00:11:44.341 --> 00:11:45.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The nature of conscious human</v>

180
00:11:45.991 --> 00:11:49.470
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact the creation story in</v>

181
00:11:49.471 --> 00:11:52.920
<v Speaker 1>genesis lays explicit stress on</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual consciousness,</v>

182
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:56.620
<v Speaker 1>literally as a precondition for being</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

183
00:11:56.621 --> 00:12:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Which is to say that underlying the</v>
<v Speaker 1>story of genesis is the notion that</v>

184
00:12:00.251 --> 00:12:05.251
<v Speaker 1>without whatever consciousness is there</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be no segregated entities and</v>

185
00:12:05.621 --> 00:12:09.070
<v Speaker 1>therefore no being so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one manner in which genesis</v>

186
00:12:09.071 --> 00:12:12.700
<v Speaker 1>attempts to put human beings at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>center of the cosmos,</v>

187
00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:16.540
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the idea that the world</v>

188
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:21.340
<v Speaker 1>independently of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that world is absolutely needs</v>

189
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:25.420
<v Speaker 1>to be reflected by consciousness in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to exist in any sense that</v>

190
00:12:25.421 --> 00:12:30.421
<v Speaker 1>existence could reasonably be defined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First chapter in the beginning,</v>

191
00:12:30.731 --> 00:12:35.530
<v Speaker 1>God created the heaven and the earth and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth was without form and void and</v>

192
00:12:35.531 --> 00:12:39.520
<v Speaker 1>darkness was on the face of the deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the idea that the earth was without</v>

193
00:12:39.521 --> 00:12:44.020
<v Speaker 1>form and void takes us back to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamian creation myth and Marduk</v>

194
00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:45.453
<v Speaker 1>and tie mat.</v>

195
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.310
<v Speaker 1>Because the word for void,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Hebrew word for void,</v>

196
00:12:48.311 --> 00:12:52.360
<v Speaker 1>his tail and Tam is a word derived from</v>
<v Speaker 1>ty Matt.</v>

197
00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:56.350
<v Speaker 1>And the void,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chaos that constitutes the unformed</v>

198
00:12:56.351 --> 00:13:01.351
<v Speaker 1>condition of the cosmos prior to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>elaboration of being is assimilated to</v>

199
00:13:02.321 --> 00:13:05.500
<v Speaker 1>the same category as tire mat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is this terrible,</v>

200
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:10.680
<v Speaker 1>unformed and frightening a priori</v>
<v Speaker 1>condition that has to be courageously</v>

201
00:13:10.841 --> 00:13:13.510
<v Speaker 1>confronted in order to manifest itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>as being.</v>

202
00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:17.050
<v Speaker 1>And the earth was without form and void</v>
<v Speaker 1>and darkness was on the face of the</v>

203
00:13:17.051 --> 00:13:19.630
<v Speaker 1>deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you see another,</v>

204
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:23.230
<v Speaker 1>another interplay of opposites here</v>
<v Speaker 1>between matter and water,</v>

205
00:13:23.231 --> 00:13:25.270
<v Speaker 1>the primordial elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>

206
00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:28.780
<v Speaker 1>it's heaven and earth and then it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth and water and,</v>

207
00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:33.100
<v Speaker 1>and the height and the deep and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit of God moved upon the face of the</v>

208
00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:36.550
<v Speaker 1>waters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So another opposite representation</v>

209
00:13:36.551 --> 00:13:40.780
<v Speaker 1>between spirit and whatever it is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pre cosmotronic water or chaos</v>

210
00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:42.040
<v Speaker 1>constitutes.</v>

211
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.610
<v Speaker 1>And God said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let there be light and there was light</v>

212
00:13:45.611 --> 00:13:48.820
<v Speaker 1>and God saw the light that it was good</v>
<v Speaker 1>and God divided the light from the</v>

213
00:13:48.821 --> 00:13:51.820
<v Speaker 1>darkness and then a prototypical</v>
<v Speaker 1>division between light,</v>

214
00:13:51.821 --> 00:13:56.290
<v Speaker 1>which is associated with illumination</v>
<v Speaker 1>and enlightenment and consciousness</v>

215
00:13:56.291 --> 00:14:01.291
<v Speaker 1>because we're conscious during the day</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the sun and life that emerges nested</v>

216
00:14:02.051 --> 00:14:05.170
<v Speaker 1>inside this initial opening lines of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sentence,</v>

217
00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:09.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>northrop frye notes that there's</v>

218
00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:14.170
<v Speaker 1>tremendous emphasis on the notion of s a</v>
<v Speaker 1>repetitive cycling of days and nights in</v>

219
00:14:14.321 --> 00:14:18.400
<v Speaker 1>the opening sentences of genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though from a formal perspective,</v>

220
00:14:18.401 --> 00:14:23.380
<v Speaker 1>this emphasis is paradoxical because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>notion of the day merges before the</v>

221
00:14:23.381 --> 00:14:27.610
<v Speaker 1>creation of the sun and fry's point is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that this is some careless gesture</v>

222
00:14:27.611 --> 00:14:30.070
<v Speaker 1>on the part of the people who authored</v>
<v Speaker 1>genesis,</v>

223
00:14:30.071 --> 00:14:33.940
<v Speaker 1>but more that it's an attempt to</v>
<v Speaker 1>emphasize the idea of a cyclical</v>

224
00:14:33.941 --> 00:14:38.110
<v Speaker 1>relationship between consciousness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>light and darkness and chaos.</v>

225
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.440
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

226
00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:43.060
<v Speaker 1>and to highlight the idea that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>cyclical relationship is somehow</v>

227
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:48.600
<v Speaker 1>absolutely vital to being itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So genesis one five says,</v>

228
00:14:49.211 --> 00:14:53.000
<v Speaker 1>and God called the light day and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>darkness he called night and the evening</v>

229
00:14:53.001 --> 00:14:55.100
<v Speaker 1>in the morning where the first day fry's</v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

230
00:14:55.101 --> 00:14:59.000
<v Speaker 1>the central metaphor underlying</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning is not really birth at all.</v>

231
00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:01.370
<v Speaker 1>It has rather the moment of waking from</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>

232
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:06.380
<v Speaker 1>When one world disappears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a world of virtuality and potential and</v>

233
00:15:06.381 --> 00:15:10.580
<v Speaker 1>another comes into actual beating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is still contained within a cycle.</v>

234
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.890
<v Speaker 1>We know that at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we shall return to the world of sleep</v>

235
00:15:13.891 --> 00:15:16.100
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a notion that has a</v>

236
00:15:16.101 --> 00:15:20.000
<v Speaker 1>metaphorical resonance because there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sleep that punctuates periods of</v>

237
00:15:20.001 --> 00:15:22.370
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the great sleep at the</v>

238
00:15:22.371 --> 00:15:25.190
<v Speaker 1>end end of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is characterized by the complete</v>

239
00:15:25.191 --> 00:15:29.120
<v Speaker 1>cessation of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We knew that at the end of the day we</v>

240
00:15:29.121 --> 00:15:32.360
<v Speaker 1>shall return to the world of sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the meantime there's a sense of</v>

241
00:15:32.361 --> 00:15:37.130
<v Speaker 1>self transcendence of a consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting up from an unreal into a real or</v>

242
00:15:37.131 --> 00:15:41.090
<v Speaker 1>at least more real world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a sense of awakening into a greater</v>

243
00:15:41.091 --> 00:15:44.870
<v Speaker 1>degree of reality is expressed by</v>
<v Speaker 1>hereclitis as a passing from a world</v>

244
00:15:44.871 --> 00:15:49.610
<v Speaker 1>where everyone has his own logos into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>world where there's a carmen logos.</v>

245
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:54.470
<v Speaker 1>The experience that we all share.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Genesis presents the creation as a</v>

246
00:15:54.471 --> 00:15:58.340
<v Speaker 1>sudden coming into being of a world</v>
<v Speaker 1>through articulate speech,</v>

247
00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:03.350
<v Speaker 1>which is another aspect of logos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Logos incorporates the idea of creative</v>

248
00:16:03.351 --> 00:16:07.670
<v Speaker 1>exploration and then the formulation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the consequences of that exploration and</v>

249
00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.370
<v Speaker 1>verbally communicable categories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

250
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:13.430
<v Speaker 1>which give our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give our aspects of our being there</v>

251
00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:18.431
<v Speaker 1>defined boundaries and parameters and</v>
<v Speaker 1>enable us to establish a shared mode of</v>

252
00:16:18.441 --> 00:16:21.950
<v Speaker 1>social being</v>
<v Speaker 1>through articulate speech,</v>

253
00:16:21.951 --> 00:16:24.170
<v Speaker 1>conscious perception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>light and stability.</v>

254
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.940
<v Speaker 1>Something like this metaphor of</v>
<v Speaker 1>awakening.</v>

255
00:16:25.941 --> 00:16:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the real reason for the emphasis</v>
<v Speaker 1>on days and such recurring phrases and</v>

256
00:16:29.901 --> 00:16:31.760
<v Speaker 1>the evening in the morning where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first day,</v>

257
00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.810
<v Speaker 1>even before the day is we know it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>established with the creating of the</v>

258
00:16:35.811 --> 00:16:36.644
<v Speaker 1>sun.</v>

259
00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:46.850
<v Speaker 1>The most fundamental pair of conflicting</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sick likely interacting pairs of</v>

260
00:16:47.551 --> 00:16:50.710
<v Speaker 1>opposites that is portrayed in genesis</v>
<v Speaker 1>is essentially the,</v>

261
00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:55.980
<v Speaker 1>the pairing of chaos versus order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Generative chaos versus generative order</v>

262
00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:01.730
<v Speaker 1>and a poem expresses this idea extremely</v>
<v Speaker 1>well and very powerfully,</v>

263
00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:05.310
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to read it to sacred night</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweeps.</v>

264
00:17:05.311 --> 00:17:10.110
<v Speaker 1>Having word she takes the glad the wind</v>
<v Speaker 1>some day and folding it rolls up.</v>

265
00:17:10.111 --> 00:17:14.370
<v Speaker 1>It's gold carpet that had been spread</v>
<v Speaker 1>over an abysmal pit,</v>

266
00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:17.670
<v Speaker 1>gone vision like as the external world</v>
<v Speaker 1>and man,</v>

267
00:17:17.671 --> 00:17:22.170
<v Speaker 1>a homeless orphan has to face an author</v>
<v Speaker 1>helplessness naked alone.</v>

268
00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:26.490
<v Speaker 1>The blackness of immeasurable space upon</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

269
00:17:26.491 --> 00:17:29.040
<v Speaker 1>He has to lean with mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>abolished,</v>

270
00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.040
<v Speaker 1>thought and fathered in the dim depths</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his soul.</v>

271
00:17:32.041 --> 00:17:37.041
<v Speaker 1>He sinks for nothing comes from outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>to support or limit him all life and</v>

272
00:17:37.231 --> 00:17:38.250
<v Speaker 1>brightness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Semen,</v>

273
00:17:38.251 --> 00:17:41.730
<v Speaker 1>ancient dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While in the substance of the night</v>

274
00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:43.530
<v Speaker 1>unraveled alien.</v>

275
00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:47.310
<v Speaker 1>He now perceives a fateful something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is his by right?</v>

276
00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely brilliant poetic statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think laying out very nicely,</v>

277
00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:57.750
<v Speaker 1>very richly that the fundamental nature</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the existential paradox that</v>

278
00:17:57.751 --> 00:18:02.751
<v Speaker 1>constitutes human life pointing to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very profound sense of futility in</v>

279
00:18:03.451 --> 00:18:06.120
<v Speaker 1>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then beyond that to the notion that</v>

280
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:10.260
<v Speaker 1>in the depths of the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the depths of the darkness and in the</v>

281
00:18:10.261 --> 00:18:13.740
<v Speaker 1>depths of all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fundamentally unfakeable,</v>

282
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:18.030
<v Speaker 1>there are still lurks something that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be discovered given sufficient courage,</v>

283
00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:25.610
<v Speaker 1>another fundamental division portrayed</v>
<v Speaker 1>indirectly in genesis the word versus</v>

284
00:18:27.091 --> 00:18:29.910
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you have in genesis is an</v>

285
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:34.650
<v Speaker 1>absolutely stellar idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think perhaps the most fundamental</v>

286
00:18:34.651 --> 00:18:39.630
<v Speaker 1>contribution of archaic Jewish thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Western and world civilization,</v>

287
00:18:39.631 --> 00:18:44.631
<v Speaker 1>which is that although it is easier in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some ways to consider the actual matrix</v>

288
00:18:44.821 --> 00:18:48.420
<v Speaker 1>of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their material substrate as the strata</v>

289
00:18:48.421 --> 00:18:52.260
<v Speaker 1>from which they emerge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is equally reasonable and perhaps</v>

290
00:18:52.261 --> 00:18:57.261
<v Speaker 1>more pragmatically useful to know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>things only exist because of the</v>

291
00:18:57.421 --> 00:19:00.750
<v Speaker 1>interaction between the logos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word that characterizes</v>

292
00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.240
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and whatever this matrix</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

293
00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:08.240
<v Speaker 1>So in Jewish thought and then Christian</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought and of course in in thoughts of</v>

294
00:19:08.311 --> 00:19:09.750
<v Speaker 1>that sort of echoed throughout the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

295
00:19:09.751 --> 00:19:14.400
<v Speaker 1>There's the idea that consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with the transcendent</v>

296
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:18.060
<v Speaker 1>directly associated with the daddy is</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually the thing that in the</v>

297
00:19:18.061 --> 00:19:23.061
<v Speaker 1>interaction with this matrix give re</v>
<v Speaker 1>gives rise to being genesis plays a</v>

298
00:19:24.031 --> 00:19:28.470
<v Speaker 1>stress places stress on this notion of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the internal logos,</v>

299
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.680
<v Speaker 1>the individual consciousness and to very</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex ways.</v>

300
00:19:31.681 --> 00:19:34.380
<v Speaker 1>It's first stance that it's the word of</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

301
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:39.440
<v Speaker 1>the logos of God that gives or that</v>
<v Speaker 1>gives ordered to chaos and makes being</v>

302
00:19:40.101 --> 00:19:43.260
<v Speaker 1>emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then even more particularly it's</v>

303
00:19:43.261 --> 00:19:47.430
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the self conscious logos of</v>

304
00:19:47.431 --> 00:19:50.850
<v Speaker 1>individual humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their capacity not just to see the world</v>

305
00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:55.560
<v Speaker 1>as an object but also to see themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an object that gives the world that</v>

306
00:19:55.561 --> 00:19:58.320
<v Speaker 1>particular value slump that it has for</v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

307
00:19:58.321 --> 00:20:03.321
<v Speaker 1>Which is to say that not only are we in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a world where the subject and the object</v>

308
00:20:03.601 --> 00:20:05.490
<v Speaker 1>are separated and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

309
00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:09.180
<v Speaker 1>and therefore experience and suffer the</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of that separation.</v>

310
00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:13.410
<v Speaker 1>But even more particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are the only creatures who are so</v>

311
00:20:13.411 --> 00:20:16.980
<v Speaker 1>conscious that we can observe our self</v>
<v Speaker 1>as objects.</v>

312
00:20:16.981 --> 00:20:20.910
<v Speaker 1>And the consequence of that is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we've extended our consciousness</v>

313
00:20:20.911 --> 00:20:23.940
<v Speaker 1>to ourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're capable of conceptualizing things</v>

314
00:20:23.941 --> 00:20:25.890
<v Speaker 1>that other creatures cannot</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize,</v>

315
00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:30.390
<v Speaker 1>such as the infinite possibility that</v>
<v Speaker 1>lays manifested in the unknown,</v>

316
00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:35.540
<v Speaker 1>but also the fact that as individuals</v>
<v Speaker 1>were subject to our finite limitations,</v>

317
00:20:37.231 --> 00:20:39.390
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can become diseased,</v>

318
00:20:39.391 --> 00:20:42.510
<v Speaker 1>that we can become mentally ill on that</v>
<v Speaker 1>finally will die.</v>

319
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:47.530
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea here is that something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the extension of logos to the</v>

320
00:20:47.531 --> 00:20:52.531
<v Speaker 1>object to the subject has made human</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence finally problematic.</v>

321
00:20:55.660 --> 00:21:00.400
<v Speaker 1>And Genesis refers to this as</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially the heritable sin of Adam</v>

322
00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:05.470
<v Speaker 1>because we're aware of our own</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability as a genetic consequence</v>

323
00:21:05.471 --> 00:21:09.040
<v Speaker 1>merely of being human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a transformation in the nature</v>

324
00:21:09.041 --> 00:21:13.030
<v Speaker 1>of experience that has essentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmic significance.</v>

325
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Lout sue and the Dao de Jing makes a</v>
<v Speaker 1>comment on the formless chaos that</v>

326
00:21:22.901 --> 00:21:26.950
<v Speaker 1>constitutes the matrix of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the origin of things in the following</v>

327
00:21:26.951 --> 00:21:30.370
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says there was something formless yet</v>

328
00:21:30.371 --> 00:21:34.180
<v Speaker 1>to complete that existed before heaven</v>
<v Speaker 1>and earth without sound,</v>

329
00:21:34.181 --> 00:21:37.930
<v Speaker 1>without substance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the void or the chaos dependent</v>

330
00:21:37.931 --> 00:21:39.610
<v Speaker 1>on nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unchanging,</v>

331
00:21:39.611 --> 00:21:43.390
<v Speaker 1>all pervading unfailing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we think of it as the mother of all</v>

332
00:21:43.391 --> 00:21:47.830
<v Speaker 1>things under having the idea here being</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whatever experience is in the</v>

333
00:21:47.831 --> 00:21:51.910
<v Speaker 1>absence of a delimited human</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is something that's</v>

334
00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:56.410
<v Speaker 1>outside the boundaries of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because time is a temporary is a human</v>

335
00:21:56.411 --> 00:22:00.610
<v Speaker 1>attribute and it's outside the</v>
<v Speaker 1>boundaries of spatial limitation because</v>

336
00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:05.790
<v Speaker 1>only human beings with their delimited</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fixed size can attribute spatial</v>

337
00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:11.730
<v Speaker 1>aspects to being itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whatever it is is that exists without</v>

338
00:22:12.251 --> 00:22:14.920
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so comprehensive and so complete</v>

339
00:22:14.921 --> 00:22:19.810
<v Speaker 1>and transcends temporal dimensions to</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a great degree that it can't be</v>

340
00:22:19.811 --> 00:22:24.550
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized as being at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something that transcends being to</v>

341
00:22:24.551 --> 00:22:28.630
<v Speaker 1>such a degree that it's not even</v>
<v Speaker 1>nameable but still exists as the mother</v>

342
00:22:28.631 --> 00:22:30.430
<v Speaker 1>of all things under heaven.</v>

343
00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:37.480
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>genesis formerly associates the human</v>

344
00:22:37.481 --> 00:22:42.040
<v Speaker 1>being with logos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a determinitive move in</v>

345
00:22:42.041 --> 00:22:45.340
<v Speaker 1>human history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as the Mesopotamians first</v>

346
00:22:45.341 --> 00:22:50.110
<v Speaker 1>hypothesized that their emperor was</v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to Marduk the force that</v>

347
00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:53.380
<v Speaker 1>confronted timeout and carved her into</v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces and made the world.</v>

348
00:22:53.381 --> 00:22:58.360
<v Speaker 1>And just as the Egyptians conceptualize</v>
<v Speaker 1>their pharaoh as the intermingling</v>

349
00:22:58.361 --> 00:23:01.690
<v Speaker 1>between ocirus stability of the state</v>
<v Speaker 1>and horace,</v>

350
00:23:01.691 --> 00:23:06.190
<v Speaker 1>the exploratory hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then disseminated that identity down</v>

351
00:23:06.191 --> 00:23:10.960
<v Speaker 1>the aristocratic levels closer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>closer to the individual individual.</v>

352
00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.740
<v Speaker 1>So the ancient Hebrews said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and God said,</v>

353
00:23:14.741 --> 00:23:18.490
<v Speaker 1>let us make man in our image after our</v>
<v Speaker 1>likeness.</v>

354
00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Now it could be said that the logical</v>
<v Speaker 1>derivation of that statement is that God</v>

355
00:23:24.641 --> 00:23:26.680
<v Speaker 1>looks like human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or conversely,</v>

356
00:23:26.681 --> 00:23:29.860
<v Speaker 1>that God is an old man with a beard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it means something.</v>

357
00:23:29.861 --> 00:23:32.170
<v Speaker 1>I think that's more sophisticated than</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

358
00:23:32.171 --> 00:23:37.171
<v Speaker 1>which is that the central aspect that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with this transcendent daddy,</v>

359
00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:40.570
<v Speaker 1>the logos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the thing that gives rise to</v>

360
00:23:40.571 --> 00:23:43.480
<v Speaker 1>order as a consequence of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>confrontation with chaos,</v>

361
00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:47.210
<v Speaker 1>is also the thing that centrally</v>
<v Speaker 1>characterizes human consciousness.</v>

362
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:50.690
<v Speaker 1>And so with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this transcendent notion that</v>

363
00:23:50.691 --> 00:23:55.130
<v Speaker 1>inside each human being is a spark of</v>
<v Speaker 1>genuine divinity,</v>

364
00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.640
<v Speaker 1>and it's the manifestation of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>divinity in human,</v>

365
00:23:58.641 --> 00:24:03.170
<v Speaker 1>temporal and spatial parameters that</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally keeps the cosmos generating.</v>

366
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.800
<v Speaker 1>So God created man in his own image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the image of God created he,</v>

367
00:24:12.801 --> 00:24:16.670
<v Speaker 1>him male and female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>created he them and let them have</v>

368
00:24:16.671 --> 00:24:20.060
<v Speaker 1>dominion over the fish of the sea and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fall of the air and over the cattle</v>

369
00:24:20.061 --> 00:24:23.600
<v Speaker 1>and over all the earth and over every</v>
<v Speaker 1>creeping thing that creepeth upon the</v>

370
00:24:23.601 --> 00:24:26.960
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the fundamentalist Christians read</v>

371
00:24:26.961 --> 00:24:28.550
<v Speaker 1>this as an injunction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

372
00:24:28.551 --> 00:24:32.480
<v Speaker 1>This is what human being should do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominate all other living things,</v>

373
00:24:32.481 --> 00:24:36.110
<v Speaker 1>but it's more like a description,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that the consequence of the</v>

374
00:24:36.111 --> 00:24:40.730
<v Speaker 1>embeddedness of this spark of divinity</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the individual is precisely what gave</v>

375
00:24:40.731 --> 00:24:43.310
<v Speaker 1>rise to the human ability to dominate</v>
<v Speaker 1>the planet.</v>

376
00:24:43.311 --> 00:24:45.440
<v Speaker 1>We just an ability that at least at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

377
00:24:45.441 --> 00:24:49.580
<v Speaker 1>seems fundamentally unparalleled with no</v>
<v Speaker 1>limit in sight.</v>

378
00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:54.110
<v Speaker 1>So it's not an injunction so much as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cold hearted description.</v>

379
00:24:55.700 --> 00:25:00.590
<v Speaker 1>There's a very profound idea underlying</v>
<v Speaker 1>the necessity of the creation of the</v>

380
00:25:00.591 --> 00:25:01.820
<v Speaker 1>individual human big.</v>

381
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:05.900
<v Speaker 1>There's a line of Archaic Jewish</v>
<v Speaker 1>speculation that runs something like</v>

382
00:25:05.901 --> 00:25:10.070
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is the creation of a limited subject</v>

383
00:25:10.071 --> 00:25:13.220
<v Speaker 1>necessary?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If God's Omniscience and omnipotent and</v>

384
00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:16.160
<v Speaker 1>omnipresent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would he bother creating anything</v>

385
00:25:16.161 --> 00:25:19.070
<v Speaker 1>outside of himself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the line of speculation runs like</v>

386
00:25:19.071 --> 00:25:22.520
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one thing that a being that is</v>

387
00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:26.660
<v Speaker 1>complete in all regards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even all hypothetical regards,</v>

388
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:31.820
<v Speaker 1>lax by necessity is limitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a consequence of that,</v>

389
00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:36.470
<v Speaker 1>anything that's absolute is not complete</v>
<v Speaker 1>and can't be complete without</v>

390
00:25:36.471 --> 00:25:40.040
<v Speaker 1>limitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's an emergent idea in</v>

391
00:25:40.041 --> 00:25:44.420
<v Speaker 1>genesis and most notions of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>emergence of human consciousness that</v>

392
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:47.830
<v Speaker 1>the absolute needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reflection point of a delimited</v>

393
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.220
<v Speaker 1>being to actually spring into some kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of defined actuality.</v>

394
00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:56.660
<v Speaker 1>So that being itself becomes an an an</v>
<v Speaker 1>interplay between the necessarily</v>

395
00:25:56.661 --> 00:26:01.661
<v Speaker 1>limitations of the finite and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent reality of the absolute.</v>

396
00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:07.240
<v Speaker 1>And so being is something that emerges</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the fact as another ancient</v>

397
00:26:09.201 --> 00:26:14.000
<v Speaker 1>Jewish tradition has it gone in man or</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a sense twins mutually dependent on</v>

398
00:26:14.001 --> 00:26:19.001
<v Speaker 1>one another for their defined being from</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a perspective being has the same</v>

399
00:26:21.531 --> 00:26:22.700
<v Speaker 1>nature as a game.</v>

400
00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:25.040
<v Speaker 1>When you're playing a game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to play by rules,</v>

401
00:26:25.041 --> 00:26:28.790
<v Speaker 1>which means that there are things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do well playing the game with.</v>

402
00:26:28.791 --> 00:26:30.560
<v Speaker 1>There are many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many things you can't do,</v>

403
00:26:30.561 --> 00:26:34.250
<v Speaker 1>and that the game could not exist</v>
<v Speaker 1>without the limitations.</v>

404
00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:38.300
<v Speaker 1>Also predicated on the idea that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>imposition and Nietzsche and idea that</v>

405
00:26:38.301 --> 00:26:42.470
<v Speaker 1>the imposition of limitations on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure actually gives rise to the</v>

406
00:26:42.471 --> 00:26:46.830
<v Speaker 1>possibility diverse new forms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also a very sophisticated way</v>

407
00:26:46.831 --> 00:26:51.660
<v Speaker 1>of conceptualizing the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So from the perspective of Genesis,</v>

408
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:56.550
<v Speaker 1>the individual is the low cow of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiential drama,</v>

409
00:26:56.551 --> 00:27:01.440
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that the individual is</v>
<v Speaker 1>limited is a necessary precondition for</v>

410
00:27:01.441 --> 00:27:02.274
<v Speaker 1>being right.</v>

411
00:27:59.700 --> 00:27:59.770
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
