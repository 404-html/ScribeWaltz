1
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.030
<v Speaker 1>So the last time we met,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about a Greek myth,</v>

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.680
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that correct?</v>

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.790
<v Speaker 1>We talked about horace and Isis and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

4
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:14.723
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to talk to you about this </v>

5
00:00:23.621 --> 00:00:28.290
<v Speaker 1>symbol today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which reminds me.</v>

6
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:30.720
<v Speaker 1>There's another slide that I need to use</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>

7
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.093
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

8
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:38.803
<v Speaker 1>This took me a long time to sort out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks to me like Ms Dot lg uses to </v>

9
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.993
<v Speaker 1>classic myth and the symbols that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with classic myth use two </v>

10
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.853
<v Speaker 1>different symbols to represent the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown and one of them as far as I can </v>

11
00:00:57.501 --> 00:00:59.690
<v Speaker 1>tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>represents the absolute unknown.</v>

12
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.910
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be things that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a complicated conceptual category.</v>

13
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.533
<v Speaker 1>All these are because otherwise they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be articulated and explicit </v>

14
00:01:11.031 --> 00:01:11.864
<v Speaker 1>categories instead of images stick and </v>
<v Speaker 1>artistic categories and so they're </v>

15
00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:17.744
<v Speaker 1>trying to.</v>

16
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.283
<v Speaker 1>The symbols express a very large variety</v>
<v Speaker 1>of things that are difficult to </v>

17
00:01:27.151 --> 00:01:28.860
<v Speaker 1>formulate into an explicit set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

18
00:01:28.861 --> 00:01:31.290
<v Speaker 1>one of the theories that young had about</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbols,</v>

19
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.630
<v Speaker 1>which I really like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's different than the Freudian idea.</v>

20
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.893
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud believed that your mind produced </v>

21
00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:43.191
<v Speaker 1>symbols to represent content that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>repressed.</v>

22
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.310
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it does that from time to time,</v>

23
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.030
<v Speaker 1>but you thought of the symbol in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different way.</v>

24
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:58.440
<v Speaker 1>He thought of it as something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>floated up from the depths so to speak.</v>

25
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.770
<v Speaker 1>I actually think that's the right way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it.</v>

26
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.630
<v Speaker 1>Like a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

27
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 1>we don't really know much about </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

28
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.553
<v Speaker 1>It's proved very elusive to scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>study and we don't really know much </v>

29
00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:15.744
<v Speaker 1>about the process by which the </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of very complex concepts </v>

30
00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:22.410
<v Speaker 1>comes about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we've started to take that apart to</v>

31
00:02:22.411 --> 00:02:24.000
<v Speaker 1>some degree in the class,</v>

32
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:28.723
<v Speaker 1>you're often confronted with things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand and can't control </v>

33
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.313
<v Speaker 1>and it's necessary to categorize those </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have to figure out how to </v>

34
00:02:38.931 --> 00:02:39.764
<v Speaker 1>deal with them and we've already </v>
<v Speaker 1>established the proposition that most </v>

35
00:02:44.121 --> 00:02:48.830
<v Speaker 1>human categories that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are fundamental art associated with</v>

36
00:02:48.831 --> 00:02:49.664
<v Speaker 1>action rather than than representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you could think in some sense that </v>

37
00:02:53.181 --> 00:02:55.130
<v Speaker 1>the action is the representation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

38
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.010
<v Speaker 1>Which which would mean you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

39
00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 1>what's a monster where we could even do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something simpler.</v>

40
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:04.780
<v Speaker 1>We can say what's a chair?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I could say,</v>

41
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:05.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chair,</v>

42
00:03:05.751 --> 00:03:06.584
<v Speaker 1>it could be a beanbag and a chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be a stump and that you might </v>

43
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:10.474
<v Speaker 1>ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

44
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.793
<v Speaker 1>a chair in a beanbag and a stump have </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually nothing in common apart from </v>

45
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:17.770
<v Speaker 1>the fact that they're both made out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

46
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.413
<v Speaker 1>They're very dissimilar entities and yet</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can encapsulate them under the same </v>

47
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:23.824
<v Speaker 1>headache and the reason for that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can sit on and so the </v>

48
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:27.994
<v Speaker 1>categories are actually predicated on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the use and we've talked about the idea </v>

49
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:31.924
<v Speaker 1>that we categorize things as as tools or</v>
<v Speaker 1>or that we categorize them in </v>

50
00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 1>relationship to their</v>

51
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.493
<v Speaker 2>there</v>

52
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.170
<v Speaker 1>implication for action.</v>

53
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:44.653
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

54
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.660
<v Speaker 1>there were mammalian creatures around </v>
<v Speaker 1>between 60 and 220 million years ago.</v>

55
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.070
<v Speaker 1>This is very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

56
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.943
<v Speaker 1>it's long enough for those mammals to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been overlapping with dinosaurs </v>

57
00:03:59.661 --> 00:04:02.390
<v Speaker 1>quite nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

58
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.980
<v Speaker 1>our early ancestors were quite small and</v>
<v Speaker 1>easily preyed upon and then are later.</v>

59
00:04:06.981 --> 00:04:07.814
<v Speaker 1>Ancestors were tree dwelling primates </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they were ground dwelling </v>

60
00:04:11.721 --> 00:04:14.480
<v Speaker 1>primates and now we're city dwelling </v>
<v Speaker 1>primates,</v>

61
00:04:14.481 --> 00:04:18.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was a tremendously long period</v>

62
00:04:18.201 --> 00:04:23.201
<v Speaker 1>where we were preyed on things that came</v>
<v Speaker 1>in from the outside.</v>

63
00:04:24.421 --> 00:04:29.421
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of looking about looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>at it and from this perspective,</v>

64
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.490
<v Speaker 1>a monster is something that's predatory </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that comes out from outside and that</v>

65
00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:37.324
<v Speaker 1>something you don't expect and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabits unexplored territory and </v>

66
00:04:40.701 --> 00:04:44.480
<v Speaker 1>something that you don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all of those things at once</v>

67
00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:46.363
<v Speaker 2>and then</v>

68
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.050
<v Speaker 1>do to the degree that the psyche is </v>
<v Speaker 1>transpersonal,</v>

69
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.220
<v Speaker 1>which means to the degree that your mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>is capable,</v>

70
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.103
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the concepts so that your mind uses to </v>

71
00:05:06.941 --> 00:05:11.941
<v Speaker 1>organize the world are an expression of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a heritable structure.</v>

72
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.123
<v Speaker 2>Then</v>

73
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.233
<v Speaker 1>it's reasonable to propose that you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>an inbuilt representation of something </v>

74
00:05:27.191 --> 00:05:28.024
<v Speaker 1>like the Predator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's more complicated in human </v>

75
00:05:30.431 --> 00:05:31.690
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>

76
00:05:31.691 --> 00:05:33.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there any evidence for that?</v>

77
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Because it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:36.543
<v Speaker 1>Young's ideas of archetypes of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>collective unconscious has never really </v>

79
00:05:40.931 --> 00:05:41.764
<v Speaker 1>been accepted by general psychologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of biological psychologists are </v>

80
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:46.354
<v Speaker 1>interested in it by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're much more familiar with </v>

81
00:05:48.971 --> 00:05:49.804
<v Speaker 1>the idea of built in instinct and action</v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern and instincts and action </v>

82
00:05:53.591 --> 00:05:56.740
<v Speaker 1>patterns that are built in can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably complicated and we do know,</v>

83
00:05:56.741 --> 00:05:57.574
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that rats that are never exposed to a </v>

84
00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:06.311
<v Speaker 1>cat in their life will still panic if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you waft cat older over their domicile.</v>

85
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.013
<v Speaker 1>So rats do not like the smell of cats </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they don't have to learn that for a </v>

86
00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:15.824
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychologists believe that you learn </v>

87
00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:20.294
<v Speaker 1>theory through conditioning and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an idea that there were </v>

88
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.103
<v Speaker 1>prepared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are certain fears were </v>

89
00:06:27.791 --> 00:06:30.040
<v Speaker 1>prepared so you could learn them more </v>
<v Speaker 1>easily.</v>

90
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.730
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I wanted to condition a fear response</v>

91
00:06:33.731 --> 00:06:34.564
<v Speaker 1>to you and I showed you a picture of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>snake and associated with a small </v>

92
00:06:37.451 --> 00:06:41.190
<v Speaker 1>electric shock compared to fy associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a picture,</v>

93
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.930
<v Speaker 1>say of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a daisy or even a pistol,</v>

94
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.793
<v Speaker 1>which is also a dangerous thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you're going to learn to be </v>

95
00:06:47.831 --> 00:06:49.750
<v Speaker 1>conditioned to the snake much faster.</v>

96
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.450
<v Speaker 1>So that's sorta the weak version of </v>
<v Speaker 1>prepared categorization,</v>

97
00:06:54.451 --> 00:06:55.284
<v Speaker 1>but they're stronger versions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>prepared categorization to and I </v>

98
00:06:57.451 --> 00:06:58.284
<v Speaker 1>actually think they're correct and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't see why they wouldn't be the </v>

99
00:07:05.321 --> 00:07:09.760
<v Speaker 1>stronger version is that no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have your,</v>

100
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:10.580
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

101
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.930
<v Speaker 1>your apprehension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're alert,</v>

102
00:07:13.931 --> 00:07:14.980
<v Speaker 1>apprehension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alert,</v>

103
00:07:14.981 --> 00:07:15.814
<v Speaker 1>apprehension that you would devote </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards something like a predatory </v>

104
00:07:17.801 --> 00:07:21.100
<v Speaker 1>reptile is not something that you need </v>
<v Speaker 1>to learn at all.</v>

105
00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.200
<v Speaker 1>You already know how to do it.</v>

106
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:24.563
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

107
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.340
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that that's been proven </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond a shadow of a doubt,</v>

108
00:07:30.341 --> 00:07:31.174
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we do know that chimpanzees react </v>

109
00:07:36.551 --> 00:07:37.384
<v Speaker 1>with fear to a variety of stimuli that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't necessarily come into </v>

110
00:07:43.031 --> 00:07:45.220
<v Speaker 1>contact with during their developmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>periods.</v>

111
00:07:45.221 --> 00:07:46.054
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees don't like bodies of </v>

112
00:07:50.311 --> 00:07:53.690
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees that don't move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you bring on,</v>

113
00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:57.090
<v Speaker 1>and that's the tie is champion to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>group of chimps in a zoo.</v>

114
00:07:57.091 --> 00:07:59.340
<v Speaker 1>Say the chimps are not happy about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

115
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:02.493
<v Speaker 1>They also don't like snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't like even plastic snakes and </v>

116
00:08:04.991 --> 00:08:07.030
<v Speaker 1>they don't like snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if they've never seen a snake.</v>

117
00:08:07.031 --> 00:08:09.910
<v Speaker 1>And if they see a snake when and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>never have,</v>

118
00:08:09.911 --> 00:08:11.500
<v Speaker 1>they'll get the hell away from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>snake,</v>

119
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.633
<v Speaker 1>but then they'll turn around and look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and look at it and look at it and </v>

120
00:08:14.921 --> 00:08:15.754
<v Speaker 1>look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the wild they do something </v>

121
00:08:17.201 --> 00:08:18.250
<v Speaker 1>similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if a,</v>

122
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.293
<v Speaker 1>if a chimp comes across a snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big snake say it has a particular </v>

123
00:08:24.161 --> 00:08:24.911
<v Speaker 1>noise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes,</v>

124
00:08:24.911 --> 00:08:25.744
<v Speaker 1>which is called a snake Ra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess that's a representation of </v>

125
00:08:29.861 --> 00:08:30.694
<v Speaker 1>the noise that the chimp makes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what happens when the chimp makes </v>

126
00:08:32.621 --> 00:08:33.454
<v Speaker 1>that noise is all the other chimps will </v>
<v Speaker 1>come running and they'll look at the </v>

127
00:08:35.411 --> 00:08:37.960
<v Speaker 1>snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're sort of enraptured by the snake,</v>

128
00:08:37.961 --> 00:08:39.520
<v Speaker 1>I think is the right way to think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

129
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:42.490
<v Speaker 1>I think they're in all of the snake to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you the truth.</v>

130
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might take,</v>

131
00:08:44.501 --> 00:08:46.520
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees can't feel all.</v>

132
00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:47.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

133
00:08:47.741 --> 00:08:51.970
<v Speaker 1>don't be so sure you're a modified </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzee and you can feel all and.</v>

134
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.830
<v Speaker 1>But there's more to this story than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

135
00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:55.963
<v Speaker 1>You ever listened to a piece of music </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes the hair on the back of your </v>

136
00:08:57.841 --> 00:09:00.360
<v Speaker 1>neck stand up or a shiver run through </v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

137
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.590
<v Speaker 1>Is that a familiar experience to people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has Anybody not had that experience?</v>

138
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:06.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

139
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:08.490
<v Speaker 1>You're the only person in the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>

140
00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

141
00:09:12.961 --> 00:09:14.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

142
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.900
<v Speaker 1>maybe whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>

143
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:17.993
<v Speaker 1>The shiver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Shiver is a consequence of pillow </v>

144
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:21.083
<v Speaker 1>erection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what that means is that when you </v>

145
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.193
<v Speaker 1>have that feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing the same thing that a cat </v>

146
00:09:28.111 --> 00:09:32.730
<v Speaker 1>does when it puffs out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason that the cat does that is</v>

147
00:09:32.731 --> 00:09:33.564
<v Speaker 1>to look big and the reason it wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look big is because it sees something </v>

148
00:09:36.391 --> 00:09:37.224
<v Speaker 1>that is inspiring and that's partly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an admixture mixture of terror </v>

149
00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:44.100
<v Speaker 1>around and</v>

150
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.650
<v Speaker 1>fascination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

151
00:09:47.651 --> 00:09:48.484
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the right way of thinking about </v>

152
00:09:49.151 --> 00:09:50.760
<v Speaker 1>buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting about the pilot where</v>

153
00:09:50.761 --> 00:09:51.594
<v Speaker 1>reaction response in human beings is </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's often manifested to something of </v>

154
00:09:54.341 --> 00:09:57.190
<v Speaker 1>great beauty or great excitement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

155
00:09:57.191 --> 00:09:59.660
<v Speaker 1>so anyways that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

156
00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.280
<v Speaker 1>that reaction is so old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My point is that reaction is so old that</v>

157
00:10:03.281 --> 00:10:07.030
<v Speaker 1>we still have hangovers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological hangovers from it,</v>

158
00:10:07.031 --> 00:10:07.864
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From the time when it was actually </v>

159
00:10:08.891 --> 00:10:09.724
<v Speaker 1>useful for us to puff up our for and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a long time ago and so I don't </v>

160
00:10:14.231 --> 00:10:17.710
<v Speaker 1>think it's unreasonable to presuppose </v>
<v Speaker 1>the chimpanzees can feel something like,</v>

161
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:18.563
<v Speaker 1>aw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I would also like to point out that </v>

162
00:10:21.281 --> 00:10:23.440
<v Speaker 1>our can be felt to a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>

163
00:10:23.441 --> 00:10:24.274
<v Speaker 1>So I think that what a low ranking chimp</v>
<v Speaker 1>feels to a very high ranking chimp is </v>

164
00:10:29.651 --> 00:10:34.651
<v Speaker 1>also something akin to all the reason I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that is,</v>

165
00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:40.090
<v Speaker 1>well first because of how low ranking </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimps act around high ranking chimps,</v>

166
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:45.610
<v Speaker 1>the act subordinate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also because there has been studies,</v>

167
00:10:45.611 --> 00:10:48.730
<v Speaker 1>there have been studies with monkeys and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think these were done with Vervets,</v>

168
00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:51.580
<v Speaker 1>although I'm not precisely sure of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>breed.</v>

169
00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:52.623
<v Speaker 1>They showed vervets troop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took vervets from a troop and they </v>

170
00:10:56.711 --> 00:10:58.690
<v Speaker 1>showed verve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pictures of the low ranking.</v>

171
00:10:58.691 --> 00:11:01.060
<v Speaker 1>I told you this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the low ranking vervets,</v>

172
00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:02.103
<v Speaker 1>and they showed pictures that verve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pictures of the high ranking </v>

173
00:11:04.391 --> 00:11:09.391
<v Speaker 1>vervets and the verbiage preferred to </v>
<v Speaker 1>gaze at the high ranking vervets.</v>

174
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:10.613
<v Speaker 1>And so the vervets were the high ranking</v>
<v Speaker 1>vervets were the target of their </v>

175
00:11:13.571 --> 00:11:15.460
<v Speaker 1>retention now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

176
00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:19.663
<v Speaker 3>Perfect,</v>

177
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.033
<v Speaker 1>they knew them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there might also be something about </v>

178
00:11:24.441 --> 00:11:26.390
<v Speaker 1>them physically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the answer to that.</v>

179
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:27.463
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that human beings can </v>

180
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:35.710
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically can look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are an array of middle aged men and pick</v>

181
00:11:36.981 --> 00:11:37.814
<v Speaker 1>out the ceos without knowing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can do it at better than chance </v>

182
00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.213
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not exactly sure what cues are </v>

183
00:11:44.631 --> 00:11:45.464
<v Speaker 1>being used or maybe they are and I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know the literature well enough </v>

184
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:49.580
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might be,</v>

185
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.540
<v Speaker 1>that might be part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

186
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:54.160
<v Speaker 1>so we do pick up cues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance that are,</v>

187
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.090
<v Speaker 1>I think their innate wide jaws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them,</v>

188
00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.153
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's weird variations on this </v>

189
00:12:00.581 --> 00:12:01.570
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I can tell you,</v>

190
00:12:01.571 --> 00:12:02.404
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you show women pictures of the same </v>

191
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:10.831
<v Speaker 1>man and you vary the jaw width.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the women are ovulating,</v>

192
00:12:11.441 --> 00:12:15.100
<v Speaker 1>they liked the guy with the thick jaw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavy jaw.</v>

193
00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:15.934
<v Speaker 1>And when they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're completely opposite to </v>

194
00:12:17.471 --> 00:12:19.810
<v Speaker 1>ovulating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they liked the guy with the thinner jaw.</v>

195
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.290
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

196
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.133
<v Speaker 1>I think this is part of the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 1>women have trouble with men now </v>

197
00:12:25.131 --> 00:12:25.964
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think that from a sexual </v>

198
00:12:28.061 --> 00:12:28.894
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might be more wired to be </v>

199
00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:33.640
<v Speaker 1>attractive to men who produce monstrous </v>
<v Speaker 1>sons,</v>

200
00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:35.740
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like powerful,</v>

201
00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:41.060
<v Speaker 1>attractive sons because from an </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary perspective,</v>

202
00:12:41.061 --> 00:12:43.730
<v Speaker 1>you're much more likely to get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandchild or to speak,</v>

203
00:12:43.731 --> 00:12:47.000
<v Speaker 1>to speak in a more Darwinian sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're more likely to pass on your genes</v>

204
00:12:47.001 --> 00:12:50.180
<v Speaker 1>if you have a son who's successful at </v>
<v Speaker 1>attracting mates.</v>

205
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:51.583
<v Speaker 1>And there's no reason to assume that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>man who will produce sons that's more </v>

206
00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:55.693
<v Speaker 1>more capable of attracting mates is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be the sort of man a that will </v>

207
00:12:59.601 --> 00:13:00.434
<v Speaker 1>treat you right or b won't fool around </v>
<v Speaker 1>because basically you're gambling in </v>

208
00:13:04.161 --> 00:13:04.994
<v Speaker 1>some sense that your son will have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to fool around because </v>

209
00:13:08.001 --> 00:13:11.210
<v Speaker 1>that's your best bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In terms of moving your genetic material</v>

210
00:13:11.211 --> 00:13:12.044
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>

211
00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.720
<v Speaker 4>why is it that white job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it</v>

212
00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:18.520
<v Speaker 1>dominance testosterone?</v>

213
00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:24.150
<v Speaker 4>Has it been shown that people with live </v>
<v Speaker 4>jobs are actually more.</v>

214
00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.490
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its teeth we bite.</v>

215
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.630
<v Speaker 1>So a heavy more muscular jaw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people don't anymore,</v>

216
00:13:30.631 --> 00:13:34.080
<v Speaker 1>but chimpanzees certainly bite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

217
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:35.880
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are.</v>

218
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.090
<v Speaker 1>Wider face is one of the markers </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>

219
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:40.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

220
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:41.730
<v Speaker 1>So these are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

221
00:13:41.731 --> 00:13:43.950
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say they're overwhelmingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful effects,</v>

222
00:13:43.951 --> 00:13:45.750
<v Speaker 1>but they're detectable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

223
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:50.190
<v Speaker 1>So know it also goes along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think with some things like preference</v>

224
00:13:50.191 --> 00:13:51.024
<v Speaker 1>for symmetry because you know there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher probability that an asymmetrical </v>

225
00:13:56.641 --> 00:13:57.474
<v Speaker 1>person has had something go wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them at some point in their biological </v>

226
00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:01.464
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people find it symmetrical people </v>

227
00:14:03.121 --> 00:14:07.530
<v Speaker 1>more attractive and that that's true </v>
<v Speaker 1>even for for creatures like butterflies.</v>

228
00:14:07.531 --> 00:14:08.364
<v Speaker 1>So there are butterflies that will not </v>
<v Speaker 1>meet with another butterfly even if </v>

229
00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:16.820
<v Speaker 1>they're asymmetrical by almost an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unmeasurable amount is they're very,</v>

230
00:14:17.131 --> 00:14:17.964
<v Speaker 1>very attuned to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what this symbol stands for as </v>

231
00:14:29.991 --> 00:14:30.824
<v Speaker 1>far as I can tell is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which exists beyond our comprehension </v>

232
00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.940
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's different than something unknown.</v>

233
00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.850
<v Speaker 1>It's different in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>

234
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:45.303
<v Speaker 1>You remember the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember the hierarchy diagram I showed </v>

235
00:14:48.341 --> 00:14:49.480
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I showed you that over and over,</v>

236
00:14:49.481 --> 00:14:50.620
<v Speaker 1>right with the little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

237
00:14:50.621 --> 00:14:51.454
<v Speaker 1>the high resolution actions at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom and then the really low </v>

238
00:14:53.211 --> 00:14:54.044
<v Speaker 1>resolution actions at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you can think about it this </v>

239
00:14:58.071 --> 00:14:58.904
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the unknown seems to be able to be </v>

240
00:15:01.311 --> 00:15:06.311
<v Speaker 1>represented by this serpent reptile </v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory symbol.</v>

241
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:11.930
<v Speaker 1>It also seems to be able to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>represented by the negative feminine and</v>

242
00:15:11.931 --> 00:15:14.390
<v Speaker 1>it also seems to be represented by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive feminine.</v>

243
00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.830
<v Speaker 1>And so Mandy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think about that hierarchy,</v>

244
00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:19.993
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that the trivial </v>
<v Speaker 1>novelties you know that you encountered </v>

245
00:15:25.281 --> 00:15:28.100
<v Speaker 1>whenever you do something wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's only a small mistake.</v>

246
00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:29.293
<v Speaker 1>Those trivial novelties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe their best symbolized by the </v>

247
00:15:31.641 --> 00:15:32.474
<v Speaker 1>positive mother because they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to blow you into pieces just </v>

248
00:15:35.211 --> 00:15:37.790
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you've encountered a small error</v>

249
00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.730
<v Speaker 1>and you'll learn something from it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it won't be very costly.</v>

250
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:45.440
<v Speaker 1>You might even be interested in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I think as you go higher up the</v>

251
00:15:45.441 --> 00:15:46.274
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's likely that the positive mother </v>

252
00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:52.130
<v Speaker 1>representation is gonna Shade into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative mother representation.</v>

253
00:15:52.131 --> 00:15:56.690
<v Speaker 1>Because what's happening is if you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>hint at a high level of abstraction,</v>

254
00:15:56.691 --> 00:15:57.524
<v Speaker 1>is that it's going to start to demolish </v>
<v Speaker 1>larger and larger proportions of your </v>

255
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:04.610
<v Speaker 1>personality structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe at the very top.</v>

256
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.970
<v Speaker 1>The thing that would demolish that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this.</v>

257
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.313
<v Speaker 1>It's this for the same reason that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the thing that would eat you if you </v>

258
00:16:12.771 --> 00:16:13.604
<v Speaker 1>went to a far away from your tribe or </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the thing that would eat you if </v>

259
00:16:16.941 --> 00:16:21.941
<v Speaker 1>you move too far away from the fire or </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you fell out of the tree,</v>

260
00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:23.793
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the thing that would slither along </v>

261
00:16:24.831 --> 00:16:25.664
<v Speaker 1>the branches and swallow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You maybe swallow your offspring </v>

262
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.130
<v Speaker 1>millions of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might think,</v>

263
00:16:31.131 --> 00:16:31.964
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there any reason to presuppose that </v>

264
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:36.560
<v Speaker 1>those experiences left traces on us?</v>

265
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.393
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

266
00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:38.293
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually think that the propositions </v>

267
00:16:40.911 --> 00:16:43.520
<v Speaker 1>that psychologist started with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this happens very frequently,</v>

268
00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:44.593
<v Speaker 1>are backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the onus is on people to prove </v>

269
00:16:47.451 --> 00:16:52.190
<v Speaker 1>that our minds aren't structured by our </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological and evolutionary past.</v>

270
00:16:52.191 --> 00:16:53.990
<v Speaker 1>Rather than that they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

271
00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.390
<v Speaker 1>the whole bloody physiology is </v>
<v Speaker 1>structured.</v>

272
00:16:56.391 --> 00:16:58.040
<v Speaker 1>The entire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

273
00:16:58.041 --> 00:17:00.620
<v Speaker 1>the body in which the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body,</v>

274
00:17:00.621 --> 00:17:04.130
<v Speaker 1>the mind and habits is structured by </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary processes.</v>

275
00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

276
00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:11.270
<v Speaker 1>we know that there are certain sets of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty formulaic cues that men and women</v>

277
00:17:11.271 --> 00:17:12.104
<v Speaker 1>use to evaluate each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those don't seem to be learned in </v>

278
00:17:14.511 --> 00:17:16.760
<v Speaker 1>any important way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although learning can modify them,</v>

279
00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.610
<v Speaker 1>we know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

280
00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:19.820
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>

281
00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:20.743
<v Speaker 1>we're not born able to speak a language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we are born able to babble the full </v>

282
00:17:26.141 --> 00:17:29.270
<v Speaker 1>names of all languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know if you know that,</v>

283
00:17:29.271 --> 00:17:32.300
<v Speaker 1>but when a baby's laying in their crib </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're babbling,</v>

284
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.333
<v Speaker 1>they're capable of babbling virtually </v>
<v Speaker 1>every noise human beings used in all of </v>

285
00:17:38.241 --> 00:17:39.080
<v Speaker 1>their languages.</v>

286
00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:44.240
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens is that they lose </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to babble all the names that</v>

287
00:17:44.241 --> 00:17:45.074
<v Speaker 1>aren't used in that language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's very difficult often for </v>

288
00:17:48.531 --> 00:17:51.750
<v Speaker 1>an adult either learn to hear or to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>those full needs.</v>

289
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.940
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So babies are obviously born prepared to</v>

290
00:17:56.941 --> 00:18:00.180
<v Speaker 1>learn the language and it's not like we </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually teach them to speak.</v>

291
00:18:00.181 --> 00:18:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

292
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:05.820
<v Speaker 1>we might make minor corrections now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then and tell them how to say a word,</v>

293
00:18:05.821 --> 00:18:08.550
<v Speaker 1>but most of the time they just pick it </v>
<v Speaker 1>up by observing.</v>

294
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.700
<v Speaker 1>And they do it very rapidly and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly good at it.</v>

295
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:12.563
<v Speaker 1>So clearly that's biologically prepared </v>
<v Speaker 1>because no other animal does it and you </v>

296
00:18:19.771 --> 00:18:22.920
<v Speaker 1>can't get other animals to do it really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except maybe parrots,</v>

297
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:27.840
<v Speaker 1>African gray parrots turn out to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary language users.</v>

298
00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but other animals,</v>

299
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:34.800
<v Speaker 1>you don't get very far with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might get to the word level or maybe</v>

300
00:18:34.801 --> 00:18:36.570
<v Speaker 1>to the simple sentence level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

301
00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:40.260
<v Speaker 1>when people have claimed that chimps </v>
<v Speaker 1>have got up to the three year old level,</v>

302
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:45.270
<v Speaker 1>but about obviously you're pushing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rock up a steep hill.</v>

303
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:46.163
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a straightforward thing for an </v>

304
00:18:47.371 --> 00:18:49.890
<v Speaker 1>animal to pick up language like a human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being just,</v>

305
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:51.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just drop them in there and Poof,</v>

306
00:18:51.991 --> 00:18:52.824
<v Speaker 1>away they go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So obviously there's something about us </v>

307
00:18:54.421 --> 00:18:55.254
<v Speaker 1>that's prepared for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course we can talk and I don't </v>

308
00:18:58.741 --> 00:18:59.574
<v Speaker 1>know if you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but our whole breathing apparatus is </v>

309
00:19:02.581 --> 00:19:07.581
<v Speaker 1>oddly designed to allow us to talk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can control our breathing very well.</v>

310
00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.053
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

311
00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:11.823
<v Speaker 1>compared to most animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can hold our breath and we can </v>

312
00:19:13.451 --> 00:19:15.520
<v Speaker 1>exhale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it actually,</v>

313
00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:16.503
<v Speaker 1>that modification actually makes this </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly more prone to choking when we </v>

314
00:19:20.231 --> 00:19:22.810
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because most animals can't do that,</v>

315
00:19:22.811 --> 00:19:25.330
<v Speaker 1>but because of the peculiar way our </v>
<v Speaker 1>throat and our,</v>

316
00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:26.900
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

317
00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:27.853
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

318
00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:30.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the name of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately.</v>

319
00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:36.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And brachial brachial tubes,</v>

320
00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:39.160
<v Speaker 1>the way their throat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

321
00:19:39.161 --> 00:19:39.970
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>

322
00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:40.960
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

323
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:45.040
<v Speaker 1>The way those are arranged that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of conflict with each other now and</v>

324
00:19:45.041 --> 00:19:46.620
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that can't happen in animals.</v>

325
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:49.870
<v Speaker 1>So not only are we prepared mentally to </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak,</v>

326
00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:50.883
<v Speaker 1>but we're too to learn language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're prepared physiologically to </v>

327
00:19:53.831 --> 00:19:54.664
<v Speaker 1>speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means we have tremendous </v>

328
00:19:55.841 --> 00:19:59.680
<v Speaker 1>control over our tongue and we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous control over our lips and our</v>

329
00:19:59.681 --> 00:20:02.920
<v Speaker 1>breathing and all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of hard to believe,</v>

330
00:20:02.921 --> 00:20:03.754
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we'd have this whole physiology </v>

331
00:20:04.871 --> 00:20:05.704
<v Speaker 1>that's evolved to be devoted to language</v>
<v Speaker 1>without having a biological substrate </v>

332
00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:13.590
<v Speaker 1>for language somehow as part of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological mental makeup.</v>

333
00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:16.383
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with regards to the relationships </v>

334
00:20:18.131 --> 00:20:20.740
<v Speaker 1>between the sexes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean sex is very old.</v>

335
00:20:20.741 --> 00:20:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Sexual differentiation is exceptionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

336
00:20:23.501 --> 00:20:26.620
<v Speaker 1>The probability that we're not evolved </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that is zero.</v>

337
00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:28.293
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to show you another </v>

338
00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:37.413
<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to tell you a little bit about </v>

339
00:20:38.591 --> 00:20:39.730
<v Speaker 1>this one first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

340
00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.730
<v Speaker 1>so this symbol means a lot of things go </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

341
00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.510
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a dragon.</v>

342
00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.790
<v Speaker 1>It's a serpent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a snake,</v>

343
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.570
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's it.</v>

344
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:55.270
<v Speaker 1>It's also a lizard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a predatory thing and it's.</v>

345
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:56.943
<v Speaker 1>It can breathe fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the characteristics of a </v>

346
00:20:58.421 --> 00:20:59.254
<v Speaker 1>dragon and fire is a transformative </v>
<v Speaker 1>substance and it's a very mysterious </v>

347
00:21:02.171 --> 00:21:03.004
<v Speaker 1>substance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things you might note </v>

348
00:21:03.761 --> 00:21:04.594
<v Speaker 1>about fires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens when you're sitting around </v>

349
00:21:05.921 --> 00:21:10.180
<v Speaker 1>a campfire?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you look at the fire?</v>

350
00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't not look at a fire.</v>

351
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:14.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's a baby in the room,</v>

352
00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:14.980
<v Speaker 1>a two year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna.</v>

353
00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:17.140
<v Speaker 1>Look at that two year old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't keep your eyes off.</v>

354
00:21:17.141 --> 00:21:20.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like a flickering TV and fires like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that for people.</v>

355
00:21:20.441 --> 00:21:25.180
<v Speaker 1>We can't keep her demise off it and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think the reason for that was that we're</v>

356
00:21:25.181 --> 00:21:26.014
<v Speaker 1>all descended from the first creature </v>
<v Speaker 1>who decided that he was going to play </v>

357
00:21:29.111 --> 00:21:31.450
<v Speaker 1>around with fire far more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

358
00:21:31.451 --> 00:21:35.110
<v Speaker 1>he probably came home with his furl </v>
<v Speaker 1>burnt off when he was an adolescent,</v>

359
00:21:35.111 --> 00:21:36.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his mother said,</v>

360
00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.410
<v Speaker 1>are you out there playing with fire </v>
<v Speaker 1>again?</v>

361
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:38.921
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

362
00:21:38.921 --> 00:21:40.480
<v Speaker 1>I can't help it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

363
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:41.703
<v Speaker 1>is a mutation that made it impossible </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that creature to become accustomed </v>

364
00:21:47.021 --> 00:21:49.330
<v Speaker 1>to fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was fascinated by it.</v>

365
00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:50.643
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once we had fire there was no stopping </v>

366
00:21:53.381 --> 00:21:54.214
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the probability that we're all </v>

367
00:21:55.961 --> 00:21:59.800
<v Speaker 1>descended from arsonist apes is </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely high.</v>

368
00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.970
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

369
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:07.900
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt.</v>

370
00:22:07.901 --> 00:22:10.930
<v Speaker 1>No doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Insane fire wielding chimpanzees.</v>

371
00:22:10.931 --> 00:22:12.400
<v Speaker 1>That's our ancestors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

372
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.270
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fire is a transformative substance,</v>

373
00:22:16.271 --> 00:22:16.641
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

374
00:22:16.641 --> 00:22:17.770
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's strange.</v>

375
00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:22.930
<v Speaker 1>It's this strange mode of material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you put something into it,</v>

376
00:22:22.931 --> 00:22:25.420
<v Speaker 1>it turns into something else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very,</v>

377
00:22:25.421 --> 00:22:26.830
<v Speaker 1>very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

378
00:22:26.831 --> 00:22:29.530
<v Speaker 1>which is also an extraordinarily useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>as it turns out.</v>

379
00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:34.980
<v Speaker 1>So the fire fire is a fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not only a transformative phenomenon,</v>

380
00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.910
<v Speaker 1>but it can be used to represent other </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformative phenomena.</v>

381
00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.153
<v Speaker 1>So the dragon is something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>innately attractive for a whole variety </v>

382
00:22:45.251 --> 00:22:47.770
<v Speaker 1>of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can breathe fire.</v>

383
00:22:47.771 --> 00:22:49.780
<v Speaker 1>It's very predatory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also,</v>

384
00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:50.883
<v Speaker 1>it's also an infinite creature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why it has its tail in it's </v>

385
00:22:54.041 --> 00:22:56.680
<v Speaker 1>mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's self contained,</v>

386
00:22:56.681 --> 00:22:58.960
<v Speaker 1>it needs nothing else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

387
00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:03.400
<v Speaker 1>and this is where the symbols starts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stretch beyond the representation of the</v>

388
00:23:03.401 --> 00:23:06.700
<v Speaker 1>Predator to the representation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>

389
00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:08.850
<v Speaker 1>As such,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

390
00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:13.480
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things you might wonder if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a human being is,</v>

391
00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.520
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the unknown like?</v>

392
00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:18.880
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why do you have to understand that?</v>

393
00:23:18.881 --> 00:23:19.714
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is because it's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things come leaping out of the unknown </v>

394
00:23:22.271 --> 00:23:24.070
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might ask,</v>

395
00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:25.173
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it better to figure out how to deal </v>

396
00:23:26.141 --> 00:23:26.974
<v Speaker 1>with each of those horrible things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is it better to learn how to deal </v>

397
00:23:30.341 --> 00:23:32.680
<v Speaker 1>with the source of all those terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

398
00:23:32.681 --> 00:23:33.514
<v Speaker 1>which would be the unknown itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you remember ty and Matt in the </v>

399
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:40.570
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamian myth when she went to war </v>
<v Speaker 1>against Marduk,</v>

400
00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:44.140
<v Speaker 1>she was sort of in the background and </v>
<v Speaker 1>created all sorts of monsters.</v>

401
00:23:44.141 --> 00:23:46.160
<v Speaker 1>And then they all went to battle against</v>
<v Speaker 1>Murdoch.</v>

402
00:23:46.161 --> 00:23:46.994
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to tell you a dream that my</v>
<v Speaker 1>nephew had and I think this is a good </v>

403
00:23:49.671 --> 00:23:54.671
<v Speaker 1>way of representing what this symbol </v>
<v Speaker 1>means and remember human beings abstract</v>

404
00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:57.883
<v Speaker 1>and so what we're trying to do is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at singular phenomena and abstract </v>

405
00:24:02.571 --> 00:24:07.280
<v Speaker 1>out what's common across them so that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can learn to deal with the common things</v>

406
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.233
<v Speaker 1>so that we can apply it to the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>set of those things instead of having </v>

407
00:24:11.631 --> 00:24:12.050
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

408
00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:12.730
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

409
00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:13.563
<v Speaker 1>we know in some sense possibly that </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings can do this and animals </v>

410
00:24:17.061 --> 00:24:17.894
<v Speaker 1>can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I went and heard Temple grandin </v>

411
00:24:20.001 --> 00:24:23.180
<v Speaker 1>speak at one point and I don't know if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know who temple grandin is,</v>

412
00:24:23.181 --> 00:24:28.181
<v Speaker 1>but she's probably the most accomplished</v>
<v Speaker 1>autistic professor and she has.</v>

413
00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:34.580
<v Speaker 1>She has built,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she was a small child,</v>

414
00:24:34.581 --> 00:24:35.414
<v Speaker 1>she learned that if she built this </v>
<v Speaker 1>enclosure that Kinda tightened in on </v>

415
00:24:38.911 --> 00:24:40.130
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it would calm her down.</v>

416
00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:41.533
<v Speaker 1>And she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she applied the thing she learned that </v>

417
00:24:44.991 --> 00:24:49.790
<v Speaker 1>would calm her down to calming down </v>
<v Speaker 1>cattle when they're being,</v>

418
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:53.060
<v Speaker 1>when they're being held in pens prior to</v>
<v Speaker 1>being slaughtered.</v>

419
00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:54.373
<v Speaker 1>And so she's redesigned all the cattle </v>
<v Speaker 1>handling facilities or many of the </v>

420
00:24:58.731 --> 00:25:02.450
<v Speaker 1>candle cattle handling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>handling facilities in the United States</v>

421
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:03.793
<v Speaker 1>to keep the animals calm and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things she's designed is this kind of </v>

422
00:25:08.511 --> 00:25:13.511
<v Speaker 1>spiral enclosure so the cows can't see </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's in front of them basically.</v>

423
00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:17.060
<v Speaker 1>And it's fenced in because if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if cows are going down a,</v>

424
00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:18.673
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an enclosed area like an alley and </v>

425
00:25:21.381 --> 00:25:25.370
<v Speaker 1>there's a coke can lying in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>

426
00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:26.293
<v Speaker 1>they'll all stop and look at the coke </v>
<v Speaker 1>can or they'd stop and look at a </v>

427
00:25:28.701 --> 00:25:30.860
<v Speaker 1>briefcase there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of freaked out by these things.</v>

428
00:25:30.861 --> 00:25:31.694
<v Speaker 1>And if they're walking down a enclosure </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's open and there's a windmill or </v>

429
00:25:35.421 --> 00:25:38.930
<v Speaker 1>something spinning off to the side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll stop and look at that too.</v>

430
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Now Temple Grandin and thinks that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks like an animal,</v>

431
00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:46.880
<v Speaker 1>which is why she thinks that she can </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how animals think.</v>

432
00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.340
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember her,</v>

433
00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.480
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her presentation,</v>

434
00:25:53.481 --> 00:25:55.040
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

435
00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.950
<v Speaker 1>So if I say to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>church,</v>

436
00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:01.460
<v Speaker 1>what do you see in your mind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just anybody.</v>

437
00:26:01.461 --> 00:26:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Tell me what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the.</v>

438
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:05.430
<v Speaker 1>What's the prototypical church?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

439
00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:06.080
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

440
00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:06.861
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would it appear?</v>

441
00:26:06.861 --> 00:26:07.694
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

442
00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

443
00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Does that seem reasonable to people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

444
00:26:12.481 --> 00:26:13.314
<v Speaker 1>What led?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What popped into your mind when I said </v>

445
00:26:15.411 --> 00:26:18.440
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Church bells.</v>

446
00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:20.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

447
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.280
<v Speaker 1>Stained glass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

448
00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:23.443
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when temple grandin thinks of </v>

449
00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:26.533
<v Speaker 1>church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't think of church she thinks </v>

450
00:26:27.831 --> 00:26:32.831
<v Speaker 1>of at Church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She can't abstract out the commonalities</v>

451
00:26:33.081 --> 00:26:33.914
<v Speaker 1>across churches and she thinks that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>partly why autistic people have a hard </v>

452
00:26:37.401 --> 00:26:41.420
<v Speaker 1>time learning language because for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>autistic person there aren't.</v>

453
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:42.463
<v Speaker 1>There isn't the prototypical church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are just churches and she thinks </v>

454
00:26:48.031 --> 00:26:51.300
<v Speaker 1>that's how animals see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They see the particulars.</v>

455
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:57.200
<v Speaker 1>They don't see the abstracted universals</v>
<v Speaker 1>that unite the particulars.</v>

456
00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.193
<v Speaker 1>And of course that makes sense if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it and you know one way of </v>

457
00:27:00.781 --> 00:27:05.781
<v Speaker 1>thinking about that too is that until </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can abstract out the,</v>

458
00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:10.290
<v Speaker 1>the common era commonalities across a </v>
<v Speaker 1>class of phenomena,</v>

459
00:27:10.291 --> 00:27:12.090
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you have to do that in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>image,</v>

460
00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:13.613
<v Speaker 1>you can talk because you can't use the </v>
<v Speaker 1>word church unless what you do when you </v>

461
00:27:20.611 --> 00:27:24.900
<v Speaker 1>receive the word church is apply it to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>class of phenomena.</v>

462
00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that may have very little in common from</v>

463
00:27:27.091 --> 00:27:27.924
<v Speaker 1>a visual perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just think about how different a </v>

464
00:27:30.211 --> 00:27:32.400
<v Speaker 1>given church looks from different </v>
<v Speaker 1>angles.</v>

465
00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:34.013
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you knew about the </v>

466
00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:38.190
<v Speaker 1>autistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're artistic Savannah's who can draw</v>

467
00:27:38.191 --> 00:27:42.480
<v Speaker 1>like mad and so you can see some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people on Youtube.</v>

468
00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:44.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean one guy is just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

469
00:27:44.431 --> 00:27:45.264
<v Speaker 1>He's so amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just staggers the imagination </v>

470
00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:48.863
<v Speaker 1>making fly them across the city and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>helicopter and then he can go home and </v>

471
00:27:52.291 --> 00:27:55.860
<v Speaker 1>they own this huge piece of paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Draw the whole city.</v>

472
00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:57.743
<v Speaker 1>He can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It only has to see it for about an hour </v>

473
00:27:58.861 --> 00:28:02.190
<v Speaker 1>and he can draw the windows and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and their artistic people who</v>

474
00:28:02.191 --> 00:28:04.920
<v Speaker 1>can figure out how many windows are on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>building with one glance.</v>

475
00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:07.050
<v Speaker 1>They don't see things the same way we </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

476
00:28:07.051 --> 00:28:10.380
<v Speaker 1>They don't see the abstractions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals don't seem to either.</v>

477
00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:11.723
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I'm telling you that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you got to understand the </v>

478
00:28:15.361 --> 00:28:18.630
<v Speaker 1>process of abstraction before you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what symbols mean.</v>

479
00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:19.493
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what young believer that assembled did </v>

480
00:28:20.701 --> 00:28:21.534
<v Speaker 1>was exactly what I just described,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was that there's a class of </v>

481
00:28:25.831 --> 00:28:30.831
<v Speaker 1>phenomena that were struggling to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand and the way that we build our</v>

482
00:28:31.021 --> 00:28:31.854
<v Speaker 1>first representations of it is an image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like you had the image of a church </v>

483
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.070
<v Speaker 1>and then you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

484
00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:38.933
<v Speaker 1>you can label that image with a word and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can use the word Madel evoke </v>

485
00:28:42.091 --> 00:28:44.520
<v Speaker 1>the image and that will evoke the class </v>
<v Speaker 1>of phenomena.</v>

486
00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:47.970
<v Speaker 1>But part of the reason that that normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

487
00:28:47.971 --> 00:28:50.790
<v Speaker 1>human beings can't draw is because when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they draw,</v>

488
00:28:50.791 --> 00:28:52.880
<v Speaker 1>they draw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they draw here or glyphic.</v>

489
00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:55.330
<v Speaker 1>So think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

490
00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:58.200
<v Speaker 1>you think a child's drawing of a person </v>
<v Speaker 1>is very primitive,</v>

491
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:59.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had stick,</v>

492
00:28:59.521 --> 00:29:00.151
<v Speaker 1>stick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stick,</v>

493
00:29:00.151 --> 00:29:00.540
<v Speaker 1>stick.</v>

494
00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:03.840
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they put little circles on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>feet or something and you think,</v>

495
00:29:03.841 --> 00:29:05.730
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty primitive.</v>

496
00:29:05.731 --> 00:29:06.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>

497
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:09.300
<v Speaker 1>That's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really sophisticated.</v>

498
00:29:09.301 --> 00:29:10.134
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculously sophisticated that a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a child can figure out how to </v>

499
00:29:13.711 --> 00:29:18.711
<v Speaker 1>scheme and ties a person with like five </v>
<v Speaker 1>sticks in a circle and then Maine,</v>

500
00:29:19.131 --> 00:29:21.390
<v Speaker 1>they know that it's a person and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do too.</v>

501
00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.880
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not primitive now,</v>

502
00:29:23.881 --> 00:29:27.200
<v Speaker 1>the autistic savant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

503
00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:29.910
<v Speaker 1>they seem to draw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They seem to be able to draw.</v>

504
00:29:29.911 --> 00:29:33.150
<v Speaker 1>So Dan accurately because they don't see</v>
<v Speaker 1>the abstraction,</v>

505
00:29:33.151 --> 00:29:33.984
<v Speaker 1>they just see the particularities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So another really interesting phenomena </v>

506
00:29:37.351 --> 00:29:40.020
<v Speaker 1>that goes along with autistic drawing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you'll see,</v>

507
00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.700
<v Speaker 1>remember this girl who could draw horses</v>
<v Speaker 1>like mad,</v>

508
00:29:42.701 --> 00:29:45.280
<v Speaker 1>she lost the ability later when she </v>
<v Speaker 1>picked up language,</v>

509
00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.740
<v Speaker 1>but she could start with any part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>horse.</v>

510
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:49.810
<v Speaker 1>She could start by drawing the tail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

511
00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:54.520
<v Speaker 1>which is not how a normal person would </v>
<v Speaker 1>draw a horse at all.</v>

512
00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:55.353
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all you'd sort of centered on </v>

513
00:29:56.231 --> 00:29:59.710
<v Speaker 1>the paper and then you maybe you'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>sketch it in and like it's work.</v>

514
00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.800
<v Speaker 1>You just don't start somewhere and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>draw out a whole horse.</v>

515
00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:05.680
<v Speaker 1>And her horse drawings were like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo Quality.</v>

516
00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:08.440
<v Speaker 1>They're remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

517
00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:10.383
<v Speaker 1>so this symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is the symbol that people </v>

518
00:30:12.581 --> 00:30:13.414
<v Speaker 1>were using or that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we use to represent the ultimate </v>

519
00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:18.003
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the ultimate unknown is a very </v>

520
00:30:19.331 --> 00:30:20.164
<v Speaker 1>difficult thing to represent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this symbol is making a case and </v>

521
00:30:23.621 --> 00:30:24.311
<v Speaker 1>the case is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

522
00:30:24.311 --> 00:30:25.144
<v Speaker 1>it's something like fire because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformative substance and it's </v>

523
00:30:27.671 --> 00:30:28.504
<v Speaker 1>something like a predatory reptiles </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it lurks in places where you </v>

524
00:30:31.811 --> 00:30:35.500
<v Speaker 1>don't expect it to look and it can </v>
<v Speaker 1>consume you and not an end.</v>

525
00:30:35.501 --> 00:30:40.290
<v Speaker 1>It's also something like a spirit or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bird of the air because it has wings and</v>

526
00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:41.320
<v Speaker 1>and why that is.</v>

527
00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.153
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's because things come </v>

528
00:30:42.731 --> 00:30:47.731
<v Speaker 1>swooping down that you don't expect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's lots of pr primates,</v>

529
00:30:48.161 --> 00:30:51.910
<v Speaker 1>small primates that are attacked fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequently by predatory birds.</v>

530
00:30:51.911 --> 00:30:54.310
<v Speaker 1>And so the error is another place where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the unknown can emerge,</v>

531
00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:55.353
<v Speaker 1>but the air is also sort of the place of</v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit and the ground is sort of the </v>

532
00:30:58.241 --> 00:30:59.074
<v Speaker 1>place of matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this symbol here is a </v>

533
00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:05.530
<v Speaker 1>representation of the conjoined union of</v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit and matter.</v>

534
00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:08.470
<v Speaker 1>And I'll talk about that a bit later </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's a very,</v>

535
00:31:08.471 --> 00:31:11.440
<v Speaker 1>very complicated idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And okay,</v>

536
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.570
<v Speaker 1>now I'm going to tell you my nephew's </v>
<v Speaker 1>dream.</v>

537
00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:14.433
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was about five and he was having </v>

538
00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.980
<v Speaker 1>nightmares and during the day and night </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrors.</v>

539
00:31:24.981 --> 00:31:28.080
<v Speaker 1>So He'd wake up screaming and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>people ask them what the problem was,</v>

540
00:31:28.081 --> 00:31:30.510
<v Speaker 1>he didn't know which is quite common </v>
<v Speaker 1>with night terrors with children,</v>

541
00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:34.620
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can kind of infer that he was having</v>

542
00:31:34.621 --> 00:31:37.410
<v Speaker 1>terrible visions at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

543
00:31:37.411 --> 00:31:38.244
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the day he was running around </v>

544
00:31:39.841 --> 00:31:44.841
<v Speaker 1>with a plastic night hat and a and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sword and a playing night and you know,</v>

545
00:31:48.341 --> 00:31:50.230
<v Speaker 1>and you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why would he play night?</v>

546
00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:51.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's,</v>

547
00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:53.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly why it would play </v>
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>

548
00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:53.953
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd watched Disney cartoons and that </v>

549
00:31:55.121 --> 00:31:57.430
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing and he'd been exposed to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair bit of media.</v>

550
00:31:57.431 --> 00:31:58.264
<v Speaker 1>So his little brain was picking up </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypes in some sense and he was </v>

551
00:32:02.951 --> 00:32:06.040
<v Speaker 1>acting them out trying to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they meant and you know,</v>

552
00:32:06.041 --> 00:32:07.990
<v Speaker 1>he's a pretty smart kid and</v>

553
00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:10.523
<v Speaker 1>when you went to bed he'd put the sword </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the little night hat beside it and </v>

554
00:32:13.531 --> 00:32:14.520
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

555
00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:15.563
<v Speaker 1>regardless he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was having night terrors now there </v>

556
00:32:17.461 --> 00:32:18.294
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were some problems in his family </v>

557
00:32:19.411 --> 00:32:22.620
<v Speaker 1>at that point and a divorce happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively soon after.</v>

558
00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:23.633
<v Speaker 1>So there were things lurking under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>surface around him and he was also </v>

559
00:32:26.431 --> 00:32:28.860
<v Speaker 1>preparing to go to kindergarten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is definitely,</v>

560
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:30.023
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you take a step out into the </v>

561
00:32:31.081 --> 00:32:33.300
<v Speaker 1>broader world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that happens to be.</v>

562
00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:37.440
<v Speaker 1>So he was surrounded by unknown things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

563
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:40.783
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

564
00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:42.043
<v Speaker 1>one night when I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had night terrors and he came to sit </v>

565
00:32:46.041 --> 00:32:50.290
<v Speaker 1>at the table with his family and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>family and um,</v>

566
00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:51.643
<v Speaker 1>I asked him if he dreamed about anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said he got very intense and he </v>

567
00:32:55.761 --> 00:32:56.594
<v Speaker 1>said yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was out in this field and I was </v>

568
00:33:00.141 --> 00:33:00.974
<v Speaker 1>surrounded by these little dwarfs that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were just only came up to my knees and </v>

569
00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:08.340
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have any arms and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

570
00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:13.760
<v Speaker 1>they had a huge beak like this and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were covered with hair and Greece and on</v>

571
00:33:13.761 --> 00:33:16.790
<v Speaker 1>the top of their head there was a cross </v>
<v Speaker 1>shaved in them and they had big,</v>

572
00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:19.850
<v Speaker 1>strong feet and legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I was walking around,</v>

573
00:33:19.851 --> 00:33:23.210
<v Speaker 1>these things would jump at me and bite </v>
<v Speaker 1>me with their beaks.</v>

574
00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:27.530
<v Speaker 1>With the breakfast table got very quiet </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he said that.</v>

575
00:33:27.531 --> 00:33:29.990
<v Speaker 1>As you might imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty horrifying vision really,</v>

576
00:33:29.991 --> 00:33:31.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

577
00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:32.840
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think,</v>

578
00:33:32.841 --> 00:33:34.610
<v Speaker 1>well that's why he's waking up </v>
<v Speaker 1>screaming.</v>

579
00:33:34.611 --> 00:33:35.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

580
00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:36.043
<v Speaker 1>little</v>

581
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:40.940
<v Speaker 1>peak dwarfs are like gnawing on him at </v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

582
00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:44.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's a reason to be freaked </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

583
00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:48.680
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could you do about that?</v>

584
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.963
<v Speaker 1>And now you see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting question because </v>

585
00:33:52.761 --> 00:33:53.594
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you often think that when you ask </v>

586
00:33:54.651 --> 00:33:57.410
<v Speaker 1>someone a question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they provide you with the answer,</v>

587
00:33:57.411 --> 00:34:01.550
<v Speaker 1>but it's not exactly right because when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you ask them a question you also provide</v>

588
00:34:01.551 --> 00:34:05.240
<v Speaker 1>them with the seed of an answer and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't help that,</v>

589
00:34:05.241 --> 00:34:08.690
<v Speaker 1>which is why it's very difficult not to </v>
<v Speaker 1>lead witnesses in a trial.</v>

590
00:34:08.691 --> 00:34:09.524
<v Speaker 1>And it's also very difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview children because every time </v>

591
00:34:12.381 --> 00:34:15.680
<v Speaker 1>you ask them a question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're inevitably hinting about what you</v>

592
00:34:15.681 --> 00:34:18.380
<v Speaker 1>want the answer to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was doing that on purpose and what</v>

593
00:34:18.381 --> 00:34:19.214
<v Speaker 1>I was telling him was it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically possible that a creature </v>

594
00:34:22.581 --> 00:34:23.414
<v Speaker 1>like you could do something about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if such a creature could do </v>

595
00:34:26.721 --> 00:34:29.090
<v Speaker 1>something about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would it do?</v>

596
00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:31.643
<v Speaker 1>So I was introducing really what I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing was introducing the idea of the </v>

597
00:34:35.431 --> 00:34:36.264
<v Speaker 1>hero to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're beset on all sides by </v>

598
00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:44.700
<v Speaker 1>monstrous enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the appropriate response?</v>

599
00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:46.403
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do know if you have a client who has </v>

600
00:34:48.871 --> 00:34:49.704
<v Speaker 1>nightmares,</v>

601
00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.010
<v Speaker 1>you can get them to envision the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nightmare.</v>

602
00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:57.720
<v Speaker 1>So you say sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>close your eyes,</v>

603
00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:02.190
<v Speaker 1>bring the images back to mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some people are really good at this.</v>

604
00:35:02.191 --> 00:35:03.024
<v Speaker 1>I think my experience has been that </v>
<v Speaker 1>women are better at than men and women </v>

605
00:35:06.181 --> 00:35:08.820
<v Speaker 1>are somewhat more open than men on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>openness dimension.</v>

606
00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.230
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's why they like fiction </v>
<v Speaker 1>better to.</v>

607
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:12.743
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because women like fiction and men like </v>

608
00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.110
<v Speaker 1>nonfiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

609
00:35:16.111 --> 00:35:16.944
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's lots of overlap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you have a client who has a </v>

610
00:35:20.401 --> 00:35:22.350
<v Speaker 1>nightmare and you have them bring it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>

611
00:35:22.351 --> 00:35:23.184
<v Speaker 1>you can get them to change the ending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it has to be some in some cause I </v>

612
00:35:26.401 --> 00:35:27.234
<v Speaker 1>realistic manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had a client once who she had two </v>

613
00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:32.790
<v Speaker 1>fears at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was afraid of mice.</v>

614
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.340
<v Speaker 1>She was particularly afraid of mice </v>
<v Speaker 1>running upper leg,</v>

615
00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.293
<v Speaker 1>which they will do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was also afraid of being </v>

616
00:35:38.851 --> 00:35:42.480
<v Speaker 1>attacked and raped in the cabin that she</v>
<v Speaker 1>had that was north of this was Montreal,</v>

617
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:43.343
<v Speaker 1>north of Montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was a Friday and connection </v>

618
00:35:44.731 --> 00:35:46.560
<v Speaker 1>between the most fear and the fear.</v>

619
00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:51.240
<v Speaker 1>We treated her mouse phobia with </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposure.</v>

620
00:35:51.241 --> 00:35:54.480
<v Speaker 1>I took her to mcgill and where the rat </v>
<v Speaker 1>labs were and you know,</v>

621
00:35:54.481 --> 00:35:58.470
<v Speaker 1>first of all she just kind of peered in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rats and then she got closer and you</v>

622
00:35:58.471 --> 00:35:59.304
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just did graduated exposure and find </v>

623
00:36:01.201 --> 00:36:02.034
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She picked up a rat and petted and all </v>

624
00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.100
<v Speaker 1>the same day by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that was quite.</v>

625
00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:08.240
<v Speaker 1>She was quite happy about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Direct behavior,</v>

626
00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:10.140
<v Speaker 1>behavioral treatment exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

627
00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:13.320
<v Speaker 1>And then with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the whole cabin thing,</v>

628
00:36:13.321 --> 00:36:14.154
<v Speaker 1>what we did was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all suggest that you get a </v>

629
00:36:15.511 --> 00:36:18.960
<v Speaker 1>decent lock and maybe an alarm because </v>
<v Speaker 1>she was up there alone and you know what</v>

630
00:36:18.961 --> 00:36:19.794
<v Speaker 1>the hell part of her fear might've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicated on an observation that she </v>

631
00:36:24.091 --> 00:36:24.924
<v Speaker 1>was at risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was higher than it might be </v>

632
00:36:27.661 --> 00:36:29.100
<v Speaker 1>appropriate to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know,</v>

633
00:36:29.101 --> 00:36:29.934
<v Speaker 1>but you might as well err on the side of</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatism and then maybe she could </v>

634
00:36:32.791 --> 00:36:34.920
<v Speaker 1>bring a dog up there that might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>helpful too.</v>

635
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.310
<v Speaker 1>So that was the practical addressing of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem,</v>

636
00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:42.740
<v Speaker 1>but she had these dreams where some guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>would break in the window and you know,</v>

637
00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:43.883
<v Speaker 1>rape her and so we had her bring the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring the dream to mind and then we'd </v>

638
00:36:48.871 --> 00:36:49.704
<v Speaker 1>armed her with various things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one thing was a bath and another </v>

639
00:36:51.901 --> 00:36:54.990
<v Speaker 1>thing was some rope and another thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a can of ovens spray.</v>

640
00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:58.770
<v Speaker 1>And so when the guy jumped in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she sprayed him with the ovens spray and</v>

641
00:36:58.771 --> 00:37:01.050
<v Speaker 1>hit him with the baton and tied him up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was like,</v>

642
00:37:01.051 --> 00:37:01.884
<v Speaker 1>so she visualized this quite intently </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was pretty damn happy about the </v>

643
00:37:04.681 --> 00:37:05.970
<v Speaker 1>whole visualization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

644
00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:08.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it was because it put her in</v>

645
00:37:08.731 --> 00:37:10.800
<v Speaker 1>the role of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

646
00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:11.903
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>person able to defend herself rather </v>

647
00:37:14.071 --> 00:37:16.410
<v Speaker 1>than in the role of helpless victim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

648
00:37:16.411 --> 00:37:19.710
<v Speaker 1>that was the end of your nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's not actually very uncommon.</v>

649
00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:21.413
<v Speaker 1>I had another client who she was walking</v>
<v Speaker 1>down a beach in her dream and on the </v>

650
00:37:26.851 --> 00:37:27.684
<v Speaker 1>beach above the dunes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was this man who had a big Boa </v>

651
00:37:30.211 --> 00:37:35.211
<v Speaker 1>constrictor and he was showing it to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>crowd and she just walked on by and uh,</v>

652
00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.110
<v Speaker 1>she was facing a variety of very </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult things.</v>

653
00:37:40.111 --> 00:37:40.861
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

654
00:37:40.861 --> 00:37:41.694
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

655
00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:46.000
<v Speaker 1>all those other people were curious </v>
<v Speaker 1>about looking at the snake.</v>

656
00:37:46.001 --> 00:37:48.190
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you could look at the snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>

657
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:49.383
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the person who's handling </v>

658
00:37:50.321 --> 00:37:53.100
<v Speaker 1>the snake is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a charlatan and a phony.</v>

659
00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:55.540
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't want to have anything to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

660
00:37:55.541 --> 00:37:56.680
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

661
00:37:56.681 --> 00:37:58.540
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's play with the dream of bath.</v>

662
00:37:58.570 --> 00:37:59.620
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

663
00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:03.070
<v Speaker 1>she closed her eyes and we went into it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>

664
00:38:03.071 --> 00:38:05.890
<v Speaker 1>now I want you to go up there and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>take,</v>

665
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:07.510
<v Speaker 1>take a look at the snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get closer.</v>

666
00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:08.373
<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid that the crowd will make me </v>

667
00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:11.643
<v Speaker 1>touch the snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's interesting because what that </v>

668
00:38:14.471 --> 00:38:18.790
<v Speaker 1>meant was she was afraid that if she </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with people that she would be</v>

669
00:38:18.791 --> 00:38:23.020
<v Speaker 1>forced by peer pressure to engage in </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that she was afraid of doing.</v>

670
00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:23.883
<v Speaker 1>So she was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was afraid of the crowd and it's </v>

671
00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:26.410
<v Speaker 1>attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

672
00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:30.430
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if people ask you to do that,</v>

673
00:38:30.431 --> 00:38:33.280
<v Speaker 1>you just tell them that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks very much,</v>

674
00:38:33.281 --> 00:38:34.114
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not comfortable with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's enough me to look at the snake and </v>

675
00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:38.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably they'll back off.</v>

676
00:38:38.291 --> 00:38:43.291
<v Speaker 1>And so she did that and they backed off </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then she was watching and this is</v>

677
00:38:43.631 --> 00:38:46.660
<v Speaker 1>an act active imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would call this act of imagination.</v>

678
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:50.870
<v Speaker 1>She was watching the guy handled the </v>
<v Speaker 1>snake and she said you can,</v>

679
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:53.290
<v Speaker 1>because the fantasy was continuing like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a daydream.</v>

680
00:38:53.291 --> 00:38:54.430
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

681
00:38:54.431 --> 00:38:57.130
<v Speaker 1>he's not a charlatan and all he knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to handle these,</v>

682
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:58.023
<v Speaker 1>these snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's out here on the beach to show </v>

683
00:39:00.251 --> 00:39:02.980
<v Speaker 1>other people how to handle snakes </v>
<v Speaker 1>safely.</v>

684
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.350
<v Speaker 1>And he's actually a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

685
00:39:05.351 --> 00:39:07.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty damn interesting because a</v>

686
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:11.020
<v Speaker 1>snake handler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a snake handler is an architectural</v>

687
00:39:11.021 --> 00:39:12.520
<v Speaker 1>Messiah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>

688
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:14.223
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

689
00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:19.590
<v Speaker 1>So I told you those stories back to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

690
00:39:19.591 --> 00:39:21.630
<v Speaker 1>to my little nephew now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright?</v>

691
00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:25.530
<v Speaker 1>So beat things jumping on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

692
00:39:25.531 --> 00:39:26.850
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could you do about that?</v>

693
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.560
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he kind of perked up,</v>

694
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:30.023
<v Speaker 1>which is an interesting postural </v>
<v Speaker 1>adjustment take because he was sort of </v>

695
00:39:32.041 --> 00:39:32.874
<v Speaker 1>like this before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he perked up and his eyes got </v>

696
00:39:34.111 --> 00:39:36.630
<v Speaker 1>kinda bright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's excited about this idea.</v>

697
00:39:36.631 --> 00:39:39.300
<v Speaker 1>And I think that was activation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach systems,</v>

698
00:39:39.301 --> 00:39:40.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather than,</v>

699
00:39:40.141 --> 00:39:40.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

700
00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:44.070
<v Speaker 1>the freezing and retreat systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we sits up,</v>

701
00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.170
<v Speaker 1>his eyes get bright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's excited.</v>

702
00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:47.183
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would take my sort and I would get my </v>

703
00:39:50.191 --> 00:39:51.630
<v Speaker 1>dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

704
00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:53.610
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm missing one key element.</v>

705
00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:57.030
<v Speaker 1>After he told us about the beat</v>

706
00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:03.220
<v Speaker 1>monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said there's a dragon behind them and</v>

707
00:40:03.221 --> 00:40:06.100
<v Speaker 1>the dragon is puffing out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke and fire.</v>

708
00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:08.110
<v Speaker 1>And every time it pops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>puffs out,</v>

709
00:40:08.111 --> 00:40:12.430
<v Speaker 1>smoke and fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the smoke turns into the beaked dwarfs.</v>

710
00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:14.380
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a big problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

711
00:40:14.381 --> 00:40:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Because you got all these big dwarfs </v>
<v Speaker 1>around and you're gonna be fighting them</v>

712
00:40:17.981 --> 00:40:18.814
<v Speaker 1>off hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's an infinite supply of beak </v>

713
00:40:21.071 --> 00:40:21.904
<v Speaker 1>dwarfs because there's a dragon behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>it that is like puffing up all the beat </v>

714
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.863
<v Speaker 1>big door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what the hell are you going to do </v>

715
00:40:26.621 --> 00:40:27.454
<v Speaker 1>about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I knew that that was like a hydro </v>

716
00:40:29.591 --> 00:40:31.240
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an old story.</v>

717
00:40:31.241 --> 00:40:36.190
<v Speaker 1>A Hydra is this multi-headed snake and </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you cut off one head,</v>

718
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:40.180
<v Speaker 1>seven more heads grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's a problem.</v>

719
00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:41.553
<v Speaker 1>It's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently you're supposed to drop a </v>

720
00:40:43.121 --> 00:40:43.954
<v Speaker 1>very large rock on hydro because cutting</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heads off it isn't going to be </v>

721
00:40:46.961 --> 00:40:47.380
<v Speaker 1>helpful.</v>

722
00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:48.400
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

723
00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:52.610
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't take a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination to notice that.</v>

724
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:56.530
<v Speaker 1>What that story means is that sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you solve a problem,</v>

725
00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:59.140
<v Speaker 1>you bring on seven more problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

726
00:40:59.141 --> 00:40:59.974
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually life because very </v>
<v Speaker 1>few things that we provide solutions to </v>

727
00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:07.870
<v Speaker 1>don't generate a host of new problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

728
00:41:07.871 --> 00:41:10.330
<v Speaker 1>like the car is a really good example of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

729
00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:12.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we like to think that the car is</v>

730
00:41:12.591 --> 00:41:14.830
<v Speaker 1>the thing to get from one place to </v>
<v Speaker 1>another end.</v>

731
00:41:14.831 --> 00:41:16.960
<v Speaker 1>But it could turn out that what a car </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually is,</v>

732
00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:18.093
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an entity that transformed cities and </v>

733
00:41:20.681 --> 00:41:22.330
<v Speaker 1>also the atmosphere,</v>

734
00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:25.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

735
00:41:25.351 --> 00:41:28.440
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it's the assembly line that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not just an assembly line.</v>

736
00:41:28.441 --> 00:41:29.274
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this assembly line is the thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that transformed cities by making cars </v>

737
00:41:32.581 --> 00:41:35.360
<v Speaker 1>and also fills the atmosphere with </v>
<v Speaker 1>carbon dioxide.</v>

738
00:41:35.361 --> 00:41:36.800
<v Speaker 1>And then we all die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

739
00:41:36.801 --> 00:41:40.070
<v Speaker 1>That's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at least hypothetically,</v>

740
00:41:40.071 --> 00:41:42.480
<v Speaker 1>it's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

741
00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:45.683
<v Speaker 1>So it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always the case in life that when </v>

742
00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:48.104
<v Speaker 1>you move forward in one direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even if you solve a problem that </v>

743
00:41:50.421 --> 00:41:55.421
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean you solved the problem of </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems and that the best solution to a</v>

744
00:41:56.661 --> 00:41:57.494
<v Speaker 1>problem isn't the solution to a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best solution to a problem is the </v>

745
00:42:01.131 --> 00:42:04.490
<v Speaker 1>solution to the problem of problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

746
00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:05.713
<v Speaker 1>It's a category how best to face the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world if the world is composed of </v>

747
00:42:08.901 --> 00:42:11.060
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

748
00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.390
<v Speaker 1>so here's this dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

749
00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.830
<v Speaker 1>that's when I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could you do about that?</v>

750
00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:17.143
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

751
00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:18.153
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would take my sword and I'd go get my </v>

752
00:42:19.311 --> 00:42:21.890
<v Speaker 1>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I go jump on the dragon's head.</v>

753
00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:23.113
<v Speaker 1>And then I poked both of the sides out </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the sword and then I'd go right </v>

754
00:42:25.581 --> 00:42:26.414
<v Speaker 1>down its throat to where the firebox was</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'd cut off a piece of the firebox </v>

755
00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:32.510
<v Speaker 1>and I'd make a shield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

756
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:33.703
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

757
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:35.870
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

758
00:42:35.871 --> 00:42:40.130
<v Speaker 1>Because what he did was so perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

759
00:42:40.131 --> 00:42:41.780
<v Speaker 1>I went right to the source of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

760
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:43.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right to the heart of the matter,</v>

761
00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:46.310
<v Speaker 1>right down the dragons throat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

762
00:42:46.311 --> 00:42:47.144
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the best part about it was </v>

763
00:42:48.681 --> 00:42:49.514
<v Speaker 1>though that was that he cut a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the firebox off so that he could use </v>

764
00:42:52.041 --> 00:42:54.620
<v Speaker 1>that as a shield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so brilliant.</v>

765
00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:58.880
<v Speaker 1>And the reason it's brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's brilliant on multiple levels,</v>

766
00:42:58.881 --> 00:42:59.714
<v Speaker 1>but the first reason it's brilliant and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most important one is that it is </v>

767
00:43:02.721 --> 00:43:06.290
<v Speaker 1>possible that if you confront a dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you will obtain a shield.</v>

768
00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:08.900
<v Speaker 1>And that that's like the story of </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity,</v>

769
00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:11.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we face down our predators,</v>

770
00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:14.420
<v Speaker 1>if we confront the unknown instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>running away,</v>

771
00:43:14.421 --> 00:43:15.254
<v Speaker 1>if we explore and voluntarily it turns </v>
<v Speaker 1>out that every time we encounter a </v>

772
00:43:19.551 --> 00:43:20.384
<v Speaker 1>problem we can extract out a solution </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that solution might be a solution </v>

773
00:43:23.931 --> 00:43:27.350
<v Speaker 1>for all sorts of things rather than just</v>
<v Speaker 1>a solution for that problem.</v>

774
00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:30.980
<v Speaker 1>And so we've had to learn that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem is,</v>

775
00:43:30.981 --> 00:43:31.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

776
00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:34.700
<v Speaker 1>is also the place that generates </v>
<v Speaker 1>solutions.</v>

777
00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:37.490
<v Speaker 1>So there's nothing more informative than</v>
<v Speaker 1>a problem.</v>

778
00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:39.590
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem is that a problem might </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill you.</v>

779
00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:40.663
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so it's not like we have been able </v>

780
00:43:44.091 --> 00:43:44.924
<v Speaker 1>to make the problem disappeared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we've come up with a pretty damn </v>

781
00:43:47.091 --> 00:43:47.924
<v Speaker 1>good way of dealing with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like confront the damn problem and </v>

782
00:43:50.391 --> 00:43:52.790
<v Speaker 1>figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what do we do?</v>

783
00:43:52.791 --> 00:43:54.050
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we do?</v>

784
00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:56.630
<v Speaker 1>Then from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we extracting?</v>

785
00:43:57.590 --> 00:43:58.423
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he extracted out a shield and of course </v>

786
00:43:59.541 --> 00:44:00.374
<v Speaker 1>that would protect them from the fire </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was made out of the firebox </v>

787
00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:06.230
<v Speaker 1>like good work kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we confront a problem,</v>

788
00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:11.720
<v Speaker 1>what we extract out his information and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we use the information,</v>

789
00:44:11.721 --> 00:44:15.620
<v Speaker 1>we use the information we build with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we learn new things about it,</v>

790
00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:19.850
<v Speaker 1>and so you can conceive of a problem as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a place of information.</v>

791
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Now it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more,</v>

792
00:44:21.261 --> 00:44:22.700
<v Speaker 1>it's worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's worse than that.</v>

793
00:44:22.701 --> 00:44:23.534
<v Speaker 1>If that's not sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualization because it's a place </v>

794
00:44:26.511 --> 00:44:29.670
<v Speaker 1>of information that has this nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you,</v>

795
00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:30.523
<v Speaker 1>you can't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just turn it into an abstract </v>

796
00:44:32.281 --> 00:44:33.114
<v Speaker 1>issue because the place of information </v>
<v Speaker 1>is also the place of horrible predatory </v>

797
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.100
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spirit,</v>

798
00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:39.470
<v Speaker 1>reptile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

799
00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:44.530
<v Speaker 1>it's all tangled together in one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We use the systems that we've evolved to</v>

800
00:44:50.111 --> 00:44:54.640
<v Speaker 1>identify rapidly identify predatory </v>
<v Speaker 1>reptiles,</v>

801
00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:55.773
<v Speaker 1>but predators of all sorts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but predatory reptiles for the point of </v>

802
00:44:58.031 --> 00:45:02.740
<v Speaker 1>this argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once we became capable of abstraction,</v>

803
00:45:02.741 --> 00:45:06.820
<v Speaker 1>we use the same damn system to represent</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

804
00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.200
<v Speaker 1>Abstract problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

805
00:45:10.201 --> 00:45:13.170
<v Speaker 1>because we know how evolution works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a conservative business.</v>

806
00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:14.213
<v Speaker 1>Once you lay the platform for one kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of perception or cognition and then you </v>

807
00:45:18.451 --> 00:45:19.780
<v Speaker 1>transform that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

808
00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:22.340
<v Speaker 1>you increase its power and generalized </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability.</v>

809
00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:24.900
<v Speaker 1>You have to build it on the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>platform.</v>

810
00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:26.273
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like that continuous generation of </v>

811
00:45:28.141 --> 00:45:32.040
<v Speaker 1>new versions of windows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've already got the infrastructure in</v>

812
00:45:32.041 --> 00:45:32.874
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just demolish everything </v>

813
00:45:34.261 --> 00:45:36.460
<v Speaker 1>completely and build it from scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

814
00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:41.480
<v Speaker 1>we have the same body plan as reptiles </v>
<v Speaker 1>and mammals and birds and whales and not</v>

815
00:45:43.411 --> 00:45:44.520
<v Speaker 1>fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

816
00:45:44.521 --> 00:45:45.354
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty wide range of things </v>

817
00:45:47.431 --> 00:45:49.590
<v Speaker 1>that basically have the same skeleton we</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

818
00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:52.230
<v Speaker 1>So evolution is a very conservative </v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

819
00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:58.160
<v Speaker 1>Now my nephew intuited that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>confronted the heart of the problem,</v>

820
00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:00.303
<v Speaker 1>you could extract out something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would protect you from the problem </v>

821
00:46:03.821 --> 00:46:05.980
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what human beings do,</v>

822
00:46:05.981 --> 00:46:07.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're always on the frontier.</v>

823
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Some of us are on the frontier</v>

824
00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:15.970
<v Speaker 1>and the front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always a frontier.</v>

825
00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:17.033
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we conceptualize the frontier as the </v>

826
00:46:19.181 --> 00:46:20.014
<v Speaker 1>place where our knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there are journals called </v>

827
00:46:24.011 --> 00:46:29.011
<v Speaker 1>frontiers of neurology and we also think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that as the cutting edge.</v>

828
00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:31.593
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's well,</v>

829
00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:33.550
<v Speaker 1>what's it cutting into?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

830
00:46:33.551 --> 00:46:36.430
<v Speaker 1>it's cutting into a mat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

831
00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:37.603
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of a variant of Plato's idea </v>

832
00:46:39.071 --> 00:46:39.904
<v Speaker 1>that you cut nature at the joints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a knife like element to it as </v>

833
00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:45.803
<v Speaker 1>well in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's partly because of course you </v>

834
00:46:46.781 --> 00:46:49.900
<v Speaker 1>do use a knife to cut things up so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can figure out what they are.</v>

835
00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:50.341
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

836
00:46:50.341 --> 00:46:51.174
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the symbols are as grounded in </v>

837
00:46:52.721 --> 00:46:56.110
<v Speaker 1>reality as they can possibly be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not as young pointed out,</v>

838
00:46:56.111 --> 00:46:58.000
<v Speaker 1>the symbols aren't trying to make things</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>

839
00:46:58.300 --> 00:46:59.133
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to make things we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand easy and the so the symbol </v>

840
00:47:02.381 --> 00:47:06.700
<v Speaker 1>stands when you get out to the frontier </v>
<v Speaker 1>is all you've got when you look past the</v>

841
00:47:06.701 --> 00:47:07.534
<v Speaker 1>frontiers into the abyss is the symbol </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the symbol is created by the parts </v>

842
00:47:12.251 --> 00:47:13.084
<v Speaker 1>of your mind that are capable of sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>groping blindly in the darkness and </v>

843
00:47:16.571 --> 00:47:17.404
<v Speaker 1>formulating monstrous representations of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what might be there as first pass </v>

844
00:47:21.791 --> 00:47:25.780
<v Speaker 1>approximations of what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then of course you.</v>

845
00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:26.763
<v Speaker 1>You refine that and you refine that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you refine that and at some point gets </v>

846
00:47:29.321 --> 00:47:30.154
<v Speaker 1>so refined that you can articulate it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can lay it down in a </v>

847
00:47:32.681 --> 00:47:34.810
<v Speaker 1>mathematical theory and you can control </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

848
00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:37.330
<v Speaker 1>But to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starts like that.</v>

849
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:39.303
<v Speaker 1>It starts like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there is a matter of spirit element </v>

850
00:47:44.201 --> 00:47:46.150
<v Speaker 1>here and there's an informational </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements,</v>

851
00:47:46.151 --> 00:47:51.151
<v Speaker 1>so I think the best way to approach that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to think about it from a p,</v>

852
00:47:51.341 --> 00:47:56.341
<v Speaker 1>a jetty and perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Piaget was a constructivist,</v>

853
00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:59.360
<v Speaker 1>so this is how he thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Children learn things.</v>

854
00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:05.930
<v Speaker 1>They would run through a routine that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've mastered.</v>

855
00:48:05.931 --> 00:48:07.880
<v Speaker 1>They started out with just basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflexes,</v>

856
00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:09.950
<v Speaker 1>so there were things they could do as </v>
<v Speaker 1>soon as they're born.</v>

857
00:48:09.951 --> 00:48:10.940
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can,</v>

858
00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:11.803
<v Speaker 1>they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can take in milk and that also </v>

859
00:48:13.521 --> 00:48:14.354
<v Speaker 1>helps them establish an initial </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with the mother and their </v>

860
00:48:18.201 --> 00:48:19.034
<v Speaker 1>eyes are roughly focused in so far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're focused at all about the same </v>

861
00:48:23.061 --> 00:48:26.240
<v Speaker 1>distance that the mother's face would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>from their eyes if they're breastfeeding</v>

862
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.823
<v Speaker 1>and they're capable of some movements </v>
<v Speaker 1>and their tongue in their mouth or </v>

863
00:48:29.631 --> 00:48:34.190
<v Speaker 1>pretty wired up and they get control </v>
<v Speaker 1>over their eyes relatively quickly.</v>

864
00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:36.283
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they start to experiment with </v>

865
00:48:37.731 --> 00:48:38.780
<v Speaker 1>these reflexes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

866
00:48:38.781 --> 00:48:40.840
<v Speaker 1>they can kind of fling their arms around</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're,</v>

867
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:41.703
<v Speaker 1>they myelinate from the center outward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they start out on differentiated </v>

868
00:48:44.781 --> 00:48:45.614
<v Speaker 1>basically and then they differentiate </v>
<v Speaker 1>outward and become more and more </v>

869
00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:50.090
<v Speaker 1>articulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>articulated,</v>

870
00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:51.823
<v Speaker 1>and they learn to experiment with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>basic reflexes and modify them and you </v>

871
00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:56.360
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

872
00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:57.390
<v Speaker 1>think about when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

873
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:59.810
<v Speaker 1>when you're first learning to dance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of clunk around,</v>

874
00:48:59.811 --> 00:49:00.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lose,</v>

875
00:49:00.741 --> 00:49:04.670
<v Speaker 1>you use low resolution movements and </v>
<v Speaker 1>those are often by the way,</v>

876
00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:06.530
<v Speaker 1>controlled more by your right </v>
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere.</v>

877
00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Once they become high resolution and an </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely skilled movements,</v>

878
00:49:10.101 --> 00:49:12.380
<v Speaker 1>they start to be more controlled by your</v>
<v Speaker 1>left hemisphere.</v>

879
00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:15.440
<v Speaker 1>So you started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sort of start out like Frankenstein,</v>

880
00:49:15.830 --> 00:49:17.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you end up like Nuria have,</v>

881
00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:19.340
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're fortunate.</v>

882
00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:22.820
<v Speaker 1>So although you probably don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably stay more like Frankenstein</v>

883
00:49:22.821 --> 00:49:24.470
<v Speaker 1>or at least I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

884
00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:27.743
<v Speaker 1>now what Piaget pointed out was that now</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to remember that piaget was </v>

885
00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:35.400
<v Speaker 1>mostly interested in figuring out how </v>
<v Speaker 1>people figured out things.</v>

886
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:38.430
<v Speaker 1>That was his primary goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And underneath that,</v>

887
00:49:38.431 --> 00:49:39.264
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the goal of uniting science with </v>

888
00:49:40.561 --> 00:49:41.394
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something that hardly anybody </v>

889
00:49:42.331 --> 00:49:43.164
<v Speaker 1>knows about piaget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he stated it bluntly and actually </v>

890
00:49:47.461 --> 00:49:48.294
<v Speaker 1>wrote a novel about it anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he was curious about how people </v>

891
00:49:51.031 --> 00:49:56.031
<v Speaker 1>figured out things and so his notion was</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a child would be lumping along with</v>

892
00:49:56.101 --> 00:49:56.934
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of low resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychomotor Schema and it would do </v>

893
00:50:01.381 --> 00:50:03.090
<v Speaker 1>something that it didn't expect.</v>

894
00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:04.133
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

895
00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:09.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many of you are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar with babies,</v>

896
00:50:09.171 --> 00:50:11.110
<v Speaker 1>but they have a remarkable startle </v>
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>

897
00:50:11.111 --> 00:50:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Say so if you have a relatively new baby</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you blow on it,</v>

898
00:50:13.881 --> 00:50:15.200
<v Speaker 1>it just goes like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

899
00:50:15.201 --> 00:50:16.520
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really amazing.</v>

900
00:50:16.521 --> 00:50:19.370
<v Speaker 1>And it as a full body startle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

901
00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:21.763
<v Speaker 1>it's quite cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're very capable of being </v>

902
00:50:25.011 --> 00:50:26.600
<v Speaker 1>surprised by things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

903
00:50:26.601 --> 00:50:27.434
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe laying in their crib and they're </v>

904
00:50:28.221 --> 00:50:30.200
<v Speaker 1>looking at a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mobile up there.</v>

905
00:50:30.201 --> 00:50:31.970
<v Speaker 1>If you buy your child immobile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

906
00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:37.160
<v Speaker 1>it should be black and white and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't hang the damn things this way.</v>

907
00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the child actually is gonna.</v>

908
00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.350
<v Speaker 1>He's looking up so people by their </v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

909
00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:44.930
<v Speaker 1>mobiles all the time and from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>child's perspective,</v>

910
00:50:44.931 --> 00:50:47.240
<v Speaker 1>they just looked like lines hanging in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the air.</v>

911
00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:47.961
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

912
00:50:47.961 --> 00:50:49.640
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're supposed to be facing down,</v>

913
00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:51.470
<v Speaker 1>so keep that in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

914
00:50:51.471 --> 00:50:53.390
<v Speaker 1>the baby's lying in the crib,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

915
00:50:53.391 --> 00:50:57.280
<v Speaker 1>and it's looking at things and sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving around in like,</v>

916
00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:00.470
<v Speaker 1>like this because it hasn't got great </v>
<v Speaker 1>control of itself.</v>

917
00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:08.660
<v Speaker 1>Sorry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it wax the mobile,</v>

918
00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:14.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's pretty,</v>

919
00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:16.880
<v Speaker 1>it goes wax the mobile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes like this.</v>

920
00:51:16.881 --> 00:51:17.714
<v Speaker 1>It's like that was not what it expected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then from Piaget's perspective what </v>

921
00:51:22.791 --> 00:51:27.791
<v Speaker 1>would happen is the job would try to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that again because it was interesting.</v>

922
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:42.670
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense the first interaction </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the mobile was quasi random,</v>

923
00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:45.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it doesn't really know what it's</v>

924
00:51:45.471 --> 00:51:48.890
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then maybe it's foot kick the mobile</v>

925
00:51:48.891 --> 00:51:52.160
<v Speaker 1>and something interesting happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the child tries to see if it can</v>

926
00:51:52.161 --> 00:51:56.330
<v Speaker 1>organize itself to give that thing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kick again and then maybe it'll practice</v>

927
00:51:56.331 --> 00:51:56.751
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

928
00:51:56.751 --> 00:51:57.650
<v Speaker 1>what kids are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

929
00:51:57.651 --> 00:51:59.690
<v Speaker 1>they will obsessively practice </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

930
00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:03.260
<v Speaker 1>So when my daughter was young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably 18 months old,</v>

931
00:52:03.261 --> 00:52:06.350
<v Speaker 1>we gave her these Disney books and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

932
00:52:06.570 --> 00:52:09.920
<v Speaker 1>were hard back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were only about this big and maybe</v>

933
00:52:09.921 --> 00:52:13.160
<v Speaker 1>10 pages and there was like five of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fit in the little box.</v>

934
00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:14.383
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turned out not to be so easy to put </v>

935
00:52:15.351 --> 00:52:17.900
<v Speaker 1>them in the box and so she probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>spent,</v>

936
00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:19.813
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 hours picking up a little hard cover </v>

937
00:52:24.351 --> 00:52:25.184
<v Speaker 1>thing and putting it in the box and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>picking up another and getting them all </v>

938
00:52:28.041 --> 00:52:31.220
<v Speaker 1>in and then shake them all out and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>she'd do it again and you might think,</v>

939
00:52:31.221 --> 00:52:32.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was she doing?</v>

940
00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was sharpening up her putting things</v>

941
00:52:35.301 --> 00:52:36.134
<v Speaker 1>into things ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a pretty good ability because </v>

942
00:52:38.211 --> 00:52:39.044
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be doing a lot of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout your entire life and so by </v>

943
00:52:41.721 --> 00:52:44.180
<v Speaker 1>practicing that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how she built up that,</v>

944
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:48.320
<v Speaker 1>that particular subset of transferable </v>
<v Speaker 1>skills.</v>

945
00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then you might think,</v>

946
00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:58.300
<v Speaker 1>well exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was that box of books for her?</v>

947
00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:01.930
<v Speaker 1>How would you conceptualize it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

948
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:03.070
<v Speaker 1>because if you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

949
00:53:03.071 --> 00:53:04.480
<v Speaker 1>well that's a box of books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

950
00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:05.343
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

951
00:53:06.310 --> 00:53:11.260
<v Speaker 1>It's a box of books for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for her it was something else.</v>

952
00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:12.393
<v Speaker 1>It was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a phenomena that enabled her to </v>

953
00:53:16.151 --> 00:53:21.151
<v Speaker 1>extract out information about how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>organize her motor activity and so,</v>

954
00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:23.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then I could say,</v>

955
00:53:23.981 --> 00:53:26.940
<v Speaker 1>well to the degree you think it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

956
00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:28.873
<v Speaker 1>a box of books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just blinded by your own </v>

957
00:53:30.841 --> 00:53:34.260
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was far more than that for her.</v>

958
00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:36.810
<v Speaker 1>And it's quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see this with kids all the time,</v>

959
00:53:36.811 --> 00:53:37.644
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you buy them,</v>

960
00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:41.770
<v Speaker 1>you buy them a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a toy for one purpose,</v>

961
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:42.743
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you buy them a big toy and then they </v>

962
00:53:43.331 --> 00:53:45.670
<v Speaker 1>play in the box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

963
00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:48.053
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it was interesting when we had </v>

964
00:53:49.831 --> 00:53:52.770
<v Speaker 1>little kids because they would go around</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they do weird things with things all</v>

965
00:53:52.771 --> 00:53:53.604
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we got milk and milk bottles at that </v>

966
00:53:55.471 --> 00:53:56.304
<v Speaker 1>point in the milk bottles had these like</v>
<v Speaker 1>foil wrappers on them and my daughter </v>

967
00:53:59.281 --> 00:54:04.281
<v Speaker 1>would always use those as sons in her </v>
<v Speaker 1>little house drawings and show she'd be.</v>

968
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:05.543
<v Speaker 1>She'd walk around and take things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd already categorized as a certain </v>

969
00:54:09.001 --> 00:54:11.970
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing and she'd do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely different with it.</v>

970
00:54:11.971 --> 00:54:12.804
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's in part lack of latent </v>

971
00:54:14.071 --> 00:54:14.904
<v Speaker 1>inhibition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that she hadn't categorized </v>

972
00:54:16.621 --> 00:54:17.454
<v Speaker 1>that thing meant that it was polyvalent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is many things that you could do </v>

973
00:54:20.551 --> 00:54:23.850
<v Speaker 1>with it instead of the thing that you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you categorize it.</v>

974
00:54:24.330 --> 00:54:25.163
<v Speaker 1>So Piaget basically conceptualized the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unexpected event as a source of new to </v>

975
00:54:34.881 --> 00:54:35.714
<v Speaker 1>things as a source of new matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking and as a source of new </v>

976
00:54:40.671 --> 00:54:42.770
<v Speaker 1>spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking,</v>

977
00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:44.233
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

978
00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:47.221
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

979
00:54:47.221 --> 00:54:50.760
<v Speaker 1>the novel thing would attract your </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention and then second,</v>

980
00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:51.893
<v Speaker 1>as you're interacting with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing two things just like </v>

981
00:54:54.211 --> 00:54:56.880
<v Speaker 1>Marduk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this little baby in the crib.</v>

982
00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:00.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like by whacking the things with </v>
<v Speaker 1>his hands,</v>

983
00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:01.583
<v Speaker 1>it starts to conceptualize their </v>
<v Speaker 1>function as a defined and categorized </v>

984
00:55:06.691 --> 00:55:07.860
<v Speaker 1>entity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

985
00:55:07.861 --> 00:55:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Because you get a sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

986
00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:11.520
<v Speaker 1>imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine this,</v>

987
00:55:11.650 --> 00:55:12.483
<v Speaker 1>like let's say your eyes are closed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a basketball and there's a </v>

988
00:55:15.631 --> 00:55:16.464
<v Speaker 1>pillar in a room and you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what's in the room and all </v>

989
00:55:20.401 --> 00:55:22.680
<v Speaker 1>you can use as the basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can move around.</v>

990
00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:23.663
<v Speaker 1>You could bounce the basketball off that</v>
<v Speaker 1>pillar a lot and sooner or later you </v>

991
00:55:26.591 --> 00:55:28.380
<v Speaker 1>develop a visual image of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

992
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:31.320
<v Speaker 1>It's a low resolution investigative </v>
<v Speaker 1>tool,</v>

993
00:55:31.490 --> 00:55:32.323
<v Speaker 1>a basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could still use it if you're </v>

994
00:55:34.501 --> 00:55:36.150
<v Speaker 1>bouncing off it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

995
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:40.470
<v Speaker 1>You can build up a representation of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so from the Piagetian perspective,</v>

996
00:55:40.471 --> 00:55:43.560
<v Speaker 1>that's how a child builds up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of the world.</v>

997
00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:47.760
<v Speaker 1>That's how it creates the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It creates the material world for itself</v>

998
00:55:47.761 --> 00:55:49.500
<v Speaker 1>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by banging up against it.</v>

999
00:55:49.730 --> 00:55:51.960
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at the same time,</v>

1000
00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:56.370
<v Speaker 1>it's learning how to bang up against it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in ever better ways.</v>

1001
00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:57.713
<v Speaker 1>So the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the thing that attracts the </v>

1002
00:55:59.491 --> 00:56:02.070
<v Speaker 1>child's attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be best conceptual.</v>

1003
00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Imagine this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's another.</v>

1004
00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:08.580
<v Speaker 1>So the child is surprised by a mobile </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it kicks.</v>

1005
00:56:08.581 --> 00:56:11.040
<v Speaker 1>The child is surprised when it drops a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1006
00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:12.373
<v Speaker 1>a clump of baby food on the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The child is surprised when a glass of </v>

1007
00:56:16.921 --> 00:56:17.754
<v Speaker 1>water tilts over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Charlie's surprised when he pulls </v>

1008
00:56:20.071 --> 00:56:22.380
<v Speaker 1>the dog's tail on the dog barks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1009
00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:24.430
<v Speaker 1>the child surprised all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1010
00:56:24.431 --> 00:56:25.264
<v Speaker 1>so then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the similarity between all of </v>

1011
00:56:28.331 --> 00:56:29.500
<v Speaker 1>those surprising events?</v>

1012
00:56:29.650 --> 00:56:33.400
<v Speaker 1>If you had to categorize the category of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all surprising events,</v>

1013
00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:37.030
<v Speaker 1>what would that category look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1014
00:56:37.031 --> 00:56:38.010
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's,</v>

1015
00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:40.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not an appropriate category.</v>

1016
00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:41.291
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1017
00:56:41.291 --> 00:56:42.124
<v Speaker 1>it's not clear that that's not an </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate category because the </v>

1018
00:56:44.471 --> 00:56:45.304
<v Speaker 1>category of all surprising events is </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the category of the unknown as </v>

1019
00:56:49.091 --> 00:56:51.880
<v Speaker 1>such.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as I said before,</v>

1020
00:56:51.881 --> 00:56:55.210
<v Speaker 1>it's better to know how to deal with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown as such,</v>

1021
00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:57.100
<v Speaker 1>then it is to deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know,</v>

1022
00:56:57.130 --> 00:56:59.290
<v Speaker 1>to deal with specific aspects of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>

1023
00:56:59.291 --> 00:57:02.530
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what was expressed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my nephew's dream,</v>

1024
00:57:02.531 --> 00:57:03.364
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't going to fight off the little </v>

1025
00:57:04.571 --> 00:57:06.100
<v Speaker 1>doors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no point in it.</v>

1026
00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:11.620
<v Speaker 1>He had to go to the thing that was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>source of the trouble and fight that.</v>

1027
00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:14.080
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how people are.</v>

1028
00:57:15.370 --> 00:57:19.060
<v Speaker 1>That's what our most archetipal stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>are about.</v>

1029
00:57:19.061 --> 00:57:21.790
<v Speaker 1>So some of you are star trek fans </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps.</v>

1030
00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:25.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the motto of Star Trek?</v>

1031
00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:29.140
<v Speaker 1>It's to boldly go where no one has gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

1032
00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:31.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's pretty happy about that,</v>

1033
00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:32.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's very,</v>

1034
00:57:32.681 --> 00:57:33.514
<v Speaker 1>very basic archetipal story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it does encapsulate the human </v>

1035
00:57:37.541 --> 00:57:39.720
<v Speaker 1>relationship with reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

1036
00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:40.450
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1037
00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:45.040
<v Speaker 1>we think of reality that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think of the known and unknown and we</v>

1038
00:57:45.041 --> 00:57:45.874
<v Speaker 1>think of there being a boundary between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the known and the unknown and we think </v>

1039
00:57:48.041 --> 00:57:52.590
<v Speaker 1>about being on the edge of that boundary</v>
<v Speaker 1>and looking over and that's the,</v>

1040
00:57:52.650 --> 00:57:55.090
<v Speaker 1>that's the architect of exploratory </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

1041
00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:56.223
<v Speaker 1>Now the serpent symbol is even deeper </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that because the serpent symbol </v>

1042
00:57:59.381 --> 00:58:02.860
<v Speaker 1>represents the world before it's even </v>
<v Speaker 1>been categorized.</v>

1043
00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:05.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like what's there when there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>one there.</v>

1044
00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:09.880
<v Speaker 1>That's what this symbol represents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the ultimate in the unknown.</v>

1045
00:58:09.881 --> 00:58:10.714
<v Speaker 1>It's the source of all things and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's infinite and self contained and </v>

1046
00:58:14.651 --> 00:58:16.640
<v Speaker 1>it's matter and spirit at the same time.</v>

1047
00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:17.473
<v Speaker 1>And partly it's infinite because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>never run out of an unknown things and </v>

1048
00:58:21.431 --> 00:58:22.264
<v Speaker 1>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's eternal because you never run out </v>

1049
00:58:25.181 --> 00:58:26.260
<v Speaker 1>of unknown things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1050
00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:29.260
<v Speaker 1>and it's mattered because when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with it,</v>

1051
00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:31.510
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you conjure up the material world,</v>

1052
00:58:31.511 --> 00:58:33.580
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all sorts of different ways.</v>

1053
00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:34.653
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes by actually crafting material </v>

1054
00:58:36.461 --> 00:58:37.294
<v Speaker 1>things and other times by merely </v>
<v Speaker 1>defining the material of the space that </v>

1055
00:58:41.231 --> 00:58:42.064
<v Speaker 1>you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also extract information out of </v>

1056
00:58:43.781 --> 00:58:46.960
<v Speaker 1>it to build yourself out of because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might say,</v>

1057
00:58:46.961 --> 00:58:48.160
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do you come from?</v>

1058
00:58:48.161 --> 00:58:49.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of it is there you are,</v>

1059
00:58:49.811 --> 00:58:53.560
<v Speaker 1>you have a biological structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But obviously we think of nurture.</v>

1060
00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:56.620
<v Speaker 1>You're extracting information from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment all the time.</v>

1061
00:58:57.220 --> 00:58:59.590
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how do you do that?</v>

1062
00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:02.410
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a variety of ways.</v>

1063
00:59:02.411 --> 00:59:03.101
<v Speaker 1>One is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1064
00:59:03.101 --> 00:59:07.750
<v Speaker 1>Piaget would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you mimic the world with your motor</v>

1065
00:59:07.751 --> 00:59:09.260
<v Speaker 1>apparatus apparatus.</v>

1066
00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>

1067
00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:13.750
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at the can,</v>

1068
00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:17.980
<v Speaker 1>this is part of looking at the can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the can is a graspable object.</v>

1069
00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:20.080
<v Speaker 1>That's the can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how you define it.</v>

1070
00:59:20.081 --> 00:59:20.914
<v Speaker 1>So this is like the can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a pattern in so far as </v>

1071
00:59:25.431 --> 00:59:26.264
<v Speaker 1>it's stable in space across time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a pattern and you can match that </v>

1072
00:59:30.321 --> 00:59:31.154
<v Speaker 1>pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a transfer of the pattern </v>

1073
00:59:33.381 --> 00:59:36.650
<v Speaker 1>here to a transfer to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the pattern here.</v>

1074
00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:39.050
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the use of information.</v>

1075
00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:42.480
<v Speaker 1>Information is information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1076
00:59:42.610 --> 00:59:43.730
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something,</v>

1077
00:59:43.731 --> 00:59:46.160
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of different definitions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>information by the way,</v>

1078
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:47.263
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the information that we think of as </v>

1079
00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:54.020
<v Speaker 1>information is that that you can gather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can then use,</v>

1080
00:59:54.021 --> 00:59:56.270
<v Speaker 1>you incorporate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it's in you,</v>

1081
00:59:56.271 --> 00:59:57.104
<v Speaker 1>and then you can use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in so far as you're constantly </v>

1082
00:59:59.481 --> 01:00:02.330
<v Speaker 1>adjusting to the external world and its </v>
<v Speaker 1>demands,</v>

1083
01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:03.433
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're reproducing the pattern of the </v>

1084
01:00:05.211 --> 01:00:06.770
<v Speaker 1>external world in your body.</v>

1085
01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:10.040
<v Speaker 1>That's one form of representation that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1086
01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:11.053
<v Speaker 1>that's an informed representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you abstract out of that to </v>

1087
01:00:13.731 --> 01:00:14.564
<v Speaker 1>make your abstract representations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point is you're pulling the </v>

1088
01:00:16.791 --> 01:00:20.270
<v Speaker 1>information out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the unknown is the ultimate source of</v>

1089
01:00:20.271 --> 01:00:24.290
<v Speaker 1>information and it can be very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous,</v>

1090
01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:26.870
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter because it's less </v>
<v Speaker 1>he.</v>

1091
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:31.990
<v Speaker 1>The human supposition is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown is there and it's dangerous,</v>

1092
01:00:32.001 --> 01:00:34.880
<v Speaker 1>but the best thing you can do with it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>confronted voluntarily.</v>

1093
01:00:34.881 --> 01:00:37.460
<v Speaker 1>When it makes itself manifest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're prepared,</v>

1094
01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:41.600
<v Speaker 1>that's your best bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

1095
01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:45.350
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's our archetype.</v>

1096
01:00:45.351 --> 01:00:47.990
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's our bat on reality.</v>

1097
01:00:48.590 --> 01:00:49.423
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary biologists say that we </v>

1098
01:00:51.261 --> 01:00:56.261
<v Speaker 1>occupied the cognitive niche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1099
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:13.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

1100
01:01:13.741 --> 01:01:16.530
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what this next bit is about.</v>

1101
01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:19.680
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your question is perfectly timed.</v>

1102
01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:21.533
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now I want to show you this image </v>

1103
01:01:24.481 --> 01:01:27.120
<v Speaker 1>that I forgot to put it in here.</v>

1104
01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:34.033
<v Speaker 3>There we go.</v>

1105
01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:10.973
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to walk you through this </v>

1106
01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:17.240
<v Speaker 1>diagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the middle is an anomaly.</v>

1107
01:02:17.370 --> 01:02:18.930
<v Speaker 1>Now I want to tell you a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1108
01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>So normally it's the unexpected that </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerges when you're,</v>

1109
01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:25.260
<v Speaker 1>when you're laying down a routine on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

1110
01:02:25.290 --> 01:02:25.990
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1111
01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:28.230
<v Speaker 1>you want the world to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does something else.</v>

1112
01:02:28.231 --> 01:02:31.680
<v Speaker 1>We talked about that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it do that something else?</v>

1113
01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.620
<v Speaker 1>Here's a way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1114
01:02:41.110 --> 01:02:41.943
<v Speaker 1>the word phenomenon phenomenon comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a Greek word famous thigh and that </v>

1115
01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:47.673
<v Speaker 1>word means to shine forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when the normally is something that </v>

1116
01:02:51.791 --> 01:02:55.210
<v Speaker 1>shines forth and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what does that mean to me?</v>

1117
01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:58.210
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you can watch for this.</v>

1118
01:02:58.211 --> 01:03:02.170
<v Speaker 1>Like all you have to do is watch in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next week,</v>

1119
01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:07.060
<v Speaker 1>watch the things that attract your </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention because they will.</v>

1120
01:03:07.061 --> 01:03:09.520
<v Speaker 1>There are things that will automatically</v>
<v Speaker 1>attract your attention.</v>

1121
01:03:09.521 --> 01:03:11.000
<v Speaker 1>You get interested in them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1122
01:03:11.410 --> 01:03:14.070
<v Speaker 1>or they catch the corner of your eye and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1123
01:03:14.071 --> 01:03:15.630
<v Speaker 1>you have to look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1124
01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:19.180
<v Speaker 1>and those are the things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>shining forth in some sense and the idea</v>

1125
01:03:19.181 --> 01:03:20.014
<v Speaker 1>that they're shining forth is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite an accurate idea because here's </v>

1126
01:03:22.431 --> 01:03:25.000
<v Speaker 1>the way of looking at your perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1127
01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:29.790
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned that my little daughter </v>
<v Speaker 1>would take all these foil things,</v>

1128
01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:30.653
<v Speaker 1>make sense out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was always making one weird thing </v>

1129
01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:33.880
<v Speaker 1>out of something that we'd already </v>
<v Speaker 1>categorized.</v>

1130
01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:34.743
<v Speaker 1>So here's something to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you see when you look at the </v>

1131
01:03:37.211 --> 01:03:38.044
<v Speaker 1>world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is mostly you see your </v>

1132
01:03:41.711 --> 01:03:42.544
<v Speaker 1>memory</v>

1133
01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:45.870
<v Speaker 1>because you're not smart enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually see the world.</v>

1134
01:03:45.871 --> 01:03:46.704
<v Speaker 1>It's too damn complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you spent a lot of time seeing the </v>

1135
01:03:49.051 --> 01:03:49.884
<v Speaker 1>world and so you've built up all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations of the world and so now </v>

1136
01:03:53.191 --> 01:03:54.024
<v Speaker 1>when you see the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you use the representations because why </v>

1137
01:03:56.611 --> 01:04:00.270
<v Speaker 1>the hell wouldn't you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard to look at the world.</v>

1138
01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:01.823
<v Speaker 1>So once you learn to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to use what you've learned </v>

1139
01:04:04.501 --> 01:04:06.210
<v Speaker 1>and then what you see is what you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned.</v>

1140
01:04:06.211 --> 01:04:09.450
<v Speaker 1>You don't see the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I could all even say that as long</v>

1141
01:04:09.451 --> 01:04:11.670
<v Speaker 1>as things are going your way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never see the world.</v>

1142
01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:14.100
<v Speaker 1>You only see your representations of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1143
01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:15.750
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1144
01:04:15.751 --> 01:04:17.730
<v Speaker 1>what's behind that representation?</v>

1145
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:19.783
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1146
01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:24.730
<v Speaker 1>what's behind the representation is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that shines forth.</v>

1147
01:04:26.110 --> 01:04:26.943
<v Speaker 3>Now</v>

1148
01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:28.463
<v Speaker 1>I think people experience this when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>take hallucinogenic drugs because I </v>

1149
01:04:33.121 --> 01:04:33.954
<v Speaker 1>think what the hallucinogenic drugs do </v>
<v Speaker 1>in part is stopped them from seeing </v>

1150
01:04:37.021 --> 01:04:42.021
<v Speaker 1>their memories and then they see they </v>
<v Speaker 1>see the unknown as such more.</v>

1151
01:04:42.631 --> 01:04:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Although you can never see the unknown </v>
<v Speaker 1>as such,</v>

1152
01:04:45.210 --> 01:04:46.043
<v Speaker 1>but everything that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's no longer hyper attractive than </v>

1153
01:04:49.721 --> 01:04:54.721
<v Speaker 1>new and fresh and vital revitalizes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what Huxley reported in the doors</v>

1154
01:04:56.641 --> 01:05:00.340
<v Speaker 1>of perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we know that if you're,</v>

1155
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:04.950
<v Speaker 1>we know that if you're predisposed to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stimulus and the stimulus means nothing,</v>

1156
01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:05.873
<v Speaker 1>so first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something pops up and it attracts your </v>

1157
01:05:07.621 --> 01:05:08.454
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you see it again and again and </v>

1158
01:05:09.601 --> 01:05:11.580
<v Speaker 1>again and again and again and again and </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

1159
01:05:11.850 --> 01:05:15.540
<v Speaker 1>You habituate to it and then it no </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer has any effect on you.</v>

1160
01:05:15.541 --> 01:05:18.720
<v Speaker 1>It becomes invisible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that you habituate,</v>

1161
01:05:18.721 --> 01:05:19.930
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the wrong word.</v>

1162
01:05:20.770 --> 01:05:21.603
<v Speaker 1>You habituate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's the kind of stimuli that your </v>

1163
01:05:24.881 --> 01:05:27.070
<v Speaker 1>spinal cord could process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1164
01:05:27.071 --> 01:05:32.071
<v Speaker 1>So if you take a snail and it comes out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of its shell and you tap it,</v>

1165
01:05:32.471 --> 01:05:33.940
<v Speaker 1>it'll go into a shell and then it'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>come out.</v>

1166
01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:35.740
<v Speaker 1>You tap it and go into a shell and will </v>
<v Speaker 1>come out.</v>

1167
01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:36.753
<v Speaker 1>You keep doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sooner or later you can tap the snail </v>

1168
01:05:38.261 --> 01:05:40.650
<v Speaker 1>and it won't go into its shell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is,</v>

1169
01:05:40.651 --> 01:05:41.484
<v Speaker 1>is that the snail has figured out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>tap does not imply an event that would </v>

1170
01:05:45.881 --> 01:05:50.230
<v Speaker 1>require a snail to pull into its shell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it hasn't done that because it's all</v>

1171
01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:54.790
<v Speaker 1>reflex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in people we still have those simple</v>

1172
01:05:54.791 --> 01:05:55.624
<v Speaker 1>reflexes that can just habituate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then we have much more complex </v>

1173
01:05:58.721 --> 01:06:03.721
<v Speaker 1>models of the world that we have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actively engage in constructing and also</v>

1174
01:06:04.091 --> 01:06:04.924
<v Speaker 1>once we construct those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can stop us from reacting to the </v>

1175
01:06:07.271 --> 01:06:08.950
<v Speaker 1>stimulus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now think about it.</v>

1176
01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:12.940
<v Speaker 1>Here you are in this room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at everything around you,</v>

1177
01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:16.390
<v Speaker 1>which you can't do by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look at everything around you.</v>

1178
01:06:17.050 --> 01:06:19.210
<v Speaker 1>How many of those things are you </v>
<v Speaker 1>reacting to?</v>

1179
01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:25.480
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is none really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I bet I could take half of you out of</v>

1180
01:06:25.481 --> 01:06:27.670
<v Speaker 1>this room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can take all of the order of this room</v>

1181
01:06:27.671 --> 01:06:29.890
<v Speaker 1>and half of you wouldn't know what color</v>
<v Speaker 1>the room is.</v>

1182
01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:33.433
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right and right as long now because </v>

1183
01:06:34.771 --> 01:06:36.600
<v Speaker 1>that's all of a sudden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it shines forth.</v>

1184
01:06:36.601 --> 01:06:37.051
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1185
01:06:37.051 --> 01:06:38.640
<v Speaker 1>now that has meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1186
01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:42.960
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't know what color those sound</v>
<v Speaker 1>absorbing panels on the backer.</v>

1187
01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:45.540
<v Speaker 1>You probably wouldn't even know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's those are there.</v>

1188
01:06:45.690 --> 01:06:49.890
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't know the color of the floor</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the design on the floor.</v>

1189
01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:54.660
<v Speaker 1>You might not even know the color of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>chairs and and why would that be?</v>

1190
01:06:54.661 --> 01:06:57.930
<v Speaker 1>It's because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1191
01:06:57.931 --> 01:06:58.764
<v Speaker 1>why is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't you know those things that </v>

1192
01:07:01.711 --> 01:07:06.711
<v Speaker 1>you've been exposed to so often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and part of the answer to that is,</v>

1193
01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:08.610
<v Speaker 1>and this is an interesting way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it,</v>

1194
01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:13.040
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then you might think,</v>

1195
01:07:13.041 --> 01:07:14.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does matter mean?</v>

1196
01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:15.860
<v Speaker 1>Because matters a weird word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1197
01:07:15.861 --> 01:07:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Because things are made out of matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1198
01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:22.160
<v Speaker 1>But you can also think that things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>made out of what matters</v>

1199
01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:24.673
<v Speaker 1>and it's actually more accurate to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>of things as being made out of what </v>

1200
01:07:27.171 --> 01:07:28.004
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happens when you build a model </v>

1201
01:07:30.891 --> 01:07:33.650
<v Speaker 1>of what matters is that most of it stops</v>
<v Speaker 1>mattering.</v>

1202
01:07:34.790 --> 01:07:35.623
<v Speaker 1>And that's okay because you know you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to be overwhelmed by </v>

1203
01:07:37.911 --> 01:07:41.620
<v Speaker 1>everything all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mean maybe that's a paradise ul or maybe</v>

1204
01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:45.380
<v Speaker 1>a hellish experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it kind of makes you nonfunctional.</v>

1205
01:07:45.381 --> 01:07:48.350
<v Speaker 1>There's just not enough of you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>process everything all the time.</v>

1206
01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:53.560
<v Speaker 1>So you zero everything out by building a</v>
<v Speaker 1>model of it and the mortal says you this</v>

1207
01:07:53.991 --> 01:07:55.610
<v Speaker 1>is zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's irrelevant.</v>

1208
01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:59.120
<v Speaker 1>It has no bearing whatsoever on what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to accomplish in this time</v>

1209
01:07:59.121 --> 01:07:59.954
<v Speaker 1>and place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it ceases to draw your attention </v>

1210
01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:04.393
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you think,</v>

1211
01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:05.353
<v Speaker 1>wait a sec.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Everything has ceased to draw my </v>

1212
01:08:08.121 --> 01:08:08.954
<v Speaker 1>attention</v>

1213
01:08:10.490 --> 01:08:11.930
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a strange thing.</v>

1214
01:08:12.410 --> 01:08:13.243
<v Speaker 1>That's a strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember that little thing that </v>

1215
01:08:15.831 --> 01:08:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Harry potter used to chase around when </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was playing quidditch?</v>

1216
01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:23.120
<v Speaker 1>That's the unknown by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually a symbol of the unknown.</v>

1217
01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:28.300
<v Speaker 1>It's called the winged chaos and I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>no idea how the hell j Dot k dot rowling</v>

1218
01:08:29.541 --> 01:08:32.830
<v Speaker 1>knew about the weighing the chaos or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>round chaos is another way of,</v>

1219
01:08:33.170 --> 01:08:37.070
<v Speaker 1>of describing because if you put round </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos into Google,</v>

1220
01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:39.920
<v Speaker 1>the only thing you get is my website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

1221
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.130
<v Speaker 1>It's something I took from us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty damn old obscure.</v>

1222
01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:44.413
<v Speaker 1>But apparently she studied lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>alchemy before she wrote Harry Potter </v>

1223
01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:52.370
<v Speaker 1>and that knowledge consciously or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>made it into.</v>

1224
01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:54.700
<v Speaker 1>She's pretty damn smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's ad,</v>

1225
01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:55.910
<v Speaker 1>but she's creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1226
01:08:55.911 --> 01:08:56.744
<v Speaker 1>So if you're creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always a dance between your </v>

1227
01:08:58.521 --> 01:09:01.210
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and your unconscious mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>at creative dance.</v>

1228
01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Things emerge and you play with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1229
01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:05.720
<v Speaker 1>and the emerge and then you play with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1230
01:09:05.721 --> 01:09:06.554
<v Speaker 1>like the writers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know their characters come alive for </v>

1231
01:09:09.291 --> 01:09:12.050
<v Speaker 1>them and they may just write down what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the characters are likely to do.</v>

1232
01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:12.913
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when there's going to be some conscious </v>

1233
01:09:13.401 --> 01:09:14.234
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's this dance between </v>

1234
01:09:15.831 --> 01:09:18.710
<v Speaker 1>unconsciousness and consciousness that </v>
<v Speaker 1>really makes up creativity.</v>

1235
01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:19.851
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1236
01:09:19.851 --> 01:09:20.684
<v Speaker 1>in the Harry Potter quidditch game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens when Harry gets the little </v>

1237
01:09:23.031 --> 01:09:23.864
<v Speaker 1>ball,</v>

1238
01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:26.013
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1239
01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:26.853
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's really two games going on at </v>

1240
01:09:28.001 --> 01:09:28.900
<v Speaker 1>the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1241
01:09:28.901 --> 01:09:30.310
<v Speaker 1>There's the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone else's playing.</v>

1242
01:09:30.311 --> 01:09:31.144
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the game that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeker is playing and when the seeker </v>

1243
01:09:33.341 --> 01:09:34.960
<v Speaker 1>wins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone wins.</v>

1244
01:09:35.290 --> 01:09:38.110
<v Speaker 1>That's the rule and quidditch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the rule.</v>

1245
01:09:38.770 --> 01:09:40.660
<v Speaker 1>When the seeker wins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone wins.</v>

1246
01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:43.480
<v Speaker 1>That's the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's an archetype too.</v>

1247
01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:47.910
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the chaos,</v>

1248
01:09:47.911 --> 01:09:48.744
<v Speaker 1>the thing that Harry's chasing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the coolest thing because that </v>

1249
01:09:50.731 --> 01:09:52.980
<v Speaker 1>was the alchemical representation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter,</v>

1250
01:09:53.970 --> 01:09:58.020
<v Speaker 1>and it was a container and it contained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the dragon in some sense,</v>

1251
01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:01.380
<v Speaker 1>it contained matter and spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you caught it,</v>

1252
01:10:01.410 --> 01:10:06.410
<v Speaker 1>then you could inculcate the matter or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the spirit and utilize the matter.</v>

1253
01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:11.070
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to what attracts your attention.</v>

1254
01:10:12.810 --> 01:10:17.810
<v Speaker 1>I hate to say this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because what attracts your attention</v>

1255
01:10:21.251 --> 01:10:24.310
<v Speaker 1>is the same thing that Harry's chasing </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the quidditch games.</v>

1256
01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:25.263
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the category of what attracts your </v>

1257
01:10:28.091 --> 01:10:28.871
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1258
01:10:28.871 --> 01:10:30.430
<v Speaker 1>young was very interested in this.</v>

1259
01:10:36.510 --> 01:10:37.343
<v Speaker 1>He thought that what attracted your </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention was a consequence of the </v>

1260
01:10:40.081 --> 01:10:43.500
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of the higher self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The self is what he called it.</v>

1261
01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:49.230
<v Speaker 1>The self is what you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ego is what you think you are,</v>

1262
01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:53.820
<v Speaker 1>and it might also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's close enough.</v>

1263
01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:55.680
<v Speaker 1>The self is what you actually are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1264
01:10:55.681 --> 01:10:56.514
<v Speaker 1>you have no idea what you actually are </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't know very much about </v>

1265
01:10:58.381 --> 01:10:59.730
<v Speaker 1>yourself and you're really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1266
01:10:59.731 --> 01:11:00.421
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1267
01:11:00.421 --> 01:11:01.254
<v Speaker 1>really complicated and there's lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things going on that you have no idea </v>

1268
01:11:03.811 --> 01:11:04.644
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the world is a really strange place </v>

1269
01:11:06.570 --> 01:11:07.403
<v Speaker 1>and the self is also the thing that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are now and the thing that you were and </v>

1270
01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:13.290
<v Speaker 1>all of the things that you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially become.</v>

1271
01:11:13.710 --> 01:11:14.543
<v Speaker 1>And that's a strange idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you guys can help me think </v>

1272
01:11:18.301 --> 01:11:19.090
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1273
01:11:19.090 --> 01:11:22.560
<v Speaker 1>because I'd been thinking for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time about these sorts of things,</v>

1274
01:11:22.561 --> 01:11:23.370
<v Speaker 1>so there's that.</v>

1275
01:11:23.370 --> 01:11:24.001
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1276
01:11:24.001 --> 01:11:24.834
<v Speaker 1>is the unknown?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a reasonable representation of </v>

1277
01:11:28.051 --> 01:11:29.460
<v Speaker 1>the unknown?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As such,</v>

1278
01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:33.750
<v Speaker 1>the unknown as such is the place from </v>
<v Speaker 1>which matter and spirit emerges.</v>

1279
01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:36.210
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you think,</v>

1280
01:11:36.211 --> 01:11:38.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1281
01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:41.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying that's the best definition of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

1282
01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:43.620
<v Speaker 1>That's the best definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or we're gonna.</v>

1283
01:11:43.710 --> 01:11:45.420
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make that proposition.</v>

1284
01:11:45.421 --> 01:11:45.901
<v Speaker 1>You'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1285
01:11:45.901 --> 01:11:46.171
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1286
01:11:46.171 --> 01:11:47.490
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not right.</v>

1287
01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:50.340
<v Speaker 1>The best definition of reality is </v>
<v Speaker 1>material reality,</v>

1288
01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:51.893
<v Speaker 1>material reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can decompose it down to the </v>

1289
01:11:53.611 --> 01:11:54.444
<v Speaker 1>elemental and this and the atomic level </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's objective reality and </v>

1290
01:11:58.291 --> 01:11:59.124
<v Speaker 1>everything else is a secondary </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of that and that's the </v>

1291
01:12:01.861 --> 01:12:02.694
<v Speaker 1>modern worldview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although we don't and can't factor </v>

1292
01:12:07.081 --> 01:12:08.580
<v Speaker 1>consciousness into that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>

1293
01:12:08.910 --> 01:12:12.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a pretty powerful view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's enabled us to get a lot of places.</v>

1294
01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:15.750
<v Speaker 1>So then if you're going to offer a </v>
<v Speaker 1>counter position,</v>

1295
01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:20.520
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it took me probably 30 years to</v>

1296
01:12:20.521 --> 01:12:21.354
<v Speaker 1>figure this out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are many other people who have </v>

1297
01:12:23.581 --> 01:12:25.100
<v Speaker 1>made this case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So heidegger,</v>

1298
01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:25.943
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made the case that I'm making in young </v>

1299
01:12:27.661 --> 01:12:30.730
<v Speaker 1>made the case that I'm making all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>white knew that um,</v>

1300
01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:35.190
<v Speaker 1>so other people have wandered down this </v>
<v Speaker 1>path fundamentally.</v>

1301
01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:40.020
<v Speaker 1>So it's not as idiosyncratic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as strange as you might think.</v>

1302
01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:43.133
<v Speaker 1>What do you see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it that you are facing when you </v>

1303
01:12:45.331 --> 01:12:46.200
<v Speaker 1>face the future?</v>

1304
01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:49.533
<v Speaker 1>Now there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a variety of ways of thinking </v>

1305
01:12:51.341 --> 01:12:52.174
<v Speaker 1>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's think about how you act and </v>

1306
01:12:53.771 --> 01:12:54.604
<v Speaker 1>how you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you think about confronting the </v>

1307
01:12:56.831 --> 01:12:58.900
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

1308
01:12:59.050 --> 01:12:59.883
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the future as a field of </v>

1309
01:13:00.821 --> 01:13:02.950
<v Speaker 1>possibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1310
01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:04.420
<v Speaker 1>You do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do.</v>

1311
01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:05.313
<v Speaker 1>You see the future as a field of </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities and you use your faculty </v>

1312
01:13:08.261 --> 01:13:13.261
<v Speaker 1>of imagination to map potential routes </v>
<v Speaker 1>through that sea of potentiality because</v>

1313
01:13:14.471 --> 01:13:16.840
<v Speaker 1>you imagined that you could be a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you could be be,</v>

1314
01:13:16.841 --> 01:13:18.460
<v Speaker 1>you could be a plumber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be a lawyer,</v>

1315
01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:20.800
<v Speaker 1>you could be a supermodel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be a nerd.</v>

1316
01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Like there's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this,</v>

1317
01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:23.333
<v Speaker 1>there's all of these possibilities that </v>
<v Speaker 1>lie open to you and some of them are </v>

1318
01:13:27.251 --> 01:13:28.084
<v Speaker 1>more at hand than others in in that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could get from here to there very </v>

1319
01:13:31.931 --> 01:13:33.250
<v Speaker 1>rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1320
01:13:33.251 --> 01:13:35.980
<v Speaker 1>if you want it to go get a drink of </v>
<v Speaker 1>water in the next 10 seconds,</v>

1321
01:13:35.981 --> 01:13:39.580
<v Speaker 1>you could probably make that reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest itself,</v>

1322
01:13:39.850 --> 01:13:40.683
<v Speaker 1>but if you want it to be a billionaire </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's going to take a fair bit of </v>

1323
01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:46.420
<v Speaker 1>maneuvering to make that reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest itself.</v>

1324
01:13:46.421 --> 01:13:50.890
<v Speaker 1>So some are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some are there and some are far,</v>

1325
01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:52.143
<v Speaker 1>but you act as if what's your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're up against this possibility </v>

1326
01:13:55.001 --> 01:13:58.360
<v Speaker 1>and then what you also act out is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1327
01:13:58.361 --> 01:13:59.194
<v Speaker 1>the thing that can transform itself in </v>
<v Speaker 1>response to the transformations of that </v>

1328
01:14:02.291 --> 01:14:06.340
<v Speaker 1>possibility and everyone believes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they don't notice it.</v>

1329
01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:09.340
<v Speaker 1>And so your parents say live up to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>

1330
01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:17.280
<v Speaker 1>What in the world is that your potential</v>
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>

1331
01:14:18.670 --> 01:14:21.550
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me it's weird like it's hard</v>

1332
01:14:21.551 --> 01:14:23.290
<v Speaker 1>to measure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1333
01:14:23.291 --> 01:14:24.124
<v Speaker 1>if I gave you guys an Iq test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be some clunky way of </v>

1334
01:14:28.231 --> 01:14:32.730
<v Speaker 1>measuring part of your potential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not even easy for us to measure</v>

1335
01:14:32.731 --> 01:14:34.890
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you think,</v>

1336
01:14:34.891 --> 01:14:35.724
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this stuff that we call </v>

1337
01:14:36.601 --> 01:14:37.980
<v Speaker 1>potential?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>

1338
01:14:40.530 --> 01:14:45.150
<v Speaker 1>It's not the way things are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the way they could be and they it.</v>

1339
01:14:45.170 --> 01:14:47.730
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be that they could be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole bunch of ways,</v>

1340
01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:53.390
<v Speaker 1>not just one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what seems to happen is that this</v>

1341
01:14:54.811 --> 01:14:55.644
<v Speaker 1>field of potential collapses into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>single league actuality as we interact </v>

1342
01:15:00.481 --> 01:15:01.260
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1343
01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:06.260
<v Speaker 1>I should also point out that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>models propagated mostly by John Wheeler</v>

1344
01:15:07.621 --> 01:15:09.180
<v Speaker 1>and his school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

1345
01:15:09.330 --> 01:15:13.320
<v Speaker 1>he's a quantum physicist and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis,</v>

1346
01:15:13.321 --> 01:15:18.321
<v Speaker 1>he calls his hypothesis it from bit that</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a piece of information.</v>

1347
01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:19.733
<v Speaker 1>He believes that the ground of reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>is basically something that's best </v>

1348
01:15:22.021 --> 01:15:26.310
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized as information and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when consciousness interacts with it,</v>

1349
01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:27.173
<v Speaker 1>whatever consciousness happens to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it transforms itself from potential to </v>

1350
01:15:30.241 --> 01:15:33.840
<v Speaker 1>actuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It snaps into place and there is weird</v>

1351
01:15:35.370 --> 01:15:36.600
<v Speaker 1>corollaries to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>

1352
01:15:36.601 --> 01:15:39.150
<v Speaker 1>here's a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a bloody weird thing.</v>

1353
01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:42.840
<v Speaker 1>This is from wheeler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's say you go outside and you look</v>

1354
01:15:42.841 --> 01:15:47.150
<v Speaker 1>at a distant galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's maybe who knows how far it is away.</v>

1355
01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:49.560
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>3 million light years away.</v>

1356
01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:52.170
<v Speaker 1>You look at it in a Photon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hits your retina.</v>

1357
01:15:55.970 --> 01:16:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Wheeler claims that that photon couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have left that star 30 million years ago</v>

1358
01:16:01.791 --> 01:16:04.070
<v Speaker 1>unless you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was there now to perceive it.</v>

1359
01:16:05.850 --> 01:16:08.850
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a bloody weird thing to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't believe me,</v>

1360
01:16:08.851 --> 01:16:09.930
<v Speaker 1>you can look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1361
01:16:10.130 --> 01:16:10.963
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say something like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless I was reasonably sure that that </v>

1362
01:16:14.761 --> 01:16:19.761
<v Speaker 1>is in fact what he would say we learned </v>
<v Speaker 1>believes that the quantum wave form,</v>

1363
01:16:22.911 --> 01:16:26.120
<v Speaker 1>which is in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's something like this horizon</v>

1364
01:16:26.121 --> 01:16:26.954
<v Speaker 1>of potentials doesn't become realized </v>
<v Speaker 1>until it's interacted with by something </v>

1365
01:16:32.721 --> 01:16:33.554
<v Speaker 1>that's conscious.</v>

1366
01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:37.170
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not everybody believes wheeler,</v>

1367
01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:38.273
<v Speaker 1>but the physicist who don't believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>wheeler believe something that's even </v>

1368
01:16:40.411 --> 01:16:41.244
<v Speaker 1>weirder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They believe that every time a quantum </v>

1369
01:16:44.641 --> 01:16:45.474
<v Speaker 1>event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you go down far enough into the </v>

1370
01:16:47.101 --> 01:16:47.934
<v Speaker 1>subatomic realm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to events that are no longer </v>

1371
01:16:50.101 --> 01:16:52.470
<v Speaker 1>divisible basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a quantum event,</v>

1372
01:16:52.471 --> 01:16:53.304
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be the bouncing of an electron </v>

1373
01:16:55.501 --> 01:17:00.240
<v Speaker 1>from one shell atomic shell to a lower </v>
<v Speaker 1>shell,</v>

1374
01:17:00.241 --> 01:17:01.980
<v Speaker 1>in which case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

1375
01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:05.010
<v Speaker 1>it emits a photon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the bounces a quantum event,</v>

1376
01:17:05.011 --> 01:17:05.844
<v Speaker 1>the electron goes from here to here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't pass through the </v>

1377
01:17:07.561 --> 01:17:08.394
<v Speaker 1>intervening space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However that happens and then it </v>

1378
01:17:10.791 --> 01:17:14.060
<v Speaker 1>releases a photon and the photon is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum event.</v>

1379
01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:18.140
<v Speaker 1>And so things are quantum because at </v>
<v Speaker 1>some point you can't break them down any</v>

1380
01:17:18.141 --> 01:17:19.100
<v Speaker 1>further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your,</v>

1381
01:17:19.210 --> 01:17:20.043
<v Speaker 1>your computer screen is quantized right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you get the resolution of </v>

1382
01:17:23.481 --> 01:17:24.314
<v Speaker 1>higher high enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see the singular pixels that </v>

1383
01:17:27.111 --> 01:17:28.520
<v Speaker 1>it's made out of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's it.</v>

1384
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:29.930
<v Speaker 1>You can't go any farther than that.</v>

1385
01:17:32.810 --> 01:17:33.643
<v Speaker 1>So these other physicists believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>every time there's a quantum event that </v>

1386
01:17:38.511 --> 01:17:39.344
<v Speaker 1>could go one way or could go another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a new universe is created in which </v>

1387
01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:46.790
<v Speaker 1>if it goes one way here it goes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other way in that new universe.</v>

1388
01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:47.713
<v Speaker 1>And so there's like infinite numbers of </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinitely branching universes and you </v>

1389
01:17:50.931 --> 01:17:52.280
<v Speaker 1>might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well where are those?</v>

1390
01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:53.533
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't really detect them in some </v>

1391
01:17:57.651 --> 01:17:59.180
<v Speaker 1>sense and then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1392
01:17:59.181 --> 01:18:00.014
<v Speaker 1>that's a hell of a theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To explain something simple by all you </v>

1393
01:18:02.871 --> 01:18:07.100
<v Speaker 1>do is posit an infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite universes and Poof,</v>

1394
01:18:07.101 --> 01:18:07.934
<v Speaker 1>you solved your problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hardly an outcomes razor solution </v>

1395
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:15.020
<v Speaker 1>and then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why even bother with that theory?</v>

1396
01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:16.580
<v Speaker 1>And part of the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1397
01:18:16.581 --> 01:18:20.810
<v Speaker 1>there are people that are working very </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard on quantum computer computation and</v>

1398
01:18:20.811 --> 01:18:22.100
<v Speaker 1>quantum computation</v>

1399
01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:27.680
<v Speaker 1>involves the use of these things that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't comprehend it all called cubits q.</v>

1400
01:18:27.690 --> 01:18:31.920
<v Speaker 1>You be its.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a cubit is a state of matter.</v>

1401
01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:33.173
<v Speaker 1>That could be a variety of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>states but isn't any of those yet and </v>

1402
01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:38.813
<v Speaker 1>you can use those cubits to compute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the simplest way of saying what </v>

1403
01:18:42.121 --> 01:18:42.954
<v Speaker 1>you're doing when you're doing quantum </v>
<v Speaker 1>computation is that you're using the </v>

1404
01:18:45.151 --> 01:18:45.984
<v Speaker 1>universes that are pretty close to ours </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do your computations in so that you </v>

1405
01:18:49.681 --> 01:18:53.430
<v Speaker 1>can get a lot more done in a lot shorter</v>
<v Speaker 1>time because you're doing some things in</v>

1406
01:18:53.431 --> 01:18:54.264
<v Speaker 1>this universe and you're doing some </v>
<v Speaker 1>other things in a bunch of other </v>

1407
01:18:55.831 --> 01:18:56.664
<v Speaker 1>universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a lot more efficient and </v>

1408
01:18:58.261 --> 01:19:00.660
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well sure,</v>

1409
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:01.703
<v Speaker 1>but quantum computation does work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's even a company that has </v>

1410
01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:09.600
<v Speaker 1>manufactured what they claim is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum computer,</v>

1411
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:10.823
<v Speaker 1>although you can do quantum computations</v>
<v Speaker 1>at very local levels that's been </v>

1412
01:19:13.291 --> 01:19:14.124
<v Speaker 1>demonstrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one doubts that it's published in </v>

1413
01:19:15.330 --> 01:19:18.060
<v Speaker 1>journals like science and nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This actually happens.</v>

1414
01:19:18.210 --> 01:19:19.043
<v Speaker 1>There is a company that claims that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>produced a commercial quantum computer </v>

1415
01:19:21.661 --> 01:19:23.910
<v Speaker 1>and people aren't sure if that's true or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not for again,</v>

1416
01:19:23.911 --> 01:19:24.744
<v Speaker 1>for reasons I don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the computer is capable of doing </v>

1417
01:19:27.031 --> 01:19:30.210
<v Speaker 1>certain kinds of calculations much </v>
<v Speaker 1>faster than a normal computer camp.</v>

1418
01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:35.200
<v Speaker 1>So that's all pretty damn weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

1419
01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:36.513
<v Speaker 1>Now it seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I wrote a paper with my graduate </v>

1420
01:19:38.771 --> 01:19:39.604
<v Speaker 1>students about this and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were stretching our knowledge to the </v>

1421
01:19:44.110 --> 01:19:44.943
<v Speaker 1>right to the end of our limits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were trying to unite the theory of </v>

1422
01:19:50.201 --> 01:19:54.160
<v Speaker 1>anxiety with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with thermodynamics basically.</v>

1423
01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:58.360
<v Speaker 1>And we published this paper in a journal</v>
<v Speaker 1>called Psych Review,</v>

1424
01:19:58.361 --> 01:19:59.194
<v Speaker 1>which is a very good journal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very hard to publish in psych </v>

1425
01:20:00.991 --> 01:20:01.824
<v Speaker 1>review.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the only paper I've ever published </v>

1426
01:20:02.981 --> 01:20:04.180
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1427
01:20:04.181 --> 01:20:05.014
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1428
01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:10.840
<v Speaker 1>we're basically proposed that when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get anxious,</v>

1429
01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:16.540
<v Speaker 1>what you see in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you perceive in front of you,</v>

1430
01:20:16.541 --> 01:20:18.370
<v Speaker 1>you can't actually see it with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>

1431
01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:22.480
<v Speaker 1>It's more like you perceive with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body or your body perceives it.</v>

1432
01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:23.553
<v Speaker 1>What you see unfolding in front of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a large and indeterminant space of </v>

1433
01:20:27.731 --> 01:20:30.640
<v Speaker 1>potential world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

1434
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:31.833
<v Speaker 1>And that the reason you get anxious is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because all of a sudden there's all </v>

1435
01:20:34.241 --> 01:20:35.074
<v Speaker 1>those potential worlds you have to deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with and you didn't think that you were </v>

1436
01:20:37.181 --> 01:20:39.250
<v Speaker 1>going to have to deal with any of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>

1437
01:20:39.251 --> 01:20:40.600
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when does that happen to you?</v>

1438
01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:41.950
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1439
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.903
<v Speaker 1>so it's 20 below and you're late for </v>
<v Speaker 1>class and you jump in your car and it's </v>

1440
01:20:47.441 --> 01:20:52.420
<v Speaker 1>snowing like mad and you drive two miles</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden your car stops.</v>

1441
01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:55.470
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1442
01:20:57.300 --> 01:21:00.990
<v Speaker 1>what is it that you're sitting in now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you will say,</v>

1443
01:21:00.991 --> 01:21:02.940
<v Speaker 1>well obviously I'm sitting in a car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like.</v>

1444
01:21:03.070 --> 01:21:06.720
<v Speaker 1>And it's by no means obvious that what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sitting in is now a car.</v>

1445
01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:12.110
<v Speaker 1>It couldn't be a tomb if it's called </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough and even if it's not a tube,</v>

1446
01:21:13.050 --> 01:21:13.883
<v Speaker 1>you're not where you expected to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not where you want to be and it </v>

1447
01:21:16.111 --> 01:21:21.000
<v Speaker 1>isn't exactly clear where you are and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your body is going to get all.</v>

1448
01:21:22.350 --> 01:21:25.710
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just saw a dinosaur like,</v>

1449
01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:30.280
<v Speaker 1>and it's an apprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

1450
01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:31.133
<v Speaker 1>it's a perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a perception that the map that you </v>

1451
01:21:35.131 --> 01:21:35.964
<v Speaker 1>were using to map your environment to </v>
<v Speaker 1>define all the objects and to define </v>

1452
01:21:39.901 --> 01:21:44.250
<v Speaker 1>your relationship to those objects no </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer fits the territory.</v>

1453
01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:46.380
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1454
01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:50.130
<v Speaker 1>if your map doesn't fit the territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what the hell is the territory?</v>

1455
01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:54.930
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is many things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of which you cannot control.</v>

1456
01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:55.973
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might get lucky and all that has to </v>

1457
01:21:57.661 --> 01:22:00.720
<v Speaker 1>happen is that somebody comes and tells </v>
<v Speaker 1>you how long it takes you to a mechanic,</v>

1458
01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:03.180
<v Speaker 1>but even now it's going to rattle your </v>
<v Speaker 1>chains because,</v>

1459
01:22:03.630 --> 01:22:05.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your car breaks down,</v>

1460
01:22:05.221 --> 01:22:07.830
<v Speaker 1>how do you feel about having to take it </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a mechanic?</v>

1461
01:22:09.450 --> 01:22:11.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly you don't feel good about it.</v>

1462
01:22:11.250 --> 01:22:12.001
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1463
01:22:12.001 --> 01:22:13.620
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know if the mechanic will find</v>

1464
01:22:13.621 --> 01:22:14.454
<v Speaker 1>the damn problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know if you might have to get </v>

1465
01:22:15.721 --> 01:22:16.554
<v Speaker 1>a new car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know if you can trust the </v>

1466
01:22:17.731 --> 01:22:19.860
<v Speaker 1>mechanic to tell you whether you need a </v>
<v Speaker 1>new car.</v>

1467
01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:24.600
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a $2 part and like he offers </v>
<v Speaker 1>to put a whole new motor in and then you</v>

1468
01:22:24.601 --> 01:22:27.570
<v Speaker 1>have to deal with them or you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find a place to take it.</v>

1469
01:22:27.690 --> 01:22:30.210
<v Speaker 1>You have to assess whether or not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sharp is honest,</v>

1470
01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:34.110
<v Speaker 1>so it's like a whole can of snakes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of that kind of snakes is,</v>

1471
01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:35.393
<v Speaker 1>can I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it the case that the mechanic to who </v>

1472
01:22:38.971 --> 01:22:39.804
<v Speaker 1>might take this car is the thing that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>presents himself as now in an honest </v>

1473
01:22:44.641 --> 01:22:45.474
<v Speaker 1>transaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that problem never comes up because you </v>

1474
01:22:47.041 --> 01:22:47.874
<v Speaker 1>just assume that the person in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you is two dimensional and that you can </v>

1475
01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:54.720
<v Speaker 1>assume that they're identical with what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they say.</v>

1476
01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an honest transaction.</v>

1477
01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.830
<v Speaker 1>So then you're not dealing with a kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of snakes.</v>

1478
01:22:58.831 --> 01:23:02.040
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with a few words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it's not an honest transaction,</v>

1479
01:23:02.041 --> 01:23:02.874
<v Speaker 1>it's like what kind of snakes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe someone stops to help you on </v>

1480
01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:10.780
<v Speaker 1>the side of the road and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1481
01:23:13.980 --> 01:23:18.030
<v Speaker 1>that a good thing or is that a bad thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the person who's approaching you</v>

1482
01:23:18.031 --> 01:23:18.864
<v Speaker 1>in the snow storm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's isolated is also a can of </v>

1483
01:23:21.151 --> 01:23:21.984
<v Speaker 1>snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the other snakes that </v>

1484
01:23:24.901 --> 01:23:26.350
<v Speaker 1>come out like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1485
01:23:26.351 --> 01:23:29.640
<v Speaker 1>you weren't going to get to class and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have an exam,</v>

1486
01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:31.650
<v Speaker 1>and so then there's the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1487
01:23:31.651 --> 01:23:33.890
<v Speaker 1>what happens if I miss this exam and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that'll,</v>

1488
01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:36.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't do so well in this course,</v>

1489
01:23:36.121 --> 01:23:36.954
<v Speaker 1>and then I have to go talk to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor and it's going to be a big </v>

1490
01:23:38.821 --> 01:23:40.500
<v Speaker 1>mess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

1491
01:23:40.770 --> 01:23:44.640
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say that what happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>when your car stops on the way to school</v>

1492
01:23:44.641 --> 01:23:47.490
<v Speaker 1>is that everything around you turns into</v>
<v Speaker 1>a massive snakes.</v>

1493
01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Now obviously that's a symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1494
01:23:51.781 --> 01:23:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Because if it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not real snakes,</v>

1495
01:23:54.870 --> 01:23:55.703
<v Speaker 1>but they're not your damn car either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might to the degree that you </v>

1496
01:24:01.021 --> 01:24:03.450
<v Speaker 1>confuse what you're sitting in with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>car,</v>

1497
01:24:03.870 --> 01:24:04.703
<v Speaker 1>all you're going to be be as irritated </v>
<v Speaker 1>and upset because it's going to </v>

1498
01:24:07.531 --> 01:24:08.070
<v Speaker 1>manifest.</v>

1499
01:24:08.070 --> 01:24:08.903
<v Speaker 1>None of the features of a car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a car isn't a block of metal </v>

1500
01:24:12.151 --> 01:24:15.540
<v Speaker 1>with four tires on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a car is something you can ignore.</v>

1501
01:24:15.541 --> 01:24:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes you from point a to point B and</v>

1502
01:24:18.301 --> 01:24:20.610
<v Speaker 1>as soon as it isn't doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is the car.</v>

1503
01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:24.960
<v Speaker 1>It's some bloody chunk of metal with all</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of parts that you don't understand</v>

1504
01:24:25.170 --> 01:24:26.003
<v Speaker 1>that a bunch of people you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about are going to have to </v>

1505
01:24:27.991 --> 01:24:30.420
<v Speaker 1>manipulate before it will turn back into</v>
<v Speaker 1>a car,</v>

1506
01:24:30.570 --> 01:24:34.200
<v Speaker 1>at your expense and the day that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposed,</v>

1507
01:24:34.201 --> 01:24:35.970
<v Speaker 1>which you had all mapped out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was quite simple.</v>

1508
01:24:35.971 --> 01:24:38.220
<v Speaker 1>Poof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden it's not that day at all</v>

1509
01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:40.560
<v Speaker 1>and God only knows what sort of day it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be.</v>

1510
01:24:41.010 --> 01:24:41.791
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>

1511
01:24:41.791 --> 01:24:44.880
<v Speaker 1>it's a perfect setup for a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These things happen all the time.</v>

1512
01:24:44.881 --> 01:24:46.830
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone's car breaks down on a dark,</v>

1513
01:24:46.831 --> 01:24:51.000
<v Speaker 1>lonely road and you know God only knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>who comes out of the shadows to help.</v>

1514
01:24:51.390 --> 01:24:55.980
<v Speaker 1>It's a classic setup for horror movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the question is,</v>

1515
01:24:55.981 --> 01:24:58.320
<v Speaker 1>where are you when you don't know where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are?</v>

1516
01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:03.303
<v Speaker 1>I would say you're as close to reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>is every as you're ever going to get </v>

1517
01:25:08.301 --> 01:25:09.134
<v Speaker 1>when you are where you don't know where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are and it's a bit much to take and </v>

1518
01:25:15.051 --> 01:25:15.884
<v Speaker 1>so people do everything they can all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time to make sure that the amount of </v>

1519
01:25:20.571 --> 01:25:25.571
<v Speaker 1>reality that they have to come into </v>
<v Speaker 1>contact with is the limited filtered and</v>

1520
01:25:27.291 --> 01:25:28.124
<v Speaker 1>control</v>

1521
01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:30.910
<v Speaker 1>and we do that a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

1522
01:25:30.911 --> 01:25:33.400
<v Speaker 1>We do that by organizing our beliefs in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain way.</v>

1523
01:25:33.401 --> 01:25:35.350
<v Speaker 1>That's terror management theory </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally,</v>

1524
01:25:35.351 --> 01:25:36.184
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that we organize our beliefs to </v>

1525
01:25:37.271 --> 01:25:39.430
<v Speaker 1>shield ourselves from the reality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

1526
01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:40.773
<v Speaker 1>but we also organize our societies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>our interpersonal relationships in such </v>

1527
01:25:45.821 --> 01:25:46.654
<v Speaker 1>a way that were shielded from death and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that we don't kill each other and </v>

1528
01:25:49.631 --> 01:25:50.464
<v Speaker 1>that has nothing to do with the utility </v>
<v Speaker 1>of our beliefs and keeping the fear of </v>

1529
01:25:54.131 --> 01:25:54.964
<v Speaker 1>death at bay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something that keeps the lights </v>

1530
01:25:56.351 --> 01:25:59.290
<v Speaker 1>on and keeps this room warm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it's minus 20 outside,</v>

1531
01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:02.020
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1532
01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:06.830
<v Speaker 1>here we are in this room and everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows what this room is,</v>

1533
01:26:06.831 --> 01:26:09.680
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the same room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone pulls out a pistol,</v>

1534
01:26:10.590 --> 01:26:11.423
<v Speaker 1>it is really not the same place and </v>
<v Speaker 1>insofar as you think it's the same </v>

1535
01:26:15.711 --> 01:26:18.080
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that means is you're in real trouble</v>

1536
01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:19.123
<v Speaker 1>because it is not the same place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so things can shift and change on you </v>

1537
01:26:22.701 --> 01:26:25.760
<v Speaker 1>all the time and in fact to some degree </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what time is doing.</v>

1538
01:26:25.850 --> 01:26:26.683
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

1539
01:26:30.450 --> 01:26:31.590
<v Speaker 1>you remember though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1540
01:26:31.591 --> 01:26:33.390
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus Horace Story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1541
01:26:33.450 --> 01:26:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no.</v>

1542
01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:38.460
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus and ozharvest is like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like the way things are now.</v>

1543
01:26:38.550 --> 01:26:41.580
<v Speaker 1>There's a problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like the map.</v>

1544
01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:46.110
<v Speaker 1>There's a problem with that is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the territories are always moving around</v>

1545
01:26:46.111 --> 01:26:50.100
<v Speaker 1>and so your map is never quite uptodate </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you can't rely on no cyrus,</v>

1546
01:26:50.340 --> 01:26:55.260
<v Speaker 1>you know that if you have one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>google gps now and then they've taken me</v>

1547
01:26:55.450 --> 01:26:57.330
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the middle of parking lots,</v>

1548
01:26:57.600 --> 01:26:59.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the map thinks there's something</v>

1549
01:26:59.251 --> 01:27:01.530
<v Speaker 1>there that isn't there and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing there.</v>

1550
01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's not updated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't google.</v>

1551
01:27:04.261 --> 01:27:07.530
<v Speaker 1>It was the thing that I was using in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>car because Google tends not to do that.</v>

1552
01:27:07.531 --> 01:27:08.364
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the map isn't an accurate </v>

1553
01:27:10.531 --> 01:27:14.940
<v Speaker 1>representation of the territory and </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate pragmatic representation of the</v>

1554
01:27:14.941 --> 01:27:17.520
<v Speaker 1>territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can't navigate in it and you're</v>

1555
01:27:17.521 --> 01:27:19.290
<v Speaker 1>going to end up places that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

1556
01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:22.620
<v Speaker 1>So the map gets out of date as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory changes.</v>

1557
01:27:22.621 --> 01:27:24.360
<v Speaker 1>So Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cyrus isn't good enough.</v>

1558
01:27:24.361 --> 01:27:27.810
<v Speaker 1>The old map never works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kind of works,</v>

1559
01:27:27.930 --> 01:27:32.430
<v Speaker 1>and so you need horace because horace is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that updates the map.</v>

1560
01:27:32.431 --> 01:27:34.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like he's attending to those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1561
01:27:34.410 --> 01:27:35.243
<v Speaker 1>He's attending to those locales where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the map is no longer valid and updating </v>

1562
01:27:38.521 --> 01:27:40.170
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1563
01:27:42.030 --> 01:27:45.300
<v Speaker 1>back to the idea about the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>attract your attention.</v>

1564
01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:49.193
<v Speaker 1>It was either been swagger or boss and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately I don't remember which </v>

1565
01:27:52.150 --> 01:27:52.983
<v Speaker 1>because I always confuse the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>existential phenomenal logical </v>

1566
01:27:55.710 --> 01:28:00.660
<v Speaker 1>psychologists and one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it was been swinger,</v>

1567
01:28:01.350 --> 01:28:04.380
<v Speaker 1>said that reality shines forth and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other one said,</v>

1568
01:28:04.381 --> 01:28:04.651
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1569
01:28:04.651 --> 01:28:05.484
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You lay a structure on reality and the </v>

1570
01:28:09.731 --> 01:28:10.564
<v Speaker 1>structure is what allows things to shine</v>
<v Speaker 1>forth and it doesn't matter because you </v>

1571
01:28:14.381 --> 01:28:16.060
<v Speaker 1>can just put those two theories </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

1572
01:28:16.330 --> 01:28:17.163
<v Speaker 1>There's something shining in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>background and you have a map that's a </v>

1573
01:28:20.171 --> 01:28:21.004
<v Speaker 1>filter and now and then there's a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>hole in the map and you can see the </v>

1574
01:28:24.221 --> 01:28:25.054
<v Speaker 1>things that are shining through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the things that attract your </v>

1575
01:28:27.131 --> 01:28:27.964
<v Speaker 1>interest.</v>

1576
01:28:29.630 --> 01:28:30.463
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine that you have a part of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain that likes the map and just </v>

1577
01:28:33.081 --> 01:28:33.914
<v Speaker 1>follows it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would say that's the automatized </v>

1578
01:28:35.381 --> 01:28:36.590
<v Speaker 1>part of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1579
01:28:36.770 --> 01:28:38.720
<v Speaker 1>That's the part that's running on </v>
<v Speaker 1>algorithms.</v>

1580
01:28:39.110 --> 01:28:41.330
<v Speaker 1>So when you know a territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're driving home,</v>

1581
01:28:41.331 --> 01:28:42.164
<v Speaker 1>the hundredth time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hardly have to pay attention at all </v>

1582
01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:47.660
<v Speaker 1>because he paid attention 100 times </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you know the route.</v>

1583
01:28:47.810 --> 01:28:51.950
<v Speaker 1>You can rely on your preexistent skills </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're built into you.</v>

1584
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Literally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've built neurological models of,</v>

1585
01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:59.570
<v Speaker 1>of the landscape and the reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's an example.</v>

1586
01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:03.540
<v Speaker 1>You know before you can be a London taxi</v>
<v Speaker 1>cab driver,</v>

1587
01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:05.940
<v Speaker 1>you bloody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to take a test.</v>

1588
01:29:05.941 --> 01:29:10.290
<v Speaker 1>It takes like four years of study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to know the city and London's a</v>

1589
01:29:10.291 --> 01:29:12.030
<v Speaker 1>big city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't that.</v>

1590
01:29:12.031 --> 01:29:13.740
<v Speaker 1>You just have to know how to navigate </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it.</v>

1591
01:29:13.770 --> 01:29:14.603
<v Speaker 1>You actually have to sort of memorize </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole damn city and so they've done </v>

1592
01:29:19.110 --> 01:29:24.110
<v Speaker 1>scanning studies on people who've done </v>
<v Speaker 1>the London cab training process and what</v>

1593
01:29:24.301 --> 01:29:27.900
<v Speaker 1>they find is that from the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the four year,</v>

1594
01:29:27.901 --> 01:29:29.100
<v Speaker 1>three year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

1595
01:29:29.101 --> 01:29:31.530
<v Speaker 1>training period to the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their hippocampus grow.</v>

1596
01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:34.780
<v Speaker 1>So while why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1597
01:29:34.781 --> 01:29:37.240
<v Speaker 1>cause they have a big map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bloody big map.</v>

1598
01:29:37.241 --> 01:29:39.190
<v Speaker 1>It's all of London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1599
01:29:39.191 --> 01:29:40.024
<v Speaker 1>So the reason I'm saying that is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to be thinking that when </v>

1600
01:29:42.791 --> 01:29:46.200
<v Speaker 1>you've learned a route that you've just </v>
<v Speaker 1>updated your psyche.</v>

1601
01:29:46.230 --> 01:29:47.063
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just your abstract conscious </v>

1602
01:29:49.571 --> 01:29:50.404
<v Speaker 1>mind that knows something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've built the damn thing right into </v>

1603
01:29:52.391 --> 01:29:55.810
<v Speaker 1>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've built neuro structures that are,</v>

1604
01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:57.033
<v Speaker 1>that correspond in some manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some minimal manner to the territory </v>

1605
01:30:01.211 --> 01:30:02.044
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you can just run on </v>

1606
01:30:03.371 --> 01:30:07.360
<v Speaker 1>automatic and you want to run on </v>
<v Speaker 1>automatic because you know,</v>

1607
01:30:07.361 --> 01:30:11.730
<v Speaker 1>I bet you've experienced this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go somewhere for the first time it,</v>

1608
01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:15.010
<v Speaker 1>it's much longer the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it is the third time.</v>

1609
01:30:15.250 --> 01:30:16.300
<v Speaker 1>Have you had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has that,</v>

1610
01:30:16.330 --> 01:30:19.630
<v Speaker 1>have you experienced that as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How common is that experience?</v>

1611
01:30:20.210 --> 01:30:22.120
<v Speaker 1>To put up your hands if you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced that.</v>

1612
01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As people not experienced that.</v>

1613
01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:25.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1614
01:30:25.690 --> 01:30:30.310
<v Speaker 1>so I think the reason that is is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing a lot more neural.</v>

1615
01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:31.173
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot more neural events going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on when you're doing it the first time </v>

1616
01:30:35.651 --> 01:30:36.484
<v Speaker 1>and part of your time perception is how </v>
<v Speaker 1>many neural events are occurring per </v>

1617
01:30:39.971 --> 01:30:44.500
<v Speaker 1>fragment of time and so if a lot of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>are happening per fragment of time,</v>

1618
01:30:44.501 --> 01:30:47.500
<v Speaker 1>the time is going to seem longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If hardly any of them are happening.</v>

1619
01:30:47.501 --> 01:30:50.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like you hardly even notice the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and why should you?</v>

1620
01:30:50.890 --> 01:30:52.840
<v Speaker 1>There's no point in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You run,</v>

1621
01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:55.180
<v Speaker 1>you're running on automatized machinery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll say,</v>

1622
01:30:55.181 --> 01:30:58.540
<v Speaker 1>well that's so cyrus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you have another piece of machinery</v>

1623
01:30:58.541 --> 01:30:59.374
<v Speaker 1>that's Horus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that attends to those </v>

1624
01:31:01.121 --> 01:31:01.954
<v Speaker 1>things that the map hasn't covered and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would say this is a union idea of </v>

1625
01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:06.933
<v Speaker 1>primarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although of course you extracted it out </v>

1626
01:31:08.951 --> 01:31:09.784
<v Speaker 1>from all these ancient stories where </v>
<v Speaker 1>things shine through the map is what </v>

1627
01:31:14.501 --> 01:31:19.300
<v Speaker 1>attracts your attention and that tells </v>
<v Speaker 1>you whether or not you know it.</v>

1628
01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:21.393
<v Speaker 1>The map has a hole there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should fix it now as you fix the </v>

1629
01:31:25.441 --> 01:31:26.400
<v Speaker 1>hole in the map,</v>

1630
01:31:28.010 --> 01:31:31.850
<v Speaker 1>you also fix yourself because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>building yourself out of information.</v>

1631
01:31:31.851 --> 01:31:32.684
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corollary of that is you have a map of </v>

1632
01:31:34.101 --> 01:31:34.934
<v Speaker 1>the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your past and there's holes in it </v>

1633
01:31:36.981 --> 01:31:40.880
<v Speaker 1>everywhere and you can tell where those </v>
<v Speaker 1>holes are because you can't forget about</v>

1634
01:31:40.881 --> 01:31:43.910
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the whole might be you got bullied in</v>

1635
01:31:43.911 --> 01:31:44.744
<v Speaker 1>grade three and you were traumatized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's a hole in the map </v>

1636
01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:51.260
<v Speaker 1>because you're still that person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you've repaired the hole,</v>

1637
01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:52.153
<v Speaker 1>you're still that person and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>never going to stop shining through for </v>

1638
01:31:55.101 --> 01:31:57.080
<v Speaker 1>you unless you go back there and repair </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1639
01:31:57.230 --> 01:31:58.063
<v Speaker 1>and what that also means is imagine that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whole what shines through is is </v>

1640
01:32:03.970 --> 01:32:06.700
<v Speaker 1>horror in part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard on you,</v>

1641
01:32:06.910 --> 01:32:11.380
<v Speaker 1>but it's also information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's information and information.</v>

1642
01:32:11.381 --> 01:32:13.900
<v Speaker 1>There would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the hell do you deal with a bully?</v>

1643
01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:17.140
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe you go back and you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

1644
01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:18.820
<v Speaker 1>You really think through it and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1645
01:32:18.821 --> 01:32:19.654
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did I get bullied and why did I get </v>

1646
01:32:20.591 --> 01:32:21.424
<v Speaker 1>bullied?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And exactly what it is about human </v>

1647
01:32:23.081 --> 01:32:23.914
<v Speaker 1>nature that allows someone to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolent like that and what should a </v>

1648
01:32:27.791 --> 01:32:28.624
<v Speaker 1>person do to defend themselves against </v>
<v Speaker 1>that possibility and how can I become </v>

1649
01:32:32.051 --> 01:32:33.660
<v Speaker 1>that person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like poof.</v>

1650
01:32:34.110 --> 01:32:34.943
<v Speaker 1>Whole fixed and what that means in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>senses that you've extracted out the </v>

1651
01:32:39.041 --> 01:32:39.874
<v Speaker 1>residual information from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurrence that you hadn't been able to </v>

1652
01:32:44.381 --> 01:32:48.370
<v Speaker 1>or refuse to process when you first had </v>
<v Speaker 1>the experience.</v>

1653
01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:52.720
<v Speaker 1>Now in your brain being no stupid thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>is it's really concerned about this map.</v>

1654
01:32:53.890 --> 01:32:54.723
<v Speaker 1>It cares about the map and we're things </v>
<v Speaker 1>shine through because it doesn't want </v>

1655
01:32:57.491 --> 01:32:58.324
<v Speaker 1>you falling through holes and so every </v>
<v Speaker 1>place that what you don't know shines </v>

1656
01:33:03.131 --> 01:33:03.964
<v Speaker 1>through is either something you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>attend to now or something you can't </v>

1657
01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:12.120
<v Speaker 1>forget and what you do when you forget </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1658
01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:13.073
<v Speaker 1>you don't actually forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You learn that it doesn't mean anything </v>

1659
01:33:16.651 --> 01:33:20.730
<v Speaker 1>anymore because you've mastered it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is to forget.</v>

1660
01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:24.103
<v Speaker 1>A traumatized person can't forget </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they haven't mastered the </v>

1661
01:33:27.861 --> 01:33:31.250
<v Speaker 1>territory that constitutes the locale of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trauma.</v>

1662
01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:33.050
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>

1663
01:33:33.051 --> 01:33:33.884
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you're a soldier and you did </v>

1664
01:33:38.691 --> 01:33:42.530
<v Speaker 1>something seriously brutal in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan or Vietnam,</v>

1665
01:33:42.830 --> 01:33:47.830
<v Speaker 1>like seriously brutal and you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>forget it.</v>

1666
01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:53.310
<v Speaker 1>What do you do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1667
01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:54.263
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've dealt with people who have been </v>

1668
01:33:54.781 --> 01:33:55.614
<v Speaker 1>traumatized in one way or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or sometimes by things they've done in </v>

1669
01:33:57.751 --> 01:33:59.490
<v Speaker 1>sometimes by things that have happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>to them.</v>

1670
01:34:00.250 --> 01:34:01.083
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order for people to deal with a </v>

1671
01:34:06.281 --> 01:34:08.590
<v Speaker 1>traumatic event that involves </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence,</v>

1672
01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:11.740
<v Speaker 1>they have to develop a theory of good </v>
<v Speaker 1>and evil</v>

1673
01:34:13.220 --> 01:34:16.190
<v Speaker 1>because it's the evil in the malevolence</v>
<v Speaker 1>that traumatizes them.</v>

1674
01:34:16.370 --> 01:34:17.870
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've told you already,</v>

1675
01:34:17.871 --> 01:34:22.871
<v Speaker 1>I had two clients who suffered post </v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatic stress disorder because of the</v>

1676
01:34:23.301 --> 01:34:24.134
<v Speaker 1>way someone looked at them once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was only one time the person looked </v>

1677
01:34:27.951 --> 01:34:29.090
<v Speaker 1>at them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other,</v>

1678
01:34:29.091 --> 01:34:32.330
<v Speaker 1>it was repeated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a person who been bullied and it</v>

1679
01:34:32.331 --> 01:34:34.970
<v Speaker 1>took me a while to figure out that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>had posttraumatic stress disorder,</v>

1680
01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:37.790
<v Speaker 1>but she kept talking about the look on </v>
<v Speaker 1>his face.</v>

1681
01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:39.260
<v Speaker 1>What was an archetypal look?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1682
01:34:39.261 --> 01:34:42.970
<v Speaker 1>It's the luck of pure evil in so far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone can manifest that look,</v>

1683
01:34:42.980 --> 01:34:46.630
<v Speaker 1>it's like you can manifest that look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1684
01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:50.600
<v Speaker 1>and if you're a soldier and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifested that spirit,</v>

1685
01:34:50.601 --> 01:34:53.510
<v Speaker 1>that might be enough to knock out part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your consciousness,</v>

1686
01:34:53.511 --> 01:34:54.344
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens to horace when he </v>

1687
01:34:54.951 --> 01:34:56.690
<v Speaker 1>encounters seth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1688
01:34:56.780 --> 01:34:58.520
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes open.</v>

1689
01:34:58.670 --> 01:35:02.210
<v Speaker 1>You encountered something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You lose an eye.</v>

1690
01:35:02.570 --> 01:35:03.650
<v Speaker 1>You pay a price,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1691
01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:06.560
<v Speaker 1>It can damage you because it's so deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>and terrible.</v>

1692
01:35:06.770 --> 01:35:11.000
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you said about human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings and as such,</v>

1693
01:35:11.220 --> 01:35:12.053
<v Speaker 1>and this is the adversarial part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person there a heroic side and there's </v>

1694
01:35:15.051 --> 01:35:18.650
<v Speaker 1>an adversarial side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said all of your moral flaws,</v>

1695
01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:21.980
<v Speaker 1>your moral flaws are like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1696
01:35:23.170 --> 01:35:25.640
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an abyss underneath.</v>

1697
01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:26.713
<v Speaker 1>That's what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where the image of hell comes </v>

1698
01:35:27.891 --> 01:35:31.250
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything you do that's wrong.</v>

1699
01:35:31.251 --> 01:35:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Morally wrong is associated with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>abyss.</v>

1700
01:35:34.491 --> 01:35:36.650
<v Speaker 1>If you look into it deeply enough,</v>

1701
01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:45.800
<v Speaker 1>one of the things young thought was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

1702
01:35:45.950 --> 01:35:49.370
<v Speaker 1>and this is also the same with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists by the way,</v>

1703
01:35:49.371 --> 01:35:50.204
<v Speaker 1>and it's also the same with Viktor </v>
<v Speaker 1>Frankl and I believe it's also the same </v>

1704
01:35:52.911 --> 01:35:53.744
<v Speaker 1>with Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote about how to stand up against </v>

1705
01:35:55.851 --> 01:36:00.410
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have to maintain an honest</v>

1706
01:36:00.411 --> 01:36:02.810
<v Speaker 1>relationship with the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>attract your attention.</v>

1707
01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:06.230
<v Speaker 1>You can't ignore them if you ignore </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1708
01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens what?</v>

1709
01:36:07.541 --> 01:36:11.390
<v Speaker 1>We've already figured that out and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't fix the holes in your map and then</v>

1710
01:36:11.391 --> 01:36:14.420
<v Speaker 1>whenever you wander on that territory </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to fall right through and when you</v>

1711
01:36:14.421 --> 01:36:15.710
<v Speaker 1>fall through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to think,</v>

1712
01:36:15.711 --> 01:36:17.060
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world's cursed.</v>

1713
01:36:17.061 --> 01:36:18.980
<v Speaker 1>Look at all these terrible things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are happening to me.</v>

1714
01:36:18.981 --> 01:36:19.551
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1715
01:36:19.551 --> 01:36:24.551
<v Speaker 1>well if you weren't wandering around </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a self imposed degenerative map,</v>

1716
01:36:25.460 --> 01:36:27.920
<v Speaker 1>then maybe it wouldn't fall into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pits.</v>

1717
01:36:28.570 --> 01:36:30.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition.</v>

1718
01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:31.873
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the propositions is if </v>

1719
01:36:35.091 --> 01:36:36.860
<v Speaker 1>you read the terror management </v>
<v Speaker 1>theorists,</v>

1720
01:36:36.861 --> 01:36:37.694
<v Speaker 1>say those guys think that you gotta have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a psychological theory that's pretty </v>

1721
01:36:42.201 --> 01:36:45.170
<v Speaker 1>coherent and integral in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect yourself against death,</v>

1722
01:36:45.171 --> 01:36:46.004
<v Speaker 1>anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even though in the final analysis </v>

1723
01:36:47.811 --> 01:36:49.970
<v Speaker 1>that theory is false,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's insufficient,</v>

1724
01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:53.060
<v Speaker 1>it's there as a defense like a Friday </v>
<v Speaker 1>and defense.</v>

1725
01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:54.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if,</v>

1726
01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:57.620
<v Speaker 1>if not that then you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize yourself as a hero because</v>

1727
01:36:57.621 --> 01:37:00.470
<v Speaker 1>that boosts your ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you feel good about yourself,</v>

1728
01:37:00.650 --> 01:37:01.483
<v Speaker 1>and you can find temporary relief in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>delusional fantasy that there's </v>

1729
01:37:05.751 --> 01:37:08.890
<v Speaker 1>something special in heroic about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1730
01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:10.753
<v Speaker 1>That's a materialist interpretation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypal reality and it's a powerful </v>

1731
01:37:13.911 --> 01:37:14.744
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was Ernest Becker and Becker was a </v>

1732
01:37:15.831 --> 01:37:19.040
<v Speaker 1>smart guy and he took Friday and theory </v>
<v Speaker 1>to its ultimate limit.</v>

1733
01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:22.250
<v Speaker 1>He never read young adult and was a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake.</v>

1734
01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Giving has a different proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

1735
01:37:27.741 --> 01:37:28.574
<v Speaker 1>really different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His proposition is if you extract out </v>

1736
01:37:33.591 --> 01:37:34.424
<v Speaker 1>all the information that's available to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you by paying attention to the </v>

1737
01:37:37.161 --> 01:37:39.920
<v Speaker 1>disjunction between the territory and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the map,</v>

1738
01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:41.263
<v Speaker 1>so if you let your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you let what shines forth guide you </v>

1739
01:37:44.301 --> 01:37:45.134
<v Speaker 1>and you explore it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'll extract out enough </v>

1740
01:37:47.961 --> 01:37:48.794
<v Speaker 1>information from that process of </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration so that you can build </v>

1741
01:37:51.081 --> 01:37:55.500
<v Speaker 1>yourself into something so strong that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actually just no longer afraid of</v>

1742
01:37:55.501 --> 01:37:58.710
<v Speaker 1>death and there's nothing false about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1743
01:37:59.670 --> 01:38:02.310
<v Speaker 1>See the backer and the Friday instinct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's impossible.</v>

1744
01:38:02.430 --> 01:38:03.091
<v Speaker 1>They think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1745
01:38:03.091 --> 01:38:08.091
<v Speaker 1>basically you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a sand sculpture in a hurricane.</v>

1746
01:38:11.950 --> 01:38:12.783
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what people are and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know how tough they can be and </v>

1747
01:38:16.541 --> 01:38:19.270
<v Speaker 1>people can be unbelievably tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1748
01:38:19.271 --> 01:38:20.104
<v Speaker 1>You think about people for God's sake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like my sister in law works in </v>

1749
01:38:23.261 --> 01:38:26.110
<v Speaker 1>Palliative Care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1750
01:38:26.170 --> 01:38:28.630
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody she works with is gonna.</v>

1751
01:38:28.631 --> 01:38:32.620
<v Speaker 1>Like they're gonna die in three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She knows it.</v>

1752
01:38:33.410 --> 01:38:35.550
<v Speaker 1>She diluted about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1753
01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:36.393
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to her like she seems to be </v>

1754
01:38:38.231 --> 01:38:42.610
<v Speaker 1>quite aware and also quite happy when </v>
<v Speaker 1>her life is going well,</v>

1755
01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:44.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because she sees all the time.</v>

1756
01:38:44.621 --> 01:38:48.070
<v Speaker 1>What happens if it doesn't go well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like whole damn bottom falls out.</v>

1757
01:38:48.130 --> 01:38:48.963
<v Speaker 1>It's like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a little joke that I was </v>

1758
01:38:51.401 --> 01:38:52.830
<v Speaker 1>telling myself about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like,</v>

1759
01:38:52.900 --> 01:38:53.733
<v Speaker 1>how can you tell when you're having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good day and answered that is there </v>

1760
01:38:56.291 --> 01:39:00.370
<v Speaker 1>isn't a crocodile attached to your leg </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's about the right attitude.</v>

1761
01:39:00.370 --> 01:39:01.203
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're dealing with something like </v>

1762
01:39:01.931 --> 01:39:02.764
<v Speaker 1>palliative care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's basically how you think all the </v>

1763
01:39:04.211 --> 01:39:04.991
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1764
01:39:04.991 --> 01:39:07.720
<v Speaker 1>he had a rough day at school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not so bad.</v>

1765
01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:09.970
<v Speaker 1>At least there isn't a crocodile </v>
<v Speaker 1>attached to your leg.</v>

1766
01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:11.273
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I also think that that's what </v>

1767
01:39:11.891 --> 01:39:12.724
<v Speaker 1>happens to adolescents in cultures where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they undergo a really profound </v>

1768
01:39:17.260 --> 01:39:18.910
<v Speaker 1>initiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1769
01:39:19.270 --> 01:39:22.690
<v Speaker 1>they're taken out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's usually happens with the boys.</v>

1770
01:39:22.691 --> 01:39:23.524
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's because mother nature</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit blesses women with their own </v>

1771
01:39:26.650 --> 01:39:28.520
<v Speaker 1>automatic initiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1772
01:39:29.620 --> 01:39:30.453
<v Speaker 1>they take the boys out from their </v>
<v Speaker 1>mothers often their mothers are all </v>

1773
01:39:32.591 --> 01:39:33.424
<v Speaker 1>crying and unhappy about this and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that's ritual and some of it's true </v>

1774
01:39:35.981 --> 01:39:36.814
<v Speaker 1>because they're going to lose their </v>
<v Speaker 1>child and they take the kids out the </v>

1775
01:39:40.451 --> 01:39:42.970
<v Speaker 1>boys out and they like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just scare them to death.</v>

1776
01:39:43.690 --> 01:39:44.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they burry them,</v>

1777
01:39:44.681 --> 01:39:46.540
<v Speaker 1>they put them in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put them in a cave.</v>

1778
01:39:46.541 --> 01:39:48.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've ever been in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cave with the lights off,</v>

1779
01:39:48.611 --> 01:39:51.910
<v Speaker 1>but I can tell you a cave is very dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can imagine.</v>

1780
01:39:51.911 --> 01:39:55.090
<v Speaker 1>Imagine sitting in a cave for two days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1781
01:39:55.091 --> 01:39:56.260
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1782
01:39:56.261 --> 01:39:59.800
<v Speaker 1>what's in that cave?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is who knows?</v>

1783
01:39:59.801 --> 01:40:00.611
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spiders,</v>

1784
01:40:00.611 --> 01:40:01.720
<v Speaker 1>snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1785
01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:03.400
<v Speaker 1>cave monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1786
01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:07.480
<v Speaker 1>But I can tell you one thing that's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that cave and that's your imagination,</v>

1787
01:40:08.890 --> 01:40:11.200
<v Speaker 1>and believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to confront that sucker</v>

1788
01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:16.100
<v Speaker 1>with two days inside a cave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to wonder,</v>

1789
01:40:16.101 --> 01:40:18.770
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they ever going to come back and get</v>

1790
01:40:18.771 --> 01:40:20.930
<v Speaker 1>me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be wondering that.</v>

1791
01:40:21.050 --> 01:40:23.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if the roof caves in?</v>

1792
01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:26.420
<v Speaker 1>What if this is an evil trick?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>

1793
01:40:26.421 --> 01:40:26.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are,</v>

1794
01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:29.030
<v Speaker 1>what are all the things that could be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that cave?</v>

1795
01:40:29.510 --> 01:40:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever is really in that cave is,</v>

1796
01:40:32.020 --> 01:40:32.853
<v Speaker 1>is certainly not going to be any more </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible than the things that you might </v>

1797
01:40:35.991 --> 01:40:38.870
<v Speaker 1>imagine could be in that cave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1798
01:40:38.871 --> 01:40:39.704
<v Speaker 1>in some sense and initiation like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a confrontation with the ultimate </v>

1799
01:40:42.891 --> 01:40:47.600
<v Speaker 1>horrific limits of imagination and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>suspicion is if you get through that,</v>

1800
01:40:48.070 --> 01:40:48.903
<v Speaker 1>I mean and there's more to the initial </v>
<v Speaker 1>initiation ceremony then that because </v>

1801
01:40:51.441 --> 01:40:56.350
<v Speaker 1>you also get inculcated with the tribes </v>
<v Speaker 1>customs and beliefs at the same time,</v>

1802
01:40:56.580 --> 01:40:58.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're stripped bare in some sense in</v>

1803
01:40:58.991 --> 01:40:59.824
<v Speaker 1>that rebuilt as an adult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think part of what that initiation </v>

1804
01:41:03.671 --> 01:41:04.504
<v Speaker 1>does is show you the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>things you should be worried about and </v>

1805
01:41:07.151 --> 01:41:07.984
<v Speaker 1>things you shouldn't be worried about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't clear to me that you can </v>

1806
01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:10.743
<v Speaker 1>have your nervous system calibrated </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly until you've taken yourself </v>

1807
01:41:14.410 --> 01:41:17.320
<v Speaker 1>right to the edge because then you know</v>

1808
01:41:19.870 --> 01:41:24.040
<v Speaker 1>what's frightening and what isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's every reason to believe that</v>

1809
01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:28.370
<v Speaker 1>we have no idea how courageous people </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be.</v>

1810
01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:29.713
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can be insanely ridiculously </v>

1811
01:41:31.521 --> 01:41:32.354
<v Speaker 1>courageous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think palliative care work is a </v>

1812
01:41:33.771 --> 01:41:35.480
<v Speaker 1>good example of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1813
01:41:35.660 --> 01:41:37.370
<v Speaker 1>caring for the dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1814
01:41:38.660 --> 01:41:39.493
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that people who work in funeral </v>

1815
01:41:40.401 --> 01:41:41.690
<v Speaker 1>homes are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1816
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:44.180
<v Speaker 1>they seem to manage it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1817
01:41:44.270 --> 01:41:45.103
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to people who work in </v>

1818
01:41:45.771 --> 01:41:46.521
<v Speaker 1>funeral homes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1819
01:41:46.521 --> 01:41:47.354
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how the hell can you stand doing </v>

1820
01:41:48.711 --> 01:41:49.221
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>

1821
01:41:49.221 --> 01:41:50.054
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really makes me appreciative of my </v>

1822
01:41:51.831 --> 01:41:54.530
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that interesting?</v>

1823
01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:03.000
<v Speaker 3>Like the things that shine forth can you</v>
<v Speaker 3>shine towards some reality shining forth</v>

1824
01:42:05.860 --> 01:42:10.860
<v Speaker 3>from the structure that kind of covers </v>
<v Speaker 3>of reality.</v>

1825
01:42:12.461 --> 01:42:15.610
<v Speaker 3>So I kind of see that as like our social</v>
<v Speaker 3>work world.</v>

1826
01:42:15.611 --> 01:42:20.611
<v Speaker 3>Do you think humans can discern between </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of that shallow social,</v>

1827
01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:26.710
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>social things that interest us from what</v>

1828
01:42:26.830 --> 01:42:30.880
<v Speaker 3>reality actually is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things that shine from reality?</v>

1829
01:42:31.850 --> 01:42:32.411
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

1830
01:42:32.411 --> 01:42:34.460
<v Speaker 1>that diagram I showed you with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stacks,</v>

1831
01:42:34.461 --> 01:42:37.220
<v Speaker 1>there's a square,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has a little dragon on it.</v>

1832
01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Then there's a disc that's the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>

1833
01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Then there's another disc that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>great father,</v>

1834
01:42:40.981 --> 01:42:43.490
<v Speaker 1>and then there's a disk inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the hero.</v>

1835
01:42:44.030 --> 01:42:45.140
<v Speaker 1>Those are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are,</v>

1836
01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:46.033
<v Speaker 1>it's a map of the waste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things shine through fourth to some </v>

1837
01:42:48.531 --> 01:42:49.790
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1838
01:42:49.850 --> 01:42:52.310
<v Speaker 1>because I think the background is </v>
<v Speaker 1>illuminated.</v>

1839
01:42:52.311 --> 01:42:55.220
<v Speaker 1>The background of things is illuminated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

1840
01:42:55.580 --> 01:42:59.600
<v Speaker 1>And then we place what is essentially a </v>
<v Speaker 1>social structure on top of that.</v>

1841
01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:00.673
<v Speaker 1>Part of that's conceptual and perceptual</v>
<v Speaker 1>and part of it's actually out in the </v>

1842
01:43:04.731 --> 01:43:05.630
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

1843
01:43:05.690 --> 01:43:07.880
<v Speaker 1>when we're all sitting here just sitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

1844
01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:09.013
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all keeping the tremendous </v>

1845
01:43:13.161 --> 01:43:16.250
<v Speaker 1>potential that we all have for one thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>or another.</v>

1846
01:43:16.251 --> 01:43:17.084
<v Speaker 1>We're all keeping that under really </v>
<v Speaker 1>tight control and we're all doing it in </v>

1847
01:43:19.011 --> 01:43:20.120
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same way.</v>

1848
01:43:20.150 --> 01:43:20.983
<v Speaker 1>So basically the polite way to act in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation like this is as if you're </v>

1849
01:43:25.790 --> 01:43:29.180
<v Speaker 1>something that can be safely ignored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the thing is,</v>

1850
01:43:29.540 --> 01:43:30.373
<v Speaker 1>you have a map of the social world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like you have a map of the natural </v>

1851
01:43:32.961 --> 01:43:35.780
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is the social world and you have a</v>

1852
01:43:35.781 --> 01:43:39.530
<v Speaker 1>map of it and there is the natural world</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have a map in it of it.</v>

1853
01:43:40.100 --> 01:43:40.933
<v Speaker 1>So the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>novelty in the social world can also </v>

1854
01:43:43.941 --> 01:43:46.970
<v Speaker 1>shine forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here's here are you out?</v>

1855
01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:49.100
<v Speaker 1>You see what you think about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1856
01:43:50.450 --> 01:43:52.430
<v Speaker 1>so let's say you fall in love with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

1857
01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:54.873
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think the clearly that's a </v>

1858
01:43:56.331 --> 01:44:00.800
<v Speaker 1>delusional state because while it fades </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually,</v>

1859
01:44:01.250 --> 01:44:02.960
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1860
01:44:02.961 --> 01:44:04.940
<v Speaker 1>often what happens in a relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

1861
01:44:04.941 --> 01:44:05.774
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1862
01:44:06.430 --> 01:44:07.263
<v Speaker 1>The person who sort of illuminated that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be the effect they have on </v>

1863
01:44:10.991 --> 01:44:14.810
<v Speaker 1>you when you're infatuated or when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in love and then you know,</v>

1864
01:44:14.930 --> 01:44:15.763
<v Speaker 1>you learn all the ways that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite match that maybe or you habituate </v>

1865
01:44:19.271 --> 01:44:20.104
<v Speaker 1>to them or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the relationship accumulates a </v>

1866
01:44:22.361 --> 01:44:26.050
<v Speaker 1>tremendous number of errors and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>that disappears and you think,</v>

1867
01:44:26.051 --> 01:44:29.020
<v Speaker 1>well that was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an instinct and you're the victim</v>

1868
01:44:29.021 --> 01:44:31.090
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to fall in love like that.</v>

1869
01:44:31.091 --> 01:44:31.924
<v Speaker 1>You have to be stupid like that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise men and women wouldn't be </v>

1870
01:44:34.391 --> 01:44:36.130
<v Speaker 1>attracted to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that would be the end of it,</v>

1871
01:44:36.131 --> 01:44:37.750
<v Speaker 1>but it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's an illusion.</v>

1872
01:44:37.751 --> 01:44:39.700
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a chemically induced </v>
<v Speaker 1>delusion.</v>

1873
01:44:40.330 --> 01:44:41.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one way of looking at it.</v>

1874
01:44:41.711 --> 01:44:45.340
<v Speaker 1>But here's another way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm going to switch it a little bit.</v>

1875
01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:50.650
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the women in the class will particularly</v>

1876
01:44:50.710 --> 01:44:52.900
<v Speaker 1>experienced this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although men can experience it too,</v>

1877
01:44:52.901 --> 01:44:55.780
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly granted to women.</v>

1878
01:44:56.470 --> 01:44:59.230
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you see someone else's </v>
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>

1879
01:44:59.890 --> 01:45:00.723
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well most women and some men are quite </v>

1880
01:45:03.131 --> 01:45:04.360
<v Speaker 1>interested in babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1881
01:45:04.361 --> 01:45:06.130
<v Speaker 1>so they'll go up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like to interact with them,</v>

1882
01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:07.990
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're attracted to baby so,</v>

1883
01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:09.333
<v Speaker 1>but being attracted to someone else's </v>
<v Speaker 1>baby is nothing like seeing your own </v>

1884
01:45:13.361 --> 01:45:14.194
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like those are like those are </v>

1885
01:45:15.700 --> 01:45:16.533
<v Speaker 1>cataclysmically different experiences </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think the reason for that is the </v>

1886
01:45:20.471 --> 01:45:22.900
<v Speaker 1>only baby you can actually see as your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own</v>

1887
01:45:25.230 --> 01:45:26.063
<v Speaker 1>for everyone else's baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just see your representation of a </v>

1888
01:45:27.931 --> 01:45:30.690
<v Speaker 1>baby and the real baby shines through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit but not very much.</v>

1889
01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:33.360
<v Speaker 1>But what you're blessed with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a child,</v>

1890
01:45:33.361 --> 01:45:34.194
<v Speaker 1>and I think this probably is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of a biochemical </v>

1891
01:45:36.031 --> 01:45:36.864
<v Speaker 1>transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the memory structures that you </v>

1892
01:45:39.931 --> 01:45:40.764
<v Speaker 1>would use to process that child as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>known object disappear and all you see </v>

1893
01:45:45.571 --> 01:45:46.404
<v Speaker 1>is the baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's the same idea as the </v>

1894
01:45:48.241 --> 01:45:49.590
<v Speaker 1>archetypal infant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1895
01:45:49.591 --> 01:45:52.140
<v Speaker 1>the architectural holy child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1896
01:45:52.141 --> 01:45:56.460
<v Speaker 1>and it's certainly possible that each </v>
<v Speaker 1>infant is an architecturally holy child,</v>

1897
01:45:56.640 --> 01:45:58.590
<v Speaker 1>but the only person that can see that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mother.</v>

1898
01:45:59.040 --> 01:45:59.821
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1899
01:45:59.821 --> 01:46:03.390
<v Speaker 1>is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that an architect holy child?</v>

1900
01:46:03.810 --> 01:46:04.643
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one answer that might be it depends on </v>

1901
01:46:05.911 --> 01:46:07.960
<v Speaker 1>how you treat it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1902
01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.860
<v Speaker 1>if you treat it as if it's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>architecturally holy child,</v>

1903
01:46:11.010 --> 01:46:13.320
<v Speaker 1>then it has a pretty good chance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing into one</v>

1904
01:46:14.910 --> 01:46:16.730
<v Speaker 1>so and so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then let's,</v>

1905
01:46:17.290 --> 01:46:18.123
<v Speaker 1>let's switch that a bit and think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>a relationship that you would have with </v>

1906
01:46:20.181 --> 01:46:23.960
<v Speaker 1>someone when you fall in love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One possibility is that you're diluted.</v>

1907
01:46:24.110 --> 01:46:24.943
<v Speaker 1>The other possibility is you get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance briefly to see what that person </v>

1908
01:46:28.281 --> 01:46:33.281
<v Speaker 1>could be like if you interacted with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in the most perfect way you could,</v>

1909
01:46:34.130 --> 01:46:34.963
<v Speaker 1>so it's like a glimpse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a glimpse into a potential </v>

1910
01:46:39.890 --> 01:46:40.723
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily positive future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they visioned emerges and then it </v>

1911
01:46:46.521 --> 01:46:49.860
<v Speaker 1>shuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it's up to you to build it,</v>

1912
01:46:50.250 --> 01:46:53.370
<v Speaker 1>to make it happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take what you've seen in transform it</v>

1913
01:46:53.371 --> 01:46:56.970
<v Speaker 1>into reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't mean I don't think that</v>

1914
01:46:56.971 --> 01:46:58.590
<v Speaker 1>people can be diluted about</v>

1915
01:46:59.890 --> 01:47:00.723
<v Speaker 1>their partner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're diluted about their </v>

1916
01:47:01.541 --> 01:47:02.374
<v Speaker 1>partners all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think part of the reason for that is </v>

1917
01:47:04.691 --> 01:47:09.691
<v Speaker 1>that we build corrupt maps and we do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>on purpose and to the degree that you've</v>

1918
01:47:11.311 --> 01:47:12.144
<v Speaker 1>built a corrupt map,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the things that shine forth aren't </v>

1919
01:47:14.921 --> 01:47:18.910
<v Speaker 1>even going to be in the right place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the corollaries,</v>

1920
01:47:18.911 --> 01:47:21.160
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to talk about this a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>near the end of the class,</v>

1921
01:47:21.161 --> 01:47:24.550
<v Speaker 1>that is if you're going to follow the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that shine forth,</v>

1922
01:47:24.790 --> 01:47:25.623
<v Speaker 1>you better make sure you're not looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the world with flawed machinery </v>

1923
01:47:28.900 --> 01:47:32.680
<v Speaker 1>because my suspicions are that for </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like Jeffrey Dahmer,</v>

1924
01:47:32.681 --> 01:47:35.470
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that Sean fourth,</v>

1925
01:47:35.710 --> 01:47:38.200
<v Speaker 1>we're not exactly the things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would like to follow.</v>

1926
01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:41.140
<v Speaker 1>You know who Jeffrey Dahmer was?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1927
01:47:41.650 --> 01:47:45.780
<v Speaker 1>he was a brutal serial murderer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1928
01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:46.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was.</v>

1929
01:47:46.830 --> 01:47:47.663
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in in many situations like that when </v>

1930
01:47:49.951 --> 01:47:53.010
<v Speaker 1>someone is oriented towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily brutal crimes,</v>

1931
01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:55.860
<v Speaker 1>the brutality of the crime increases </v>
<v Speaker 1>with time.</v>

1932
01:47:55.950 --> 01:47:58.410
<v Speaker 1>The brutality of the crime increases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It starts with.</v>

1933
01:47:58.500 --> 01:48:02.790
<v Speaker 1>It often starts with the torture of </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals and then it proceeds and there's</v>

1934
01:48:02.791 --> 01:48:03.624
<v Speaker 1>no stopping it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like God only knows where it would go </v>

1935
01:48:05.940 --> 01:48:07.350
<v Speaker 1>and I mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bad enough.</v>

1936
01:48:07.351 --> 01:48:10.200
<v Speaker 1>So one character like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Wayne Gacy,</v>

1937
01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:11.393
<v Speaker 1>he was a clown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was quite the character when they </v>

1938
01:48:14.041 --> 01:48:16.530
<v Speaker 1>finally caught him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he asked to be killed.</v>

1939
01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.560
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shine forth thing,</v>

1940
01:48:19.561 --> 01:48:23.400
<v Speaker 1>is it kind of a tricky business because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1941
01:48:23.401 --> 01:48:24.234
<v Speaker 1>there's a line in the old testament or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the new testament that says something </v>

1942
01:48:26.491 --> 01:48:27.324
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>test the spirits to be sure to be </v>

1943
01:48:29.220 --> 01:48:32.310
<v Speaker 1>certain that they are from God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

1944
01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:34.650
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're looking at things in a crooked</v>

1945
01:48:34.651 --> 01:48:37.290
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what shines forth might not be the thing</v>

1946
01:48:37.291 --> 01:48:38.124
<v Speaker 1>that's best for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this like there's this </v>

1947
01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:40.853
<v Speaker 1>parallelism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going to take the risk of </v>

1948
01:48:43.201 --> 01:48:45.120
<v Speaker 1>having a life that's governed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning,</v>

1949
01:48:45.121 --> 01:48:45.954
<v Speaker 1>let's say you bloody well better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure that you're not lying to </v>

1950
01:48:48.181 --> 01:48:49.014
<v Speaker 1>yourself because all that will happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>then is that you'll follow a blind </v>

1951
01:48:52.021 --> 01:48:54.900
<v Speaker 1>person and you'll both fall into a pit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1952
01:48:54.901 --> 01:48:55.950
<v Speaker 1>So let's take a break.</v>
