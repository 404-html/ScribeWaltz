1
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.540
<v Speaker 1>So last time</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked a little bit about</v>

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.700
<v Speaker 1>the state of the world of belief I </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppose by the end of the 19th century.</v>

3
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.873
<v Speaker 1>And I talked to you a little bit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche and Dostoevsky and </v>

4
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Kierkegaard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.383
<v Speaker 1>a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very large number of the clinical </v>

6
00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:27.804
<v Speaker 1>theories that we're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussing for another two lectures </v>

7
00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:35.070
<v Speaker 1>after this one have been influenced by </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophers.</v>

8
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:38.460
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why I'm also talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you about the philosophers.</v>

9
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.103
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost as if in some sense the </v>

10
00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:43.854
<v Speaker 1>great philosophers have our tap directly</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the lower strata of the park are </v>

11
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.263
<v Speaker 1>our cultural systems of meaning as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>move forward in time and they can </v>

12
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.300
<v Speaker 1>outline what those structures are and </v>
<v Speaker 1>also describe their weaknesses and their</v>

13
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:06.270
<v Speaker 1>strengths and their likely </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformations moving forward.</v>

14
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.873
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously people can be behind </v>

15
00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:11.034
<v Speaker 1>the times and just as it's just as </v>
<v Speaker 1>probable that some people are ahead of </v>

16
00:01:16.531 --> 00:01:17.364
<v Speaker 1>the times.</v>

17
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.280
<v Speaker 1>And we would assume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're thinking about it,</v>

18
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.143
<v Speaker 1>say from a big five trait perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the people who are ahead of the </v>

19
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:28.290
<v Speaker 1>times often are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very intelligent and very,</v>

20
00:01:28.291 --> 00:01:29.124
<v Speaker 1>very open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's a pretty good </v>

21
00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:33.520
<v Speaker 1>definition of a philosopher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

22
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.453
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche and Dostoevsky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think more than any other two </v>

23
00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:44.301
<v Speaker 1>thinkers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had their finger on the pulse of the</v>

24
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.823
<v Speaker 1>transmutation of cultural systems of </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning in the at the end of the 19th </v>

25
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:52.224
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were both very concerned about </v>

26
00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:55.974
<v Speaker 1>the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the systems of meaning within which </v>

27
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.620
<v Speaker 1>Western civilization at least had taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>shape,</v>

28
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.610
<v Speaker 1>had been fragmented for a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

29
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.660
<v Speaker 1>The most important of which was likely </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rise of the scientific world view.</v>

30
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.310
<v Speaker 1>And as I detailed to you in the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture,</v>

31
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.560
<v Speaker 1>both Dostoyevsky and Nichi believed that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that had left modern people.</v>

32
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Because I think in the early 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century it was Western people.</v>

33
00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:30.594
<v Speaker 1>But now I think it's reasonable to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's modern people in a state of </v>

34
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.730
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

35
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.960
<v Speaker 1>their cultural discontinuity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that things,</v>

36
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.183
<v Speaker 1>belief systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also technological systems now have </v>

37
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.263
<v Speaker 1>transformed the world so radically that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the conflict between modernism and </v>

38
00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:57.270
<v Speaker 1>traditional forms of belief is acutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt everywhere.</v>

39
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.183
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the forces that have </v>

40
00:03:03.341 --> 00:03:04.174
<v Speaker 1>given rise to the battle between Islamic</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalism and modernism because </v>

41
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:12.064
<v Speaker 1>it's more of that than a battle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamic fundamentalism against the </v>

42
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:18.590
<v Speaker 1>Western world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem fundamentally is,</v>

43
00:03:18.591 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 1>is that people typically exist within </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural constructs that are very,</v>

44
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:27.200
<v Speaker 1>very ancient and that have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are grounded in,</v>

45
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.353
<v Speaker 1>in evolved systems of meaning that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are even deeper than the ones that are </v>

46
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
<v Speaker 1>articulated and explicit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when there's a period of very,</v>

47
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:39.934
<v Speaker 1>very rapid cognitive and technological </v>
<v Speaker 1>change than the integrity of those </v>

48
00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:49.381
<v Speaker 1>systems starts to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starts to become questionable from an</v>

49
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.863
<v Speaker 1>explicit perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also starts to become </v>

50
00:03:55.421 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 1>insufficient from a practical </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

51
00:03:57.671 --> 00:03:58.504
<v Speaker 1>So one example that you might give some </v>
<v Speaker 1>consideration to is the fact of the </v>

52
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:06.700
<v Speaker 1>introduction of the birth control pill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

53
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:07.683
<v Speaker 1>no one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you listen to politically minded </v>

54
00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:13.000
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make the case that the</v>

55
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.480
<v Speaker 1>emancipation of women was essentially a </v>
<v Speaker 1>political matter.</v>

56
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.380
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think that that's a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable way of looking at it at all.</v>

57
00:04:23.381 --> 00:04:24.280
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things,</v>

58
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.293
<v Speaker 1>everything feeds back onto itself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are multiple causal pathways to </v>

59
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:31.354
<v Speaker 1>any end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The radical element in the emancipation </v>

60
00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:40.390
<v Speaker 1>of women was of course the development </v>
<v Speaker 1>of efficient forms of contraception,</v>

61
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.120
<v Speaker 1>most particularly the birth control </v>
<v Speaker 1>pill.</v>

62
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.130
<v Speaker 1>And it's the case that as soon as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>educate women anywhere in the world,</v>

63
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.060
<v Speaker 1>not only does economic productivity rise</v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatically,</v>

64
00:04:52.061 --> 00:04:52.894
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually the best predictor of </v>

65
00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:54.814
<v Speaker 1>increase in economic predict </v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity in a modernizing state is </v>

66
00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.980
<v Speaker 1>the granting of rights to women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

67
00:04:59.981 --> 00:05:00.814
<v Speaker 1>whether it's directly because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>granting of rights to women or because </v>

68
00:05:05.561 --> 00:05:06.394
<v Speaker 1>of the existence of an underlying belief</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure that allows the concept of </v>

69
00:05:10.241 --> 00:05:14.470
<v Speaker 1>right to expand quite rapidly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to be sure of.</v>

70
00:05:14.471 --> 00:05:15.304
<v Speaker 1>But in any case that exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course the other thing that </v>

71
00:05:18.371 --> 00:05:23.371
<v Speaker 1>happens is that women stop having </v>
<v Speaker 1>children unbelievably rapidly.</v>

72
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.990
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

73
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.440
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's Iran</v>
<v Speaker 1>where this has been most market over the</v>

74
00:05:31.691 --> 00:05:32.524
<v Speaker 1>last two generations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So from family sizes far greater than </v>

75
00:05:35.861 --> 00:05:37.560
<v Speaker 1>replacement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two family sizes,</v>

76
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.170
<v Speaker 1>well below replacement in basically one </v>
<v Speaker 1>or two generations.</v>

77
00:05:41.171 --> 00:05:42.004
<v Speaker 1>It's a massive transformation and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily something that anyone </v>

78
00:05:44.621 --> 00:05:48.700
<v Speaker 1>expected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the sequence of forces that</v>

79
00:05:48.701 --> 00:05:53.701
<v Speaker 1>are</v>
<v Speaker 1>rapidly allowing our population to reach</v>

80
00:05:53.861 --> 00:05:56.320
<v Speaker 1>a peak and then either stabilize or </v>
<v Speaker 1>decline.</v>

81
00:05:56.321 --> 00:06:00.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many of you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the projections are that there'll be</v>

82
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:04.250
<v Speaker 1>9 billion people on the earth within 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>to 50 years.</v>

83
00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:06.590
<v Speaker 1>And that'll be our peak population after</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

84
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:08.840
<v Speaker 1>it will fall rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

85
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:12.340
<v Speaker 1>you can see that sort of thing happening</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now all over the western world.</v>

86
00:06:12.341 --> 00:06:16.550
<v Speaker 1>And it's happening a lot in China and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's happening in Japan where you know,</v>

87
00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:17.384
<v Speaker 1>there are more older people than there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are younger people because the younger </v>

88
00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:23.450
<v Speaker 1>people aren't having enough children to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually replace the population.</v>

89
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.350
<v Speaker 1>So the probability that we'll peak at </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 9 billion and then start to fall,</v>

90
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:28.723
<v Speaker 1>it's not certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what the best projections </v>

91
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.060
<v Speaker 1>seemed to indicate now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

92
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.913
<v Speaker 1>so what happens anyways with in periods </v>
<v Speaker 1>of very rapid technological and and </v>

93
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.360
<v Speaker 1>cognitive transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because those things go together,</v>

94
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.493
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the certainties upon which people base </v>

95
00:06:44.691 --> 00:06:45.524
<v Speaker 1>their interpretation of the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>even more importantly base their </v>

96
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:55.270
<v Speaker 1>judgments about how to act start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become uncertain.</v>

97
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.170
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

98
00:06:57.171 --> 00:07:01.820
<v Speaker 1>if you introduced the birth control pill</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a population and you put,</v>

99
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.193
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women's reproductive faculties under </v>

100
00:07:05.451 --> 00:07:06.284
<v Speaker 1>their own voluntary choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you radically transform virtually </v>

101
00:07:09.261 --> 00:07:12.890
<v Speaker 1>all of societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamental social structures,</v>

102
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.830
<v Speaker 1>not least marriage and marriage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>

103
00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:20.570
<v Speaker 1>is being regarded classically as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>foundation of civilization.</v>

104
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:21.463
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly there are more people who </v>

105
00:07:25.551 --> 00:07:29.270
<v Speaker 1>aren't married then there are people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are married now.</v>

106
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.513
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to know what to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that because of course there's no </v>

107
00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:35.054
<v Speaker 1>setting the clock back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even clear that you would want </v>

108
00:07:39.921 --> 00:07:42.230
<v Speaker 1>to set back the clock if you could.</v>

109
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.513
<v Speaker 1>But expecting cultural constructs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which take centuries or maybe even </v>

110
00:07:47.871 --> 00:07:50.930
<v Speaker 1>thousands or maybe even tens of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years to develop,</v>

111
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.200
<v Speaker 1>to keep up with change of that magnitude</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it's not possible.</v>

112
00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.633
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you guys face technological </v>

113
00:08:00.321 --> 00:08:04.970
<v Speaker 1>transformations that are earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>shattering on an almost yearly basis and</v>

114
00:08:04.971 --> 00:08:06.560
<v Speaker 1>you hardly even notice it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

115
00:08:06.561 --> 00:08:08.900
<v Speaker 1>tinder is a good example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

116
00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:11.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but tinder has produced quite a spike in</v>

117
00:08:11.481 --> 00:08:14.120
<v Speaker 1>sexually transmitted diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

118
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.983
<v Speaker 1>it's a radical technology because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first technology that's ever been </v>

119
00:08:17.751 --> 00:08:22.751
<v Speaker 1>invented that enables men to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>partners with no fear,</v>

120
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:24.403
<v Speaker 1>with virtually no fear of rejection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's been a limiting </v>

121
00:08:27.471 --> 00:08:28.304
<v Speaker 1>factor for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been a defining feature of the </v>

122
00:08:30.861 --> 00:08:33.830
<v Speaker 1>interactions between men and women ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>since history began.</v>

123
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:39.580
<v Speaker 1>And so these things are occurring at an </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary rate and of course it's,</v>

124
00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:42.363
<v Speaker 1>it's not reasonable to expect are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>slower moving cultural constructs to </v>

125
00:08:47.451 --> 00:08:48.170
<v Speaker 1>keep up with them.</v>

126
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.660
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because as well that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

127
00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.110
<v Speaker 1>people talk for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the divisive nature of religion.</v>

128
00:08:54.111 --> 00:08:56.640
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you often hear people who are critics of</v>

129
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.700
<v Speaker 1>formal religion in particular talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that religion,</v>

130
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:04.320
<v Speaker 1>underwire underlies a tremendous amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of destruction and warfare and conflict.</v>

131
00:09:04.321 --> 00:09:06.000
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

132
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.190
<v Speaker 1>it isn't religion that does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

133
00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:09.024
<v Speaker 1>it's tribalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tribalism characterizes even </v>

134
00:09:11.431 --> 00:09:12.264
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think chimpanzees go to war </v>

135
00:09:14.341 --> 00:09:17.130
<v Speaker 1>with each other for religious reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

136
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.263
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the religious groupings of mankind are </v>

137
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:25.130
<v Speaker 1>our large scale manifestations of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same phenomena that produce dominance,</v>

138
00:09:25.171 --> 00:09:26.004
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course large scale religions </v>

139
00:09:29.011 --> 00:09:29.844
<v Speaker 1>unite people within the religion just as</v>
<v Speaker 1>much as they divide people on the </v>

140
00:09:33.331 --> 00:09:36.750
<v Speaker 1>outside of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So part of the accumulation of religious</v>

141
00:09:36.751 --> 00:09:37.584
<v Speaker 1>tradition across time is a process that </v>
<v Speaker 1>allows thousands and 10 thousands and </v>

142
00:09:41.761 --> 00:09:42.594
<v Speaker 1>even millions of people to exist within </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same hierarchy of values and exist </v>

143
00:09:47.371 --> 00:09:48.570
<v Speaker 1>relatively peacefully.</v>

144
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.660
<v Speaker 1>As a consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm saying relatively peacefully,</v>

145
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:53.243
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred years ago it was thought that </v>

146
00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:57.443
<v Speaker 1>pre let's say let's say archaic people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those would be people who are still </v>

147
00:10:01.381 --> 00:10:05.310
<v Speaker 1>living a fairly isolated tribal life in </v>
<v Speaker 1>small groups pre,</v>

148
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:06.383
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically operating at the level of </v>

149
00:10:07.471 --> 00:10:09.150
<v Speaker 1>stone age technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say.</v>

150
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:13.830
<v Speaker 1>The idea was there was a very popular </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea for a long time that those cultures</v>

151
00:10:13.831 --> 00:10:17.940
<v Speaker 1>were um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>communistic and violence free.</v>

152
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.940
<v Speaker 1>And that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not violence for you at all.</v>

153
00:10:20.941 --> 00:10:23.240
<v Speaker 1>If you track the homicide rates in stone</v>
<v Speaker 1>age,</v>

154
00:10:23.241 --> 00:10:24.074
<v Speaker 1>culture is they're way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way higher than they are in civilized </v>

155
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:28.830
<v Speaker 1>cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like orders of magnitude higher.</v>

156
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.350
<v Speaker 1>And there's a variety of reasons for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

157
00:10:31.351 --> 00:10:32.184
<v Speaker 1>But I'm just telling you that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to dispense with the idea that </v>

158
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:36.893
<v Speaker 1>along with complex civilizations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this fred say of unifying religious </v>

159
00:10:40.831 --> 00:10:42.210
<v Speaker 1>beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an increase,</v>

160
00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.153
<v Speaker 1>an increase in baseline violence because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just no evidence for that at </v>

161
00:10:45.751 --> 00:10:46.584
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

162
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem with these large scale </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief systems is they're not very fast.</v>

163
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.850
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason for that is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in order for a large scale belief system</v>

164
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:57.080
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

165
00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:58.303
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

166
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:59.303
<v Speaker 1>manifest itself in any reasonable form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be predicated on the mutual </v>

167
00:11:04.921 --> 00:11:09.921
<v Speaker 1>agreement of the people within whom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within,</v>

168
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.430
<v Speaker 1>who operate within its embrace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

169
00:11:14.431 --> 00:11:15.264
<v Speaker 1>So for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Toronto to exist as a city has a </v>

170
00:11:18.091 --> 00:11:21.630
<v Speaker 1>peaceful city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically what has to happen is that the</v>

171
00:11:21.631 --> 00:11:22.464
<v Speaker 1>vast majority of us have to agree that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rules that govern the city and the </v>

172
00:11:26.941 --> 00:11:30.360
<v Speaker 1>social interactions within the city are </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful.</v>

173
00:11:30.361 --> 00:11:31.194
<v Speaker 1>And just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and because if you don't agree with </v>

174
00:11:34.141 --> 00:11:34.974
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then splinter movements of all sorts </v>

175
00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:41.250
<v Speaker 1>start to occur and people become more </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary in their modes of action.</v>

176
00:11:41.251 --> 00:11:44.250
<v Speaker 1>And then they become more violent than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole system starts to break down.</v>

177
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:45.083
<v Speaker 1>So it's not easy to establish a </v>
<v Speaker 1>collective norm because people have to </v>

178
00:11:50.881 --> 00:11:51.714
<v Speaker 1>agree to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can imagine that hammering out </v>

179
00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:57.940
<v Speaker 1>agreement with anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with even a small agreement that affects</v>

180
00:11:57.941 --> 00:11:58.774
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people is a process that takes a </v>

181
00:12:00.431 --> 00:12:01.264
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people can argue forever about the </v>

182
00:12:03.371 --> 00:12:07.750
<v Speaker 1>smallest alterations in the systems that</v>
<v Speaker 1>regulate our behavior.</v>

183
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.453
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

184
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:13.240
<v Speaker 1>some of you might be familiar with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>terror management theories.</v>

185
00:12:13.241 --> 00:12:15.490
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have heard of terror </v>
<v Speaker 1>management theory?</v>

186
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.133
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

187
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.273
<v Speaker 1>the terror management theories are </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicated on the idea that our belief </v>

188
00:12:20.791 --> 00:12:23.470
<v Speaker 1>systems protect us from our fear of </v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

189
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:24.933
<v Speaker 1>Now exactly how they do that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>specified particularly well in the </v>

190
00:12:27.731 --> 00:12:30.550
<v Speaker 1>terror management theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the originator of the theory,</v>

191
00:12:30.551 --> 00:12:31.384
<v Speaker 1>whose name was Ernest Becker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a sociologist by the way on a </v>

192
00:12:34.601 --> 00:12:35.434
<v Speaker 1>Friday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

193
00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:40.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that cultural systems enabled us</v>

194
00:12:41.351 --> 00:12:46.270
<v Speaker 1>to attribute beliefs to our actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finite and infinite,</v>

195
00:12:46.271 --> 00:12:49.870
<v Speaker 1>so that we could consider ourselves in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to mortality.</v>

196
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.940
<v Speaker 1>And in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hide from the truth of the,</v>

197
00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.760
<v Speaker 1>a tune of our existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

198
00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:59.740
<v Speaker 1>one of the things the terror management </v>
<v Speaker 1>theorists don't really give any credence</v>

199
00:12:59.741 --> 00:13:04.210
<v Speaker 1>to is the fact that belief systems are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not only systems of belief,</v>

200
00:13:04.211 --> 00:13:07.540
<v Speaker 1>there's systems of action regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

201
00:13:07.541 --> 00:13:11.290
<v Speaker 1>So we've talked about the Piagetian </v>
<v Speaker 1>notion of a game.</v>

202
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:12.903
<v Speaker 1>The game exists first as something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone can play and only later as </v>

203
00:13:17.111 --> 00:13:17.944
<v Speaker 1>something that people represent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as social cultures the same way a </v>

204
00:13:21.711 --> 00:13:22.544
<v Speaker 1>cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a culture regulates the way that you </v>

205
00:13:24.671 --> 00:13:27.580
<v Speaker 1>interact with each other and what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>expect from each other,</v>

206
00:13:27.581 --> 00:13:30.630
<v Speaker 1>and how you can fulfill your mutual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your needs in,</v>

207
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:34.630
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's represented.</v>

208
00:13:34.631 --> 00:13:38.440
<v Speaker 1>And the representation might help you </v>
<v Speaker 1>find meaning in your life.</v>

209
00:13:38.441 --> 00:13:41.290
<v Speaker 1>But the fact of the initial social </v>
<v Speaker 1>contract,</v>

210
00:13:41.291 --> 00:13:44.710
<v Speaker 1>which is the phenomena that regulates </v>
<v Speaker 1>your interpersonal behavior,</v>

211
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.460
<v Speaker 1>doesn't protect you from the fear of </v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

212
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.040
<v Speaker 1>It protects you from dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

213
00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.030
<v Speaker 1>and that's a very important thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>note.</v>

214
00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:52.601
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

215
00:13:52.601 --> 00:13:55.180
<v Speaker 1>all of you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course it's very cold out today.</v>

216
00:13:55.181 --> 00:13:56.014
<v Speaker 1>And yet here you are in this classroom </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's renal ridiculously </v>

217
00:13:59.711 --> 00:14:00.880
<v Speaker 1>comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

218
00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:05.350
<v Speaker 1>by classroom standards and of course by </v>
<v Speaker 1>standards around the world.</v>

219
00:14:05.351 --> 00:14:07.600
<v Speaker 1>And you're not freezing to death in </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

220
00:14:07.601 --> 00:14:11.020
<v Speaker 1>And that's not your belief that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>protecting you.</v>

221
00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.393
<v Speaker 1>It's the fact that you're embedded in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this insanely complicated system of </v>

222
00:14:15.761 --> 00:14:16.594
<v Speaker 1>cultural interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it just so happens that you get to </v>

223
00:14:18.971 --> 00:14:21.040
<v Speaker 1>sit here and listen to a lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

224
00:14:21.041 --> 00:14:25.000
<v Speaker 1>there's thousands of people beating </v>
<v Speaker 1>around many of them outside in the cold,</v>

225
00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.400
<v Speaker 1>making sure that the power grid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

226
00:14:27.401 --> 00:14:30.550
<v Speaker 1>that keeps this place warm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is properly maintained and functional,</v>

227
00:14:30.551 --> 00:14:31.384
<v Speaker 1>which takes a tremendous amount of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when in during periods of rapid </v>

228
00:14:36.101 --> 00:14:36.934
<v Speaker 1>transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for the social contract to </v>

229
00:14:39.311 --> 00:14:40.144
<v Speaker 1>adjust itself so that everyone knows how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to behave in relationship to one </v>

230
00:14:43.031 --> 00:14:43.300
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

231
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.450
<v Speaker 1>But then it's also very difficult for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the description of that.</v>

232
00:14:46.451 --> 00:14:49.930
<v Speaker 1>So the articulated norms that constitute</v>
<v Speaker 1>a society,</v>

233
00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:51.003
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult them to transform </v>
<v Speaker 1>rapidly enough so that they can keep </v>

234
00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:55.394
<v Speaker 1>track of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the changes and help people decide </v>

235
00:14:58.461 --> 00:15:03.260
<v Speaker 1>what they should do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me give you an example.</v>

236
00:15:03.261 --> 00:15:04.094
<v Speaker 1>So I had a client a while back who had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been raised as the fundamentalist </v>

237
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:11.290
<v Speaker 1>Christian and she was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

238
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.230
<v Speaker 1>she had been socialized and had come to </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that</v>

239
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:17.563
<v Speaker 1>sex before marriage was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the probability that she was going </v>

240
00:15:20.511 --> 00:15:25.511
<v Speaker 1>to get married before she was 27 or 28 </v>
<v Speaker 1>was low for a whole variety of reasons.</v>

241
00:15:26.361 --> 00:15:29.690
<v Speaker 1>And so then she faced this conundrum and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an interesting conundrum,</v>

242
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:34.750
<v Speaker 1>my perspective because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that in a well-regulated psyche,</v>

243
00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:36.523
<v Speaker 1>sexuality is integrated into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality so that it's so that it </v>

244
00:15:40.851 --> 00:15:41.684
<v Speaker 1>plays its role in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call in Nepal or the of </v>

245
00:15:44.991 --> 00:15:45.810
<v Speaker 1>the south.</v>

246
00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:50.330
<v Speaker 1>It's integrated properly inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's under moral control,</v>

247
00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:51.223
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking because it serves its </v>
<v Speaker 1>own function plus the function of </v>

248
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:56.683
<v Speaker 1>keeping the person well situated in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>present and developing property in the </v>

249
00:16:00.771 --> 00:16:04.190
<v Speaker 1>future and maintaining proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships with everyone around them.</v>

250
00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:05.593
<v Speaker 1>But it was quite obvious to me that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of the constraints that had been </v>

251
00:16:08.691 --> 00:16:12.380
<v Speaker 1>placed on her behavior as a consequence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of her relatively rigid belief,</v>

252
00:16:12.381 --> 00:16:15.080
<v Speaker 1>we're actually interfering with her </v>
<v Speaker 1>development as a person.</v>

253
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:16.543
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things we had to </v>

254
00:16:17.271 --> 00:16:18.440
<v Speaker 1>puzzle out was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

255
00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:19.903
<v Speaker 1>exactly what are the moral guidelines </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you should use to regulate your </v>

256
00:16:24.471 --> 00:16:25.304
<v Speaker 1>sexual behavior outside of marriage if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not planning to be married for </v>

257
00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.370
<v Speaker 1>maybe until your late twenties well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

258
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.340
<v Speaker 1>good luck trying to figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a really,</v>

259
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:35.690
<v Speaker 1>it's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

260
00:16:35.691 --> 00:16:37.610
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really complicated question.</v>

261
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:38.563
<v Speaker 1>And it's certainly not obvious that any </v>
<v Speaker 1>one person can figure out the answer to </v>

262
00:16:41.841 --> 00:16:44.450
<v Speaker 1>that in a single lifetime.</v>

263
00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they thought if nothing else,</v>

264
00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:48.343
<v Speaker 1>especially because of the landscape </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself is transforming as you're </v>

265
00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:53.150
<v Speaker 1>attempting to adjust to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

266
00:16:53.151 --> 00:16:53.984
<v Speaker 1>and we eventually concluded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it was a very individual </v>

267
00:16:57.441 --> 00:16:58.274
<v Speaker 1>solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we eventually concluded that there were </v>

268
00:16:59.511 --> 00:17:02.270
<v Speaker 1>things that she had forbidden herself to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

269
00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:03.104
<v Speaker 1>that we're stopping her from </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishing any kind of longterm </v>

270
00:17:05.901 --> 00:17:08.700
<v Speaker 1>relationship at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that that was interfering with their</v>

271
00:17:08.701 --> 00:17:09.534
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

272
00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:10.453
<v Speaker 1>as a mature person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that the morality that she had used </v>

273
00:17:13.671 --> 00:17:16.520
<v Speaker 1>to structure her behavior appeared to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>counterproductive,</v>

274
00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:17.570
<v Speaker 1>at least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

275
00:17:17.571 --> 00:17:19.700
<v Speaker 1>in some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some areas.</v>

276
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.610
<v Speaker 1>So it's one thing to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

277
00:17:22.611 --> 00:17:23.444
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to regulate sexuality in the hopes of </v>

278
00:17:26.271 --> 00:17:27.440
<v Speaker 1>marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you get married,</v>

279
00:17:27.441 --> 00:17:28.220
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

280
00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.053
<v Speaker 1>19 or 20 or 21 it's a completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>different thing when it's perhaps not </v>

281
00:17:31.851 --> 00:17:32.684
<v Speaker 1>going to happen until you're in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>late twenties so now need shit talked a </v>

282
00:17:38.871 --> 00:17:39.704
<v Speaker 1>lot and Dostoyevsky talked a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the collapse of meaning systems in the </v>

283
00:17:43.791 --> 00:17:47.470
<v Speaker 1>late 19th century and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was followed by a river,</v>

284
00:17:47.471 --> 00:17:49.100
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rapid period.</v>

285
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Technological transformation like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>really kicked in in the late 18 hundreds</v>

286
00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:53.850
<v Speaker 1>which was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

287
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.080
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

288
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.960
<v Speaker 1>was it the height of the industrial </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution,</v>

289
00:17:57.961 --> 00:18:02.070
<v Speaker 1>particularly in England.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there were modern technologies being</v>

290
00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:05.040
<v Speaker 1>thrust out of the industrial revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like mad,</v>

291
00:18:05.041 --> 00:18:09.450
<v Speaker 1>like the automobile or near playing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the electric light and recording devices</v>

292
00:18:09.451 --> 00:18:13.110
<v Speaker 1>and all of the things that we're still </v>
<v Speaker 1>elaborating on now.</v>

293
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.730
<v Speaker 1>And then of course,</v>

294
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:22.040
<v Speaker 1>apart from the collapse of classic say </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian belief and the introduction of</v>

295
00:18:22.681 --> 00:18:25.170
<v Speaker 1>all these new technologies when world </v>
<v Speaker 1>war one hit,</v>

296
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:29.010
<v Speaker 1>the entire monarchical structure of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Western world collapsed.</v>

297
00:18:29.011 --> 00:18:32.070
<v Speaker 1>And that also occurred say with regards </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the Ottoman Empire.</v>

298
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.970
<v Speaker 1>And that was partly what led to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>creation of the modern Middle East.</v>

299
00:18:35.971 --> 00:18:39.630
<v Speaker 1>And of course we're still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that still hasn't been sorted out to any</v>

300
00:18:39.631 --> 00:18:43.050
<v Speaker 1>great degree at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the monarchical structures collapsed.</v>

301
00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:44.363
<v Speaker 1>These ancient civilizations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russians underwent their revolution </v>

302
00:18:48.361 --> 00:18:49.191
<v Speaker 1>and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

303
00:18:49.191 --> 00:18:53.790
<v Speaker 1>and were transformed into communists and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then after World War One,</v>

304
00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.153
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stress between the potential </v>

305
00:18:57.781 --> 00:18:58.614
<v Speaker 1>different ways of structuring societies </v>
<v Speaker 1>after the monarchical societies had </v>

306
00:19:02.671 --> 00:19:07.020
<v Speaker 1>collapsed was almost unbearable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people didn't really know what to do.</v>

307
00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:08.123
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

308
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:08.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

309
00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:09.803
<v Speaker 1>What happened at the end of niches </v>
<v Speaker 1>period and m Dostoyevsky's period was </v>

310
00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:16.980
<v Speaker 1>that the question that both of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

311
00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:20.950
<v Speaker 2>what no</v>

312
00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.033
<v Speaker 1>most important question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of those people ask became the </v>

313
00:19:24.341 --> 00:19:25.174
<v Speaker 1>central focus of the development of </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical ideas of ethics in the </v>

314
00:19:29.081 --> 00:19:29.914
<v Speaker 1>20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could think about those as that </v>

315
00:19:31.321 --> 00:19:34.000
<v Speaker 1>has a kind of a post religious ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

316
00:19:34.001 --> 00:19:34.834
<v Speaker 1>the reason I'm telling you this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because among other things is because a </v>

317
00:19:38.801 --> 00:19:43.801
<v Speaker 1>lot of what cycle analytic or </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapeutic treatment is about,</v>

318
00:19:44.861 --> 00:19:45.694
<v Speaker 1>it's about ethics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that can't be stressed too much </v>

319
00:19:48.251 --> 00:19:51.730
<v Speaker 1>because ethics is about how you see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and how you behave.</v>

320
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:53.103
<v Speaker 1>And so even behaviorists who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>technically embedded in the scientific </v>

321
00:19:56.771 --> 00:20:00.740
<v Speaker 1>world are still pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>practical ethicist.</v>

322
00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:01.593
<v Speaker 1>Because what they're consistently doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with their clients is breaking down </v>

323
00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.290
<v Speaker 1>whatever the problems are that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>causing the misery,</v>

324
00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:09.603
<v Speaker 1>breaking them down into sub problems and</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out solutions that </v>

325
00:20:12.221 --> 00:20:14.620
<v Speaker 1>improve their quality of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like practical,</v>

326
00:20:14.621 --> 00:20:17.740
<v Speaker 1>implementable solutions that improve </v>
<v Speaker 1>their quality of life,</v>

327
00:20:17.741 --> 00:20:20.770
<v Speaker 1>not only now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as they propagate into the future.</v>

328
00:20:20.771 --> 00:20:24.490
<v Speaker 1>And that is not a scientific issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a how to live issue.</v>

329
00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.390
<v Speaker 1>So the entire history of the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

330
00:20:28.391 --> 00:20:29.650
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political,</v>

331
00:20:29.651 --> 00:20:30.484
<v Speaker 1>economic and psychological was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sequence of attempts to answer the </v>

332
00:20:36.011 --> 00:20:40.630
<v Speaker 1>question when your fundamental systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>of ethics collapse,</v>

333
00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.580
<v Speaker 1>how is it that you should live</v>

334
00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:43.690
<v Speaker 2>okay</v>

335
00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:48.580
<v Speaker 1>now Nisha said very clearly that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be two to the collapse of these</v>

336
00:20:48.581 --> 00:20:52.360
<v Speaker 1>systems and one would be nihilism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the belief and nothing at all,</v>

337
00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:56.590
<v Speaker 1>which he also regarded as a form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>escape from responsibility.</v>

338
00:20:56.591 --> 00:21:01.180
<v Speaker 1>So it's a logical consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>breakdown of classical belief systems,</v>

339
00:21:01.181 --> 00:21:02.014
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a a cop out and it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of cop out that dusty Husky </v>

340
00:21:06.011 --> 00:21:10.660
<v Speaker 1>explored very deeply in his small </v>
<v Speaker 1>resilient novel notes from underground,</v>

341
00:21:10.661 --> 00:21:15.310
<v Speaker 1>which describes a person who's basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>slipped and intellect intelligent person</v>

342
00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:16.293
<v Speaker 1>and an irresponsible person who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically slipped into a pit of </v>

343
00:21:19.061 --> 00:21:23.890
<v Speaker 1>meaninglessness where he experienced his</v>
<v Speaker 1>hatred and resentment and the desire for</v>

344
00:21:23.891 --> 00:21:24.724
<v Speaker 1>revenge and all of the sorts of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would afflict someone in the </v>

345
00:21:28.091 --> 00:21:31.420
<v Speaker 1>underworld who's got nothing to hold </v>
<v Speaker 1>them together.</v>

346
00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:32.883
<v Speaker 1>And then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature also talked about the likelihood </v>

347
00:21:35.891 --> 00:21:36.724
<v Speaker 1>that people would turn to totalitarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief systems such and he particularly </v>

348
00:21:40.151 --> 00:21:43.960
<v Speaker 1>discussed communism as a replacement for</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious belief.</v>

349
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.810
<v Speaker 1>I can give you a Canadian example of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

350
00:21:46.811 --> 00:21:51.811
<v Speaker 1>So I heard a Gallup pollster one time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at a conference in Ottawa.</v>

351
00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:55.810
<v Speaker 1>It's the only time I've ever heard this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's an amazing,</v>

352
00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:57.243
<v Speaker 1>it's an amazing fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were looking at the probability </v>

353
00:22:00.521 --> 00:22:02.950
<v Speaker 1>that people would be separatists in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Quebec.</v>

354
00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:04.293
<v Speaker 1>And if you are a lapsed Catholic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you will be a </v>

355
00:22:08.111 --> 00:22:12.460
<v Speaker 1>separate as was increased 10 times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is,</v>

356
00:22:12.461 --> 00:22:13.294
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catholicism fell apart in Quebec in the </v>

357
00:22:15.281 --> 00:22:20.260
<v Speaker 1>late 1950s it was one of the last places</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Western world,</v>

358
00:22:20.261 --> 00:22:22.540
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the,</v>

359
00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:23.793
<v Speaker 1>the feudal in some sense structures of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Catholicism had maintained themselves </v>

360
00:22:28.451 --> 00:22:29.284
<v Speaker 1>right up to that point right up to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>1950s late 1950s and that collapsed </v>

361
00:22:33.851 --> 00:22:34.684
<v Speaker 1>precipitously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like belief in Christianity had in </v>

362
00:22:37.301 --> 00:22:38.440
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

363
00:22:38.441 --> 00:22:42.250
<v Speaker 1>in the late say 1880s and what happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Quebec was,</v>

364
00:22:42.251 --> 00:22:44.170
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the birth rate plummeted.</v>

365
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.033
<v Speaker 1>I mean I did genetic research in Quebec </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the 1950s and before that it was </v>

366
00:22:49.181 --> 00:22:52.600
<v Speaker 1>very typical to see families of nine to </v>
<v Speaker 1>13 children.</v>

367
00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:55.810
<v Speaker 1>And of course by now Quebec has the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lowest birth rate.</v>

368
00:22:55.811 --> 00:22:58.390
<v Speaker 1>I believe in the Western world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's way below replacement.</v>

369
00:22:58.391 --> 00:23:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Everybody bailed out of the church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody gets married.</v>

370
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:04.390
<v Speaker 1>And if you were a separate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as if you were a lapsed Catholic,</v>

371
00:23:04.391 --> 00:23:06.650
<v Speaker 1>you are 10 times more likely to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate list.</v>

372
00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:09.970
<v Speaker 1>All that meant was that with Catholicism</v>
<v Speaker 1>fell apart,</v>

373
00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:11.403
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who still needed to have very </v>

374
00:23:13.511 --> 00:23:17.230
<v Speaker 1>structured belief systems just turned to</v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalism as a natural alternative.</v>

375
00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:18.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's part of what,</v>

376
00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:23.560
<v Speaker 1>that's part of what accounted for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rigidity and utopian,</v>

377
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:26.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the utopian,</v>

378
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:31.660
<v Speaker 1>the Utopian nature of the Quebec </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement towards independence.</v>

379
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.823
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember talking to one of my </v>

380
00:23:33.971 --> 00:23:34.900
<v Speaker 1>callings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

381
00:23:34.901 --> 00:23:36.190
<v Speaker 1>very intelligent person.</v>

382
00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.200
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

383
00:23:38.201 --> 00:23:39.034
<v Speaker 1>I asked him because at that point they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were predicting that if Quebec </v>

384
00:23:42.731 --> 00:23:43.564
<v Speaker 1>separated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Canadian dollar would fall to 40 </v>

385
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:46.603
<v Speaker 1>cents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>45 cents us something like that and be </v>

386
00:23:47.901 --> 00:23:50.210
<v Speaker 1>complete economic catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

387
00:23:50.211 --> 00:23:50.631
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

388
00:23:50.631 --> 00:23:51.464
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the predictions are that if Canada </v>

389
00:23:53.001 --> 00:23:53.834
<v Speaker 1>separates and first of all or Quebec </v>
<v Speaker 1>separates and no one would know how to </v>

390
00:23:56.841 --> 00:23:59.090
<v Speaker 1>do that is the Canadian economy will </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapse.</v>

391
00:23:59.091 --> 00:24:01.670
<v Speaker 1>And of course that will collapse the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Quebec economy too.</v>

392
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:02.881
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

393
00:24:02.881 --> 00:24:04.190
<v Speaker 1>he didn't deny that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

394
00:24:04.191 --> 00:24:05.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would be worth it.</v>

395
00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:07.101
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

396
00:24:07.101 --> 00:24:10.280
<v Speaker 1>there's just no way of having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation under those circumstances.</v>

397
00:24:10.281 --> 00:24:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Because from my perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>total,</v>

398
00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:13.743
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>severe economic collapse is a good </v>

399
00:24:15.111 --> 00:24:18.730
<v Speaker 1>reason not to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you believe that the pope,</v>

400
00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:23.210
<v Speaker 1>the future potential is such that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>justified,</v>

401
00:24:23.211 --> 00:24:25.340
<v Speaker 1>then well there's no arguing with you.</v>

402
00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:28.280
<v Speaker 1>It's just something that you've decided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the end of that.</v>

403
00:24:28.281 --> 00:24:30.980
<v Speaker 1>And when I lived in Quebec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I did for a long time,</v>

404
00:24:30.981 --> 00:24:31.814
<v Speaker 1>I learned very quickly never to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion about politics with anyone </v>

405
00:24:34.791 --> 00:24:35.624
<v Speaker 1>who was a separate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because it was just absolutely </v>

406
00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.840
<v Speaker 1>counterproductive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

407
00:24:38.841 --> 00:24:42.620
<v Speaker 1>they had axioms of belief that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>movable.</v>

408
00:24:42.621 --> 00:24:43.454
<v Speaker 1>Like the future will be good enough so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that no matter what price we pay in the </v>

409
00:24:46.251 --> 00:24:48.080
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will be justified.</v>

410
00:24:48.081 --> 00:24:49.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's not an idea.</v>

411
00:24:49.641 --> 00:24:51.380
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a statement of faith.</v>

412
00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:54.080
<v Speaker 1>And you saw a doctor the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>

413
00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:57.230
<v Speaker 1>not with the same principles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that,</v>

414
00:24:57.231 --> 00:24:58.064
<v Speaker 1>but you saw the same thing happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a psychological perspective in </v>

415
00:25:01.101 --> 00:25:02.810
<v Speaker 1>Russia when the Communists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

416
00:25:02.811 --> 00:25:03.644
<v Speaker 1>when the communists really started to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become active in the 1920s when any </v>

417
00:25:06.651 --> 00:25:07.484
<v Speaker 1>matter of horror whatsoever was fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>justifiable because it was going to </v>

418
00:25:10.611 --> 00:25:15.170
<v Speaker 1>bring about some future state that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically equivalent to paradise.</v>

419
00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.260
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

420
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:22.310
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dostoyevsky pursued the idea of nihilism</v>

421
00:25:22.311 --> 00:25:23.144
<v Speaker 1>even farther because Dostoyevsky was </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly someone who was willing to go </v>

422
00:25:26.121 --> 00:25:26.954
<v Speaker 1>to the ends of an argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things he proclaimed was </v>

423
00:25:30.171 --> 00:25:33.170
<v Speaker 1>that if there was no god than anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>was permitted.</v>

424
00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:34.333
<v Speaker 1>And his basic hypothesis was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well as if there's no all ultimate </v>

425
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:38.353
<v Speaker 1>arbiter of values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's no transcendent arbiter of </v>

426
00:25:41.361 --> 00:25:45.020
<v Speaker 1>values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're radically free.</v>

427
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.270
<v Speaker 1>Now the existentialists would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

428
00:25:47.271 --> 00:25:50.420
<v Speaker 1>you could use that radical freedom to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find meaning in your life.</v>

429
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:51.583
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things Dostoyevsky </v>
<v Speaker 1>realized was that you could use that </v>

430
00:25:54.381 --> 00:25:56.480
<v Speaker 1>radical freedom for anything that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted.</v>

431
00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:58.640
<v Speaker 1>And so in his book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crime and punishment,</v>

432
00:25:58.641 --> 00:26:03.110
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he explores the actions and beliefs of a</v>

433
00:26:03.111 --> 00:26:07.970
<v Speaker 1>student named Rascal Nacog and risk </v>
<v Speaker 1>called Nicole is a starving student.</v>

434
00:26:07.971 --> 00:26:10.580
<v Speaker 1>He's a law student and he doesn't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to eat.</v>

435
00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:11.413
<v Speaker 1>So of course he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his cognition is a little bit on the </v>

436
00:26:13.161 --> 00:26:17.420
<v Speaker 1>adult side because he's going through </v>
<v Speaker 1>periods of starvation and drunkenness.</v>

437
00:26:17.421 --> 00:26:18.254
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like he's thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly he wants to become a law </v>

438
00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.473
<v Speaker 1>students so that it can help society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he finds out that his sister is </v>

439
00:26:24.861 --> 00:26:25.694
<v Speaker 1>basically willing to enter into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>loveless marriage and more or less </v>

440
00:26:29.631 --> 00:26:30.464
<v Speaker 1>prostitute herself so that she can </v>
<v Speaker 1>generate enough money to share with her </v>

441
00:26:34.011 --> 00:26:37.580
<v Speaker 1>mother so that they can fund his </v>
<v Speaker 1>continuation through law school.</v>

442
00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.280
<v Speaker 1>And he thinks that wouldn't be a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>good deal.</v>

443
00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:45.600
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's indebted a pawn broker who everyone</v>

444
00:26:45.601 --> 00:26:48.450
<v Speaker 1>hates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is an absolutely miserable person in</v>

445
00:26:48.451 --> 00:26:49.284
<v Speaker 1>every possible way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Dostoevsky sets up the situation </v>

446
00:26:51.541 --> 00:26:54.330
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the pawn broker has a niece,</v>

447
00:26:54.331 --> 00:26:55.164
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who she basically in slaves and miss </v>

448
00:26:57.181 --> 00:26:58.014
<v Speaker 1>treats and she squat squirrels away all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of money but never does anything </v>

449
00:27:01.771 --> 00:27:03.480
<v Speaker 1>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives in absolute poverty.</v>

450
00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:04.313
<v Speaker 1>And anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he considers her the sort of person </v>

451
00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:09.930
<v Speaker 1>without whom the world would be a better</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

452
00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:14.130
<v Speaker 1>So having all of these things co </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurring in his imagination,</v>

453
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:19.160
<v Speaker 1>he decides that because there are no </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate arbiters of value,</v>

454
00:27:19.171 --> 00:27:21.810
<v Speaker 1>that all morality is essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>cowardice,</v>

455
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:25.710
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of the reverse of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to concluded.</v>

456
00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:27.053
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said most people were cowardly and </v>

457
00:27:28.411 --> 00:27:29.244
<v Speaker 1>justified that with their morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but responding to cough took the other </v>

458
00:27:32.281 --> 00:27:33.091
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

459
00:27:33.091 --> 00:27:33.924
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do I have to obey any rules at all </v>

460
00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.610
<v Speaker 1>if there's no ultimate source for any of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these rules,</v>

461
00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:43.170
<v Speaker 1>it's just convention and cowardice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I have enough strength,</v>

462
00:27:43.171 --> 00:27:46.500
<v Speaker 1>then I can leave outside of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>framework and I can do whatever I want.</v>

463
00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:51.890
<v Speaker 1>So he decides to kill the pawnbroker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he does and quite successfully.</v>

464
00:27:52.141 --> 00:27:52.974
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets away with it and that's about </v>

465
00:27:55.141 --> 00:27:56.940
<v Speaker 1>the first third of crime and punishment.</v>

466
00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:57.773
<v Speaker 1>And the rest of the book is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion of the manner in which he </v>

467
00:28:01.321 --> 00:28:05.190
<v Speaker 1>comes unglued as a consequence of having</v>
<v Speaker 1>performed this act.</v>

468
00:28:05.191 --> 00:28:06.990
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a brilliant,</v>

469
00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:08.003
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely brilliant study of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that a value system holds you </v>

470
00:28:13.771 --> 00:28:16.260
<v Speaker 1>together even in ways that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

471
00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:18.770
<v Speaker 1>And then if you step outside of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

472
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:19.663
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and violate your relationship to it in </v>

473
00:28:21.541 --> 00:28:22.374
<v Speaker 1>some really intense way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's going to be catastrophic </v>

474
00:28:25.681 --> 00:28:28.850
<v Speaker 1>psychological consequences that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>echo through your whole being.</v>

475
00:28:28.851 --> 00:28:29.684
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that this is more than theory </v>

476
00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.353
<v Speaker 1>because many people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers in particular who developed </v>

477
00:28:36.011 --> 00:28:39.870
<v Speaker 1>post traumatic stress disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed post traumatic stress disorder</v>

478
00:28:39.871 --> 00:28:40.704
<v Speaker 1>when they observe themselves doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that they regard as </v>

479
00:28:44.161 --> 00:28:47.160
<v Speaker 1>tremendously cruel or vicious or </v>
<v Speaker 1>immoral.</v>

480
00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:49.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're in the situation where,</v>

481
00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:50.933
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

482
00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:54.690
<v Speaker 1>acting that acting in that manner is </v>
<v Speaker 1>highly probable.</v>

483
00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:57.990
<v Speaker 1>It's a war situation is usually very </v>
<v Speaker 1>intense and you know,</v>

484
00:28:57.991 --> 00:29:01.620
<v Speaker 1>they don't have a lot of time to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions and God only knows,</v>

485
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:04.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the specifics are of the particular</v>

486
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:06.450
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But many,</v>

487
00:29:06.451 --> 00:29:07.284
<v Speaker 1>many people come to be so shattered by </v>
<v Speaker 1>observing themselves do things they </v>

488
00:29:12.211 --> 00:29:15.150
<v Speaker 1>can't believe that a human being would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be capable of doing that.</v>

489
00:29:15.151 --> 00:29:18.100
<v Speaker 1>They never recovered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's partly because you know,</v>

490
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:21.450
<v Speaker 1>they violate their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their ethical,</v>

491
00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:26.190
<v Speaker 1>the ethical structure that holds them </v>
<v Speaker 1>together holds older ideas and their,</v>

492
00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:30.750
<v Speaker 1>their plans and their perceptions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their interactions with other people.</v>

493
00:29:30.751 --> 00:29:35.340
<v Speaker 1>That's a unified field in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you violate it and it fragments,</v>

494
00:29:35.341 --> 00:29:38.030
<v Speaker 1>then you're left absolutely fragmented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then that's,</v>

495
00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:38.913
<v Speaker 1>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not even a psychological </v>

496
00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:43.750
<v Speaker 1>observation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a psychophysiological observation.</v>

497
00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:44.643
<v Speaker 1>You can stress yourself so badly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raise your stress level so high that </v>

498
00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:51.640
<v Speaker 1>your brain starts to become damaged by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stress hormones.</v>

499
00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.990
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

500
00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:56.380
<v Speaker 1>it's not just a psychological state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

501
00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.740
<v Speaker 1>it's damage to the core of your being in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense.</v>

502
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the collapse of these belief systems and</v>

503
00:30:06.101 --> 00:30:06.934
<v Speaker 1>their destabilization was well thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>through by these thinkers by the end of </v>

504
00:30:10.721 --> 00:30:11.554
<v Speaker 1>the 19th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then w we have the technological </v>

505
00:30:13.811 --> 00:30:14.644
<v Speaker 1>transformations and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the sociological and political </v>

506
00:30:18.401 --> 00:30:20.920
<v Speaker 1>transformations of the early part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>20th century.</v>

507
00:30:20.921 --> 00:30:25.360
<v Speaker 1>That leaves everyone in a state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>confusion in some sense.</v>

508
00:30:25.361 --> 00:30:26.194
<v Speaker 1>Like in Germany in the 1920s of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Germans had gone through this </v>

509
00:30:30.131 --> 00:30:33.070
<v Speaker 1>terrible period of trench warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're all,</v>

510
00:30:33.071 --> 00:30:33.904
<v Speaker 1>their men were brutalized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them had been on the front for </v>

511
00:30:35.681 --> 00:30:37.630
<v Speaker 1>months and that was in the trenches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

512
00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:40.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their political system had collapsed and</v>

513
00:30:40.091 --> 00:30:43.090
<v Speaker 1>they put a week weekly rooted democracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>in place.</v>

514
00:30:43.091 --> 00:30:45.310
<v Speaker 1>And then the economic system collapsed </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Germany,</v>

515
00:30:45.311 --> 00:30:46.960
<v Speaker 1>went through a period of hyperinflation.</v>

516
00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:47.793
<v Speaker 1>So that money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the value of their money basically </v>

517
00:30:50.291 --> 00:30:51.124
<v Speaker 1>dropped to zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that meant that if you were 65 </v>

518
00:30:54.311 --> 00:30:55.144
<v Speaker 1>years old and had saved up your whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>life to have enough money to retire and </v>

519
00:30:58.211 --> 00:30:59.650
<v Speaker 1>we're a good citizen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

520
00:30:59.651 --> 00:31:01.060
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and prudent and careful,</v>

521
00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:04.570
<v Speaker 1>every single thing you ever own </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappeared.</v>

522
00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.450
<v Speaker 1>And so at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

523
00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:08.573
<v Speaker 1>the communist revolution had taken place</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Soviet Russia and there was great </v>

524
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:15.220
<v Speaker 1>concern within Germany that the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing was likely to happen there.</v>

525
00:31:15.221 --> 00:31:20.221
<v Speaker 1>And certainly that the communists were </v>
<v Speaker 1>always pushing for that because they had</v>

526
00:31:20.561 --> 00:31:21.394
<v Speaker 1>the common term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the international communist </v>

527
00:31:22.991 --> 00:31:23.824
<v Speaker 1>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was devoted towards the </v>

528
00:31:24.981 --> 00:31:26.820
<v Speaker 1>stabilizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

529
00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:27.663
<v Speaker 1>non communist governments and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and producing the preconditions for the </v>

530
00:31:30.911 --> 00:31:31.770
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't,</v>

531
00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:34.480
<v Speaker 1>wasn't like it was just paranoia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a real threat.</v>

532
00:31:34.481 --> 00:31:36.880
<v Speaker 1>And it was out of all that mess that </v>
<v Speaker 1>came,</v>

533
00:31:36.881 --> 00:31:39.250
<v Speaker 1>the emergence of the fascists and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazis.</v>

534
00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:40.880
<v Speaker 1>And it's not that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

535
00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:41.743
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that surprising because chaos </v>

536
00:31:43.841 --> 00:31:47.560
<v Speaker 1>breeds the desire for order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that was what,</v>

537
00:31:47.561 --> 00:31:50.380
<v Speaker 1>that was one direction that people could</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

538
00:31:50.381 --> 00:31:51.214
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of following an abstract </v>

539
00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:53.770
<v Speaker 1>Messiah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

540
00:31:53.771 --> 00:31:57.670
<v Speaker 1>the sort of of idea that was embedded in</v>
<v Speaker 1>classical Christianity,</v>

541
00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:01.000
<v Speaker 1>they realized the new Messiah not was </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler.</v>

542
00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:03.580
<v Speaker 1>And that certainly didn't seem to be any</v>
<v Speaker 1>improvement,</v>

543
00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.073
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Hitler was really a messiah of </v>

544
00:32:06.581 --> 00:32:07.414
<v Speaker 1>destruction and fire and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the World War II who killed about 120 </v>

545
00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:12.723
<v Speaker 1>million people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course it left Germany in </v>

546
00:32:13.631 --> 00:32:14.464
<v Speaker 1>absolute ruins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Hitler killed himself in his bunker </v>

547
00:32:16.841 --> 00:32:17.674
<v Speaker 1>underneath Berlin while it was burning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Russians were advancing into </v>

548
00:32:20.201 --> 00:32:20.891
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

549
00:32:20.891 --> 00:32:25.891
<v Speaker 1>into Germany and they were not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't want to be a German national.</v>

550
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:27.063
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Soviets were advancing towards you </v>

551
00:32:28.451 --> 00:32:30.700
<v Speaker 1>after your con,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after your country to invaded.</v>

552
00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:33.910
<v Speaker 1>There's push them back halfway across </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union,</v>

553
00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:35.163
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and produced a tremendous amount of </v>

554
00:32:36.551 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 1>damage and distress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was an situation,</v>

555
00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:41.743
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

556
00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.033
<v Speaker 1>the Messiah is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the Russians turned to Lenin and </v>

557
00:32:46.641 --> 00:32:51.410
<v Speaker 1>Stalin were barbaric and brutal be on </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehension.</v>

558
00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.011
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

559
00:32:52.011 --> 00:32:54.110
<v Speaker 1>it's a strange thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

560
00:32:54.111 --> 00:32:57.020
<v Speaker 1>we're not very well educated in what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened in this,</v>

561
00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:57.913
<v Speaker 1>in the Soviet Union in the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know far more about what happened in </v>

562
00:33:01.341 --> 00:33:03.110
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say with the Holocaust.</v>

563
00:33:03.111 --> 00:33:03.944
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very important that people should </v>

564
00:33:05.391 --> 00:33:06.224
<v Speaker 1>know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there were tens of millions of </v>

565
00:33:07.881 --> 00:33:10.850
<v Speaker 1>people brutally destroyed in the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union.</v>

566
00:33:10.851 --> 00:33:11.684
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because they were murdered by </v>

567
00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:17.780
<v Speaker 1>people who were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle,</v>

568
00:33:17.781 --> 00:33:22.670
<v Speaker 1>motivated by left wing Utopian visions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We seem to,</v>

569
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:27.200
<v Speaker 1>our education system seems to regard </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as somehow more forgivable,</v>

570
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:30.350
<v Speaker 1>which it certainly isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

571
00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:32.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole,</v>

572
00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:33.133
<v Speaker 1>the whole generate second or </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternatives to religious belief issue </v>

573
00:33:36.711 --> 00:33:38.240
<v Speaker 1>didn't seem to work out very well.</v>

574
00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:43.160
<v Speaker 1>And then the nihilism alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that has its own problems.</v>

575
00:33:43.161 --> 00:33:43.994
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one problem is the sort of dusty Esky </v>

576
00:33:46.461 --> 00:33:47.330
<v Speaker 1>talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

577
00:33:47.331 --> 00:33:49.790
<v Speaker 1>and you see the kids who go up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot,</v>

578
00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:53.720
<v Speaker 1>shoot up high schools and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and exploded in rage.</v>

579
00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.033
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're often people who feel that they </v>

580
00:33:56.241 --> 00:33:57.074
<v Speaker 1>have no meaning in their life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that life itself was contemptible and </v>

581
00:33:59.271 --> 00:34:01.760
<v Speaker 1>that suffering is too extreme and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

582
00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:02.690
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

583
00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.960
<v Speaker 1>they bear the brunt of unfair reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

584
00:34:05.961 --> 00:34:10.961
<v Speaker 1>they develop unbelievably dark and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and destructive theories of,</v>

585
00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:16.250
<v Speaker 1>of revenge and may ham over sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the period of years.</v>

586
00:34:16.251 --> 00:34:18.980
<v Speaker 1>And then they go up in the world and lay</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things out.</v>

587
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:22.430
<v Speaker 1>And it's not like they're thinking is </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrational,</v>

588
00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:24.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's coherent.</v>

589
00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:28.820
<v Speaker 1>It's just predicated on principles that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might not agree with such as,</v>

590
00:34:28.821 --> 00:34:30.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the principle that everyone that I don't</v>

591
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:32.060
<v Speaker 1>like deserves to die.</v>

592
00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:36.740
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the absence of a really formal way of</v>

593
00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:42.020
<v Speaker 1>demonstrating that such thoughts are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>only immoral but wrong,</v>

594
00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:42.883
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some absolute sense it's very </v>

595
00:34:43.971 --> 00:34:44.804
<v Speaker 1>difficult to come up with ways of </v>
<v Speaker 1>defending ourselves against those two </v>

596
00:34:47.811 --> 00:34:48.690
<v Speaker 1>extremes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

597
00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:53.660
<v Speaker 1>the extremes of destructive vitalism and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the extremes of ideological possession.</v>

598
00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:58.250
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature started to work out some,</v>

599
00:34:58.340 --> 00:34:59.173
<v Speaker 1>some solutions to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just started to touch on those at </v>

600
00:35:02.151 --> 00:35:04.460
<v Speaker 1>the end of the last lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

601
00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:06.973
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dostoyevsky solution was a return to </v>

602
00:35:08.961 --> 00:35:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Christianity fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's revivification.</v>

603
00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:12.763
<v Speaker 1>And that was the same tack that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn attempted to lay </v>

604
00:35:16.761 --> 00:35:19.660
<v Speaker 1>out and also tolstoy in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

605
00:35:19.661 --> 00:35:21.560
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll talk to you about that a little</v>

606
00:35:21.561 --> 00:35:22.394
<v Speaker 1>bit more in the next lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dusty or niches idea was that people </v>

607
00:35:25.551 --> 00:35:26.780
<v Speaker 1>would have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

608
00:35:26.781 --> 00:35:27.614
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when his quote about the death of God </v>

609
00:35:28.641 --> 00:35:29.474
<v Speaker 1>that people would have to become light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God's just to be able to tolerate the </v>

610
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:39.450
<v Speaker 1>consequences of this dismemberment of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the previous civilization.</v>

611
00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:42.490
<v Speaker 1>And he believed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

612
00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.630
<v Speaker 1>his thinking on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say is,</v>

613
00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:46.440
<v Speaker 1>is somewhat fragmentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

614
00:35:46.441 --> 00:35:49.890
<v Speaker 1>nature was a great critic of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity,</v>

615
00:35:49.891 --> 00:35:53.280
<v Speaker 1>institutionalized Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a great diagnostician.</v>

616
00:35:53.281 --> 00:35:54.114
<v Speaker 1>He could say what was rotten at the core</v>
<v Speaker 1>of western civilization will say modern </v>

617
00:35:58.681 --> 00:35:59.514
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when it came to actually describing </v>

618
00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.440
<v Speaker 1>what to do about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

619
00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:06.360
<v Speaker 1>he didn't live that long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

620
00:36:06.361 --> 00:36:07.194
<v Speaker 1>he died a fairly young man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's actually a video of nature in </v>

621
00:36:09.631 --> 00:36:12.690
<v Speaker 1>the mental hospital online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just found it the other night.</v>

622
00:36:12.691 --> 00:36:15.540
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea that he was ever a </v>
<v Speaker 1>captured on video.</v>

623
00:36:15.541 --> 00:36:20.541
<v Speaker 1>But there's video from movie from 1899 </v>
<v Speaker 1>showing him in the mental hospital where</v>

624
00:36:20.971 --> 00:36:25.971
<v Speaker 1>he ended up in his early forties so he </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about the development of the,</v>

625
00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:29.620
<v Speaker 1>of the being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He called the over man,</v>

626
00:36:29.621 --> 00:36:30.454
<v Speaker 1>which is often translated as super band.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his idea was that people would have </v>

627
00:36:35.341 --> 00:36:38.280
<v Speaker 1>to take onto themselves the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

628
00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:39.173
<v Speaker 1>the burden of creating new systems of </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning and new morality's that were </v>

629
00:36:43.081 --> 00:36:43.914
<v Speaker 1>suited to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they would have to create new </v>

630
00:36:46.111 --> 00:36:46.950
<v Speaker 1>values.</v>

631
00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:52.980
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young took niches,</v>

632
00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:55.800
<v Speaker 1>diagnosis very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very seriously.</v>

633
00:36:55.801 --> 00:36:56.634
<v Speaker 1>And you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can certainly say that Ewan was as </v>

634
00:36:58.471 --> 00:37:00.920
<v Speaker 1>much influenced by niche as he was by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud.</v>

635
00:37:00.921 --> 00:37:01.754
<v Speaker 1>And I would say in some ways he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced more because one of the </v>

636
00:37:04.861 --> 00:37:09.861
<v Speaker 1>things that yoga was trying to do was to</v>
<v Speaker 1>identify where the lost values had gone.</v>

637
00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:11.843
<v Speaker 1>So the Nietzsche and idea is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible for human beings to create </v>

638
00:37:16.471 --> 00:37:17.304
<v Speaker 1>their own values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a problem with that and </v>

639
00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:24.750
<v Speaker 1>there's a variety of problems with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one is that it's,</v>

640
00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:29.790
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem exactly true in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

641
00:37:29.791 --> 00:37:30.624
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of the existentialists who </v>

642
00:37:31.681 --> 00:37:34.320
<v Speaker 1>followed feature like John Paul Sartre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

643
00:37:34.321 --> 00:37:37.560
<v Speaker 1>believed in the radical freedom of human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings that we were,</v>

644
00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:42.710
<v Speaker 1>we were doomed to be free in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was absolutely necessary for us</v>

645
00:37:43.321 --> 00:37:44.154
<v Speaker 1>to conjure up our own meanings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>values because fundamentally we faced </v>

646
00:37:47.611 --> 00:37:48.170
<v Speaker 1>the void.</v>

647
00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:50.850
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life was nasty,</v>

648
00:37:50.851 --> 00:37:51.684
<v Speaker 1>brutish and short to use hobbs terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that we had to be able to confront </v>

649
00:37:55.141 --> 00:37:59.520
<v Speaker 1>that and live despite it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And well,</v>

650
00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:01.950
<v Speaker 1>there's a variety of problems with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution.</v>

651
00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.330
<v Speaker 1>The first one is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

652
00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:05.370
<v Speaker 1>if you come up with your system of </v>
<v Speaker 1>values,</v>

653
00:38:05.371 --> 00:38:07.860
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I come up with mine,</v>

654
00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:12.630
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason to assume that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be sufficiently integratable so</v>

655
00:38:12.631 --> 00:38:14.850
<v Speaker 1>that we don't have to fight each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the death.</v>

656
00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.350
<v Speaker 1>That's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

657
00:38:16.351 --> 00:38:19.980
<v Speaker 1>you'd have every single person with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own system of beliefs.</v>

658
00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:21.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine extent.</v>

659
00:38:21.481 --> 00:38:23.250
<v Speaker 1>How do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a sense,</v>

660
00:38:23.251 --> 00:38:26.010
<v Speaker 1>that's a structured kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical anarchy.</v>

661
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:27.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

662
00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.270
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's good if you happen to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone on an island,</v>

663
00:38:30.271 --> 00:38:32.580
<v Speaker 1>but if you're stuck with all these other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

664
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:34.920
<v Speaker 1>then that becomes a very difficult thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

665
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:39.760
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's partly for that reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Sartre famously said,</v>

666
00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:42.430
<v Speaker 1>hell is other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

667
00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:43.263
<v Speaker 1>Because he thought of the other in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense that which was not him as an </v>

668
00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:47.593
<v Speaker 1>oppressive force that stopped him from </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifesting his destiny in the way that </v>

669
00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:53.530
<v Speaker 1>would it be best for him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

670
00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell might be other people,</v>

671
00:38:56.651 --> 00:38:59.470
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

672
00:38:59.471 --> 00:39:00.304
<v Speaker 1>that's a very one sided way of looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>at things because of course hell is </v>

673
00:39:03.011 --> 00:39:04.900
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hell is you two.</v>

674
00:39:04.901 --> 00:39:06.820
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell is nature.</v>

675
00:39:06.821 --> 00:39:08.800
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of places you can find </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell.</v>

676
00:39:08.801 --> 00:39:11.170
<v Speaker 1>But by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

677
00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.273
<v Speaker 1>the most meaningful elements of people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives are often their social </v>

678
00:39:15.341 --> 00:39:18.370
<v Speaker 1>relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can't lay everything at the door</v>

679
00:39:18.371 --> 00:39:20.650
<v Speaker 1>of pathological society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

680
00:39:20.651 --> 00:39:23.590
<v Speaker 1>and we shouldn't forget as well that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sartre didn't,</v>

681
00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.133
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what come up with any reasonable </v>

682
00:39:27.911 --> 00:39:31.030
<v Speaker 1>critique of the communists until the </v>
<v Speaker 1>late 1960s.</v>

683
00:39:31.031 --> 00:39:31.481
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

684
00:39:31.481 --> 00:39:32.770
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was a little late.</v>

685
00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:33.663
<v Speaker 1>People with any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like George Orwell had figured out that </v>

686
00:39:36.371 --> 00:39:41.371
<v Speaker 1>the whole Soviet experiment had become </v>
<v Speaker 1>radically murderous by the early 1940s.</v>

687
00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:44.530
<v Speaker 1>And so starcher pr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

688
00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:48.430
<v Speaker 1>proposed radical freedom as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

689
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:54.100
<v Speaker 1>as the existential response to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unveiling of no meaning.</v>

690
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:58.180
<v Speaker 1>But when it came right down to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't resist identification with a</v>

691
00:39:58.181 --> 00:39:59.014
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't see any reason why we should </v>

692
00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:03.400
<v Speaker 1>really pay any attention to what he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say.</v>

693
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:08.950
<v Speaker 1>So now there's another problem with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that people should create their own</v>

694
00:40:08.951 --> 00:40:11.920
<v Speaker 1>values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is that it's not so simple.</v>

695
00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:13.443
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem seems to be is that you </v>

696
00:40:14.891 --> 00:40:17.560
<v Speaker 1>don't obey yourself very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

697
00:40:17.561 --> 00:40:18.700
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

698
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:21.160
<v Speaker 1>here's my code.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to live by it.</v>

699
00:40:21.161 --> 00:40:21.994
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we let's do that simply to begin </v>

700
00:40:23.441 --> 00:40:24.011
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

701
00:40:24.011 --> 00:40:27.700
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to study very hard and do well</v>

702
00:40:27.701 --> 00:40:30.340
<v Speaker 1>at my classes just for the sake of </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument that you know,</v>

703
00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:32.290
<v Speaker 1>but you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

704
00:40:32.291 --> 00:40:33.124
<v Speaker 1>you procrastinate and you have a paper </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to read and you know </v>

705
00:40:35.621 --> 00:40:36.454
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to read it and you need </v>
<v Speaker 1>to read it for reasons that are even </v>

706
00:40:39.101 --> 00:40:40.480
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically important to you.</v>

707
00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:43.570
<v Speaker 1>But there's no damn way you could get </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to sit down and read it.</v>

708
00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:48.400
<v Speaker 1>Your attention wanders and you go to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>three or four stupid things and you feel</v>

709
00:40:48.401 --> 00:40:49.234
<v Speaker 1>terrible about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you feel like you're betraying </v>

710
00:40:50.741 --> 00:40:53.500
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe this is a continual pattern in</v>

711
00:40:53.501 --> 00:40:54.334
<v Speaker 1>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things you find out is </v>

712
00:40:55.991 --> 00:40:56.824
<v Speaker 1>that you don't get to create your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn values because for some reason </v>

713
00:41:00.071 --> 00:41:02.560
<v Speaker 1>you're not in charge of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

714
00:41:02.561 --> 00:41:05.140
<v Speaker 1>that's where the psychoanalytic ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to come from.</v>

715
00:41:05.141 --> 00:41:06.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud notices.</v>

716
00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:07.353
<v Speaker 1>This is in the aftermath of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're not the master of your own </v>

717
00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:12.490
<v Speaker 1>psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that there's,</v>

718
00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:17.640
<v Speaker 1>there's many sub use inside of you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't all want the same thing.</v>

719
00:41:17.831 --> 00:41:22.270
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that you can generate </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own meaning is very,</v>

720
00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:23.393
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's insufficiently developed idea </v>

721
00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:30.840
<v Speaker 1>because there's a lot of meaning making </v>
<v Speaker 1>generators residing within you.</v>

722
00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.630
<v Speaker 1>And not only do they not all point in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same direction,</v>

723
00:41:35.631 --> 00:41:39.260
<v Speaker 1>which is a huge problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't even necessarily,</v>

724
00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:40.153
<v Speaker 1>they don't necessarily lay themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>out in some integrated fashion across </v>

725
00:41:43.791 --> 00:41:48.440
<v Speaker 1>time and they don't necessarily operate </v>
<v Speaker 1>together in a way that's going to enable</v>

726
00:41:48.441 --> 00:41:51.410
<v Speaker 1>you to find your place with other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in society.</v>

727
00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:54.740
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make your own meaning.</v>

728
00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:56.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which part of you,</v>

729
00:41:56.451 --> 00:41:58.550
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not a unified thing.</v>

730
00:41:58.700 --> 00:41:59.533
<v Speaker 1>So that's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all these other problems just </v>

731
00:42:02.451 --> 00:42:04.820
<v Speaker 1>remain unaddressed completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

732
00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:05.683
<v Speaker 1>one answer to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the answer that the more </v>

733
00:42:08.001 --> 00:42:12.710
<v Speaker 1>radical existentialist took as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Society has to be reconfigured.</v>

734
00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:15.860
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we kind of know where that leads to when</v>

735
00:42:15.861 --> 00:42:18.950
<v Speaker 1>people are doing radical societal </v>
<v Speaker 1>reconfiguration,</v>

736
00:42:18.951 --> 00:42:21.020
<v Speaker 1>at least as far as we've been able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell.</v>

737
00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:21.973
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an absolute murderous </v>

738
00:42:24.231 --> 00:42:25.250
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe.</v>

739
00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:27.230
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

740
00:42:27.231 --> 00:42:28.064
<v Speaker 1>it's reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems reasonable to me to presume </v>

741
00:42:29.931 --> 00:42:31.880
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that those experiments have already been</v>

742
00:42:31.881 --> 00:42:34.580
<v Speaker 1>run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

743
00:42:34.581 --> 00:42:35.414
<v Speaker 1>so now une,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Dostoyevsky was very interested in </v>

744
00:42:40.011 --> 00:42:40.844
<v Speaker 1>returning to sources of meaning from </v>
<v Speaker 1>which he believed that our original </v>

745
00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:46.723
<v Speaker 1>religious ideas had emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is partly his notion of the </v>

746
00:42:49.251 --> 00:42:51.380
<v Speaker 1>collective unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

747
00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:52.513
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the radical critique of </v>

748
00:42:55.191 --> 00:42:56.024
<v Speaker 1>religious systems is predicated on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that there's something like </v>

749
00:42:58.941 --> 00:43:00.350
<v Speaker 1>conscious beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

750
00:43:00.351 --> 00:43:04.610
<v Speaker 1>they're articulated beliefs that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could lay out in a credo,</v>

751
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:06.800
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not right.</v>

752
00:43:06.801 --> 00:43:08.630
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem to be correct at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Neat.</v>

753
00:43:08.631 --> 00:43:09.464
<v Speaker 1>She actually knew this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knew that a lot of our social </v>

754
00:43:11.481 --> 00:43:16.481
<v Speaker 1>institutions had emerged from the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and had only become articulated after</v>

755
00:43:16.791 --> 00:43:18.710
<v Speaker 1>they'd been embodied in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>danced out.</v>

756
00:43:18.711 --> 00:43:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

757
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:20.743
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are a tribal group learns how to </v>

758
00:43:23.331 --> 00:43:24.164
<v Speaker 1>organize itself over thousands and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years of trial and error </v>

759
00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:29.150
<v Speaker 1>and pushing against each other and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>

760
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:29.983
<v Speaker 1>And they come into that tribal grouping </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a biological substrate and there </v>

761
00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:34.683
<v Speaker 1>are sociological and political </v>
<v Speaker 1>interactions are constrained by all of </v>

762
00:43:38.811 --> 00:43:39.644
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe they come up with a </v>

763
00:43:40.821 --> 00:43:41.654
<v Speaker 1>description of that over time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the self description and an articulated </v>

764
00:43:44.871 --> 00:43:47.780
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the religious system.</v>

765
00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:49.153
<v Speaker 1>It's not that the religious system is </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought up first as a system of </v>

766
00:43:52.821 --> 00:43:55.850
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical presuppositions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>images and dreams,</v>

767
00:43:55.970 --> 00:44:00.590
<v Speaker 1>then turn it into rules then imposed on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the population who then obeys it.</v>

768
00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:03.440
<v Speaker 1>And generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people criticized,</v>

769
00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>formal religion,</v>

770
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:07.063
<v Speaker 1>they criticized it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assuming that that's how it had </v>

771
00:44:09.111 --> 00:44:09.861
<v Speaker 1>developed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

772
00:44:09.861 --> 00:44:12.140
<v Speaker 1>and that's kind of a Marxist idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

773
00:44:12.141 --> 00:44:14.510
<v Speaker 1>that religion is the opiate of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>masses and that,</v>

774
00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:15.793
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the religious structures were laid out </v>

775
00:44:17.511 --> 00:44:20.330
<v Speaker 1>so that a small elite could control the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

776
00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

777
00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:26.950
<v Speaker 1>in virtually every domain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a small elite emerges that dominates the</v>

778
00:44:27.591 --> 00:44:30.140
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what domain you look at.</v>

779
00:44:30.141 --> 00:44:33.960
<v Speaker 1>So mark's is accurate in that way in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

780
00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:38.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always a power imbalance between</v>

781
00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:38.943
<v Speaker 1>elite minority and a non elite majority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to say that that's the cause of all </v>

782
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:49.680
<v Speaker 1>the systems that people interact with it</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

783
00:44:49.681 --> 00:44:50.514
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

784
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:53.120
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sophisticated beyond belief.</v>

785
00:44:53.121 --> 00:44:53.954
<v Speaker 1>What it does is it takes phenomena that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are complex beyond comprehension and </v>

786
00:44:57.351 --> 00:44:59.660
<v Speaker 1>reduce them to one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not helpful.</v>

787
00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:00.620
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

788
00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:01.610
<v Speaker 1>here's an example.</v>

789
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:04.263
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

790
00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:09.820
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you sampled popular songs on the,</v>

791
00:45:09.821 --> 00:45:10.654
<v Speaker 1>on Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you made a graph of how </v>

792
00:45:11.981 --> 00:45:12.814
<v Speaker 1>popular songs were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you find is that about 10 songs at </v>

793
00:45:16.451 --> 00:45:19.570
<v Speaker 1>any given time are played.</v>

794
00:45:21.310 --> 00:45:22.143
<v Speaker 1>Half of all the songs played at any </v>
<v Speaker 1>given time are going to be one of 10 </v>

795
00:45:25.301 --> 00:45:27.190
<v Speaker 1>songs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

796
00:45:27.191 --> 00:45:28.024
<v Speaker 1>and then what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing you'd find is that half </v>

797
00:45:29.111 --> 00:45:34.111
<v Speaker 1>of all songs played are played by one or</v>
<v Speaker 1>more of 10 musicians.</v>

798
00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:36.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter,</v>

799
00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:36.873
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look all the way from the 1930s </v>

800
00:45:38.231 --> 00:45:40.120
<v Speaker 1>to now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at popular music,</v>

801
00:45:40.121 --> 00:45:40.954
<v Speaker 1>you see the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost everything that almost everyone </v>

802
00:45:43.541 --> 00:45:46.600
<v Speaker 1>listens to is created by very few </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

803
00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:51.880
<v Speaker 1>And then there's millions of musicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've never heard of most of them.</v>

804
00:45:51.881 --> 00:45:53.610
<v Speaker 1>And you'll never hear a song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For most,</v>

805
00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:54.933
<v Speaker 1>it's a small minority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you see as in any field of </v>

806
00:45:56.951 --> 00:45:59.410
<v Speaker 1>creative production,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this happens.</v>

807
00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:03.880
<v Speaker 1>A small elite emerges and dominates the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire landscape.</v>

808
00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:06.520
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

809
00:46:06.521 --> 00:46:08.890
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be kind of ridiculous to assume</v>

810
00:46:08.891 --> 00:46:09.724
<v Speaker 1>that the 10 most popular singers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>musicians that are currently operative </v>

811
00:46:14.111 --> 00:46:14.944
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those who gave rise to the system that </v>

812
00:46:16.601 --> 00:46:18.070
<v Speaker 1>allowed them to thrive.</v>

813
00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:21.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously that's a dopey idea and it's,</v>

814
00:46:21.611 --> 00:46:22.360
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

815
00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:23.193
<v Speaker 1>it's no more an intelligent idea of when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at any other domain where </v>

816
00:46:26.411 --> 00:46:30.010
<v Speaker 1>there's tremendous variation and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>emergence of an elite,</v>

817
00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:32.590
<v Speaker 1>it's a very common phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens,</v>

818
00:46:32.591 --> 00:46:34.210
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happens anywhere.</v>

819
00:46:34.211 --> 00:46:37.570
<v Speaker 1>There's creative production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why 1% of the people,</v>

820
00:46:37.571 --> 00:46:38.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly half,</v>

821
00:46:38.471 --> 00:46:42.520
<v Speaker 1>50% of the money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no different than in other creative</v>

822
00:46:42.521 --> 00:46:45.760
<v Speaker 1>domains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we'll talk later in the course about</v>

823
00:46:45.761 --> 00:46:46.594
<v Speaker 1>why that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to think it's because those people </v>

824
00:46:49.241 --> 00:46:53.470
<v Speaker 1>set up the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that they could thrive as well.</v>

825
00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:56.800
<v Speaker 1>There's an element of that obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because once you're rich,</v>

826
00:46:56.801 --> 00:47:01.630
<v Speaker 1>you're going to prefer political </v>
<v Speaker 1>policies that help you stay rich.</v>

827
00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:05.050
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean that you set up </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole damn system that made you rich</v>

828
00:47:05.051 --> 00:47:06.300
<v Speaker 1>to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plastics,</v>

829
00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:10.030
<v Speaker 1>not the same people over any reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>span of time.</v>

830
00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:13.060
<v Speaker 1>So the 1% of people who have most of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

831
00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:16.330
<v Speaker 1>it's always 1% but it's not the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

832
00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:17.193
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each in individuals tend to hold on to </v>

833
00:47:19.331 --> 00:47:23.590
<v Speaker 1>money for very short periods of time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>big companies don't last very long.</v>

834
00:47:23.591 --> 00:47:24.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

835
00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:28.210
<v Speaker 1>they last on average about 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>35 40 years and that's it.</v>

836
00:47:28.211 --> 00:47:30.220
<v Speaker 1>Then they disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when it's,</v>

837
00:47:30.221 --> 00:47:31.054
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the economic landscape is just churning </v>

838
00:47:33.251 --> 00:47:36.790
<v Speaker 1>like Mac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult for a company to,</v>

839
00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:37.983
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not that many big steam coach </v>

840
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:41.470
<v Speaker 1>companies anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

841
00:47:41.471 --> 00:47:41.951
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

842
00:47:41.951 --> 00:47:46.210
<v Speaker 1>and nobody makes zeppelins and nobody </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes typewriters.</v>

843
00:47:46.211 --> 00:47:48.190
<v Speaker 1>And you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's things move quick.</v>

844
00:47:48.191 --> 00:47:49.024
<v Speaker 1>And just because you dominated the </v>
<v Speaker 1>landscape at one particular moment </v>

845
00:47:51.161 --> 00:47:53.170
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean you're going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it that the nest.</v>

846
00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:55.750
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

847
00:47:55.751 --> 00:47:58.330
<v Speaker 1>so the create your own meaning thing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a rough one.</v>

848
00:47:58.690 --> 00:47:59.523
<v Speaker 1>And then there's another problem too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what makes you think you have </v>

849
00:48:02.201 --> 00:48:04.690
<v Speaker 1>enough time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

850
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:06.543
<v Speaker 1>lots of times people come to me and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have relationship problems and part of </v>

851
00:48:10.031 --> 00:48:10.864
<v Speaker 1>the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they've set their relationships </v>

852
00:48:12.641 --> 00:48:16.090
<v Speaker 1>up outside of social norms and they do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

853
00:48:16.091 --> 00:48:18.160
<v Speaker 1>And also they'll say something to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>

854
00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:19.293
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to get married because </v>

855
00:48:20.081 --> 00:48:23.950
<v Speaker 1>marriage is just a piece of paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really a stupid thing to say.</v>

856
00:48:23.951 --> 00:48:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Like it's an incredibly stupid thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

857
00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:26.973
<v Speaker 1>But underneath that there's this idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they want to remain free of social </v>

858
00:48:30.851 --> 00:48:33.400
<v Speaker 1>constraints so that they can negotiate </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own way.</v>

859
00:48:33.401 --> 00:48:35.170
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're giving them credit for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

860
00:48:35.171 --> 00:48:37.930
<v Speaker 1>wanting freedom instead of just escaping</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

861
00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:40.270
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with that is it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

862
00:48:40.810 --> 00:48:42.340
<v Speaker 1>good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try it.</v>

863
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:43.833
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would assume that you have enough </v>

864
00:48:45.911 --> 00:48:46.744
<v Speaker 1>time in the 30 or 40 years that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be pursuing relationships to </v>

865
00:48:50.531 --> 00:48:53.050
<v Speaker 1>actually figure out how they should run.</v>

866
00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.900
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a hope of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's worse too,</v>

867
00:48:55.901 --> 00:48:58.960
<v Speaker 1>because very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very few people can negotiate,</v>

868
00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:00.830
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the,</v>

869
00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:03.550
<v Speaker 1>here's the way it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New.</v>

870
00:49:03.551 --> 00:49:07.780
<v Speaker 1>Either adhere to the social order or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand outside of it.</v>

871
00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:09.333
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you stand outside of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in a chaotic place because </v>

872
00:49:11.591 --> 00:49:12.424
<v Speaker 1>there's no guidelines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you either live chaotically </v>

873
00:49:14.951 --> 00:49:19.600
<v Speaker 1>because there's no guidelines or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to formulate order.</v>

874
00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:21.123
<v Speaker 1>But to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to know what you want and you </v>

875
00:49:24.761 --> 00:49:25.594
<v Speaker 1>have to know how to express it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to figure out what </v>

876
00:49:29.021 --> 00:49:31.810
<v Speaker 1>your partner wants and help them express</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

877
00:49:31.811 --> 00:49:34.030
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to negotiate a </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution.</v>

878
00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:38.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say one in 20 people know how to</v>

879
00:49:38.471 --> 00:49:40.660
<v Speaker 1>negotiate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

880
00:49:40.661 --> 00:49:41.950
<v Speaker 1>really difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you mean,</v>

881
00:49:41.951 --> 00:49:43.510
<v Speaker 1>just think of the steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

882
00:49:43.511 --> 00:49:46.540
<v Speaker 1>you have to know what you want and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to admit it to yourself.</v>

883
00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:47.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

884
00:49:47.411 --> 00:49:48.490
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

885
00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:49.533
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not even going to get to the </v>

886
00:49:50.411 --> 00:49:52.930
<v Speaker 1>first one in all likelihood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want?</v>

887
00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:56.350
<v Speaker 1>A lot of what you want can't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulated even,</v>

888
00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:58.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an example.</v>

889
00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:03.280
<v Speaker 1>So there's a great study done a while </v>
<v Speaker 1>back on prediction of,</v>

890
00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:06.370
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a relationship longevity.</v>

891
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here was the question.</v>

892
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:11.703
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many negative interactions do you </v>

893
00:50:13.391 --> 00:50:16.960
<v Speaker 1>have to have per set of positive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry?</v>

894
00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:20.770
<v Speaker 1>How many positive interactions per </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative interaction do you have to have</v>

895
00:50:20.771 --> 00:50:24.430
<v Speaker 1>with your partner in order for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to remain stable?</v>

896
00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:26.403
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's say you have one negative </v>

897
00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:31.040
<v Speaker 1>interaction to every one positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction.</v>

898
00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:31.933
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe have 10 negatives to every </v>

899
00:50:33.081 --> 00:50:33.914
<v Speaker 1>positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you can imagine a different </v>

900
00:50:35.061 --> 00:50:37.700
<v Speaker 1>situation where you have a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive to one naked,</v>

901
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:40.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanning the whole potential continue.</v>

902
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:44.360
<v Speaker 1>And you use that to predict relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction and longevity.</v>

903
00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:45.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

904
00:50:45.741 --> 00:50:46.574
<v Speaker 1>well God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously a hundred positive to one </v>

905
00:50:48.861 --> 00:50:52.190
<v Speaker 1>negative is where is the preferable </v>
<v Speaker 1>ratio.</v>

906
00:50:52.191 --> 00:50:54.500
<v Speaker 1>And so it's those people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

907
00:50:54.501 --> 00:50:58.670
<v Speaker 1>their relationship is nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 1>constant compliments and bliss.</v>

908
00:50:58.671 --> 00:51:00.710
<v Speaker 1>They're the ones who last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not true.</v>

909
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:03.820
<v Speaker 1>What you see is that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

910
00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:07.910
<v Speaker 1>an optimal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an optimal ratio domain.</v>

911
00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:12.170
<v Speaker 1>If it falls below five to one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive to negative,</v>

912
00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:15.980
<v Speaker 1>then your relationship falls apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too negative.</v>

913
00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:17.233
<v Speaker 1>And it's partly because people feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion more than they feel </v>

914
00:51:19.671 --> 00:51:23.630
<v Speaker 1>positive emotion because you can be hurt</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than you can be pleased.</v>

915
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:28.550
<v Speaker 1>And so one that's only five to one is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>punishing and people won't,</v>

916
00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:31.790
<v Speaker 1>won't stay in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you get above 11 to one,</v>

917
00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:36.230
<v Speaker 1>it gets not punishing enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

918
00:51:36.231 --> 00:51:37.670
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean exactly?</v>

919
00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want in a relationship?</v>

920
00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:43.970
<v Speaker 1>While you think bliss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like that isn't what you want.</v>

921
00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:44.803
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more like he wants someone to </v>

922
00:51:46.011 --> 00:51:47.660
<v Speaker 1>contend with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

923
00:51:47.661 --> 00:51:48.494
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to push over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want everything just to be </v>

924
00:51:50.751 --> 00:51:51.471
<v Speaker 1>easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

925
00:51:51.471 --> 00:51:53.180
<v Speaker 1>And this is the sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

926
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:55.543
<v Speaker 1>the sort of phenomena that kierkegaard </v>
<v Speaker 1>was talking about when he talked about </v>

927
00:51:57.741 --> 00:51:58.574
<v Speaker 1>deciding to make things more difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>for people because that's what they </v>

928
00:52:00.711 --> 00:52:02.000
<v Speaker 1>need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

929
00:52:02.330 --> 00:52:06.080
<v Speaker 1>you know this perfectly well because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you go out with someone and they worship</v>

930
00:52:06.081 --> 00:52:06.914
<v Speaker 1>you and they don't on your every word </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's nothing but positive </v>

931
00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:10.483
<v Speaker 1>feedback coming from them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lose respect for them almost an </v>

932
00:52:12.531 --> 00:52:15.770
<v Speaker 1>instantly and you go wander off and find</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's more interesting.</v>

933
00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:17.203
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason for that I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you want the person that you're </v>

934
00:52:20.571 --> 00:52:21.404
<v Speaker 1>with to challenge you so that not only </v>
<v Speaker 1>do you do reasonably well data gate day </v>

935
00:52:26.601 --> 00:52:27.530
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

936
00:52:27.531 --> 00:52:32.120
<v Speaker 1>so that you can coexist in the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>space with a reasonable amount of pace.</v>

937
00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:33.193
<v Speaker 1>But you also want there to be enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>tension in the relationship so that </v>

938
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:39.080
<v Speaker 1>you're both involved in a process of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mutual transformation.</v>

939
00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:42.560
<v Speaker 1>Well try specifying that in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulated way.</v>

940
00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:44.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good luck,</v>

941
00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:45.613
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it also explains strange things </v>

942
00:52:47.421 --> 00:52:50.900
<v Speaker 1>about people like the fact that they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>stay in pretty negative relationships.</v>

943
00:52:50.901 --> 00:52:51.734
<v Speaker 1>Like what the hell are you doing there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had articulated it two years ago </v>

944
00:52:55.641 --> 00:52:56.151
<v Speaker 1>and you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

945
00:52:56.151 --> 00:52:59.450
<v Speaker 1>I want to be with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm miserable with half the time,</v>

946
00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:01.760
<v Speaker 1>of course you're never going to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

947
00:53:01.761 --> 00:53:04.040
<v Speaker 1>But it could easily be that that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're after.</v>

948
00:53:04.850 --> 00:53:07.760
<v Speaker 1>So well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

949
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:13.270
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now heidegger is another philosopher who</v>

950
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:14.833
<v Speaker 1>was attempting in some sense to solve </v>
<v Speaker 1>the problems that were laid out by </v>

951
00:53:18.651 --> 00:53:19.484
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche and Dostoevsky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way that heidegger heidegger </v>

952
00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:28.300
<v Speaker 1>began to resolve them was by taking a </v>
<v Speaker 1>radically new lockout philosophy itself.</v>

953
00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:31.680
<v Speaker 1>And</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

954
00:53:31.681 --> 00:53:32.514
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was one of the prime </v>

955
00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:34.943
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I told you a while back that the </v>

956
00:53:37.021 --> 00:53:42.021
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists decided to re </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitute Western philosophy.</v>

957
00:53:42.481 --> 00:53:45.630
<v Speaker 1>So that was focusing on being instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>

958
00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:46.913
<v Speaker 1>And so the hardest thing to grasp about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenologists is what exactly </v>

959
00:53:50.461 --> 00:53:54.180
<v Speaker 1>they meant by being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'll give you a,</v>

960
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:55.223
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you a overview of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's where the term dad sign comes </v>

961
00:53:58.531 --> 00:53:59.364
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a German term and it means </v>

962
00:54:00.241 --> 00:54:01.074
<v Speaker 1>being there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so right now you're encapsulated in </v>

963
00:54:03.421 --> 00:54:07.740
<v Speaker 1>a dad side and the design is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>totality of your experience.</v>

964
00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:12.870
<v Speaker 1>And that experience would be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of the extended world,</v>

965
00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:18.120
<v Speaker 1>the natural world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the social world.</v>

966
00:54:18.810 --> 00:54:22.650
<v Speaker 1>And then inside that the world of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective experience.</v>

967
00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:27.810
<v Speaker 1>And that constitutes be it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the phenomenologists make the case.</v>

968
00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:31.590
<v Speaker 1>They're not playing this subject object </v>
<v Speaker 1>gate and they're standing outside of the</v>

969
00:54:31.591 --> 00:54:33.210
<v Speaker 1>division between subject and object.</v>

970
00:54:33.210 --> 00:54:35.040
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the scientific world </v>
<v Speaker 1>view.</v>

971
00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:40.640
<v Speaker 1>So it's a real paradigm shift in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't use the rules from the old way</v>

972
00:54:40.921 --> 00:54:44.010
<v Speaker 1>of looking at things inside the new way </v>
<v Speaker 1>of looking at things.</v>

973
00:54:44.011 --> 00:54:46.490
<v Speaker 1>You have to start with new </v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions.</v>

974
00:54:46.491 --> 00:54:50.220
<v Speaker 1>So we might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well one of the things that you're going</v>

975
00:54:50.221 --> 00:54:51.054
<v Speaker 1>to do if you look at things </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologically is to assume that </v>

976
00:54:53.101 --> 00:54:57.000
<v Speaker 1>everything that you experience is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

977
00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:58.433
<v Speaker 1>so then we would say that there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt in that phenomenological world </v>

978
00:55:02.731 --> 00:55:03.564
<v Speaker 1>to reduce pain to something material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pain stands as stands itself as a </v>

979
00:55:08.761 --> 00:55:10.680
<v Speaker 1>phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So does anxiety.</v>

980
00:55:10.681 --> 00:55:14.460
<v Speaker 1>So does joy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the things that that scientists have</v>

981
00:55:14.461 --> 00:55:19.461
<v Speaker 1>consciousness call quallies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are viewed by them as qualities of</v>

982
00:55:19.801 --> 00:55:23.010
<v Speaker 1>the objective world aren't viewed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way by the phenomenologists.</v>

983
00:55:23.011 --> 00:55:26.250
<v Speaker 1>They just say those are primary elements</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being.</v>

984
00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:28.043
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very interesting way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at things because it kind of </v>

985
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:33.960
<v Speaker 1>allows you to reclaim the validity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own experience.</v>

986
00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:35.490
<v Speaker 1>You can no longer say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

987
00:55:35.491 --> 00:55:36.324
<v Speaker 1>that's only subjective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that doesn't mean that everything </v>

988
00:55:39.781 --> 00:55:44.781
<v Speaker 1>you play him subjectively is true </v>
<v Speaker 1>objectively or for other people.</v>

989
00:55:45.930 --> 00:55:46.763
<v Speaker 1>What it does mean is that everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you experience subjectively is </v>

990
00:55:50.371 --> 00:55:51.204
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't mean you have to not </v>

991
00:55:53.551 --> 00:55:56.190
<v Speaker 1>think about it or take it apart or </v>
<v Speaker 1>categorize it properly.</v>

992
00:55:56.191 --> 00:55:57.870
<v Speaker 1>You still have to do all of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

993
00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:03.440
<v Speaker 1>but you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're put into a place where there's no</v>

994
00:56:03.841 --> 00:56:04.674
<v Speaker 1>need to deny the reality of your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience or to subordinate it to </v>

995
00:56:07.621 --> 00:56:11.220
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

996
00:56:11.610 --> 00:56:13.740
<v Speaker 1>if I'm doing dream analysis with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

997
00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:16.530
<v Speaker 1>which I do often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people dream,</v>

998
00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:19.750
<v Speaker 1>because dreams as young pointed out are </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

999
00:56:20.070 --> 00:56:21.180
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1000
00:56:21.330 --> 00:56:24.640
<v Speaker 1>they're manifestations of being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't come up with them,</v>

1001
00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:25.743
<v Speaker 1>they appear to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sort of appear out of nowhere in </v>

1002
00:56:28.151 --> 00:56:30.550
<v Speaker 1>some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They manifest themselves,</v>

1003
00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:33.110
<v Speaker 1>they do it strangely.</v>

1004
00:56:33.310 --> 00:56:37.600
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason for that is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they contain unarticulated thought.</v>

1005
00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:42.130
<v Speaker 1>But if you can get a handle on them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>assess them,</v>

1006
00:56:42.131 --> 00:56:45.130
<v Speaker 1>then sometimes they can tell you things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's no other way you can figure</v>

1007
00:56:45.131 --> 00:56:45.964
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's really cool about them is </v>

1008
00:56:47.021 --> 00:56:47.854
<v Speaker 1>that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have the same impersonality as </v>

1009
00:56:52.571 --> 00:56:53.404
<v Speaker 1>phenomena in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the broader world of experience </v>

1010
00:56:58.061 --> 00:56:58.631
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1011
00:56:58.631 --> 00:57:01.420
<v Speaker 1>you don't ever think about the truth of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a chair.</v>

1012
00:57:01.450 --> 00:57:04.480
<v Speaker 1>It's just there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And dreams are like that.</v>

1013
00:57:04.481 --> 00:57:05.314
<v Speaker 1>They're just there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you can untangle what they have </v>

1014
00:57:07.601 --> 00:57:09.610
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they indicate,</v>

1015
00:57:09.611 --> 00:57:14.500
<v Speaker 1>then you can get a take on your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience that's not</v>

1016
00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:23.120
<v Speaker 1>altered by any of your local subjective </v>
<v Speaker 1>wishes and desires.</v>

1017
00:57:23.121 --> 00:57:26.870
<v Speaker 1>I hate to use the word subjective in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of context.</v>

1018
00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:31.490
<v Speaker 1>So phenomenology is the study of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

1019
00:57:31.550 --> 00:57:35.120
<v Speaker 1>now and in being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a variety of aspects.</v>

1020
00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:38.300
<v Speaker 1>So one aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never remember the names of these,</v>

1021
00:57:38.301 --> 00:57:41.210
<v Speaker 1>but I'll get it here right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

1022
00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:43.113
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heidegger broke the world of experience </v>

1023
00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:48.860
<v Speaker 1>being into three basic categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was the unwelcomed,</v>

1024
00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:53.360
<v Speaker 1>which I think is basically the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond culture and the individual.</v>

1025
00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:58.790
<v Speaker 1>There's the mid dwelt and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world that we share with everyone else.</v>

1026
00:57:58.791 --> 00:58:01.460
<v Speaker 1>So that's roughly the social world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the social structures.</v>

1027
00:58:01.461 --> 00:58:02.294
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the eigen value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that domain of experience </v>

1028
00:58:05.061 --> 00:58:08.000
<v Speaker 1>that's unique to you that other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't partake in.</v>

1029
00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:09.343
<v Speaker 1>So those are the elements of being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as the phenomenologists were </v>

1030
00:58:13.310 --> 00:58:14.143
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in those domains of being different </v>

1031
00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:20.083
<v Speaker 1>experiences manifest themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about some of the ones that </v>

1032
00:58:22.791 --> 00:58:25.250
<v Speaker 1>would be manifestations of the,</v>

1033
00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:28.133
<v Speaker 2>I can belt</v>

1034
00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:33.230
<v Speaker 1>scientists would call those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional or motivational states.</v>

1035
00:58:33.590 --> 00:58:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Normally people think of them as </v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings.</v>

1036
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:38.540
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel that's,</v>

1037
00:58:38.570 --> 00:58:39.403
<v Speaker 1>I feel such and such.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are experiences that that </v>

1038
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:45.620
<v Speaker 1>manifest themselves to you or that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

1039
00:58:45.621 --> 00:58:46.454
<v Speaker 1>depending on how you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are indicative of the manner in </v>

1040
00:58:51.381 --> 00:58:53.900
<v Speaker 1>which you should act in relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

1041
00:58:54.830 --> 00:58:56.900
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of,</v>

1042
00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:01.340
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason that this is relevant</v>
<v Speaker 1>to psychotherapy in particular,</v>

1043
00:59:01.341 --> 00:59:03.080
<v Speaker 1>it was because of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1044
00:59:03.081 --> 00:59:03.914
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenologists were very </v>

1045
00:59:05.481 --> 00:59:07.910
<v Speaker 1>interested in the manifestation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>

1046
00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:10.490
<v Speaker 1>So you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1047
00:59:11.330 --> 00:59:12.163
<v Speaker 1>nihilism is the absence of meaning and </v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarianism is the fixed headedness </v>

1048
00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:17.270
<v Speaker 1>of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1049
00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:19.850
<v Speaker 1>If you're a totalitarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is say,</v>

1050
00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:23.510
<v Speaker 1>all exist in relationship to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

1051
00:59:23.511 --> 00:59:26.870
<v Speaker 1>It's almost as if from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists would say you're trying</v>

1052
00:59:26.871 --> 00:59:29.540
<v Speaker 1>to reduce the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weld,</v>

1053
00:59:29.570 --> 00:59:33.150
<v Speaker 1>which is the natural world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mip Weld,</v>

1054
00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:35.570
<v Speaker 1>which is the social world and the Eigen </v>
<v Speaker 1>belt,</v>

1055
00:59:35.571 --> 00:59:36.440
<v Speaker 1>which is your own world.</v>

1056
00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:37.273
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to reduce all of that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Midwest so that everything falls </v>

1057
00:59:41.121 --> 00:59:45.140
<v Speaker 1>under an explanation that's granted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you by some higher authority.</v>

1058
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.160
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then of course the nihilists art are</v>

1059
00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:50.780
<v Speaker 1>having none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They see,</v>

1060
00:59:50.810 --> 00:59:51.800
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1061
00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:52.813
<v Speaker 1>they use their eigen felt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say their own world to </v>

1062
00:59:57.351 --> 01:00:02.351
<v Speaker 1>invalidate meaning in any domain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the phenomenologists would say,</v>

1063
01:00:02.511 --> 01:00:03.344
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a mistake to use your rationality </v>

1064
01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:07.750
<v Speaker 1>to undermine the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1065
01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:10.250
<v Speaker 1>the sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the manifestation of meaning.</v>

1066
01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:11.323
<v Speaker 1>And I can give you an example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you're a good nihilist and </v>

1067
01:00:15.621 --> 01:00:18.530
<v Speaker 1>you think that maybe you're going to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>do something difficult,</v>

1068
01:00:18.531 --> 01:00:19.364
<v Speaker 1>like put yourself through university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you think in a relatively </v>

1069
01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:23.923
<v Speaker 1>depressed state of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you encounter some obstacles of </v>

1070
01:00:26.391 --> 01:00:28.400
<v Speaker 1>one form or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>

1071
01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:29.630
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hell with this.</v>

1072
01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:31.990
<v Speaker 1>Who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what difference does it make anyways?</v>

1073
01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:34.700
<v Speaker 1>Who cares if I go and get my degree?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1074
01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:35.683
<v Speaker 1>none of this knowledge is particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant or meaningful and who the hell </v>

1075
01:00:37.911 --> 01:00:40.040
<v Speaker 1>is going to know the difference in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>million years?</v>

1076
01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:41.840
<v Speaker 1>And so you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1077
01:00:41.841 --> 01:00:44.490
<v Speaker 1>that's a perfectly rational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1078
01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:48.230
<v Speaker 1>dismissal because who is going to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a million years?</v>

1079
01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Or let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1080
01:00:49.431 --> 01:00:50.264
<v Speaker 1>even if you could make a case that </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone might know there might be some </v>

1081
01:00:52.821 --> 01:00:53.654
<v Speaker 1>effects left of you in a million years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we'll just multiply it by 100,000 </v>

1082
01:00:57.861 --> 01:01:00.110
<v Speaker 1>and go to a trillion years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here you are,</v>

1083
01:01:00.111 --> 01:01:02.080
<v Speaker 1>you're this little tiny speck on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>slight,</v>

1084
01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:02.923
<v Speaker 1>you'd made your speck in the middle of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>galaxy that has god only knows how many </v>

1085
01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.473
<v Speaker 1>billion stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a billion of those </v>

1086
01:01:09.651 --> 01:01:10.484
<v Speaker 1>galaxies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although there's way more than that and </v>

1087
01:01:12.291 --> 01:01:15.110
<v Speaker 1>they're spread across this tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 1>expansive time.</v>

1088
01:01:15.350 --> 01:01:18.530
<v Speaker 1>And in the face of all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who cares what you do?</v>

1089
01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:22.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a phenomenologist would say is,</v>

1090
01:01:22.041 --> 01:01:22.874
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's look at how meaning manifests </v>

1091
01:01:28.271 --> 01:01:32.260
<v Speaker 1>itself when you alter your own</v>

1092
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:35.223
<v Speaker 1>private world in a variety of manners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you're trying to do </v>

1093
01:01:41.021 --> 01:01:42.460
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're working in a,</v>

1094
01:01:42.490 --> 01:01:46.720
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're working as a volunteer in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hospital helping sick kids,</v>

1095
01:01:46.721 --> 01:01:47.554
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're reading to them so that they're </v>

1096
01:01:48.551 --> 01:01:51.550
<v Speaker 1>distracted from their pain and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1097
01:01:51.551 --> 01:01:53.770
<v Speaker 1>in the trillion years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's going to know the difference?</v>

1098
01:01:53.771 --> 01:01:54.910
<v Speaker 1>And so they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1099
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.240
<v Speaker 1>it's meaningless to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the phenomenologists would say,</v>

1100
01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:01.270
<v Speaker 1>if the frame of reference that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>using,</v>

1101
01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:03.580
<v Speaker 1>like if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're imposing,</v>

1102
01:02:05.170 --> 01:02:06.003
<v Speaker 1>if you're transforming the way you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>being manifested itself so that it </v>

1103
01:02:09.431 --> 01:02:14.431
<v Speaker 1>becomes meaningless and absurd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you should try experiencing it in a</v>

1104
01:02:15.911 --> 01:02:16.744
<v Speaker 1>different manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's d c because a rationalist in </v>

1105
01:02:20.941 --> 01:02:21.774
<v Speaker 1>some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenologists say a rationalist </v>

1106
01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:27.240
<v Speaker 1>can't deal with the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What difference is it going to make an a</v>

1107
01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:28.260
<v Speaker 1>trillion years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here you are,</v>

1108
01:02:28.261 --> 01:02:30.480
<v Speaker 1>a little dust speck among all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>other dust specs.</v>

1109
01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:33.870
<v Speaker 1>It's ultimately meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A phenomenologist would say</v>

1110
01:02:36.550 --> 01:02:39.820
<v Speaker 1>maximize the meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

1111
01:02:39.850 --> 01:02:43.030
<v Speaker 1>that's the marker of truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's so,</v>

1112
01:02:43.090 --> 01:02:44.980
<v Speaker 1>it's a completely different way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it.</v>

1113
01:02:44.981 --> 01:02:45.880
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would say,</v>

1114
01:02:45.881 --> 01:02:46.714
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you're going to a hospital and </v>

1115
01:02:49.091 --> 01:02:49.924
<v Speaker 1>you're reading to sick children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the frame of reference that you </v>

1116
01:02:53.201 --> 01:02:54.034
<v Speaker 1>should use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that you allow that experience </v>

1117
01:02:56.501 --> 01:02:57.334
<v Speaker 1>to manifest itself should be such that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the experience manifests itself so that </v>

1118
01:03:02.471 --> 01:03:06.550
<v Speaker 1>it's as meaningful as possible rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than is meaning less.</v>

1119
01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:09.010
<v Speaker 1>The idea being that just because you can</v>

1120
01:03:12.370 --> 01:03:13.203
<v Speaker 1>twist your own experience so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain elements of your being become </v>

1121
01:03:19.211 --> 01:03:22.270
<v Speaker 1>meaningless does not mean that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1122
01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:23.763
<v Speaker 1>The fact that it becomes meaningless </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually means that it's wrong because </v>

1123
01:03:27.611 --> 01:03:28.444
<v Speaker 1>you think you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all depends on what you allow to be </v>

1124
01:03:32.651 --> 01:03:35.140
<v Speaker 1>primary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the phenomenologists point.</v>

1125
01:03:35.410 --> 01:03:38.620
<v Speaker 1>If you allow your strict rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be primary.</v>

1126
01:03:38.621 --> 01:03:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Then if it can attack something and </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy it,</v>

1127
01:03:41.681 --> 01:03:45.100
<v Speaker 1>then that thing is worthy of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacked and destroyed it.</v>

1128
01:03:45.490 --> 01:03:47.380
<v Speaker 1>But if you flip it around and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1129
01:03:47.381 --> 01:03:48.214
<v Speaker 1>what you should be doing is allowing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is interacting with your experience or </v>

1130
01:03:53.261 --> 01:03:54.094
<v Speaker 1>allowing your experience to manifest </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself in a manner that situates you </v>

1131
01:03:58.510 --> 01:03:59.343
<v Speaker 1>most meaningfully in the here and now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever framework you're using to do </v>

1132
01:04:04.721 --> 01:04:06.550
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that works is right.</v>

1133
01:04:07.590 --> 01:04:09.490
<v Speaker 1>What's a completely different way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at things?</v>

1134
01:04:09.491 --> 01:04:12.550
<v Speaker 1>And it's a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real escape from the pathology of</v>

1135
01:04:12.551 --> 01:04:14.560
<v Speaker 1>rationalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1136
01:04:14.561 --> 01:04:19.561
<v Speaker 1>because it isn't obvious that what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think should take priority.</v>

1137
01:04:21.070 --> 01:04:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Now the phenomenologists would go </v>
<v Speaker 1>farther than that.</v>

1138
01:04:23.471 --> 01:04:25.990
<v Speaker 1>They would say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something.</v>

1139
01:04:27.790 --> 01:04:29.560
<v Speaker 1>So here's a way of thinking about it.</v>

1140
01:04:37.090 --> 01:04:41.590
<v Speaker 1>So been swinging your seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we perceive our first and foremost,</v>

1141
01:04:41.591 --> 01:04:44.380
<v Speaker 1>Vince Wanger was a psychiatrist who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>very much influenced.</v>

1142
01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:45.633
<v Speaker 1>It's why your advice where the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk about mostly were </v>

1143
01:04:47.381 --> 01:04:49.540
<v Speaker 1>very much influenced by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gary and ideas,</v>

1144
01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:50.853
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we perceive our first and </v>

1145
01:04:52.841 --> 01:04:55.030
<v Speaker 1>foremost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not impressions of tastes,</v>

1146
01:04:55.031 --> 01:04:55.870
<v Speaker 1>tone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smell,</v>

1147
01:04:55.871 --> 01:04:58.390
<v Speaker 1>or touch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even things or objects,</v>

1148
01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:01.330
<v Speaker 1>but meanings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1149
01:05:01.331 --> 01:05:02.164
<v Speaker 1>so the idea for the phenomenologists is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that what being is made out of this </v>

1150
01:05:05.441 --> 01:05:09.460
<v Speaker 1>meaning it isn't that the objective </v>
<v Speaker 1>world is made out of things.</v>

1151
01:05:09.461 --> 01:05:11.620
<v Speaker 1>It's the being is made out of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1152
01:05:11.621 --> 01:05:12.454
<v Speaker 1>some of those meetings can be positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of them can be negative and </v>

1153
01:05:14.951 --> 01:05:15.784
<v Speaker 1>some of them can be neutral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the constituent elements of being </v>

1154
01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:21.910
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental constituent element of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being as mean.</v>

1155
01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:25.490
<v Speaker 1>And then there was an argument between </v>
<v Speaker 1>bins,</v>

1156
01:05:25.491 --> 01:05:28.450
<v Speaker 1>swagger and boss about how that meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest itself.</v>

1157
01:05:28.450 --> 01:05:32.650
<v Speaker 1>So been swagger would say that you endow</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning on the world.</v>

1158
01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:33.573
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of a nichey and idea that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you create your own values so that you </v>

1159
01:05:36.821 --> 01:05:41.821
<v Speaker 1>have within you something he called an a</v>
<v Speaker 1>priori ontological structure.</v>

1160
01:05:42.070 --> 01:05:42.903
<v Speaker 1>It's a world designed or a matrix of </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that determines how the world </v>

1161
01:05:46.061 --> 01:05:46.894
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the easiest way to think about that </v>

1162
01:05:48.911 --> 01:05:53.620
<v Speaker 1>is that you know you're thrown into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular time and place.</v>

1163
01:05:53.621 --> 01:05:57.400
<v Speaker 1>That's another existentialist idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the absurdity of your</v>

1164
01:05:57.401 --> 01:05:58.234
<v Speaker 1>life is that you're here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in this particular context and </v>

1165
01:06:01.511 --> 01:06:03.880
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something you have to contend with.</v>

1166
01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:05.043
<v Speaker 1>And that's true for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There arbitrary preconditions to </v>

1167
01:06:07.031 --> 01:06:10.150
<v Speaker 1>everyone's Ba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of those arbitrary preconditions</v>

1168
01:06:10.151 --> 01:06:12.970
<v Speaker 1>is the structure through which you look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the world.</v>

1169
01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:14.463
<v Speaker 1>And that structure enables some things </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be highlighted in some things to be </v>

1170
01:06:17.651 --> 01:06:18.484
<v Speaker 1>ignored.</v>

1171
01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:23.110
<v Speaker 1>And so the way that meaning manifests </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself is a reflection of this,</v>

1172
01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:24.153
<v Speaker 1>a priori ontological structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the primary mode of being so there </v>

1173
01:06:28.361 --> 01:06:29.194
<v Speaker 1>can't be being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is say your experience for the </v>

1174
01:06:32.441 --> 01:06:33.274
<v Speaker 1>sake of our argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without the structure that consists of </v>

1175
01:06:36.641 --> 01:06:38.410
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that you consist of.</v>

1176
01:06:39.070 --> 01:06:39.903
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a given and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the action of that structure that </v>

1177
01:06:43.331 --> 01:06:48.331
<v Speaker 1>determines the meaning of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now boss would say exactly the opposite.</v>

1178
01:06:48.731 --> 01:06:51.760
<v Speaker 1>He would say that's the wrong way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at it.</v>

1179
01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:55.360
<v Speaker 1>You should look at the totality of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence,</v>

1180
01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:59.890
<v Speaker 1>which is partly the broad natural world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cultural world,</v>

1181
01:06:59.891 --> 01:07:00.724
<v Speaker 1>and your own world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you should note that meaning arises </v>

1182
01:07:03.191 --> 01:07:06.700
<v Speaker 1>in different places of its own accord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

1183
01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:11.320
<v Speaker 1>you can't reduce it to the action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say of this ontological,</v>

1184
01:07:11.321 --> 01:07:16.000
<v Speaker 1>a priori ontological structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one example would be,</v>

1185
01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:17.673
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about the meaning of things you </v>

1186
01:07:18.431 --> 01:07:19.630
<v Speaker 1>don't understand?</v>

1187
01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:21.573
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to understand how the meaning </v>

1188
01:07:22.901 --> 01:07:26.800
<v Speaker 1>of things you don't understand can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>attributed to what you understand.</v>

1189
01:07:27.070 --> 01:07:29.530
<v Speaker 1>The meaning seems to be there to begin </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

1190
01:07:29.531 --> 01:07:31.770
<v Speaker 1>So here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

1191
01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:34.570
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a relationship with someone and</v>

1192
01:07:34.571 --> 01:07:37.330
<v Speaker 1>you discover that they have an affair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1193
01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:41.080
<v Speaker 1>the discovery of the affair is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be something that's meaningful.</v>

1194
01:07:41.350 --> 01:07:42.183
<v Speaker 1>Now you don't know what the meaning is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to interpret it to begin </v>

1195
01:07:44.321 --> 01:07:45.880
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>likely very negatively,</v>

1196
01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:47.613
<v Speaker 1>except to the degree that part of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would like to escape out of the </v>

1197
01:07:49.721 --> 01:07:51.640
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1198
01:07:51.641 --> 01:07:52.474
<v Speaker 1>Because sometimes if you're a betrayed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're happy about it because it's time </v>

1199
01:07:54.821 --> 01:07:57.220
<v Speaker 1>for that to be overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in any case,</v>

1200
01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:00.790
<v Speaker 1>there are things that you can encounter </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't understand,</v>

1201
01:08:00.791 --> 01:08:02.860
<v Speaker 1>that are meaningful in and of </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

1202
01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:04.353
<v Speaker 1>So I think that you actually can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate your structure from the </v>

1203
01:08:10.061 --> 01:08:11.440
<v Speaker 1>structure of everything.</v>

1204
01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:16.180
<v Speaker 1>They're always interacting and meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerges out of the interplay of those.</v>

1205
01:08:16.181 --> 01:08:18.200
<v Speaker 1>So here's another way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1206
01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:22.250
<v Speaker 1>You're reading a book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The book is meaningful.</v>

1207
01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:26.600
<v Speaker 1>Where's the meaning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it in your head?</v>

1208
01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:30.800
<v Speaker 1>Is it in the book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While it's very difficult to say,</v>

1209
01:08:30.801 --> 01:08:31.634
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because obviously there's a subjective </v>

1210
01:08:33.711 --> 01:08:36.080
<v Speaker 1>element to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an element that's unique to you,</v>

1211
01:08:36.290 --> 01:08:37.123
<v Speaker 1>but just as obviously that meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't manifest itself if it wasn't </v>

1212
01:08:42.021 --> 01:08:42.854
<v Speaker 1>for the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course the book wouldn't be </v>

1213
01:08:44.181 --> 01:08:47.960
<v Speaker 1>meaningful if you end the book weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>embedded in this complex structure.</v>

1214
01:08:47.961 --> 01:08:50.840
<v Speaker 1>And so the meaning is an emergent </v>
<v Speaker 1>property.</v>

1215
01:08:51.230 --> 01:08:52.063
<v Speaker 1>The meaning is an emergent property of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the interplay of all of the elements of </v>

1216
01:08:56.061 --> 01:08:56.894
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very interesting way of looking </v>

1217
01:08:59.421 --> 01:09:02.450
<v Speaker 1>at things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have all these elements of PA and</v>

1218
01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:05.420
<v Speaker 1>their dance produces meaning of one form</v>
<v Speaker 1>or another.</v>

1219
01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:06.553
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say if you are a </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologist that some of that </v>

1220
01:09:08.781 --> 01:09:09.614
<v Speaker 1>meaning is going to be life sustaining </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of it is going to be life </v>

1221
01:09:12.771 --> 01:09:13.790
<v Speaker 1>destroying.</v>

1222
01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:19.070
<v Speaker 1>And the phenomenologists would say from </v>
<v Speaker 1>a clinical perspective that you're,</v>

1223
01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:20.690
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are,</v>

1224
01:09:20.750 --> 01:09:25.700
<v Speaker 1>if you exist in a system of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>revelations that are life destroying,</v>

1225
01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:29.990
<v Speaker 1>that you should turn your attention away</v>
<v Speaker 1>from them towards meetings that are life</v>

1226
01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:32.770
<v Speaker 1>affirming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1227
01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:33.613
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about the phenomenological </v>

1228
01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:38.690
<v Speaker 1>perspective is that you can experiment </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it quite easily.</v>

1229
01:09:38.691 --> 01:09:40.580
<v Speaker 1>So I could say to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1230
01:09:41.290 --> 01:09:43.790
<v Speaker 1>a couple of phenomenological </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiments,</v>

1231
01:09:43.791 --> 01:09:44.624
<v Speaker 1>one would be for the next two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to detach yourself in some </v>

1232
01:09:49.401 --> 01:09:54.110
<v Speaker 1>sense so that you're a curious observer </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your being.</v>

1233
01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:56.990
<v Speaker 1>You're not necessarily trying to direct </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1234
01:09:57.470 --> 01:09:59.540
<v Speaker 1>you know you're just trying to let it </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfold.</v>

1235
01:09:59.930 --> 01:10:00.763
<v Speaker 1>And then what you might want to watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>for is when the meaning that manifests </v>

1236
01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:10.160
<v Speaker 1>itself as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as things flow around you is clearly</v>

1237
01:10:11.810 --> 01:10:14.960
<v Speaker 1>meaning of the life affirming tight.</v>

1238
01:10:15.650 --> 01:10:16.483
<v Speaker 1>Now you'll see that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how well situated you are </v>

1239
01:10:19.041 --> 01:10:23.360
<v Speaker 1>in some sense because if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're surrounded by,</v>

1240
01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:27.920
<v Speaker 1>if your experiential field is primarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative,</v>

1241
01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:30.200
<v Speaker 1>these are going to be relatively rare </v>
<v Speaker 1>events,</v>

1242
01:10:30.201 --> 01:10:34.220
<v Speaker 1>but they will still not be nonexistent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might only happen for a few seconds</v>

1243
01:10:34.221 --> 01:10:36.410
<v Speaker 1>or a few minutes every day or every two </v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

1244
01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:37.760
<v Speaker 1>But so say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1245
01:10:37.761 --> 01:10:38.594
<v Speaker 1>you notice that all of a sudden you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a place where things are the way you </v>

1246
01:10:41.541 --> 01:10:44.300
<v Speaker 1>would like them to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could say you're in a place where</v>

1247
01:10:44.301 --> 01:10:47.660
<v Speaker 1>being is manifesting itself as </v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptable.</v>

1248
01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:49.363
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's a place where nihilism is not </v>

1249
01:10:51.051 --> 01:10:51.884
<v Speaker 1>appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't apply because of the quality </v>

1250
01:10:53.721 --> 01:10:56.780
<v Speaker 1>of the experience is such that it's life</v>
<v Speaker 1>affirming.</v>

1251
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.943
<v Speaker 1>You have to notice that it's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens and then you might ask </v>

1252
01:11:00.951 --> 01:11:02.450
<v Speaker 1>yourself law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1253
01:11:02.810 --> 01:11:05.630
<v Speaker 1>what are the preconditions that enabled </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1254
01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:08.173
<v Speaker 1>What are the preconditions that enabled </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the different sub elements of </v>

1255
01:11:10.971 --> 01:11:11.804
<v Speaker 1>being to work harmoniously together at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that time in place so that that was the </v>

1256
01:11:16.561 --> 01:11:17.394
<v Speaker 1>meaning that emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next question might be how </v>

1257
01:11:20.821 --> 01:11:25.500
<v Speaker 1>would it be possible for me to allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>that to happen more frequently?</v>

1258
01:11:26.370 --> 01:11:30.810
<v Speaker 1>And so you can tilt yourself towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>life affirming meetings in a way from,</v>

1259
01:11:31.710 --> 01:11:35.550
<v Speaker 1>from say meanings that are associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with despair of nihilism.</v>

1260
01:11:35.551 --> 01:11:36.384
<v Speaker 1>But you do that partly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like you're navigating in a </v>

1261
01:11:38.191 --> 01:11:39.690
<v Speaker 1>boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1262
01:11:39.691 --> 01:11:40.524
<v Speaker 1>I think you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're navigating to find the </v>

1263
01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:46.080
<v Speaker 1>line between order and chaos because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where the meaning is.</v>

1264
01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:46.943
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly where the meaning is and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can feel it like it's a place and </v>

1265
01:11:49.921 --> 01:11:50.754
<v Speaker 1>that's the other thing that phenomenal </v>
<v Speaker 1>just to trying to get across these </v>

1266
01:11:53.551 --> 01:11:54.384
<v Speaker 1>things are real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not secondary manifestations of </v>

1267
01:11:57.841 --> 01:11:59.100
<v Speaker 1>some deeper reality.</v>

1268
01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:02.010
<v Speaker 1>They are reality itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think,</v>

1269
01:12:02.011 --> 01:12:05.400
<v Speaker 1>and we'll talk about this more when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to the neuropsychological portion of</v>

1270
01:12:05.401 --> 01:12:08.790
<v Speaker 1>the course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your brain is actually set up first</v>

1271
01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:09.624
<v Speaker 1>and foremost to detect meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You detect meaning before you detect </v>

1272
01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:14.753
<v Speaker 1>objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's partly because you have to </v>

1273
01:12:17.791 --> 01:12:21.900
<v Speaker 1>detect meaning so that you know what to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do when something happens very rapidly.</v>

1274
01:12:21.901 --> 01:12:22.734
<v Speaker 1>And there are times when you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what to do before you have </v>

1275
01:12:25.261 --> 01:12:28.800
<v Speaker 1>enough time to even see what's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just don't have the time.</v>

1276
01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:31.110
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the question is,</v>

1277
01:12:31.111 --> 01:12:33.510
<v Speaker 1>well what exactly do you mean by </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning?</v>

1278
01:12:33.810 --> 01:12:34.643
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think meaning is significance for </v>

1279
01:12:35.971 --> 01:12:40.020
<v Speaker 1>behavior or significance for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure that governs behavior.</v>

1280
01:12:40.290 --> 01:12:41.123
<v Speaker 1>But those are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very basic fundamental perceptions </v>

1281
01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:45.000
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not.</v>

1282
01:12:45.001 --> 01:12:47.520
<v Speaker 1>You see the object and then you derive </v>
<v Speaker 1>the meaning.</v>

1283
01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:49.110
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the opposite.</v>

1284
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:54.110
<v Speaker 1>In many cases you perceive the meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>and derive the object and there's plenty</v>

1285
01:12:54.121 --> 01:12:57.060
<v Speaker 1>of neurophysiological evidence for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

1286
01:12:57.070 --> 01:12:59.100
<v Speaker 1>you have lots of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1287
01:12:59.101 --> 01:12:59.934
<v Speaker 1>your retina is a pattern detector and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the retinal information is transmitted </v>

1288
01:13:04.741 --> 01:13:06.330
<v Speaker 1>to your brain alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the optic nerve,</v>

1289
01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:10.320
<v Speaker 1>the optic nerve branches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it goes lots of places in your body.</v>

1290
01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:11.333
<v Speaker 1>Some of it maps right onto your spinal </v>
<v Speaker 1>cord so that your eyes can make your </v>

1291
01:13:14.341 --> 01:13:15.174
<v Speaker 1>body move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of it maps onto your Amygdala so </v>

1292
01:13:17.731 --> 01:13:18.564
<v Speaker 1>that what you perceive are the meanings </v>
<v Speaker 1>of facial expressions without even </v>

1293
01:13:21.271 --> 01:13:22.104
<v Speaker 1>perceiving the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can have people who have </v>

1294
01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:27.960
<v Speaker 1>blindsight a damaged visual Cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can show them angry faces,</v>

1295
01:13:27.961 --> 01:13:28.794
<v Speaker 1>which they say they can't see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they'll respond to them electro </v>

1296
01:13:31.801 --> 01:13:32.634
<v Speaker 1>physiologically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it as if they're being exposed to </v>

1297
01:13:34.741 --> 01:13:35.574
<v Speaker 1>something negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's because of the retinal pattern </v>

1298
01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:41.010
<v Speaker 1>is manifesting itself right onto the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

1299
01:13:41.010 --> 01:13:45.150
<v Speaker 1>That maps one form of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can clearly have meaning without,</v>

1300
01:13:45.570 --> 01:13:46.403
<v Speaker 1>without object perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that you derive the </v>

1301
01:13:48.841 --> 01:13:52.230
<v Speaker 1>meaning from the object,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the thing and then you attribute</v>

1302
01:13:52.231 --> 01:13:54.990
<v Speaker 1>meaning to the thing that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

1303
01:13:54.991 --> 01:13:55.824
<v Speaker 1>At some levels of analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's wrong in many other levels of </v>

1304
01:13:58.381 --> 01:14:00.330
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

1305
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:06.980
<v Speaker 1>the other thing I think that you can try</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's phenomenologically informed.</v>

1306
01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:09.810
<v Speaker 1>This is quite an interesting trick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can really,</v>

1307
01:14:09.811 --> 01:14:12.490
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard on any of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be careful if you try this.</v>

1308
01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:17.440
<v Speaker 1>So what another thing you could try for </v>
<v Speaker 1>two weeks is to watch what you say.</v>

1309
01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:19.180
<v Speaker 1>You got to detach yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1310
01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:24.510
<v Speaker 1>you have to remove the belief that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and you are the same thing.</v>

1311
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:33.790
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to watch mostly what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you say.</v>

1312
01:14:34.330 --> 01:14:35.163
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something that Rogers would </v>

1313
01:14:37.541 --> 01:14:39.430
<v Speaker 1>also be an advocate of.</v>

1314
01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:40.473
<v Speaker 1>You have to see if what you say it makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel what you have to see if what </v>

1315
01:14:44.531 --> 01:14:48.010
<v Speaker 1>you say improves the quality of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>being or makes it worse.</v>

1316
01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:49.353
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you start believing in what you say </v>

1317
01:14:51.611 --> 01:14:54.370
<v Speaker 1>and watch what the consequences are </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead,</v>

1318
01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:58.540
<v Speaker 1>how it manifests itself in terms of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation of being,</v>

1319
01:14:58.750 --> 01:14:59.583
<v Speaker 1>then you can also learn how to only say </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that improve the quality of </v>

1320
01:15:03.191 --> 01:15:04.330
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1321
01:15:04.331 --> 01:15:05.980
<v Speaker 1>that's a good thing if you can manage </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1322
01:15:05.981 --> 01:15:07.510
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

1323
01:15:07.511 --> 01:15:08.344
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's terrifying in some sense because </v>

1324
01:15:09.911 --> 01:15:10.744
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you'll find is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that hardly anything that you say does </v>

1325
01:15:13.541 --> 01:15:14.374
<v Speaker 1>that most of it's neutral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a fair bit of it has exactly the </v>

1326
01:15:17.291 --> 01:15:20.650
<v Speaker 1>opposite consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes things worse.</v>

1327
01:15:21.490 --> 01:15:22.323
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I mentioned that the word </v>

1328
01:15:25.901 --> 01:15:28.450
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where the phenomenology,</v>

1329
01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:29.323
<v Speaker 1>the term phenomenology comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously the term phenomena means is </v>

1330
01:15:33.491 --> 01:15:37.900
<v Speaker 1>from the Greek word famous thigh and </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous thigh means to shine forth.</v>

1331
01:15:38.410 --> 01:15:39.243
<v Speaker 1>And so the phenomenologies </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists argument is that like </v>

1332
01:15:43.811 --> 01:15:44.644
<v Speaker 1>being is made up of meanings that shine </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth for you and that those different </v>

1333
01:15:47.831 --> 01:15:50.020
<v Speaker 1>meanings attract you there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1334
01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:52.390
<v Speaker 1>they're like guideposts that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow.</v>

1335
01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:53.920
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>

1336
01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:56.560
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed this for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to reading,</v>

1337
01:15:56.890 --> 01:16:01.270
<v Speaker 1>so I'll be reading a complex text and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some passage will really strike me.</v>

1338
01:16:01.271 --> 01:16:04.600
<v Speaker 1>So it manifests itself is meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

1339
01:16:05.230 --> 01:16:06.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1340
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:10.060
<v Speaker 1>one of the phenomenologists which would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be being been swagger,</v>

1341
01:16:10.061 --> 01:16:10.571
<v Speaker 1>we'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1342
01:16:10.571 --> 01:16:12.690
<v Speaker 1>it's because of the way that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>structured.</v>

1343
01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:14.470
<v Speaker 1>But boss would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

1344
01:16:14.710 --> 01:16:19.120
<v Speaker 1>it's a dance that's occurring within the</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of everything.</v>

1345
01:16:19.121 --> 01:16:19.954
<v Speaker 1>And the consequence of that is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestation manifestation of this </v>

1346
01:16:22.991 --> 01:16:23.824
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well what I've found is that I can </v>

1347
01:16:25.901 --> 01:16:26.734
<v Speaker 1>follow threads of meaning through books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that it's like it's something </v>

1348
01:16:30.461 --> 01:16:32.380
<v Speaker 1>that's guiding me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sense of meaning.</v>

1349
01:16:32.650 --> 01:16:36.220
<v Speaker 1>And often if I find something within a </v>
<v Speaker 1>book that's meaningful,</v>

1350
01:16:36.221 --> 01:16:37.054
<v Speaker 1>then I'll read the other things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that person wrote and all see that some </v>

1351
01:16:40.541 --> 01:16:41.374
<v Speaker 1>of the people that they read have </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful things to say and then I can </v>

1352
01:16:44.111 --> 01:16:48.460
<v Speaker 1>branch out that network and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's following a pathway that's laid out</v>

1353
01:16:48.461 --> 01:16:51.100
<v Speaker 1>for you in some sense that's laid out </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you in the world.</v>

1354
01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:55.420
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenological idea is that if you</v>

1355
01:16:55.421 --> 01:16:56.254
<v Speaker 1>follow that pathway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what happens is being becomes more </v>

1356
01:17:01.451 --> 01:17:06.451
<v Speaker 1>and more integrated around you and those</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences of,</v>

1357
01:17:07.810 --> 01:17:11.960
<v Speaker 1>of intrinsic meaning start to multiply </v>
<v Speaker 1>and increase in intensity.</v>

1358
01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:12.794
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're able to do that over a long </v>

1359
01:17:15.021 --> 01:17:15.854
<v Speaker 1>period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can get more and more of the </v>

1360
01:17:19.041 --> 01:17:22.940
<v Speaker 1>totality of your being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>revealing the kind of meanings that stop</v>

1361
01:17:22.941 --> 01:17:26.050
<v Speaker 1>you from being either nihilistic or </v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian.</v>

1362
01:17:26.890 --> 01:17:28.070
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1363
01:17:28.071 --> 01:17:28.904
<v Speaker 1>that's the basic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the fundamental theory of </v>

1364
01:17:30.891 --> 01:17:32.810
<v Speaker 1>phenomenological psychotherapy.</v>

1365
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:34.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might first say,</v>

1366
01:17:34.431 --> 01:17:35.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1367
01:17:35.481 --> 01:17:38.360
<v Speaker 1>you're depressed and anxious and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life isn't going very well.</v>

1368
01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:41.180
<v Speaker 1>What keeps you afloat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an,</v>

1369
01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:43.850
<v Speaker 1>it's something to observe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we might say,</v>

1370
01:17:43.851 --> 01:17:44.684
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are there ways that we can expand that </v>
