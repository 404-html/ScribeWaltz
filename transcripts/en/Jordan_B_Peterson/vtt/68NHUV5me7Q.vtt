6
00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:28.224
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That has been the traditional land of </v>

7

<v Speaker 1>Today.</v>

9
00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:38.124
<v Speaker 1>This meeting place is still the home to </v>
<v Speaker 1>many indigenous people from across </v>

10
00:00:41.671 --> 00:00:46.260
<v Speaker 1>turtle island and we are grateful for </v>

<v Speaker 1>As most of you will know,</v>

16
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.083

<v Speaker 1>exploration of the issues in play.</v>

20
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.243
<v Speaker 1>We ask everyone to engage with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues and with one another in a spirit </v>

21
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.853

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.260
<v Speaker 2>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Professor,</v>

91
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.140
<v Speaker 3>thank you very much Dean Cameron and </v>
<v Speaker 3>welcome to everyone.</v>

92
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.280
<v Speaker 3>I have a little bit of Laryngitis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so please excuse me if my voice isn't as</v>

93
00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:36.380
<v Speaker 3>strong as usual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>

95
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.753
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>today is designed as an academic </v>

96
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.050
<v Speaker 3>discussion as Dean Cameron said on </v>
<v Speaker 3>issues arising out of the current debate</v>

97
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.913
<v Speaker 3>on the provisions of Bill See 16 and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>gender provisions of the Ontario Human </v>

98
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.080

<v Speaker 3>Critically examining and in our hope </v>
<v Speaker 3>illuminating the great policy issues of </v>

101
00:06:57.761 --> 00:07:00.550
<v Speaker 3>the day is a vital role for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>university.</v>

102
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.013
<v Speaker 3>The university is uniquely well situated</v>
<v Speaker 3>because within the confines of the </v>

103
00:07:06.221 --> 00:07:09.580
<v Speaker 3>university we have people as students </v>
<v Speaker 3>would know,</v>

104
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:10.563
<v Speaker 3>who are experts on every possible topic </v>
<v Speaker 3>and who have devoted their lives to </v>

105
00:07:14.711 --> 00:07:15.544
<v Speaker 3>understanding those topics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the university is probably the best </v>

106
00:07:19.691 --> 00:07:21.200
<v Speaker 3>possible place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

108
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.380
<v Speaker 3>and discussion and to critically </v>

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:30.263
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the public arguments in light of fact </v>

<v Speaker 3>And that is the spirit in which we </v>

<v Speaker 3>in pursuing that mission,</v>

115
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.890
<v Speaker 3>as Dean Cameron said,</v>

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:57.260
<v Speaker 3>We acknowledge of course that sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 3>those principles are intention with each</v>

119
00:07:57.261 --> 00:07:58.094
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But respect for both is absolutely </v>

120
00:07:59.661 --> 00:08:02.150
<v Speaker 3>critical to the mission of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>university.</v>

121
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:03.883
<v Speaker 3>I would like to begin by acknowledging </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the subject matter that we're </v>

122
00:08:06.561 --> 00:08:07.394
<v Speaker 3>discussing today may be difficult and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that audience members and indeed </v>

123
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.013
<v Speaker 3>participants will have strong feelings </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the subject matter that we're </v>

124
00:08:15.051 --> 00:08:16.450
<v Speaker 3>discussing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

125
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:17.383
<v Speaker 3>we have arranged for support for anyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>who would like it just outside the room </v>

126
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.153
<v Speaker 3>and bearing in mind the nature of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussion that we're having and our </v>

127
00:08:25.821 --> 00:08:26.654
<v Speaker 3>objectives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are two aluminate discuss and </v>

128
00:08:28.371 --> 00:08:29.204
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would ask that members of the </v>

129
00:08:30.951 --> 00:08:33.800
<v Speaker 3>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you don't agree with some of the</v>

130
00:08:33.801 --> 00:08:37.250
<v Speaker 3>speakers to please allow them to voice </v>
<v Speaker 3>their opinions.</v>

131
00:08:37.251 --> 00:08:39.800
<v Speaker 3>There will be time for questions at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>end.</v>

132
00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:41.070
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

133
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:44.100
<v Speaker 3>I now like to just say a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things about how we plan to,</v>

134
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:44.850
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

135
00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:45.683
<v Speaker 3>how we constructed the forum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we did a in dialogue with the </v>

136
00:08:48.451 --> 00:08:50.190
<v Speaker 3>participants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

137
00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.500
<v Speaker 3>so we're going to begin by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

138
00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.440
<v Speaker 3>having,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

139
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:55.423
<v Speaker 3>it'll be hundred minutes long and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first segment we'll discuss the </v>

140
00:08:58.501 --> 00:08:59.334
<v Speaker 3>provisions of bill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See 16 in the Ontario Human Rights Code </v>

141
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:06.690
<v Speaker 3>and we'll focus especially on freedom of</v>
<v Speaker 3>expression and human rights law.</v>

142
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:07.913
<v Speaker 3>In that first segment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we will begin with Professor Peterson </v>

143
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:11.603
<v Speaker 3>who will speak for 10 minutes followed </v>
<v Speaker 3>by Professor Cossman who will speak for </v>

144
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:19.290
<v Speaker 3>10 minutes and we do have a timekeeper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you wave your hand?</v>

145
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.590
<v Speaker 3>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

146
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.580
<v Speaker 3>just to ensure we're trying to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>

147
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.200
<v Speaker 3>obviously we know there's lots to say on</v>
<v Speaker 3>these topics.</v>

148
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.153
<v Speaker 3>We're going to try to make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've divided the time up and allocated </v>

149
00:09:28.531 --> 00:09:29.364
<v Speaker 3>it as fairly as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the second segment of this </v>

150
00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:34.104
<v Speaker 3>discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're again focusing on [inaudible] on </v>

151
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.830
<v Speaker 3>the Ontario human rights code w we'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>focus more on academic freedom,</v>

152
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:41.693
<v Speaker 3>gender diversity and the implications </v>
<v Speaker 3>for scholarship and teaching in that </v>

153
00:09:45.511 --> 00:09:46.050
<v Speaker 3>segment.</v>

154
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:46.883
<v Speaker 3>Professor Peterson will again begin and </v>
<v Speaker 3>professor Bryson will follow and they </v>

155
00:09:50.761 --> 00:09:53.730
<v Speaker 3>will have 10 minutes each.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Following that,</v>

156
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.593
<v Speaker 3>I will have a short a period to just ask</v>
<v Speaker 3>some clarifying questions of the </v>

157
00:09:58.411 --> 00:09:59.244
<v Speaker 3>speakers and I've agreed with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>speaker so we'll keep our answers to </v>

158
00:10:03.421 --> 00:10:04.254
<v Speaker 3>three minutes each.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won't ask questions that are longer </v>

159
00:10:06.061 --> 00:10:06.894
<v Speaker 3>than three minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just again in an effort to ensure that </v>

160
00:10:09.001 --> 00:10:09.834
<v Speaker 3>we have as much opportunity to air some </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the issues that people might be </v>

161
00:10:13.411 --> 00:10:16.500
<v Speaker 3>thinking about as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Following that,</v>

162
00:10:16.501 --> 00:10:19.290
<v Speaker 3>we'll have 30 minutes for questions from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the audience.</v>

163
00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:24.291
<v Speaker 3>You can see up here that you can email </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions to that email address.</v>

164
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.800
<v Speaker 3>If you don't have email here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

165
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:27.893
<v Speaker 3>we have pencil and paper and people will</v>
<v Speaker 3>go around and gather questions and then </v>

166
00:10:31.741 --> 00:10:32.574
<v Speaker 3>we'll have some people curate the </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions and bring them back to me and </v>

167
00:10:35.071 --> 00:10:39.570
<v Speaker 3>I will ask them again in an effort to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get as many of the issues as possible on</v>

168
00:10:39.571 --> 00:10:42.600
<v Speaker 3>the table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the speakers have all agreed kindly.</v>

169
00:10:42.601 --> 00:10:43.434
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll keep their answers to three </v>

170
00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:47.820
<v Speaker 3>minutes each.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So thank you all very much.</v>

171
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.200
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and with that,</v>

172
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.330
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like to begin and uh,</v>

173
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.080
<v Speaker 3>I will ask a professor Peterson to </v>
<v Speaker 3>start.</v>

174
00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.610
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thanks.</v>

175
00:10:58.390 --> 00:10:59.240
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

176
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:00.203
<v Speaker 4>I'd like if you wouldn't mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd like the audience to do something </v>

177
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:04.733
<v Speaker 4>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first thing I'd like them to do if </v>

178
00:11:07.171 --> 00:11:08.004
<v Speaker 4>you would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is if all the women in the audience </v>

179
00:11:09.391 --> 00:11:11.490
<v Speaker 4>would stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would be much appreciated.</v>

180
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.863
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

181
00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.370
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

182
00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:21.040
<v Speaker 4>thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now perhaps all the men would stand up.</v>

183
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:26.583
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

184
00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:27.423
<v Speaker 4>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did a rough count when I came in here </v>

185
00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.540
<v Speaker 4>and I might be out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not out by March.</v>

186
00:11:31.541 --> 00:11:33.490
<v Speaker 4>I think it's about two to one males in </v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

187
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:37.930
<v Speaker 4>And I thought I'd point that out because</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

188
00:11:37.931 --> 00:11:38.764
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of interesting to me because </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a personality psychologist and this </v>

189
00:11:42.611 --> 00:11:46.570
<v Speaker 4>debate is about ideas and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>personality trait called openness,</v>

190
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:47.463
<v Speaker 4>which is associated with intellect and </v>
<v Speaker 4>creativity and there are pronounced </v>

191
00:11:50.951 --> 00:11:55.951
<v Speaker 4>gender differences in openness such that</v>
<v Speaker 4>men are higher and intellect,</v>

192
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:56.973
<v Speaker 4>which encompasses interest in ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 4>women are hiring is theoretics which </v>

193
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.240
<v Speaker 4>encompasses interest in while in art and</v>
<v Speaker 4>literature and that sort of thing.</v>

194
00:12:04.241 --> 00:12:08.500
<v Speaker 4>And it's partly for that reason that men</v>
<v Speaker 4>read more nonfiction and women read more</v>

195
00:12:08.501 --> 00:12:09.334
<v Speaker 4>fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I just wanted to point out that </v>

196
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.943
<v Speaker 4>there was a natural gender divide that </v>
<v Speaker 4>occurred automatically and without </v>

197
00:12:15.911 --> 00:12:16.744
<v Speaker 4>compulsion in this particular case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the case of this debate and that the </v>

198
00:12:20.111 --> 00:12:21.770
<v Speaker 4>more our society,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

199
00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:22.663
<v Speaker 4>enforces,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's increasingly absurd demands for </v>

200
00:12:25.061 --> 00:12:25.894
<v Speaker 4>equity upon everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the less likely it is that such natural </v>

201
00:12:28.451 --> 00:12:30.890
<v Speaker 4>divisions will be able to manifest them </v>
<v Speaker 4>in ours,</v>

202
00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:31.803
<v Speaker 4>manifest themselves in our society,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in keeping with the pronounced in deep </v>

203
00:12:34.961 --> 00:12:36.640
<v Speaker 4>differences between the genders.</v>

204
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:40.630
<v Speaker 4>So I just thought that makes an </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting initial,</v>

205
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.610
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you call it?</v>

206
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.550
<v Speaker 4>Real world demonstration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

207
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:46.563
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So about two months ago made these </v>

208
00:12:48.791 --> 00:12:49.750
<v Speaker 4>videos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

209
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:53.380
<v Speaker 4>I did it because I was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>articulate my concerns.</v>

210
00:12:53.381 --> 00:12:54.250
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

211
00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:55.323
<v Speaker 4>for a variety of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been keeping an eye on political </v>

212
00:12:56.921 --> 00:13:01.030
<v Speaker 4>correctness for a long time and I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>also very upset with the human resources</v>

213
00:13:01.031 --> 00:13:01.864
<v Speaker 4>and Equity Department's decision to make</v>
<v Speaker 4>antiracism so-called antiracism and </v>

214
00:13:05.771 --> 00:13:07.870
<v Speaker 4>antibiose training mandatory for their </v>
<v Speaker 4>staff,</v>

215
00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:11.830
<v Speaker 4>which I regard as an unacceptable </v>
<v Speaker 4>intrusion into their staffs,</v>

216
00:13:11.831 --> 00:13:12.664
<v Speaker 4>right to their political opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as well as noting that there's </v>

217
00:13:14.921 --> 00:13:15.754
<v Speaker 4>absolutely no evidence whatsoever that </v>
<v Speaker 4>mandatory anti racism and anti bias </v>

218
00:13:18.701 --> 00:13:21.370
<v Speaker 4>training has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's has the impact that is claimed.</v>

219
00:13:21.371 --> 00:13:22.204
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the empirical evidence suggests quite </v>

220
00:13:23.441 --> 00:13:25.840
<v Speaker 4>the contrary when you mandate that sort </v>
<v Speaker 4>of thing,</v>

221
00:13:25.841 --> 00:13:27.700
<v Speaker 4>you actually make more people more </v>
<v Speaker 4>prejudiced.</v>

222
00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:33.060
<v Speaker 4>It's also based on what I would say is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>rather pernicious form of pseudo science</v>

223
00:13:33.821 --> 00:13:34.654
<v Speaker 4>that's being promoted by social </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychologists to group that I have a </v>

224
00:13:36.701 --> 00:13:37.534
<v Speaker 4>fair bit of trouble with and that's been</v>
<v Speaker 4>transformed into a kind of educational </v>

225
00:13:40.631 --> 00:13:43.810
<v Speaker 4>fascism that has no grounding whatsoever</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the empirical literature.</v>

226
00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.720
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happened as a consequence of making</v>

227
00:13:46.721 --> 00:13:48.310
<v Speaker 4>these videos was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

228
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.510
<v Speaker 4>was really quite unexpected to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There.</v>

229
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:52.360
<v Speaker 4>We've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've been trying to keep count,</v>

230
00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:55.690
<v Speaker 4>there's been 140 print articles </v>
<v Speaker 4>published about this,</v>

231
00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:00.320
<v Speaker 4>whatever this is in the last two months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then dozens and dozens of,</v>

232
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:01.183
<v Speaker 4>of youtube videos and television </v>
<v Speaker 4>interviews and radio interviews and </v>

233
00:14:04.481 --> 00:14:07.480
<v Speaker 4>demonstrations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Millions of people have been tuning into</v>

234
00:14:07.481 --> 00:14:08.314
<v Speaker 4>this online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so obviously something's up and I </v>

235
00:14:11.411 --> 00:14:12.244
<v Speaker 4>can tell you that what's up isn't only a</v>
<v Speaker 4>discussion about bill see 16 and about </v>

236
00:14:15.971 --> 00:14:17.350
<v Speaker 4>gendered pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

237
00:14:17.351 --> 00:14:18.184
<v Speaker 4>sometimes when you're having a debate or</v>
<v Speaker 4>discussion with someone that you love </v>

238
00:14:20.561 --> 00:14:21.394
<v Speaker 4>and you're having a little argument </v>
<v Speaker 4>about something like who's going to do </v>

239
00:14:23.621 --> 00:14:27.160
<v Speaker 4>the dishes or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or you know how it,</v>

240
00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:30.430
<v Speaker 4>especially if you haven't been getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>along very well with that person,</v>

241
00:14:30.431 --> 00:14:31.264
<v Speaker 4>you know how the discussion starts with </v>
<v Speaker 4>something specific and then you start </v>

242
00:14:34.361 --> 00:14:38.140
<v Speaker 4>trading all the things that it might be </v>
<v Speaker 4>about until you're arguing about,</v>

243
00:14:38.141 --> 00:14:38.974
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way that you behaved on your third </v>

244
00:14:40.991 --> 00:14:41.591
<v Speaker 4>date,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

245
00:14:41.591 --> 00:14:42.460
<v Speaker 4>10 years ago.</v>

246
00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:43.293
<v Speaker 4>And the whole underlying unresolved </v>
<v Speaker 4>chaos of your relationship emerges </v>

247
00:14:47.501 --> 00:14:50.500
<v Speaker 4>through the little portal that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>defined by the argument,</v>

248
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:52.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's what this is about.</v>

249
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:54.560
<v Speaker 4>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the Hell's going on here?</v>

250
00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:55.670
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And why are we,</v>

251
00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.650
<v Speaker 4>are we damn near at each other's </v>
<v Speaker 4>throats?</v>

252
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.560
<v Speaker 4>Look at what happened in the United </v>
<v Speaker 4>States a week and a half ago.</v>

253
00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:02.840
<v Speaker 4>There's been things to talk about here </v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

254
00:15:02.841 --> 00:15:06.950
<v Speaker 4>I started to try to talk about the men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say that my freedom to do so was</v>

255
00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:10.160
<v Speaker 4>rapidly infringed upon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My career was put at risk.</v>

256
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:11.383
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I find this absolutely unacceptable </v>

257
00:15:13.671 --> 00:15:16.250
<v Speaker 4>because I am trying to sort this out and</v>
<v Speaker 4>believe me,</v>

258
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.560
<v Speaker 4>you know what you call people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't talk to</v>

259
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:20.923
<v Speaker 4>enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if we want to divide our society </v>

260
00:15:24.081 --> 00:15:24.914
<v Speaker 4>into armed camps of enmity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all we have to do is keep doing what </v>

261
00:15:29.241 --> 00:15:30.074
<v Speaker 4>we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I would recommend that we don't do </v>

262
00:15:31.521 --> 00:15:31.910
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

263
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:35.000
<v Speaker 4>I've studied authoritarianism for a very</v>
<v Speaker 4>long time.</v>

264
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:36.133
<v Speaker 4>I know what happens when things get out </v>
<v Speaker 4>of control and it can happen </v>

265
00:15:38.151 --> 00:15:38.984
<v Speaker 4>extraordinarily rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I would say we're on the cusp of </v>

266
00:15:41.931 --> 00:15:42.764
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we need to start talking and </v>

267
00:15:44.631 --> 00:15:46.310
<v Speaker 4>listening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you talk,</v>

268
00:15:46.311 --> 00:15:48.410
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't mean you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean you're correct,</v>

269
00:15:48.411 --> 00:15:49.940
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It means you're trying to articulate and</v>

270
00:15:49.941 --> 00:15:50.774
<v Speaker 4>formulate your thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the bone headed more on that you </v>

271
00:15:52.431 --> 00:15:53.264
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're going to stumble around </v>

272
00:15:54.441 --> 00:15:56.750
<v Speaker 4>idiotically because what the hell do you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know?</v>

273
00:15:56.751 --> 00:15:57.584
<v Speaker 4>You're full of biases and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>ignorant than you can't speak very well </v>

274
00:15:59.841 --> 00:16:00.674
<v Speaker 4>and you're over emotional and you know </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got just problems that you can </v>

275
00:16:03.231 --> 00:16:04.064
<v Speaker 4>hardly even imagine that are interfering</v>
<v Speaker 4>with your ability to state something </v>

276
00:16:06.951 --> 00:16:07.784
<v Speaker 4>clear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so what you do is you do your best </v>

277
00:16:08.871 --> 00:16:09.704
<v Speaker 4>to say what you mean and then you listen</v>
<v Speaker 4>to other people tell you why you're a </v>

278
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:13.760
<v Speaker 4>blithering idiot.</v>

279
00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:14.593
<v Speaker 4>And hopefully you can correct yourself </v>
<v Speaker 4>to some degree as a consequence of </v>

280
00:16:17.271 --> 00:16:18.104
<v Speaker 4>listening to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you see that's what free speech is </v>

281
00:16:19.701 --> 00:16:23.090
<v Speaker 4>about because you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

282
00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.013
<v Speaker 4>it isn't just the people can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can organize themselves and their </v>

283
00:16:26.601 --> 00:16:29.690
<v Speaker 4>societies by thinking you can't do that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's only one of you.</v>

284
00:16:29.691 --> 00:16:30.524
<v Speaker 4>What you have to do is you have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>articulate your thoughts in a public </v>

285
00:16:32.541 --> 00:16:33.374
<v Speaker 4>forum so that other people can attack </v>
<v Speaker 4>you and hopefully in a corrective </v>

286
00:16:36.111 --> 00:16:37.520
<v Speaker 4>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you want to,</v>

287
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:39.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>step back a little bit and think,</v>

288
00:16:39.441 --> 00:16:40.274
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you know I was a little arrogant </v>

289
00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:43.910
<v Speaker 4>there and I was a little over emotional </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and I didn't get that quite right.</v>

290
00:16:43.911 --> 00:16:46.640
<v Speaker 4>And maybe I'm outright biased on that </v>
<v Speaker 4>front.</v>

291
00:16:46.641 --> 00:16:48.950
<v Speaker 4>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to correct what you say because</v>

292
00:16:48.951 --> 00:16:52.670
<v Speaker 4>then you correct how you are and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>you correct how you act in life and then</v>

293
00:16:52.671 --> 00:16:54.070
<v Speaker 4>you correct your society.</v>

294
00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:57.410
<v Speaker 4>And to the degree that we limit free </v>
<v Speaker 4>freedom of expression,</v>

295
00:16:57.411 --> 00:16:59.450
<v Speaker 4>we put all of that at risk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

296
00:16:59.451 --> 00:17:02.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm a clinical psychologist and one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the things,</v>

297
00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.013
<v Speaker 4>there's two things that we kind of know </v>
<v Speaker 4>about why clinical psychology works and </v>

298
00:17:05.421 --> 00:17:06.254
<v Speaker 4>one is that people get stronger if they </v>
<v Speaker 4>voluntarily expose themselves to things </v>

299
00:17:09.741 --> 00:17:11.630
<v Speaker 4>they're afraid of and that they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>disgusted by.</v>

300
00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:12.733
<v Speaker 4>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a hallmark of clinical </v>

301
00:17:13.701 --> 00:17:14.534
<v Speaker 4>psychotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I would say it's also the defining </v>

302
00:17:15.951 --> 00:17:19.160
<v Speaker 4>characteristic of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of appropriate human adaptation,</v>

303
00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:21.530
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that you have to confront the chaotic</v>

304
00:17:21.531 --> 00:17:24.860
<v Speaker 4>things that you don't understand and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then learn to master them and articulate</v>

305
00:17:24.861 --> 00:17:25.694
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the other is that clinical </v>

306
00:17:26.781 --> 00:17:30.290
<v Speaker 4>psychotherapy works because people can </v>
<v Speaker 4>come say into my office and they can say</v>

307
00:17:30.291 --> 00:17:31.124
<v Speaker 4>whatever they have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no matter how incoherent it is or how </v>

308
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:35.203
<v Speaker 4>psychotic it is or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or how overbearing it is or confused or </v>

309
00:17:38.121 --> 00:17:38.630
<v Speaker 4>jumbled.</v>

310
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:39.463
<v Speaker 4>And sometimes it takes my clients months</v>
<v Speaker 4>or years of continual conversation just </v>

311
00:17:43.821 --> 00:17:44.654
<v Speaker 4>to start to untie the hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands of knots that have been badly </v>

312
00:17:47.871 --> 00:17:50.130
<v Speaker 4>tied in their minds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

313
00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:51.583
<v Speaker 4>and that's partly why I don't believe </v>
<v Speaker 4>that freedom of speech is just another </v>

314
00:17:53.581 --> 00:17:55.260
<v Speaker 4>value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's preposterous.</v>

315
00:17:55.261 --> 00:17:56.094
<v Speaker 4>I think that if you claim that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you know nothing about Western </v>

316
00:17:57.991 --> 00:18:02.280
<v Speaker 4>civilization and history is freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 4>speech is not just another principle.</v>

317
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:06.420
<v Speaker 4>It's the mechanism by which we keep our </v>
<v Speaker 4>psyches and our society's organized.</v>

318
00:18:06.421 --> 00:18:07.254
<v Speaker 4>And we have to be unbelievably careful </v>
<v Speaker 4>about in infringing upon that because </v>

319
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:16.170
<v Speaker 4>we're infringing upon the process by </v>
<v Speaker 4>which we keep chaos and order balanced,</v>

320
00:18:16.171 --> 00:18:17.670
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

321
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:19.740
<v Speaker 4>and if chaos and order go out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>balance,</v>

322
00:18:19.741 --> 00:18:20.574
<v Speaker 4>then then then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then all hell breaks loose and the </v>

323
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.680
<v Speaker 4>situation is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we've seen that happen many,</v>

324
00:18:25.681 --> 00:18:27.690
<v Speaker 4>many times in the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

325
00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:30.450
<v Speaker 4>Since the late 18 hundreds our </v>
<v Speaker 4>societies,</v>

326
00:18:30.451 --> 00:18:35.451
<v Speaker 4>western societies have been careening </v>
<v Speaker 4>madly between the hyper repressive order</v>

327
00:18:36.001 --> 00:18:40.110
<v Speaker 4>of the radical right and the absolute </v>
<v Speaker 4>devouring chaos of the radical left.</v>

328
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:41.123
<v Speaker 4>We've become unmoored.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've lost our bearings and the only </v>

329
00:18:44.161 --> 00:18:44.994
<v Speaker 4>thing that can possibly save us from </v>
<v Speaker 4>continuing to do exactly that is the </v>

330
00:18:48.901 --> 00:18:51.780
<v Speaker 4>dialogue of exactly the sort that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

331
00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:52.733
<v Speaker 4>I'm describing at the moment and what </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're attempting to do today in this </v>

332
00:18:55.261 --> 00:18:56.094
<v Speaker 4>forum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank God the university agreed to have </v>

333
00:18:57.541 --> 00:18:59.040
<v Speaker 4>this debate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

334
00:18:59.041 --> 00:19:01.920
<v Speaker 4>because there's things to talk about and</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we don't talk about them,</v>

335
00:19:01.921 --> 00:19:03.750
<v Speaker 4>then we're going to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

336
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:04.703
<v Speaker 4>what is this all about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can list you some of the things that </v>

337
00:19:07.441 --> 00:19:08.274
<v Speaker 4>it's about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's about inclusion versus bigotry and </v>

338
00:19:11.341 --> 00:19:12.300
<v Speaker 4>prejudice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

339
00:19:12.301 --> 00:19:14.430
<v Speaker 4>It's about the left wing versus the </v>
<v Speaker 4>right wing.</v>

340
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:18.090
<v Speaker 4>It's about who's free to choose their </v>
<v Speaker 4>language and what,</v>

341
00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.850
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what elements of respect that you're due</v>

342
00:19:20.851 --> 00:19:21.684
<v Speaker 4>to people who are different than you say</v>
<v Speaker 4>with regards to Pronoun Use are chosen </v>

343
00:19:25.051 --> 00:19:28.050
<v Speaker 4>names.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's about whether the subject of or the</v>

344
00:19:28.051 --> 00:19:28.884
<v Speaker 4>object of is going to take precedence </v>
<v Speaker 4>because implicit in bill [inaudible] 16 </v>

345
00:19:32.161 --> 00:19:35.520
<v Speaker 4>and I'm telling you there's an assault </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the idea of objectivity itself,</v>

346
00:19:35.521 --> 00:19:36.354
<v Speaker 4>an assault on the idea of biology itself</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if the university thinks that the </v>

347
00:19:39.571 --> 00:19:40.404
<v Speaker 4>sciences are going to be immune from the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ideological doctrine that's embedded in </v>

348
00:19:43.801 --> 00:19:45.840
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in these pieces of legislation,</v>

349
00:19:45.841 --> 00:19:49.080
<v Speaker 4>they better think again because there </v>
<v Speaker 4>there is trouble coming.</v>

350
00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:49.913
<v Speaker 4>I know that [inaudible] already has an </v>
<v Speaker 4>anti psychiatry program and we noticed </v>

351
00:19:52.891 --> 00:19:53.724
<v Speaker 4>the Ken Zucker got hounded out of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>job just a few years ago even though he </v>

352
00:19:56.191 --> 00:19:58.560
<v Speaker 4>was an entirely credible scientist and </v>
<v Speaker 4>clinician.</v>

353
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:04.490
<v Speaker 4>So it's about constructionism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>social constructionism versus positivism</v>

354
00:20:04.831 --> 00:20:05.664
<v Speaker 4>versus pragmatism and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a mother versus father thing </v>

355
00:20:08.401 --> 00:20:09.234
<v Speaker 4>going on here too and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you kind of saw that with Hillary </v>

356
00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.053
<v Speaker 4>Clinton versus Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say that was the overprotective </v>

357
00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:17.100
<v Speaker 4>devouring mother versus the tyrannical </v>
<v Speaker 4>father,</v>

358
00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:17.963
<v Speaker 4>which is not a good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not a good narrative from a </v>

359
00:20:20.191 --> 00:20:24.960
<v Speaker 4>mythological perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's about also the adversarial spirit I</v>

360
00:20:24.961 --> 00:20:25.794
<v Speaker 4>would say versus the logos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's at the deepest possible level of </v>

361
00:20:28.351 --> 00:20:31.890
<v Speaker 4>analysis than the adversarial spirit is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the spirit declaimed.</v>

362
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:32.873
<v Speaker 4>What I think right now is correct above </v>
<v Speaker 4>all else and I have nothing whatsoever </v>

363
00:20:37.201 --> 00:20:40.920
<v Speaker 4>to learn versus the logos and the logos </v>
<v Speaker 4>is a very complex,</v>

364
00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.680
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>idea and maybe the deepest idea of,</v>

365
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:44.790
<v Speaker 4>of humanity.</v>

366
00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:47.500
<v Speaker 4>I would say certainly the deepest idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>of western civilization.</v>

367
00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:48.573
<v Speaker 4>And that's that the proper citizen is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the person who embodies truth in speech </v>

368
00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:58.060
<v Speaker 4>and attempts to act it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that also includes listening because</v>

369
00:20:58.061 --> 00:20:59.950
<v Speaker 4>listening is part of communicative </v>
<v Speaker 4>intent.</v>

370
00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:04.960
<v Speaker 4>And I think at the moment that we're in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're embroiled in a war on every single</v>

371
00:21:04.961 --> 00:21:08.710
<v Speaker 4>one of those dimensions and several </v>
<v Speaker 4>others that I haven't had time to list.</v>

372
00:21:08.711 --> 00:21:09.544
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the evidence that we're in that sort of </v>

373
00:21:11.411 --> 00:21:14.860
<v Speaker 4>war is precisely the fact that this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>attracted so much attention.</v>

374
00:21:14.861 --> 00:21:15.694
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just sat at my bloody office at home </v>

375
00:21:16.931 --> 00:21:19.440
<v Speaker 4>and threw up a couple of amateurish </v>
<v Speaker 4>videos,</v>

376
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.313
<v Speaker 4>more or less attempting to articulate my</v>
<v Speaker 4>feelings about a couple of policies and </v>

377
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:26.200
<v Speaker 4>it's like all hell broke loose and why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

378
00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:29.500
<v Speaker 4>because that hail is right underneath </v>
<v Speaker 4>the surface.</v>

379
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:31.370
<v Speaker 4>I think to stop there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're right.</v>

380
00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:33.443
<v Speaker 6>I'm done.</v>

381
00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:40.050
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 5>thank you.</v>

382
00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:52.070
<v Speaker 6>Thank you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Professor Moran.</v>

383
00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.750
<v Speaker 6>Provost Moran.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

384
00:21:53.751 --> 00:21:54.584
<v Speaker 6>I'd like to start by saying that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 6>delighted to be here today except that </v>

385
00:21:57.891 --> 00:22:01.610
<v Speaker 6>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I'd like to start by saying how much</v>

386
00:22:01.611 --> 00:22:02.444
<v Speaker 6>I support and respect all those faculty,</v>
<v Speaker 6>staff and students who are boycotting </v>

387
00:22:05.091 --> 00:22:05.924
<v Speaker 6>today's event.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that that is also a very </v>

388
00:22:07.371 --> 00:22:08.690
<v Speaker 6>important form of speech.</v>

389
00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:13.130
<v Speaker 5>The a couple of days ago,</v>

390
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:14.063
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Oxford English dictionary announced </v>

391
00:22:16.101 --> 00:22:18.240
<v Speaker 6>the word of the year and it's post </v>
<v Speaker 6>truth.</v>

392
00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:19.693
<v Speaker 6>It's relating to or denoting </v>
<v Speaker 6>circumstances in which objective facts </v>

393
00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.473
<v Speaker 6>are less influential in shaping public </v>
<v Speaker 6>opinion than appeals to emotion and </v>

394
00:22:26.781 --> 00:22:31.610
<v Speaker 6>personal belief.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I worry about the ways that post post</v>

395
00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.473
<v Speaker 6>truth claims have been affecting public </v>
<v Speaker 6>discussions around bill see 16 around </v>

396
00:22:37.041 --> 00:22:40.340
<v Speaker 6>the Ontario human rights code and around</v>
<v Speaker 6>freedom of expression.</v>

397
00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:43.010
<v Speaker 6>There have been some profound,</v>

398
00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:44.873
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

399
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:48.630
<v Speaker 6>it's not part of my time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that little correction.</v>

400
00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.110
<v Speaker 6>There've been some profound </v>
<v Speaker 6>misunderstandings.</v>

401
00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:55.890
<v Speaker 6>I'm circulating about the law and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 6>here today as a lawyer,</v>

402
00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.620
<v Speaker 6>as a law professor,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as a civil libertarian,</v>

403
00:22:58.860 --> 00:22:59.693
<v Speaker 6>as an expert in equality rights and </v>
<v Speaker 6>freedom of expression to try to correct </v>

404
00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.473
<v Speaker 6>those misunderstandings.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So let's start with bill [inaudible] 16 </v>

405
00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.520
<v Speaker 6>which passed third reading yesterday in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the house.</v>

406
00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:11.880
<v Speaker 6>It's the proposed federal legislation </v>
<v Speaker 6>that does three things.</v>

407
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:12.833
<v Speaker 6>First,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it adds gender identity and expression </v>

408
00:23:14.671 --> 00:23:18.930
<v Speaker 6>to the Canadian human rights code.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It will prevent the Canadian government,</v>

409
00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:22.590
<v Speaker 6>federal agencies and businesses within </v>
<v Speaker 6>federal jurisdiction,</v>

410
00:23:22.591 --> 00:23:24.900
<v Speaker 6>which are quite limited banks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>telecoms,</v>

411
00:23:24.901 --> 00:23:29.901
<v Speaker 6>airlines from discriminating on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>basis of gender identity and expression.</v>

412
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.240
<v Speaker 6>This is hardly unprecedented.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Indeed.</v>

413
00:23:33.241 --> 00:23:35.010
<v Speaker 6>The federal government is late to this </v>
<v Speaker 6>game.</v>

414
00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:40.100
<v Speaker 6>I'm starting in 2002 and moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Northwest Territory's Manitoba,</v>

415
00:23:40.291 --> 00:23:41.730
<v Speaker 6>Ontario,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nova Scotia,</v>

416
00:23:41.731 --> 00:23:43.320
<v Speaker 6>Prince Edward Island,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Newfoundlands,</v>

417
00:23:43.321 --> 00:23:44.820
<v Speaker 6>Saskatchewan,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Alberta,</v>

418
00:23:44.821 --> 00:23:45.654
<v Speaker 6>Quebec,</v>
<v Speaker 6>British Columbia have already passed </v>

419
00:23:46.761 --> 00:23:47.600
<v Speaker 6>these protections.</v>

420
00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:48.883
<v Speaker 6>Ontario has had these since 2002 the </v>
<v Speaker 6>federal government here is simply </v>

421
00:23:52.191 --> 00:23:56.120
<v Speaker 6>playing catchup.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's absolutely nothing unprecedented</v>

422
00:23:56.121 --> 00:23:58.130
<v Speaker 6>in this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Number two,</v>

423
00:23:58.131 --> 00:23:58.964
<v Speaker 6>Bill See,</v>
<v Speaker 6>16 adds gender identity and gender </v>

424
00:24:00.801 --> 00:24:01.634
<v Speaker 6>expression to provisions in the criminal</v>
<v Speaker 6>code that define an identifiable group </v>

425
00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.113
<v Speaker 6>for the purposes of advocating genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The public incitement of hatred and the </v>

426
00:24:12.501 --> 00:24:17.501
<v Speaker 6>willful promotion of hatred.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So how might these provisions affect the</v>

427
00:24:18.021 --> 00:24:23.021
<v Speaker 6>use of pronouns and do these provisions </v>
<v Speaker 6>in any way criminalize the use or misuse</v>

428
00:24:23.511 --> 00:24:26.570
<v Speaker 6>of pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not even close.</v>

429
00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.393
<v Speaker 6>First,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it is absolutely not advocating </v>

430
00:24:29.961 --> 00:24:30.794
<v Speaker 6>genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now the last one wants to start talking </v>

431
00:24:33.171 --> 00:24:37.790
<v Speaker 6>about we should kill all the axes then </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's advocating genocide,</v>

432
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.170
<v Speaker 6>but pronoun use nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Close public incitement of hatred.</v>

433
00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:43.693
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the provisions of the Criminal Code </v>

434
00:24:44.541 --> 00:24:48.740
<v Speaker 6>requires that the incitement is likely </v>
<v Speaker 6>to lead to a breach of the peace.</v>

435
00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.420
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>does that sound subjective?</v>

436
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:51.583
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Supreme Court of Canada has said </v>

437
00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.310
<v Speaker 6>there's a very clear,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a very clear definition.</v>

438
00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.920
<v Speaker 6>The threshold is violence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In fact,</v>

439
00:24:57.921 --> 00:25:02.750
<v Speaker 6>there has to be personal violence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It is an extremely high threshold,</v>

440
00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:03.883
<v Speaker 6>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the misuse of pronouns doesn't come </v>

441
00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:09.320
<v Speaker 6>anywhere close.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Finally,</v>

442
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:10.183
<v Speaker 6>the willful promotion of hatred,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so called hate speech provisions now </v>

443
00:25:13.281 --> 00:25:16.760
<v Speaker 6>hates be provisions in the criminal code</v>
<v Speaker 6>have a very,</v>

444
00:25:16.761 --> 00:25:17.594
<v Speaker 6>very high threshold.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Supreme Court of Canada has </v>

445
00:25:20.301 --> 00:25:21.134
<v Speaker 6>repeatedly defined hate speech as only </v>
<v Speaker 6>including the most extreme forms of </v>

446
00:25:25.281 --> 00:25:28.490
<v Speaker 6>speech the court has said over and over </v>
<v Speaker 6>again.</v>

447
00:25:28.491 --> 00:25:29.324
<v Speaker 6>And I quote it is quote the unusually </v>
<v Speaker 6>strong and deep felt emotions of </v>

448
00:25:34.011 --> 00:25:38.480
<v Speaker 6>vilification and detestation the court </v>
<v Speaker 6>has said it is not disdain,</v>

449
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:39.343
<v Speaker 6>it is not dislike,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it is not offense plus something that's </v>

450
00:25:42.951 --> 00:25:44.690
<v Speaker 6>often lost.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hate speech.</v>

451
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:49.310
<v Speaker 6>Criminal charges cannot be laid without </v>
<v Speaker 6>the approval of the attorney general.</v>

452
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.353
<v Speaker 6>So this is a high threshold.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They are very difficult charges to </v>

453
00:25:53.211 --> 00:25:55.340
<v Speaker 6>bring.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Third Bill,</v>

454
00:25:55.341 --> 00:25:56.174
<v Speaker 6>see 16 adds gender identity and </v>
<v Speaker 6>expression to the provisions of the </v>

455
00:25:59.241 --> 00:26:02.150
<v Speaker 6>criminal code that deal with sentencing </v>
<v Speaker 6>for hate crimes.</v>

456
00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:03.643
<v Speaker 6>Now here under this particular section </v>
<v Speaker 6>seven 18 to a one w we tend to be </v>

457
00:26:08.391 --> 00:26:10.250
<v Speaker 6>concerned about numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

458
00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.710
<v Speaker 6>evidence that an offense is motivated by</v>
<v Speaker 6>bias,</v>

459
00:26:12.711 --> 00:26:15.260
<v Speaker 6>prejudice or hatred can be taken into </v>
<v Speaker 6>account.</v>

460
00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:16.123
<v Speaker 6>In sentencing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we already take a range of things into </v>

461
00:26:18.471 --> 00:26:19.520
<v Speaker 6>account,</v>
<v Speaker 6>race,</v>

462
00:26:19.521 --> 00:26:21.860
<v Speaker 6>national and ethnic origin,</v>
<v Speaker 6>religion,</v>

463
00:26:21.861 --> 00:26:23.330
<v Speaker 6>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 6>age and others.</v>

464
00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:24.403
<v Speaker 6>So now evidence of hatred on the basis </v>
<v Speaker 6>of gender identity and expression could </v>

465
00:26:28.821 --> 00:26:29.654
<v Speaker 6>be taken into account.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's important to emphasize section </v>

466
00:26:32.961 --> 00:26:36.140
<v Speaker 6>seven 18 does not create any new </v>
<v Speaker 6>offenses.</v>

467
00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:37.213
<v Speaker 6>It simply means that any existing </v>
<v Speaker 6>offense in the criminal code like </v>

468
00:26:40.041 --> 00:26:45.041
<v Speaker 6>assault or sexual assault or murder,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if it's motivated by hatred,</v>

469
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:50.270
<v Speaker 6>could be given an increased sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This has no impact on pronouns unless of</v>

470
00:26:51.571 --> 00:26:52.404
<v Speaker 6>course,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and accused was misusing pronouns while </v>

471
00:26:55.231 --> 00:26:58.500
<v Speaker 6>assaulting sexually assaulting or </v>
<v Speaker 6>murdering someone.</v>

472
00:26:59.100 --> 00:26:59.933
<v Speaker 6>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's nothing in Bilski 16 that comes </v>

473
00:27:02.221 --> 00:27:04.950
<v Speaker 6>close to criminalizing the misuse of </v>
<v Speaker 6>pronouns.</v>

474
00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:06.870
<v Speaker 6>Nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not hate speech,</v>

475
00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:07.973
<v Speaker 6>not hate crime.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now let's look at the Ontario Human </v>

476
00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.053
<v Speaker 6>Rights Code.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the Ontario Human Rights Code is a </v>

477
00:27:13.801 --> 00:27:17.790
<v Speaker 6>provincial law that protects individuals</v>
<v Speaker 6>from discrimination in housing,</v>

478
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.990
<v Speaker 6>Employment Services,</v>
<v Speaker 6>vocational associations and contracts.</v>

479
00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:25.740
<v Speaker 6>It's not constitutional law,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which limits government action.</v>

480
00:27:25.741 --> 00:27:29.880
<v Speaker 6>It's not criminal law where the state </v>
<v Speaker 6>prosecutes individuals and sends them to</v>

481
00:27:29.881 --> 00:27:30.714
<v Speaker 6>jail.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a type of civil law where private </v>

482
00:27:32.551 --> 00:27:35.100
<v Speaker 6>individuals can sue one another.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

483
00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.830
<v Speaker 6>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the remedy is generally damages.</v>

484
00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.640
<v Speaker 6>The Ontario Human Rights Code was first </v>
<v Speaker 6>passed in 1962.</v>

485
00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:45.270
<v Speaker 6>It protects people from all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 6>discrimination.</v>

486
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:46.133
<v Speaker 6>It protects people from being fired on </v>
<v Speaker 6>the basis of their race or it protects </v>

487
00:27:49.801 --> 00:27:50.634
<v Speaker 6>people from being denied housing on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>basis of their religion or it protects </v>

488
00:27:54.331 --> 00:27:58.800
<v Speaker 6>people from being called the n word or </v>
<v Speaker 6>any other racial epithet in the delivery</v>

489
00:27:58.801 --> 00:28:03.801
<v Speaker 6>of services like a university classroom.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Since 2012 the Ontario Human Rights Code</v>

490
00:28:04.921 --> 00:28:05.754
<v Speaker 6>has prohibited discrimination and </v>
<v Speaker 6>harassment on the basis of gender </v>

491
00:28:08.731 --> 00:28:09.870
<v Speaker 6>identity and expression.</v>

492
00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:11.243
<v Speaker 6>It prevents discrimination and </v>
<v Speaker 6>harassment against Trans and gender non </v>

493
00:28:13.921 --> 00:28:16.830
<v Speaker 6>binary individuals in employment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>housing and services.</v>

494
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:19.890
<v Speaker 6>So what does this require in relation to</v>
<v Speaker 6>pronouns?</v>

495
00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:25.410
<v Speaker 6>According to the Ontario Human Rights </v>
<v Speaker 6>Commission's policy section 7.4,</v>

496
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:26.423
<v Speaker 6>it specifically said that refusing to </v>
<v Speaker 6>refer to a person by their self </v>

497
00:28:29.311 --> 00:28:34.311
<v Speaker 6>identified name or proper Pronoun could </v>
<v Speaker 6>constitute gender based harassment.</v>

498
00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:35.573
<v Speaker 6>And as a result of some q and a's that </v>
<v Speaker 6>were released yesterday by the </v>

499
00:28:39.181 --> 00:28:39.990
<v Speaker 6>commission,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

500
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:42.900
<v Speaker 6>clarifying this question of Gender </v>
<v Speaker 6>Pronoun use,</v>

501
00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:44.123
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

502
00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:44.963
<v Speaker 6>they stated the following,</v>
<v Speaker 6>refusing to refer to a trans person by </v>

503
00:28:48.241 --> 00:28:49.074
<v Speaker 6>their chosen name and a personal pronoun</v>
<v Speaker 6>that matches their gender identity or </v>

504
00:28:52.951 --> 00:28:53.784
<v Speaker 6>purposely misgendering will likely be </v>
<v Speaker 6>discrimination when it takes place in a </v>

505
00:28:57.371 --> 00:28:59.250
<v Speaker 6>social arena.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Covered by the code,</v>

506
00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:03.480
<v Speaker 6>including employment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>housing services like education,</v>

507
00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.780
<v Speaker 6>but about gender neutral pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

508
00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:07.643
<v Speaker 6>the commission has said the Ontario </v>
<v Speaker 6>Human Rights Code does not require any </v>

509
00:29:10.621 --> 00:29:14.190
<v Speaker 6>particular gender neutral pronoun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If in doubt,</v>

510
00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.350
<v Speaker 6>ask the person how they wish to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>addressed.</v>

511
00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:20.070
<v Speaker 6>Use they if you don't know or simply use</v>
<v Speaker 6>their chosen name.</v>

512
00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.640
<v Speaker 6>So what it seems to require is the use </v>
<v Speaker 6>of he,</v>

513
00:29:23.641 --> 00:29:26.580
<v Speaker 6>she or they.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if you don't like that,</v>

514
00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:27.743
<v Speaker 6>then you can always just use their name.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There is no question of the 31 flavors </v>

515
00:29:32.041 --> 00:29:34.710
<v Speaker 6>that has been put out there that is </v>
<v Speaker 6>somehow being mandated.</v>

516
00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.240
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is about he,</v>

517
00:29:36.241 --> 00:29:37.074
<v Speaker 6>she,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

518
00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.750
<v Speaker 6>or if you don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>use a person's name.</v>

519
00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:41.363
<v Speaker 6>Some questions have arisen about this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is this the first time that a law has </v>

520
00:29:44.831 --> 00:29:48.430
<v Speaker 6>decided what we must say as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 6>what we cannot say?</v>

521
00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:51.040
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not at all.</v>

522
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:54.340
<v Speaker 6>Not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not uncommon for the law to require</v>

523
00:29:54.341 --> 00:29:55.174
<v Speaker 6>expression.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bilingual labeling requirements on food </v>

524
00:29:57.731 --> 00:30:00.520
<v Speaker 6>packaging,</v>
<v Speaker 6>health warnings on cigarette packages,</v>

525
00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:04.540
<v Speaker 6>the oath of allegiance to the queen that</v>
<v Speaker 6>must be sworn at citizenship.</v>

526
00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:07.780
<v Speaker 6>Ship ceremonies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not only is forced expression,</v>

527
00:30:07.781 --> 00:30:08.614
<v Speaker 6>not new,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's an entire chapter dedicated to </v>

528
00:30:10.811 --> 00:30:13.750
<v Speaker 6>it in Peter Hogg's constitutional law of</v>
<v Speaker 6>Canada.</v>

529
00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:14.973
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for those of you who don't know Peter </v>

530
00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:17.710
<v Speaker 6>Hog is in law,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we usually deal with,</v>

531
00:30:17.711 --> 00:30:21.400
<v Speaker 6>we refer to him in a hushed voice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He is the leading authoritative,</v>

532
00:30:21.401 --> 00:30:22.234
<v Speaker 6>it is the leading authoritative texts in</v>
<v Speaker 6>Canadian constitutional law by Canada's </v>

533
00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:28.810
<v Speaker 6>preeminent constitutional scholar and </v>
<v Speaker 6>lawyer.</v>

534
00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:31.840
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so is it constitutional?</v>

535
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:32.703
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>are these requirements around pronouns </v>

536
00:30:33.641 --> 00:30:37.060
<v Speaker 6>constitutional?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Does the requirement to not miss gender?</v>

537
00:30:37.061 --> 00:30:37.894
<v Speaker 6>The pronouns violate freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 6>expression under section two B of the </v>

538
00:30:40.451 --> 00:30:43.180
<v Speaker 6>Canadian Charter of rights and freedoms?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Probably a does.</v>

539
00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:44.643
<v Speaker 6>The Supreme Court of Canada says any </v>
<v Speaker 6>restriction on speech is a prime fascia </v>

540
00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:48.993
<v Speaker 6>violation of section two b.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the thing is that's not the end of </v>

541
00:30:51.911 --> 00:30:55.870
<v Speaker 6>the story.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The charter rights are not absolute.</v>

542
00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:56.733
<v Speaker 6>No charter rights are absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's this whole other section in the </v>

543
00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:04.150
<v Speaker 6>charter called section one which says </v>
<v Speaker 6>that all rights and freedoms are subject</v>

544
00:31:04.151 --> 00:31:04.984
<v Speaker 6>to reasonable limits as are demonstrably</v>
<v Speaker 6>justifiable in a free and democratic </v>

545
00:31:08.471 --> 00:31:09.304
<v Speaker 6>society.</v>

546
00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:10.443
<v Speaker 6>The Supreme Court of Canada has </v>
<v Speaker 6>developed a very complex test through </v>

547
00:31:13.811 --> 00:31:16.810
<v Speaker 6>which it balances rights.</v>
<v Speaker 6>On the one hand and reasonable limits on</v>

548
00:31:16.811 --> 00:31:19.960
<v Speaker 6>the other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is what the Supreme Court of Canada</v>

549
00:31:19.961 --> 00:31:20.794
<v Speaker 6>does in charter cases.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the Supreme Court of Canada has on </v>

550
00:31:24.041 --> 00:31:24.874
<v Speaker 6>numerous occasions considered whether </v>
<v Speaker 6>restrictions on speech contained in </v>

551
00:31:28.211 --> 00:31:33.211
<v Speaker 6>human rights codes are constitutional.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It has consistently,</v>

552
00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:35.043
<v Speaker 6>and I have to emphasize consistently </v>
<v Speaker 6>held that although any speech </v>

553
00:31:38.771 --> 00:31:39.604
<v Speaker 6>restrictions that are contained in a </v>
<v Speaker 6>human rights code may violate section </v>

554
00:31:42.371 --> 00:31:43.204
<v Speaker 6>two B of the charter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They are a reasonable limit within the </v>

555
00:31:45.641 --> 00:31:46.474
<v Speaker 6>meaning of section one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They held this in the case of Ross in </v>

556
00:31:49.481 --> 00:31:54.481
<v Speaker 6>the case of Taylor and most recently,</v>
<v Speaker 6>unanimously by the court in 2013.</v>

557
00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:59.950
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have a little thing then about why all</v>

558
00:31:59.951 --> 00:32:04.951
<v Speaker 6>this matters and I'm out of time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But why it all matters is um,</v>

559
00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:06.123
<v Speaker 6>because people matter and I worry that </v>
<v Speaker 6>we've moved into a place now a kind of </v>

560
00:32:10.151 --> 00:32:10.984
<v Speaker 6>not only a post truth politics,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but a kind of post empathy politics </v>

561
00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:17.200
<v Speaker 6>where we no longer seem to care about </v>
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>

562
00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:19.750
<v Speaker 6>And this at the end of the day is about </v>
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>

563
00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:23.050
<v Speaker 6>It's about trans and gender non binary </v>
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>

564
00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:25.480
<v Speaker 6>These are our children,</v>
<v Speaker 6>our siblings,</v>

565
00:32:25.481 --> 00:32:26.890
<v Speaker 6>our nieces,</v>
<v Speaker 6>our nephews.</v>

566
00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.780
<v Speaker 6>These are our friends,</v>
<v Speaker 6>our neighbors,</v>

567
00:32:28.781 --> 00:32:29.614
<v Speaker 6>our colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 6>our lawyers are carpenters and our </v>

568
00:32:31.661 --> 00:32:32.494
<v Speaker 6>teachers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How bloody hard is it to simply treat </v>

569
00:32:36.191 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 6>these people with respect and dignity?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because all this is about</v>

570
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:43.430
<v Speaker 3>all human rights are about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is respect and dignity.</v>

571
00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:46.280
<v Speaker 3>And if he could throw in a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>kindness on the top,</v>

572
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:48.200
<v Speaker 3>that would be even better.</v>

573
00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:54.360
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible]</v>

574
00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:02.940
<v Speaker 3>thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

575
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.210
<v Speaker 3>professor Cossman and now we will go </v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

576
00:33:06.211 --> 00:33:07.044
<v Speaker 3>So what number?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said we're after we do the first </v>

577
00:33:08.911 --> 00:33:09.744
<v Speaker 3>section.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to go back to Professor </v>

578
00:33:11.071 --> 00:33:14.250
<v Speaker 3>Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And on this section we're going to focus</v>

579
00:33:14.251 --> 00:33:15.084
<v Speaker 3>a little bit more on academic freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gender diversity in some of the </v>

580
00:33:18.211 --> 00:33:20.520
<v Speaker 3>implications for scholarship and </v>
<v Speaker 3>teaching.</v>

581
00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:22.380
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so professor Peterson,</v>

582
00:33:22.381 --> 00:33:25.560
<v Speaker 3>I didn't bite you to go first again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 minutes.</v>

583
00:33:25.561 --> 00:33:26.850
<v Speaker 3>We'll have our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our time,</v>

584
00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:29.820
<v Speaker 3>our excellent timekeeper back there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

585
00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:35.223
<v Speaker 4>So I'm gonna read you something that a </v>
<v Speaker 4>graduate student sent me from the </v>

586
00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:40.413
<v Speaker 4>University of Toronto the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I can also tell you that I've </v>

587
00:33:41.621 --> 00:33:45.340
<v Speaker 4>received hundreds of letters like this </v>
<v Speaker 4>today.</v>

588
00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:46.593
<v Speaker 4>I had a tutorial at the University of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Toronto where I talked about Jordan </v>

589
00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:51.910
<v Speaker 4>Peterson and issues of personal </v>
<v Speaker 4>identity,</v>

590
00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:54.730
<v Speaker 4>legally sanctioned identity categories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>et cetera.</v>

591
00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:55.863
<v Speaker 4>I brought up a video of a tall white man</v>
<v Speaker 4>in his thirties who asked students out </v>

592
00:33:59.981 --> 00:34:02.110
<v Speaker 4>of university how they'd react if he </v>
<v Speaker 4>told them.</v>

593
00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:05.020
<v Speaker 4>He identified as a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as black,</v>

594
00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:10.030
<v Speaker 4>as short and as five years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Spoiler alert.</v>

595
00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:14.020
<v Speaker 4>Students in the video resists some of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the later categories a bit better,</v>

596
00:34:14.021 --> 00:34:19.021
<v Speaker 4>mostly accepting still students were not</v>
<v Speaker 4>engaging in discussion.</v>

597
00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:25.140
<v Speaker 4>I asked them why one said it was because</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was worried to share her opinion for</v>

598
00:34:26.171 --> 00:34:29.050
<v Speaker 4>fear of being singled out or saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>something offensive.</v>

599
00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:32.560
<v Speaker 4>I asked who else was not speaking for </v>
<v Speaker 4>that reason.</v>

600
00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:40.020
<v Speaker 4>The whole class put their hands up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was shocking to me.</v>

601
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:42.583
<v Speaker 4>I encouraged them to speak despite their</v>
<v Speaker 4>worries and they gave me some good </v>

602
00:34:46.251 --> 00:34:49.490
<v Speaker 4>feedback on how to make it easier for </v>
<v Speaker 4>them to do so.</v>

603
00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:51.403
<v Speaker 4>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by working in pairs and being assigned </v>

604
00:34:56.061 --> 00:34:56.894
<v Speaker 4>an opinion so that they didn't have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be responsible for it or feel bad for </v>

605
00:35:01.911 --> 00:35:05.270
<v Speaker 4>defending it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No participation.</v>

606
00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:07.183
<v Speaker 4>Why</v>

607
00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:13.650
<v Speaker 4>they weren't on interested.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were afraid to speak their minds.</v>

608
00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:17.160
<v Speaker 4>The PC police are in your heads.</v>

609
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:27.950
<v Speaker 4>He just turned the lawyer's opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have many lawyers opinions.</v>

610
00:35:27.951 --> 00:35:28.784
<v Speaker 4>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll start with lawyer one who was the </v>

611
00:35:31.221 --> 00:35:32.054
<v Speaker 4>counsel to several prime ministers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He talked to me about the human rights </v>

612
00:35:34.131 --> 00:35:36.950
<v Speaker 4>tribunal cause I went and saw him two </v>
<v Speaker 4>weeks after this all started.</v>

613
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:41.250
<v Speaker 4>Human Rights Tribunal is a kangaroo </v>
<v Speaker 4>court in my opinion,</v>

614
00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.470
<v Speaker 4>and it should be abolished as fast as </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>

615
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:46.980
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the many institutions in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Canada that pose a threat to your,</v>

616
00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:50.700
<v Speaker 4>to your freedom that that is almost </v>
<v Speaker 4>unimaginable proportions.</v>

617
00:35:50.701 --> 00:35:51.534
<v Speaker 4>Here's what this top lawyer told me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I'm taking in front of the human </v>

618
00:35:56.491 --> 00:35:57.324
<v Speaker 4>rights tribunal and will cost me </v>
<v Speaker 4>$250,000 I will pay the legal costs for </v>

619
00:36:01.061 --> 00:36:04.860
<v Speaker 4>my opponents and I will lose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

620
00:36:04.861 --> 00:36:08.130
<v Speaker 4>go back to your safe little life and </v>
<v Speaker 4>shut your mouth.</v>

621
00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:10.943
<v Speaker 4>Second lawyer told me my critique of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ontario Human Rights Commission is spot </v>

622
00:36:14.581 --> 00:36:18.090
<v Speaker 4>on and absent the charter of rights and </v>
<v Speaker 4>freedoms,</v>

623
00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:21.480
<v Speaker 4>which has these contradictions built </v>
<v Speaker 4>into it that you just heard described.</v>

624
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:22.613
<v Speaker 4>Much of what I was saying was illegal </v>
<v Speaker 4>and has been illegal since 2012 lawyer </v>

625
00:36:27.601 --> 00:36:30.750
<v Speaker 4>three told me that if I breached a </v>
<v Speaker 4>tribunal order,</v>

626
00:36:30.751 --> 00:36:33.990
<v Speaker 4>so imagine I was taken in front of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>human rights tribunal and I was fine and</v>

627
00:36:33.991 --> 00:36:34.824
<v Speaker 4>then I refused to pay the fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I've stated that I would do that </v>

628
00:36:38.791 --> 00:36:39.624
<v Speaker 4>equals contempt of court,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which inevitably means jail until the </v>

629
00:36:41.911 --> 00:36:45.960
<v Speaker 4>contempt is purged.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He told me the social justice tribunals,</v>

630
00:36:45.961 --> 00:36:46.794
<v Speaker 4>and that's the technical name of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially extra judicial bodies in </v>

631
00:36:49.741 --> 00:36:50.580
<v Speaker 4>Ontario,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

632
00:36:50.581 --> 00:36:51.414
<v Speaker 4>the social justice tribunals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the PC authoritarian types aren't </v>

633
00:36:54.541 --> 00:36:56.550
<v Speaker 4>even trying to hide their terminology </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

634
00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:58.793
<v Speaker 4>The social justice tribunals and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sjws social justice warriors who staff </v>

635
00:37:02.011 --> 00:37:02.844
<v Speaker 4>them have a robe nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can search your house without a </v>

636
00:37:05.011 --> 00:37:07.470
<v Speaker 4>warrant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can use secret hearings.</v>

637
00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:10.560
<v Speaker 4>There are no rules of evidence and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>judges are unaccountable.</v>

638
00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:15.030
<v Speaker 4>Your worst fears of the effect of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>poorly written law will manifest in that</v>

639
00:37:15.031 --> 00:37:19.110
<v Speaker 4>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The sjw say only the worst of the worst.</v>

640
00:37:19.111 --> 00:37:22.500
<v Speaker 4>We'll get punished.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think again with them at the helm.</v>

641
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:26.400
<v Speaker 4>Anything can and does happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but those are legal opinions.</v>

642
00:37:26.401 --> 00:37:27.930
<v Speaker 4>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's look at a real world case.</v>

643
00:37:27.931 --> 00:37:29.940
<v Speaker 4>Let's look at what happened when I made </v>
<v Speaker 4>my videos.</v>

644
00:37:29.941 --> 00:37:30.774
<v Speaker 4>Let's look at how the university </v>
<v Speaker 4>responded because I can tell you in the </v>

645
00:37:33.541 --> 00:37:34.320
<v Speaker 4>video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

646
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.153
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I'm doing is probably illegal and </v>

647
00:37:36.211 --> 00:37:37.044
<v Speaker 4>worse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my employer is legally responsible for </v>

648
00:37:38.821 --> 00:37:41.250
<v Speaker 4>it because that's built in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's built into the codes as well.</v>

649
00:37:41.251 --> 00:37:42.510
<v Speaker 4>So by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're an employer,</v>

650
00:37:42.511 --> 00:37:43.344
<v Speaker 4>you're responsible for everything that </v>
<v Speaker 4>your employees say and everything that </v>

651
00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:50.040
<v Speaker 4>anybody interprets what they said as </v>
<v Speaker 4>being,</v>

652
00:37:50.041 --> 00:37:52.470
<v Speaker 4>whether it's unintentional or </v>
<v Speaker 4>intentional,</v>

653
00:37:52.471 --> 00:37:54.450
<v Speaker 4>whether or not a complaint has been </v>
<v Speaker 4>made.</v>

654
00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.130
<v Speaker 4>So just think about that.</v>

655
00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.890
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>October 3rd the university said like all</v>

656
00:37:58.891 --> 00:37:59.724
<v Speaker 4>members of the university community,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have an obligation to comply with the </v>

657
00:38:01.861 --> 00:38:02.694
<v Speaker 4>law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including the provisions of the Ontario </v>

658
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:05.783
<v Speaker 4>Human Rights Code,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their policy with regards to workplace </v>

659
00:38:07.261 --> 00:38:08.094
<v Speaker 4>harassment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which the university implied that I was </v>

660
00:38:09.301 --> 00:38:10.134
<v Speaker 4>engaging in engaging in a course of </v>
<v Speaker 4>vexatious comment or conduct where the </v>

661
00:38:13.351 --> 00:38:14.184
<v Speaker 4>course of comment or conduct is known or</v>
<v Speaker 4>ought reasonably be known to be </v>

662
00:38:17.611 --> 00:38:20.340
<v Speaker 4>unwelcome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the October 3rd letter,</v>

663
00:38:20.341 --> 00:38:22.950
<v Speaker 4>which was sent to me within one week of </v>
<v Speaker 4>posting my videos.</v>

664
00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.600
<v Speaker 4>And it was the first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what happened?</v>

665
00:38:24.601 --> 00:38:25.434
<v Speaker 4>Essentially it was the university </v>
<v Speaker 4>reviewed what I had done and then they </v>

666
00:38:28.261 --> 00:38:31.680
<v Speaker 4>reviewed the policies as laid out on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ontario Human Rights Commission website.</v>

667
00:38:31.681 --> 00:38:33.780
<v Speaker 4>Where are you guys can all go read them </v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way.</v>

668
00:38:33.781 --> 00:38:35.470
<v Speaker 4>And then you can decide if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

669
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:38.470
<v Speaker 4>if the legal information that you were </v>
<v Speaker 4>just provided with it,</v>

670
00:38:38.471 --> 00:38:40.900
<v Speaker 4>with his in any degree whatsoever </v>
<v Speaker 4>accurate.</v>

671
00:38:40.901 --> 00:38:43.220
<v Speaker 4>Because I would say it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

672
00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:48.630
<v Speaker 4>the university reviewed my videos and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they decided that what I said was true.</v>

673
00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:49.493
<v Speaker 4>They decided that the video I made was </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably illegal and if they were </v>

674
00:38:51.811 --> 00:38:52.644
<v Speaker 4>responsible for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so in an attempt to distance </v>

675
00:38:54.691 --> 00:38:55.524
<v Speaker 4>themselves from me under counsel from </v>
<v Speaker 4>their legal people and believe me the </v>

676
00:38:58.621 --> 00:38:59.454
<v Speaker 4>university has good legal people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they sent me a warning and this is what </v>

677
00:39:02.731 --> 00:39:06.030
<v Speaker 4>happens if you want a discipline and </v>
<v Speaker 4>recalcitrant employee essentially what,</v>

678
00:39:06.031 --> 00:39:09.000
<v Speaker 4>so that you don't have to bear legal </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsibility for their acts.</v>

679
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:10.103
<v Speaker 4>You send them a warning to show that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not in favor of what they're </v>

680
00:39:12.031 --> 00:39:13.560
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then if they continue,</v>

681
00:39:13.561 --> 00:39:14.394
<v Speaker 4>you send them another warning and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>if they continue you send them a third </v>

682
00:39:16.831 --> 00:39:18.630
<v Speaker 4>warning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And after the third warning you can take</v>

683
00:39:18.631 --> 00:39:19.464
<v Speaker 4>further steps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I pointed out to the university at </v>

684
00:39:21.841 --> 00:39:23.910
<v Speaker 4>one point when when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

685
00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:27.750
<v Speaker 4>we were discussing how this forum was </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to proceed,</v>

686
00:39:27.751 --> 00:39:28.584
<v Speaker 4>that perhaps it would be in their best </v>
<v Speaker 4>interests to not support the people who </v>

687
00:39:31.501 --> 00:39:35.970
<v Speaker 4>are trying to stop me from talking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but instead to support me legally and if</v>

688
00:39:35.971 --> 00:39:36.804
<v Speaker 4>necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to take this all the way to the supreme </v>

689
00:39:37.801 --> 00:39:38.634
<v Speaker 4>court.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the university said categorically </v>

690
00:39:39.631 --> 00:39:40.464
<v Speaker 4>that they would not do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I would say when it comes to the </v>

691
00:39:42.391 --> 00:39:45.960
<v Speaker 4>contradictory provisions that are in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Canadian Charter of rights and freedoms,</v>

692
00:39:45.961 --> 00:39:48.840
<v Speaker 4>and so we might say roughly equality </v>
<v Speaker 4>versus freedom of speech,</v>

693
00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:51.540
<v Speaker 4>the university decided which side </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to go down on.</v>

694
00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:53.490
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people tell you all the time,</v>

695
00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:55.340
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

696
00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:57.330
<v Speaker 4>that this has to do with compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

697
00:39:57.331 --> 00:39:58.164
<v Speaker 4>and it's obviously the case that all of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the compassion in this disgust is </v>

698
00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:03.510
<v Speaker 4>discussion is on the side of the people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who are,</v>

699
00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:04.590
<v Speaker 4>who are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

700
00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:08.490
<v Speaker 4>any encouraging their listeners to play </v>
<v Speaker 4>victim and perpetrator.</v>

701
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:09.463
<v Speaker 4>And I can tell you as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychoanalytically oriented </v>

702
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:12.263
<v Speaker 4>psychologists that there's nothing more </v>
<v Speaker 4>horrible for children and developing </v>

703
00:40:15.541 --> 00:40:18.150
<v Speaker 4>people than an excessive compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

704
00:40:18.151 --> 00:40:20.760
<v Speaker 4>That's the standard Friday and devouring</v>
<v Speaker 4>mother.</v>

705
00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:23.040
<v Speaker 4>And if you want a little archetype,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

706
00:40:23.041 --> 00:40:25.320
<v Speaker 4>to go along with that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I suppose most of you have seen,</v>

707
00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:27.630
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the little mermaid.</v>

708
00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:32.490
<v Speaker 4>You Remember Ursula?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ursula wants to put King Poseidon's soul</v>

709
00:40:32.491 --> 00:40:33.324
<v Speaker 4>in a little jar in her collection and </v>
<v Speaker 4>she wants to take away Ariel's voice so </v>

710
00:40:36.031 --> 00:40:39.120
<v Speaker 4>she can't establish herself as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>conscious being in the world.</v>

711
00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:40.313
<v Speaker 4>And I would suggest very strongly that </v>
<v Speaker 4>all these people that continually talk </v>

712
00:40:43.171 --> 00:40:48.171
<v Speaker 4>to you about compassion do not in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>least have your best interests in mind.</v>

713
00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:49.583
<v Speaker 4>And there are far more virtues and </v>
<v Speaker 4>values than an excessive pity for </v>

714
00:40:52.951 --> 00:40:53.850
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

715
00:40:53.851 --> 00:40:55.560
<v Speaker 4>you don't want a pitty your children </v>
<v Speaker 4>even.</v>

716
00:40:55.561 --> 00:40:56.394
<v Speaker 4>You want to encourage them to develop </v>
<v Speaker 4>and strong and in a strong and </v>

717
00:40:59.161 --> 00:41:01.950
<v Speaker 4>forthright manner so that they can go </v>
<v Speaker 4>out and take on the world.</v>

718
00:41:01.951 --> 00:41:02.784
<v Speaker 4>And an excess of compassion just to </v>
<v Speaker 4>ensures that when they're 40 they're </v>

719
00:41:05.941 --> 00:41:06.774
<v Speaker 4>going to be living in your basement </v>
<v Speaker 4>plotting evil routines about the world </v>

720
00:41:09.901 --> 00:41:13.650
<v Speaker 4>because their ability to manifest </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves as successful beings has been</v>

721
00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:14.813
<v Speaker 4>absolutely compromised.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that we're seeing this </v>

722
00:41:16.951 --> 00:41:18.180
<v Speaker 4>played out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're busy,</v>

723
00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:20.580
<v Speaker 4>we're seeing this played out in society </v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

724
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:21.583
<v Speaker 4>and I think it's absolutely horrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So on October 18th the university </v>

725
00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:26.303
<v Speaker 4>mentioned to me in another warning </v>
<v Speaker 4>letter that if personal pronouns are </v>

726
00:41:30.001 --> 00:41:30.834
<v Speaker 4>being used,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the refusal to use the personal pronoun </v>

727
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:34.003
<v Speaker 4>that is an expression of the person's </v>
<v Speaker 4>gender identity can constitute </v>

728
00:41:36.231 --> 00:41:37.070
<v Speaker 4>discrimination.</v>

729
00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.233
<v Speaker 4>So now you see what's happened is that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>haven't refused to use someone's </v>

730
00:41:41.571 --> 00:41:45.590
<v Speaker 4>gendered gender neutral pronouns I said </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I would refuse.</v>

731
00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:49.100
<v Speaker 4>So it's not even the refusal itself </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's producing the letters.</v>

732
00:41:49.101 --> 00:41:52.580
<v Speaker 4>It's my declared intent to engage in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>refusal.</v>

733
00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:53.593
<v Speaker 4>And as far as I was concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I was essentially doing was </v>

734
00:41:55.191 --> 00:41:58.130
<v Speaker 4>criticizing a piece of legislation that </v>
<v Speaker 4>had not yet been passed,</v>

735
00:41:58.370 --> 00:42:02.480
<v Speaker 4>but the university's legal department </v>
<v Speaker 4>decided that all that was sufficient for</v>

736
00:42:02.481 --> 00:42:06.890
<v Speaker 4>them to distance themselves from me and </v>
<v Speaker 4>to engage in disciplinary activity.</v>

737
00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:07.993
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then with regards to these human </v>

738
00:42:09.531 --> 00:42:11.960
<v Speaker 4>rights tribunals where all of this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 4>would be sorted out,</v>

739
00:42:11.961 --> 00:42:12.794
<v Speaker 4>it's like those places destroy your </v>
<v Speaker 4>reputation and destroy you financially </v>

740
00:42:15.921 --> 00:42:17.780
<v Speaker 4>and can they put you in jail?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

741
00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.850
<v Speaker 4>it's a complicated argument in some </v>
<v Speaker 4>sense,</v>

742
00:42:19.851 --> 00:42:22.130
<v Speaker 4>but I can tell you that if you refuse to</v>
<v Speaker 4>pay the fine.</v>

743
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:22.963
<v Speaker 4>So that's the next step.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think you're being sold a bill of </v>

744
00:42:25.701 --> 00:42:29.460
<v Speaker 4>goods here about how benevolent the </v>
<v Speaker 4>intent of bill see 16 is.</v>

745
00:42:29.461 --> 00:42:33.170
<v Speaker 4>And I also know because another lawyer </v>
<v Speaker 4>told me that the,</v>

746
00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.930
<v Speaker 4>because I suspected that the Ontario </v>
<v Speaker 4>Human Rights Commission,</v>

747
00:42:35.931 --> 00:42:36.764
<v Speaker 4>people were behind all of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>legislation essentially speaking in </v>

748
00:42:38.841 --> 00:42:39.674
<v Speaker 4>Canada and that that's actually the case</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the federal people have </v>

749
00:42:42.891 --> 00:42:45.350
<v Speaker 4>indicated that these policies will be </v>
<v Speaker 4>interpreted,</v>

750
00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:46.423
<v Speaker 4>interpreted in accordance with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ontario Human Rights Commission's </v>

751
00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:49.243
<v Speaker 4>policies online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you guys should go read those </v>

752
00:42:51.291 --> 00:42:52.124
<v Speaker 4>because those are not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I would say that they pose an </v>

753
00:42:54.081 --> 00:42:54.914
<v Speaker 4>incredible threat to your liberty and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all done under the guise of </v>

754
00:42:57.351 --> 00:42:58.184
<v Speaker 4>compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like I don't consider myself a </v>

755
00:42:59.931 --> 00:43:03.440
<v Speaker 4>particularly compassionate person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>

756
00:43:03.441 --> 00:43:06.590
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm more compassionate that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be for my own wellbeing.</v>

757
00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:08.900
<v Speaker 4>But I can tell you that that is not the </v>
<v Speaker 4>only virtue.</v>

758
00:43:08.901 --> 00:43:09.734
<v Speaker 4>And people who keep pushing that on you </v>
<v Speaker 4>are making a massive mistake and their </v>

759
00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:13.843
<v Speaker 4>infant tantalizing you and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrifying people in the university </v>

760
00:43:16.701 --> 00:43:19.700
<v Speaker 4>community as you can tell by the letter </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I just read it and I've really,</v>

761
00:43:19.701 --> 00:43:20.534
<v Speaker 4>I received dozens of letters like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are afraid to say anything </v>

762
00:43:22.881 --> 00:43:25.460
<v Speaker 4>because they're going to get targeted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you wonder or not,</v>

763
00:43:25.461 --> 00:43:26.294
<v Speaker 4>if that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then just think about what happened to </v>

764
00:43:27.471 --> 00:43:29.840
<v Speaker 4>me and ask yourself if it's true.</v>

765
00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:33.360
<v Speaker 4>Good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

766
00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:38.410
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible].</v>

767
00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:49.620
<v Speaker 3>So professor Bryson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can we have you speak next and uh,</v>

768
00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:52.220
<v Speaker 3>may I just say thank you for coming out </v>
<v Speaker 3>from Vancouver,</v>

769
00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:53.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to join us.</v>

770
00:43:53.211 --> 00:43:56.540
<v Speaker 3>Every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone else here is from University of</v>

771
00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:57.373
<v Speaker 3>Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but professor Bryson came out from </v>

772
00:43:58.251 --> 00:43:59.390
<v Speaker 3>Vancouver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so thank you.</v>

773
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:02.280
<v Speaker 7>Thank you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>provost Moran.</v>

774
00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:07.680
<v Speaker 7>What a wild ride we're on this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're all doing okay so far.</v>

775
00:44:07.681 --> 00:44:12.600
<v Speaker 7>I think as a Trinity College and Oil z </v>
<v Speaker 7>alumnus,</v>

776
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:16.560
<v Speaker 7>I'm typically delighted to return to the</v>
<v Speaker 7>University of Toronto.</v>

777
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:21.840
<v Speaker 7>Today is different to make sense of what</v>
<v Speaker 7>it means to be here today.</v>

778
00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:22.943
<v Speaker 7>I've found myself going back frequently </v>
<v Speaker 7>to the 1989 debate at western on the </v>

779
00:44:28.091 --> 00:44:31.110
<v Speaker 7>subject of race and Iq between Phillip </v>
<v Speaker 7>Rushton,</v>

780
00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:32.123
<v Speaker 7>David Suzuki,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the stakes then and now we're very </v>

781
00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:40.020
<v Speaker 7>familiar to borrow David Suzuki to </v>
<v Speaker 7>opening words on that day.</v>

782
00:44:40.021 --> 00:44:42.780
<v Speaker 7>Quote,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I do not want to be here.</v>

783
00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:43.973
<v Speaker 7>I do not want to dignify this man and </v>
<v Speaker 7>his ideas in public debate and quote </v>

784
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:50.603
<v Speaker 7>yesterday Bill See 16 passed third </v>
<v Speaker 7>reading in the House of Commons and </v>

785
00:44:55.231 --> 00:45:00.231
<v Speaker 7>tomorrow is a trans day of remembrance.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you only hear this,</v>

786
00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:01.943
<v Speaker 7>know that I am unwavering in my belief </v>
<v Speaker 7>that the fundamental rights to safety </v>

787
00:45:06.901 --> 00:45:11.850
<v Speaker 7>and the humanity of trans and non binary</v>
<v Speaker 7>people are not up for debate.</v>

788
00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:14.243
<v Speaker 7>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there was in 1989 at Western as now an </v>

789
00:45:22.561 --> 00:45:23.394
<v Speaker 7>extraordinary media frenzy concerning </v>
<v Speaker 7>the apparent threat to academic freedom </v>

790
00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:29.003
<v Speaker 7>posed by the mere possibility that </v>
<v Speaker 7>academic freedom is not an absolute </v>

791
00:45:33.811 --> 00:45:38.160
<v Speaker 7>guarantee that has scholars our </v>
<v Speaker 7>relationship with knowledge and with the</v>

792
00:45:38.161 --> 00:45:38.994
<v Speaker 7>public trust is tempered by </v>
<v Speaker 7>responsibilities and limitations of </v>

793
00:45:43.981 --> 00:45:44.814
<v Speaker 7>crucial.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Important to my argument today is that </v>

794
00:45:47.101 --> 00:45:51.300
<v Speaker 7>this is a relationship structured not on</v>
<v Speaker 7>juridical grounds.</v>

795
00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:55.320
<v Speaker 7>This is not about the law but on ethical</v>
<v Speaker 7>grounds.</v>

796
00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:56.543
<v Speaker 7>The very real effects of the knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 7>claims that we make as scholars require </v>

797
00:46:00.421 --> 00:46:04.140
<v Speaker 7>that our claims be subjected to rigorous</v>
<v Speaker 7>critical scrutiny.</v>

798
00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:05.363
<v Speaker 7>And there is no set of knowledge claims.</v>
<v Speaker 7>More important to subject to critical </v>

799
00:46:09.721 --> 00:46:10.554
<v Speaker 7>scrutiny than statements that appear to </v>
<v Speaker 7>perpetuate and to insight already </v>

800
00:46:15.661 --> 00:46:18.690
<v Speaker 7>existing forms of hatred,</v>
<v Speaker 7>violence,</v>

801
00:46:18.691 --> 00:46:21.390
<v Speaker 7>and prejudice toward members of minority</v>
<v Speaker 7>groups.</v>

802
00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:22.763
<v Speaker 7>We need to identify and address the </v>
<v Speaker 7>claims made in the recent public works </v>

803
00:46:27.181 --> 00:46:28.014
<v Speaker 7>of Jordan Peterson claims about trans </v>
<v Speaker 7>people claims about the validity of </v>

804
00:46:32.431 --> 00:46:33.264
<v Speaker 7>gender identity claims about the proper </v>
<v Speaker 7>use of pronouns and claims about </v>

805
00:46:37.801 --> 00:46:39.360
<v Speaker 7>academic freedom rights.</v>

806
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:40.463
<v Speaker 7>And let's be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we have a unique difficulty here today </v>

807
00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:47.130
<v Speaker 7>in subjecting these claims to scholarly </v>
<v Speaker 7>scrutiny.</v>

808
00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:51.270
<v Speaker 7>What kind of claims can you have?</v>
<v Speaker 7>An amateurish videos,</v>

809
00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:54.900
<v Speaker 7>although this man is making these </v>
<v Speaker 7>claims,</v>

810
00:46:54.901 --> 00:46:55.734
<v Speaker 7>has Dr. Jordan Peterson as a professor </v>
<v Speaker 7>and a clinical psychologist employed at </v>

811
00:47:00.571 --> 00:47:01.404
<v Speaker 7>a great Canadian University.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The claims are not being made in </v>

812
00:47:05.641 --> 00:47:10.260
<v Speaker 7>relation to any publicly accessible body</v>
<v Speaker 7>of peer reviewed scholarship.</v>

813
00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:12.870
<v Speaker 7>So why this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>why now?</v>

814
00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:14.393
<v Speaker 7>The recent public works of Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 7>Peterson provide a fabulous case study </v>

815
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:21.270
<v Speaker 7>of the cultural production of true </v>
<v Speaker 7>believers,</v>

816
00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:27.120
<v Speaker 7>the cultural production of ignorance in </v>
<v Speaker 7>an age of reactionary populism,</v>

817
00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:31.600
<v Speaker 7>the cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a historian of cancer,</v>

818
00:47:31.601 --> 00:47:32.434
<v Speaker 7>Robert proctor coined the term ag </v>
<v Speaker 7>natology to describe systematic </v>

819
00:47:36.701 --> 00:47:41.380
<v Speaker 7>attention to the production of ignorance</v>
<v Speaker 7>and let's not beat around the bush.</v>

820
00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:42.543
<v Speaker 7>Bad Science is deadly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whether in the area of cancer or gender </v>

821
00:47:45.971 --> 00:47:46.804
<v Speaker 7>and population health.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The cultural production of ignorance </v>

822
00:47:50.261 --> 00:47:51.094
<v Speaker 7>does not point to a vacuum,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but rather represents a deliberate </v>

823
00:47:54.971 --> 00:47:58.660
<v Speaker 7>relationship to knowledge that is </v>
<v Speaker 7>consequential in our lives.</v>

824
00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:03.040
<v Speaker 7>For proctor,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the tactics used by the tobacco industry</v>

825
00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.113
<v Speaker 7>provide a perfect example of how doubt </v>
<v Speaker 7>and controversy are enlisted to produce </v>

826
00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:09.513
<v Speaker 7>ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So let's take a look at how </v>

827
00:48:12.191 --> 00:48:16.420
<v Speaker 7>consequential and studied ignorance </v>
<v Speaker 7>works in relation to gender.</v>

828
00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:22.050
<v Speaker 7>Here are the major claims of Dr </v>
<v Speaker 7>Peterson's recent public works.</v>

829
00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:23.283
<v Speaker 7>Specifically the first of three lectures</v>
<v Speaker 7>concerning bill see 16 and I will quote </v>

830
00:48:28.871 --> 00:48:33.871
<v Speaker 7>directly here from my lecture transcript</v>
<v Speaker 7>bill.</v>

831
00:48:34.061 --> 00:48:38.140
<v Speaker 7>See 16 scares me lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dr. Peterson,</v>

832
00:48:38.590 --> 00:48:43.590
<v Speaker 7>the Ontario Human Rights Commission is a</v>
<v Speaker 7>particularly pathological organization.</v>

833
00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:45.213
<v Speaker 7>Social Justice Warrior types are </v>
<v Speaker 7>overrepresented and I can't help but </v>

834
00:48:49.451 --> 00:48:50.284
<v Speaker 7>think it's because our current premier </v>
<v Speaker 7>is a lesbian and the lgbt community has </v>

835
00:48:57.071 --> 00:48:57.904
<v Speaker 7>become extraordinarily good at </v>
<v Speaker 7>organizing themselves and has a fairly </v>

836
00:49:02.321 --> 00:49:07.150
<v Speaker 7>pronounced and very,</v>
<v Speaker 7>very sophisticated radical fringe.</v>

837
00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:11.440
<v Speaker 7>I'll carry on,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I quote,</v>

838
00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:15.250
<v Speaker 7>gender identity and gender expression </v>
<v Speaker 7>are not valid ideas.</v>

839
00:49:15.251 --> 00:49:17.500
<v Speaker 7>They're not true.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's no evidence for it.</v>

840
00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:22.000
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what the options are if you</v>
<v Speaker 7>don't identify as a man or a woman.</v>

841
00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:26.080
<v Speaker 7>There's an idea that there's a gender </v>
<v Speaker 7>spectrum.</v>

842
00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:26.943
<v Speaker 7>I think it's an ill informed opinion and</v>
<v Speaker 7>quote rather than to address himself to </v>

843
00:49:32.111 --> 00:49:32.944
<v Speaker 7>this scientific evidence concerning </v>
<v Speaker 7>gender identity and expression and by </v>

844
00:49:36.911 --> 00:49:37.744
<v Speaker 7>adopting rhetorical strategies more </v>
<v Speaker 7>common to Breitbart news.com than a </v>

845
00:49:42.491 --> 00:49:43.324
<v Speaker 7>university professors lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dr. Peterson goes on to discredit the </v>

846
00:49:47.441 --> 00:49:48.274
<v Speaker 7>very constructs on political grounds </v>
<v Speaker 7>instead of on grounds provided by </v>

847
00:49:52.541 --> 00:49:53.374
<v Speaker 7>scholarly evidence that these constructs</v>
<v Speaker 7>are in no particular order leftist </v>

848
00:49:58.450 --> 00:49:59.283
<v Speaker 7>radical and politically correct on the </v>
<v Speaker 7>subject of pronouns and gender </v>

849
00:50:04.091 --> 00:50:07.060
<v Speaker 7>expression.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dr. Peterson is in phatic.</v>

850
00:50:07.061 --> 00:50:10.450
<v Speaker 7>That quote,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't recognize another person's right</v>

851
00:50:10.451 --> 00:50:13.270
<v Speaker 7>to determine what pronouns I use to </v>
<v Speaker 7>address them.</v>

852
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:17.170
<v Speaker 7>I won't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>For the vast majority of people.</v>

853
00:50:17.171 --> 00:50:18.004
<v Speaker 7>He goes on to say gender identity and </v>
<v Speaker 7>sexual orientation and I guess he means </v>

854
00:50:22.031 --> 00:50:24.820
<v Speaker 7>sex are the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And quote,</v>

855
00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:29.870
<v Speaker 7>as for the definition of transgender,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dr. Peterson claims that,</v>

856
00:50:29.871 --> 00:50:33.290
<v Speaker 7>and I quote,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't believe that they,</v>

857
00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:36.830
<v Speaker 7>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>these terms stand for good things.</v>

858
00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:37.963
<v Speaker 7>I think that these people use these </v>
<v Speaker 7>terms as a pretense that they stand for </v>

859
00:50:43.161 --> 00:50:43.994
<v Speaker 7>good things as a pretext for them to </v>
<v Speaker 7>continue their nefarious activities and </v>

860
00:50:49.041 --> 00:50:51.080
<v Speaker 7>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

861
00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:55.220
<v Speaker 7>this is hardly the stuff of academic </v>
<v Speaker 7>scholarship.</v>

862
00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:56.563
<v Speaker 7>I'm a member of the global education </v>
<v Speaker 7>initiative of the World Professional </v>

863
00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:01.963
<v Speaker 7>Association for transgender health and I</v>
<v Speaker 7>can tell you without a shred of doubt </v>

864
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:10.510
<v Speaker 7>that there is no link between the public</v>
<v Speaker 7>claims made by professor Jordan Peterson</v>

865
00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:16.040
<v Speaker 7>about gender generally and transgender </v>
<v Speaker 7>specifically,</v>

866
00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:20.450
<v Speaker 7>and a body of easily accessible peer </v>
<v Speaker 7>reviewed scholarship.</v>

867
00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:21.763
<v Speaker 7>This body of peer reviewed research </v>
<v Speaker 7>knowledge provides conclusive evidence </v>

868
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:26.863
<v Speaker 7>that whereas anatomical sex is perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 7>dimorphic Lee categorical and that's </v>

869
00:51:30.621 --> 00:51:31.454
<v Speaker 7>only if we choose to ignore intersects,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that secondary sex characteristics </v>

870
00:51:35.601 --> 00:51:36.434
<v Speaker 7>cannot be argued simplistically to be </v>
<v Speaker 7>determined by Chromosomal sex and that </v>

871
00:51:40.491 --> 00:51:41.324
<v Speaker 7>there is highly significant diversity in</v>
<v Speaker 7>gender identity and expression which </v>

872
00:51:45.681 --> 00:51:46.514
<v Speaker 7>exists on a continuum that reveals </v>
<v Speaker 7>persistent differences that cannot be </v>

873
00:51:50.331 --> 00:51:52.640
<v Speaker 7>explained by sex assigned at birth.</v>

874
00:51:53.330 --> 00:51:54.163
<v Speaker 7>Gender identity and expression are </v>
<v Speaker 7>dynamic bio social aspects of human </v>

875
00:51:58.491 --> 00:51:59.324
<v Speaker 7>diversity that are culturally and </v>
<v Speaker 7>socially in a complex relationship with </v>

876
00:52:03.201 --> 00:52:04.034
<v Speaker 7>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Gender identity and expression are </v>

877
00:52:06.501 --> 00:52:07.334
<v Speaker 7>linked both to the extraordinary </v>
<v Speaker 7>plasticity of human life and the </v>

878
00:52:11.001 --> 00:52:11.834
<v Speaker 7>fluidity of identity and as well.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And this is where we must pay close </v>

879
00:52:15.711 --> 00:52:16.544
<v Speaker 7>attention linked to gender based </v>
<v Speaker 7>violence to minority stress and threats </v>

880
00:52:22.551 --> 00:52:27.410
<v Speaker 7>to a whole host of rights in Canada that</v>
<v Speaker 7>are not up for debate here today.</v>

881
00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:30.440
<v Speaker 7>These rights include the right to </v>
<v Speaker 7>recognition,</v>

882
00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:32.930
<v Speaker 7>the right to communicability of </v>
<v Speaker 7>presence,</v>

883
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:36.680
<v Speaker 7>the right to culturally competent </v>
<v Speaker 7>institutional climates,</v>

884
00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:39.680
<v Speaker 7>and perhaps the most profound of all </v>
<v Speaker 7>rights,</v>

885
00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:44.210
<v Speaker 7>the right to safety and the right to </v>
<v Speaker 7>culture and access to knowledge.</v>

886
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:45.463
<v Speaker 7>Whereas almost all the media attention </v>
<v Speaker 7>on the Jordan Peterson affair has </v>

887
00:52:49.371 --> 00:52:52.460
<v Speaker 7>focused on the possible threat to his </v>
<v Speaker 7>academic freedom.</v>

888
00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:53.773
<v Speaker 7>I want to focus instead on the ethical </v>
<v Speaker 7>significance of an academic's total </v>

889
00:52:59.271 --> 00:53:01.910
<v Speaker 7>dereliction of academic responsibility.</v>

890
00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:03.073
<v Speaker 7>Academics are never free to distribute </v>
<v Speaker 7>totally bogus claims while trading on </v>

891
00:53:08.001 --> 00:53:08.834
<v Speaker 7>the value provided by their title as a </v>
<v Speaker 7>professor in a great Canadian </v>

892
00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:13.753
<v Speaker 7>University,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and perhaps even worse as a clinician </v>

893
00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:20.330
<v Speaker 7>registered by an accreditation body,</v>
<v Speaker 7>quite the contrary,</v>

894
00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:21.763
<v Speaker 7>every faculty member takes on academic </v>
<v Speaker 7>responsibilities that embody an ethical </v>

895
00:53:26.671 --> 00:53:27.504
<v Speaker 7>commitment,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is precisely not responsibilities </v>

896
00:53:30.091 --> 00:53:30.924
<v Speaker 7>required by the law.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Academic knowledge that appears to </v>

897
00:53:34.351 --> 00:53:35.184
<v Speaker 7>codify knowledge about minority </v>
<v Speaker 7>populations must not add to the harms </v>

898
00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:40.883
<v Speaker 7>already facing minority groups by itself</v>
<v Speaker 7>contributing to the consolidation of </v>

899
00:53:45.301 --> 00:53:48.990
<v Speaker 7>ignorance,</v>
<v Speaker 7>nor by inciting hatred toward members of</v>

900
00:53:48.991 --> 00:53:52.830
<v Speaker 7>these groups.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Faced with Phillip Russians perpetuation</v>

901
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:58.190
<v Speaker 7>of racist assumptions in his research on</v>
<v Speaker 7>race and Iq in the 1989 debate,</v>

902
00:53:58.830 --> 00:54:03.150
<v Speaker 7>David Suzuki concludes that one can only</v>
<v Speaker 7>infer quote.</v>

903
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:08.580
<v Speaker 7>He is either grossly ignorant or </v>
<v Speaker 7>deliberately mischievous.</v>

904
00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:12.990
<v Speaker 7>Either way,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what is required is action by scientists</v>

905
00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:16.980
<v Speaker 7>and academics.</v>
<v Speaker 7>His claims must be denounced.</v>

906
00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:17.963
<v Speaker 7>This is not science and quote.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Surely the deliberate production of </v>

907
00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:23.993
<v Speaker 7>ignorance concerning a precarious </v>
<v Speaker 7>minority group constitutes evidence of </v>

908
00:54:28.591 --> 00:54:29.424
<v Speaker 7>the most unethical abnegation of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>responsibility of academics to </v>

909
00:54:33.841 --> 00:54:38.400
<v Speaker 7>contribute to human wellbeing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>collective intelligence flourishing,</v>

910
00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:43.430
<v Speaker 7>and the survival of planetary life.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The institution of the Public University</v>

911
00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:44.753
<v Speaker 7>cannot and must not sanction ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And most emphatically we must denounce </v>

912
00:54:50.071 --> 00:54:53.010
<v Speaker 7>the deliberate cultural production of </v>
<v Speaker 7>ignorance.</v>

913
00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:57.840
<v Speaker 7>We can and we must do better and we must</v>
<v Speaker 7>do better.</v>

914
00:54:58.020 --> 00:54:58.853
<v Speaker 7>Not because it is prescribed by the law,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but because we have an ethical </v>

915
00:55:02.671 --> 00:55:06.840
<v Speaker 7>commitment to contribute to the </v>
<v Speaker 7>advancement of knowledge in a democratic</v>

916
00:55:06.841 --> 00:55:08.670
<v Speaker 7>society.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Thank you.</v>

917
00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:14.320
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

918
00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:20.940
<v Speaker 3>thank you all very much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

919
00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:25.360
<v Speaker 3>and so now I'm going to just ask a few </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions of clarification.</v>

920
00:55:25.361 --> 00:55:29.140
<v Speaker 3>We'll go more or less in the order that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the speakers went.</v>

921
00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:33.370
<v Speaker 3>And then as I indicated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are questions from the audience.</v>

922
00:55:33.371 --> 00:55:37.090
<v Speaker 3>You can email them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The address is there.</v>

923
00:55:37.330 --> 00:55:39.460
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there are people in the room.</v>

924
00:55:39.490 --> 00:55:40.990
<v Speaker 3>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are a few people.</v>

925
00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:46.140
<v Speaker 3>So put up your hands if you don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>capacity to email and they'll get around</v>

926
00:55:46.181 --> 00:55:48.100
<v Speaker 3>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We won't be able to ask,</v>

927
00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:50.320
<v Speaker 3>answer all the questions some or post </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

928
00:55:50.321 --> 00:55:52.060
<v Speaker 3>but we'll do our best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

929
00:55:52.061 --> 00:55:52.894
<v Speaker 3>so professor Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll start with you since you were the </v>

930
00:55:54.641 --> 00:55:56.310
<v Speaker 3>first speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

931
00:55:56.410 --> 00:55:57.243
<v Speaker 3>of course there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are a few lawyers on the stage </v>

932
00:55:58.661 --> 00:55:59.494
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Law seems to figure very prominently in </v>

933
00:56:02.261 --> 00:56:04.870
<v Speaker 3>your argument and in many of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>concerns.</v>

934
00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:06.033
<v Speaker 3>And Professor Cossman is obviously set </v>
<v Speaker 3>out a number of the issues in terms of </v>

935
00:56:10.211 --> 00:56:12.100
<v Speaker 3>what the laws to actually say.</v>

936
00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:13.233
<v Speaker 3>You cited in response a number of legal </v>
<v Speaker 3>experts and one of the things about </v>

937
00:56:17.171 --> 00:56:20.260
<v Speaker 3>legal experts as there are a lot of them</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they often don't agree.</v>

938
00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:21.820
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

939
00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:26.800
<v Speaker 3>in law we tend to between the law as it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is and the laws we would like it to be.</v>

940
00:56:26.801 --> 00:56:31.780
<v Speaker 3>And the experts you cited seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>critical of the law as it is,</v>

941
00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:33.430
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>along with you.</v>

942
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:34.503
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but does professors costs minutes </v>

943
00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:41.050
<v Speaker 3>outlining of some of the elements of see</v>
<v Speaker 3>16 in particular,</v>

944
00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:42.003
<v Speaker 3>does that give you any comfort?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that allay any of your concerns </v>

945
00:56:44.711 --> 00:56:45.544
<v Speaker 3>that it really focuses on the advocacy </v>
<v Speaker 3>of genocide or the commission of hate </v>

946
00:56:49.331 --> 00:56:50.164
<v Speaker 3>crimes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that those kinds of things are </v>

947
00:56:51.971 --> 00:56:56.170
<v Speaker 3>probably the sort of restrictions that </v>
<v Speaker 3>most people in the room would think were</v>

948
00:56:56.171 --> 00:56:58.330
<v Speaker 3>reasonable restrictions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

949
00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:00.590
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you just give me any comfort.</v>

950
00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:01.533
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the reason it doesn't give me any </v>

951
00:57:02.571 --> 00:57:04.880
<v Speaker 4>comfort is because as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>concerned,</v>

952
00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:09.050
<v Speaker 4>what this is actually about has already </v>
<v Speaker 4>played itself out in my case.</v>

953
00:57:09.051 --> 00:57:11.360
<v Speaker 4>And I already explained,</v>
<v Speaker 4>explained that to you.</v>

954
00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:12.523
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to tell you some of the </v>

955
00:57:13.851 --> 00:57:17.900
<v Speaker 4>pernicious things about the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about the legislation and this is,</v>

956
00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:20.150
<v Speaker 4>and she means see 16,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that what you are actually,</v>

957
00:57:20.151 --> 00:57:23.890
<v Speaker 4>I mean the policy guidelines that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>will be interpreted with him because the</v>

958
00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:27.410
<v Speaker 4>legislation itself is only a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 4>paragraphs in it and it looks innocuous.</v>

959
00:57:27.411 --> 00:57:30.080
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say a,</v>

960
00:57:30.090 --> 00:57:35.090
<v Speaker 4>a legal doctrine is something like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>virus and it has a life if you output,</v>

961
00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:35.953
<v Speaker 4>we think if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you let it go into a living system </v>

962
00:57:38.871 --> 00:57:42.500
<v Speaker 4>that it propagates and it has effects </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the effects are a consequence of the</v>

963
00:57:42.501 --> 00:57:44.360
<v Speaker 4>philosophy that's embedded inside the </v>
<v Speaker 4>law.</v>

964
00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:46.130
<v Speaker 4>And if you really want to know about </v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

965
00:57:46.131 --> 00:57:48.770
<v Speaker 4>you should read Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn </v>
<v Speaker 4>school like archipelago.</v>

966
00:57:48.771 --> 00:57:49.604
<v Speaker 4>Because what he does in that book is </v>
<v Speaker 4>tell you how the hypothetically humane </v>

967
00:57:52.491 --> 00:57:53.324
<v Speaker 4>doctrines that were embedded in radical </v>
<v Speaker 4>Marxism at the end of the 18 hundreds </v>

968
00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:57.013
<v Speaker 4>unfolded into Soviet society and </v>
<v Speaker 4>demolished it along with many other </v>

969
00:57:59.661 --> 00:58:00.560
<v Speaker 4>societies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might,</v>

970
00:58:00.590 --> 00:58:01.423
<v Speaker 4>I might point out 10.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He won the Nobel prize for that for no </v>

971
00:58:03.441 --> 00:58:04.274
<v Speaker 4>small reason and was regarded as one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the people who brought down the Soviet </v>

972
00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:08.360
<v Speaker 4>Union.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's a masterpiece.</v>

973
00:58:08.361 --> 00:58:09.980
<v Speaker 4>That book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is a complex issue,</v>

974
00:58:09.981 --> 00:58:12.470
<v Speaker 4>and to understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to do that sort of reading.</v>

975
00:58:12.830 --> 00:58:15.260
<v Speaker 4>But I want to tell you a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>about what the law does.</v>

976
00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:16.273
<v Speaker 4>And this is with regards to its </v>
<v Speaker 4>interpretation from the policy </v>

977
00:58:18.561 --> 00:58:19.394
<v Speaker 4>guidelines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It instantiates social constructionism </v>

978
00:58:21.891 --> 00:58:25.730
<v Speaker 4>into our legal system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to understand what that means.</v>

979
00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:28.880
<v Speaker 4>There's a huge debate about how human </v>
<v Speaker 4>identity is,</v>

980
00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:29.960
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

981
00:58:29.961 --> 00:58:30.794
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

982
00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:33.290
<v Speaker 4>upon what grounds human identity is </v>
<v Speaker 4>predicated.</v>

983
00:58:33.530 --> 00:58:34.363
<v Speaker 4>Now the radical social constructionists </v>
<v Speaker 4>basically say that identity is nothing </v>

984
00:58:37.701 --> 00:58:38.534
<v Speaker 4>but a social construction and not that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>in keeping with their philosophical </v>

985
00:58:41.121 --> 00:58:43.010
<v Speaker 4>doctrines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Partly Marxist and Parsley,</v>

986
00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:45.230
<v Speaker 4>partly postmodern,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that isn't,</v>

987
00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:48.830
<v Speaker 4>and that was what I was objecting to </v>
<v Speaker 4>with regards to bill [inaudible] because</v>

988
00:58:48.831 --> 00:58:50.990
<v Speaker 4>it insists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you understand this?</v>

989
00:58:51.110 --> 00:58:55.460
<v Speaker 4>It makes this legal doctrine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that biological sex,</v>

990
00:58:55.790 --> 00:59:00.080
<v Speaker 4>gender identity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gender expression and sexual orientation</v>

991
00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:05.170
<v Speaker 4>very independently and they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the reason they don't is because 98%</v>

992
00:59:08.481 --> 00:59:11.150
<v Speaker 4>of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's 99.7% of people,</v>

993
00:59:11.151 --> 00:59:11.984
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least with regards to the most </v>

994
00:59:12.771 --> 00:59:15.110
<v Speaker 4>credible statistics have a gender </v>
<v Speaker 4>identity.</v>

995
00:59:15.111 --> 00:59:15.944
<v Speaker 4>This essentially identical with their </v>
<v Speaker 4>biological sex and almost everybody who </v>

996
00:59:19.370 --> 00:59:24.260
<v Speaker 4>is male and female by sex and gender </v>
<v Speaker 4>identity dresses that way.</v>

997
00:59:24.261 --> 00:59:26.630
<v Speaker 4>And that's what gender expression </v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially is.</v>

998
00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:29.990
<v Speaker 4>And then if you stack those three things</v>
<v Speaker 4>on top of each other,</v>

999
00:59:29.991 --> 00:59:30.824
<v Speaker 4>they're basically isomorphic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can add sexual orientation to that </v>

1000
00:59:33.531 --> 00:59:34.364
<v Speaker 4>and 98% of people are heterosexual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the idea that those things very </v>

1001
00:59:37.371 --> 00:59:41.210
<v Speaker 4>independently is absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 4>preposterous,</v>

1002
00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:45.980
<v Speaker 4>but it's written into the law and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>has terrible consequences.</v>

1003
00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:47.750
<v Speaker 4>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1004
00:59:47.751 --> 00:59:50.090
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now to what degree,</v>

1005
00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:50.953
<v Speaker 4>any discussion in universities of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>biological differences between men and </v>

1006
00:59:53.541 --> 00:59:55.460
<v Speaker 4>women are legal and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1007
00:59:55.461 --> 00:59:57.230
<v Speaker 4>well that's an exaggeration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1008
00:59:57.290 --> 01:00:00.170
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I debated Nicholas Matte,</v>

1009
01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:03.320
<v Speaker 4>I believe that was his name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A professor at the University of Toronto</v>

1010
01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:04.153
<v Speaker 4>on TV owes the agenda and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>write out for everyone to hear that the </v>

1011
01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:08.804
<v Speaker 4>scientific consensus is that there's no </v>
<v Speaker 4>biological differences between men and </v>

1012
01:00:12.051 --> 01:00:12.884
<v Speaker 4>women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I've received letters from people </v>

1013
01:00:14.481 --> 01:00:15.314
<v Speaker 4>who've told me that now the social </v>
<v Speaker 4>justice activist types are complaining </v>

1014
01:00:18.381 --> 01:00:22.820
<v Speaker 4>about the fact that the biologists </v>
<v Speaker 4>assign biological sex to animals because</v>

1015
01:00:22.821 --> 01:00:26.120
<v Speaker 4>it's only a social construct that we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>projecting onto their being.</v>

1016
01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:27.410
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1017
01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we just heard that the co,</v>

1018
01:00:29.241 --> 01:00:32.180
<v Speaker 4>the chromosomal level of analysis is </v>
<v Speaker 4>complex.</v>

1019
01:00:32.181 --> 01:00:33.014
<v Speaker 4>It's not that complex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What we have is a bi modal distribution </v>

1020
01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:38.360
<v Speaker 4>with a tiny number of exceptions in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1021
01:00:38.361 --> 01:00:40.070
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is not a spectrum.</v>

1022
01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.260
<v Speaker 4>You see these words?</v>

1023
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.760
<v Speaker 3>We're up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll have other questions.</v>

1024
01:00:46.050 --> 01:00:46.883
<v Speaker 5>Nope.</v>

1025
01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:55.590
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>professor Cossman,</v>

1026
01:00:55.650 --> 01:00:57.790
<v Speaker 3>it just sort of picking up on some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1027
01:00:57.830 --> 01:00:58.663
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>items that Professor Peterson just </v>

1028
01:01:00.391 --> 01:01:03.090
<v Speaker 3>mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was talking about social construction</v>

1029
01:01:03.091 --> 01:01:03.920
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

1030
01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:06.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that this is a very novel,</v>

1031
01:01:06.690 --> 01:01:09.390
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>issue when the law that like,</v>

1032
01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:10.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the uh,</v>

1033
01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:14.210
<v Speaker 3>see 16 one of the concerns about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if it isn't exactly,</v>

1034
01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.193
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the specific provisions of the </v>

1035
01:01:16.681 --> 01:01:17.514
<v Speaker 3>legislation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the fact that it's instantiating </v>

1036
01:01:19.531 --> 01:01:24.060
<v Speaker 3>this kind of social construction into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the realm of legal regulation.</v>

1037
01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:25.320
<v Speaker 3>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1038
01:01:25.321 --> 01:01:26.154
<v Speaker 3>you're an expert in law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have any thoughts or comments </v>

1039
01:01:28.441 --> 01:01:29.930
<v Speaker 3>about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1040
01:01:29.970 --> 01:01:32.880
<v Speaker 3>I think that any of us who are experts </v>
<v Speaker 3>in law would have something to say about</v>

1041
01:01:32.881 --> 01:01:33.510
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1042
01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:34.343
<v Speaker 3>the law has been regulating social </v>
<v Speaker 3>constructionism and social constructs </v>

1043
01:01:37.261 --> 01:01:39.030
<v Speaker 3>since there was law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1044
01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:40.830
<v Speaker 3>language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nationality,</v>

1045
01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:42.300
<v Speaker 3>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>citizenship,</v>

1046
01:01:42.301 --> 01:01:43.590
<v Speaker 3>family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>marriage.</v>

1047
01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:44.910
<v Speaker 3>There's no there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1048
01:01:45.010 --> 01:01:45.843
<v Speaker 3>there are social constructs are social </v>
<v Speaker 3>constructs go to the very root of our </v>

1049
01:01:50.161 --> 01:01:51.210
<v Speaker 3>common law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tradition,</v>

1050
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:52.830
<v Speaker 3>property,</v>
<v Speaker 3>property,</v>

1051
01:01:52.831 --> 01:01:53.461
<v Speaker 3>law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1052
01:01:53.461 --> 01:01:54.720
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Property exists.</v>

1053
01:01:55.050 --> 01:01:56.010
<v Speaker 3>It's there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1054
01:01:56.430 --> 01:01:57.263
<v Speaker 3>But the idea that we own it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that we own property is </v>

1055
01:02:00.571 --> 01:02:03.950
<v Speaker 3>entirely socially constructed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1056
01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:07.560
<v Speaker 3>intangible property futures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>contingent liabilities.</v>

1057
01:02:07.590 --> 01:02:09.780
<v Speaker 3>Where are they?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't feel them.</v>

1058
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:11.730
<v Speaker 3>I can't feel them there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where are they?</v>

1059
01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:15.900
<v Speaker 3>They're socially constructed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are the things that law regulates.</v>

1060
01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.820
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me talk about one that you know,</v>

1061
01:02:17.821 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 3>that Professor Peterson is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is quite fond</v>

1062
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:20.730
<v Speaker 6>of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1063
01:02:20.730 --> 01:02:21.563
<v Speaker 6>the right to freedom of expression.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is entirely a social construction </v>

1064
01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:26.303
<v Speaker 6>of the enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It didn't exist before the </v>

1065
01:02:27.991 --> 01:02:29.160
<v Speaker 6>enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1066
01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:30.293
<v Speaker 6>of humanism and of liberalism.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It depends on our understanding of </v>

1067
01:02:33.271 --> 01:02:34.104
<v Speaker 6>democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It depends on our understanding of what </v>

1068
01:02:36.001 --> 01:02:36.834
<v Speaker 6>a right is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It depends on our understanding of what </v>

1069
01:02:38.581 --> 01:02:39.414
<v Speaker 6>a freedom is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it depends on our understanding of </v>

1070
01:02:41.011 --> 01:02:41.844
<v Speaker 6>what expression is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The idea that the law regulates social </v>

1071
01:02:45.751 --> 01:02:46.584
<v Speaker 6>constructs is beyond irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't tell us anything about good </v>

1072
01:02:52.831 --> 01:02:55.530
<v Speaker 6>social constructs and bad social </v>
<v Speaker 6>constructs.</v>

1073
01:02:55.531 --> 01:02:59.400
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't tell us anything about good </v>
<v Speaker 6>laws versus bad laws.</v>

1074
01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:00.533
<v Speaker 6>And one of the things that Professor </v>
<v Speaker 6>Peterson seems to misunderstand is this </v>

1075
01:03:05.461 --> 01:03:10.461
<v Speaker 6>difference between the law as it is and </v>
<v Speaker 6>the law as he might like it to be.</v>

1076
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:14.130
<v Speaker 6>I have lots of disagreements with the </v>
<v Speaker 6>law as it is,</v>

1077
01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:15.173
<v Speaker 6>but what I've come and done here today </v>
<v Speaker 6>is explained to you what the law is </v>

1078
01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:24.750
<v Speaker 6>today and you might criticize it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's just what the law is.</v>

1079
01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:25.883
<v Speaker 6>And it disturbs me profoundly that </v>
<v Speaker 6>Professor Peterson without arguments or </v>

1080
01:03:30.541 --> 01:03:35.100
<v Speaker 6>support has done effectively a post </v>
<v Speaker 6>truth claim on me.</v>

1081
01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:37.560
<v Speaker 6>He has basically said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're wrong.</v>

1082
01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:40.380
<v Speaker 6>There's no arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's no evidence,</v>

1083
01:03:40.410 --> 01:03:41.243
<v Speaker 6>there's no support.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That my description of what the law is </v>

1084
01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:49.290
<v Speaker 6>as a 30 year expert in this field is </v>
<v Speaker 6>simply wrong.</v>

1085
01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:50.970
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1086
01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:51.983
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have some opinions on maybe how the </v>

1087
01:03:53.761 --> 01:03:56.590
<v Speaker 6>law ought to be,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but what I've done is I've common,</v>

1088
01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:57.453
<v Speaker 6>I've described how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's also I think a very important </v>

1089
01:03:59.971 --> 01:04:03.780
<v Speaker 6>distinction that's being missed here </v>
<v Speaker 6>about the penalties that are attached to</v>

1090
01:04:03.781 --> 01:04:06.450
<v Speaker 6>different laws.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Criminal laws involve imprisonment.</v>

1091
01:04:06.570 --> 01:04:09.360
<v Speaker 6>Civil laws involve damages and </v>
<v Speaker 6>restitution.</v>

1092
01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:10.703
<v Speaker 6>An Ontario Human Rights Commission </v>
<v Speaker 6>offense will result in a financial or a </v>

1093
01:04:14.371 --> 01:04:17.670
<v Speaker 6>non financial penalty such as rehiring </v>
<v Speaker 6>or training.</v>

1094
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.550
<v Speaker 6>So what happens if a person refuses to </v>
<v Speaker 6>pay the fine?</v>

1095
01:04:21.330 --> 01:04:24.180
<v Speaker 6>You don't get to go to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sorry.</v>

1096
01:04:24.181 --> 01:04:25.470
<v Speaker 6>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1097
01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:28.410
<v Speaker 6>the mechanisms of civil enforcement come</v>
<v Speaker 6>into effect.</v>

1098
01:04:28.650 --> 01:04:29.483
<v Speaker 6>The two most common forms of enforcing </v>
<v Speaker 6>judgements are seizure and sale of </v>

1099
01:04:32.791 --> 01:04:33.624
<v Speaker 6>assets.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if your assets do not sufficiently </v>

1100
01:04:37.051 --> 01:04:40.680
<v Speaker 6>cover the fine,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then your wages will be garnished.</v>

1101
01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:43.680
<v Speaker 6>It's about money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So yes,</v>

1102
01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:46.500
<v Speaker 6>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your assets might be seized,</v>

1103
01:04:46.770 --> 01:04:50.850
<v Speaker 6>your income might be garnished,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you don't get to go to jail.</v>

1104
01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:52.613
<v Speaker 6>Huh.</v>

1105
01:04:52.830 --> 01:04:57.830
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible]</v>

1106
01:04:59.930 --> 01:05:00.763
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we'll go back now to professor </v>

1107
01:05:02.151 --> 01:05:05.090
<v Speaker 3>Peterson cause there were two segments </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we've agreed that we,</v>

1108
01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:05.953
<v Speaker 3>we'd go back to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And actually I think you were just </v>

1109
01:05:07.611 --> 01:05:09.530
<v Speaker 3>starting at the end of your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1110
01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:10.453
<v Speaker 3>of your discussion in your answer to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>last question to talk a little bit </v>

1111
01:05:13.581 --> 01:05:14.330
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1112
01:05:14.330 --> 01:05:17.710
<v Speaker 3>some of the points that professor Bryson</v>
<v Speaker 3>made your,</v>

1113
01:05:17.711 --> 01:05:18.544
<v Speaker 3>your picture of gender and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the relationship between sex and </v>

1114
01:05:21.971 --> 01:05:25.090
<v Speaker 3>gender in some of those issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1115
01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:26.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

1116
01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:30.180
<v Speaker 3>she lays out some of the science and </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the actual scientific findings,</v>

1117
01:05:30.181 --> 01:05:31.480
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>around those,</v>

1118
01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:34.990
<v Speaker 3>around those issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I wonder when you,</v>

1119
01:05:35.170 --> 01:05:37.240
<v Speaker 3>when you take a look at some of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>research,</v>

1120
01:05:37.241 --> 01:05:39.520
<v Speaker 3>does it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how does it affect your,</v>

1121
01:05:39.730 --> 01:05:41.820
<v Speaker 3>your thinking on some of these questions</v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

1122
01:05:42.130 --> 01:05:42.963
<v Speaker 3>in particular the point some people </v>
<v Speaker 3>think of as perhaps a rather simplified </v>

1123
01:05:46.541 --> 01:05:47.700
<v Speaker 3>picture of sex and gender</v>

1124
01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:48.170
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1125
01:05:48.170 --> 01:05:49.100
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a couple of things.</v>

1126
01:05:49.101 --> 01:05:52.010
<v Speaker 4>The first thing I do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to make a quick comment about,</v>

1127
01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:53.203
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dr Crossman's critique of my analysis </v>

1128
01:05:55.581 --> 01:05:56.414
<v Speaker 4>because she actually didn't address it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't say that the law shouldn't </v>

1129
01:06:00.021 --> 01:06:03.290
<v Speaker 4>regulate social constructions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what the law does.</v>

1130
01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:06.320
<v Speaker 4>That's what she said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That isn't what I said.</v>

1131
01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:12.010
<v Speaker 4>I said that the law now builds in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>social constructionist doctrine into the</v>

1132
01:06:12.411 --> 01:06:15.200
<v Speaker 4>fabric of the law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not the same thing.</v>

1133
01:06:15.350 --> 01:06:16.183
<v Speaker 4>Obviously the law regulates property </v>
<v Speaker 4>rates in all of that and to some degree </v>

1134
01:06:19.191 --> 01:06:20.024
<v Speaker 4>those are social constructions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although not to the degree that she </v>

1135
01:06:21.651 --> 01:06:23.930
<v Speaker 4>claims,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is a whole different thing.</v>

1136
01:06:23.931 --> 01:06:24.764
<v Speaker 4>This builds in a philosophy I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>identity and one of the things that </v>

1137
01:06:26.721 --> 01:06:27.554
<v Speaker 4>builds in for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the claim that identity is only </v>

1138
01:06:29.391 --> 01:06:31.940
<v Speaker 4>subjectively defined and that's built </v>
<v Speaker 4>right in.</v>

1139
01:06:31.941 --> 01:06:34.880
<v Speaker 4>It says that your identity is whatever </v>
<v Speaker 4>you think it is.</v>

1140
01:06:35.030 --> 01:06:36.020
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me tell you,</v>

1141
01:06:36.021 --> 01:06:39.530
<v Speaker 4>as a practicing psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's absolute rubbish.</v>

1142
01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:44.810
<v Speaker 4>Your identity to look when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when children are two years old,</v>

1143
01:06:44.811 --> 01:06:48.230
<v Speaker 4>that's what they think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They think that their subjective reality</v>

1144
01:06:48.231 --> 01:06:49.064
<v Speaker 4>is everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what you do is you socialize them </v>

1145
01:06:50.511 --> 01:06:51.344
<v Speaker 4>between the ages of two and four to </v>
<v Speaker 4>adopt an identity that's part of a </v>

1146
01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:55.844
<v Speaker 4>cultural negotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like your identity as part of a </v>

1147
01:06:57.741 --> 01:06:58.574
<v Speaker 4>cultural negotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's partly the game you play in partly </v>

1148
01:07:00.771 --> 01:07:04.970
<v Speaker 4>the game that I play with you and I have</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be a voluntary participant in that.</v>

1149
01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:08.510
<v Speaker 4>And not only,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not only is it not subjectively defined,</v>

1150
01:07:08.511 --> 01:07:10.400
<v Speaker 4>which detaches it entirely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

1151
01:07:10.401 --> 01:07:11.234
<v Speaker 4>from the underlying biological and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>underlying objective reality making any </v>

1152
01:07:14.871 --> 01:07:17.450
<v Speaker 4>claim you want for your subjective </v>
<v Speaker 4>identity.</v>

1153
01:07:17.451 --> 01:07:20.420
<v Speaker 4>Valid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other thing it does is,</v>

1154
01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:21.583
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1155
01:07:25.150 --> 01:07:25.983
<v Speaker 4>it did completely oblivious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the idea that identity is actually </v>

1156
01:07:28.991 --> 01:07:33.790
<v Speaker 4>a Prac pragmatic entity for God's sake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you're a lawyer or a father</v>

1157
01:07:33.791 --> 01:07:34.624
<v Speaker 4>or mother,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like an identity that has some solidity </v>

1158
01:07:36.461 --> 01:07:37.360
<v Speaker 4>to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

1159
01:07:37.361 --> 01:07:38.830
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for most lawyers anyways,</v>

1160
01:07:39.130 --> 01:07:39.963
<v Speaker 4>so I'm sorry I couldn't help it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your identity is also a vehicle within </v>

1161
01:07:48.881 --> 01:07:50.440
<v Speaker 4>which you traveled through life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1162
01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:53.470
<v Speaker 4>It's a set of tools,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a set of pragmatic tools that you use to</v>

1163
01:07:53.471 --> 01:07:55.840
<v Speaker 4>interact with the social and the natural</v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

1164
01:07:56.050 --> 01:07:59.080
<v Speaker 4>It's not only your subjective whim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1165
01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:02.140
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so with regards to the science,</v>

1166
01:08:02.141 --> 01:08:04.690
<v Speaker 4>it's like really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1167
01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:07.810
<v Speaker 4>I can give you just one example and oh </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'll start with this and hopefully I</v>

1168
01:08:07.811 --> 01:08:12.010
<v Speaker 4>can do it quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea of gender identity,</v>

1169
01:08:12.090 --> 01:08:14.320
<v Speaker 4>which is only defined subjectively in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the,</v>

1170
01:08:14.321 --> 01:08:15.154
<v Speaker 4>in the relevant law has been studied </v>
<v Speaker 4>intensively by personality psychologist </v>

1171
01:08:17.811 --> 01:08:18.530
<v Speaker 4>such as myself.</v>

1172
01:08:18.530 --> 01:08:20.030
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my lab has done some of the,</v>

1173
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:22.400
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't say the most fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 4>research on it,</v>

1174
01:08:22.401 --> 01:08:23.234
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're in the boat and we're in the </v>

1175
01:08:23.841 --> 01:08:25.760
<v Speaker 4>ballpark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's a little story.</v>

1176
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:27.500
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the,</v>

1177
01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:30.860
<v Speaker 4>the differences between personality </v>
<v Speaker 4>between men and women are basically what</v>

1178
01:08:30.861 --> 01:08:31.694
<v Speaker 4>constitutes gender identity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in so far as it's not merely </v>

1179
01:08:33.711 --> 01:08:36.020
<v Speaker 4>subjective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that's happened is</v>

1180
01:08:36.021 --> 01:08:36.854
<v Speaker 4>that as the Scandinavian countries have </v>
<v Speaker 4>equalized their political and </v>

1181
01:08:39.921 --> 01:08:40.754
<v Speaker 4>sociological landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the differences in identity between men </v>

1182
01:08:44.001 --> 01:08:46.760
<v Speaker 4>and women have got larger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not smaller.</v>

1183
01:08:46.761 --> 01:08:47.594
<v Speaker 4>Do you understand that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a refutation of the social </v>

1184
01:08:50.130 --> 01:08:50.963
<v Speaker 4>constructionist claim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what happens is that if you flatten </v>

1185
01:08:54.051 --> 01:08:58.250
<v Speaker 4>out the landscape so that there are very</v>
<v Speaker 4>few socioeconomic differences say,</v>

1186
01:08:58.310 --> 01:09:01.070
<v Speaker 4>or sociological differences in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>treatment between men and women,</v>

1187
01:09:01.071 --> 01:09:04.610
<v Speaker 4>what happens is the biological </v>
<v Speaker 4>difference maximizes,</v>

1188
01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:08.960
<v Speaker 4>it maximizes the understand that means </v>
<v Speaker 4>men and women get more different,</v>

1189
01:09:08.961 --> 01:09:09.794
<v Speaker 4>not more the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the thing about women in the </v>

1190
01:09:11.511 --> 01:09:12.344
<v Speaker 4>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bloody hell you should think about this </v>

1191
01:09:13.641 --> 01:09:16.760
<v Speaker 4>because don't you want to pursue the </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that you're interested in?</v>

1192
01:09:17.210 --> 01:09:19.100
<v Speaker 4>And if you pursue the things that you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>interested in,</v>

1193
01:09:19.101 --> 01:09:21.110
<v Speaker 4>cause you're interested in different </v>
<v Speaker 4>things than men,</v>

1194
01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:23.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you look at the interest,</v>

1195
01:09:23.810 --> 01:09:27.290
<v Speaker 4>if you look at the interest variation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this has been established technically.</v>

1196
01:09:27.291 --> 01:09:28.124
<v Speaker 4>If you look at the interest variation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's almost no overlap between men </v>

1197
01:09:30.591 --> 01:09:31.424
<v Speaker 4>and women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you sum up the differences in </v>

1198
01:09:32.661 --> 01:09:34.070
<v Speaker 4>interest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>interest in temperament.</v>

1199
01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:36.350
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1200
01:09:36.350 --> 01:09:37.183
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1201
01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:46.253
<v Speaker 3>So I think that this provides perhaps a </v>
<v Speaker 3>good segway pat back to a professor </v>

1202
01:09:50.761 --> 01:09:51.770
<v Speaker 3>Bryson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1203
01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:55.250
<v Speaker 3>just to talk a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1204
01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:56.113
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but about some of the claims about in </v>

1205
01:09:57.991 --> 01:09:59.250
<v Speaker 3>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1206
01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:00.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1207
01:10:00.150 --> 01:10:03.270
<v Speaker 3>what does some of the evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does some of the,</v>

1208
01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:04.123
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's sort of the objective </v>

1209
01:10:05.731 --> 01:10:08.920
<v Speaker 3>realities in this situation that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>might hold on to</v>

1210
01:10:10.110 --> 01:10:14.490
<v Speaker 7>one objective reality is what happens </v>
<v Speaker 7>when you stop reading.</v>

1211
01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:15.773
<v Speaker 7>So I'm going to recommend that for </v>
<v Speaker 7>anyone who's interested in a current </v>

1212
01:10:20.221 --> 01:10:22.860
<v Speaker 7>review of the literature on sex,</v>
<v Speaker 7>gender,</v>

1213
01:10:22.861 --> 01:10:23.694
<v Speaker 7>and gender differences,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that you take a look at Rebecca Jordan </v>

1214
01:10:27.090 --> 01:10:27.923
<v Speaker 7>Young or an fosto sterling who provide </v>
<v Speaker 7>extraordinary and very detailed reviews </v>

1215
01:10:32.251 --> 01:10:33.084
<v Speaker 7>of this literature.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And actually it comes down to the fact </v>

1216
01:10:35.791 --> 01:10:40.110
<v Speaker 7>that science about causality,</v>
<v Speaker 7>about in essence,</v>

1217
01:10:40.111 --> 01:10:40.944
<v Speaker 7>sex being linked and producing gender </v>
<v Speaker 7>requires us to move outside of the </v>

1218
01:10:45.511 --> 01:10:46.344
<v Speaker 7>current realm.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All we have in this realm is quite high </v>

1219
01:10:48.721 --> 01:10:49.554
<v Speaker 7>experimentation.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We can't actually do studies where we </v>

1220
01:10:52.561 --> 01:10:55.980
<v Speaker 7>manipulate the chromosome or the </v>
<v Speaker 7>hormonal environment.</v>

1221
01:10:56.280 --> 01:11:01.280
<v Speaker 7>And so since we can't remove sexism and </v>
<v Speaker 7>misogyny from the production of gender,</v>

1222
01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:05.700
<v Speaker 7>we can actually reach conclusions about </v>
<v Speaker 7>what we take to be gender differences.</v>

1223
01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:10.530
<v Speaker 7>And so although it plays really well on </v>
<v Speaker 7>the cover of people magazine,</v>

1224
01:11:10.710 --> 01:11:12.300
<v Speaker 7>brain sex,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or whatever,</v>

1225
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:13.383
<v Speaker 7>a kind of arm chairs science that we </v>
<v Speaker 7>want to rely on for cocktail party Chit </v>

1226
01:11:19.290 --> 01:11:21.360
<v Speaker 7>Chat,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is not the stuff of nature.</v>

1227
01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:24.540
<v Speaker 7>And by nature I don't mean something </v>
<v Speaker 7>that we take for granted.</v>

1228
01:11:24.541 --> 01:11:26.790
<v Speaker 7>I mean the peer reviewed academic </v>
<v Speaker 7>journal.</v>

1229
01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:27.863
<v Speaker 7>So it's really good to keep reading if </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're going to be employed at a great </v>

1230
01:11:32.401 --> 01:11:37.401
<v Speaker 7>Canadian university</v>
<v Speaker 7>point to pronouns.</v>

1231
01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:40.710
<v Speaker 7>Let's put pronouns in some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 7>context.</v>

1232
01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:41.843
<v Speaker 7>And I think it's really helpful in going</v>
<v Speaker 7>back to what Justice Minister Wilson </v>

1233
01:11:46.290 --> 01:11:47.123
<v Speaker 7>Raybould said yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 7>following the passing of [inaudible] 16 </v>

1234
01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:50.423
<v Speaker 7>and I'll quote,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's our collective responsibility to </v>

1235
01:11:53.041 --> 01:11:53.874
<v Speaker 7>recognize and reduce the vulnerability </v>
<v Speaker 7>of Trans gender diverse person's to </v>

1236
01:11:57.421 --> 01:12:00.870
<v Speaker 7>discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hate crimes and hate propaganda.</v>

1237
01:12:01.170 --> 01:12:04.650
<v Speaker 7>And a lot of what we've been hearing </v>
<v Speaker 7>here is hate propaganda.</v>

1238
01:12:05.010 --> 01:12:05.843
<v Speaker 7>So what I want to say about pronouns is </v>
<v Speaker 7>that we have to get beyond this </v>

1239
01:12:09.231 --> 01:12:12.600
<v Speaker 7>simplistic discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is either about grammatical,</v>

1240
01:12:12.601 --> 01:12:14.790
<v Speaker 7>infelicity,</v>
<v Speaker 7>singular plural,</v>

1241
01:12:15.090 --> 01:12:15.923
<v Speaker 7>or that we should be nice to people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We actually have to deal with our </v>

1242
01:12:20.101 --> 01:12:20.934
<v Speaker 7>responsibility in creating institutional</v>
<v Speaker 7>climates that take very seriously the </v>

1243
01:12:25.681 --> 01:12:27.540
<v Speaker 7>goal of reducing inequality.</v>

1244
01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:31.140
<v Speaker 7>That has always been the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 7>goal of education.</v>

1245
01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:33.480
<v Speaker 7>So at the University of British </v>
<v Speaker 7>Columbia,</v>

1246
01:12:33.690 --> 01:12:34.523
<v Speaker 7>the trends to spirit and gender </v>
<v Speaker 7>diversity task force is looking at </v>

1247
01:12:37.831 --> 01:12:38.664
<v Speaker 7>everything in the context of what Greg </v>
<v Speaker 7>Bower and her amazing colleagues at </v>

1248
01:12:42.121 --> 01:12:47.040
<v Speaker 7>Trans Paul's call institutional and </v>
<v Speaker 7>informational eraser.</v>

1249
01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:50.520
<v Speaker 7>We are looking at housing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>student health,</v>

1250
01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:51.533
<v Speaker 7>how were trans and gender diverse </v>
<v Speaker 7>students going to go to student health </v>

1251
01:12:54.631 --> 01:12:58.920
<v Speaker 7>and get care that is both medically and </v>
<v Speaker 7>culturally competent.</v>

1252
01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:00.053
<v Speaker 7>How should we be organizing student </v>
<v Speaker 7>information systems so that people can </v>

1253
01:13:04.021 --> 01:13:04.854
<v Speaker 7>tell us their names and their pronouns?</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is a technical challenge only and </v>

1254
01:13:09.151 --> 01:13:11.250
<v Speaker 7>we have to rise to the challenge.</v>

1255
01:13:11.950 --> 01:13:12.320
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1256
01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:14.720
<v Speaker 3>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now I know that there is much,</v>

1257
01:13:14.721 --> 01:13:15.554
<v Speaker 3>much more to say an ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have some questions from the </v>

1258
01:13:18.021 --> 01:13:20.790
<v Speaker 3>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'd like to read those and,</v>

1259
01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:22.440
<v Speaker 3>and I'll try again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1260
01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:23.293
<v Speaker 3>just to divide up the time and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions are hopefully as fairly as </v>

1261
01:13:26.871 --> 01:13:28.310
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1262
01:13:28.340 --> 01:13:31.310
<v Speaker 3>so professor Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's start with you.</v>

1263
01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:32.840
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this question says,</v>

1264
01:13:33.470 --> 01:13:34.303
<v Speaker 3>you present your issue with bill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see 16 to be that the infringement of </v>

1265
01:13:37.971 --> 01:13:40.530
<v Speaker 3>freedom of expression regarding gender </v>
<v Speaker 3>pronouns.</v>

1266
01:13:40.531 --> 01:13:41.364
<v Speaker 3>See as a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you hold the same stance with other </v>

1267
01:13:43.971 --> 01:13:44.804
<v Speaker 3>discriminatory language and the human </v>
<v Speaker 3>rights code such as being able to use </v>

1268
01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:49.633
<v Speaker 3>racist terms with regard to students?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you believe that one of these </v>

1269
01:13:54.501 --> 01:13:57.140
<v Speaker 3>things is a violation but not the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

1270
01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:58.033
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure I read that over all that </v>

1271
01:13:59.331 --> 01:14:00.164
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

1272
01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:01.450
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So one,</v>

1273
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:02.343
<v Speaker 4>one thing I would like to point out </v>
<v Speaker 4>before I answer that just so you will </v>

1274
01:14:04.861 --> 01:14:09.861
<v Speaker 4>notice is that I have in fact been </v>
<v Speaker 4>denounced today and what I am saying has</v>

1275
01:14:10.541 --> 01:14:15.541
<v Speaker 4>in fact described as hate propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So one thing I'd like to suggest to you,</v>

1276
01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:19.300
<v Speaker 4>every single person in the audience </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're next.</v>

1277
01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:24.040
<v Speaker 4>So keep it in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

1278
01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:28.830
<v Speaker 4>So with regards to the question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well first of all,</v>

1279
01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that these issues are the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same.</v>

1280
01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:35.840
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they're the same at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1281
01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:38.420
<v Speaker 4>I think being thinking about the pronoun</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>

1282
01:14:38.421 --> 01:14:40.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because one of the things that people,</v>

1283
01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:41.093
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it put me back on my heels for a while </v>

1284
01:14:42.381 --> 01:14:44.330
<v Speaker 4>because the claim was basically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1285
01:14:44.331 --> 01:14:46.920
<v Speaker 4>it's something like why doesn't the mean</v>
<v Speaker 4>professor just play nice and,</v>

1286
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:49.310
<v Speaker 4>and respect people by using their </v>
<v Speaker 4>pronouns?</v>

1287
01:14:49.311 --> 01:14:50.144
<v Speaker 4>And it took me like three weeks to </v>
<v Speaker 4>unpack that because who gets questioned </v>

1288
01:14:52.761 --> 01:14:53.594
<v Speaker 4>about Pronoun use?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why the hell I use the </v>

1289
01:14:54.861 --> 01:14:55.694
<v Speaker 4>pronouns I use,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I use them because they're part of the </v>

1290
01:14:56.901 --> 01:14:58.160
<v Speaker 4>language I use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He and she,</v>

1291
01:14:58.161 --> 01:15:01.190
<v Speaker 4>because that's what everyone uses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then I had to think about,</v>

1292
01:15:01.191 --> 01:15:03.740
<v Speaker 4>well why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why do we in fact use pronouns?</v>

1293
01:15:03.741 --> 01:15:06.980
<v Speaker 4>And we use them in part for the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason that we use other categories.</v>

1294
01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:09.590
<v Speaker 4>And that's to simplify the world for </v>
<v Speaker 4>functional purposes.</v>

1295
01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:11.900
<v Speaker 4>Roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then I was thinking,</v>

1296
01:15:11.901 --> 01:15:12.734
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the use of he and she a mark of </v>

1297
01:15:14.151 --> 01:15:15.920
<v Speaker 4>respect?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the answer to that is,</v>

1298
01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:16.611
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1299
01:15:16.611 --> 01:15:17.444
<v Speaker 4>it's not a mark of respect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can't be a mark of what you call 4 </v>

1300
01:15:21.410 --> 01:15:23.540
<v Speaker 4>billion people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can't be a mark of respect.</v>

1301
01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:24.050
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1302
01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:27.680
<v Speaker 4>it's a mark of basic categorization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then the claim comes up,</v>

1303
01:15:27.681 --> 01:15:30.410
<v Speaker 4>well if someone wants you to use a </v>
<v Speaker 4>particular Pronoun,</v>

1304
01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:32.420
<v Speaker 4>then you're disrespecting them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you don't,</v>

1305
01:15:32.421 --> 01:15:33.254
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hmm,</v>

1306
01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:35.120
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's think that through a bit.</v>

1307
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:37.640
<v Speaker 4>Well that assumes that when I'm using he</v>
<v Speaker 4>or she for,</v>

1308
01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:38.533
<v Speaker 4>for people and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in normal parlance that I'm actually </v>

1309
01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:43.250
<v Speaker 4>indicating my respect for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's not true.</v>

1310
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:44.890
<v Speaker 4>It's like if I don't know you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1311
01:15:44.891 --> 01:15:49.580
<v Speaker 4>Claudius classify you generically and </v>
<v Speaker 4>basically I classify you in terms of how</v>

1312
01:15:49.581 --> 01:15:51.260
<v Speaker 4>you present yourself publicly.</v>

1313
01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:52.093
<v Speaker 4>I suppose that's your gender expression </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I nail you with whatever </v>

1314
01:15:55.311 --> 01:15:57.980
<v Speaker 4>pronoun and seems to fit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has nothing to do with respect.</v>

1315
01:15:57.981 --> 01:15:58.814
<v Speaker 4>And besides that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you bloody well don't get to demand my </v>

1316
01:16:00.861 --> 01:16:02.570
<v Speaker 4>respect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why should you,</v>

1317
01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:03.771
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1318
01:16:03.771 --> 01:16:06.770
<v Speaker 4>it's not like I respect everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a foolish thing to do.</v>

1319
01:16:06.771 --> 01:16:09.410
<v Speaker 4>You respect people who were respectable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1320
01:16:09.411 --> 01:16:10.244
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you make value distinctions between </v>

1321
01:16:11.511 --> 01:16:14.840
<v Speaker 4>people and that doesn't mean you </v>
<v Speaker 4>illegally discriminate against them.</v>

1322
01:16:14.841 --> 01:16:18.050
<v Speaker 4>Those aren't the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I'm all for value judgments.</v>

1323
01:16:18.051 --> 01:16:19.820
<v Speaker 4>If,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't buy value judgments,</v>

1324
01:16:19.821 --> 01:16:21.980
<v Speaker 4>then why bother learning anything?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why,</v>

1325
01:16:21.981 --> 01:16:22.814
<v Speaker 4>why bother doing anything?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why go from one point in your life to </v>

1326
01:16:25.521 --> 01:16:28.550
<v Speaker 4>another if the next point isn't better </v>
<v Speaker 4>in some manner?</v>

1327
01:16:28.970 --> 01:16:29.803
<v Speaker 4>So on telling me that I'm not respecting</v>
<v Speaker 4>people and I don't use their gender </v>

1328
01:16:32.211 --> 01:16:33.044
<v Speaker 4>pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the other thing is I don't buy this </v>

1329
01:16:34.791 --> 01:16:35.624
<v Speaker 4>whole idea that the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>putting this legislation forward are </v>

1330
01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:41.300
<v Speaker 4>valid representatives of the Trans </v>
<v Speaker 4>community.</v>

1331
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:42.223
<v Speaker 4>That's what they say they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have mechanisms for deciding whether </v>

1332
01:16:45.141 --> 01:16:45.974
<v Speaker 4>someone's a valid representative of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>community and that generally involves </v>

1333
01:16:48.381 --> 01:16:49.214
<v Speaker 4>democratic voting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've received at least 20 letters from </v>

1334
01:16:51.801 --> 01:16:54.500
<v Speaker 4>transsexual people who are on my side </v>
<v Speaker 4>and by the way,</v>

1335
01:16:54.501 --> 01:16:56.690
<v Speaker 4>zero from others,</v>
<v Speaker 4>believe it or not,</v>

1336
01:16:56.930 --> 01:17:00.170
<v Speaker 4>who are perfectly happy with the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 4>gendered pronouns.</v>

1337
01:17:00.171 --> 01:17:03.890
<v Speaker 4>It's just they want to be the other one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you can have a discussion about that</v>

1338
01:17:03.891 --> 01:17:05.540
<v Speaker 4>and there's lots of things to be said </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it,</v>

1339
01:17:05.541 --> 01:17:06.374
<v Speaker 4>but the idea that this community that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming out in these demanding rights is </v>

1340
01:17:09.621 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 4>somehow</v>

1341
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:13.130
<v Speaker 6>representative of this homogenous dough </v>
<v Speaker 6>press minority,</v>

1342
01:17:13.131 --> 01:17:14.240
<v Speaker 6>I think is rubbish.</v>

1343
01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:16.780
<v Speaker 3>Well that leads us to our next</v>

1344
01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:17.773
<v Speaker 5>question.</v>

1345
01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:26.973
<v Speaker 3>Question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to ask both the professor </v>

1346
01:17:29.231 --> 01:17:32.560
<v Speaker 3>cossman and professor Bryson to comment </v>
<v Speaker 3>on it.</v>

1347
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:33.783
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so one of the objectives of the </v>

1348
01:17:34.961 --> 01:17:35.794
<v Speaker 3>transgender and queer rights movement is</v>
<v Speaker 3>to enter into public conscience in a </v>

1349
01:17:39.821 --> 01:17:42.610
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this person asks,</v>

1350
01:17:42.910 --> 01:17:45.640
<v Speaker 3>this can only occur through public </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>

1351
01:17:46.330 --> 01:17:47.163
<v Speaker 3>Do you worry that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it may not be possible to have </v>

1352
01:17:49.691 --> 01:17:50.524
<v Speaker 3>thoughtful discussion if there is </v>
<v Speaker 3>government restriction about this kind </v>

1353
01:17:54.221 --> 01:17:56.950
<v Speaker 3>of speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And do you worry that it would skew,</v>

1354
01:17:56.951 --> 01:18:00.580
<v Speaker 3>discuss discussion in one direction or </v>
<v Speaker 3>another?</v>

1355
01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:02.200
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>still perhaps.</v>

1356
01:18:02.201 --> 01:18:05.220
<v Speaker 3>So professor cossman first and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>professor Bryson.</v>

1357
01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:08.113
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1358
01:18:08.430 --> 01:18:13.140
<v Speaker 6>So I've spent a career being concerned </v>
<v Speaker 6>about the way in which,</v>

1359
01:18:13.170 --> 01:18:15.740
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>thoughtful discussion is often shut down</v>

1360
01:18:16.170 --> 01:18:18.300
<v Speaker 6>and I've been concerned about it on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

1361
01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:19.193
<v Speaker 6>I think concerned about it on the left </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I've been concerned about it in the </v>

1362
01:18:21.181 --> 01:18:23.160
<v Speaker 6>mushy middle.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

1363
01:18:23.370 --> 01:18:24.203
<v Speaker 6>and I think that Professor Peterson has </v>
<v Speaker 6>actually performed some of this today </v>

1364
01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:28.193
<v Speaker 6>and so far as he just said that he was </v>
<v Speaker 6>denounced here today and that they're </v>

1365
01:18:32.281 --> 01:18:33.114
<v Speaker 6>going to come for you next.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the thing is about speech is it </v>

1366
01:18:36.601 --> 01:18:41.400
<v Speaker 6>everybody gets it and you say something </v>
<v Speaker 6>and you then get criticized.</v>

1367
01:18:41.730 --> 01:18:44.400
<v Speaker 6>So professor Peterson hasn't been </v>
<v Speaker 6>denounced.</v>

1368
01:18:44.430 --> 01:18:46.080
<v Speaker 6>Some might want to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1369
01:18:46.081 --> 01:18:51.081
<v Speaker 6>but he has been severely criticized and </v>
<v Speaker 6>that is actually what speech does.</v>

1370
01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:51.880
<v Speaker 6>That</v>

1371
01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:53.260
<v Speaker 5>is what speech does.</v>

1372
01:18:56.250 --> 01:18:57.720
<v Speaker 6>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1373
01:18:57.780 --> 01:19:01.410
<v Speaker 6>I think that there is an important way </v>
<v Speaker 6>to have public discussions,</v>

1374
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:03.900
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>around a whole range of issues.</v>

1375
01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:08.670
<v Speaker 6>I would welcome a discussion on the role</v>
<v Speaker 6>of hate speech provisions.</v>

1376
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:09.833
<v Speaker 6>I would welcome a discussion around the </v>
<v Speaker 6>role of hate speech and its </v>

1377
01:19:13.441 --> 01:19:15.280
<v Speaker 6>desirability,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1378
01:19:15.310 --> 01:19:16.143
<v Speaker 6>about whether the Supreme Court of </v>
<v Speaker 6>Canada is right or not right in </v>

1379
01:19:19.831 --> 01:19:20.664
<v Speaker 6>upholding its constitutionality.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I would like to have that debate </v>

1380
01:19:24.270 --> 01:19:27.030
<v Speaker 6>with someone who is knowledgeable about </v>
<v Speaker 6>the law.</v>

1381
01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:32.960
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

1382
01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:34.250
<v Speaker 3>And Professor Bryson,</v>

1383
01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:37.893
<v Speaker 7>one of the big questions that I had to </v>
<v Speaker 7>deal with in considering whether or not </v>

1384
01:19:41.801 --> 01:19:42.634
<v Speaker 7>to accept a very generous offer,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a invitation of the University of </v>

1385
01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:53.100
<v Speaker 7>Toronto to come here today would be the </v>
<v Speaker 7>impact of this event on Trans and gender</v>

1386
01:19:54.221 --> 01:19:56.030
<v Speaker 7>non binary people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1387
01:19:56.320 --> 01:20:00.280
<v Speaker 7>specifically at the University of </v>
<v Speaker 7>Toronto and much more generally.</v>

1388
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:01.623
<v Speaker 7>And so whereas I would say that I </v>
<v Speaker 7>recognize practices of peer review and </v>

1389
01:20:07.651 --> 01:20:12.651
<v Speaker 7>practices of peer review are not </v>
<v Speaker 7>denouncement practices of peer review,</v>

1390
01:20:12.871 --> 01:20:17.430
<v Speaker 7>our practices that we utilize to make </v>
<v Speaker 7>assessments about knowledge claims.</v>

1391
01:20:17.970 --> 01:20:18.803
<v Speaker 7>Whereas I would fully appreciate being </v>
<v Speaker 7>able to enter into a discussion about </v>

1392
01:20:23.461 --> 01:20:24.294
<v Speaker 7>gender and gender identity and issues </v>
<v Speaker 7>around trans culture as a means of </v>

1393
01:20:29.911 --> 01:20:30.744
<v Speaker 7>practicing peer review.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think the difficulty that we've had </v>

1394
01:20:34.351 --> 01:20:37.680
<v Speaker 7>and we've managed to reproduce this </v>
<v Speaker 7>difficulty here today,</v>

1395
01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:38.993
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>characterized just now by Dr. Peterson </v>

1396
01:20:42.210 --> 01:20:45.030
<v Speaker 7>as simplifying the world for functional </v>
<v Speaker 7>purposes,</v>

1397
01:20:45.330 --> 01:20:46.163
<v Speaker 7>simplifying the world for functional </v>
<v Speaker 7>purposes is not what I recognize to be </v>

1398
01:20:49.351 --> 01:20:50.640
<v Speaker 7>academic practice.</v>

1399
01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:51.713
<v Speaker 7>This is not how we relate to knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so I think that there's a concern </v>

1400
01:20:56.460 --> 01:21:01.440
<v Speaker 7>when we don't subject claims that are </v>
<v Speaker 7>being made as knowledge claims by people</v>

1401
01:21:01.441 --> 01:21:04.500
<v Speaker 7>who carry titles at great Canadian </v>
<v Speaker 7>universities.</v>

1402
01:21:04.890 --> 01:21:05.723
<v Speaker 7>When we don't treat those knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 7>claims in the same way that we would in </v>

1403
01:21:08.551 --> 01:21:09.384
<v Speaker 7>any other field.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And when their knowledge claims made </v>

1404
01:21:11.821 --> 01:21:16.140
<v Speaker 7>about members of minority groups and </v>
<v Speaker 7>bottled vulnerable,</v>

1405
01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:21.350
<v Speaker 7>marginalized members of minority groups,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then I think that we all need to be very</v>

1406
01:21:21.721 --> 01:21:22.554
<v Speaker 7>concerned about how it is that we're </v>
<v Speaker 7>changing what we think we do in the </v>

1407
01:21:25.861 --> 01:21:26.694
<v Speaker 7>university,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is supposed to be about the </v>

1408
01:21:28.711 --> 01:21:30.840
<v Speaker 7>advancement of knowledge and excellence.</v>

1409
01:21:31.950 --> 01:21:32.783
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

1410
01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:37.193
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1411
01:21:37.670 --> 01:21:39.950
<v Speaker 3>So it was sort of a slightly different </v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1412
01:21:40.370 --> 01:21:41.810
<v Speaker 3>line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but back to you,</v>

1413
01:21:41.811 --> 01:21:46.811
<v Speaker 3>Professor Peterson again from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>audience as a clinical psychologist,</v>

1414
01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:50.210
<v Speaker 3>refute it is Professor Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

1415
01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:51.373
<v Speaker 3>As a clinical psychologist refusing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>acknowledge how damaging it could </v>

1416
01:21:54.651 --> 01:21:58.340
<v Speaker 3>potentially be to an individual to </v>
<v Speaker 3>disregard their identity.</v>

1417
01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:00.673
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first thing I would like to say to </v>

1418
01:22:02.110 --> 01:22:04.750
<v Speaker 4>Mary Bryson is that this is an </v>
<v Speaker 4>invitation.</v>

1419
01:22:04.751 --> 01:22:09.190
<v Speaker 4>If she would like to debate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if she would like to debate,</v>

1420
01:22:09.250 --> 01:22:10.083
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the relationship between biology and </v>

1421
01:22:12.671 --> 01:22:13.504
<v Speaker 4>gender identity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm extending her an invitation to do </v>

1422
01:22:15.671 --> 01:22:16.504
<v Speaker 4>so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure that any number of student </v>

1423
01:22:18.371 --> 01:22:20.320
<v Speaker 4>groups would be more than happy to host </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1424
01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:21.453
<v Speaker 4>And I'll put my knowledge of the peer </v>
<v Speaker 4>reviewed literature against her </v>

1425
01:22:23.591 --> 01:22:25.720
<v Speaker 4>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here we go to the question though.</v>

1426
01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:28.960
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>identities,</v>

1427
01:22:28.961 --> 01:22:29.794
<v Speaker 4>a very complicated thing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I engage in clinical discussions </v>

1428
01:22:32.471 --> 01:22:34.390
<v Speaker 4>with my clients,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all about their identity.</v>

1429
01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:35.583
<v Speaker 4>And so the idea that it's a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>difficult question to even engage with </v>

1430
01:22:38.801 --> 01:22:42.550
<v Speaker 4>because I don't understand it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand it.</v>

1431
01:22:42.551 --> 01:22:45.760
<v Speaker 4>It makes things so simple that you can't</v>
<v Speaker 4>discuss them properly.</v>

1432
01:22:45.970 --> 01:22:46.803
<v Speaker 4>All I do in my clinical practice and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>have about 20,000 hours of experience </v>

1433
01:22:49.991 --> 01:22:53.950
<v Speaker 4>with clinical in my clinical practice </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've dealt with all sorts of people,</v>

1434
01:22:54.130 --> 01:22:57.790
<v Speaker 4>far more variation people than the </v>
<v Speaker 4>typical person ever encounters.</v>

1435
01:22:57.790 --> 01:22:58.623
<v Speaker 4>And I think I've done it at least </v>
<v Speaker 4>reasonably competently all my </v>

1436
01:23:01.571 --> 01:23:04.750
<v Speaker 4>discussions with people in my clinical </v>
<v Speaker 4>practice or about their identity,</v>

1437
01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:07.570
<v Speaker 4>given the definition of identity that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>brought forth,</v>

1438
01:23:07.690 --> 01:23:10.390
<v Speaker 4>how they feel about themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how they conceptualize themselves.</v>

1439
01:23:10.391 --> 01:23:13.720
<v Speaker 4>Cause those are two different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How that plays out in their interactions</v>

1440
01:23:13.721 --> 01:23:14.554
<v Speaker 4>with other people and what the </v>
<v Speaker 4>functional significance of that isn't </v>

1441
01:23:17.130 --> 01:23:19.840
<v Speaker 4>arm I'm going to save forthrightly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well two things.</v>

1442
01:23:19.841 --> 01:23:23.980
<v Speaker 4>One is that I don't believe that any of </v>
<v Speaker 4>my clients have had cause to worry about</v>

1443
01:23:23.981 --> 01:23:27.320
<v Speaker 4>my interpretation of their identity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because what I do in my practice is help</v>

1444
01:23:27.321 --> 01:23:29.320
<v Speaker 4>them discover what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm really,</v>

1445
01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:33.700
<v Speaker 4>I'm seriously not interested in imposing</v>
<v Speaker 4>any ideas of identity onto someone.</v>

1446
01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:36.460
<v Speaker 4>It's because I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't do that.</v>

1447
01:23:36.461 --> 01:23:40.210
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the right vehicle is </v>
<v Speaker 4>for you to travel through life.</v>

1448
01:23:40.211 --> 01:23:42.280
<v Speaker 4>What I can help you do is articulate </v>
<v Speaker 4>your concerns.</v>

1449
01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:45.070
<v Speaker 4>I can ask you questions where I see </v>
<v Speaker 4>contradictions in yourself.</v>

1450
01:23:45.130 --> 01:23:45.963
<v Speaker 4>Articulation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can help you make plans for the </v>

1451
01:23:47.621 --> 01:23:48.454
<v Speaker 4>future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I've helped thousands and thousands </v>

1452
01:23:50.290 --> 01:23:52.600
<v Speaker 4>and thousands of people by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make plans for the future with the stuff</v>

1453
01:23:52.601 --> 01:23:53.434
<v Speaker 4>that I do online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I'm helping people build a </v>

1454
01:23:55.361 --> 01:23:57.200
<v Speaker 4>genuine identity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1455
01:23:57.700 --> 01:23:58.780
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's what I do.</v>

1456
01:23:58.870 --> 01:24:02.710
<v Speaker 4>So that's the answer to that question </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think I do it well.</v>

1457
01:24:02.711 --> 01:24:03.544
<v Speaker 4>I mean in the stuff we've done from a </v>
<v Speaker 4>research perspective with the future </v>

1458
01:24:06.011 --> 01:24:06.844
<v Speaker 4>authoring program,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I offered to people free and week </v>

1459
01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:11.530
<v Speaker 4>and a half ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to help them catalyze their identities.</v>

1460
01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:12.753
<v Speaker 4>We've helped 5,000 university students </v>
<v Speaker 4>increase their grade point average 20% </v>

1461
01:24:17.231 --> 01:24:18.064
<v Speaker 4>and decrease their dropout by the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the biggest effect have it's been </v>

1462
01:24:21.011 --> 01:24:24.190
<v Speaker 4>with men and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and non Western ethnic minority students</v>

1463
01:24:24.191 --> 01:24:28.720
<v Speaker 4>who've accelerated their performance up </v>
<v Speaker 4>beyond the range of the normal for the,</v>

1464
01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:31.720
<v Speaker 4>for the dominant culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a pure psychological intervention,</v>

1465
01:24:31.721 --> 01:24:33.790
<v Speaker 4>I might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a a sociological intervention.</v>

1466
01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:34.893
<v Speaker 4>So I'm perfectly willing to stack my </v>
<v Speaker 4>record on identity formulation up </v>

1467
01:24:38.111 --> 01:24:41.350
<v Speaker 4>against anyone so and so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I should also point out,</v>

1468
01:24:41.650 --> 01:24:42.483
<v Speaker 4>I think where I'm most vulnerable in </v>
<v Speaker 4>this entire debate and I expect this </v>

1469
01:24:45.190 --> 01:24:46.023
<v Speaker 4>will happen and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's already been noise about it on </v>

1470
01:24:47.561 --> 01:24:49.720
<v Speaker 4>the Ontario Psychological Association </v>
<v Speaker 4>website.</v>

1471
01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:50.853
<v Speaker 4>I think they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they'll probably come after my </v>

1472
01:24:52.301 --> 01:24:54.970
<v Speaker 4>clinical license so that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that'd be my,</v>

1473
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:56.640
<v Speaker 4>that'd be my guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1474
01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:57.400
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1475
01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:00.400
<v Speaker 3>I think we might be straying a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>away from your question.</v>

1476
01:25:00.401 --> 01:25:01.234
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1477
01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:02.260
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just uh,</v>

1478
01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:03.310
<v Speaker 3>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1479
01:25:03.670 --> 01:25:04.503
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

1480
01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:05.570
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're doing because that,</v>

1481
01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:07.113
<v Speaker 2>that question</v>

1482
01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:08.433
<v Speaker 4>question involved my clinical practice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not straying a bit that involve my </v>

1483
01:25:12.101 --> 01:25:14.500
<v Speaker 4>clinical practice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there was a reason that the question</v>

1484
01:25:14.501 --> 01:25:16.580
<v Speaker 4>was posed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm not straying.</v>

1485
01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:18.553
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1486
01:25:25.230 --> 01:25:26.063
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the next question concerns how a free </v>

1487
01:25:30.391 --> 01:25:32.720
<v Speaker 3>and democratic society is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1488
01:25:32.721 --> 01:25:33.554
<v Speaker 3>how that idea is developed in this is I </v>
<v Speaker 3>guess particularly our for Professor </v>

1489
01:25:38.851 --> 01:25:40.890
<v Speaker 3>Cossman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you mentioned that,</v>

1490
01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:42.130
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

1491
01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:43.013
<v Speaker 3>freedom of expression and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>antidiscrimination equality provisions </v>

1492
01:25:46.711 --> 01:25:49.590
<v Speaker 3>of the charter are balanced through </v>
<v Speaker 3>section one,</v>

1493
01:25:50.010 --> 01:25:53.730
<v Speaker 3>which explicitly it's section one starts</v>
<v Speaker 3>out our charter.</v>

1494
01:25:54.010 --> 01:25:54.843
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it has this idea of free and </v>

1495
01:25:55.741 --> 01:25:58.110
<v Speaker 3>democratic society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how,</v>

1496
01:25:58.111 --> 01:26:02.160
<v Speaker 3>how is that idea established and who was</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of that discussion?</v>

1497
01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:09.400
<v Speaker 6>So the language of section one is that </v>
<v Speaker 6>all rights and freedoms contained in the</v>

1498
01:26:09.651 --> 01:26:10.484
<v Speaker 6>charter are subject to such reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 6>limits as are demonstrably justifiable </v>

1499
01:26:14.301 --> 01:26:17.030
<v Speaker 6>in a free and democratic society.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So like,</v>

1500
01:26:17.210 --> 01:26:19.550
<v Speaker 6>I didn't write those right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wasn't me.</v>

1501
01:26:19.850 --> 01:26:20.683
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was a whole bunch of folks back in </v>

1502
01:26:23.901 --> 01:26:24.734
<v Speaker 6>the late seventies and the early 1980s </v>
<v Speaker 6>where there was a constitutional </v>

1503
01:26:29.301 --> 01:26:33.380
<v Speaker 6>committees that decided what the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Canadian constitution would be.</v>

1504
01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:35.840
<v Speaker 6>It was parliament,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was the Senate,</v>

1505
01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:38.840
<v Speaker 6>it was all the provinces with the </v>
<v Speaker 6>exception of Quebec of course.</v>

1506
01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:39.993
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that came to an agreement that the </v>

1507
01:26:42.441 --> 01:26:45.680
<v Speaker 6>constitution would be our highest form </v>
<v Speaker 6>of law.</v>

1508
01:26:46.220 --> 01:26:48.500
<v Speaker 6>And it's also important,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a,</v>

1509
01:26:48.570 --> 01:26:50.900
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of misunderstanding around</v>
<v Speaker 6>the constitution.</v>

1510
01:26:50.901 --> 01:26:55.460
<v Speaker 6>So the constitution only restricts </v>
<v Speaker 6>government action.</v>

1511
01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:59.210
<v Speaker 6>It is not what's at play here in terms </v>
<v Speaker 6>of uh,</v>

1512
01:26:59.211 --> 01:27:00.520
<v Speaker 6>universities.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In fact,</v>

1513
01:27:00.530 --> 01:27:02.510
<v Speaker 6>the charter doesn't actually apply to </v>
<v Speaker 6>universities.</v>

1514
01:27:02.630 --> 01:27:05.570
<v Speaker 6>Human rights codes do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the charter does not.</v>

1515
01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:06.853
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and so the courts from the very early </v>

1516
01:27:08.721 --> 01:27:10.670
<v Speaker 6>times of when the Supreme Court of </v>
<v Speaker 6>Canada,</v>

1517
01:27:10.671 --> 01:27:13.670
<v Speaker 6>when it had to start interpret all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>charter rights,</v>

1518
01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:15.830
<v Speaker 6>there's section two B,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's freedom of expression.</v>

1519
01:27:15.831 --> 01:27:16.664
<v Speaker 6>There's freedom of religion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's the right to be free from </v>

1520
01:27:18.351 --> 01:27:20.900
<v Speaker 6>unreasonable search and seizure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's the right to life,</v>

1521
01:27:20.901 --> 01:27:23.540
<v Speaker 6>liberty and security of the person.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's the right to equality.</v>

1522
01:27:23.541 --> 01:27:24.374
<v Speaker 6>Before the law,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Supreme Court of Canada developed a </v>

1523
01:27:27.261 --> 01:27:32.261
<v Speaker 6>test whereby it said it was going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>figure out how to balance rights.</v>

1524
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:37.220
<v Speaker 6>And so if you have a violation of </v>
<v Speaker 6>section two be freedom of expression,</v>

1525
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:39.110
<v Speaker 6>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is quite a low bar,</v>

1526
01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:42.680
<v Speaker 6>anything that restricts speech is </v>
<v Speaker 6>considered to be a violation of that,</v>

1527
01:27:42.681 --> 01:27:43.514
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You then move to section one and the </v>

1528
01:27:45.891 --> 01:27:49.010
<v Speaker 6>court in a very early case called the </v>
<v Speaker 6>oaks case,</v>

1529
01:27:49.370 --> 01:27:54.370
<v Speaker 6>developed a test whereby it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it does that balancing first it looks to</v>

1530
01:27:54.381 --> 01:27:58.640
<v Speaker 6>see whether there are any pressing and </v>
<v Speaker 6>substantial objectives in the government</v>

1531
01:27:58.641 --> 01:28:02.510
<v Speaker 6>legislation that actually is limiting </v>
<v Speaker 6>those rights.</v>

1532
01:28:02.930 --> 01:28:03.763
<v Speaker 6>It then looks at if there are pressing </v>
<v Speaker 6>and substantial objectives and often in </v>

1533
01:28:07.461 --> 01:28:09.110
<v Speaker 6>the context of hate speech,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>

1534
01:28:09.290 --> 01:28:12.350
<v Speaker 6>that is about preventing discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there's many others as well.</v>

1535
01:28:12.730 --> 01:28:13.563
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it then looks to see whether the </v>

1536
01:28:14.571 --> 01:28:15.404
<v Speaker 6>violation of the speech is proportionate</v>
<v Speaker 6>to the pressing and substantial </v>

1537
01:28:20.121 --> 01:28:22.130
<v Speaker 6>government objective.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And there are many,</v>

1538
01:28:22.131 --> 01:28:26.480
<v Speaker 6>many legal steps along the way here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's complicated.</v>

1539
01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:31.780
<v Speaker 6>There are lots of steps and it is the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Supreme Court of Canada that does this.</v>

1540
01:28:32.150 --> 01:28:32.983
<v Speaker 6>It is the Supreme Court of Canada that </v>
<v Speaker 6>defines and ultimately decides how we </v>

1541
01:28:37.041 --> 01:28:39.860
<v Speaker 6>balance those rights.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Thank you.</v>

1542
01:28:40.990 --> 01:28:41.823
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so another question for Professor </v>

1543
01:28:44.741 --> 01:28:46.370
<v Speaker 3>Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1544
01:28:46.690 --> 01:28:47.523
<v Speaker 3>why do you feel that someone's personal </v>
<v Speaker 3>gender identity and pronouns infringes </v>

1545
01:28:50.981 --> 01:28:51.814
<v Speaker 3>your free speech?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can one not also argue based on your </v>

1546
01:28:54.521 --> 01:28:59.170
<v Speaker 3>interpretation that professors can use </v>
<v Speaker 3>racial slurs in their classroom?</v>

1547
01:28:59.250 --> 01:29:00.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

1548
01:29:00.630 --> 01:29:02.160
<v Speaker 3>that the inability to do</v>

1549
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:04.710
<v Speaker 4>so would violate their freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 4>speech?</v>

1550
01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:06.960
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's pretty much the same question.</v>

1551
01:29:06.961 --> 01:29:08.570
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1552
01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:16.113
<v Speaker 4>I think that we're crossing a dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 4>line and the line is the requirement </v>

1553
01:29:20.441 --> 01:29:21.274
<v Speaker 4>that's being put upon people by </v>
<v Speaker 4>government agencies with the full force </v>

1554
01:29:24.611 --> 01:29:29.611
<v Speaker 4>of the law behind them to decide what </v>
<v Speaker 4>language categories you're going to use.</v>

1555
01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:30.993
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a form of compelled </v>

1556
01:29:32.681 --> 01:29:34.900
<v Speaker 4>speech,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which has a technical meaning.</v>

1557
01:29:35.290 --> 01:29:36.123
<v Speaker 4>I know in the United States the American</v>
<v Speaker 4>Supreme Court ruled against the </v>

1558
01:29:39.701 --> 01:29:40.361
<v Speaker 4>government's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1559
01:29:40.361 --> 01:29:41.194
<v Speaker 4>Do you use compelled speech in 1943 I </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand that this isn't the United </v>

1560
01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:46.090
<v Speaker 4>States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we share a common law background and</v>

1561
01:29:46.450 --> 01:29:48.820
<v Speaker 4>the doctrines are relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1562
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.320
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see,</v>

1563
01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:53.290
<v Speaker 4>when I opened this debate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this forum,</v>

1564
01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:54.413
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tried to explain what this is about </v>

1565
01:29:56.111 --> 01:29:58.000
<v Speaker 4>and I couldn't explain everything and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's about,</v>

1566
01:29:58.001 --> 01:30:01.600
<v Speaker 4>because it's about too many things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But one of the things,</v>

1567
01:30:01.630 --> 01:30:02.463
<v Speaker 4>it's about his etiology and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>distinction between the left and the </v>

1568
01:30:06.551 --> 01:30:07.384
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And let's say now I truly believe that </v>

1569
01:30:11.171 --> 01:30:12.004
<v Speaker 4>these made up pronouns of which there </v>
<v Speaker 4>are many dozens in fact and there's no </v>

1570
01:30:16.661 --> 01:30:17.494
<v Speaker 4>consensus on them and that doesn't even </v>
<v Speaker 4>begin to start a discussion about the </v>

1571
01:30:21.641 --> 01:30:23.560
<v Speaker 4>use of the other kin pronouns.</v>

1572
01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:24.393
<v Speaker 4>And you can look those up if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if you can define your identity </v>

1573
01:30:27.401 --> 01:30:28.234
<v Speaker 4>subjectively any way you want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then there's absolutely no reason that </v>

1574
01:30:30.161 --> 01:30:33.220
<v Speaker 4>you can't claim a non human identity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you may not know.</v>

1575
01:30:33.221 --> 01:30:34.054
<v Speaker 4>But in the lgbt a rainbow coalition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is q plus and the q plus people </v>

1576
01:30:38.891 --> 01:30:39.724
<v Speaker 4>include the other kids who claim a non </v>
<v Speaker 4>human identity and they're arguing in </v>

1577
01:30:42.641 --> 01:30:45.610
<v Speaker 4>that rainbow coalition that they have </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same right to their,</v>

1578
01:30:45.900 --> 01:30:46.733
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to their pronouns that everyone else </v>

1579
01:30:48.221 --> 01:30:49.054
<v Speaker 4>does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And their pronouns includes such things </v>

1580
01:30:50.351 --> 01:30:54.340
<v Speaker 4>as work worms self.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not supposed to interrupt.</v>

1581
01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:56.073
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just going to ask if you could go </v>

1582
01:30:57.161 --> 01:31:00.470
<v Speaker 4>back to the point about the analogy </v>
<v Speaker 4>between,</v>

1583
01:31:00.530 --> 01:31:02.660
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the racial slur and the end.</v>

1584
01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:04.360
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's any analogy at </v>
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

1585
01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:08.500
<v Speaker 4>But the thing about difference between,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about compelled speech,</v>

1586
01:31:08.710 --> 01:31:09.543
<v Speaker 4>there's a difference between saying that</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something you can't say and </v>

1587
01:31:12.461 --> 01:31:15.190
<v Speaker 4>saying that there are things that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to say.</v>

1588
01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:16.293
<v Speaker 4>And I regard these made up pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of them as the neologisms of a </v>

1589
01:31:21.191 --> 01:31:25.420
<v Speaker 4>radical pc authoritarians.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you understand that?</v>

1590
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:28.510
<v Speaker 4>And I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a fan of that sort of person.</v>

1591
01:31:28.690 --> 01:31:29.523
<v Speaker 4>And the reason I'm not a fan of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of person is because I've done my </v>

1592
01:31:32.351 --> 01:31:33.184
<v Speaker 4>homework,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've read everything I can get my hands </v>

1593
01:31:35.081 --> 01:31:35.914
<v Speaker 4>on in the development of authoritarian </v>
<v Speaker 4>political systems and I know the </v>

1594
01:31:38.561 --> 01:31:39.394
<v Speaker 4>literature inside out and backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I am not going to be a mouthpiece </v>

1595
01:31:44.620 --> 01:31:47.160
<v Speaker 4>for language that ID test.</v>

1596
01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:52.860
<v Speaker 2>And that's [inaudible].</v>

1597
01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:04.590
<v Speaker 3>So we have one question left and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to what end?</v>

1598
01:32:04.591 --> 01:32:08.100
<v Speaker 3>It's for professor Bryson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Professor Bryson.</v>

1599
01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:09.013
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I noticed that you were on the vice </v>

1600
01:32:11.191 --> 01:32:16.191
<v Speaker 3>presidential task force at UBC for a two</v>
<v Speaker 3>spirited trans and other folks.</v>

1601
01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:17.933
<v Speaker 3>And I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is obviously been a difficult </v>

1602
01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:25.700
<v Speaker 3>debate for the University of Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but from your perspective as someone who</v>

1603
01:32:26.101 --> 01:32:26.934
<v Speaker 3>salt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So had a senior leadership role as well </v>

1604
01:32:28.891 --> 01:32:29.724
<v Speaker 3>as being an expert in the area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have any thoughts or guidance </v>

1605
01:32:32.551 --> 01:32:33.384
<v Speaker 3>about what universities can do to ensure</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're moving things forward in a </v>

1606
01:32:38.641 --> 01:32:40.110
<v Speaker 3>helpful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inclusive boy?</v>

1607
01:32:41.250 --> 01:32:42.240
<v Speaker 3>Let's talk about</v>

1608
01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:47.090
<v Speaker 7>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 7>So this week we heard from uh,</v>

1609
01:32:47.091 --> 01:32:47.924
<v Speaker 7>Justin Trudeau's government about the </v>
<v Speaker 7>apology that would meet be made to Lgbq </v>

1610
01:32:53.690 --> 01:32:55.610
<v Speaker 7>Canadians concerning,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1611
01:32:55.640 --> 01:33:00.640
<v Speaker 7>the extraordinarily violent impacts of </v>
<v Speaker 7>discriminatory activities that were also</v>

1612
01:33:02.241 --> 01:33:04.730
<v Speaker 7>research activities happening,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1613
01:33:04.731 --> 01:33:09.731
<v Speaker 7>at Canadian universities and elsewhere </v>
<v Speaker 7>to locate and to fire lgb Canadians from</v>

1614
01:33:11.361 --> 01:33:12.194
<v Speaker 7>the public service and from the rcmp.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And let's pay attention to some of the </v>

1615
01:33:16.701 --> 01:33:17.534
<v Speaker 7>details of that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can google the fruit machine and an </v>

1616
01:33:21.841 --> 01:33:25.190
<v Speaker 7>incredibly bogus apparatus that was </v>
<v Speaker 7>created,</v>

1617
01:33:25.460 --> 01:33:26.293
<v Speaker 7>let's say not coincidentally by a </v>
<v Speaker 7>psychologist at Carleton University Dr </v>

1618
01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:31.753
<v Speaker 7>Wake,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who was the chair of the psychology </v>

1619
01:33:32.871 --> 01:33:37.100
<v Speaker 7>department intended only to identify,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1620
01:33:37.170 --> 01:33:38.003
<v Speaker 7>supposedly homosexuals who then would be</v>
<v Speaker 7>fired from government service and from </v>

1621
01:33:42.591 --> 01:33:43.424
<v Speaker 7>the rcmp.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Those actions were carried out by means </v>

1622
01:33:47.481 --> 01:33:48.314
<v Speaker 7>in part of entirely bogus research </v>
<v Speaker 7>claims supported and funded by a </v>

1623
01:33:53.661 --> 01:33:56.930
<v Speaker 7>Canadian public university,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Carleton University.</v>

1624
01:33:58.010 --> 01:34:02.900
<v Speaker 7>If we fast forward to the fairly recent </v>
<v Speaker 7>past,</v>

1625
01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:08.080
<v Speaker 7>we could look at chem h making an </v>
<v Speaker 7>apology for the incredibly damaging work</v>

1626
01:34:08.211 --> 01:34:09.044
<v Speaker 7>carried out by Zucker in his focus </v>
<v Speaker 7>conversion therapy based entirely on </v>

1627
01:34:15.651 --> 01:34:19.250
<v Speaker 7>these ideas about sex producing gender </v>
<v Speaker 7>constancy,</v>

1628
01:34:19.550 --> 01:34:20.383
<v Speaker 7>which then in the case of gender diverse</v>
<v Speaker 7>young people could be cured by means of </v>

1629
01:34:24.621 --> 01:34:26.000
<v Speaker 7>conversion therapy.</v>

1630
01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:27.103
<v Speaker 7>Cam H had to apologize to the Canadian </v>
<v Speaker 7>public and to Ontarians for the harms </v>

1631
01:34:32.121 --> 01:34:32.954
<v Speaker 7>carried out by Dr Zucker.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so I think that we might need to </v>

1632
01:34:36.471 --> 01:34:39.320
<v Speaker 7>think about two things at the University</v>
<v Speaker 7>of Toronto.</v>

1633
01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:42.990
<v Speaker 7>And one would be an apology for any,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1634
01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:43.993
<v Speaker 7>damages to the right to safety and the </v>
<v Speaker 7>right to humanity on the part of Trans </v>

1635
01:34:48.891 --> 01:34:49.724
<v Speaker 7>and gender diverse people at the </v>
<v Speaker 7>university and in the great city of </v>

1636
01:34:52.821 --> 01:34:55.460
<v Speaker 7>Toronto more generally.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then of course,</v>

1637
01:34:55.461 --> 01:34:59.210
<v Speaker 7>the University of Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And perhaps it already is.</v>

1638
01:34:59.211 --> 01:35:01.340
<v Speaker 7>And I'm sure you know more about this </v>
<v Speaker 7>than I do,</v>

1639
01:35:01.730 --> 01:35:02.563
<v Speaker 7>could implement the kind of wide ranging</v>
<v Speaker 7>program to think very carefully about </v>

1640
01:35:07.341 --> 01:35:08.174
<v Speaker 7>how in an intelligent way to accommodate</v>
<v Speaker 7>gender diversity and Trans people in </v>

1641
01:35:12.711 --> 01:35:13.544
<v Speaker 7>this wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 7>great Canadian University that is the </v>

1642
01:35:17.330 --> 01:35:18.440
<v Speaker 7>University of Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Thank you.</v>

1643
01:35:22.810 --> 01:35:24.260
<v Speaker 7>We are,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we are at the</v>

1644
01:35:24.410 --> 01:35:26.300
<v Speaker 3>end of our time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1645
01:35:26.330 --> 01:35:28.940
<v Speaker 3>I would like to thank all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>participants,</v>

1646
01:35:28.970 --> 01:35:31.070
<v Speaker 3>the organizers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the many,</v>

1647
01:35:31.071 --> 01:35:31.904
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many staff who did a great job making </v>

1648
01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:37.130
<v Speaker 3>this forum happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course,</v>

1649
01:35:37.170 --> 01:35:39.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the members of the audience who came out</v>

1650
01:35:39.591 --> 01:35:42.320
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't so like to acknowledge,</v>

1651
01:35:42.321 --> 01:35:44.570
<v Speaker 3>and I think professor Bryson mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1652
01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:45.673
<v Speaker 3>that tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>November 20th is transgender day of </v>

1653
01:35:48.711 --> 01:35:52.830
<v Speaker 3>remembrance and that observes the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that many,</v>

1654
01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:53.703
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who many members of the transgender </v>

1655
01:35:55.071 --> 01:35:56.270
<v Speaker 3>community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1656
01:35:56.420 --> 01:36:00.170
<v Speaker 3>either lost their lives or were injured </v>
<v Speaker 3>in acts of violence.</v>

1657
01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:04.220
<v Speaker 3>And on a moment like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's worth remembering that the reason,</v>

1658
01:36:04.221 --> 01:36:05.054
<v Speaker 3>the legislation we're debating today and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're discussing today came into </v>

1659
01:36:08.421 --> 01:36:09.254
<v Speaker 3>existence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was to protect those communities from </v>

1660
01:36:11.931 --> 01:36:13.760
<v Speaker 3>those acts of violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The five,</v>

1661
01:36:13.761 --> 01:36:14.594
<v Speaker 3>19 at five 19 church street has a number</v>
<v Speaker 3>of activities and the U of t sexual and </v>

1662
01:36:20.511 --> 01:36:23.660

1664
01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:28.970
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't sure what to expect today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to say coming in as moderator.</v>

1665
01:36:29.570 --> 01:36:30.350
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

01:36:30.350 --> 01:36:35.350
<v Speaker 3>I just want to thank everyone once again</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the discussion and hope as we said,</v>

1667
01:36:35.751 --> 01:36:39.950
<v Speaker 3>that some illumination has happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is after all of what we seek to do</v>

1668
01:36:40.070 --> 01:36:41.900
<v Speaker 3>in the university.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

1669
01:36:42.940 --> 01:36:45.270
