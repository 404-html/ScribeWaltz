WEBVTT

1
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.263
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.130
<v Speaker 2>So I want to talk about some more </v>
<v Speaker 2>attributes of this structure.</v>

3
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.590
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

4
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:15.283
<v Speaker 2>broadly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're going to say is that a </v>

5
00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:19.280
<v Speaker 2>motivation sets up one of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>frameworks.</v>

6
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to call this framework a </v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

7
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.463
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lots of things you could call </v>

8
00:00:25.221 --> 00:00:26.930
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can call it an expectancy model.</v>

9
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.890
<v Speaker 2>You could call it a game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to call it a story,</v>

10
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:31.761
<v Speaker 2>and we're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

11
00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:32.594
<v Speaker 2>what you do is you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a life story and your life </v>

12
00:00:34.491 --> 00:00:37.100
<v Speaker 2>story is composed of nested some </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories.</v>

13
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.020
<v Speaker 2>You could also think of it as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality,</v>

14
00:00:39.021 --> 00:00:41.150
<v Speaker 2>but a story is like a personality </v>
<v Speaker 2>action.</v>

15
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.440
<v Speaker 2>So we'll just stick with story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The story has a starting place.</v>

16
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.840
<v Speaker 2>That's where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the story has an end point.</v>

17
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.720
<v Speaker 2>That's where you're going and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>always in one of those stories,</v>

18
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:51.680
<v Speaker 2>or you're asleep.</v>

19
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.563
<v Speaker 2>So you're either pursuing something in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the real world that is a value or your </v>

20
00:00:58.371 --> 00:01:00.500
<v Speaker 2>pr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's directly motivated,</v>

21
00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:01.334
<v Speaker 2>or you're pursuing another situation </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the reason you're pursuing it is </v>

22
00:01:04.671 --> 00:01:05.504
<v Speaker 2>because it fulfills a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivational states now and into the </v>

23
00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:09.200
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what you're doing.</v>

24
00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:14.060
<v Speaker 2>Say when you pursue a career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you're not doing that,</v>

25
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.923
<v Speaker 2>then your mind is wandering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what it's doing is it's wandering </v>

26
00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:18.644
<v Speaker 2>through the space of hypothetical worlds</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you could play hypothetic </v>

27
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.140
<v Speaker 2>hypothetical roles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're not doing that,</v>

28
00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:26.960
<v Speaker 2>then you're asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're in one of these all the time.</v>

29
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:28.723
<v Speaker 2>Now the shift and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things that's quite </v>

30
00:01:30.351 --> 00:01:34.160
<v Speaker 2>interesting about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The shift can take place on all sorts of</v>

31
00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:34.994
<v Speaker 2>levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can differently conceptualize the </v>

32
00:01:37.971 --> 00:01:38.804
<v Speaker 2>way where are you are you can different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we conceptualize where you're going and </v>

33
00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:43.334
<v Speaker 2>you can different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they conceptualize how you're going to </v>

34
00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:46.460
<v Speaker 2>get there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

35
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.550
<v Speaker 2>I won't go into that for the moment.</v>

36
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.953
<v Speaker 2>So let's say you're going from point a </v>
<v Speaker 2>to point B and at the highest level of </v>

37
00:01:58.711 --> 00:02:00.330
<v Speaker 2>resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means that you're acting.</v>

38
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.840
<v Speaker 2>And then other things that happened is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not only are you acting,</v>

39
00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:04.674
<v Speaker 2>you're configuring your perceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we already talked a little bit about </v>

40
00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:07.734
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what you should highlight what </v>

41
00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:10.524
<v Speaker 2>you should bring your high resolution </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking to bear on and you know what </v>

42
00:02:12.751 --> 00:02:13.584
<v Speaker 2>you should ignore and what you should </v>
<v Speaker 2>ignore is those things that are likely </v>

43
00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:17.304
<v Speaker 2>to remain constant as you pursue this </v>
<v Speaker 2>set of transformations and or that </v>

44
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.930
<v Speaker 2>aren't going to interfere with what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing.</v>

45
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.603
<v Speaker 2>And so you just have to concentrate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you set your environment </v>

46
00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:30.300
<v Speaker 2>that properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's another thing,</v>

47
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:31.134
<v Speaker 2>part of the way that people deal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the complexity of the world is by just </v>

48
00:02:34.411 --> 00:02:36.420
<v Speaker 2>not having it around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

49
00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:38.910
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you look in this room,</v>

50
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.990
<v Speaker 2>a lot of things are radically simplified</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that you don't get overwhelmed.</v>

51
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.690
<v Speaker 2>How many of you have computers here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

52
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Speaker 2>now what does your computer look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keyboard screen.</v>

53
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.200
<v Speaker 2>What about the rest of it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flat.</v>

54
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.020
<v Speaker 2>Shiny aluminum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

55
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.323
<v Speaker 2>Because you want to act like that's one </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing you don't want to act like it's </v>

56
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.500
<v Speaker 2>how many transistors are on a chip now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

57
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.883
<v Speaker 2>Billion or more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot like they're down to molecular </v>

58
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 2>size.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those things say they're so small.</v>

59
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:12.490
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a really funny,</v>

60
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.613
<v Speaker 2>there are so small now that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so imagine electrons reading along the </v>

61
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:19.120
<v Speaker 2>wire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the weird thing about an electron is</v>

62
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 2>it might be there and it might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere else.</v>

63
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.040
<v Speaker 2>So it's got this vague nonlocality about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

64
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe it's supposed to be there,</v>

65
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:30.190
<v Speaker 2>but it's actually over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would happen now and then,</v>

66
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:31.803
<v Speaker 2>but the wires are so damn thin now that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some good probability that the </v>

67
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:38.680
<v Speaker 2>electron will be outside the wire and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that causes short circuits.</v>

68
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.060
<v Speaker 2>So that's quite well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you got quantum level complexity,</v>

69
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 2>mucking up your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your circuitry in your computer.</v>

70
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.361
<v Speaker 2>But look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

71
00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 2>the computer is designed this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

72
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.050
<v Speaker 2>It's designed so you can ignore it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The outside of it's a flat shell.</v>

73
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.080
<v Speaker 2>It's a low resolution image and not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>keyboard because you have to move it,</v>

74
00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.800
<v Speaker 2>not the screen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everything else.</v>

75
00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:02.020
<v Speaker 2>It's like flat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The designer,</v>

76
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.950
<v Speaker 2>the primate designer of this computer </v>
<v Speaker 2>does not want your poor primate brain to</v>

77
00:04:05.951 --> 00:04:06.784
<v Speaker 2>be overwhelmed by the fact that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing is incomprehensibly complex cars </v>

78
00:04:10.361 --> 00:04:12.580
<v Speaker 2>are the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have that nice shiny shell on them.</v>

79
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.330
<v Speaker 2>And so that you can just sort of low </v>
<v Speaker 2>resolution at and that's good enough.</v>

80
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.790
<v Speaker 2>The walls painted roughly the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>color.</v>

81
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.350
<v Speaker 2>Like we're doing a lot of things around </v>
<v Speaker 2>us to to reduce the sensory load.</v>

82
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.350
<v Speaker 2>Plus there are people beating away at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the background,</v>

83
00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:29.020
<v Speaker 2>like mad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making sure the lights stay on,</v>

84
00:04:29.021 --> 00:04:30.850
<v Speaker 2>making sure the heat stays on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

85
00:04:30.851 --> 00:04:32.380
<v Speaker 2>making sure that you have Aaron here.</v>

86
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.213
<v Speaker 2>The place isn't burning down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there aren't crazy people wondering </v>

87
00:04:34.781 --> 00:04:35.614
<v Speaker 2>around here with shotguns and rifles and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's a lot going on so that you </v>

88
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:43.270
<v Speaker 2>can sit here and pretend that you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to stay alive.</v>

89
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.150
<v Speaker 2>So we're also removing a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of complexity as a consequence of</v>

90
00:04:49.151 --> 00:04:51.970
<v Speaker 2>social cooperation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

91
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.953
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so these are all parts of the way that </v>

92
00:04:55.721 --> 00:04:56.554
<v Speaker 2>you simplify the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in a radical simplification </v>

93
00:04:58.751 --> 00:05:00.670
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the external society.</v>

94
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.920
<v Speaker 2>Then within that there's only certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>things you want.</v>

95
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.590
<v Speaker 2>And then within that there's only </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain things you can detect.</v>

96
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.633
<v Speaker 2>And then with it in that there's only </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain features that pop out is </v>

97
00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:15.370
<v Speaker 2>necessary to contemplate in the realm </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're dealing with.</v>

98
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.260
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing you might ask is,</v>

99
00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:18.094
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what time span are you usually dealing </v>

100
00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:20.380
<v Speaker 2>with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

101
00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:22.840
<v Speaker 2>cause what the world's made of depends </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the timestamp.</v>

102
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:24.183
<v Speaker 2>And that's a tough one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that it's more than one 10th of </v>

103
00:05:25.661 --> 00:05:28.720
<v Speaker 2>a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can think years into the future,</v>

104
00:05:28.721 --> 00:05:30.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I might say,</v>

105
00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:33.580
<v Speaker 2>well why are you going to university?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or I might say,</v>

106
00:05:33.581 --> 00:05:37.360
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the answer would be,</v>

107
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.883
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sitting in class and then the </v>

108
00:05:39.701 --> 00:05:41.830
<v Speaker 2>question would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why are you sitting in class?</v>

109
00:05:41.831 --> 00:05:43.000
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

110
00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:47.440
<v Speaker 2>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to take this course and why?</v>

111
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because I want to get my degree.</v>

112
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.900
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

113
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.823
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I want to be prepared for a </v>

114
00:05:52.481 --> 00:05:53.740
<v Speaker 2>career and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

115
00:05:53.741 --> 00:05:56.710
<v Speaker 2>a productive and high quality life when </v>
<v Speaker 2>I get out.</v>

116
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.793
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

117
00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.251
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

118
00:05:58.251 --> 00:06:01.520
<v Speaker 2>you can keep saying why pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 2>indefinitely.</v>

119
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.413
<v Speaker 2>And as you answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go farther and farther out you and </v>

120
00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.720
<v Speaker 2>timescales.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

121
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.080
<v Speaker 2>it's a tricky thing because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things I might tell you,</v>

122
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.310
<v Speaker 2>this is a very complex cognitive problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

123
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where should you stop?</v>

124
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

125
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.850
<v Speaker 2>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

126
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.440
<v Speaker 2>I could say to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want $100 an hour?</v>

127
00:06:19.441 --> 00:06:23.350
<v Speaker 2>Do you want 50,000 years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In 75 years you're going to think,</v>

128
00:06:23.351 --> 00:06:25.770
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably take $100 now.</v>

129
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about 200 years?</v>

130
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.310
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm not going to be there.</v>

131
00:06:29.311 --> 00:06:30.870
<v Speaker 2>I'll take the hundred bucks now let's </v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

132
00:06:30.871 --> 00:06:33.300
<v Speaker 2>obviously thinking out 200 years is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>that helpful.</v>

133
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:34.980
<v Speaker 2>Now you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>

134
00:06:34.981 --> 00:06:38.280
<v Speaker 2>you should calculate the effects of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>actions on a,</v>

135
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:39.143
<v Speaker 2>the Va,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fastest time spam possible and </v>

136
00:06:41.791 --> 00:06:45.960
<v Speaker 2>include the largest number of people if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're really good and calibrate it.</v>

137
00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:50.340
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is you can't do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>computations cause you get,</v>

138
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.220
<v Speaker 2>you get this thing called combinatorial </v>
<v Speaker 2>explosion happening,</v>

139
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.050
<v Speaker 2>which is that it's like a chess board.</v>

140
00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.740
<v Speaker 2>You make one move,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay fine.</v>

141
00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:59.783
<v Speaker 2>But then you could make four and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>with each of those you could make four </v>

142
00:07:01.591 --> 00:07:02.424
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then with each of those you could </v>

143
00:07:02.911 --> 00:07:03.744
<v Speaker 2>make four more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And soon if you're looking 20 moves </v>

144
00:07:05.041 --> 00:07:06.960
<v Speaker 2>ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like there's so many moves that the</v>

145
00:07:06.961 --> 00:07:07.794
<v Speaker 2>other person could possibly make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That looking that far ahead is </v>

146
00:07:09.781 --> 00:07:10.614
<v Speaker 2>pointless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't do the computations and so we </v>

147
00:07:13.531 --> 00:07:15.780
<v Speaker 2>don't know how far you should look into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the future.</v>

148
00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.000
<v Speaker 2>It depends on how stable your </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment is,</v>

149
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.800
<v Speaker 2>but one month seems okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A year.</v>

150
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three to five years.</v>

151
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.640
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'll have you do when you do</v>
<v Speaker 2>the future authoring program.</v>

152
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:27.870
<v Speaker 2>20 years.</v>

153
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:29.613
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

154
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:33.840
<v Speaker 2>Probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is the margin of</v>

155
00:07:33.841 --> 00:07:34.674
<v Speaker 2>error in your prediction grows so large </v>
<v Speaker 2>that your prediction is worth anything </v>

156
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.633
<v Speaker 2>and you can really see how that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>case now cause like what's going to be </v>

157
00:07:41.131 --> 00:07:44.760
<v Speaker 2>like in 20 years when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to read science fiction.</v>

158
00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.670
<v Speaker 2>It was like plausible accounts of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential future.</v>

159
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:51.990
<v Speaker 2>It's like now who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything could happen.</v>

160
00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.270
<v Speaker 2>Anything could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

161
00:07:54.271 --> 00:07:56.490
<v Speaker 2>you could be three quarters robot in 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

162
00:07:56.491 --> 00:07:58.380
<v Speaker 2>You could have a lifespan of 10,000 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

163
00:07:58.381 --> 00:07:59.214
<v Speaker 2>I mean we just do not know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could be living in caves again with </v>

164
00:08:02.161 --> 00:08:02.994
<v Speaker 2>everything in ruins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have a clue what's going to </v>

165
00:08:04.561 --> 00:08:07.470
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So 20 year span I would say,</v>

166
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get friendly with computers,</v>

167
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.880
<v Speaker 2>20 year spans too long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So okay.</v>

168
00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:13.710
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm,</v>

169
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:16.860
<v Speaker 2>what I'm pointing out is that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to calculate,</v>

170
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:18.533
<v Speaker 2>you have to calculate what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>across multiple spans of time and in </v>

171
00:08:22.201 --> 00:08:25.050
<v Speaker 2>that combination in combination with </v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

172
00:08:25.051 --> 00:08:27.570
<v Speaker 2>many people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that makes things very complex.</v>

173
00:08:27.571 --> 00:08:28.404
<v Speaker 2>But that's how he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how you're building the </v>

174
00:08:29.221 --> 00:08:32.010
<v Speaker 2>structures that you live with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

175
00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:32.850
<v Speaker 2>So back to this,</v>

176
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.470
<v Speaker 2>you're ad point a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to point b.</v>

177
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.160
<v Speaker 2>So you are somewhere now that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

178
00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:45.540
<v Speaker 2>You are somewhat now generally what </v>
<v Speaker 2>people think about when they think about</v>

179
00:08:45.541 --> 00:08:49.230
<v Speaker 2>being somewhere is that they're in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>place but you're not just in a place,</v>

180
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:54.270
<v Speaker 2>you're in a place at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I really want to stress that because</v>

181
00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:55.373
<v Speaker 2>we know that universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that the environment is for </v>

182
00:08:57.001 --> 00:08:59.160
<v Speaker 2>dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not three dimension.</v>

183
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:00.713
<v Speaker 2>And that's important because you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be in the same place and in the </v>

184
00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:05.634
<v Speaker 2>next second you're still where you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you were in a completely different </v>

185
00:09:07.831 --> 00:09:09.030
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

186
00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:11.220
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone walked in here with a,</v>

187
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.060
<v Speaker 2>with a pistol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this would not be the same place.</v>

188
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:16.343
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a reason I'm telling you </v>

189
00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:19.464
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the future and that's </v>

190
00:09:20.701 --> 00:09:23.850
<v Speaker 2>also a place in time and a place in </v>
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>

191
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.610
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you're getting from one point to the</v>

192
00:09:26.611 --> 00:09:31.080
<v Speaker 2>other and you're going to do that by </v>
<v Speaker 2>implementing certain behaviors.</v>

193
00:09:31.081 --> 00:09:33.420
<v Speaker 2>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can happen while you're doing that?</v>

194
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's three things that can happen.</v>

195
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:42.380
<v Speaker 2>The thing you want that can happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something you don't want,</v>

196
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:47.040
<v Speaker 2>but that you understand and something </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand at all.</v>

197
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.620
<v Speaker 2>Something completely beyond your </v>
<v Speaker 2>comprehension,</v>

198
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.920
<v Speaker 2>and that would generally be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>traumatizing event of some force.</v>

199
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:57.120
<v Speaker 2>So you can even know what's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen or you can not know,</v>

200
00:09:57.121 --> 00:09:57.954
<v Speaker 2>but still be able to cope with it or you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can not know and not cope with it and </v>

201
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.840
<v Speaker 2>have the negative ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they correspond to that hierarchy,</v>

202
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.273
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's a little thing that you don't </v>

203
00:10:07.141 --> 00:10:09.180
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just modify a little behavior.</v>

204
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.910
<v Speaker 2>If it's a big thing that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>

205
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.480
<v Speaker 2>well then what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then everything falls apart.</v>

206
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:16.703
<v Speaker 2>You don't know where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know where you're going and all </v>

207
00:10:20.221 --> 00:10:23.700
<v Speaker 2>the behaviors you have are not helpful </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's when your world falls apart.</v>

208
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.910
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so generally that doesn't happen.</v>

209
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.720
<v Speaker 2>So I want to walk to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say I set my target on the door,</v>

210
00:10:30.721 --> 00:10:34.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to walk through the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's what happens instantly.</v>

211
00:10:34.171 --> 00:10:38.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm slightly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have slight negative emotion about the</v>

212
00:10:38.131 --> 00:10:38.964
<v Speaker 2>fact that any of you people in the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist because what my brain is doing is </v>

213
00:10:42.421 --> 00:10:47.340
<v Speaker 2>reconfiguring the world to chart a </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight path and anything that's in the</v>

214
00:10:47.341 --> 00:10:49.860
<v Speaker 2>way is going to make me uneasy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frustrated,</v>

215
00:10:49.861 --> 00:10:51.630
<v Speaker 2>disappointed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxious.</v>

216
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.690
<v Speaker 2>And you can think about this when you do</v>
<v Speaker 2>house designed by the way.</v>

217
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:55.853
<v Speaker 2>So when you're setting up a room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you want to do is figure out what </v>

218
00:10:58.321 --> 00:10:59.154
<v Speaker 2>the room is for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you want to clear the paths for </v>

219
00:11:01.261 --> 00:11:03.450
<v Speaker 2>that because then when you walk into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>

220
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.690
<v Speaker 2>the room will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>welcome.</v>

221
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.150
<v Speaker 2>You can do the things you want to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>here easily.</v>

222
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.250
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all cluttered up.</v>

223
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.113
<v Speaker 2>It's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no difference between that and </v>

224
00:11:14.731 --> 00:11:17.280
<v Speaker 2>being confused mentally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly the same thing.</v>

225
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.713
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

226
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.620
<v Speaker 2>so let's say now I stand up and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>works and then I walk that way.</v>

227
00:11:22.621 --> 00:11:23.454
<v Speaker 2>And that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that way I keep my eyes on the door </v>

228
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:28.800
<v Speaker 2>and I'm getting towards the door while </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm more modest,</v>

229
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.900
<v Speaker 2>Ma moderately positive about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm getting where I'm going.</v>

230
00:11:33.901 --> 00:11:34.734
<v Speaker 2>But I'm also moderately positive about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it because the fact that I'm getting </v>

231
00:11:38.011 --> 00:11:40.590
<v Speaker 2>where I'm going validates my whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>

232
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:42.713
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>behaviorists didn't get right when they </v>

233
00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:48.390
<v Speaker 2>were thinking about punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if an animal lays out a behavior,</v>

234
00:11:48.391 --> 00:11:51.180
<v Speaker 2>new punish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will stop manifesting that behavior.</v>

235
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:54.280
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that isn't all that happens.</v>

236
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:59.620
<v Speaker 2>You think about punishing a human being </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they start manifesting the behavior,</v>

237
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.290
<v Speaker 2>but the behavior isn't the whole damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

238
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.780
<v Speaker 2>The thing you're in is this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the whole thing.</v>

239
00:12:04.781 --> 00:12:05.614
<v Speaker 2>It's a conception of where they are to </v>
<v Speaker 2>conception of where they're going and </v>

240
00:12:07.751 --> 00:12:09.760
<v Speaker 2>it's all the behaviors that they might </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to get there.</v>

241
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:10.481
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

242
00:12:10.481 --> 00:12:12.910
<v Speaker 2>maybe they'll try to circumvent the </v>
<v Speaker 2>punishment,</v>

243
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.300
<v Speaker 2>walk around it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they'll try a few more behaviors.</v>

244
00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.820
<v Speaker 2>But what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

245
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.040
<v Speaker 2>so I'm tied by a chain and I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

246
00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:24.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm tied by a chain to the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started walking that way and I figured</v>

247
00:12:24.011 --> 00:12:25.450
<v Speaker 2>out that I'm chained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

248
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:28.390
<v Speaker 2>so much for that stupid theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not getting to the door.</v>

249
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:33.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to let that view of the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>disintegrate.</v>

250
00:12:33.341 --> 00:12:34.174
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be very upset about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I have to come up with another </v>

251
00:12:36.251 --> 00:12:37.300
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which might be,</v>

252
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:39.700
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do I get rid of the chain?</v>

253
00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:43.060
<v Speaker 2>So when you fail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two things happen.</v>

254
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.180
<v Speaker 2>The behavior that you're manifesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work.</v>

255
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:47.043
<v Speaker 2>That's the old behavior is routine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's worse than that because the </v>

256
00:12:51.131 --> 00:12:56.131
<v Speaker 2>whole little personality that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>using to construe the world falls apart.</v>

257
00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:02.170
<v Speaker 2>And the more important the thing is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>has fallen apart,</v>

258
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.990
<v Speaker 2>the more of a catastrophe it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be for you.</v>

259
00:13:04.991 --> 00:13:05.824
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say you're going to medical </v>

260
00:13:06.371 --> 00:13:07.420
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you want to do.</v>

261
00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.180
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're taking the course to write the</v>

262
00:13:10.181 --> 00:13:12.940
<v Speaker 2>exam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to pass the course with an a to apply to</v>

263
00:13:12.941 --> 00:13:14.500
<v Speaker 2>medical school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get into medical school,</v>

264
00:13:14.501 --> 00:13:16.510
<v Speaker 2>to become a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've failed the test.</v>

265
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:20.520
<v Speaker 2>What just happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

266
00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.960
<v Speaker 2>did your whole future fall apart?</v>

267
00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:23.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

268
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:25.310
<v Speaker 2>or did you just failed the task?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

269
00:13:25.311 --> 00:13:26.144
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

270
00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:31.130
<v Speaker 2>Maybe your whole future just fell apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like now you have a gpa of 3.3 it's</v>

271
00:13:31.131 --> 00:13:31.964
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nope,</v>

272
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.863
<v Speaker 2>you have to go to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to go to the Caribbean to a </v>

273
00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:35.564
<v Speaker 2>private medical school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to get in anywhere in </v>

274
00:13:37.521 --> 00:13:38.960
<v Speaker 2>Canada or the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

275
00:13:38.961 --> 00:13:40.040
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so your life over,</v>

276
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:41.420
<v Speaker 2>you jump off a bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

277
00:13:41.421 --> 00:13:46.421
<v Speaker 2>sometimes people do and it's because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>little subpersonality that they created,</v>

278
00:13:46.491 --> 00:13:49.340
<v Speaker 2>which is the me that will be a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of these things,</v>

279
00:13:49.341 --> 00:13:50.174
<v Speaker 2>a little story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so integral to their entire </v>

280
00:13:52.431 --> 00:13:53.264
<v Speaker 2>identity that when it collapses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're done and people get suicidal </v>

281
00:13:57.681 --> 00:14:00.170
<v Speaker 2>when that sort of thing happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

282
00:14:00.171 --> 00:14:00.561
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

283
00:14:00.561 --> 00:14:02.180
<v Speaker 2>what are you supposed to do when that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens?</v>

284
00:14:02.181 --> 00:14:04.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something that we'll talk about.</v>

285
00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.370
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the perspective of mental hygiene.</v>

286
00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.880
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I would recommend is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that when things go wrong for you,</v>

287
00:14:10.881 --> 00:14:11.714
<v Speaker 2>will you start at the highest level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>resolution in your hierarchy and work </v>

288
00:14:14.241 --> 00:14:15.350
<v Speaker 2>upward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't say,</v>

289
00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:17.300
<v Speaker 2>well God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now everything's over.</v>

290
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:18.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>

291
00:14:18.711 --> 00:14:22.820
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can I do to ensure that I do better</v>

292
00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:25.380
<v Speaker 2>on the next test?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you could,</v>

293
00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.790
<v Speaker 2>you could analyze your sub routines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your micro sub routines,</v>

294
00:14:28.791 --> 00:14:31.220
<v Speaker 2>like how much do you study a day?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

295
00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.190
<v Speaker 2>sometimes people will tell me I study </v>
<v Speaker 2>six hours a day.</v>

296
00:14:34.191 --> 00:14:34.671
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

297
00:14:34.671 --> 00:14:37.820
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sit in front of what you're supposed</v>

298
00:14:37.821 --> 00:14:38.654
<v Speaker 2>to be doing for six hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you actually study for more than </v>

299
00:14:40.911 --> 00:14:41.744
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be shocked because I've met </v>

300
00:14:43.191 --> 00:14:44.024
<v Speaker 2>almost no one in my entire life who can </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustain high level concentration for </v>

301
00:14:48.921 --> 00:14:53.480
<v Speaker 2>more than three hours for more six days </v>
<v Speaker 2>a week for more than a year,</v>

302
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.340
<v Speaker 2>you'll just burn yourself to a crisp.</v>

303
00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:56.173
<v Speaker 2>So No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're deluding yourself into thinking </v>

304
00:14:57.201 --> 00:14:58.610
<v Speaker 2>that you're studying for six hours a </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

305
00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:02.540
<v Speaker 2>You'd be way better off to cut it down </v>
<v Speaker 2>to two and a half and actually do it.</v>

306
00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:05.390
<v Speaker 2>Like there's micro routine analysis that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do,</v>

307
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:08.540
<v Speaker 2>so that might be helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you can implement that and run it.</v>

308
00:15:08.541 --> 00:15:10.440
<v Speaker 2>That's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a behavioral psychologist,</v>

309
00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.530
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone comes and says my life's over.</v>

310
00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.440
<v Speaker 2>And you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let's go for the micro routines.</v>

311
00:15:15.441 --> 00:15:17.960
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean when they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I can't be a doctor?</v>

312
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:19.363
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

313
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.340
<v Speaker 2>could you be a nurse?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would that work?</v>

314
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:27.400
<v Speaker 2>Could you be like a medical technician?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

315
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.360
<v Speaker 2>could you be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what else could you be?</v>

316
00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:31.970
<v Speaker 2>Could it be a social worker?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Et cetera.</v>

317
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.150
<v Speaker 2>Like okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so your,</v>

318
00:15:33.151 --> 00:15:36.470
<v Speaker 2>your domain is helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Medical type of person.</v>

319
00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.900
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one element of that is doctor,</v>

320
00:15:38.901 --> 00:15:42.260
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't exhaust the entire realm </v>
<v Speaker 2>of possibility.</v>

321
00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
<v Speaker 2>So I'd say like slacks up a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

322
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:46.213
<v Speaker 2>it's not the only path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that would be a more high level </v>

323
00:15:49.191 --> 00:15:50.024
<v Speaker 2>adjustment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be more cognitive adjustment if </v>

324
00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:52.760
<v Speaker 2>you were in cognitive behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 2>therapy.</v>

325
00:15:52.761 --> 00:15:54.620
<v Speaker 2>It's like let's check out your sub </v>
<v Speaker 2>routines,</v>

326
00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:56.810
<v Speaker 2>make you more effective at studying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

327
00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.180
<v Speaker 2>let's loosen up your top level </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstractions.</v>

328
00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:03.290
<v Speaker 2>You should be a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say whatever you decide that means</v>

329
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:04.513
<v Speaker 2>one element of that is be productively </v>
<v Speaker 2>employed in a way that doesn't make you </v>

330
00:16:07.971 --> 00:16:09.980
<v Speaker 2>bitter and nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

331
00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:10.963
<v Speaker 2>Doctor might be one way of solving that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I wouldn't be so sure about </v>

332
00:16:13.521 --> 00:16:16.310
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the only way of solving it.</v>

333
00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:22.420
<v Speaker 2>So all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go from point a to B,</v>

334
00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.290
<v Speaker 2>you go from point a to point b and </v>
<v Speaker 2>things can happen along the way.</v>

335
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.680
<v Speaker 2>Things you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive emotion you're getting there.</v>

336
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:34.790
<v Speaker 2>Plus you write things that produce </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative emotion,</v>

337
00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.710
<v Speaker 2>you're not getting there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

338
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:37.573
<v Speaker 2>You can either solve them easily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>small behavioral adjustment or you have </v>

339
00:16:40.191 --> 00:16:41.024
<v Speaker 2>to go up the hierarchy of value and </v>
<v Speaker 2>adjust it with the least possible </v>

340
00:16:46.521 --> 00:16:47.840
<v Speaker 2>damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generally speaking,</v>

341
00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:49.880
<v Speaker 2>cause that's another rule of thumb in </v>
<v Speaker 2>therapy.</v>

342
00:16:49.881 --> 00:16:50.714
<v Speaker 2>It's like</v>

343
00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:56.090
<v Speaker 2>I can't be a doctor so I'm going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>an engineer.</v>

344
00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.010
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>

345
00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.550
<v Speaker 2>you've got three years behind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't just throw it away,</v>

346
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:02.833
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>use what you've already got and make a </v>

347
00:17:03.921 --> 00:17:06.380
<v Speaker 2>minor course deviation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can do it.</v>

348
00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:07.643
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we could talk about broader scale </v>

349
00:17:09.081 --> 00:17:10.910
<v Speaker 2>transformations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're costly.</v>

350
00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.550
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stick as close to the path as you can,</v>

351
00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:16.790
<v Speaker 2>well altering it enough so that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>proceed on to your final goal.</v>

352
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.860
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

353
00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.460
<v Speaker 2>and that leads us and they think this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we'll stop today.</v>

354
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.410
<v Speaker 2>That leads us to the next part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

355
00:17:27.411 --> 00:17:30.710
<v Speaker 2>So here's the kind of story that someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>can tell.</v>

356
00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.170
<v Speaker 2>I was at point a and I went to point B </v>
<v Speaker 2>and here's how I did it.</v>

357
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:34.940
<v Speaker 2>And you're pretty happy about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

358
00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:38.750
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you go on to youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I found this a year ago,</v>

359
00:17:38.751 --> 00:17:41.300
<v Speaker 2>I had this old car and I wanted to put a</v>
<v Speaker 2>stereo in it.</v>

360
00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:42.493
<v Speaker 2>And so I typed in how to put a stereo in</v>
<v Speaker 2>x old car and there was some helpful </v>

361
00:17:45.771 --> 00:17:48.080
<v Speaker 2>retired southern guy who'd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

362
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:52.710
<v Speaker 2>made a youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was interested in his little story</v>

363
00:17:52.711 --> 00:17:55.020
<v Speaker 2>cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well he put a car stereo,</v>

364
00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.570
<v Speaker 2>he didn't have a car stereo in his car </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he wanted one.</v>

365
00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.240
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't have a car stereo in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>care and I wanted.</v>

366
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:03.690
<v Speaker 2>So here's a little story about how to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was very interesting to me.</v>

367
00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:07.140
<v Speaker 2>So I ran that little tape and I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

368
00:18:07.141 --> 00:18:09.240
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not particularly</v>

369
00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:13.570
<v Speaker 2>transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but good enough.</v>

370
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:15.430
<v Speaker 2>Good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got some information.</v>

371
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:17.140
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's an all right story.</v>

372
00:18:17.141 --> 00:18:21.040
<v Speaker 2>And you're running around all the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>interfacing with other people and you're</v>

373
00:18:21.041 --> 00:18:24.130
<v Speaker 2>telling them your little story and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're telling you their little story.</v>

374
00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:25.443
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's one thing that interests </v>

375
00:18:27.221 --> 00:18:28.780
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to do something successfully.</v>

376
00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:31.360
<v Speaker 2>But in a lot of what people talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>is something different,</v>

377
00:18:31.361 --> 00:18:35.290
<v Speaker 2>which is I was trying to get from point </v>
<v Speaker 2>a to B and it didn't work and now I'm at</v>

378
00:18:35.291 --> 00:18:38.170
<v Speaker 2>a place where it didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a problem,</v>

379
00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.033
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the world's opened up around </v>

380
00:18:40.691 --> 00:18:41.710
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to do.</v>

381
00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:43.293
<v Speaker 2>And the reason you talk to people about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is because they have brains and so </v>

382
00:18:46.571 --> 00:18:47.404
<v Speaker 2>to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you might as well have two brains </v>

383
00:18:48.071 --> 00:18:50.620
<v Speaker 2>working on the problem if you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're reciprocal,</v>

384
00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.280
<v Speaker 2>you know you're in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You come to me and we talk it out,</v>

385
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:58.390
<v Speaker 2>maybe I can help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then because we're playing a</v>

386
00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:00.620
<v Speaker 1>okay</v>

387
00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:03.260
<v Speaker 2>iterative game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you owe me a favor.</v>

388
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:04.783
<v Speaker 2>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be too restrictive </v>

389
00:19:06.801 --> 00:19:07.850
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

390
00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:11.210
<v Speaker 2>socially intelligent people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>reciprocal.</v>

391
00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:15.170
<v Speaker 2>And Ben Franklin once said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're new to the neighborhood.</v>

392
00:19:15.171 --> 00:19:15.671
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

393
00:19:15.671 --> 00:19:17.270
<v Speaker 2>what should you do to get integrated?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

394
00:19:17.271 --> 00:19:20.180
<v Speaker 2>ask a neighbor for a favor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A small favor.</v>

395
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.810
<v Speaker 2>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

396
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:22.670
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will you build me a new house?</v>

397
00:19:22.671 --> 00:19:23.181
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

398
00:19:23.181 --> 00:19:24.410
<v Speaker 2>that's not gonna work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

399
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:25.543
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

400
00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:27.240
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

401
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.630
<v Speaker 2>would you watch my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's my is on the law.</v>

402
00:19:29.631 --> 00:19:32.280
<v Speaker 2>And when you watch them for two minutes </v>
<v Speaker 2>while I run down to the corner store,</v>

403
00:19:32.281 --> 00:19:32.881
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

404
00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:33.714
<v Speaker 2>they can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well why would you do that while it </v>

405
00:19:34.921 --> 00:19:37.290
<v Speaker 2>opens up the possibility of reciprocal </v>
<v Speaker 2>exchange,</v>

406
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:38.423
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very smart because now they can ask you </v>

407
00:19:39.811 --> 00:19:41.760
<v Speaker 2>for a favor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you got the,</v>

408
00:19:41.761 --> 00:19:42.594
<v Speaker 2>you get the train thing going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people who are highly social are </v>

409
00:19:45.061 --> 00:19:45.894
<v Speaker 2>really good at Maine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>identifying and maintaining reciprocal </v>

410
00:19:48.751 --> 00:19:49.584
<v Speaker 2>obligations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we use each other as problem solving </v>

411
00:19:52.171 --> 00:19:53.004
<v Speaker 2>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of our communication is </v>

412
00:19:54.691 --> 00:19:55.524
<v Speaker 2>exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so basically the story you're </v>

413
00:19:56.731 --> 00:19:57.564
<v Speaker 2>telling isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at point a and I went to point b </v>

414
00:20:00.391 --> 00:20:02.520
<v Speaker 2>and everything worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The story is this.</v>

415
00:20:02.521 --> 00:20:07.050
<v Speaker 2>Instead</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's half of this,</v>

416
00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.250
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at point a,</v>

417
00:20:12.251 --> 00:20:13.084
<v Speaker 2>that's the top left hand corner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at point and I was going to point </v>

418
00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:15.714
<v Speaker 2>b,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but something didn't work and then </v>

419
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:19.620
<v Speaker 2>things collapsed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

420
00:20:19.621 --> 00:20:23.990
<v Speaker 2>to a greater or lesser extent depending </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the severity of the event you're,</v>

421
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:26.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the closeness of your friendships.</v>

422
00:20:26.631 --> 00:20:27.464
<v Speaker 2>So you're telling the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to tell cause </v>

423
00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:32.490
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic stories to someone on a bus</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you just sat down beside unless you</v>

424
00:20:32.491 --> 00:20:34.590
<v Speaker 2>have a mental illness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes,</v>

425
00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:36.000
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really it's the truth.</v>

426
00:20:36.001 --> 00:20:36.834
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you'll sit down on a bus and </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who has a mental illness will </v>

427
00:20:39.961 --> 00:20:40.794
<v Speaker 2>come and sit beside you and they will </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately tell you horrible things </v>

428
00:20:43.291 --> 00:20:44.124
<v Speaker 2>about their life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that they </v>

429
00:20:45.541 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 2>have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't anyone to talk to,</v>

430
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.860
<v Speaker 2>they can't sort out their brains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're so desperate,</v>

431
00:20:50.861 --> 00:20:53.620
<v Speaker 2>they're soul ruined any chaos.</v>

432
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:54.573
<v Speaker 2>They're so rude that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the proclivity to proclaim the </v>

433
00:21:00.761 --> 00:21:03.820
<v Speaker 2>chaos absolutely overwhelms them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're,</v>

434
00:21:03.821 --> 00:21:04.654
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just can't deal with someone like </v>

435
00:21:05.351 --> 00:21:06.184
<v Speaker 2>that most of the time because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>magnitude of the problem they're facing </v>

436
00:21:08.171 --> 00:21:11.170
<v Speaker 2>you with is way beyond your capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>solve.</v>

437
00:21:11.171 --> 00:21:12.970
<v Speaker 2>So it's just awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not good.</v>

438
00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:14.140
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say,</v>

439
00:21:14.141 --> 00:21:16.690
<v Speaker 2>I was going from point a to point b </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't work.</v>

440
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:17.583
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't know where I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where I'm going and I'm </v>

441
00:21:20.441 --> 00:21:22.540
<v Speaker 2>lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you say,</v>

442
00:21:22.541 --> 00:21:23.374
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what I experienced when I was in </v>

443
00:21:24.161 --> 00:21:24.994
<v Speaker 2>a situation like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did this and I know someone else who </v>

444
00:21:26.711 --> 00:21:29.920
<v Speaker 2>in that situation did this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe you could try those.</v>

445
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.310
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe you just shut up and you let </v>
<v Speaker 2>the person talk.</v>

446
00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:34.653
<v Speaker 2>And that's often extremely useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason you do that is because </v>

447
00:21:36.851 --> 00:21:40.030
<v Speaker 2>they're thinking because people think </v>
<v Speaker 2>they think,</v>

448
00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:40.893
<v Speaker 2>but they don't.</v>

449
00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:44.020
<v Speaker 2>They talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thinking is hard,</v>

450
00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.420
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very complex,</v>

451
00:21:46.421 --> 00:21:47.254
<v Speaker 2>abstract cognitive operation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think that there are many </v>

452
00:21:50.741 --> 00:21:51.574
<v Speaker 2>more people who can think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there are people who can really </v>

453
00:21:54.011 --> 00:21:55.940
<v Speaker 2>read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's probably two,</v>

454
00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:56.913
<v Speaker 2>two to 5% of the population at most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so most of the way that people deal </v>

455
00:22:00.071 --> 00:22:02.680
<v Speaker 2>with that is that they talk and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>their thinking.</v>

456
00:22:02.681 --> 00:22:05.980
<v Speaker 2>And so they have some ideas about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>might be going on,</v>

457
00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:06.963
<v Speaker 2>but they're mixed and muddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're basically throwing out these </v>

458
00:22:09.281 --> 00:22:10.750
<v Speaker 2>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

459
00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:13.390
<v Speaker 2>did this happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is He liked this as she liked that.</v>

460
00:22:13.391 --> 00:22:14.620
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did I do this?</v>

461
00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.870
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they watch you and you know,</v>

462
00:22:16.871 --> 00:22:17.704
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're nodding about one and they </v>

463
00:22:18.731 --> 00:22:19.331
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well,</v>

464
00:22:19.331 --> 00:22:20.164
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems plausible and they allowed </v>

465
00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:23.560
<v Speaker 2>another and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't even notice.</v>

466
00:22:23.561 --> 00:22:24.251
<v Speaker 2>And they think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

467
00:22:24.251 --> 00:22:25.180
<v Speaker 2>that's off the table.</v>

468
00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:26.620
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think that was a very good </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>

469
00:22:26.621 --> 00:22:28.750
<v Speaker 2>But now I've got some social,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

470
00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:31.060
<v Speaker 2>what do you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Validation.</v>

471
00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:35.230
<v Speaker 2>And soon they talk it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And instead of having 60 vaguely defined</v>

472
00:22:35.231 --> 00:22:36.064
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now they have like five fairly tightly </v>

473
00:22:38.501 --> 00:22:40.900
<v Speaker 2>defined problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're feeling a lot better about that,</v>

474
00:22:40.901 --> 00:22:42.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's five snakes instead of 60.</v>

475
00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.950
<v Speaker 2>And maybe they can deal with five </v>
<v Speaker 2>snakes.</v>

476
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:47.980
<v Speaker 2>So you've already helped them a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch just by listening,</v>

477
00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:49.323
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe you can be an active </v>

478
00:22:50.231 --> 00:22:53.080
<v Speaker 2>listener and they lay out their story </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you say,</v>

479
00:22:53.081 --> 00:22:54.670
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said something here that doesn't make</v>

480
00:22:54.671 --> 00:22:57.010
<v Speaker 2>any sense with this thing that you said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

481
00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:59.380
<v Speaker 2>how would you reconcile those?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

482
00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:00.333
<v Speaker 2>it's this dialectical process and so the</v>
<v Speaker 2>person collapses into chaos and they </v>

483
00:23:04.121 --> 00:23:04.954
<v Speaker 2>come and tell you about it and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>rescue them if you can out of the chaos </v>

484
00:23:08.111 --> 00:23:09.640
<v Speaker 2>and then they pop back up the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>

485
00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:12.313
<v Speaker 2>Clinical practice as actually a </v>
<v Speaker 2>formalized version of an ideal </v>

486
00:23:14.361 --> 00:23:17.870
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the ideal is you think,</v>

487
00:23:17.871 --> 00:23:20.000
<v Speaker 2>what's an ideal relationship?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

488
00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.313
<v Speaker 2>I would say it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ideal relationship is where both of </v>

489
00:23:23.241 --> 00:23:26.390
<v Speaker 2>you are trying to get better than you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are and you're helping each other do it.</v>

490
00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:29.750
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that and the lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

491
00:23:29.751 --> 00:23:30.584
<v Speaker 2>if I have a good relationship with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would rather that you're the best you </v>

492
00:23:32.531 --> 00:23:34.160
<v Speaker 2>you can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Vice,</v>

493
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:37.970
<v Speaker 2>I would assume that you would also like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that for me.</v>

494
00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.193
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things interfere with that because he </v>

495
00:23:40.251 --> 00:23:40.821
<v Speaker 2>might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

496
00:23:40.821 --> 00:23:41.654
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

497
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:46.490
<v Speaker 2>given how horrible I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if if my partner of a sudden got a clue,</v>

498
00:23:46.491 --> 00:23:48.470
<v Speaker 2>they'd leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I bet her interfere with that as much</v>

499
00:23:48.471 --> 00:23:50.690
<v Speaker 2>as I possibly can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people do that all the time.</v>

500
00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:51.853
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things they'll do is make </v>

501
00:23:52.521 --> 00:23:56.090
<v Speaker 2>sure their partners and to attract it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're so attracted,</v>

502
00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:57.440
<v Speaker 2>why are you with someone like me?</v>

503
00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.670
<v Speaker 2>It's like all criticized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't,</v>

504
00:23:58.671 --> 00:24:00.260
<v Speaker 2>you look attractive and that'll fix </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

505
00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:02.930
<v Speaker 2>So if people do that sort of thing all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>

506
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:07.100
<v Speaker 2>this is the revolutionary story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the real story.</v>

507
00:24:07.101 --> 00:24:07.934
<v Speaker 2>People tell I was here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got bloody well knocked off my perch </v>

508
00:24:12.531 --> 00:24:14.870
<v Speaker 2>and then for a while things were not </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

509
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:16.183
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

510
00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.490
<v Speaker 2>I reconfigured myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned some things,</v>

511
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:19.343
<v Speaker 2>I did some exploration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made some changes and poop off the </v>

512
00:24:21.741 --> 00:24:24.410
<v Speaker 2>other side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I come and I'm a better person for it.</v>

513
00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:27.680
<v Speaker 2>And if you listen to the way people talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about their pasts,</v>

514
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.110
<v Speaker 2>especially with regards to traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>events,</v>

515
00:24:30.111 --> 00:24:31.550
<v Speaker 2>they'll often tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll say,</v>

516
00:24:31.551 --> 00:24:31.971
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

517
00:24:31.971 --> 00:24:32.804
<v Speaker 2>in retrospect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the best thing that ever </v>

518
00:24:33.651 --> 00:24:34.484
<v Speaker 2>happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like those are the people who come </v>

519
00:24:35.751 --> 00:24:37.040
<v Speaker 2>out the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you,</v>

520
00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:38.173
<v Speaker 2>because lots of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they fall into the belly of the beast </v>

521
00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:43.040
<v Speaker 2>and they never come out.</v>

522
00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:46.850
<v Speaker 2>You see that in fairytales sometimes say</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there'd be a hero and heal,</v>

523
00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.713
<v Speaker 2>conquer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of dragging or some sort of </v>

524
00:24:48.801 --> 00:24:50.030
<v Speaker 2>monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when he cuts it open,</v>

525
00:24:50.031 --> 00:24:52.040
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of people who come out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

526
00:24:52.041 --> 00:24:53.780
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the ones who've got swallowed by</v>

527
00:24:53.781 --> 00:24:55.970
<v Speaker 2>the thing and it isn't till that person </v>
<v Speaker 2>came,</v>

528
00:24:55.971 --> 00:24:58.730
<v Speaker 2>comes along and solves the problem that </v>
<v Speaker 2>all those other people get to come out.</v>

529
00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:00.133
<v Speaker 2>So I have to revolutionary store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the archetypical revolutionary </v>

530
00:25:04.161 --> 00:25:08.030
<v Speaker 2>story and it's the story of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress socially,</v>

531
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:10.010
<v Speaker 2>politically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>economically,</v>

532
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.530
<v Speaker 2>and psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you see that reflected.</v>

533
00:25:12.531 --> 00:25:14.480
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I could tell you about</v>

534
00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:15.493
<v Speaker 2>Christianity is that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolutionary narrative at the </v>

535
00:25:17.811 --> 00:25:18.644
<v Speaker 2>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at the Bible structured </v>

536
00:25:20.211 --> 00:25:23.270
<v Speaker 2>as a piece of literature at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning there's a fall.</v>

537
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:26.930
<v Speaker 2>Everyone was doing fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they wake up and they find out that</v>

538
00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:31.520
<v Speaker 2>the bottom has dropped out and then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole rest of this book is about,</v>

539
00:25:31.521 --> 00:25:32.750
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you get back there?</v>

540
00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:37.220
<v Speaker 2>And actually it is in this all Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partly what the Bible is,</v>

541
00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:41.690
<v Speaker 2>is the attempt by broadly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Western civilization.</v>

542
00:25:41.691 --> 00:25:43.430
<v Speaker 2>So that would be all the way from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Middle East,</v>

543
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.353
<v Speaker 2>West.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the west attempt to figure out </v>

544
00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:49.730
<v Speaker 2>what's wrong with life and how to fix </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

545
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:51.280
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

546
00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:55.970
<v Speaker 2>it's the collaboration of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people over thousands of years.</v>

547
00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:59.660
<v Speaker 2>Of course you can say that about any </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancient moral tradition.</v>

548
00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:01.970
<v Speaker 2>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

549
00:26:01.971 --> 00:26:04.460
<v Speaker 2>is there an answer to the question?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>

550
00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.100
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the next things we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to try to figure it out.</v>

551
00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:12.641
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

552
00:26:12.641 --> 00:26:13.201
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

553
00:26:13.201 --> 00:26:15.310
<v Speaker 2>you're driving down the floor of one car</v>
<v Speaker 2>breaks down,</v>

554
00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.110
<v Speaker 2>you're off by the side of the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

555
00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:18.850
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's snowing.</v>

556
00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:20.470
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how bad is that?</v>

557
00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:21.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know.</v>

558
00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:25.240
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe someone slides on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one runs over you with your dad.</v>

559
00:26:25.241 --> 00:26:28.480
<v Speaker 2>It's really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're freaking out.</v>

560
00:26:28.481 --> 00:26:31.270
<v Speaker 2>Maybe your phone isn't working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so can check your phone.</v>

561
00:26:31.271 --> 00:26:32.104
<v Speaker 2>That's not working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like all of a sudden things have </v>

562
00:26:33.071 --> 00:26:33.904
<v Speaker 2>got worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this person drives up behind you and </v>

563
00:26:35.681 --> 00:26:36.514
<v Speaker 2>they stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a bit nervous about them because </v>

564
00:26:37.661 --> 00:26:38.950
<v Speaker 2>what are they up to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they come up,</v>

565
00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.350
<v Speaker 2>they opened the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they open the hood and they say,</v>

566
00:26:41.351 --> 00:26:43.000
<v Speaker 2>well this thing is loose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they put it in there.</v>

567
00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you happy?</v>

568
00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:45.683
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

569
00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.610
<v Speaker 2>because what's happened to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's magic.</v>

570
00:26:47.611 --> 00:26:48.444
<v Speaker 2>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not in a car as soon as it stops </v>

571
00:26:50.371 --> 00:26:50.790
<v Speaker 2>working.</v>

572
00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:53.070
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only a car when it's working,</v>

573
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.100
<v Speaker 2>when it's not working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

574
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:57.270
<v Speaker 2>it's a bag of snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

575
00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.260
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

576
00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.810
<v Speaker 2>this car isn't working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What could be long wrong with it?</v>

577
00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an infinite number of things.</v>

578
00:27:02.941 --> 00:27:06.210
<v Speaker 2>None of which I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then those things are on attached to</v>

579
00:27:06.211 --> 00:27:08.250
<v Speaker 2>people who are going to fix the car and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

580
00:27:08.251 --> 00:27:10.470
<v Speaker 2>can I trust them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I even know who they are?</v>

581
00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.560
<v Speaker 2>Are they going to empty my wallet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I need to have a new car?</v>

582
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:15.450
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't know.</v>

583
00:27:15.451 --> 00:27:18.120
<v Speaker 2>And then while your day's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

584
00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:20.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so all of a sudden what happens is your,</v>

585
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:21.803
<v Speaker 2>your environment complexifies radically </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you get all nervous because there's </v>

586
00:27:25.261 --> 00:27:26.094
<v Speaker 2>a lot of paths in there that you might </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to traverse to get back to where </v>

587
00:27:28.711 --> 00:27:30.930
<v Speaker 2>you're going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone comes along and goes tap.</v>

588
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.153
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all the complexity has collapsed </v>

589
00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:37.050
<v Speaker 2>and the one path and Poof,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're poof,</v>

590
00:27:37.051 --> 00:27:42.051
<v Speaker 2>your story is now implementable again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you'll pay people for that.</v>

591
00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:44.520
<v Speaker 2>You do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you got a problem,</v>

592
00:27:44.521 --> 00:27:46.320
<v Speaker 2>you take it to an expert and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

593
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:50.430
<v Speaker 2>it take you an infinite amount of time </v>
<v Speaker 2>to traverse all these possible paths.</v>

594
00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:53.040
<v Speaker 2>So you're basically screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you give me $100,</v>

595
00:27:53.041 --> 00:27:54.540
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you how to do it in five </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

596
00:27:54.541 --> 00:27:55.620
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

597
00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.480
<v Speaker 2>that's worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

598
00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.033
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

599
00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:01.560
<v Speaker 2>of course it's efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why we trade.</v>

600
00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:06.150
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly why we trade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like things are gonna go wrong with</v>

601
00:28:06.151 --> 00:28:08.880
<v Speaker 2>you that I could help and vice versa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a deal.</v>

602
00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.580
<v Speaker 2>That's partly why we're social and why </v>
<v Speaker 2>we maintain it.</v>

603
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.020
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a collective,</v>

604
00:28:13.021 --> 00:28:15.210
<v Speaker 2>we're way more intelligent than we would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

605
00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:16.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as one person.</v>

606
00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.740
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

607
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.903
<v Speaker 2>that's a revolutionary story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a collapse into the underworld </v>

608
00:28:24.811 --> 00:28:28.050
<v Speaker 2>and rebirth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so as soon as you know that,</v>

609
00:28:28.051 --> 00:28:32.220
<v Speaker 2>it's so cool to know that because now </v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever you read a classic story of any</v>

610
00:28:32.221 --> 00:28:32.910
<v Speaker 2>sort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can think,</v>

611
00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:34.470
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a voyage to the underworld.</v>

612
00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:37.980
<v Speaker 2>I've been there and you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's been there.</v>

613
00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.820
<v Speaker 2>The underworld is where that's chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's chaos.</v>

614
00:28:41.821 --> 00:28:43.890
<v Speaker 2>It's where you go when your life falls </v>
<v Speaker 2>apart.</v>

615
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:45.023
<v Speaker 2>It has a structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's even cooler about that is </v>

616
00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:50.820
<v Speaker 2>once you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's actually guides through it.</v>

617
00:28:50.821 --> 00:28:51.654
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

618
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.030
<v Speaker 2>your world fell apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do about it?</v>

619
00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:57.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dying of stress is a bad idea.</v>

620
00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:58.673
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was talking to one of the students </v>

621
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.233
<v Speaker 2>during break and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about character and I </v>

622
00:29:06.181 --> 00:29:07.014
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

623
00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:09.090
<v Speaker 2>the best thing you could do is build </v>
<v Speaker 2>your character.</v>

624
00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:12.480
<v Speaker 2>Here's a test of character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a family members dying.</v>

625
00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.570
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you useful or useless?</v>

626
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:18.960
<v Speaker 2>That's the first question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then a deeper question is,</v>

627
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:24.390
<v Speaker 2>do you make it as good as it can be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which isn't going to be that good by the</v>

628
00:29:24.391 --> 00:29:25.224
<v Speaker 2>way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or do you turn it into hell because he </v>

629
00:29:27.241 --> 00:29:29.130
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and lots of people do.</v>

630
00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:31.650
<v Speaker 2>So one of the tests of character is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

631
00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:33.000
<v Speaker 2>there's a crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

632
00:29:33.001 --> 00:29:33.834
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

633
00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:38.670
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to respond?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to be helpful?</v>

634
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:40.680
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to be useless?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or even worse,</v>

635
00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:43.630
<v Speaker 2>are you gonna make it worse?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say helpful.</v>

636
00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:47.800
<v Speaker 2>And the thing that's so cool about human</v>
<v Speaker 2>beings is that we can do that.</v>

637
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:49.383
<v Speaker 2>People are so tough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's insane as long as they put </v>

638
00:29:52.451 --> 00:29:53.284
<v Speaker 2>themselves in a position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My sister in law works is a palliative </v>

639
00:29:55.691 --> 00:29:56.524
<v Speaker 2>care nurse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like all she does is work with </v>

640
00:29:58.241 --> 00:29:59.770
<v Speaker 2>people who are going to die at two </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks.</v>

641
00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:04.480
<v Speaker 2>Like she's a happy person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partly cause she goes home and thinks,</v>

642
00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:06.310
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't a palliative care ward.</v>

643
00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:09.010
<v Speaker 2>Well really man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

644
00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.380
<v Speaker 2>things can be worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

645
00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.930
<v Speaker 2>and she knows that and she's reminded of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it every day.</v>

646
00:30:13.931 --> 00:30:16.870
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's a person who does not </v>
<v Speaker 2>take things for granted.</v>
