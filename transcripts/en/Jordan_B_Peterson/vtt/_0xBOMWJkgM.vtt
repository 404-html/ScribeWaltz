00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.793
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to psychology to 30 personality </v>

2
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.143
<v Speaker 1>and its transformations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called that because there are two </v>

3
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.613
<v Speaker 1>things that you have to take into </v>
<v Speaker 1>account when you're thinking about </v>

4
00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:21.724
<v Speaker 1>personality and one of those is</v>
<v Speaker 1>how personality stays the same across </v>

5
00:00:27.401 --> 00:00:28.234
<v Speaker 1>time and that's really what gives you </v>
<v Speaker 1>your identity and what allows you to </v>

6
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.550
<v Speaker 1>identify other people and then also help</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality changes.</v>

7
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.800
<v Speaker 2>We're going to</v>

8
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.570
<v Speaker 1>discuss both those things from a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>large number of perspectives</v>

9
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.560
<v Speaker 1>to find out all the information that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>need for the course.</v>

10
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.580
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is type my name into </v>
<v Speaker 1>a browser and you'll get my home page,</v>

11
00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:02.460
<v Speaker 1>which is the page that you see here on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the left.</v>

12
00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:04.980
<v Speaker 1>There's a table of contents that says </v>
<v Speaker 1>current course,</v>

13
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.640
<v Speaker 1>and then up here there's also a table of</v>
<v Speaker 1>contents that lists the courses and this</v>

14
00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:11.634
<v Speaker 1>one's this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then this is the introductory page </v>

15
00:01:15.511 --> 00:01:16.344
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can get to the course page </v>

16
00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:20.160
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really like blackboard,</v>

17
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.020
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to use this instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is easy to get to and everything</v>

18
00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:27.090
<v Speaker 1>you need to know about the core should </v>
<v Speaker 1>be here.</v>

19
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.370
<v Speaker 1>So we'll start with the very </v>
<v Speaker 1>straightforward things.</v>

20
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.373
<v Speaker 1>The first is there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two sources for reading in this </v>

21
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:38.874
<v Speaker 1>course and one is a paperback book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is called introduction to </v>

22
00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:44.454
<v Speaker 1>personality and its transformations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're both chapters that I selected </v>

23
00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:54.801
<v Speaker 1>from Classic Personality Textbook that </v>
<v Speaker 1>does a very good job of covering</v>

24
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.800
<v Speaker 1>classic personality theorists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although not such a good job of covering</v>

25
00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:06.000
<v Speaker 1>more recent work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The book was published in 1982.</v>

26
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.223
<v Speaker 1>Freud hasn't changed much since 1982,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there has been an awful lot of </v>

27
00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:16.180
<v Speaker 1>personality research and so that brings </v>
<v Speaker 1>us to the second source of readings.</v>

28
00:02:16.181 --> 00:02:19.380
<v Speaker 1>And the second source of readings is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually this webpage.</v>

29
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.160
<v Speaker 1>So if you go down the webpage to lecture</v>
<v Speaker 1>topics and readings,</v>

30
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.180
<v Speaker 1>you'll see in the third column a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>sequence of papers.</v>

31
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.003
<v Speaker 1>Now you have to pay attention to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>lectures and reading table more than </v>

32
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:36.240
<v Speaker 1>anything else because it tells you </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on for the for the duration</v>

33
00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>of the course and tell you what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lectures are.</v>

34
00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:40.590
<v Speaker 1>So today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

35
00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:41.424
<v Speaker 1>it's January seventh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we're doing an introduction and </v>

36
00:02:43.561 --> 00:02:45.810
<v Speaker 1>overview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I could make that a little bigger</v>

37
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.490
<v Speaker 1>and next week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no on,</v>

38
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.593
<v Speaker 1>on a Thursday we start with this reading</v>
<v Speaker 1>is called free forms of meaning in the </v>

39
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 1>management of complexity and all you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to use to get that reading is click</v>

40
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:06.334
<v Speaker 1>on it and then you get that reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a fairly straightforward </v>

41
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.650
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

42
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.863
<v Speaker 1>you would probably like the lectures </v>
<v Speaker 1>better if you do the readings </v>

43
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:16.924
<v Speaker 1>beforehand.</v>

44
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

45
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.730
<v Speaker 1>it isn't necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do this anyway you want,</v>

46
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.820
<v Speaker 1>but you'll get more out of the course I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think if you do that.</v>

47
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.903
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

48
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 1>there's two Ta's for this course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are also listed here.</v>

49
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.880
<v Speaker 1>One is Vanessa Gauche and the other is </v>
<v Speaker 1>victor swift.</v>

50
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:38.773
<v Speaker 1>Their availability is listed here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Vanessa is available from 4:45 to </v>

51
00:03:45.081 --> 00:03:50.081
<v Speaker 1>5:45 on Thursdays and victor is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is available from 3:15 to 4:50 tuesdays.</v>

52
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.213
<v Speaker 1>Their office offices are listed there as</v>
<v Speaker 1>are their email addresses so that you </v>

53
00:03:56.031 --> 00:03:56.864
<v Speaker 1>can get in touch with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My office hours are Wednesday from 4:15 </v>

54
00:04:02.451 --> 00:04:04.160
<v Speaker 1>to 5:45.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

55
00:04:04.161 --> 00:04:06.680
<v Speaker 1>the way I handled that is outside my </v>
<v Speaker 1>office,</v>

56
00:04:06.681 --> 00:04:09.980
<v Speaker 1>which is office four zero four six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also listed there.</v>

57
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.490
<v Speaker 1>There are a number of signup sheets that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to post on the wall.</v>

58
00:04:13.491 --> 00:04:15.800
<v Speaker 1>Do that right after class because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're printed out,</v>

59
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.100
<v Speaker 1>there's a number of signup sheets that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are listed on the wall and your best bet</v>

60
00:04:21.771 --> 00:04:24.690
<v Speaker 1>is just to take a 15 minute slot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

61
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.113
<v Speaker 1>don't take a whole bunch of them because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the student to teacher ratio in this </v>

62
00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:30.644
<v Speaker 1>class is obviously quite high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so just take one for now if you </v>

63
00:04:34.131 --> 00:04:34.964
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe if you have a meeting with me </v>

64
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.070
<v Speaker 1>you can check back later to see if </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's time for another one.</v>

65
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to have more time than that</v>

66
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.203
<v Speaker 1>available,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but 90 minutes is what I can spare this </v>

67
00:04:46.521 --> 00:04:50.090
<v Speaker 1>semester.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

68
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.290
<v Speaker 1>there'll be up today.</v>

69
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the mechanics of the course,</v>

70
00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.510
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no tricks.</v>

71
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two midterms.</v>

72
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.530
<v Speaker 1>The first one is February sixth and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>second one</v>

73
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:09.343
<v Speaker 1>is March 13th and there's also a final </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the midterm and the final is </v>

74
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.120
<v Speaker 1>essentially make up 75 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>

75
00:05:17.121 --> 00:05:20.000
<v Speaker 1>It's actually 77 point five percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the course,</v>

76
00:05:20.001 --> 00:05:24.080
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's two writing assignments.</v>

77
00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:25.693
<v Speaker 1>The first writing assignment is an essay</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the essay has a number of different </v>

78
00:05:30.681 --> 00:05:31.514
<v Speaker 1>due dates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're on the website you can go </v>

79
00:05:33.261 --> 00:05:34.094
<v Speaker 1>to writing assignments and then you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>see all these different topics that you </v>

80
00:05:39.051 --> 00:05:41.600
<v Speaker 1>can choose from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if you click on one of these,</v>

81
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.843
<v Speaker 1>you get to this little sign up sheet </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and then you can put in your name </v>

82
00:05:47.241 --> 00:05:48.074
<v Speaker 1>and your email address and that signs </v>
<v Speaker 1>you up for that topic and as you can </v>

83
00:05:53.631 --> 00:05:55.790
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 people can sign up for each topic.</v>

84
00:05:55.791 --> 00:05:56.624
<v Speaker 1>So if you're in with a particular topic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you should sign up sooner rather </v>

85
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:01.124
<v Speaker 1>than later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The due dates fall a little after the </v>

86
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.250
<v Speaker 1>course content that's related to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>topic,</v>

87
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:15.660
<v Speaker 1>so it will be the next class after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lectures on that topic and dark,</v>

88
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.700
<v Speaker 1>spread them out across the year so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ta's don't die,</v>

89
00:06:19.701 --> 00:06:20.534
<v Speaker 1>a frustration and so that you guys can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get your essays back with a reasonable </v>

90
00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:27.920
<v Speaker 1>degree of promptness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully within a week.</v>

91
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.220
<v Speaker 1>Although let's say two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems reasonable.</v>

92
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:33.403
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

93
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.590
<v Speaker 1>the second</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing exercise,</v>

94
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.810
<v Speaker 1>which is worth seven point five percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>BSA is worth 15 percent,</v>

95
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.453
<v Speaker 1>is a personality self analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part of a suite of programs that I </v>

96
00:06:52.571 --> 00:06:57.430
<v Speaker 1>designed called the cell fourth ring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweet and I can show you those</v>

97
00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.093
<v Speaker 1>and it's a cell phone ring.com</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll show you this video at some </v>

98
00:07:13.951 --> 00:07:15.330
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for now</v>

99
00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.170
<v Speaker 1>there's information here on these </v>
<v Speaker 1>programs,</v>

100
00:07:19.171 --> 00:07:24.090
<v Speaker 1>but I'll give you a username and </v>
<v Speaker 1>password so then you can complete these.</v>

101
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.133
<v Speaker 1>And what you'll be asked to do is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete an exercise that's based on a </v>

102
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:34.110
<v Speaker 1>big five model of adjective description </v>
<v Speaker 1>of personality.</v>

103
00:07:34.111 --> 00:07:34.944
<v Speaker 1>So since about 1930,</v>
<v Speaker 1>statisticians have been studying the </v>

104
00:07:40.381 --> 00:07:41.214
<v Speaker 1>structure of language at a sentence </v>
<v Speaker 1>level and add an adjective level to </v>

105
00:07:45.961 --> 00:07:46.794
<v Speaker 1>determine what the underlying </v>
<v Speaker 1>correlational structure of descriptive </v>

106
00:07:51.001 --> 00:07:55.290
<v Speaker 1>phrases as they apply to human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

107
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.333
<v Speaker 1>if you're happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talkative and that might be </v>

108
00:07:59.761 --> 00:08:00.594
<v Speaker 1>surprising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that those two things are </v>

109
00:08:02.731 --> 00:08:03.564
<v Speaker 1>tightly connected was one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was discovered by the factor </v>

110
00:08:06.631 --> 00:08:07.464
<v Speaker 1>analytic processes that lead to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>development of the big five and the big </v>

111
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.153
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're roughly five traits as the name </v>

112
00:08:13.921 --> 00:08:14.754
<v Speaker 1>might indicate extroversion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a positive emotion trade </v>

113
00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.080
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a negative emotion trait.</v>

114
00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:25.740
<v Speaker 1>Agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is warmth and empathy,</v>

115
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:26.783
<v Speaker 1>compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the other side of that is kind of </v>

116
00:08:29.161 --> 00:08:32.070
<v Speaker 1>a harsh coldness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

117
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.333
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>openness which is both intelligence and </v>

118
00:08:37.021 --> 00:08:37.854
<v Speaker 1>creativity and conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is industriousness and </v>

119
00:08:41.101 --> 00:08:44.670
<v Speaker 1>orderliness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there are virtues,</v>

120
00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:48.810
<v Speaker 1>so to speak and faults associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those dimensions.</v>

121
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.410
<v Speaker 1>So you can be too extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which makes you rather impulsive.</v>

122
00:08:52.411 --> 00:08:53.244
<v Speaker 1>And if you're very extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more difficult to good grades and </v>

123
00:08:55.681 --> 00:08:56.514
<v Speaker 1>university because you're always out </v>
<v Speaker 1>having fun with your friends and </v>

124
00:08:58.351 --> 00:08:59.184
<v Speaker 1>partying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that might be good in that it will </v>

125
00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:03.840
<v Speaker 1>help you develop a fairly extensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>social network,</v>

126
00:09:03.841 --> 00:09:04.674
<v Speaker 1>which is a useful thing if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with people who are useful </v>

127
00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:09.940
<v Speaker 1>for social networking purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

128
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:10.793
<v Speaker 1>but it can really interfere with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to sit by yourself and study if </v>

129
00:09:14.431 --> 00:09:15.264
<v Speaker 1>you're conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good predictor of academic </v>

130
00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:18.804
<v Speaker 1>success because conscientious people do </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they say they're going to do and </v>

131
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:25.314
<v Speaker 1>they seem to suffer shame and self </v>
<v Speaker 1>disgust and self contempt and guilt and </v>

132
00:09:28.681 --> 00:09:29.010
<v Speaker 1>so on.</v>

133
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.460
<v Speaker 1>If they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

134
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.800
<v Speaker 1>if you get too conscientious though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get quite</v>

135
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.810
<v Speaker 1>boxed in and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and orderly and narrow in orderliness by</v>

136
00:09:39.811 --> 00:09:42.520
<v Speaker 1>the way seems to be associated with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>railing,</v>

137
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.370
<v Speaker 1>political views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when it's extreme,</v>

138
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:45.900
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starts to get repressive.</v>

139
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:47.123
<v Speaker 1>And so the point of all this is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are five traits and they have </v>

140
00:09:50.701 --> 00:09:53.820
<v Speaker 1>positive and negative aspects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially at the extremes.</v>

141
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.850
<v Speaker 1>And these programs are set up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

142
00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:57.893
<v Speaker 1>so that you'll see a series of </v>
<v Speaker 1>adjectives that are universal </v>

143
00:10:00.751 --> 00:10:01.584
<v Speaker 1>descriptor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's basically a small set of </v>

144
00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:06.390
<v Speaker 1>adjectives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 that kind of cover each dimension of</v>

145
00:10:06.391 --> 00:10:09.630
<v Speaker 1>personality with a reasonable degree of </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensiveness.</v>

146
00:10:09.631 --> 00:10:10.464
<v Speaker 1>Then you'll be asked to pick which ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think are particularly relevant to </v>

147
00:10:14.191 --> 00:10:15.024
<v Speaker 1>you and then you'll be asked to narrow </v>
<v Speaker 1>that to a final list in one half of the </v>

148
00:10:19.741 --> 00:10:20.574
<v Speaker 1>exercise I'll list that represents your </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtues and then in the other half of </v>

149
00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:26.940
<v Speaker 1>the exercise a list that represents your</v>
<v Speaker 1>fault.</v>

150
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.013
<v Speaker 1>Then you'll be asked to describe a time </v>
<v Speaker 1>when not virtue played a positive role </v>

151
00:10:32.791 --> 00:10:33.624
<v Speaker 1>for you or when that fault interfered </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you and then you'll be asked to </v>

152
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:39.263
<v Speaker 1>describe how you might capitalize on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that virtue in the future or perhaps </v>

153
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.390
<v Speaker 1>Britain that fall under control in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

154
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:49.680
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out that writing exercises </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this sort,</v>

155
00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:55.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm are very practically useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a variety of positive effects.</v>

156
00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:02.240
<v Speaker 1>One of which seems to be an increase in </v>
<v Speaker 1>academic performance.</v>

157
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:03.263
<v Speaker 1>And our research so far has indicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that increase can be quite </v>

158
00:11:06.991 --> 00:11:11.730
<v Speaker 1>substantial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Among with similar programs.</v>

159
00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:12.683
<v Speaker 1>At Mcgill we raised the academic </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance of struggling university </v>

160
00:11:17.131 --> 00:11:17.964
<v Speaker 1>students by 25 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whole grade point and at a business </v>

161
00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:25.920
<v Speaker 1>school in Holland where this is being </v>
<v Speaker 1>studied in some depth,</v>

162
00:11:25.921 --> 00:11:26.754
<v Speaker 1>we've studied 2000 people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they actually did the future authoring </v>

163
00:11:30.391 --> 00:11:32.460
<v Speaker 1>program but not the present authoring </v>
<v Speaker 1>program,</v>

164
00:11:32.461 --> 00:11:33.294
<v Speaker 1>which is the one you're going to do and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we improve their overall academic </v>

165
00:11:36.811 --> 00:11:38.880
<v Speaker 1>achievement by about 30 percent as well.</v>

166
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.033
<v Speaker 1>Turns out that articulating yourself is </v>
<v Speaker 1>an extraordinarily useful thing to do </v>

167
00:11:45.911 --> 00:11:46.744
<v Speaker 1>and you could actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could also think about that in a </v>

168
00:11:50.281 --> 00:11:51.114
<v Speaker 1>more comprehensive way</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the goal of safe psychotherapy and </v>

169
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:55.803
<v Speaker 1>personality transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of what's happening as you mature </v>

170
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:02.230
<v Speaker 1>and develop as a personality is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you are,</v>

171
00:12:02.231 --> 00:12:03.064
<v Speaker 1>whatever that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's your behaviors and your </v>

172
00:12:05.561 --> 00:12:09.160
<v Speaker 1>potential and I don't know exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the potential is,</v>

173
00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:09.994
<v Speaker 1>but your behaviors and your potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be increasingly organized at a high </v>

174
00:12:14.561 --> 00:12:17.620
<v Speaker 1>level of consciousness articulated at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>high level of conscious.</v>

175
00:12:17.621 --> 00:12:18.454
<v Speaker 1>There's an articulation is a funny word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a because partly it means joint </v>

176
00:12:21.521 --> 00:12:22.900
<v Speaker 1>articulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

177
00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:23.753
<v Speaker 1>your hands are very articulated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why you can do a lot of things </v>

178
00:12:26.111 --> 00:12:29.410
<v Speaker 1>with them and hands and speech are very </v>
<v Speaker 1>tightly related,</v>

179
00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.513
<v Speaker 1>which is why most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech centers are in the same </v>

180
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.870
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere as their dominant hand.</v>

181
00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.073
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Articulating yourself makes you able to </v>

182
00:12:38.351 --> 00:12:39.184
<v Speaker 1>do many more things with yourself and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>also seems to quell your negative </v>

183
00:12:42.521 --> 00:12:45.270
<v Speaker 1>emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because it's clarifying you.</v>

184
00:12:45.271 --> 00:12:48.400
<v Speaker 1>You know the more you leave things muddy</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your life,</v>

185
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:49.263
<v Speaker 1>the less defined things are around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more active your stress response </v>

186
00:12:53.141 --> 00:12:55.870
<v Speaker 1>systems are because if things are murky </v>
<v Speaker 1>and undefined,</v>

187
00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.710
<v Speaker 1>your stress systems basically assumed </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are alligators and snakes and</v>

188
00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:00.783
<v Speaker 1>predators hiding all that fog and gloom </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that you're in a very dangerous </v>

189
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.313
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you clarify that with careful </v>

190
00:13:07.031 --> 00:13:11.020
<v Speaker 1>attention and articulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can clear away the fog and the gloom</v>

191
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:12.063
<v Speaker 1>and that only leaves you with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual problems which once defined </v>

192
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:18.730
<v Speaker 1>carefully you might find manageable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>an example that would be.</v>

193
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.193
<v Speaker 1>You know when you go into your room and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you haven't done your homework for </v>

194
00:13:22.751 --> 00:13:27.010
<v Speaker 1>awhile and there's piles of papers </v>
<v Speaker 1>piling up or maybe there's piles of junk</v>

195
00:13:27.011 --> 00:13:30.250
<v Speaker 1>on your computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really matter and you'll have</v>

196
00:13:30.251 --> 00:13:34.120
<v Speaker 1>a very powerful tendency to avoid that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even to look at it,</v>

197
00:13:34.121 --> 00:13:34.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

198
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:37.300
<v Speaker 1>You don't even want to look at it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's and that's chaos.</v>

199
00:13:37.301 --> 00:13:38.134
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of growing in your environment</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a specific part of your </v>

200
00:13:41.231 --> 00:13:42.064
<v Speaker 1>brain which evolved to detect snakes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that deals with such little chaotic </v>

201
00:13:45.701 --> 00:13:46.534
<v Speaker 1>piles of undone business and the more of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those that are around you </v>

202
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:50.913
<v Speaker 1>psychologically or physically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more negative emotions you </v>

203
00:13:53.681 --> 00:13:54.514
<v Speaker 1>experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last hope you experienced and the </v>

204
00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:57.963
<v Speaker 1>larger your stress response chronically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not good because if your </v>

205
00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:02.373
<v Speaker 1>stress response is chronically elevated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that suppresses your immune logical </v>

206
00:14:05.861 --> 00:14:07.990
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you overweight,</v>

207
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:11.950
<v Speaker 1>predisposes you to diabetes and cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you age faster.</v>

208
00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:15.670
<v Speaker 1>It increases the probability that you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>have anxiety disorders and depression.</v>

209
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

210
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:24.130
<v Speaker 1>so clarifying who you are and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing is a good thing.</v>

211
00:14:24.131 --> 00:14:26.110
<v Speaker 1>Unless you want all those other things </v>
<v Speaker 1>to happen,</v>

212
00:14:26.111 --> 00:14:31.111
<v Speaker 1>which seems highly improbable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although people desire some very strange</v>

213
00:14:31.391 --> 00:14:36.391
<v Speaker 1>things and that's part of what we'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about as this course progresses.</v>

214
00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:38.223
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you want to find out about the </v>

215
00:14:40.991 --> 00:14:44.470
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go to Jordan b Peterson Dotcom,</v>

216
00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:46.023
<v Speaker 1>and the courses are listed there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just type my name into a search </v>

217
00:14:47.891 --> 00:14:51.860
<v Speaker 1>engine and you'll find the courses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This course is psych two to 30.</v>

218
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.220
<v Speaker 1>Obviously I mentioned if there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading book,</v>

219
00:14:55.221 --> 00:14:58.130
<v Speaker 1>would you have to buy the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>readings are online,</v>

220
00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.060
<v Speaker 1>the order that you do that reading is </v>
<v Speaker 1>listed on the syllabus.</v>

221
00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:06.170
<v Speaker 1>You also have to do two assignments and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the essay,</v>

222
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.093
<v Speaker 1>which is only 750 words by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't let that fool you because the </v>

223
00:15:10.101 --> 00:15:12.800
<v Speaker 1>750 word essay can be very difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 1>write</v>

224
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.520
<v Speaker 1>the essay and then this personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>

225
00:15:16.521 --> 00:15:17.354
<v Speaker 1>Now the personality analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is show it to the Ta </v>

226
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:22.963
<v Speaker 1>to show them that you completed it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we don't want to know what you </v>

227
00:15:25.311 --> 00:15:26.144
<v Speaker 1>wrote down and we want to encourage you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to write down things that you know that </v>

228
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.970
<v Speaker 1>you'd like to write down that are likely</v>
<v Speaker 1>private,</v>

229
00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.430
<v Speaker 1>unless you want to broadcast to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>faults on facebook,</v>

230
00:15:34.431 --> 00:15:37.490
<v Speaker 1>which I suppose you knew after you </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete the exercise.</v>

231
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:40.820
<v Speaker 1>So the reason I want you to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

232
00:15:40.821 --> 00:15:41.840
<v Speaker 1>there's three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

233
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:42.703
<v Speaker 1>One is well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will familiarize you more with </v>

234
00:15:44.871 --> 00:15:45.704
<v Speaker 1>standard models of personality because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to apply them to yourself and </v>

235
00:15:48.081 --> 00:15:50.030
<v Speaker 1>so then you'll understand yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>better too.</v>

236
00:15:50.031 --> 00:15:50.864
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's also a clinical </v>

237
00:15:54.561 --> 00:15:57.380
<v Speaker 1>intervention and some of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're in this course,</v>

238
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:58.303
<v Speaker 1>are no doubt interested in clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology and so this will give you a </v>

239
00:16:00.441 --> 00:16:01.274
<v Speaker 1>flavor of the sorts of things that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical psychologist might do except a </v>

240
00:16:05.211 --> 00:16:08.870
<v Speaker 1>computer is doing it and then which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which turns out to be fine.</v>

241
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:13.070
<v Speaker 1>People will actually often tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>computers things that they wouldn't tell</v>

242
00:16:13.071 --> 00:16:16.340
<v Speaker 1>people because the computer doesn't care</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you've done particularly,</v>

243
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:18.950
<v Speaker 1>not yet anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

244
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:23.510
<v Speaker 1>the third reason is that while it should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be good for you and you know,</v>

245
00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.310
<v Speaker 1>education should be good for you.</v>

246
00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.560
<v Speaker 1>That's actually the purpose of </v>
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>

247
00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.473
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to make you more healthy </v>

248
00:16:30.171 --> 00:16:31.004
<v Speaker 1>mentally and physically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to make you more </v>

249
00:16:32.631 --> 00:16:33.464
<v Speaker 1>productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what education is for and </v>

250
00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:39.260
<v Speaker 1>that's what this class is for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what we're aiming at.</v>

251
00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:43.160
<v Speaker 1>So then there's two exams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two midterms,</v>

252
00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.610
<v Speaker 1>25 percent each.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Approximately there are multiple choice.</v>

253
00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:48.003
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll post sample questions so that </v>

254
00:16:50.601 --> 00:16:53.810
<v Speaker 1>you'll know what they're like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not tricky.</v>

255
00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.630
<v Speaker 1>People get worried about exams and </v>
<v Speaker 1>rightly so,</v>

256
00:16:56.631 --> 00:16:57.464
<v Speaker 1>but these aren't tricky dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do the readings and you come to </v>

257
00:16:59.781 --> 00:17:01.940
<v Speaker 1>the class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probabilities quite high that you'll</v>

258
00:17:01.941 --> 00:17:05.130
<v Speaker 1>do at least reasonably well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

259
00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't ask you to memorize dates and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing.</v>

260
00:17:08.211 --> 00:17:09.044
<v Speaker 1>I try to keep it at a conceptual level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the questions on the multiple </v>

261
00:17:11.841 --> 00:17:16.310
<v Speaker 1>choice tests are usually conceptual </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions where I try to get you to take</v>

262
00:17:16.311 --> 00:17:17.144
<v Speaker 1>something that you've learned to read </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to apply it to the solving of a </v>

263
00:17:19.911 --> 00:17:21.950
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they're in standard multiple</v>

264
00:17:21.951 --> 00:17:23.450
<v Speaker 1>choice format,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

265
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.240
<v Speaker 1>there's usually not a tremendous number </v>
<v Speaker 1>of questions.</v>

266
00:17:26.241 --> 00:17:31.241
<v Speaker 1>So you'll be able to complete the exams </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the time allowed without any trouble.</v>

267
00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:34.880
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>now let's see.</v>

268
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:35.803
<v Speaker 1>I should tell you guys who should take </v>
<v Speaker 1>this course and who shouldn't take it </v>

269
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.140
<v Speaker 1>because you need to know that since it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>your first day.</v>

270
00:17:42.141 --> 00:17:47.141
<v Speaker 1>And so this course has two or three </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects.</v>

271
00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:52.770
<v Speaker 1>One aspect is scientific that really </v>
<v Speaker 1>occupies the last half of the course,</v>

272
00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:57.090
<v Speaker 1>I would say it in the pre scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the course</v>

273
00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:02.120
<v Speaker 1>with a purely research oriented element </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the course.</v>

274
00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:06.080
<v Speaker 1>The first part of scientific too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because science has more science,</v>

275
00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:09.000
<v Speaker 1>more than mere testing of hypotheses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

276
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:10.133
<v Speaker 1>the second half of the course deals </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially with trait theory with </v>

277
00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:14.703
<v Speaker 1>psychobiology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I want to do is to tell you </v>

278
00:18:16.801 --> 00:18:17.634
<v Speaker 1>about the basic dimensions of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>variability and also how those are </v>

279
00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:24.683
<v Speaker 1>represented in the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that you can make a connection and </v>

280
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:28.463
<v Speaker 1>the body so that you can make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection between the theories and the </v>

281
00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:36.660
<v Speaker 1>biological cognitive subscripts and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a unifying attempt.</v>

282
00:18:36.661 --> 00:18:37.494
<v Speaker 1>So you bought to be interested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not if you want to take this course and </v>

283
00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how did it go well for you.</v>

284
00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:44.573
<v Speaker 1>So there's some psychometrics that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>science of measurement because a little </v>

285
00:18:47.551 --> 00:18:48.384
<v Speaker 1>bit of statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a reasonable amount of </v>

286
00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.760
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychology and some of it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex,</v>

287
00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:58.790
<v Speaker 1>some of it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I try to only pick things that I try</v>

288
00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:02.223
<v Speaker 1>to only pick things to discuss with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are relevant at three levels of </v>

289
00:19:04.651 --> 00:19:07.590
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want them to be personally relevant so</v>

290
00:19:07.591 --> 00:19:09.330
<v Speaker 1>that they tell you something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

291
00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.000
<v Speaker 1>I want them to be intellectually </v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant,</v>

292
00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:15.550
<v Speaker 1>but I also want them to be culturally </v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant so that not all.</v>

293
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.900
<v Speaker 1>When you walk away from the study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only have,</v>

294
00:19:17.901 --> 00:19:19.980
<v Speaker 1>you know something more about you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your friends,</v>

295
00:19:19.981 --> 00:19:20.814
<v Speaker 1>but hopefully you're a better </v>
<v Speaker 1>functioning creature in the broader </v>

296
00:19:23.221 --> 00:19:24.240
<v Speaker 1>social meal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

297
00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:28.640
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so everything is picked to that end,</v>

298
00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:29.493
<v Speaker 1>including the psychobiological or </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychological material and the </v>

299
00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:35.690
<v Speaker 1>trait material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a fairly heavy,</v>

300
00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:37.290
<v Speaker 1>heavy emphasis on</v>

301
00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:40.203
<v Speaker 1>clinical issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first half of the course deals with </v>

302
00:19:43.571 --> 00:19:44.404
<v Speaker 1>classic theorists have personality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the classic personality theorists </v>

303
00:19:48.011 --> 00:19:50.740
<v Speaker 1>were clinicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the UFT at present,</v>

304
00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:51.883
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have a clinical program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they're starting to get up in </v>

305
00:19:54.101 --> 00:19:56.260
<v Speaker 1>scarborough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but down here at St George,</v>

306
00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:59.230
<v Speaker 1>there's not many clinicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm probably the only one.</v>

307
00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:04.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why they let me in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we did and the thing,</v>

308
00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:07.780
<v Speaker 1>the emphasis on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the emphasis of clinicians,</v>

309
00:20:07.781 --> 00:20:08.800
<v Speaker 1>it's twofold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

310
00:20:08.801 --> 00:20:09.634
<v Speaker 1>One is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well who is the person or what is the </v>

311
00:20:12.041 --> 00:20:13.480
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly,</v>

312
00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:17.620
<v Speaker 1>who could the person be or what should </v>
<v Speaker 1>they be?</v>

313
00:20:17.621 --> 00:20:19.930
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very strange thing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

314
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:21.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you have a cat,</v>

315
00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:25.060
<v Speaker 1>you don't really sit around thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>what could this cap b?</v>

316
00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.340
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a captain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

317
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:28.263
<v Speaker 1>if it has offspring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there going to be cats and in the past </v>

318
00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.320
<v Speaker 1>years there's still going to be just </v>
<v Speaker 1>cats.</v>

319
00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:34.960
<v Speaker 1>But people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

320
00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:40.020
<v Speaker 1>we're strange in ways that are virtually</v>
<v Speaker 1>incomprehensible and we're not only what</v>

321
00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:41.433
<v Speaker 1>we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're also what we could be and in </v>

322
00:20:43.901 --> 00:20:46.540
<v Speaker 1>many cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially for people of your age,</v>

323
00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:51.340
<v Speaker 1>you're way more what you could be than </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you are and so focusing on what you</v>

324
00:20:51.341 --> 00:20:54.340
<v Speaker 1>could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it an extremely important thing to do</v>

325
00:20:54.341 --> 00:20:55.174
<v Speaker 1>and in fact there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of research and some of </v>

326
00:20:57.011 --> 00:21:01.540
<v Speaker 1>it's associated with the writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>exercises that I told you about earlier,</v>

327
00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:02.523
<v Speaker 1>that if you make efforts to define who </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be and you know in a way that </v>

328
00:21:07.061 --> 00:21:07.894
<v Speaker 1>you find interesting because he might as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well shape yourself into something that </v>

329
00:21:10.271 --> 00:21:11.104
<v Speaker 1>you want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that increases the efficiency with </v>

330
00:21:14.111 --> 00:21:14.944
<v Speaker 1>which you work substantially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also makes you a better person by </v>

331
00:21:19.181 --> 00:21:21.310
<v Speaker 1>reasonable measures of better sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs,</v>

332
00:21:21.311 --> 00:21:25.990
<v Speaker 1>happier and healthier and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptable or at least less repulsive to</v>

333
00:21:25.991 --> 00:21:26.824
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

334
00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:28.683
<v Speaker 1>So the clinical materials very useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that and the clinical material is </v>

335
00:21:33.581 --> 00:21:37.000
<v Speaker 1>grounded in observation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of like ethos elegy.</v>

336
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.460
<v Speaker 1>He thought Ology is the study of animal </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>

337
00:21:39.461 --> 00:21:41.670
<v Speaker 1>but no one in the lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's observational study,</v>

338
00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:45.640
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the clinical stuff has this </v>
<v Speaker 1>observational quality to it.</v>

339
00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:50.470
<v Speaker 1>It's heavily influenced by philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're not interested in ideas,</v>

340
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.120
<v Speaker 1>this is a bad course for you because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

341
00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.073
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a course that private equity </v>

342
00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:56.373
<v Speaker 1>concentrates on ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want them to have practical utility </v>

343
00:21:59.531 --> 00:22:00.910
<v Speaker 1>because why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want us?</v>

344
00:22:00.911 --> 00:22:02.230
<v Speaker 1>We'll put constraints on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

345
00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:03.743
<v Speaker 1>but the fundamental focus is ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when we discuss the clinical </v>

346
00:22:08.201 --> 00:22:11.170
<v Speaker 1>material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical personality material,</v>

347
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:14.380
<v Speaker 1>we'll discuss the philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 1>background of that and we'll do the same</v>

348
00:22:14.381 --> 00:22:17.290
<v Speaker 1>thing when we get to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychobiological material.</v>

349
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:18.303
<v Speaker 1>So you want to decide if you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in philosophical ideas that </v>

350
00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.750
<v Speaker 1>this is a bad course because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be stuck with,</v>

351
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:28.000
<v Speaker 1>with those sorts of things half the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

352
00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:29.433
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

353
00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.600
<v Speaker 1>And there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some elements of the course.</v>

354
00:22:34.601 --> 00:22:37.890
<v Speaker 1>They're almost straight philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 1>because some of the clinical schools,</v>

355
00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:40.360
<v Speaker 1>especially those that were developed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>19 fifties,</v>

356
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:42.093
<v Speaker 1>like existential psychology are very </v>
<v Speaker 1>tightly associated with fields of </v>

357
00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:49.450
<v Speaker 1>philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>existentialism and phenomenology in that</v>

358
00:22:49.451 --> 00:22:50.290
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

359
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:51.423
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that sort of thing is very much </v>

360
00:22:53.321 --> 00:22:54.154
<v Speaker 1>worth learning because it's part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>history of ideas and you should also </v>

361
00:22:57.011 --> 00:22:59.830
<v Speaker 1>think about it and it's also very </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

362
00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:00.933
<v Speaker 1>It's very useful to know something about</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to be a clinical </v>

363
00:23:02.621 --> 00:23:04.670
<v Speaker 1>psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you should know a fair bit about</v>

364
00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:07.000
<v Speaker 1>a lot of things if you're going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical psychologist.</v>

365
00:23:07.001 --> 00:23:10.730
<v Speaker 1>But even if you're interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>research sciences,</v>

366
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:11.583
<v Speaker 1>have high hypothesis testing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the other half is I bought this </v>

367
00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.190
<v Speaker 1>generation that's the most important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After.</v>

368
00:23:17.191 --> 00:23:19.720
<v Speaker 1>You've got to think up an idea before </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can test it.</v>

369
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:20.943
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of what you'll learn in methods </v>

370
00:23:22.241 --> 00:23:25.270
<v Speaker 1>class has nothing to do with gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>research hypotheses.</v>

371
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:29.140
<v Speaker 1>They just tell you to do that first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generate your research hypotheses.</v>

372
00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:30.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

373
00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:34.390
<v Speaker 1>that's the big problem right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The resident is just machinery,</v>

374
00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:35.253
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll just grind it through this </v>

375
00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:37.023
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way you generate research </v>

376
00:23:39.491 --> 00:23:40.324
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis is by knowing something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to learn a lot in order </v>

377
00:23:44.621 --> 00:23:47.330
<v Speaker 1>to generate a research hypothesis that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well first,</v>

378
00:23:47.331 --> 00:23:51.980
<v Speaker 1>if someone hasn't already else hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>already thought of and disproved,</v>

379
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:54.740
<v Speaker 1>which is highly probable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually depressing.</v>

380
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:57.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But more and more knowledge because what</v>

381
00:23:57.501 --> 00:24:00.230
<v Speaker 1>you find is that everyone's already </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought of everything.</v>

382
00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:04.410
<v Speaker 1>And what was your ideas are stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

383
00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:06.920
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

384
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:12.320
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now let's see.</v>

385
00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:13.243
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's another reason not to take the </v>

386
00:24:14.511 --> 00:24:15.344
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of reading and there's </v>

387
00:24:19.101 --> 00:24:24.020
<v Speaker 1>less reading either was last year I took</v>
<v Speaker 1>out one paper that was too hard.</v>

388
00:24:24.021 --> 00:24:29.021
<v Speaker 1>I think it was too hard for people even </v>
<v Speaker 1>though it was a great paper and left the</v>

389
00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:30.670
<v Speaker 1>rest of the data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

390
00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:33.993
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're looking for a course with a </v>

391
00:24:35.141 --> 00:24:35.974
<v Speaker 1>light reading load,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't that course because this has </v>

392
00:24:38.771 --> 00:24:42.400
<v Speaker 1>a heavy reading load now on the upside </v>
<v Speaker 1>for your essays,</v>

393
00:24:42.401 --> 00:24:44.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't require you to read outside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the course.</v>

394
00:24:44.801 --> 00:24:47.590
<v Speaker 1>You can use the material that's in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>course to write the essay.</v>

395
00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:50.260
<v Speaker 1>So it's self contained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

396
00:24:50.261 --> 00:24:55.261
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of reading and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>easy reading and partly because a lot of</v>

397
00:24:56.591 --> 00:24:57.424
<v Speaker 1>it is original papers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the stuff that's listed on the web </v>

398
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:03.790
<v Speaker 1>is original papers and then the textbook</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

399
00:25:03.791 --> 00:25:06.040
<v Speaker 1>It's tough textbook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's mostly text,</v>

400
00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:08.163
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have a lot of pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has no stories at all about </v>

401
00:25:10.211 --> 00:25:12.720
<v Speaker 1>celebrities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the only text left.</v>

402
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.150
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't have stories about celebrities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

403
00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:21.460
<v Speaker 1>if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're taking a tough course semester</v>

404
00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:23.950
<v Speaker 1>and you don't have a lot of time to </v>
<v Speaker 1>read,</v>

405
00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:29.550
<v Speaker 1>then well this isn't a course like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a course where there's an awful lot</v>

406
00:25:30.851 --> 00:25:34.840
<v Speaker 1>to read and the thing about the reading </v>
<v Speaker 1>too is that you have to think about it.</v>

407
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:36.183
<v Speaker 1>You know like how fast you can read </v>
<v Speaker 1>something seems to be a function of how </v>

408
00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.770
<v Speaker 1>complicated the words are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be function one,</v>

409
00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:45.753
<v Speaker 1>but the second function seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like how many ideas and there </v>

410
00:25:48.491 --> 00:25:53.491
<v Speaker 1>are per paragraph or maybe per paid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are lots of ideas per paragraph in</v>

411
00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:55.630
<v Speaker 1>these readings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I picked them.</v>

412
00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:59.020
<v Speaker 1>So you can't just zip through them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to think about,</v>

413
00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:02.020
<v Speaker 1>well that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do read them,</v>

414
00:26:02.021 --> 00:26:02.854
<v Speaker 1>you'll know a lot more at the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>class than you did at the beginning of </v>

415
00:26:05.051 --> 00:26:08.320
<v Speaker 1>the class and you'll find that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge is extremely useful.</v>

416
00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:11.770
<v Speaker 1>I truly believe that this knowledge can </v>
<v Speaker 1>change your life.</v>

417
00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:13.570
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was generated for it,</v>

418
00:26:13.571 --> 00:26:14.404
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's generated by clinicians and </v>

419
00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:16.693
<v Speaker 1>personality psychologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're out there to do and </v>

420
00:26:19.511 --> 00:26:23.560
<v Speaker 1>they're all fair to take revealed </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>

421
00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:24.813
<v Speaker 1>It could be anything and to hammer it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and shape it into something that's hard </v>

422
00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:29.643
<v Speaker 1>and pure and solid and you have to do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of reading and writing that faking </v>

423
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:36.663
<v Speaker 1>to get to a point like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it really beats the hell out of </v>

424
00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:40.983
<v Speaker 1>mucking about in the murk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately that's how many people </v>

425
00:26:45.271 --> 00:26:47.730
<v Speaker 1>live and I've seen the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

426
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.850
<v Speaker 1>And if you spend the next 30 years like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

427
00:26:50.851 --> 00:26:55.740
<v Speaker 1>you will be old by the time you're 50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I would recommend that.</v>

428
00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:59.670
<v Speaker 1>So it's worth doing the work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really worth.</v>

429
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:05.250
<v Speaker 1>So let's take a look now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well first I'll ask you if there are any</v>

430
00:27:05.251 --> 00:27:09.130
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any questions?</v>

431
00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:13.680
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

432
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:16.650
<v Speaker 1>I'll get the user name and passwords up </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you pretty quick,</v>

433
00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:22.220
<v Speaker 1>so I just have to make contact with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy designed it was to get the code,</v>

434
00:27:22.601 --> 00:27:23.820
<v Speaker 1>so won't be long.</v>

435
00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:26.920
<v Speaker 2>Can you find?</v>

436
00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:32.290
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the plan.</v>

437
00:27:32.291 --> 00:27:35.050
<v Speaker 1>Some of you have purchased it perhaps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

438
00:27:35.051 --> 00:27:35.884
<v Speaker 1>so it appears that you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also maybe some old texts from </v>

439
00:27:38.711 --> 00:27:41.720
<v Speaker 1>right slack floating about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can use those to do.</v>

440
00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:42.563
<v Speaker 1>You can get a good deal on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can often get them second hand on </v>

441
00:27:44.561 --> 00:27:46.630
<v Speaker 1>Amazon for like 20 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look,</v>

442
00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:50.950
<v Speaker 1>the old text is fine except that it has </v>
<v Speaker 1>more chapters in it,</v>

443
00:27:50.951 --> 00:27:54.010
<v Speaker 1>but if you pay attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>careful attention to the syllabus,</v>

444
00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.113
<v Speaker 1>that won't be a problem because all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chapters are numbered and all you have </v>

445
00:27:56.771 --> 00:28:00.040
<v Speaker 1>to do is match the number on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>syllabus to the number in the book.</v>

446
00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:05.460
<v Speaker 1>So other questions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

447
00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:11.440
<v Speaker 1>so let's take a look at what we're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to learn about</v>

448
00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:14.110
<v Speaker 1>lecture too.</v>

449
00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:17.740
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

450
00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:19.023
<v Speaker 1>So you can think of human knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some ways it was branching into two </v>

451
00:28:23.831 --> 00:28:24.664
<v Speaker 1>components.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can take them to those two </v>

452
00:28:26.861 --> 00:28:30.730
<v Speaker 1>components as knowledge about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject of world and knowledge about the</v>

453
00:28:30.731 --> 00:28:33.220
<v Speaker 1>objective world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

454
00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:35.283
<v Speaker 1>The other way you could think about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is knowledge about what things are and </v>

455
00:28:38.851 --> 00:28:41.740
<v Speaker 1>knowledge about what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

456
00:28:41.741 --> 00:28:45.160
<v Speaker 1>Most of what you learn in university is </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge about what things are,</v>

457
00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:46.623
<v Speaker 1>but that's only half of what you need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>know because you really need to know </v>

458
00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:50.923
<v Speaker 1>what you should go about and do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a real problem for human beings </v>

459
00:28:54.821 --> 00:28:55.654
<v Speaker 1>because we're always trying to having to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think up what we should be doing next </v>

460
00:28:58.061 --> 00:29:00.490
<v Speaker 1>and like that's the fundamental question</v>
<v Speaker 1>of life,</v>

461
00:29:00.491 --> 00:29:01.270
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

462
00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:04.120
<v Speaker 1>what should I do next?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or what should I do tomorrow?</v>

463
00:29:04.121 --> 00:29:07.060
<v Speaker 1>Or what should I do next week or next </v>
<v Speaker 1>month or next year?</v>

464
00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:07.893
<v Speaker 1>Because that's another problem about </v>
<v Speaker 1>being human is that not only do we have </v>

465
00:29:10.331 --> 00:29:11.164
<v Speaker 1>to figure out what to do next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can also see the future or </v>

466
00:29:14.591 --> 00:29:17.580
<v Speaker 1>multiple futures even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we have to determine what those</v>

467
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:18.463
<v Speaker 1>futures could be and how to avoid others</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we don't want to have come into </v>

468
00:29:21.911 --> 00:29:22.744
<v Speaker 1>existence at all and then how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>configure our behaviors so that as we </v>

469
00:29:25.691 --> 00:29:26.524
<v Speaker 1>navigate through the potential futures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we land up more or less somewhere we </v>

470
00:29:30.071 --> 00:29:32.350
<v Speaker 1>want and not somewhere we really don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>

471
00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:36.490
<v Speaker 1>and so that's a real problem and one </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an existential problem in fact,</v>

472
00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:41.500
<v Speaker 1>and what that means is that we need </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge about the subjective and about</v>

473
00:29:41.981 --> 00:29:45.580
<v Speaker 1>the behavioral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part of potential.</v>

474
00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:50.140
<v Speaker 1>How do you unravel yourself across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's proved very difficult for human</v>

475
00:29:50.141 --> 00:29:52.900
<v Speaker 1>beings to formalize that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>

476
00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.313
<v Speaker 1>Now we formalized scientific knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>which has more knowledge about what </v>

477
00:29:56.531 --> 00:29:59.110
<v Speaker 1>things are and about the objective </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

478
00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.200
<v Speaker 1>the scientific method,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the research method,</v>

479
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:06.550
<v Speaker 1>formalizes or knowledge about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective world and about what it's made</v>

480
00:30:06.551 --> 00:30:09.400
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't give us much insight into</v>

481
00:30:09.401 --> 00:30:11.380
<v Speaker 1>what to do about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All.</v>

482
00:30:11.381 --> 00:30:12.214
<v Speaker 1>It seems to do actually is increase our </v>
<v Speaker 1>power to do things but not necessarily </v>

483
00:30:15.821 --> 00:30:16.654
<v Speaker 1>to inform us as to the direction in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which that power should be exerted and </v>

484
00:30:20.621 --> 00:30:21.454
<v Speaker 1>you don't really have to look any </v>
<v Speaker 1>farther than the 20th century if you </v>

485
00:30:24.221 --> 00:30:25.054
<v Speaker 1>want historical proof of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because as people got more and more </v>

486
00:30:27.641 --> 00:30:28.474
<v Speaker 1>powerful so that we could sit in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>lovely classroom and all be warm and </v>

487
00:30:31.271 --> 00:30:33.040
<v Speaker 1>cozy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while it's terrible outside,</v>

488
00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:36.190
<v Speaker 1>we also learned how to kill each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>with unprecedented</v>

489
00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:39.883
<v Speaker 1>Gusto and potency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so science has enabled us on both </v>

490
00:30:43.911 --> 00:30:47.330
<v Speaker 1>sides and that's how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good or bad.</v>

491
00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:49.953
<v Speaker 1>On the behavioral side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a tradition of knowledge and </v>

492
00:30:53.561 --> 00:30:54.394
<v Speaker 1>it's an ancient tradition and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>grounded in forms of knowledge that are </v>

493
00:30:58.271 --> 00:31:02.800
<v Speaker 1>likely tens of thousands of years old or</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even older than that.</v>

494
00:31:02.801 --> 00:31:03.634
<v Speaker 1>And those are forms of knowledge that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are essentially mythological for </v>

495
00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:06.843
<v Speaker 1>religious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that I start with those </v>

496
00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:10.870
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

497
00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:15.670
<v Speaker 1>religious systems are in many ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories of personality.</v>

498
00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:17.133
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's very tight associations </v>

499
00:31:18.761 --> 00:31:22.420
<v Speaker 1>between certain religions and certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>fields of psychology.</v>

500
00:31:22.421 --> 00:31:27.400
<v Speaker 1>So Judaism that's been identified fairly</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavily with Freud and Christianity with</v>

501
00:31:27.401 --> 00:31:29.720
<v Speaker 1>Carl Jung's work and also with Carl </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogers,</v>

502
00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:30.843
<v Speaker 1>Rogers was actually a seminarian and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of the ideas about what a person </v>

503
00:31:35.051 --> 00:31:35.884
<v Speaker 1>could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are ideas about the ideal are </v>

504
00:31:38.621 --> 00:31:39.454
<v Speaker 1>derived from religious and mythological </v>
<v Speaker 1>substrates because they have to be </v>

505
00:31:42.581 --> 00:31:45.060
<v Speaker 1>derived from somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

506
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.851
<v Speaker 1>And so you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

507
00:31:45.851 --> 00:31:49.570
<v Speaker 1>how do people get their ideas about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's possible or what should be.</v>

508
00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:52.420
<v Speaker 1>Part of it is through storytelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you go to movies,</v>

509
00:31:52.421 --> 00:31:54.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go there to see what people could be</v>

510
00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:55.773
<v Speaker 1>and you enact all those people on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>screen with your bodies while it's </v>

511
00:31:58.721 --> 00:32:01.630
<v Speaker 1>happening and you have a little neuro </v>
<v Speaker 1>system that does that.</v>

512
00:32:01.631 --> 00:32:05.020
<v Speaker 1>So it puts you right in the action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing ability,</v>

513
00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.273
<v Speaker 1>amazing human ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason we're so attracted to </v>

514
00:32:08.771 --> 00:32:09.604
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing is because we want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what to do with ourselves and </v>

515
00:32:12.131 --> 00:32:12.964
<v Speaker 1>there's a very large body of very </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex information that pertains to </v>

516
00:32:16.541 --> 00:32:17.374
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that Carl young set </v>

517
00:32:19.181 --> 00:32:20.014
<v Speaker 1>was that one of the things he believed </v>
<v Speaker 1>was that that form of knowledge have </v>

518
00:32:24.131 --> 00:32:28.480
<v Speaker 1>developed quite explicitly up to about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time of the renaissance or a boat at</v>

519
00:32:28.481 --> 00:32:32.070
<v Speaker 1>the time of the Bacon and descartes who </v>
<v Speaker 1>founded and Galileo,</v>

520
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:33.063
<v Speaker 1>who basically found the scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>method and then we sort of stopped </v>

521
00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:36.413
<v Speaker 1>developing that kind of knowledge and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the knowledge of the objective world </v>

522
00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:39.973
<v Speaker 1>leapt ahead and in like exponentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's left us with the same </v>

523
00:32:44.541 --> 00:32:46.980
<v Speaker 1>moral intelligence we have in the 17 </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds,</v>

524
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.230
<v Speaker 1>but with 21st century technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily a good thing.</v>

525
00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:55.910
<v Speaker 1>So part of what we're doing in a sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>is rescuing the past.</v>

526
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:57.463
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my other class sometimes I show </v>

527
00:32:59.061 --> 00:33:01.820
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you Seen Pinocchio?</v>

528
00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:03.980
<v Speaker 1>I launched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

529
00:33:03.981 --> 00:33:04.814
<v Speaker 1>it's like the most popular animated </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie ever made seconds I think is the </v>

530
00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:08.993
<v Speaker 1>line more partner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one saving for Nokia where </v>

531
00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:14.570
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio rescues is farther from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whale.</v>

532
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:18.080
<v Speaker 1>You may remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may notice that you watched that and</v>

533
00:33:18.081 --> 00:33:18.914
<v Speaker 1>that was perfectly fine as far as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were concerned that you could watch on </v>

534
00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:22.463
<v Speaker 1>puppet swim with a cricket to the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the ocean and rescue his father from </v>

535
00:33:26.871 --> 00:33:28.260
<v Speaker 1>a whale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

536
00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:31.370
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the first thing you might think about</v>

537
00:33:31.371 --> 00:33:35.590
<v Speaker 1>is how in the world could you sit there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and swallow that and not even notice.</v>

538
00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:36.523
<v Speaker 1>Notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>notice that you were doing something as </v>

539
00:33:38.181 --> 00:33:39.014
<v Speaker 1>absurd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as bizarre as any ritual you can </v>

540
00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:41.413
<v Speaker 1>possibly imagine while it's partly </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're very attracted to </v>

541
00:33:44.931 --> 00:33:45.764
<v Speaker 1>narrative and narrative's have </v>
<v Speaker 1>structured narrative through both </v>

542
00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:52.790
<v Speaker 1>behavior and they have a deep structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have a deep symbolic structure.</v>

543
00:33:52.791 --> 00:33:53.624
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whale in Pinocchio wasn't just any </v>

544
00:33:56.421 --> 00:33:59.510
<v Speaker 1>ordinary whale because if you remember </v>
<v Speaker 1>it also breathe,</v>

545
00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:00.373
<v Speaker 1>smoke and fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange behavior for a whale </v>

546
00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:08.640
<v Speaker 1>and not make even a window that strange </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that made it a dragon and so part of</v>

547
00:34:09.891 --> 00:34:13.010
<v Speaker 1>what that meant was the Pinocchio was </v>
<v Speaker 1>rescuing as far as from a dragon.</v>

548
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:15.560
<v Speaker 1>That's a very old story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

549
00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:19.220
<v Speaker 1>that story is the oldest story that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have in written form.</v>

550
00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:20.293
<v Speaker 1>It's a variant of a story that was told </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the Mesopotamians pump 5,000 years </v>

551
00:34:23.361 --> 00:34:24.800
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

552
00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:30.580
<v Speaker 1>part of that story means when you should</v>
<v Speaker 1>rescue your father from what?</v>

553
00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:31.773
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the murky chaos in which your </v>

554
00:34:33.161 --> 00:34:34.770
<v Speaker 1>culture is embedded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

555
00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:39.470
<v Speaker 1>you guys are all inheritors of rich </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural traditions.</v>

556
00:34:39.471 --> 00:34:43.960
<v Speaker 1>You know those aren't just words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those cultural traditions orient you.</v>

557
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:47.500
<v Speaker 1>They keep you sane and if they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>desiccated,</v>

558
00:34:47.501 --> 00:34:49.810
<v Speaker 1>the broken up and dad in archaic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in line,</v>

559
00:34:49.811 --> 00:34:50.644
<v Speaker 1>in the bottom of the chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you better get them back out of </v>

560
00:34:53.561 --> 00:34:54.394
<v Speaker 1>there because without them you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to live shadow and difficult lives and </v>

561
00:34:57.911 --> 00:34:58.744
<v Speaker 1>that's a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So starting with the historical </v>

562
00:35:02.501 --> 00:35:03.334
<v Speaker 1>perspectives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can situate ourselves in maybe some </v>

563
00:35:06.311 --> 00:35:08.620
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of thousands of years of </v>
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

564
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:09.543
<v Speaker 1>maybe even longer on I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you in one manner might be </v>

565
00:35:12.911 --> 00:35:13.744
<v Speaker 1>longer.</v>

566
00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:16.953
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that part of the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can see so well with which we </v>

567
00:35:20.621 --> 00:35:21.454
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings can really see well way </v>

568
00:35:23.501 --> 00:35:26.710
<v Speaker 1>better than almost any other animal </v>
<v Speaker 1>except hunting birds.</v>

569
00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:28.990
<v Speaker 1>Hunting birds can see better than not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but other than not,</v>

570
00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:33.460
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's us and that's especially rare among</v>

571
00:35:33.461 --> 00:35:35.710
<v Speaker 1>mammals in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rare among primates.</v>

572
00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:38.190
<v Speaker 1>So you might yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

573
00:35:38.191 --> 00:35:40.470
<v Speaker 1>why can we see so well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

574
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.333
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that part of the reason is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we call evolved with predatory </v>

575
00:35:44.221 --> 00:35:45.054
<v Speaker 1>snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So predatory snakes are newer than </v>

576
00:35:47.641 --> 00:35:50.010
<v Speaker 1>lizards by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you wouldn't think so.</v>

577
00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.313
<v Speaker 1>Aaron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a woman at Ucla named Lynn </v>

578
00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:55.711
<v Speaker 1>Isabelle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was thinking,</v>

579
00:35:55.711 --> 00:35:57.810
<v Speaker 1>why do people see so well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so she went.</v>

580
00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.900
<v Speaker 1>She had the snake detection theory </v>
<v Speaker 1>because she'd worked with primates.</v>

581
00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:05.010
<v Speaker 1>She knew they could really see the sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of camouflage patterns that snake hats,</v>

582
00:36:05.011 --> 00:36:05.520
<v Speaker 1>name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tab,</v>

583
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:06.600
<v Speaker 1>and the motion that they make.</v>

584
00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:07.433
<v Speaker 1>They're really good at detecting now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus human beings are very afraid of </v>

585
00:36:09.481 --> 00:36:11.670
<v Speaker 1>snakes innately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus,</v>

586
00:36:11.671 --> 00:36:12.504
<v Speaker 1>if you date chimpanzees who've never </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen a snake and you throw a rubber </v>

587
00:36:15.391 --> 00:36:17.580
<v Speaker 1>snake in their cage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming they're in a cage,</v>

588
00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:21.360
<v Speaker 1>then they jumped to the top of the cage </v>
<v Speaker 1>and because they're not happy about that</v>

589
00:36:21.361 --> 00:36:22.194
<v Speaker 1>snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they look at it and then if </v>

590
00:36:23.311 --> 00:36:27.330
<v Speaker 1>they're out in the jungle juggling </v>
<v Speaker 1>around and they see a baby snake,</v>

591
00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:28.723
<v Speaker 1>then they have a specific sort of pride </v>
<v Speaker 1>they make and they'll stand there for </v>

592
00:36:31.351 --> 00:36:32.184
<v Speaker 1>like nine hours watching a big snake </v>
<v Speaker 1>making this noise and all the other </v>

593
00:36:35.941 --> 00:36:39.300
<v Speaker 1>chimps depending on how afraid they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also come and look at the snake.</v>

594
00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:40.793
<v Speaker 1>And so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they want to know what that </v>

595
00:36:42.931 --> 00:36:45.090
<v Speaker 1>sneaks up to you and that's what we want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know too.</v>

596
00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.680
<v Speaker 1>We want to know what the snakes are up </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

597
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:47.543
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the circuit that we developed to </v>

598
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:51.833
<v Speaker 1>detect snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The visual circuit is partly what gives </v>

599
00:36:53.641 --> 00:36:57.120
<v Speaker 1>us such tremendous acuity of vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And partly the way Isabelle figured that</v>

600
00:36:57.121 --> 00:36:57.954
<v Speaker 1>out was by correlating primate visual </v>
<v Speaker 1>acuity with the press and its </v>

601
00:37:01.771 --> 00:37:02.604
<v Speaker 1>development over evolutionary time with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the prevalence of predatory snakes in </v>

602
00:37:06.301 --> 00:37:08.850
<v Speaker 1>that geographical region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she found that there was a very high</v>

603
00:37:08.851 --> 00:37:11.070
<v Speaker 1>correlation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we can see sharply,</v>

604
00:37:11.071 --> 00:37:11.904
<v Speaker 1>partly because we're always looking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes and you know that pile of I'm </v>

605
00:37:15.871 --> 00:37:17.850
<v Speaker 1>done homework in your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your,</v>

606
00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:20.940
<v Speaker 1>in your room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's snakes as far as the part of your</v>

607
00:37:20.941 --> 00:37:23.250
<v Speaker 1>brain that developed to deal with snakes</v>
<v Speaker 1>is concerned.</v>

608
00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:24.593
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you leave a lot of things undone </v>

609
00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:28.133
<v Speaker 1>around you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then all you've got snakes and you're </v>

610
00:37:31.231 --> 00:37:34.260
<v Speaker 1>their target and so that's no way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>

611
00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.170
<v Speaker 1>And so that whale down there at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of the ocean,</v>

612
00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.780
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of a very of snake to </v>
<v Speaker 1>dragging,</v>

613
00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:42.480
<v Speaker 1>even though it's a whale breathes fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

614
00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.940
<v Speaker 1>So let's call it the dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

615
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:46.103
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that you have to rescue </v>
<v Speaker 1>something from the drag is an </v>

616
00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:51.990
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably old story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's partly what we're going to</v>

617
00:37:51.991 --> 00:37:53.610
<v Speaker 1>be doing at the beginning of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>

618
00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:54.773
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be going way back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>merch and mark of prehistory trying to </v>

619
00:37:58.951 --> 00:38:03.951
<v Speaker 1>understand what the hell we've been up </v>
<v Speaker 1>to for the last 60 million years because</v>

620
00:38:04.501 --> 00:38:05.334
<v Speaker 1>that's when our tree dwelling ancestors </v>
<v Speaker 1>first really started to deal with </v>

621
00:38:09.301 --> 00:38:10.134
<v Speaker 1>predatory snakes and my suspicions are </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're all evolved from one of </v>

622
00:38:13.921 --> 00:38:14.754
<v Speaker 1>those little tree dwelling rats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first one who figured out that if </v>

623
00:38:17.521 --> 00:38:21.390
<v Speaker 1>you drop the snake stick on a snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would probably run away,</v>

624
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:25.140
<v Speaker 1>so that's what we've been doing for 60 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million years.</v>

625
00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:30.530
<v Speaker 1>Throwing sticks at snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the first lecture and</v>

626
00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:34.793
<v Speaker 1>you'll see why when you do the reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why this is broadly relevant because it </v>

627
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:40.833
<v Speaker 1>also accounts at least in part for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>human tendency to demonize people who </v>

628
00:38:45.281 --> 00:38:46.114
<v Speaker 1>aren't like us because it turns out that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we use the same circuit that we would </v>

629
00:38:49.991 --> 00:38:52.570
<v Speaker 1>use to handle predatory reptiles.</v>

630
00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:55.750
<v Speaker 1>Let's say we use that circuit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first process.</v>

631
00:38:55.751 --> 00:38:56.584
<v Speaker 1>People who are strange to us and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes sense because people who were </v>

632
00:38:59.261 --> 00:39:01.750
<v Speaker 1>strange to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who come from different cultures and who</v>

633
00:39:01.751 --> 00:39:05.920
<v Speaker 1>represent different ideals are </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably dangerous.</v>

634
00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:08.920
<v Speaker 1>Even though they might also be </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably beneficial.</v>

635
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:10.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coordinator of Americans,</v>

636
00:39:10.751 --> 00:39:14.140
<v Speaker 1>they came out and they shook hands with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Europeans and then 95 percent of the</v>

637
00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:15.070
<v Speaker 1>dive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next one,</v>

638
00:39:15.071 --> 00:39:17.140
<v Speaker 1>hundred and 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

639
00:39:17.141 --> 00:39:20.710
<v Speaker 1>They all died in our place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He died of smallpox.</v>

640
00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:22.600
<v Speaker 1>They died of measles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>measles,</v>

641
00:39:22.601 --> 00:39:23.434
<v Speaker 1>just wipe them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the time the pilgrims came to North </v>

642
00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:26.201
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

643
00:39:26.201 --> 00:39:27.034
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly early in North American European </v>

644
00:39:29.621 --> 00:39:30.454
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>95 percent of the Indians were already </v>

645
00:39:32.171 --> 00:39:33.004
<v Speaker 1>dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were welcomed in the Europeans </v>

646
00:39:35.201 --> 00:39:37.660
<v Speaker 1>because they didn't have any people get </v>
<v Speaker 1>their crops off.</v>

647
00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:42.160
<v Speaker 1>So meeting someone who strange is no </v>
<v Speaker 1>trivial thing,</v>

648
00:39:42.161 --> 00:39:44.620
<v Speaker 1>and even if they don't poison me with </v>
<v Speaker 1>some horrible illness,</v>

649
00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:45.573
<v Speaker 1>they'll come along with some cockamamie </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea like Marxism and you'll be Chinese </v>

650
00:39:49.481 --> 00:39:52.780
<v Speaker 1>and then it will be the 20th century in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 100 million of you will die.</v>

651
00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:57.433
<v Speaker 1>It's very useful to understand the deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological structures that we live </v>

652
00:40:01.341 --> 00:40:02.174
<v Speaker 1>inside and their relationship to our </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain and our body really gives you </v>

653
00:40:05.061 --> 00:40:07.820
<v Speaker 1>insight into how people function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's helpful.</v>

654
00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.153
<v Speaker 1>The next lecture is on heroic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shamanic initiations and that brings us </v>

655
00:40:16.401 --> 00:40:19.100
<v Speaker 1>closer to the present than say 60 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million years ago.</v>

656
00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:20.143
<v Speaker 1>It's more like 50,000 years ago and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are shamonic traditions all over </v>

657
00:40:23.601 --> 00:40:24.434
<v Speaker 1>the world and the Shaman is kind of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>precursor to the to the to the to the </v>

658
00:40:30.471 --> 00:40:32.840
<v Speaker 1>man of intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the man of intellect,</v>

659
00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:34.183
<v Speaker 1>the man of culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's sort of a doctor and a </v>

660
00:40:37.371 --> 00:40:42.371
<v Speaker 1>scientist and a priest all wrapped up </v>
<v Speaker 1>into one thing and he's often the person</v>

661
00:40:42.501 --> 00:40:46.670
<v Speaker 1>who's in charge of culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many in many societies,</v>

662
00:40:46.850 --> 00:40:47.683
<v Speaker 1>the Sherman has a vocabulary vocabulary </v>
<v Speaker 1>that vastly exceeds that of his peers </v>

663
00:40:52.641 --> 00:40:53.474
<v Speaker 1>and that's because he's been taught it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in his initiatory process so that the </v>

664
00:40:57.710 --> 00:41:01.910
<v Speaker 1>culture within which that particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>people survives can be</v>

665
00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:06.800
<v Speaker 1>transmitted down the generations with </v>
<v Speaker 1>very little error.</v>

666
00:41:06.801 --> 00:41:09.610
<v Speaker 1>People can remember things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>transmitted verbally.</v>

667
00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.470
<v Speaker 1>It preliterate cultures with </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable accuracy.</v>

668
00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:13.793
<v Speaker 1>Under the shamanic initiation is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest in the heroic initiations as </v>

669
00:41:17.571 --> 00:41:20.270
<v Speaker 1>well are very interesting processes </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they involve.</v>

670
00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:22.303
<v Speaker 1>They involve death and rebirth and death</v>
<v Speaker 1>and rebirth is more or less equivalent </v>

671
00:41:27.561 --> 00:41:29.690
<v Speaker 1>to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's something to think about.</v>

672
00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:34.160
<v Speaker 1>So only if there's a mosquito and wants </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make another mosquito,</v>

673
00:41:34.161 --> 00:41:37.010
<v Speaker 1>it basically lays 10,000 eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

674
00:41:37.011 --> 00:41:37.844
<v Speaker 1>And then all those eggs hatch and 9,999 </v>
<v Speaker 1>of those little mosquitoes die and then </v>

675
00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:46.190
<v Speaker 1>one mosquito makes it and lays another </v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000 days.</v>

676
00:41:46.191 --> 00:41:48.590
<v Speaker 1>So it's pretty costly reproductive </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy,</v>

677
00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:51.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the way the mosquito works is that it</v>

678
00:41:51.891 --> 00:41:52.724
<v Speaker 1>knows that the world is chaotic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous and it has no idea how to </v>

679
00:41:56.541 --> 00:41:57.374
<v Speaker 1>survive in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it just makes a whole pile of </v>

680
00:41:58.851 --> 00:41:59.684
<v Speaker 1>mosquitoes and in hopes that one of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>will sneak through and each of those </v>

681
00:42:02.361 --> 00:42:05.030
<v Speaker 1>mosquitoes is a tiny bit different from </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

682
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:08.480
<v Speaker 1>Mosquito in terms of kind of place and </v>
<v Speaker 1>also genetic structure.</v>

683
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:13.250
<v Speaker 1>And maybe one's got some little </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage that allows it to survive,</v>

684
00:42:13.251 --> 00:42:14.590
<v Speaker 1>but it's costly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

685
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:15.583
<v Speaker 1>It's 99,999 to one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise we'd be covered with </v>

686
00:42:20.631 --> 00:42:21.980
<v Speaker 1>mosquitoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

687
00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:24.133
<v Speaker 1>So the way in the mosquito deals with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you can't figure out </v>

688
00:42:26.091 --> 00:42:28.640
<v Speaker 1>what's going on is by producing lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mosquitoes.</v>

689
00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:33.470
<v Speaker 1>But the way people figure out what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on is by producing lots of ideas.</v>

690
00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:34.903
<v Speaker 1>And ideas are the relationship of ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you and the external world is the </v>

691
00:42:40.941 --> 00:42:45.140
<v Speaker 1>same as the relationship of animals to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment.</v>

692
00:42:45.141 --> 00:42:48.610
<v Speaker 1>So there's a philosopher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alfred North Whitehead who said,</v>

693
00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:53.930
<v Speaker 1>human beings evolved to let their ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>die instead of them.</v>

694
00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:59.270
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a smart way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it means that you can put us off</v>

695
00:42:59.271 --> 00:43:00.104
<v Speaker 1>a little sub personality of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's angry subpersonality or said </v>

696
00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:07.370
<v Speaker 1>seven personality or an irritated or </v>
<v Speaker 1>presented folder,</v>

697
00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:08.260
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

698
00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:09.260
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there aren't exactly.</v>

699
00:43:09.261 --> 00:43:12.530
<v Speaker 1>The idea is they're more like little </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirits that are partly you.</v>

700
00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:14.990
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of stupid because they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>only go one direction,</v>

701
00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:15.853
<v Speaker 1>but there's still variance of you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can present one of those to </v>

702
00:43:19.371 --> 00:43:22.280
<v Speaker 1>someone which you might do if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>dating someone and you want to,</v>

703
00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:23.393
<v Speaker 1>assuming you still do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're dating someone and you want </v>

704
00:43:25.921 --> 00:43:26.754
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've pressed them.</v>

705
00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:27.673
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you spin off some little variance </v>
<v Speaker 1>of yourself that you think is </v>

706
00:43:29.571 --> 00:43:31.790
<v Speaker 1>particularly attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably won't work.</v>

707
00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:34.610
<v Speaker 1>I noticed that work and if it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>work well,</v>

708
00:43:34.611 --> 00:43:36.770
<v Speaker 1>then you can get all heartbroken and let</v>
<v Speaker 1>it die.</v>

709
00:43:36.771 --> 00:43:39.260
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe the next one you spin off</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be a little more,</v>

710
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:40.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

711
00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:42.193
<v Speaker 1>And so that's how people progress a </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress by dying and coming back to </v>

712
00:43:46.701 --> 00:43:49.610
<v Speaker 1>life at different levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean maybe you're just taking some</v>

713
00:43:49.611 --> 00:43:54.050
<v Speaker 1>little ratty mistake and so you can let </v>
<v Speaker 1>it go and you're only shaved momentarily</v>

714
00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:55.093
<v Speaker 1>and it's only a little pain when that </v>
<v Speaker 1>circuit dies or maybe it's your whole </v>

715
00:43:58.011 --> 00:44:00.760
<v Speaker 1>damn personality that has to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

716
00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:01.643
<v Speaker 1>that happens to people when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter a catastrophe of one form or </v>

717
00:44:03.861 --> 00:44:04.694
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

718
00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:06.980
<v Speaker 1>So that might happen to someone close to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you dies.</v>

719
00:44:06.981 --> 00:44:09.890
<v Speaker 1>Or if you lose a landlord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get an illness or you know,</v>

720
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:13.940
<v Speaker 1>any of the horrible things that planning</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to very deep levels,</v>

721
00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:14.803
<v Speaker 1>which might mean pretty much all of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to go and maybe you'll actually </v>

722
00:44:17.541 --> 00:44:18.800
<v Speaker 1>died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't,</v>

723
00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:23.000
<v Speaker 1>well you can let go of what's holding </v>
<v Speaker 1>you back.</v>

724
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:26.240
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's your old self and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can come back to life.</v>

725
00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:30.560
<v Speaker 1>And I will tell you it's a lot better to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that voluntarily before.</v>

726
00:44:30.561 --> 00:44:34.890
<v Speaker 1>It's that in voluntarily in a moment of </v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis.</v>

727
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:39.150
<v Speaker 1>And I would say in some ways that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lesson of clinical psychology.</v>

728
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:40.583
<v Speaker 1>Confront the damn snakes first because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to get out of their </v>

729
00:44:44.671 --> 00:44:49.671
<v Speaker 1>bellies once they beat on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the shopping is shamonic.</v>

730
00:44:50.791 --> 00:44:53.700
<v Speaker 1>Initiations are death and rebirth </v>
<v Speaker 1>initiations.</v>

731
00:44:53.701 --> 00:44:58.701
<v Speaker 1>They formalize that you're often the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rituals themselves are often accompanied</v>

732
00:44:59.371 --> 00:45:02.130
<v Speaker 1>by the use of different classes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hallucinogens,</v>

733
00:45:02.131 --> 00:45:02.964
<v Speaker 1>which for one reason or another seem to </v>
<v Speaker 1>facilitate at least symbolically the </v>

734
00:45:06.751 --> 00:45:11.010
<v Speaker 1>process of transformation from life to </v>
<v Speaker 1>death and back to life.</v>

735
00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:16.580
<v Speaker 1>So there are dramatizations of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process by which people learn.</v>

736
00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:17.963
<v Speaker 1>You learn something to really learn some</v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition that you had before that </v>

737
00:45:22.561 --> 00:45:27.561
<v Speaker 1>has to crumble and then the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>information comes in and you can build a</v>

738
00:45:27.931 --> 00:45:28.764
<v Speaker 1>new self around it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a painful process and that's </v>

739
00:45:30.781 --> 00:45:34.470
<v Speaker 1>part of why people stick to their ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>or their past selves.</v>

740
00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:35.943
<v Speaker 2>No one</v>

741
00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:41.470
<v Speaker 1>you could stick to your past self and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be fine,</v>

742
00:45:41.471 --> 00:45:43.720
<v Speaker 1>except that everything's changing around</v>
<v Speaker 1>you all the time.</v>

743
00:45:43.721 --> 00:45:44.554
<v Speaker 1>And so if you don't change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you just get more and more </v>

744
00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:49.030
<v Speaker 1>outdated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're more and more archaic.</v>

745
00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:51.430
<v Speaker 1>None of your precept positions of work </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

746
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:52.503
<v Speaker 1>And so you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like this rusty machine clanking </v>

747
00:45:56.321 --> 00:45:57.154
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>running into things all the time when </v>

748
00:45:58.211 --> 00:46:01.590
<v Speaker 1>your life is miserable because you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>fit the environment anymore.</v>

749
00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:05.470
<v Speaker 1>And so when I talk about personality and</v>
<v Speaker 1>its transformations,</v>

750
00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:06.573
<v Speaker 1>something that you could ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is in some way the most </v>

751
00:46:08.981 --> 00:46:11.350
<v Speaker 1>fundamental question you can ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself is,</v>

752
00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:13.083
<v Speaker 1>are you the thing that stays the same or</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you the thing that changes and you </v>

753
00:46:18.401 --> 00:46:22.090
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that changes can live in a lot</v>

754
00:46:22.091 --> 00:46:25.240
<v Speaker 1>more places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's we're thinking about,</v>

755
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:26.343
<v Speaker 1>but the cost is well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you changed your diet a little bit </v>

756
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:33.220
<v Speaker 1>and that's painful or maybe you die a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot and that's really painful.</v>

757
00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:37.210
<v Speaker 1>So if you ever wonder why people don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>

758
00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:40.120
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we.</v>

759
00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:41.223
<v Speaker 1>The next section is on constructivism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to talk mostly about PSA is </v>

760
00:46:45.071 --> 00:46:46.840
<v Speaker 1>not actually a developmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist.</v>

761
00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:56.830
<v Speaker 1>I like piaget because Piaget had an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest in question is,</v>

762
00:46:56.831 --> 00:46:57.664
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the genetic question or an </v>

763
00:46:59.471 --> 00:47:02.060
<v Speaker 1>environmental question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

764
00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:04.600
<v Speaker 1>you might think those are the only two </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of questions there are when you're</v>

765
00:47:04.601 --> 00:47:06.730
<v Speaker 1>thinking about the tall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not exactly that.</v>

766
00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:07.793
<v Speaker 1>Here's why</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not clear to what degree your </v>

767
00:47:12.581 --> 00:47:16.720
<v Speaker 1>specified by your genes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's one possibility,</v>

768
00:47:16.721 --> 00:47:17.554
<v Speaker 1>so let's say that encoded in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic structure or whole variety of </v>

769
00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:24.580
<v Speaker 1>potential use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like who knows how many,</v>

770
00:47:25.210 --> 00:47:27.160
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the potential use,</v>

771
00:47:27.161 --> 00:47:27.994
<v Speaker 1>but the entire history of mankind been </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to weave into their genetic </v>

772
00:47:31.001 --> 00:47:31.834
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all sitting down there encoded </v>

773
00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:34.173
<v Speaker 1>in your genes and then that very complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure that's rife with potential </v>

774
00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:39.933
<v Speaker 1>pops out into a particular environment </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it interacts with that </v>

775
00:47:43.001 --> 00:47:43.834
<v Speaker 1>environment like a program interacts </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the computer and gathers </v>

776
00:47:46.421 --> 00:47:47.254
<v Speaker 1>information of one form or another that </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes that information and the material </v>

777
00:47:50.891 --> 00:47:53.980
<v Speaker 1>that is appropriate and builds the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>you out of that.</v>

778
00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:55.173
<v Speaker 1>And that's what piaget was studying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to figure out how as a </v>

779
00:47:58.991 --> 00:47:59.824
<v Speaker 1>child go about taking itself from this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that just lays there squawks </v>

780
00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:07.420
<v Speaker 1>basically to something that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

781
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:09.760
<v Speaker 1>you go on Youtube and you see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>people can do,</v>

782
00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:12.070
<v Speaker 1>what human beings can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bloody unbelievable.</v>

783
00:48:12.071 --> 00:48:16.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're sold ridiculously </v>
<v Speaker 1>versatile.</v>

784
00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:19.460
<v Speaker 1>People can do things that are just </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible in,</v>

785
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:21.070
<v Speaker 1>in every dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

786
00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:23.050
<v Speaker 1>intellectually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physically,</v>

787
00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:24.470
<v Speaker 1>spiritually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

788
00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:25.510
<v Speaker 1>even eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hotdogs,</v>

789
00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:26.433
<v Speaker 1>set a rate that you can hardly imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're very variable and Pinochet was </v>

790
00:48:31.901 --> 00:48:32.734
<v Speaker 1>very interested in trying to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>how all of that embodied variability </v>

791
00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:39.730
<v Speaker 1>could come out of this little package of</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential at the beginning of life.</v>

792
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.610
<v Speaker 1>It's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's constructivism.</v>

793
00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:43.563
<v Speaker 1>How does the individual construct him or</v>
<v Speaker 1>herself from nothing in some ways from </v>

794
00:48:48.850 --> 00:48:49.683
<v Speaker 1>birth forward and so Psj,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially his discussion of infant </v>

795
00:48:53.351 --> 00:48:54.184
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of like the analysis of the </v>

796
00:48:55.541 --> 00:48:59.100
<v Speaker 1>unfolding of a human being and because </v>
<v Speaker 1>people were doing full to you though,</v>

797
00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:00.213
<v Speaker 1>because babies when they're born they'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>crunched up like this and so they have </v>

798
00:49:03.041 --> 00:49:08.041
<v Speaker 1>to stretch out and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get going and I was concerned so.</v>

799
00:49:09.850 --> 00:49:10.870
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>

800
00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.960
<v Speaker 1>And then we go from there to depth </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>

801
00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:17.380
<v Speaker 1>You might think about that more a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysis now</v>

802
00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:22.150
<v Speaker 1>people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

803
00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:26.530
<v Speaker 1>people aren't very happy generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking about psychoanalytic theory,</v>

804
00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:27.873
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're research oriented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a variety of reasons for </v>

805
00:49:31.001 --> 00:49:32.800
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the business,</v>

806
00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:35.520
<v Speaker 1>they don't know anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be the first place.</v>

807
00:49:35.521 --> 00:49:36.354
<v Speaker 1>And then people are often tempted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>denigrate anything they don't </v>

808
00:49:39.821 --> 00:49:40.654
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually kind hard to understand </v>

809
00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:45.250
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in fact,</v>

810
00:49:45.251 --> 00:49:46.084
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard.</v>

811
00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:49.713
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing about like </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists and research scientists who </v>

812
00:49:52.181 --> 00:49:56.050
<v Speaker 1>are engaged in psychological work is </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're actually usually fairly mentally</v>

813
00:49:56.051 --> 00:49:57.690
<v Speaker 1>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

814
00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:59.860
<v Speaker 1>at least they're healthy enough to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists,</v>

815
00:49:59.861 --> 00:50:00.694
<v Speaker 1>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to be pretty healthy to be a </v>

816
00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:03.100
<v Speaker 1>scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go to be disciplined,</v>

817
00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:05.140
<v Speaker 1>you got to be able to get up and go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work every day.</v>

818
00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:07.270
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex things.</v>

819
00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:10.120
<v Speaker 1>You have to be very orderly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>persistent,</v>

820
00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:13.480
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a lot of demand on you if</v>

821
00:50:13.481 --> 00:50:14.314
<v Speaker 1>you're a scientific researcher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the problem with scientific research </v>

822
00:50:17.741 --> 00:50:19.730
<v Speaker 1>is they hang around with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific research,</v>

823
00:50:20.110 --> 00:50:22.080
<v Speaker 1>then they think that's what human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>are like.</v>

824
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:25.690
<v Speaker 1>And human beings are nothing like </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific researchers.</v>

825
00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:28.250
<v Speaker 1>There are a tiny minority of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

826
00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:32.060
<v Speaker 1>There is bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Albino Buffalo and to to think</v>

827
00:50:32.061 --> 00:50:35.060
<v Speaker 1>of them as representative of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings is insane.</v>

828
00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:36.073
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them have high in the 99th </v>

829
00:50:37.671 --> 00:50:38.504
<v Speaker 1>percentile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like why bother even thinking </v>

830
00:50:40.911 --> 00:50:44.810
<v Speaker 1>about them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Normal human beings are very weird,</v>

831
00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:46.003
<v Speaker 1>especially the ones that don't function </v>
<v Speaker 1>well and not functioning well is </v>

832
00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:54.820
<v Speaker 1>bottomless pit that that's why hell is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because not functioning well.</v>

833
00:50:54.861 --> 00:50:55.694
<v Speaker 1>It's a bottomless pit and if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with people who aren't </v>

834
00:50:58.101 --> 00:51:00.860
<v Speaker 1>functioning well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most mysterious things is how</v>

835
00:51:00.861 --> 00:51:01.694
<v Speaker 1>they can take a situation that's gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>off of beyond your worst imaginings and </v>

836
00:51:05.901 --> 00:51:08.900
<v Speaker 1>then think up three or four creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways to make it worse.</v>

837
00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:10.153
<v Speaker 1>Ten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're dealing with somebody like </v>

838
00:51:11.031 --> 00:51:13.430
<v Speaker 1>that and you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a clinician,</v>

839
00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:15.440
<v Speaker 1>if you're dealing with someone like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

840
00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:18.470
<v Speaker 1>good luck with your behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 1>interventions.</v>

841
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:19.543
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like throwing sticks at an </v>

842
00:51:21.321 --> 00:51:22.154
<v Speaker 1>elephant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just going to get anywhere and </v>

843
00:51:24.741 --> 00:51:26.600
<v Speaker 1>one of the ways I want to demonstrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>this to you,</v>

844
00:51:26.601 --> 00:51:30.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to show you a film called </v>
<v Speaker 1>crumb crumbs.</v>

845
00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:31.243
<v Speaker 1>A harsh film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the best documentary by the </v>

846
00:51:33.141 --> 00:51:33.974
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an underground comic named Robert </v>

847
00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:36.073
<v Speaker 1>Crump who's actually quite a genius even</v>
<v Speaker 1>though he's perverse in precisely the </v>

848
00:51:41.121 --> 00:51:44.780
<v Speaker 1>Friday in ways that are interesting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>his brothers or even worse,</v>

849
00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:49.820
<v Speaker 1>so I'll walk you through that because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't figure out any other way of giving</v>

850
00:51:49.821 --> 00:51:52.850
<v Speaker 1>you a taste of what Freudian </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopathology is like.</v>

851
00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:53.803
<v Speaker 1>It's not pretty and that's the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason that sort of clean minded </v>

852
00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:57.733
<v Speaker 1>research scientists don't like </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic thinking because it's </v>

853
00:52:01.581 --> 00:52:02.414
<v Speaker 1>really in many ways it deals with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most disgusting elements of human </v>

854
00:52:06.201 --> 00:52:07.034
<v Speaker 1>behavior and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even that pleasant to think </v>

855
00:52:11.631 --> 00:52:14.720
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's you who will talk about</v>

856
00:52:14.721 --> 00:52:15.554
<v Speaker 1>after Freud and young is so strange that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he makes Freud look normal and you </v>

857
00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:24.710
<v Speaker 1>believed that as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned earlier,</v>

858
00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:28.400
<v Speaker 1>I believe that there is a universal </v>
<v Speaker 1>grammar of ethics,</v>

859
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:29.263
<v Speaker 1>of morality.</v>

860
00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:31.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not relative.</v>

861
00:52:31.311 --> 00:52:33.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the universities,</v>

862
00:52:33.201 --> 00:52:34.034
<v Speaker 1>the theater has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least since the 19 sixties that one </v>

863
00:52:37.821 --> 00:52:38.654
<v Speaker 1>person's ethics is as good as another </v>
<v Speaker 1>person and there's no way of </v>

864
00:52:41.211 --> 00:52:44.240
<v Speaker 1>distinguishing reliably between them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

865
00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:47.150
<v Speaker 1>I happen to think that's absolute </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>

866
00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:51.110
<v Speaker 1>It's also extremely dangerous nonsense </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I also think there's no evidence for</v>

867
00:52:51.111 --> 00:52:54.620
<v Speaker 1>it whatsoever because we now know a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>about human universals,</v>

868
00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:55.513
<v Speaker 1>which are aspects of human behavior that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are constant across all cultures and </v>

869
00:52:58.821 --> 00:53:01.760
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of at.</v>

870
00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:02.603
<v Speaker 1>The other thing is there's just not that</v>
<v Speaker 1>many ways that half mad primates can </v>

871
00:53:06.291 --> 00:53:09.350
<v Speaker 1>gather together in large groups and live</v>
<v Speaker 1>productively.</v>

872
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:10.303
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy like you think of all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization work that went into </v>

873
00:53:14.241 --> 00:53:15.074
<v Speaker 1>allowing all you people from all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>different cultures to sit here in peace </v>

874
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.983
<v Speaker 1>and comfort.</v>

875
00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:24.530
<v Speaker 1>It's mind boggling if you think there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a million ways to do that.</v>

876
00:53:24.531 --> 00:53:27.900
<v Speaker 1>Well think again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's one way to do that,</v>

877
00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:29.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we do it well enough.</v>

878
00:53:29.461 --> 00:53:33.250
<v Speaker 1>So here we are and no one's being knifed</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

879
00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:36.753
<v Speaker 1>so that's you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's profound beyond belief really </v>

880
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:43.740
<v Speaker 1>beyond belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's.</v>

881
00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:46.380
<v Speaker 1>Those guys all dealt with unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

882
00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:47.703
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting to think about what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious means and so I can give you </v>

883
00:53:51.481 --> 00:53:52.470
<v Speaker 1>a bit of a hint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

884
00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:57.300
<v Speaker 1>it's partly the information that's coded</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your behavior,</v>

885
00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:58.253
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of things that you can </v>

886
00:53:59.971 --> 00:54:02.700
<v Speaker 1>do with your body that you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>how you do,</v>

887
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:05.010
<v Speaker 1>like you don't know how you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

888
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:06.930
<v Speaker 1>or how do you ride a bike or how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk.</v>

889
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:09.860
<v Speaker 1>You can talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know how you talk.</v>

890
00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:13.020
<v Speaker 1>You just move your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope you get the point right.</v>

891
00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:17.400
<v Speaker 1>You have no conscious apprehension </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever of the micro details that are</v>

892
00:54:17.401 --> 00:54:18.234
<v Speaker 1>necessary to allow you to move your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth so there's a lot of information </v>

893
00:54:21.271 --> 00:54:22.104
<v Speaker 1>encoded in you that you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious access to and it's not only </v>

894
00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:28.073
<v Speaker 1>physiologically and code.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also culturally encoded because </v>

895
00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:31.263
<v Speaker 1>you've been targeted and shaped by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interactions of all the people you've </v>

896
00:54:35.551 --> 00:54:40.140
<v Speaker 1>ever encountered and they in turn by all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people they've ever encountered,</v>

897
00:54:40.141 --> 00:54:40.974
<v Speaker 1>including their ancestors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're the product of this </v>

898
00:54:42.721 --> 00:54:43.554
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multigenerational exchange of </v>

899
00:54:46.651 --> 00:54:47.484
<v Speaker 1>information that in some ways is all </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how to make you acceptable to the </v>

900
00:54:51.961 --> 00:54:55.050
<v Speaker 1>public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's only certain ways you can be</v>

901
00:54:55.051 --> 00:54:57.690
<v Speaker 1>acceptable to the public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

902
00:54:57.691 --> 00:55:00.210
<v Speaker 1>you have to be relatively clean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

903
00:55:00.211 --> 00:55:01.044
<v Speaker 1>at least in our society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't be too boring or you won't </v>

904
00:55:03.541 --> 00:55:06.620
<v Speaker 1>have any friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also can't be too excited.</v>

905
00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:09.300
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't be too violent.</v>

906
00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:14.870
<v Speaker 1>You can't be too empty headed unless </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're associating with people who liked</v>

907
00:55:14.871 --> 00:55:16.760
<v Speaker 1>to feel superior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know there's,</v>

908
00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:18.990
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We put a lot of demands on each other in</v>

909
00:55:18.991 --> 00:55:23.991
<v Speaker 1>terms of what constitutes acceptibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let alone ideal.</v>

910
00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:27.240
<v Speaker 1>We're always telling each other about </v>
<v Speaker 1>both of those.</v>

911
00:55:27.241 --> 00:55:28.560
<v Speaker 1>What's acceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's ideal.</v>

912
00:55:28.561 --> 00:55:29.394
<v Speaker 1>Every interaction you have shapes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>into an approximation of acceptable in </v>

913
00:55:35.761 --> 00:55:37.890
<v Speaker 1>ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's all encoded in youtube.</v>

914
00:55:37.891 --> 00:55:38.724
<v Speaker 1>It's encoded in your behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also encoded in your imagination </v>

915
00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:42.053
<v Speaker 1>and that's why you can go to a movie and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can instantly identify the hero and </v>

916
00:55:44.731 --> 00:55:45.564
<v Speaker 1>the villain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is of course the first thing you </v>

917
00:55:46.621 --> 00:55:49.230
<v Speaker 1>do when you go to a movie because </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise it can't make sense out of it,</v>

918
00:55:49.770 --> 00:55:52.860
<v Speaker 1>and so that encoding prior to </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulation,</v>

919
00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:53.993
<v Speaker 1>that's on the unconscious and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the psychoanalysts were interested </v>

920
00:55:56.731 --> 00:55:57.564
<v Speaker 1>in analytics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the cognitive neuroscientists have </v>

921
00:55:58.981 --> 00:56:00.520
<v Speaker 1>kind of gone up there too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's.</v>

922
00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:01.373
<v Speaker 1>They're deluded into thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's in your head is information and </v>

923
00:56:04.351 --> 00:56:05.184
<v Speaker 1>that it's ideas and those are sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cold and dead things and your hand is </v>

924
00:56:07.981 --> 00:56:08.814
<v Speaker 1>not full of ideas and information that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>full of devils and snakes and the </v>

925
00:56:12.421 --> 00:56:13.254
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysts knew that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by that I mean you're alive and so </v>

926
00:56:17.161 --> 00:56:17.994
<v Speaker 1>are your sub components and all your </v>
<v Speaker 1>little subpersonalities and aren't just </v>

927
00:56:21.271 --> 00:56:23.110
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They see,</v>

928
00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:25.160
<v Speaker 1>hear it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel it,</v>

929
00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:26.650
<v Speaker 1>have aids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you know.</v>

930
00:56:26.651 --> 00:56:28.710
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get possessed by anger,</v>

931
00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:29.763
<v Speaker 1>the anger can be entirely destructive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to bring down the person I love </v>

932
00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:37.080
<v Speaker 1>half an hour later you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell was I thinking about it?</v>

933
00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:37.983
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

934
00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:39.280
<v Speaker 1>no kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

935
00:56:39.281 --> 00:56:40.114
<v Speaker 1>you weren't thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just possessed by some </v>

936
00:56:42.701 --> 00:56:45.730
<v Speaker 1>personality and that's what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysts were interested in.</v>

937
00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Subpersonalities fantasies.</v>

938
00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:52.053
<v Speaker 1>Next week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to the humanists and the </v>

939
00:56:53.081 --> 00:56:53.914
<v Speaker 1>existentialists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they're interesting because they </v>

940
00:56:56.261 --> 00:56:57.094
<v Speaker 1>come at the problem of what's wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people from a kind of universalist </v>

941
00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:02.350
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now for fraud,</v>

942
00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:03.813
<v Speaker 1>if you weren't sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were healthy and that seems obvious </v>

943
00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:07.623
<v Speaker 1>because we think you can make a clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction between second healthy but </v>

944
00:57:10.690 --> 00:57:12.910
<v Speaker 1>the existentialists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want any of that.</v>

945
00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:18.450
<v Speaker 1>Their hypothesis was if you're human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sick,</v>

946
00:57:20.530 --> 00:57:21.363
<v Speaker 1>there's no way out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason you're sick in a sense </v>

947
00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:24.743
<v Speaker 1>and unlike any other animal is the life </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself poses a paradoxical problem to </v>

948
00:57:30.371 --> 00:57:31.204
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because you're so conscious </v>

949
00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:34.073
<v Speaker 1>because you're self conscious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a sequence of paradoxical </v>

950
00:57:36.611 --> 00:57:39.970
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A how do you live when you're vulnerable</v>

951
00:57:39.971 --> 00:57:40.804
<v Speaker 1>and mortal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a rough one because you might </v>

952
00:57:42.971 --> 00:57:43.391
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

953
00:57:43.391 --> 00:57:44.224
<v Speaker 1>why should I go on at all or who's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know anyways in the thousand years </v>

954
00:57:47.051 --> 00:57:51.550
<v Speaker 1>are a million years or why is there </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>

955
00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:54.070
<v Speaker 1>or how do you go on in the face of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cruelty?</v>

956
00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:55.593
<v Speaker 1>Those are questions that grip at </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's soul and crush it and they're </v>

957
00:57:59.951 --> 00:58:03.010
<v Speaker 1>not a consequence of mental illness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

958
00:58:03.090 --> 00:58:03.923
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long should it take you to recover </v>

959
00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:08.170
<v Speaker 1>if your whole family is wiped out in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>car accident?</v>

960
00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:10.120
<v Speaker 1>What's healthy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

961
00:58:10.121 --> 00:58:11.980
<v Speaker 1>we don't know the answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

962
00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:13.083
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't you ever recover?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a fewer halfways in path that </v>

963
00:58:15.850 --> 00:58:18.250
<v Speaker 1>would just kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

964
00:58:18.251 --> 00:58:21.480
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times people can't recover from</v>
<v Speaker 1>their grief because they're building.</v>

965
00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:22.660
<v Speaker 1>If they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can I?</v>

966
00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:23.733
<v Speaker 1>How can I live with all of those people </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to me died and they died on </v>

967
00:58:26.321 --> 00:58:28.540
<v Speaker 1>therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an existential problem.</v>

968
00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:33.840
<v Speaker 1>And then there's one class which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability and more talented.</v>

969
00:58:34.690 --> 00:58:35.523
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's got that stereotype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you deal with that hard </v>

970
00:58:39.281 --> 00:58:41.920
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second class of problems?</v>

971
00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's always evaluating always and</v>

972
00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:50.080
<v Speaker 1>you're never good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is that you're always</v>

973
00:58:50.081 --> 00:58:52.720
<v Speaker 1>in an insufficient relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 1>society in history.</v>

974
00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:56.320
<v Speaker 1>No matter how good you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not good enough.</v>

975
00:58:57.370 --> 00:59:02.370
<v Speaker 1>And so history itself as well as culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>always faces you as a judge.</v>

976
00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:07.220
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the second category of </v>
<v Speaker 1>existential problem.</v>

977
00:59:07.221 --> 00:59:08.054
<v Speaker 1>Then the third problem is well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what to do about you yourself know </v>

978
00:59:12.821 --> 00:59:13.654
<v Speaker 1>there's nature you have to contend with </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's culture you will have to </v>

979
00:59:15.731 --> 00:59:16.564
<v Speaker 1>contend with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you've got yourself and your </v>

980
00:59:19.211 --> 00:59:20.044
<v Speaker 1>self consciousness and your deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge of all the things about you </v>

981
00:59:22.221 --> 00:59:23.054
<v Speaker 1>that could really use some repair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about those prompts is </v>

982
00:59:26.061 --> 00:59:28.320
<v Speaker 1>that everyone has them and they always </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the,</v>

983
00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:30.620
<v Speaker 1>as far as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always will,</v>

984
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:33.260
<v Speaker 1>and so they're built into the condition </v>
<v Speaker 1>of being human.</v>

985
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:38.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's what existentialism is about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like life is a paradoxical problem.</v>

986
00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:43.760
<v Speaker 1>Is there any possible solution to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>paradoxical problem?</v>

987
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

988
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:47.990
<v Speaker 1>that's in some ways the question of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning of life.</v>

989
00:59:48.830 --> 00:59:51.740
<v Speaker 1>And one hint is that what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the meaning of life?</v>

990
00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:54.320
<v Speaker 1>And one answer to that is this is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>

991
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:55.303
<v Speaker 1>is that the meaning to life is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern of thought and action that you </v>

992
00:59:59.541 --> 01:00:04.541
<v Speaker 1>take that enables you to tolerate at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least tolerate the conditions of luck.</v>

993
01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:08.150
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you could move one step </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond that.</v>

994
01:00:08.151 --> 01:00:08.984
<v Speaker 1>If you're feeling a little optimistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>and say meaning of life is the pattern </v>

995
01:00:11.661 --> 01:00:12.494
<v Speaker 1>of consumption inaction that enables you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to welcome the conditions of life and </v>

996
01:00:17.031 --> 01:00:17.864
<v Speaker 1>then you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there such a mode of being given the </v>

997
01:00:20.871 --> 01:00:22.970
<v Speaker 1>nature of the problem that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>contend with it?</v>

998
01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:25.760
<v Speaker 1>Is there actually a motive be that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>enable that?</v>

999
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:29.720
<v Speaker 1>You could say the vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the judgment,</v>

1000
01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:34.040
<v Speaker 1>the insufficiency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worth it under these conditions and</v>

1001
01:00:34.041 --> 01:00:37.970
<v Speaker 1>that's the other existential question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people who post those questions,</v>

1002
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:41.480
<v Speaker 1>they weren't messing around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to read people like frankl,</v>

1003
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:45.980
<v Speaker 1>Viktor Frankl and their social needs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what those do people live through.</v>

1004
01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:47.173
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's unimaginably horrible and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they were wrestling with the </v>

1005
01:00:51.501 --> 01:00:54.860
<v Speaker 1>questions that I just described,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't academic.</v>

1006
01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:56.653
<v Speaker 1>They weren't academic issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were embodied issues of life and </v>

1007
01:01:01.551 --> 01:01:02.384
<v Speaker 1>culture and genocide and cruelty</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so their examination of that had to </v>

1008
01:01:10.371 --> 01:01:11.204
<v Speaker 1>be deep enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to contend with questions </v>

1009
01:01:14.781 --> 01:01:17.750
<v Speaker 1>like that and answers that are deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to contend with.</v>

1010
01:01:17.751 --> 01:01:20.330
<v Speaker 1>Questions like that are frightening </v>
<v Speaker 1>answers</v>

1011
01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:25.640
<v Speaker 1>and we have reading week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll be a relief.</v>

1012
01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:35.083
<v Speaker 1>The last part of the course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is when we switched over to the </v>

1013
01:01:38.721 --> 01:01:41.240
<v Speaker 1>more scientific domain and so we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do two things.</v>

1014
01:01:41.241 --> 01:01:42.074
<v Speaker 1>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to take a pretty deep look </v>

1015
01:01:43.641 --> 01:01:44.474
<v Speaker 1>at how the brain functions as far as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>know in our current state of </v>

1016
01:01:48.111 --> 01:01:53.111
<v Speaker 1>unimaginable ignorance like we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We really know so little about the brain</v>

1017
01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:56.780
<v Speaker 1>or maybe we know a bit of a bit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain,</v>

1018
01:01:56.781 --> 01:01:57.614
<v Speaker 1>but we certainly don't know anything yet</v>
<v Speaker 1>about consciousness and consciousness </v>

1019
01:02:00.471 --> 01:02:03.710
<v Speaker 1>seems to be a very relevant part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>

1020
01:02:03.711 --> 01:02:04.544
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of the part that everybody </v>

1021
01:02:05.271 --> 01:02:08.840
<v Speaker 1>cares about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six consciousness in some sense seems to</v>

1022
01:02:08.841 --> 01:02:11.450
<v Speaker 1>be you even more than your brain is you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1023
01:02:11.451 --> 01:02:13.790
<v Speaker 1>your brain's just this thing inside your</v>
<v Speaker 1>skull,</v>

1024
01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:16.220
<v Speaker 1>but your consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1025
01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.233
<v Speaker 1>that's your being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have a clue about </v>

1026
01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:23.430
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I our scientific,</v>

1027
01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:27.090
<v Speaker 1>we're not even able to conceptualize it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a scientific manner.</v>

1028
01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:28.980
<v Speaker 1>It's a real mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1029
01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:29.963
<v Speaker 1>but having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still plenty of things that are </v>

1030
01:02:31.741 --> 01:02:34.860
<v Speaker 1>interesting to know about the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things we're going to do,</v>

1031
01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:37.880
<v Speaker 1>and this is sort of associated with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of the end,</v>

1032
01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:39.093
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end for Freud was the natural self </v>

1033
01:02:42.030 --> 01:02:42.863
<v Speaker 1>and so that was your primordial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could think about them as drives or </v>

1034
01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:47.910
<v Speaker 1>temptations or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or values.</v>

1035
01:02:48.810 --> 01:02:51.500
<v Speaker 1>Values is probably the most accurate </v>
<v Speaker 1>anger,</v>

1036
01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:53.160
<v Speaker 1>sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the top two,</v>

1037
01:02:53.161 --> 01:02:53.994
<v Speaker 1>Friday and concerns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty others eating for didn't </v>

1038
01:02:56.941 --> 01:02:57.774
<v Speaker 1>care about that we do now because </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone has an eating disorder or </v>

1039
01:03:00.631 --> 01:03:04.980
<v Speaker 1>virtually everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for the Victorians it was sexuality.</v>

1040
01:03:04.981 --> 01:03:08.010
<v Speaker 1>For us it's food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sex doesn't seem to be a problem,</v>

1041
01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:13.240
<v Speaker 1>but we just can't eat anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to take a look at the low</v>

1042
01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:17.580
<v Speaker 1>level biological systems in the brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>and those are systems go on.</v>

1043
01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:21.840
<v Speaker 1>Some of those systems are so old that </v>
<v Speaker 1>even crustaceans have.</v>

1044
01:03:22.650 --> 01:03:24.420
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is so cool.</v>

1045
01:03:24.421 --> 01:03:25.254
<v Speaker 1>So if you give a lobster who's being </v>
<v Speaker 1>defeated in a dominance fight because </v>

1046
01:03:29.770 --> 01:03:34.770
<v Speaker 1>they fight for dominance and they might </v>
<v Speaker 1>even know it if you mean the lobster.</v>

1047
01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.830
<v Speaker 1>If you take a lobster who's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>defeated in a dominance dispute,</v>

1048
01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:39.743
<v Speaker 1>he'll go back to his little lobster hole</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pout and when out and he gets all </v>

1049
01:03:44.281 --> 01:03:45.114
<v Speaker 1>collapsed and you can't even read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get them out of his hole with a stick </v>

1050
01:03:47.401 --> 01:03:48.234
<v Speaker 1>because he's going to sit in there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>be upset about his dominance defeat and </v>

1051
01:03:52.231 --> 01:03:54.720
<v Speaker 1>maybe he'll come on with kind of a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>lobster already.</v>

1052
01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:55.583
<v Speaker 1>Go again and maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you take that same lobster and you </v>

1053
01:03:58.931 --> 01:04:01.440
<v Speaker 1>give him anti depressants right after he</v>
<v Speaker 1>fights,</v>

1054
01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:06.690
<v Speaker 1>he won't go back into his cave and hide </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he'll fight right away again,</v>

1055
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:08.040
<v Speaker 1>and so you think about that.</v>

1056
01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:08.873
<v Speaker 1>That means that the circuitry that </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlies our defeat related depression </v>

1057
01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:18.420
<v Speaker 1>is 300 million years old and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>crustaceans have</v>

1058
01:04:20.010 --> 01:04:22.440
<v Speaker 1>so that's way down in your brainstem </v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1059
01:04:22.441 --> 01:04:24.360
<v Speaker 1>because lobsters hardly even have </v>
<v Speaker 1>brains.</v>

1060
01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:27.390
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the last year has been tough and he's</v>

1061
01:04:27.391 --> 01:04:30.990
<v Speaker 1>been launched here for a long time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets defeated badly,</v>

1062
01:04:31.470 --> 01:04:34.890
<v Speaker 1>then when he goes off to pout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has to dissolve as whole brain is.</v>

1063
01:04:34.891 --> 01:04:35.724
<v Speaker 1>All he does is dominant stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it grows a new subordinate brain </v>

1064
01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:39.713
<v Speaker 1>weasels around with that for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and that's useful to think about the </v>

1065
01:04:43.501 --> 01:04:46.950
<v Speaker 1>next time you to get defeated because </v>
<v Speaker 1>all that pain you're going through,</v>

1066
01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:51.390
<v Speaker 1>it's like you've got some circuit </v>
<v Speaker 1>repairs to make and if you've been badly</v>

1067
01:04:51.391 --> 01:04:52.224
<v Speaker 1>defeated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe you should just let yourself </v>

1068
01:04:53.371 --> 01:04:57.630
<v Speaker 1>collapsed and all of that stuff clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>away so you could come back.</v>

1069
01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:04.380
<v Speaker 1>So that's low level stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brainstem stuff.</v>

1070
01:05:04.410 --> 01:05:06.490
<v Speaker 1>It's way down at the bottom of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

1071
01:05:06.550 --> 01:05:07.383
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to talk about systems </v>

1072
01:05:08.821 --> 01:05:10.500
<v Speaker 1>that are above that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still low.</v>

1073
01:05:10.501 --> 01:05:11.880
<v Speaker 1>The hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1074
01:05:11.881 --> 01:05:15.390
<v Speaker 1>it's a very cool brain area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sort of responsible for all the basic</v>

1075
01:05:15.391 --> 01:05:16.224
<v Speaker 1>drives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunger,</v>

1076
01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:17.250
<v Speaker 1>temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regulation,</v>

1077
01:05:17.290 --> 01:05:19.140
<v Speaker 1>sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1078
01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:21.860
<v Speaker 1>defensive aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory aggression.</v>

1079
01:05:21.861 --> 01:05:25.030
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it's something different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone has those systems,</v>

1080
01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:26.233
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're like these sub beings that </v>

1081
01:05:27.671 --> 01:05:28.504
<v Speaker 1>live inside us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're also preconditions for </v>

1082
01:05:29.801 --> 01:05:31.350
<v Speaker 1>communication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1083
01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:32.203
<v Speaker 1>because you might say to your friend or </v>
<v Speaker 1>an angry today and your friend doesn't </v>

1084
01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:35.651
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1085
01:05:35.651 --> 01:05:37.930
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean angry?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

1086
01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:40.230
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened to upset?</v>

1087
01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:43.180
<v Speaker 1>Because he knows what anger begins and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason he knows that his,</v>

1088
01:05:43.181 --> 01:05:45.430
<v Speaker 1>because he's already it in his head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1089
01:05:45.431 --> 01:05:47.830
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets angry,</v>

1090
01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:49.370
<v Speaker 1>get sad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets afraid.</v>

1091
01:05:49.810 --> 01:05:52.120
<v Speaker 1>Basic emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not only the basic emotions,</v>

1092
01:05:52.121 --> 01:05:54.540
<v Speaker 1>but the basic motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're gonna.</v>

1093
01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:55.393
<v Speaker 1>Look at the brain systems that underlie </v>
<v Speaker 1>the basic motivations and the basic </v>

1094
01:05:59.351 --> 01:06:00.184
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in some sense those systems are </v>

1095
01:06:02.231 --> 01:06:07.080
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to the physiological </v>
<v Speaker 1>incarnation of the end.</v>

1096
01:06:07.090 --> 01:06:10.180
<v Speaker 1>That Freud described that the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>19th century.</v>

1097
01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:11.283
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a nice way to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll build through the psychoanalytic </v>

1098
01:06:13.091 --> 01:06:14.980
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

1099
01:06:14.981 --> 01:06:18.480
<v Speaker 1>which kind of puts flesh on these </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems because for the psychoanalyst,</v>

1100
01:06:18.481 --> 01:06:21.460
<v Speaker 1>and this is why they're still relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those weren't just systems.</v>

1101
01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're living personalities.</v>

1102
01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Narrow one I personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they only want one thing,</v>

1103
01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:31.580
<v Speaker 1>but personalities nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient gone.</v>

1104
01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:34.360
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of looking at and </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1105
01:06:34.361 --> 01:06:38.230
<v Speaker 1>You have to condense it again with </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you believe in them or not.</v>

1106
01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:44.170
<v Speaker 1>We'll discuss all five traits as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Extroversion,</v>

1107
01:06:44.650 --> 01:06:46.210
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's positive emotion.</v>

1108
01:06:46.930 --> 01:06:48.640
<v Speaker 1>Neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's negative emotion.</v>

1109
01:06:48.641 --> 01:06:51.100
<v Speaker 1>People vary on those dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Agreeableness,</v>

1110
01:06:51.101 --> 01:06:51.934
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>maternal behavior on one end and </v>

1111
01:06:54.881 --> 01:06:59.230
<v Speaker 1>predatory hunting on another because </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings are hunters and mammals.</v>

1112
01:06:59.290 --> 01:07:00.940
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird combination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1113
01:07:00.941 --> 01:07:01.774
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're a hunting panel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to figure out how not to kill </v>

1114
01:07:04.001 --> 01:07:05.920
<v Speaker 1>and eat your children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1115
01:07:05.921 --> 01:07:08.020
<v Speaker 1>And that happens in lots of mammalian </v>
<v Speaker 1>species,</v>

1116
01:07:08.021 --> 01:07:11.020
<v Speaker 1>especially among the males.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have to be moved away,</v>

1117
01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:13.600
<v Speaker 1>but he would have solved that more or </v>
<v Speaker 1>less.</v>

1118
01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:14.963
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets complicated in mixed families </v>

1119
01:07:17.141 --> 01:07:19.990
<v Speaker 1>because if you're the child of the step </v>
<v Speaker 1>parent,</v>

1120
01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:24.670
<v Speaker 1>you have 100 times the likelihood of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being abused,</v>

1121
01:07:25.810 --> 01:07:26.643
<v Speaker 1>so we'll talk about conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a great predictor of longterm </v>

1122
01:07:30.581 --> 01:07:31.414
<v Speaker 1>life success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also associated with fascist </v>

1123
01:07:33.341 --> 01:07:34.174
<v Speaker 1>political priest predispositions because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that the way you vote has </v>

1124
01:07:37.841 --> 01:07:38.674
<v Speaker 1>very little to do with what you say and </v>
<v Speaker 1>very much to do with what your </v>

1125
01:07:42.521 --> 01:07:43.354
<v Speaker 1>temperament is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even for high level cognitive </v>

1126
01:07:48.341 --> 01:07:49.174
<v Speaker 1>functions like political belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these underlying systems play in </v>

1127
01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:56.920
<v Speaker 1>determining role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last two things.</v>

1128
01:07:56.921 --> 01:08:01.090
<v Speaker 1>We're going to talk about performance </v>
<v Speaker 1>prediction and by that I mean well,</v>

1129
01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:03.580
<v Speaker 1>there's been accruing evidence.</v>

1130
01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:06.640
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1131
01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:07.430
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1132
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:09.070
<v Speaker 1>How do you have a happy life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1133
01:08:09.071 --> 01:08:12.790
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that's a stupid question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'll go because happiness isn't.</v>

1134
01:08:13.210 --> 01:08:15.260
<v Speaker 1>It's not the right eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1135
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:18.300
<v Speaker 1>it's a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a place to go.</v>

1136
01:08:18.330 --> 01:08:22.350
<v Speaker 1>It's a matter of manifestation while </v>
<v Speaker 1>your journey,</v>

1137
01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:24.720
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leaving that aside,</v>

1138
01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:27.570
<v Speaker 1>what do you need to live a high quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>

1139
01:08:27.830 --> 01:08:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we kind of know that already.</v>

1140
01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:31.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of obvious.</v>

1141
01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:34.920
<v Speaker 1>No need friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>need intimate relationships,</v>

1142
01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:37.300
<v Speaker 1>lead meaningful work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1143
01:08:37.650 --> 01:08:39.960
<v Speaker 1>how are you more money than we'll pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>your pills,</v>

1144
01:08:39.961 --> 01:08:42.420
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem to help that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc. Etc.</v>

1145
01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:43.340
<v Speaker 1>So it's likE,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1146
01:08:43.350 --> 01:08:45.750
<v Speaker 1>it's like intelligent moderation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplines.</v>

1147
01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:48.360
<v Speaker 1>Very boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'S exactly what you'd expect.</v>

1148
01:08:48.361 --> 01:08:50.430
<v Speaker 1>if you were pessimistic about </v>
<v Speaker 1>excitement,</v>

1149
01:08:52.170 --> 01:08:53.003
<v Speaker 1>performance prediction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to look very carefully at </v>

1150
01:08:54.811 --> 01:08:57.180
<v Speaker 1>the nature of the traits that make </v>
<v Speaker 1>people successful in life.</v>

1151
01:08:57.180 --> 01:08:57.991
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

1152
01:08:57.991 --> 01:08:59.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean by successful?</v>

1153
01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:00.773
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I mean is not in too </v>

1154
01:09:02.581 --> 01:09:03.414
<v Speaker 1>much pain and anxiety is that turns out </v>
<v Speaker 1>to actually be more important to people </v>

1155
01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:08.700
<v Speaker 1>than being happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1156
01:09:08.701 --> 01:09:10.750
<v Speaker 1>if you say to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want?</v>

1157
01:09:10.770 --> 01:09:11.603
<v Speaker 1>They say I want to be happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you analyze what they mean by </v>

1158
01:09:13.531 --> 01:09:14.364
<v Speaker 1>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they mostly need not suffering and not </v>

1159
01:09:17.521 --> 01:09:20.730
<v Speaker 1>terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get those two things under control.</v>

1160
01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:23.350
<v Speaker 1>Like the worst that can happen to you is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you'll be bored.</v>

1161
01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:27.710
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll wrap it up at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1162
01:09:27.750 --> 01:09:31.460
<v Speaker 1>so that's the course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>

1163
01:09:33.290 --> 01:09:36.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad to be teaching it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good to see all of you here.</v>

1164
01:09:36.391 --> 01:09:38.310
<v Speaker 1>It looks like you're trying to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable classroom,</v>

1165
01:09:38.311 --> 01:09:43.311
<v Speaker 1>so that's kind of nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Decide if you decide if you want to take</v>

1166
01:09:43.801 --> 01:09:46.080
<v Speaker 1>the course because I don't want you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be disappointed that.</v>

1167
01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:47.933
<v Speaker 1>So I'm really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really telling you seriously to like </v>

1168
01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:51.153
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you like this lecture to like the </v>

1169
01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:56.570
<v Speaker 1>course and you got to do the reading and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a fair bit of free.</v>

1170
01:09:57.510 --> 01:10:00.540
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll see if there's.</v>
