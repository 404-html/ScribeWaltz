1
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.583
<v Speaker 1>Neat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You talking about the European state of </v>

2
00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:39.000
<v Speaker 1>mind at the end of the 19th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Nisha says,</v>

3
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:41.010
<v Speaker 1>well we're in this terrible situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.350
<v Speaker 1>God is dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've killed them.</v>

5
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.303
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While we've taken our evolved </v>

6
00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:49.560
<v Speaker 1>metaphysics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which structures are moral viewpoint and</v>

7
00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:52.870
<v Speaker 1>undermined by rational criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a peculiar move,</v>

8
00:00:52.871 --> 00:00:55.740
<v Speaker 1>Toma softly cause it was never </v>
<v Speaker 1>established on rational grounds.</v>

9
00:00:55.741 --> 00:00:56.574
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've undermined it rationally and </v>

10
00:00:57.511 --> 00:01:00.510
<v Speaker 1>replaced it with well nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

11
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:02.483
<v Speaker 1>What's the consequences that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well he outlines that here of what is </v>

12
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:07.764
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One must either be silent or speak with </v>

13
00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:14.301
<v Speaker 1>greatness and you can think about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a prophecy on the events of World War</v>

14
00:01:14.371 --> 00:01:15.204
<v Speaker 1>One and World War II and the Gulag </v>
<v Speaker 1>archipelago and the 60 million people </v>

15
00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:20.124
<v Speaker 1>dead in the Soviet Union and the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfolding of 20th century history and </v>

16
00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:28.730
<v Speaker 1>the great ideological battles that </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterize that unfolding.</v>

17
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.573
<v Speaker 1>So this is something nature sees coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>and knows was why he says of what is </v>

18
00:01:33.061 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

19
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.090
<v Speaker 1>One must either be silent or speak with </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatness,</v>

20
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.013
<v Speaker 1>with greatness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means cynically I'm with </v>

21
00:01:39.401 --> 00:01:40.234
<v Speaker 1>innocence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I related to the history of the </v>

22
00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:44.850
<v Speaker 1>next two centuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I describe what is coming,</v>

23
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.170
<v Speaker 1>what can no longer come differently?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The advent of nihilism,</v>

24
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The belief and nothing.</v>

25
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.223
<v Speaker 1>Our whole European culture is moving for</v>
<v Speaker 1>some time now with a tortured tension </v>

26
00:01:55.531 --> 00:01:56.364
<v Speaker 1>that's growing from decade to decade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was towards a catastrophe restlessly </v>

27
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.893
<v Speaker 1>violently headlong like a river that </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to reach the end that no longer </v>

28
00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:07.350
<v Speaker 1>reflects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's afraid to reflect.</v>

29
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.910
<v Speaker 1>He that speaks here has conversely done </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing so far,</v>

30
00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:12.744
<v Speaker 1>but to reflect as a philosopher and </v>
<v Speaker 1>solitary by instinct who is found his </v>

31
00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:17.394
<v Speaker 1>advantage and standing aside outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is the advent of nihilism become </v>

32
00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:22.224
<v Speaker 1>necessary?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the values we've had hitherto </v>

33
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.240
<v Speaker 1>thus draw their final consequence </v>
<v Speaker 1>because nihilism represents the ultimate</v>

34
00:02:30.241 --> 00:02:33.030
<v Speaker 1>logical conclusion of our great values </v>
<v Speaker 1>and ideals.</v>

35
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.373
<v Speaker 1>Because we must experience nihilism </v>
<v Speaker 1>before we can find out what value these </v>

36
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:41.910
<v Speaker 1>values really had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We require at some sometime new values.</v>

37
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.590
<v Speaker 1>Nihilism stands at the door when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes this uncanny,</v>

38
00:02:46.591 --> 00:02:49.860
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guests nihilism,</v>

39
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your beliefs or undermined once.</v>

40
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.260
<v Speaker 1>What's the consequence of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

41
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.103
<v Speaker 1>one consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The belief has undermined the other </v>

42
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More metaphysical,</v>

43
00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 1>which is fooled once you no longer have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the belief.</v>

44
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.010
<v Speaker 1>But maybe it's even worse than that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because human beings can generalize,</v>

45
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.053
<v Speaker 1>fooled once you never have any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you no longer have any belief in </v>

46
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:15.220
<v Speaker 1>beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which mean you say something like this,</v>

47
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what you think.</v>

48
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.173
<v Speaker 1>The world is such a terrible place that </v>
<v Speaker 1>no interpretation whatsoever can </v>

49
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:25.060
<v Speaker 1>possibly suffice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nihilism.</v>

50
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.930
<v Speaker 1>No meaning system whatsoever can </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly suffice.</v>

51
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the flaw or the flyers?</v>

52
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.501
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

53
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:33.334
<v Speaker 1>no system of coherent belief can suffice</v>
<v Speaker 1>because most of the world's </v>

54
00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:40.480
<v Speaker 1>transcendent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't encapsulate everything that is</v>

55
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.100
<v Speaker 1>in your sphere of belief.</v>

56
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.113
<v Speaker 1>And what you might say then is that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you ever believe that what you believe </v>

57
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:48.010
<v Speaker 1>is what should support you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the facts,</v>

58
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:49.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

59
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.100
<v Speaker 1>or the interpretation you place in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

60
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.780
<v Speaker 1>then your faith is badly misplaced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't believe in what you believe.</v>

61
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.790
<v Speaker 1>You believe in something that's deeper </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>

62
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.060
<v Speaker 1>And so then you see what's wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tolstoy,</v>

63
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And tolstoy story.</v>

64
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.340
<v Speaker 1>And tolstoy says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

65
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.220
<v Speaker 1>accounting for his collapse in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stability of Christian belief.</v>

66
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:14.290
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this all happened,</v>

67
00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 1>this collapse of my belief when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>not yet 50 years old,</v>

68
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.500
<v Speaker 1>I should have been considered a </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely happy man.</v>

69
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:21.603
<v Speaker 1>I had a good loving and beloved wife </v>
<v Speaker 1>find children and the largest state </v>

70
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.010
<v Speaker 1>growing and expanding without any effort</v>
<v Speaker 1>on my part.</v>

71
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.440
<v Speaker 1>I was respected by friends and </v>
<v Speaker 1>acquaintances,</v>

72
00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:32.620
<v Speaker 1>praised by strangers and could claim a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain renown.</v>

73
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.440
<v Speaker 1>I was not physically nor mentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>unhealthy.</v>

74
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.530
<v Speaker 1>On the contrary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed a physical and mental vigor.</v>

75
00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:40.870
<v Speaker 1>I had rarely encountered among others my</v>
<v Speaker 1>age.</v>

76
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.973
<v Speaker 1>I could keep up with a peasant's working</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the fields and work eight and 10 </v>

77
00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:45.274
<v Speaker 1>hours at a stretch without suffering any</v>
<v Speaker 1>after effects from the stream and in </v>

78
00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:51.940
<v Speaker 1>such a state of affairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came to a point where I could not live</v>

79
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:53.523
<v Speaker 1>and even though I fear death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to employ ruses against myself to </v>

80
00:04:56.351 --> 00:04:57.184
<v Speaker 1>keep from committing suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was as though I had lived a little </v>

81
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:01.683
<v Speaker 1>wondered a little until I came to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>precipice and I clearly saw that there </v>

82
00:05:04.751 --> 00:05:09.010
<v Speaker 1>was nothing ahead except room and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was no stopping or turning back.</v>

83
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.143
<v Speaker 1>No closing my eyes so that I would not </v>
<v Speaker 1>see that there was nothing ahead except </v>

84
00:05:12.401 --> 00:05:13.234
<v Speaker 1>the deception of life and of happiness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and of the reality of suffering and </v>

85
00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:18.130
<v Speaker 1>death of complete annihilation.</v>

86
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.863
<v Speaker 1>I grew sick of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some irresistible force was leading me </v>

87
00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:23.044
<v Speaker 1>to somehow get rid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This thought was such a temptation that </v>

88
00:05:26.051 --> 00:05:29.890
<v Speaker 1>I had to use counting against myself in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to not to go through with it.</v>

89
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.083
<v Speaker 1>And there I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fortunate man carrying a rope from my </v>

90
00:05:34.481 --> 00:05:35.314
<v Speaker 1>room where I was alone every night as I </v>
<v Speaker 1>addressed so that I would not hang </v>

91
00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:38.374
<v Speaker 1>myself from the beam between the closets</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I quit going hunting with a gun so </v>

92
00:05:41.621 --> 00:05:44.380
<v Speaker 1>that I would not be too easily tempted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to rid myself of life.</v>

93
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.550
<v Speaker 1>I myself did not know what I wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was afraid of life.</v>

94
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.340
<v Speaker 1>I struggled to get rid of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet I hope for something from it.</v>

95
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.983
<v Speaker 1>My position was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew that I could find nothing in the </v>

96
00:05:55.361 --> 00:05:56.194
<v Speaker 1>way of rational knowledge except denial </v>
<v Speaker 1>of life and in faith I could find </v>

97
00:05:59.391 --> 00:06:03.590
<v Speaker 1>nothing except the denial of reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me this was even more impossible</v>

98
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:08.120
<v Speaker 1>than a denial of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I myself according to rational knowledge</v>

99
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:10.790
<v Speaker 1>at followed that life is evil and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>know it.</v>

100
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.840
<v Speaker 1>I describe my spiritual condition of </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself in this way.</v>

101
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:16.180
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

102
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.013
<v Speaker 1>My life has some kind of stupid and evil</v>
<v Speaker 1>practical joke that someone is playing </v>

103
00:06:19.631 --> 00:06:20.464
<v Speaker 1>on me in spite of the fact that I did </v>
<v Speaker 1>not acknowledge the existence of any </v>

104
00:06:23.621 --> 00:06:24.454
<v Speaker 1>someone who might've created me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The notion that someone brought me into </v>

105
00:06:27.431 --> 00:06:28.264
<v Speaker 1>the world as a stupid and evil joke seem</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the most natural way to describe </v>

106
00:06:31.541 --> 00:06:32.374
<v Speaker 1>my condition.</v>

107
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

108
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.680
<v Speaker 1>I could not be deceived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All is vanity.</v>

109
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.670
<v Speaker 1>Happy is he was never been born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Death is better than life.</v>

110
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.020
<v Speaker 1>We must rid ourselves of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having realized all the stupidity of the</v>

111
00:06:45.021 --> 00:06:45.854
<v Speaker 1>joke that is being played on us and </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing that the blessings of the dead </v>

112
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.350
<v Speaker 1>are greater than those are the living </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that it's better not to exist.</v>

113
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.393
<v Speaker 1>The strong act and put an end to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid joke and they use any means of </v>

114
00:06:55.251 --> 00:06:57.290
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A rope around the neck,</v>

115
00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.530
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a knife in the heart or a train.</v>

116
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.050
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interesting thing about this,</v>

117
00:07:03.051 --> 00:07:05.600
<v Speaker 1>I think is first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Russian wrote it and second of all,</v>

118
00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:06.434
<v Speaker 1>it was written in the late 19 hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 1>and even more particularly is that you </v>

119
00:07:09.321 --> 00:07:12.530
<v Speaker 1>note that when the strong act using a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rope around the neck,</v>

120
00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:14.810
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a knife in the heart and a train,</v>

121
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.003
<v Speaker 1>well tolstoy is talking about suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no necessary reason to </v>

122
00:07:18.801 --> 00:07:22.130
<v Speaker 1>presume that this should only be </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence and gender against the self,</v>

123
00:07:22.131 --> 00:07:24.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If life is a stupid and evil joke,</v>

124
00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:25.364
<v Speaker 1>then what's stopping you from </v>
<v Speaker 1>benevolently putting an end to the </v>

125
00:07:29.691 --> 00:07:31.070
<v Speaker 1>suffering of others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

126
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.090
<v Speaker 1>Benevolently in theory at least.</v>

127
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:40.731
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

128
00:07:40.731 --> 00:07:41.990
<v Speaker 1>that's one perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

129
00:07:41.991 --> 00:07:42.824
<v Speaker 1>But then there's always the perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the lady who went to see the </v>

130
00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:48.410
<v Speaker 1>psychiatrist in ts Elliot's poem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

131
00:07:48.411 --> 00:07:50.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if when your eyes are open,</v>

132
00:07:50.961 --> 00:07:54.560
<v Speaker 1>life appears as nothing but suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>and pain to you.</v>

133
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:55.573
<v Speaker 1>It could be that that is how life is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it can also be that there's </v>

134
00:07:58.671 --> 00:08:00.980
<v Speaker 1>something wrong with the way that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the world.</v>

135
00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:03.950
<v Speaker 1>And in some ways that's a much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>humble perspective,</v>

136
00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:06.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the alternative the as well,</v>

137
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:06.973
<v Speaker 1>I know what's going on and I just look </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there and there's the world and I'm </v>

138
00:08:09.191 --> 00:08:10.024
<v Speaker 1>pretty much got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I know what it means and what it </v>

139
00:08:11.691 --> 00:08:12.524
<v Speaker 1>means is pointless suffering and pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's my model and I don't see any </v>

140
00:08:16.401 --> 00:08:18.590
<v Speaker 1>reason to question it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the alternative is,</v>

141
00:08:18.591 --> 00:08:19.850
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a second.</v>

142
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:20.983
<v Speaker 1>There's always the possibility that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know absolutely everything and </v>

143
00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:25.094
<v Speaker 1>this final and horrible judgment that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm placing on the conditions of </v>

144
00:08:27.981 --> 00:08:28.814
<v Speaker 1>existence could conceivably be misplaced</v>
<v Speaker 1>given the sort of presumptuousness of </v>

145
00:08:34.131 --> 00:08:35.480
<v Speaker 1>the claim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

146
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:40.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a position to render final </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgment on the moral value of existence</v>

147
00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:42.740
<v Speaker 1>as such.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me</v>

148
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.313
<v Speaker 1>reasonable to presume that that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of statement that you should </v>

149
00:08:48.471 --> 00:08:53.270
<v Speaker 1>easily make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I remember when George Bush launched</v>

150
00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:56.550
<v Speaker 1>his most recent war?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The initial terminology,</v>

151
00:08:56.551 --> 00:09:01.260
<v Speaker 1>I think this was for the Afghanistan </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle was operation infinite justice,</v>

152
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.500
<v Speaker 1>but he retracted that phrase after a </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of religious leaders objected to.</v>

153
00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:08.304
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of presumptuousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was quite reasonable </v>

154
00:09:10.381 --> 00:09:11.214
<v Speaker 1>because infinite justice is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that most people should probably not </v>

155
00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:15.960
<v Speaker 1>hope for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

156
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.063
<v Speaker 1>Because you never know precisely what </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite justice means because it might </v>

157
00:09:19.561 --> 00:09:23.100
<v Speaker 1>just mean that every bloodied mistake </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've ever made,</v>

158
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:24.083
<v Speaker 1>you're going to pay for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose that would be just as </v>

159
00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:28.860
<v Speaker 1>applicable to George W.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bush as it would to anybody else.</v>

160
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:35.190
<v Speaker 1>And then Milton again describes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>development of this adversarial spirit.</v>

161
00:09:35.191 --> 00:09:36.690
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first pride,</v>

162
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:39.330
<v Speaker 1>pride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and worse ambition threw me down.</v>

163
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.433
<v Speaker 1>That's Satan's lament when he's in hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Milton's description of hell is </v>

164
00:09:43.381 --> 00:09:44.430
<v Speaker 1>extremely interesting.</v>

165
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.830
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason that hell is characterized by</v>

166
00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:50.130
<v Speaker 1>its structure is not so much because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>its nature.</v>

167
00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:50.964
<v Speaker 1>Precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because of its distance from the </v>

168
00:09:52.711 --> 00:09:53.544
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the farther you are away say from </v>

169
00:09:55.951 --> 00:09:59.520
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes the good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more suffering is the more suffering</v>

170
00:09:59.521 --> 00:10:01.520
<v Speaker 1>is endemic to that state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

171
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.590
<v Speaker 1>it's the distance away from something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that constitutes the suffering.</v>

172
00:10:04.591 --> 00:10:05.424
<v Speaker 1>And then Melton says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very interesting to do an analysis </v>

173
00:10:07.621 --> 00:10:10.560
<v Speaker 1>of Satan's character and the notion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell per say,</v>

174
00:10:10.561 --> 00:10:11.394
<v Speaker 1>because how in the world can you </v>
<v Speaker 1>reconcile the idea of a good God with </v>

175
00:10:14.471 --> 00:10:17.610
<v Speaker 1>the notion of this continual suffering?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so Milton says,</v>

176
00:10:17.611 --> 00:10:18.444
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Satan can step out of hell in one </v>

177
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:20.573
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All he has to do is meant that he was </v>

178
00:10:21.541 --> 00:10:22.374
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the one thing that he will </v>

179
00:10:23.491 --> 00:10:26.700
<v Speaker 1>not do under any circumstances </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>

180
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:31.650
<v Speaker 1>So then we put one more twist on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story and we say something like this.</v>

181
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:32.483
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we already know that part of the reason </v>

182
00:10:34.261 --> 00:10:35.094
<v Speaker 1>that people have belief systems is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can structure their </v>

183
00:10:37.231 --> 00:10:39.930
<v Speaker 1>interactions with the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a toolbox.</v>

184
00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Say we're playing a game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we share the rules,</v>

185
00:10:43.081 --> 00:10:44.880
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can cooperate with one another.</v>

186
00:10:44.881 --> 00:10:45.714
<v Speaker 1>It could be other than it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the way it is and it works for </v>

187
00:10:48.511 --> 00:10:49.344
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

188
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.920
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing absolute about it except</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a structure like that's necessary.</v>

189
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:58.110
<v Speaker 1>Now whenever there's a threat to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shared view of the world,</v>

190
00:10:58.111 --> 00:11:00.060
<v Speaker 1>well then we're afraid and for good </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

191
00:11:00.061 --> 00:11:00.894
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not surprising under those </v>

192
00:11:01.981 --> 00:11:05.430
<v Speaker 1>circumstances that we fight to defend </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we've made ours.</v>

193
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:08.820
<v Speaker 1>But then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you adopt this perspective,</v>

194
00:11:08.821 --> 00:11:09.654
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's this vengeful desire to wreak </v>

195
00:11:12.961 --> 00:11:17.100
<v Speaker 1>havoc that extends beyond other </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals and beyond society.</v>

196
00:11:17.101 --> 00:11:20.010
<v Speaker 1>Even to the structure of experience as </v>
<v Speaker 1>such.</v>

197
00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:20.844
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

198
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.710
<v Speaker 1>what's the best mask for that?</v>

199
00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.990
<v Speaker 1>And how do these two processes sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interact?</v>

200
00:11:24.991 --> 00:11:25.824
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

201
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:27.983
<v Speaker 1>the most efficient way to do terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>things is to mask them with the highest </v>

202
00:11:34.081 --> 00:11:34.914
<v Speaker 1>order morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's precisely what the </v>

203
00:11:36.421 --> 00:11:38.940
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that way he gets to have his cake and</v>

204
00:11:38.941 --> 00:11:39.774
<v Speaker 1>eat it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's perfectly well protected from </v>

205
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:42.653
<v Speaker 1>apprehension of the world because his </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief system is complaint plus these </v>

206
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.193
<v Speaker 1>underground motivations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is this constant desire for </v>

207
00:11:49.021 --> 00:11:49.854
<v Speaker 1>revenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can find their expression within the </v>

208
00:11:51.781 --> 00:11:55.420
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian structure and remain </v>
<v Speaker 1>invisible even to himself.</v>

209
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:58.660
<v Speaker 1>So he can say to himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

210
00:11:58.661 --> 00:12:03.661
<v Speaker 1>the reason I threw all those farmers out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their house in 1920 I'm stalled.</v>

211
00:12:03.731 --> 00:12:04.564
<v Speaker 1>Their soup and their food and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandmothers blankets and everything </v>

212
00:12:07.301 --> 00:12:11.410
<v Speaker 1>they'd work to own was because I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>building the socialist paradise.</v>

213
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.333
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was a good thing for me to go </v>

214
00:12:13.871 --> 00:12:14.704
<v Speaker 1>into that house and not a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as long as he believes that or acts </v>

215
00:12:17.831 --> 00:12:18.664
<v Speaker 1>as if he believes that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he can look in the mirror without </v>

216
00:12:20.201 --> 00:12:23.440
<v Speaker 1>screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's no recognition whatsoever of</v>

217
00:12:23.441 --> 00:12:25.660
<v Speaker 1>precisely the sort of game that he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in.</v>

218
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.850
<v Speaker 1>So he has it both ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

219
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:28.833
<v Speaker 1>He can do everything terrible that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>always dreams of doing and consider </v>

220
00:12:31.391 --> 00:12:32.224
<v Speaker 1>himself not only good but good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even at a higher level then the people </v>

221
00:12:37.331 --> 00:12:39.790
<v Speaker 1>that he was actually afflicting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

222
00:12:39.791 --> 00:12:43.240
<v Speaker 1>that's just standard description of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened in the Soviet Union.</v>

223
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:48.863
<v Speaker 1>He just says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love this definition of morality is </v>

224
00:12:52.421 --> 00:12:54.790
<v Speaker 1>the most cynical thing niche ever said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

225
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.153
<v Speaker 1>the idiosyncrasy of decadence with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ulterior motive of revenging oneself </v>

226
00:13:01.481 --> 00:13:06.450
<v Speaker 1>against life successfully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I attach value to this definition said,</v>

227
00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:07.840
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you an idiot log?</v>

228
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:10.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good way to simplify the world,</v>

229
00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:12.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a procrustean bed.</v>

230
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:14.410
<v Speaker 1>You just chop off everything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't fit,</v>

231
00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:16.420
<v Speaker 1>then you don't have to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

232
00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:19.090
<v Speaker 1>So that's good because thinking is </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult and it's trouble.</v>

233
00:13:19.091 --> 00:13:19.924
<v Speaker 1>Someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes courage and so forth to </v>

234
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.860
<v Speaker 1>transform chaos into order is no trivial</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

235
00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:24.843
<v Speaker 1>And if it's all ordered for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then there's really nothing left </v>

236
00:13:26.801 --> 00:13:28.230
<v Speaker 1>for you to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then need,</v>

237
00:13:28.231 --> 00:13:29.950
<v Speaker 1>she goes even below that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

238
00:13:29.951 --> 00:13:30.784
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's more to the story than </v>

239
00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:31.751
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't there?</v>

240
00:13:31.751 --> 00:13:32.584
<v Speaker 1>It's like once he got this little </v>
<v Speaker 1>procrustean bed all arranged for your </v>

241
00:13:35.381 --> 00:13:36.310
<v Speaker 1>enemies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can,</v>

242
00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:41.710
<v Speaker 1>you can allow your most base vengeful </v>
<v Speaker 1>instincts,</v>

243
00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.590
<v Speaker 1>full flow by just continually chopping </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

244
00:13:44.591 --> 00:13:45.424
<v Speaker 1>So they fit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you do it all the while by well </v>

245
00:13:50.201 --> 00:13:51.520
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

246
00:13:51.521 --> 00:13:53.830
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously the best thing that could</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly be done.</v>

247
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:55.953
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

248
00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:03.430
<v Speaker 1>And so then you look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at Stellan say,</v>

249
00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:07.690
<v Speaker 1>because not everybody who's adopted a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vantage full tack on existence,</v>

250
00:14:07.691 --> 00:14:11.830
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like the archetype of </v>
<v Speaker 1>vengefulness or adversarial spirit.</v>

251
00:14:11.831 --> 00:14:14.260
<v Speaker 1>But he had to get now and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like stolen,</v>

252
00:14:14.261 --> 00:14:17.980
<v Speaker 1>who are good counter example say to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like Gandhi and so stones,</v>

253
00:14:17.981 --> 00:14:20.860
<v Speaker 1>very instructive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we could start by looking at what</v>

254
00:14:20.861 --> 00:14:25.861
<v Speaker 1>he did in the Ukraine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at the end of 1929 the Kremlin decree</v>

255
00:14:25.981 --> 00:14:29.110
<v Speaker 1>that millions of peasants from </v>
<v Speaker 1>individually owned farms would be forced</v>

256
00:14:29.111 --> 00:14:33.640
<v Speaker 1>into agricultural collectives or cold </v>
<v Speaker 1>causes seen in the eyes of the politburo</v>

257
00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:34.563
<v Speaker 1>as pliant providers of Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>agricultural needs in defiance of the </v>

258
00:14:38.201 --> 00:14:40.560
<v Speaker 1>facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they did the Ologists,</v>

259
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.080
<v Speaker 1>hammered out inappropriate Marxist </v>
<v Speaker 1>terminology to explain what was going on</v>

260
00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:47.080
<v Speaker 1>throughout grain producing areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was sad.</v>

261
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:48.930
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

262
00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:49.763
<v Speaker 1>Resistance to this scientific scheme was</v>
<v Speaker 1>being by so called rich peasants are </v>

263
00:14:53.391 --> 00:14:56.240
<v Speaker 1>cool acts with his customer of </v>
<v Speaker 1>brutality.</v>

264
00:14:56.241 --> 00:14:57.074
<v Speaker 1>Therefore stellan decreed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>liquidation of the cooler acts as a </v>

265
00:14:59.301 --> 00:15:02.900
<v Speaker 1>class we'll stand in like this idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like group guilt.</v>

266
00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:03.793
<v Speaker 1>That was a major theme for Stalin that </v>
<v Speaker 1>man I really didn't have to ever pay </v>

267
00:15:06.711 --> 00:15:10.010
<v Speaker 1>attention to you as an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could just decide if you were a doctor</v>

268
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:10.933
<v Speaker 1>engineer or a Kulak or a German or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever ethnic racial or educational </v>

269
00:15:16.251 --> 00:15:17.084
<v Speaker 1>division happened to characterize my </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular target at the time and it </v>

270
00:15:19.491 --> 00:15:22.280
<v Speaker 1>didn't matter if you were guilty as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

271
00:15:22.281 --> 00:15:24.900
<v Speaker 1>That whole notion never even obtained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was class guilt.</v>

272
00:15:24.901 --> 00:15:27.260
<v Speaker 1>It mattered and if you were in one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those classes as well,</v>

273
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:28.143
<v Speaker 1>we are better without you and of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>the nature of the class just changed </v>

274
00:15:30.741 --> 00:15:31.574
<v Speaker 1>constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was perfectly logical thing to </v>

275
00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:35.600
<v Speaker 1>think if you believed in like historical</v>
<v Speaker 1>determinism.</v>

276
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.793
<v Speaker 1>If your parents were rich version law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the probability that you are </v>

277
00:15:39.471 --> 00:15:42.650
<v Speaker 1>going to be a useful part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>workers' collective bs?</v>

278
00:15:42.651 --> 00:15:43.484
<v Speaker 1>You're just to get rid of you ahead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time so you didn't cause too much </v>

279
00:15:45.501 --> 00:15:46.334
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you think about these kulaks </v>

280
00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:49.364
<v Speaker 1>rich peasants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well who are these people like when we </v>

281
00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:56.351
<v Speaker 1>get down to the individual level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you go on village village was full of</v>

282
00:15:57.321 --> 00:15:58.154
<v Speaker 1>surfs like not 40 years before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are people just struggling out </v>

283
00:16:00.651 --> 00:16:01.940
<v Speaker 1>of the feudal society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

284
00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.013
<v Speaker 1>And you got some people in there who've </v>
<v Speaker 1>managed to be successful enough as </v>

285
00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:06.464
<v Speaker 1>farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is no easy thing to like have a </v>

286
00:16:07.941 --> 00:16:10.460
<v Speaker 1>house and maybe hire one person and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

287
00:16:10.461 --> 00:16:11.294
<v Speaker 1>maybe have a little extra food in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>larder and a few kind of material </v>

288
00:16:15.591 --> 00:16:17.660
<v Speaker 1>possessions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are successful people.</v>

289
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.910
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they're the ones that actually knew</v>

290
00:16:19.911 --> 00:16:21.620
<v Speaker 1>how to farm to one theory.</v>

291
00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.950
<v Speaker 1>Or You could say the reason they had all</v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff was cause they stoled it from</v>

292
00:16:24.951 --> 00:16:26.090
<v Speaker 1>all the other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

293
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:27.141
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

294
00:16:27.141 --> 00:16:30.380
<v Speaker 1>so I marched into town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a Soviet revolutionary and I say,</v>

295
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:33.650
<v Speaker 1>hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know those rich people,</v>

296
00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.420
<v Speaker 1>they stoled everything they have from </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

297
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:36.740
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

298
00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:38.780
<v Speaker 1>which of you guys is going to listen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

299
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.123
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to be the sort of </v>

300
00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:43.910
<v Speaker 1>struggling people just underneath them </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are really trying to get ahead,</v>

301
00:16:43.911 --> 00:16:44.744
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's where they're hoping to </v>

302
00:16:45.291 --> 00:16:46.460
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be.</v>

303
00:16:46.461 --> 00:16:49.490
<v Speaker 1>They're resentful and revengeful few who</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

304
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:50.503
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is fundamentally unfair and </v>

305
00:16:51.651 --> 00:16:52.484
<v Speaker 1>it's obvious that those sons of bitches </v>
<v Speaker 1>got what they want by stealing it from </v>

306
00:16:54.921 --> 00:16:55.754
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here it turns out that if I just go </v>

307
00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.170
<v Speaker 1>down the street and steal it back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well not only,</v>

308
00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:01.573
<v Speaker 1>not only am I allowed to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but according to this new and emergent </v>

309
00:17:04.261 --> 00:17:05.660
<v Speaker 1>ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

310
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.360
<v Speaker 1>that's the best thing I could possibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

311
00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:09.403
<v Speaker 1>So then multiply that story by several </v>
<v Speaker 1>million participants and you have like </v>

312
00:17:13.101 --> 00:17:15.410
<v Speaker 1>the first five years of the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>Empire.</v>

313
00:17:15.411 --> 00:17:16.244
<v Speaker 1>And so what do we have there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The result was a catastrophic onslaught </v>

314
00:17:19.251 --> 00:17:20.084
<v Speaker 1>on millions of peasant households at </v>
<v Speaker 1>first party activists and local </v>

315
00:17:23.301 --> 00:17:25.970
<v Speaker 1>officials read bullies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

316
00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.253
<v Speaker 1>Brutalized hesitance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forcing them to surrender their </v>

317
00:17:28.821 --> 00:17:31.250
<v Speaker 1>homesteads and their possessions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deportations,</v>

318
00:17:31.251 --> 00:17:33.470
<v Speaker 1>arrests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and killing soon followed as terror,</v>

319
00:17:33.471 --> 00:17:34.304
<v Speaker 1>generalized the violence mounted to full</v>
<v Speaker 1>scale rebellion in various places with </v>

320
00:17:38.841 --> 00:17:41.600
<v Speaker 1>regular troops engaged for months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

321
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:46.640
<v Speaker 1>suppressing peasant uprisings resistance</v>
<v Speaker 1>took various forms,</v>

322
00:17:46.641 --> 00:17:50.670
<v Speaker 1>usually reflecting the hopeless </v>
<v Speaker 1>desperate anguish of a population in the</v>

323
00:17:50.671 --> 00:17:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were even women's rebellions,</v>

324
00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:53.813
<v Speaker 1>spontaneous uprisings of peasant women </v>
<v Speaker 1>who attack the local Coco's is Tibet </v>

325
00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:58.283
<v Speaker 1>demand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The return of confiscated farm products </v>

326
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.990
<v Speaker 1>with a colossal impact on the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>

327
00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:09.290
<v Speaker 1>Peasants slaughtered their animals by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the millions rather than see them seized</v>

328
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:10.260
<v Speaker 1>for two years.</v>

329
00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.093
<v Speaker 1>The fighting raged as the dreadful </v>
<v Speaker 1>process of deep cooler conization </v>

330
00:18:14.941 --> 00:18:15.774
<v Speaker 1>continued Stella in order to further </v>
<v Speaker 1>assault on the recalcitrant peasantry </v>

331
00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:24.020
<v Speaker 1>what conquest calls the terror famine of</v>
<v Speaker 1>1932 Moscow rights conquest.</v>

332
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:27.780
<v Speaker 1>It's from a book called the harvest of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorrow.</v>

333
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:29.933
<v Speaker 1>Knowingly decreed grain poker </v>
<v Speaker 1>procurements from Ukraine and elsewhere </v>

334
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:36.180
<v Speaker 1>exceeding by far with the local </v>
<v Speaker 1>population could produce right,</v>

335
00:18:36.181 --> 00:18:37.014
<v Speaker 1>which meant that everyone who lived </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was forced in ordered to deliver </v>

336
00:18:39.841 --> 00:18:40.674
<v Speaker 1>more grain than they had ever grown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Communists Brigades roam the </v>

337
00:18:44.311 --> 00:18:45.144
<v Speaker 1>countryside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forcing agriculturalist to discourage </v>

338
00:18:46.741 --> 00:18:50.280
<v Speaker 1>the little they had been able to produce</v>
<v Speaker 1>under conditions of severe dislocation.</v>

339
00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:54.860
<v Speaker 1>Grain sat unused in state reserves while</v>
<v Speaker 1>the local population starved.</v>

340
00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:04.180
<v Speaker 1>This is from wisdom park riffle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Biblical writings</v>

341
00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:10.860
<v Speaker 1>before they reasoned unsoundly saying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves short and Sora for all is our</v>

342
00:19:11.261 --> 00:19:12.094
<v Speaker 1>life and there is no remedy when a man </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to his end and no one has been </v>

343
00:19:14.831 --> 00:19:15.664
<v Speaker 1>known to return from Haiti's because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were born by mere chance and hereafter </v>

344
00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:20.284
<v Speaker 1>we shall be as though we had never been </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the breath in our nostrils is </v>

345
00:19:23.141 --> 00:19:26.620
<v Speaker 1>smoke and reason a spark kindled by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beating of our hearts.</v>

346
00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:27.723
<v Speaker 1>When it is extinguished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body will turn to ashes and the </v>

347
00:19:29.531 --> 00:19:30.364
<v Speaker 1>spirit will dissolve like empty air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our Name will be forgotten in time and </v>

348
00:19:34.571 --> 00:19:35.404
<v Speaker 1>no one will remember our works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our life will pass away like the traces </v>

349
00:19:38.111 --> 00:19:38.944
<v Speaker 1>of a cloud and be scattered like mist </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is chased by the rays of the sun </v>

350
00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:42.933
<v Speaker 1>and overcome by its heat for our </v>
<v Speaker 1>allotted time is the passing of the </v>

351
00:19:46.061 --> 00:19:46.780
<v Speaker 1>shadow.</v>

352
00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:50.680
<v Speaker 1>And there no return from our death </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it is sealed up and no one turns</v>

353
00:19:50.681 --> 00:19:55.210
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a piece of writing thousands of years</v>

354
00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:56.043
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so Nisha says at the end of the 19 </v>

355
00:19:56.951 --> 00:19:57.784
<v Speaker 1>hundreds well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rationality undermines our faith and </v>

356
00:19:59.201 --> 00:20:00.034
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have a piece of writing from </v>

357
00:20:01.271 --> 00:20:03.760
<v Speaker 1>more than 2000 years ago that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

358
00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:08.200
<v Speaker 1>what is it about being alive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's short and there's nothing to it,</v>

359
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:09.063
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our thoughts are biologically produced </v>

360
00:20:11.231 --> 00:20:12.880
<v Speaker 1>and when we die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing left.</v>

361
00:20:12.881 --> 00:20:14.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very modern thought.</v>

362
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was expressed thousands of years ago.</v>

363
00:20:17.021 --> 00:20:20.270
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think merely from observing that,</v>

364
00:20:20.271 --> 00:20:21.104
<v Speaker 1>that the crisis of faith that </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterizes modern society is a </v>

365
00:20:24.281 --> 00:20:28.210
<v Speaker 1>reflection of the permanent crisis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>faith that characterizes human beings.</v>

366
00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:29.883
<v Speaker 1>What's happening with the totalitarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while the totalitarian is afraid of the </v>

367
00:20:33.581 --> 00:20:35.830
<v Speaker 1>unknown for good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for good reason.</v>

368
00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:36.813
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's very interested in sustaining </v>

369
00:20:39.791 --> 00:20:41.260
<v Speaker 1>his own belief structure.</v>

370
00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:42.843
<v Speaker 1>And the combination of those two things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can start off trivially is that the </v>

371
00:20:46.511 --> 00:20:47.344
<v Speaker 1>more convinced that you have to maintain</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stability of your current belief </v>

372
00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:54.020
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more afraid you are of going to have</v>

373
00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:55.413
<v Speaker 1>anything that's unknown and the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid you are of anything that's </v>

374
00:20:58.091 --> 00:20:58.924
<v Speaker 1>unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the less likely you are to go out and </v>

375
00:21:00.161 --> 00:21:00.994
<v Speaker 1>explore it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the less likely you already go </v>

376
00:21:02.441 --> 00:21:03.274
<v Speaker 1>out and explore it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weaker you get cause you start </v>

377
00:21:04.571 --> 00:21:08.560
<v Speaker 1>gathering information and then the week </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you get the more necessary it is that</v>

378
00:21:08.561 --> 00:21:10.350
<v Speaker 1>you have to have this frame of reference</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

379
00:21:10.351 --> 00:21:14.920
<v Speaker 1>it has to remain intact and this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing starts to cycle and cycle.</v>

380
00:21:14.921 --> 00:21:15.754
<v Speaker 1>So you undermine your own sense of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own autonomy and ability and you make </v>

381
00:21:19.031 --> 00:21:19.864
<v Speaker 1>yourself more and more a rigid tool of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the propagandistic system and you're </v>

382
00:21:23.621 --> 00:21:28.150
<v Speaker 1>more and more adopt the stance of enmity</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards anything you don't understand.</v>

383
00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:32.710
<v Speaker 1>And that's a spiral that goes rapidly </v>
<v Speaker 1>downhill right rapidly into a state.</v>

384
00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.890
<v Speaker 1>It's characterized by complete internal </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

385
00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:37.763
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a good definition of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what is meant in metaphysical language </v>

386
00:21:40.961 --> 00:21:43.420
<v Speaker 1>by hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hell is a bottomless pit.</v>

387
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.980
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

388
00:21:44.981 --> 00:21:47.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't care how bad things are for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>or around you.</v>

389
00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.530
<v Speaker 1>There's always some bloody thing you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could do to make it worse,</v>

390
00:21:50.531 --> 00:21:51.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always some suffering.</v>

391
00:21:51.851 --> 00:21:52.684
<v Speaker 1>You can extend others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always some bit of stubbornness </v>

392
00:21:54.701 --> 00:21:55.534
<v Speaker 1>or rejection that you can pull off </v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll make your already terrible </v>

393
00:21:57.701 --> 00:21:58.990
<v Speaker 1>situation worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

394
00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.020
<v Speaker 1>So there's no bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that seems to me to be right.</v>

395
00:22:02.021 --> 00:22:02.854
<v Speaker 1>If he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do just a cursory historical </v>

396
00:22:04.331 --> 00:22:05.164
<v Speaker 1>analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what terrible account you can </v>

397
00:22:07.511 --> 00:22:09.970
<v Speaker 1>come across with regards to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration,</v>

398
00:22:09.971 --> 00:22:13.750
<v Speaker 1>camp brutality in some other book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some worst story,</v>

399
00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:16.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Limited only by the absolute,</v>

400
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:20.380
<v Speaker 1>the absolute ends of the most brutal </v>
<v Speaker 1>form of imagination.</v>

401
00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.960
<v Speaker 1>All a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of this process,</v>

402
00:22:22.961 --> 00:22:23.794
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can't really say what causes it </v>

403
00:22:25.511 --> 00:22:29.290
<v Speaker 1>because on the one hand there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>cowardice and lack of faith,</v>

404
00:22:29.291 --> 00:22:30.124
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything I don't understand powered his </v>

405
00:22:32.711 --> 00:22:33.544
<v Speaker 1>pride in lack of faith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything I don't understand doesn't </v>

406
00:22:35.501 --> 00:22:36.334
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus I'm not the person to confront it </v>

407
00:22:38.051 --> 00:22:38.884
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

408
00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:39.903
<v Speaker 1>That's the lack of faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each of those things feeds into the </v>

409
00:22:43.061 --> 00:22:45.730
<v Speaker 1>other and it's very difficult to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it starts.</v>

410
00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:49.523
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

411
00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:51.643
<v Speaker 1>The thing that's kind of interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the self referential processes is </v>

412
00:22:54.081 --> 00:22:57.740
<v Speaker 1>that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to start dramatically.</v>

413
00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Like the loop can start very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very small and it picks up speed very,</v>

414
00:23:02.721 --> 00:23:03.554
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you imagine you're speaking into a </v>

415
00:23:05.751 --> 00:23:06.584
<v Speaker 1>tape recorder and the speakers on you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get too close to the speaker with the </v>

416
00:23:10.041 --> 00:23:13.130
<v Speaker 1>microphone and you get some feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you bring the microphone a little</v>

417
00:23:13.131 --> 00:23:13.964
<v Speaker 1>closer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feedback develops more and more </v>

418
00:23:14.991 --> 00:23:16.070
<v Speaker 1>intensely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can blow up.</v>

419
00:23:16.071 --> 00:23:21.071
<v Speaker 1>The whole system doesn't have to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatically to move forward very,</v>

420
00:23:21.291 --> 00:23:23.540
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means,</v>

421
00:23:23.541 --> 00:23:24.374
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that even small mistakes anywhere </v>

422
00:23:26.961 --> 00:23:27.794
<v Speaker 1>along this circle can start the </v>
<v Speaker 1>development of precisely this kind of </v>

423
00:23:31.941 --> 00:23:32.960
<v Speaker 1>spiral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you'll say,</v>

424
00:23:32.961 --> 00:23:33.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people do,</v>

425
00:23:33.831 --> 00:23:37.280
<v Speaker 1>people need to be abused to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian.</v>

426
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the answer to that is no,</v>

427
00:23:38.661 --> 00:23:43.280
<v Speaker 1>because everyone's been abused </v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently by Samo currencies in their</v>

428
00:23:43.281 --> 00:23:47.240
<v Speaker 1>life to justify taking negative tack on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the nature of experience.</v>

429
00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:47.811
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

430
00:23:47.811 --> 00:23:51.200
<v Speaker 1>how cowardly do you have to be in order </v>
<v Speaker 1>to run away from things?</v>

431
00:23:51.201 --> 00:23:51.711
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

432
00:23:51.711 --> 00:23:56.390
<v Speaker 1>not that cowardly because under most </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances your life is characterized</v>

433
00:23:56.391 --> 00:23:57.740
<v Speaker 1>by sins of omission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

434
00:23:57.741 --> 00:23:58.574
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are things you left on done and </v>

435
00:24:01.071 --> 00:24:05.270
<v Speaker 1>like how just exactly how rigid do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want your belief systems to be?</v>

436
00:24:05.271 --> 00:24:06.260
<v Speaker 1>And you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

437
00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.990
<v Speaker 1>I like them to be stable because without</v>
<v Speaker 1>that stability,</v>

438
00:24:08.991 --> 00:24:11.540
<v Speaker 1>then I'm terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can say,</v>

439
00:24:11.541 --> 00:24:13.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair enough,</v>

440
00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.800
<v Speaker 1>but that's all a sign of a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>existential weakness.</v>

441
00:24:15.801 --> 00:24:19.850
<v Speaker 1>And then if social circumstances come </v>
<v Speaker 1>around and give your life a good tweak,</v>

442
00:24:19.851 --> 00:24:22.310
<v Speaker 1>say like they did with the Germans prior</v>
<v Speaker 1>to World War II,</v>

443
00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:24.950
<v Speaker 1>you just never know what side you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to end up on.</v>

444
00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.590
<v Speaker 1>And so all these little tiny mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

445
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:28.873
<v Speaker 1>mistakes that I think are marked by your</v>
<v Speaker 1>own conscious are precisely that leads </v>

446
00:24:31.881 --> 00:24:33.290
<v Speaker 1>you down this terrible path.</v>

447
00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:34.371
<v Speaker 1>And if you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

448
00:24:34.371 --> 00:24:35.720
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can't be right.</v>

449
00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:38.630
<v Speaker 1>Well then you have to remember that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>these processes,</v>

450
00:24:38.631 --> 00:24:39.464
<v Speaker 1>say of d Kula causation and that immense</v>
<v Speaker 1>wave of desks that characterize the </v>

451
00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Nazi Germany,</v>

452
00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:48.350
<v Speaker 1>most people were involved and if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't involved,</v>

453
00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:49.933
<v Speaker 1>indirect acts of commission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were absolutely involved in direct </v>

454
00:24:53.691 --> 00:24:54.890
<v Speaker 1>acts of omission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

455
00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.500
<v Speaker 1>They knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't say anything.</v>

456
00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:59.203
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>classically sins of commission or </v>

457
00:25:00.951 --> 00:25:03.650
<v Speaker 1>regarded as much more evil say than sins</v>
<v Speaker 1>of omission.</v>

458
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:04.663
<v Speaker 1>But I actually think that's backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sins of omission are worse because </v>

459
00:25:07.761 --> 00:25:12.640
<v Speaker 1>every time you walk away and what do you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do when you walk away from a Nazi?</v>

460
00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:14.680
<v Speaker 1>What are you walking away from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

461
00:25:14.681 --> 00:25:16.780
<v Speaker 1>we know what you're walking away from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

462
00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:17.763
<v Speaker 1>If you're walking away from</v>
<v Speaker 1>a domain that's likely to expand into </v>

463
00:25:21.931 --> 00:25:26.931
<v Speaker 1>something that's completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>undifferentiatable from hell and it's no</v>

464
00:25:28.531 --> 00:25:29.364
<v Speaker 1>wonder you'd walk away from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that you walk away from it </v>

465
00:25:32.281 --> 00:25:34.140
<v Speaker 1>makes it much more likely that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to happen.</v>

466
00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:36.110
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

467
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:39.080
<v Speaker 1>so then I think to end this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like this,</v>

468
00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:41.210
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

469
00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:44.360
<v Speaker 1>we look for economic reasons to explain </v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

470
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:46.040
<v Speaker 1>terrible acts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

471
00:25:46.041 --> 00:25:49.400
<v Speaker 1>We look for social reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we look for political reasons,</v>

472
00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:51.350
<v Speaker 1>but we have niches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>observation,</v>

473
00:25:51.351 --> 00:25:52.184
<v Speaker 1>which is something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care whether or not your life's </v>

474
00:25:54.801 --> 00:25:57.110
<v Speaker 1>been characterized by suffering and </v>
<v Speaker 1>deprivation.</v>

475
00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:00.800
<v Speaker 1>The mere fact of suffering and </v>
<v Speaker 1>deprivation does not allow you to draw a</v>

476
00:26:00.801 --> 00:26:04.040
<v Speaker 1>particular conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't say that there's a causal path</v>

477
00:26:04.041 --> 00:26:04.874
<v Speaker 1>between economic deprivation say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the rise of a totalitarian state </v>

478
00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.880
<v Speaker 1>because any events susceptible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple interpretations.</v>

479
00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:12.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do these states come about?</v>

480
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:14.001
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

481
00:26:14.001 --> 00:26:14.834
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we look for political and economic and </v>

482
00:26:15.951 --> 00:26:19.370
<v Speaker 1>social reasons because that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>easiest place to look,</v>

483
00:26:19.371 --> 00:26:20.204
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you ratchet up the level of </v>

484
00:26:21.471 --> 00:26:24.710
<v Speaker 1>description to social forces that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond your control,</v>

485
00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:25.693
<v Speaker 1>then you never have to worry about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that you're doing or not doing </v>

486
00:26:27.711 --> 00:26:29.420
<v Speaker 1>this actually causing this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

487
00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:32.060
<v Speaker 1>But I think if you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>historical record,</v>

488
00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:35.240
<v Speaker 1>especially if you look at it from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological perspective,</v>

489
00:26:35.241 --> 00:26:38.810
<v Speaker 1>the stories basically clear and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes something like this.</v>

490
00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:43.960
<v Speaker 1>Every time you make a mistake that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know is a mistake and you don't fix it,</v>

491
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:48.930
<v Speaker 1>the world moves more towards that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it might be trivial maybe,</v>

492
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.690
<v Speaker 1>but it might not be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you look at Adolf Eichmann,</v>

493
00:26:51.691 --> 00:26:53.940
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is the little bureaucrat who planned</v>

494
00:26:53.941 --> 00:26:58.110
<v Speaker 1>the final solution and you find out he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just your little ratty guy,</v>

495
00:26:58.111 --> 00:26:59.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see him in a bar.</v>

496
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.850
<v Speaker 1>You don't even notice him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a negligible nobody.</v>

497
00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:06.120
<v Speaker 1>But he's the guy who planned the final </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution.</v>

498
00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:08.370
<v Speaker 1>He was a normal person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

499
00:27:08.371 --> 00:27:11.010
<v Speaker 1>maybe even slightly less than normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

500
00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:12.383
<v Speaker 1>He was no monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't the sort of person you'd </v>

501
00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.770
<v Speaker 1>remark on if you saw him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Precisely the opposite.</v>

502
00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Invisible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quiet,</v>

503
00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:21.060
<v Speaker 1>unassuming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>presuming.</v>

504
00:27:21.061 --> 00:27:21.894
<v Speaker 1>No doubt that at least until he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrested that he was just doing what he </v>

505
00:27:25.381 --> 00:27:27.720
<v Speaker 1>was told.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was just fine.</v>
