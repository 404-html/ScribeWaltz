1
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.220
<v Speaker 1>Looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>like</v>

2
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.280
<v Speaker 1>everybody's here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For those of you who were,</v>

3
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.860
<v Speaker 1>so does everybody have a copy of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I rewrote.</v>

4
00:01:13.861 --> 00:01:16.220
<v Speaker 1>I'd been rewriting the introduction to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this bearing script.</v>

5
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.900
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do do.</v>

6
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.533
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned to you before that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of techniques for writing an </v>

7
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:30.820
<v Speaker 1>essay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the essay that you should put aside what</v>

8
00:01:30.821 --> 00:01:35.280
<v Speaker 1>you wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do that all the time.</v>

9
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.750
<v Speaker 1>So what you have here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see,</v>

10
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.300
<v Speaker 1>in terms of payment</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the first page,</v>

11
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.380
<v Speaker 1>1616 and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff you've already read,</v>

12
00:01:50.381 --> 00:01:51.214
<v Speaker 1>it's hopefully written more clearly but </v>
<v Speaker 1>from 17 and a half to the end of 18 is </v>

13
00:01:56.911 --> 00:01:59.430
<v Speaker 1>actually an outline of the argument in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole book.</v>

14
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:01.703
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will provide the transition to the </v>

15
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:09.300
<v Speaker 1>second part of the course which starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

16
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:12.723
<v Speaker 1>I tried to start the last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had a hard time because I wasn't </v>

17
00:02:14.641 --> 00:02:15.474
<v Speaker 1>in the right sort of mood to discuss the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of material and also because I've </v>

18
00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:22.530
<v Speaker 1>been working on the first half of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>manuscript for about a year.</v>

19
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.350
<v Speaker 1>I spent the previous year working on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>second half,</v>

20
00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:26.184
<v Speaker 1>but a year ago was a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I forgotten a lot of what I was </v>

21
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:30.563
<v Speaker 1>trying to say and it was really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took more effort than I was willing </v>

22
00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:34.164
<v Speaker 1>to engage him last week and the week </v>
<v Speaker 1>before to make sense of the chapter or </v>

23
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.350
<v Speaker 1>contamination of the experience with </v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

24
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.273
<v Speaker 1>I mean what I'm trying to do in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>chapter is to describe the difference </v>

25
00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:48.114
<v Speaker 1>between consciousness and self </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and also to portray how </v>

26
00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:58.800
<v Speaker 1>mythology represents the consequences of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the emergence of self consciousness.</v>

27
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 1>And I want to do that for a particular</v>

28
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.083
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not because I'm really necessarily </v>

29
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:07.111
<v Speaker 2>all that interested in that as a topic </v>
<v Speaker 2>is sort of a precursor to discussing why</v>

30
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:11.520
<v Speaker 2>it is that we differ in our emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>response was from animals.</v>

31
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.363
<v Speaker 2>Why our emotional response to that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think are are more heightened and also </v>

32
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:16.990
<v Speaker 2>maybe why do we were actually more </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious.</v>

33
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 2>So it's a lot of background work to </v>
<v Speaker 2>describe that.</v>

34
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:24.603
<v Speaker 2>Trying to figure out how self </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness differs from </v>

35
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's difficult.</v>

36
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 2>That's a difficult procedure in and of </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>

37
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.690
<v Speaker 2>let alone when it's just the basis of </v>
<v Speaker 2>another argument.</v>

38
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.040
<v Speaker 2>So let's go over the outline of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>manuscript and hopefully that help clear</v>

39
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:44.524
<v Speaker 2>up in your minds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of the things that I've been </v>

40
00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:49.840
<v Speaker 2>discussing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can me help clear them up your mind,</v>

41
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:51.070
<v Speaker 2>mind?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

42
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.900
<v Speaker 2>so this is the basic argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll really can be construed as a forum</v>

43
00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:58.750
<v Speaker 2>for action as well as a place for </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

44
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 2>I want you to discuss that and be ready.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

45
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.243
<v Speaker 2>well scientific methodology constitutes </v>
<v Speaker 2>the formal process whereby we described </v>

46
00:04:07.351 --> 00:04:10.060
<v Speaker 2>the world as a place of things </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative.</v>

47
00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:11.500
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>myth,</v>

48
00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:14.980
<v Speaker 2>literature and drama portrays the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a forum for action.</v>

49
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.290
<v Speaker 2>The two forms of description had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>unnecessarily set it odd because we have</v>

50
00:04:20.291 --> 00:04:23.260
<v Speaker 2>not yet for the clear picture of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>respective domains.</v>

51
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.203
<v Speaker 2>The domain of the former that is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world as a place of things is what is </v>

52
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.910
<v Speaker 2>from the perspective of interest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>subjective perception,</v>

53
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.003
<v Speaker 2>so we can get a description of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>objective status of things by comparing </v>

54
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:38.944
<v Speaker 2>a perceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the domain of the ladder as the domain </v>

55
00:04:43.731 --> 00:04:46.880
<v Speaker 2>of pathology describing the world as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>forum for action</v>

56
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.253
<v Speaker 2>is what he is and what should be from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the perspective of emotion than the </v>

57
00:04:52.951 --> 00:04:53.784
<v Speaker 2>action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see why those two things would </v>

58
00:04:56.081 --> 00:04:56.914
<v Speaker 2>have been confused because both in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense are an attempt to describe what </v>

59
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:00.683
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although myth also with to describe one </v>

60
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.790
<v Speaker 2>should be and you can describe what is </v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of its implications for you and</v>

61
00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:09.550
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a perfectly valid approach.</v>

62
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:10.563
<v Speaker 2>Or You could describe what he is from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the perspective of objective </v>

63
00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:14.374
<v Speaker 2>description,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also a valid approach because </v>

64
00:05:17.141 --> 00:05:20.200
<v Speaker 2>in both cases you're engaged in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>process that looks similar.</v>

65
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.543
<v Speaker 2>It's easy to confuse one form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>description and its purposes with the </v>

66
00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:25.571
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would say,</v>

67
00:05:25.571 --> 00:05:26.404
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's being basically that confusion </v>

68
00:05:28.421 --> 00:05:29.254
<v Speaker 2>has led to the dissociation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific knowledge from from moral </v>

69
00:05:34.151 --> 00:05:34.984
<v Speaker 2>knowledge or for mythological going one </v>
<v Speaker 2>gen chem two they're unnecessary </v>

70
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.973
<v Speaker 2>opposition.</v>

71
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.093
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

72
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.033
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

73
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.873
<v Speaker 2>either they're both valid and we don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand how that can be or one's </v>

74
00:05:47.121 --> 00:05:51.740
<v Speaker 2>valid than the other isn't and it looks </v>
<v Speaker 2>like all the evidence suggests that it's</v>

75
00:05:51.741 --> 00:05:52.574
<v Speaker 2>scientific if one's valid than the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>is all the evidence suggests that the </v>

76
00:05:55.371 --> 00:05:56.204
<v Speaker 2>scientific knowledge it's smell seems a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit unreasonable given that all human </v>

77
00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:01.323
<v Speaker 2>conscious up to the European culture </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially 500 years ago lived </v>

78
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 2>according to the mythological </v>
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions.</v>

79
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:08.463
<v Speaker 2>We get pure science sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We also have a lot of my clinical </v>

80
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:13.994
<v Speaker 2>psychology and in any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in any in designs we talk about basic </v>

81
00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:20.350
<v Speaker 2>research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also applications.</v>

82
00:06:20.351 --> 00:06:23.780
<v Speaker 2>A sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talking about that second domain.</v>

83
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.380
<v Speaker 2>I would say absolutely science is </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningless if it doesn't imply what you</v>

84
00:06:27.381 --> 00:06:28.214
<v Speaker 2>should do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the application of science </v>

85
00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:29.954
<v Speaker 2>necessarily implies that you should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would say as soon as you're </v>

86
00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:35.030
<v Speaker 2>applying science to what should be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not science anymore.</v>

87
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:36.283
<v Speaker 2>I guess since it's side it's it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>mythology that's operating under the </v>

88
00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:39.974
<v Speaker 2>guise of science and this all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>explains for me at least why for </v>

89
00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:45.500
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>

90
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.393
<v Speaker 2>I teach personality course though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's endless numbers of competing </v>

91
00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:49.784
<v Speaker 2>personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's many of them predicated on </v>

92
00:06:51.291 --> 00:06:52.124
<v Speaker 2>completely different presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all provide a coherent story more </v>

93
00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.760
<v Speaker 2>or less fairly coherent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a matter of fact,</v>

94
00:06:58.761 --> 00:06:59.594
<v Speaker 2>even though they don't agree and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth of the matter appears to be that </v>

95
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.553
<v Speaker 2>if you're a therapist and you pick any </v>
<v Speaker 2>of those stories and you apply it </v>

96
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.443
<v Speaker 2>according to the rules of that story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it works about as well as any other </v>

97
00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:12.194
<v Speaker 2>store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean people don't like to admit that </v>

98
00:07:13.011 --> 00:07:16.460
<v Speaker 2>if their adherence of one theory or </v>
<v Speaker 2>another and behaviorism seems to be good</v>

99
00:07:16.461 --> 00:07:20.240
<v Speaker 2>for per some specify things better than </v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps some other doctors,</v>

100
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:24.740
<v Speaker 2>but I think you can understand that not </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a scientific perspective.</v>

101
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.910
<v Speaker 2>So watch us from the perspective of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mythology which is to say that if you've</v>

102
00:07:28.911 --> 00:07:32.840
<v Speaker 2>come to therapy and you have no story </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever,</v>

103
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.393
<v Speaker 2>the provision of a coherent story for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you is already an improvement over your </v>

104
00:07:38.331 --> 00:07:39.164
<v Speaker 2>current status even though you might not</v>
<v Speaker 2>be being exposed to the basketball </v>

105
00:07:41.601 --> 00:07:44.750
<v Speaker 2>possible story so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'd also say that</v>

106
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.113
<v Speaker 2>this is part of the reason why there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>such a problem in constructing </v>

107
00:07:49.731 --> 00:07:50.564
<v Speaker 2>psychiatric classifications from liberal</v>
<v Speaker 2>illness cause they're not scientific at </v>

108
00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:57.080
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of them is some conception </v>
<v Speaker 2>implicit or explicit.</v>

109
00:07:57.081 --> 00:08:02.081
<v Speaker 2>It's implicit in the DSM by design about</v>
<v Speaker 2>what constitutes mental health.</v>

110
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:03.613
<v Speaker 2>Because you have to define your own is </v>
<v Speaker 2>in contrast to hell and as soon as you </v>

111
00:08:06.621 --> 00:08:09.110
<v Speaker 2>start talking about health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's mental or otherwise,</v>

112
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.180
<v Speaker 2>you're not in the objective domain </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

113
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.820
<v Speaker 2>You have to make judgments about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pumpkin to the ideals.</v>

114
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:15.103
<v Speaker 2>And I think this is part of the problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>that psychiatric diagnosis has has not </v>

115
00:08:19.461 --> 00:08:20.294
<v Speaker 2>dealt with explorer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's part of the problem with </v>

116
00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:25.520
<v Speaker 2>psychiatric diagnosis in general and has</v>
<v Speaker 2>a problem.</v>

117
00:08:25.521 --> 00:08:27.410
<v Speaker 2>It's generally not dealt with </v>
<v Speaker 2>explicitly,</v>

118
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.233
<v Speaker 2>so if it's an applied science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pulling in some mythological </v>

119
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:32.973
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's any way around </v>

120
00:08:35.391 --> 00:08:36.470
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we just have to,</v>

121
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.540
<v Speaker 2>we have to recognize that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>case.</v>

122
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.903
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have the world as a place of </v>

123
00:08:45.861 --> 00:08:47.870
<v Speaker 2>things in the world is a forum for </v>
<v Speaker 2>action</v>

124
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.510
<v Speaker 2>as a forum for action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It appears to be composed of two,</v>

125
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.100
<v Speaker 2>the three constituent elements that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've discussed in detail,</v>

126
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:56.783
<v Speaker 2>unexplored territory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>explored territory and the process that </v>

127
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:05.600
<v Speaker 2>mediates between the two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you analyze the characteristics,</v>

128
00:09:05.601 --> 00:09:10.320
<v Speaker 2>emotional responses of the human brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that analysis reveals that the brain has</v>

129
00:09:10.321 --> 00:09:15.030
<v Speaker 2>adapted itself to the world as a forum </v>
<v Speaker 2>for action as well as place of things.</v>

130
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:16.733
<v Speaker 2>This implies to me the fact that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological adaptation implies that the </v>

131
00:09:19.501 --> 00:09:21.950
<v Speaker 2>environment is in reality a form for </v>
<v Speaker 2>actions.</v>

132
00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.870
<v Speaker 2>We'll also place for things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that implies mean if you,</v>

133
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:30.030
<v Speaker 2>if you buy the argument that adaptation </v>
<v Speaker 2>does take place to the environment.</v>

134
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.900
<v Speaker 2>If we've adapted to the environment as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>forum for action,</v>

135
00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:34.734
<v Speaker 2>then it applies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The descriptions of the world as a form </v>

136
00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:39.630
<v Speaker 2>for action are in fact descriptions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's real.</v>

137
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.593
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a strange idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it still strikes me as as if you </v>

138
00:09:49.141 --> 00:09:52.350
<v Speaker 2>accept that preset positions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that's a necessary conclusion.</v>

139
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:54.143
<v Speaker 2>Each of the three constituent elements </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world as a four for action has a </v>

140
00:09:56.581 --> 00:09:57.414
<v Speaker 2>characteristic nature or personality and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has garnered mythological or </v>

141
00:10:00.661 --> 00:10:02.790
<v Speaker 2>narrative representations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As such,</v>

142
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.320
<v Speaker 2>these representations have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>structural aspect of natural categories</v>

143
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:12.240
<v Speaker 2>and appear relatively stable across </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural place in time.</v>

144
00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:13.743
<v Speaker 2>It's unexplored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Territory is the great mother source of </v>

145
00:10:16.291 --> 00:10:18.660
<v Speaker 2>all determinant things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Creative and destructive,</v>

146
00:10:18.661 --> 00:10:19.494
<v Speaker 2>threatening and promising explored </v>
<v Speaker 2>territory is bringing father cumulative </v>

147
00:10:23.401 --> 00:10:27.000
<v Speaker 2>ancestral wisdom simultaneously </v>
<v Speaker 2>protective and tyrannical.</v>

148
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:28.583
<v Speaker 2>The process that mediates between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>two is the individual son of the great </v>

149
00:10:31.711 --> 00:10:35.340
<v Speaker 2>father and mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hero word who creates the cosmos.</v>

150
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.333
<v Speaker 2>That's a Christian viewpoint and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>adversary who spitefully rejects that </v>

151
00:10:39.001 --> 00:10:43.170
<v Speaker 2>creation about who we will talk for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>remainder of the course</v>

152
00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.490
<v Speaker 2>group identification,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think might be conceptualized as</v>

153
00:10:50.491 --> 00:10:55.320
<v Speaker 2>ritual limitation of the debt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>protects the undeveloped individual from</v>

154
00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:56.640
<v Speaker 2>the terrible forces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that rural,</v>

155
00:10:56.641 --> 00:11:00.540
<v Speaker 2>unexplored territory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is only to say that when you're on</v>

156
00:11:00.541 --> 00:11:02.020
<v Speaker 2>familiar ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not anxious.</v>

157
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.293
<v Speaker 2>You know what to do and the reason you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what to do is because you're </v>

158
00:11:05.641 --> 00:11:06.474
<v Speaker 2>imitating the actions of people who at </v>
<v Speaker 2>some point in the past figured out what </v>

159
00:11:09.841 --> 00:11:13.860
<v Speaker 2>to do and transmitted that knowledge to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you across the generations.</v>

160
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:14.993
<v Speaker 2>And you also tend to act in the presence</v>
<v Speaker 2>of others who also constitute your own </v>

161
00:11:18.151 --> 00:11:18.984
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are also beneficiaries of the same </v>

162
00:11:20.581 --> 00:11:23.790
<v Speaker 2>way as the men who therefore act </v>
<v Speaker 2>predictably kind of these,</v>

163
00:11:23.791 --> 00:11:24.624
<v Speaker 2>the fact of the predictability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact that protects you from </v>

164
00:11:26.641 --> 00:11:28.110
<v Speaker 2>unpredictability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By definition,</v>

165
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:36.000
<v Speaker 2>absolute identification with the group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however interferes with the process that</v>

166
00:11:36.001 --> 00:11:40.200
<v Speaker 2>maintains and updates the group and </v>
<v Speaker 2>increases the likelihood that protective</v>

167
00:11:40.201 --> 00:11:41.034
<v Speaker 2>strategies designed to maintain the </v>
<v Speaker 2>integrity of the group with necessary </v>

168
00:11:43.291 --> 00:11:46.080
<v Speaker 2>strategies will escalate into </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncontrollable warfare.</v>

169
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:47.693
<v Speaker 2>So then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given that if you identify with your </v>

170
00:11:50.761 --> 00:11:51.594
<v Speaker 2>group too strongly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will actually come to your group in </v>

171
00:11:53.891 --> 00:11:58.120
<v Speaker 2>the long run plus increase the </v>
<v Speaker 2>likelihood that you'll engage in perhaps</v>

172
00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:00.040
<v Speaker 2>unnecessary and counter productive.</v>

173
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.400
<v Speaker 2>How do groups that surround him group?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why do people do it?</v>

174
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:08.140
<v Speaker 2>What is it that motivates us to adopt </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute identification with the group?</v>

175
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:11.110
<v Speaker 2>We know burke proof identification has </v>
<v Speaker 2>its problems.</v>

176
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.310
<v Speaker 2>I identified with a group and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>identify with a different group of stage</v>

177
00:12:15.311 --> 00:12:16.144
<v Speaker 2>is set for our conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we also know that you have to </v>

178
00:12:17.831 --> 00:12:21.700
<v Speaker 2>identify with the group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

179
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.390
<v Speaker 2>so there has to be a balance struck </v>
<v Speaker 2>while people,</v>

180
00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:26.283
<v Speaker 2>there are situations in which time </v>
<v Speaker 2>balance is on your mind and people I </v>

181
00:12:28.161 --> 00:12:28.994
<v Speaker 2>talk to absolute identification with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>group and you get the construction of </v>

182
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.740
<v Speaker 2>totalitarian or authoritarian states and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Mo,</v>

183
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.970
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the motto of a totalitarian state,</v>

184
00:12:36.971 --> 00:12:40.480
<v Speaker 2>his every one should act exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same way.</v>

185
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.460
<v Speaker 2>So they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all absolutely predictable.</v>

186
00:12:42.461 --> 00:12:44.530
<v Speaker 2>That's what totalitarian means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Act The same way.</v>

187
00:12:44.531 --> 00:12:46.180
<v Speaker 2>You think the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look the same way.</v>

188
00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:49.000
<v Speaker 2>Believe the same things in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual.</v>

189
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:49.893
<v Speaker 2>These absolutely constrained by your </v>
<v Speaker 2>dogmatic identification and the </v>

190
00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:53.104
<v Speaker 2>advantage to that has been everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes extraordinarily predictable </v>

191
00:12:55.301 --> 00:12:56.134
<v Speaker 2>because everyone is a clone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally question is why would </v>

192
00:12:59.081 --> 00:13:01.120
<v Speaker 2>people do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the,</v>

193
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:03.910
<v Speaker 2>what's the attraction of absolute </v>
<v Speaker 2>identification?</v>

194
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.223
<v Speaker 2>Given that it's evident that such </v>
<v Speaker 2>identification also has negative </v>

195
00:13:07.961 --> 00:13:09.550
<v Speaker 2>consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you bother with,</v>

196
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.473
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we're going to try to </v>

197
00:13:10.601 --> 00:13:15.601
<v Speaker 2>discuss for the rest of the class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What forces motivate us to subjugate our</v>

198
00:13:16.511 --> 00:13:18.970
<v Speaker 2>individuality to the group?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then the question,</v>

199
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.930
<v Speaker 2>the question immediately rises </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially what are the consequences?</v>

200
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Like first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is individuality?</v>

201
00:13:25.001 --> 00:13:27.340
<v Speaker 2>What does it mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And second of all,</v>

202
00:13:27.341 --> 00:13:29.560
<v Speaker 2>what are the consequences of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuality?</v>

203
00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:30.653
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I'm trying to address in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chapter on self consciousness and </v>

204
00:13:33.701 --> 00:13:35.650
<v Speaker 2>the contamination of experience with </v>
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

205
00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.053
<v Speaker 2>Where would you put something like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious order in terms of group </v>

206
00:13:39.821 --> 00:13:41.890
<v Speaker 2>identification and individuality?</v>

207
00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually discussed this.</v>

208
00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:45.963
<v Speaker 2>Emilia invited me for dinner last night </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the faculty dinner and this is </v>

209
00:13:47.951 --> 00:13:49.510
<v Speaker 2>something that we discussed there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

210
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:51.303
<v Speaker 2>it strikes me that the purpose of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious order or any discipline for </v>

211
00:13:54.521 --> 00:13:59.521
<v Speaker 2>that matter is partly that the erection </v>
<v Speaker 2>of necessary boundaries of order,</v>

212
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:02.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have to have boundaries of </v>
<v Speaker 2>order.</v>

213
00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:07.480
<v Speaker 2>What those boundaries are can differ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean to some degree there's,</v>

214
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.333
<v Speaker 2>there's variation across groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that the boundaries has to </v>

215
00:14:11.651 --> 00:14:12.484
<v Speaker 2>be that it's partly so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>carve out a domain in which you're </v>

216
00:14:15.191 --> 00:14:17.320
<v Speaker 2>comfortable to act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's also partly because,</v>

217
00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:19.900
<v Speaker 2>and this is niches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>observation primarily.</v>

218
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:26.000
<v Speaker 2>If you don't identify with the group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never,</v>

219
00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.620
<v Speaker 2>you never disciplined yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he never subjected to any discipline.</v>

220
00:14:29.621 --> 00:14:30.454
<v Speaker 2>And as a consequence you're never able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to actually foster any sort of true </v>

221
00:14:33.731 --> 00:14:34.564
<v Speaker 2>individuality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would say voluntary slavery is a </v>

222
00:14:38.261 --> 00:14:43.261
<v Speaker 2>precondition for freedom and a dogmatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>group or a doctrine,</v>

223
00:14:43.361 --> 00:14:45.580
<v Speaker 2>let's say a doctrine because that's less</v>
<v Speaker 2>rigid,</v>

224
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.540
<v Speaker 2>a doctor and is something to which you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can adhere voluntarily.</v>

225
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.433
<v Speaker 2>And the purpose of that is that while </v>
<v Speaker 2>and excludes all sorts of possibilities </v>

226
00:14:53.271 --> 00:14:56.770
<v Speaker 2>so that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it's negative aspect in a sense.</v>

227
00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:01.490
<v Speaker 2>But it also allows you to develop the </v>
<v Speaker 2>skills necessary to do something.</v>

228
00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:02.583
<v Speaker 2>And so I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the example I always thinking about </v>

229
00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.690
<v Speaker 2>that's the apprenticeship or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

230
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.943
<v Speaker 2>so you want to be a concert pianist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you do first is learn how it was </v>

231
00:15:12.591 --> 00:15:15.900
<v Speaker 2>that all other concert pianists </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially behaved in the past.</v>

232
00:15:15.901 --> 00:15:17.970
<v Speaker 2>Do you develop your technical skills and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means your,</v>

233
00:15:17.971 --> 00:15:20.850
<v Speaker 2>is that your individuality is </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially subjugated to it,</v>

234
00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:23.480
<v Speaker 2>to a discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you've got the skills,</v>

235
00:15:23.481 --> 00:15:28.481
<v Speaker 2>then you can transcend the limitations </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that that discipline placed on me.</v>

236
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:29.773
<v Speaker 2>So that's why I wanted everyone to read </v>
<v Speaker 2>the abuse use and abuse of history </v>

237
00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:35.960
<v Speaker 2>because this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a problem that gt dealt with for</v>

238
00:15:35.961 --> 00:15:36.794
<v Speaker 2>a long period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact that he was a radical </v>

239
00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:40.283
<v Speaker 2>antichristian.</v>

240
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:41.443
<v Speaker 2>One of the things you constantly pointed</v>
<v Speaker 2>out in his philosophy was that </v>

241
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.193
<v Speaker 2>catholicism was net worth was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>precondition to European greatness in a </v>

242
00:15:49.791 --> 00:15:50.624
<v Speaker 2>sense because although it was arbitrary </v>
<v Speaker 2>and unfair and authoritarian and </v>

243
00:15:54.381 --> 00:15:58.520
<v Speaker 2>doctrinally bombed and destroyed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of useful things,</v>

244
00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:02.570
<v Speaker 2>it also forced people to discipline </v>
<v Speaker 2>their other spirits in a sense.</v>

245
00:16:02.571 --> 00:16:03.404
<v Speaker 2>But their minds at least to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said if you could learn to think one </v>

246
00:16:07.221 --> 00:16:12.221
<v Speaker 2>way in a discipline manner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then once you develop that ability,</v>

247
00:16:13.251 --> 00:16:15.830
<v Speaker 2>then you could use the ability to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all sorts of different ways.</v>

248
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.900
<v Speaker 2>But you never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could never do that.</v>

249
00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.273
<v Speaker 2>You'd never have the freedom without </v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all having gone through the </v>

250
00:16:23.241 --> 00:16:28.241
<v Speaker 2>disciplinary procedure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like the jesuits were the Franciscans</v>

251
00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:29.353
<v Speaker 2>you would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you consider it a totalitarian </v>

252
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.983
<v Speaker 2>group?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it would depend on the particular </v>

253
00:16:35.391 --> 00:16:36.224
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean groups tend towards a </v>

254
00:16:37.791 --> 00:16:42.791
<v Speaker 2>totalitarian</v>
<v Speaker 2>groups tend to worst totalitarian status</v>

255
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:47.900
<v Speaker 2>because partly because they have to for </v>
<v Speaker 2>a group to last for any length of time.</v>

256
00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:48.733
<v Speaker 2>It has to protect its structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means it has to exclude </v>

257
00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.840
<v Speaker 2>information that would result in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>undermining of instruction.</v>

258
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.810
<v Speaker 2>So for a group to exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to say,</v>

259
00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:00.470
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this group is the best group and if you,</v>

260
00:17:00.471 --> 00:17:04.580
<v Speaker 2>and the best thing you can do is be an </v>
<v Speaker 2>eminent member of this group.</v>

261
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.790
<v Speaker 2>So that's a perfectly reasonable moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>statement.</v>

262
00:17:07.791 --> 00:17:10.400
<v Speaker 2>It's just incomplete because at least as</v>
<v Speaker 2>far as I'm concerned,</v>

263
00:17:10.401 --> 00:17:14.690
<v Speaker 2>because of the problem with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>statement is that it eliminates the fact</v>

264
00:17:14.691 --> 00:17:17.420
<v Speaker 2>that in order for the group to maintain </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>

265
00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:18.283
<v Speaker 2>at least some of the group's members </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to transcend this limitation so </v>

266
00:17:20.541 --> 00:17:23.390
<v Speaker 2>that they can update the group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a tension,</v>

267
00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:24.673
<v Speaker 2>there's a tension between the group and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the individual that cannot be resolved </v>

268
00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:29.740
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or I think that's a,</v>

269
00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:31.400
<v Speaker 2>that's more or less reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 2>statement.</v>

270
00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:33.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

271
00:17:33.891 --> 00:17:38.570
<v Speaker 2>if you're a great newtonian physicist at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the end of the 19th century,</v>

272
00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:40.003
<v Speaker 2>what that might mean is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually such a great newtonian </v>

273
00:17:42.381 --> 00:17:45.620
<v Speaker 2>physicists that you undermine the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure of Newtonian physics.</v>

274
00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:51.370
<v Speaker 2>So there's a tension there and you'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>see this in mythologies as well.</v>

275
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:52.650
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No New Testament,</v>

276
00:17:52.651 --> 00:17:53.484
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ is presented as someone who had </v>

277
00:17:55.321 --> 00:17:59.580
<v Speaker 2>mastered his culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his dark truck completely by the time he</v>

278
00:17:59.581 --> 00:18:02.840
<v Speaker 2>was 12 that's why you could argue with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the elders,</v>

279
00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.440
<v Speaker 2>the temple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

280
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:05.800
<v Speaker 2>there's tremendous theirs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>theirs,</v>

281
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.823
<v Speaker 2>theirs</v>

282
00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:09.803
<v Speaker 2>recognition in that story of the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that before a doctrine can be </v>

283
00:18:13.471 --> 00:18:16.560
<v Speaker 2>transcended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to be absolutely mastered,</v>

284
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.610
<v Speaker 2>otherwise you risk otherwise your hero </v>
<v Speaker 2>is so to speak,</v>

285
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:23.820
<v Speaker 2>risks only me being surface heroism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

286
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:24.833
<v Speaker 2>it's actually undisciplined rebellion </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're just using the mask and here </v>

287
00:18:27.931 --> 00:18:30.780
<v Speaker 2>was to hide the fact that you're on </v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline from yourself.</v>

288
00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:34.170
<v Speaker 2>See this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an important,</v>

289
00:18:34.171 --> 00:18:35.004
<v Speaker 2>I think this is particularly important </v>
<v Speaker 2>for people and cultures like well like </v>

290
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:40.140
<v Speaker 2>the north and North American culture </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we tend to think,</v>

291
00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:41.483
<v Speaker 2>we tend to have a notion in our minds </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I think was fed by humanistic </v>

292
00:18:44.311 --> 00:18:45.144
<v Speaker 2>psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most pain in the 60s that groups are </v>

293
00:18:47.221 --> 00:18:48.054
<v Speaker 2>necessarily tyrannical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what a group does is squash your </v>

294
00:18:50.641 --> 00:18:52.170
<v Speaker 2>individuality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

295
00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:52.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does that.</v>

296
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:56.100
<v Speaker 2>But the other side of the coin as well </v>
<v Speaker 2>as its squashing it,</v>

297
00:18:56.101 --> 00:18:56.934
<v Speaker 2>it's also fostering it and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>way that you can get one without the </v>

298
00:18:59.711 --> 00:19:00.544
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although some groups are more </v>

299
00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:05.310
<v Speaker 2>totalitarian than others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what it group does.</v>

300
00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:08.520
<v Speaker 2>It has to do that or it will disappear </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if it disappears,</v>

301
00:19:08.521 --> 00:19:11.460
<v Speaker 2>well we know what the group does is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>brings order to chaos.</v>

302
00:19:11.461 --> 00:19:13.170
<v Speaker 2>So if your group disappears then there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

303
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.110
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing but chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

304
00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:18.083
<v Speaker 2>classic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ample viewpoint is that the cosmos is </v>

305
00:19:21.781 --> 00:19:25.560
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be property now it's right </v>
<v Speaker 2>for there to be the proper meaning.</v>

306
00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:28.730
<v Speaker 2>There has to be the right amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>order and the right amount of chaos and</v>

307
00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:34.170
<v Speaker 2>I both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both things are absolutely necessary.</v>

308
00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:35.813
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

309
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:38.183
<v Speaker 2>So I said absolute identification with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the group is motivated by the negative </v>

310
00:19:40.951 --> 00:19:43.620
<v Speaker 2>consequences of the development of self </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

311
00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.500
<v Speaker 2>So I guess you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

312
00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.553
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was interested in trying to answer a </v>

313
00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.570
<v Speaker 2>number of questions sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneous.</v>

314
00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:55.770
<v Speaker 2>Why is it that you would say you're in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Neil Knox,</v>

315
00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:56.683
<v Speaker 2>that's a good exam.</v>

316
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.903
<v Speaker 2>Just say that you're a Neo Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a strange thing to say </v>

317
00:20:02.861 --> 00:20:05.630
<v Speaker 2>because if you're a neo announcing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same as all the other agencies,</v>

318
00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.840
<v Speaker 2>so the you is almost disappeared </v>
<v Speaker 2>entirely.</v>

319
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.033
<v Speaker 2>You pick this group identification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the consequences of the group </v>

320
00:20:12.641 --> 00:20:13.474
<v Speaker 2>identification are that you surround </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself with a whole group of people </v>

321
00:20:15.761 --> 00:20:16.594
<v Speaker 2>think exactly like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's no threat in the group </v>

322
00:20:18.011 --> 00:20:18.844
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All anomalous information is placed in </v>

323
00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:22.054
<v Speaker 2>the outside of the group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the other thing that's interesting </v>

324
00:20:23.561 --> 00:20:26.030
<v Speaker 2>about being a Neo Nazi is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

325
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:30.370
<v Speaker 2>you're in it theoretically at least as </v>
<v Speaker 2>far as your concern,</v>

326
00:20:30.371 --> 00:20:32.250
<v Speaker 2>because that's the best group to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>part,</v>

327
00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:33.133
<v Speaker 2>so you're very moral and upright as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of your identification </v>

328
00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:36.573
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's peculiar is that it also gives </v>

329
00:20:37.841 --> 00:20:38.674
<v Speaker 2>you an immediate target,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the target is the target for all </v>

330
00:20:41.351 --> 00:20:42.184
<v Speaker 2>your resentment and hatred and cruelty </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all those things that you wouldn't </v>

331
00:20:44.381 --> 00:20:45.214
<v Speaker 2>really think that you would have as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>member of the most optimal conceivable </v>

332
00:20:49.511 --> 00:20:49.990
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>

333
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:50.823
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you justify that to yourself by saying </v>

334
00:20:51.981 --> 00:20:52.814
<v Speaker 2>that all that cruelty and resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hatred is necessary in the service of </v>

335
00:20:57.371 --> 00:20:58.204
<v Speaker 2>the group ideals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to see this makes me very skeptical </v>

336
00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:01.203
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's a rationalization as far as </v>

337
00:21:02.381 --> 00:21:03.214
<v Speaker 2>I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the person that situation has </v>

338
00:21:05.051 --> 00:21:09.310
<v Speaker 2>constructed up the world so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously they can be protected.</v>

339
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.073
<v Speaker 2>Although they're cowardly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can be protected from anomalous </v>

340
00:21:13.301 --> 00:21:17.260
<v Speaker 2>information with the group </v>
<v Speaker 2>identification and they can have all the</v>

341
00:21:17.261 --> 00:21:18.094
<v Speaker 2>advantage of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of retaining their cruelty and </v>

342
00:21:20.021 --> 00:21:23.230
<v Speaker 2>resentment and hatred while justifying </v>
<v Speaker 2>the morally.</v>

343
00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:27.190
<v Speaker 2>Now the question then becomes what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where does that,</v>

344
00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:30.280
<v Speaker 2>this is something I think psychology has</v>
<v Speaker 2>real problem with cause we don't have,</v>

345
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:31.413
<v Speaker 2>we don't have very good time grappling </v>
<v Speaker 2>with higher order emotions like </v>

346
00:21:33.611 --> 00:21:38.250
<v Speaker 2>resentment or jealousy or cruelty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we have a hard enough time with like</v>

347
00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:40.030
<v Speaker 2>base level emotions like anxiety.</v>

348
00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.350
<v Speaker 2>So why or where does the resentments and</v>
<v Speaker 2>cruelty come from?</v>

349
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:45.783
<v Speaker 2>What's at the base of it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it that someone would turn </v>

350
00:21:47.981 --> 00:21:48.814
<v Speaker 2>against,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let's not necessarily say turn </v>

351
00:21:50.261 --> 00:21:52.480
<v Speaker 2>against life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although you certainly do see that,</v>

352
00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:53.763
<v Speaker 2>but at least turn against large segments</v>
<v Speaker 2>of life and attempt to stamp it out of </v>

353
00:21:57.251 --> 00:21:58.084
<v Speaker 2>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's why I tried to write this </v>

354
00:21:59.771 --> 00:22:00.604
<v Speaker 2>chapter on the consequences of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>emergence of self conscious </v>

355
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:06.100
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is the basic idea.</v>

356
00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.073
<v Speaker 2>Development of human self consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>has contaminated the domain of </v>

357
00:22:10.631 --> 00:22:12.880
<v Speaker 2>unexplored territory with the threat of </v>
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

358
00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.660
<v Speaker 2>It's not something that makes us </v>
<v Speaker 2>different than out can.</v>

359
00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:21.910
<v Speaker 2>I think that the valence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know from a very early age,</v>

360
00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:22.893
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to say how early or five maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we not only are able to react </v>

361
00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:33.400
<v Speaker 2>emotionally to phenomena that we can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>predict.</v>

362
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:34.263
<v Speaker 2>I mean we can do that when we're too and</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals do that like a long ways down </v>

363
00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:38.680
<v Speaker 2>the phylogenetic chain.</v>

364
00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:40.083
<v Speaker 2>We have added to that the possibility of</v>
<v Speaker 2>inferring from the mere presence of the </v>

365
00:22:43.751 --> 00:22:48.751
<v Speaker 2>known that the possibility of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>imminent demise or painful demise one,</v>

366
00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:51.093
<v Speaker 2>one of the two and that's something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's unique to people and I think </v>

367
00:22:53.231 --> 00:22:54.064
<v Speaker 2>that's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very large part of what it means </v>

368
00:22:55.421 --> 00:22:56.254
<v Speaker 2>to be self conscious when that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of thing we're going to try to </v>

369
00:22:57.971 --> 00:23:00.700
<v Speaker 2>discuss today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're self conscious,</v>

370
00:23:00.701 --> 00:23:03.070
<v Speaker 2>it means that you can view yourself as </v>
<v Speaker 2>an object,</v>

371
00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:03.963
<v Speaker 2>although you're a subject,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can view yourself as if you were an </v>

372
00:23:05.931 --> 00:23:06.764
<v Speaker 2>object in relationship to other objects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing about an object is that </v>

373
00:23:09.671 --> 00:23:11.710
<v Speaker 2>it's something that has defined </v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristics,</v>

374
00:23:11.711 --> 00:23:12.800
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

375
00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.490
<v Speaker 2>if you can identify an object,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know its borders.</v>

376
00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:20.670
<v Speaker 2>So this book has four sides basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's certain extension in space.</v>

377
00:23:20.831 --> 00:23:22.660
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes it an object.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

378
00:23:22.661 --> 00:23:23.494
<v Speaker 2>if you're self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what that means is that you can view </v>

379
00:23:26.081 --> 00:23:28.540
<v Speaker 2>yourself as an object that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>limitations.</v>

380
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:31.720
<v Speaker 2>And we know our spatial limitations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not that hard to defined.</v>

381
00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.800
<v Speaker 2>Maybe even animals are aware of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>spatial limitations in the sense theory,</v>

382
00:23:35.801 --> 00:23:36.634
<v Speaker 2>extension space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing that really makes us </v>

383
00:23:39.041 --> 00:23:41.260
<v Speaker 2>unique is that we're aware of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>temporal limitation,</v>

384
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:43.570
<v Speaker 2>which is that if you have a beginning </v>
<v Speaker 2>and an end,</v>

385
00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.430
<v Speaker 2>and that is something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's no evidence for it all.</v>

386
00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:47.273
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll paint.</v>

387
00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:51.110
<v Speaker 2>It's something that makes us absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>unique.</v>

388
00:23:51.111 --> 00:23:51.944
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that that's done </v>
<v Speaker 2>to us is height I think has heightened </v>

389
00:23:54.831 --> 00:23:58.070
<v Speaker 2>the emotional significance of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown.</v>

390
00:23:58.550 --> 00:23:59.383
<v Speaker 2>Because w you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that well you see this say in </v>

391
00:24:03.261 --> 00:24:05.160
<v Speaker 2>hypochondriacal conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

392
00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:06.013
<v Speaker 2>someone has a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe they have what a normal </v>

393
00:24:08.301 --> 00:24:11.450
<v Speaker 2>person would regard as a backache.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the normal person,</v>

394
00:24:11.451 --> 00:24:12.290
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would say,</v>

395
00:24:12.291 --> 00:24:13.124
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my back hurts and the way they go to </v>

396
00:24:13.851 --> 00:24:15.650
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the hyper can drive.</v>

397
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:18.620
<v Speaker 2>Gold person says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my back hurts.</v>

398
00:24:18.621 --> 00:24:21.770
<v Speaker 2>That's the phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the inference is I might die.</v>

399
00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:23.270
<v Speaker 2>And so you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

400
00:24:23.271 --> 00:24:25.580
<v Speaker 2>the anomalous information is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>backache,</v>

401
00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:29.300
<v Speaker 2>but it's a window into a realm of </v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown phenomena.</v>

402
00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:31.003
<v Speaker 2>One and t hen you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are known phenomena have a range </v>

403
00:24:34.761 --> 00:24:35.594
<v Speaker 2>of possibilities and the range of </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities defined by death </v>

404
00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:42.260
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's one of the,</v>

405
00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:43.243
<v Speaker 2>when when we say that we're conscious </v>
<v Speaker 2>are much more conscious than animals </v>

406
00:24:46.281 --> 00:24:47.114
<v Speaker 2>sort say self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that we're saying is </v>

407
00:24:48.711 --> 00:24:49.544
<v Speaker 2>that the emotional valence of phenomena </v>
<v Speaker 2>is heightened for us because we can </v>

408
00:24:52.401 --> 00:24:56.750
<v Speaker 2>understand cognitively the consequences </v>
<v Speaker 2>of things that strike as emotional.</v>

409
00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:57.643
<v Speaker 2>So there's a theme that the way things </v>
<v Speaker 2>are supposed to work is that so to </v>

410
00:25:00.951 --> 00:25:01.784
<v Speaker 2>speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same report,</v>

411
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:04.700
<v Speaker 2>you didn't exist it and recognizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something as anomalous.</v>

412
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:06.463
<v Speaker 2>So you focus your attention on a message</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes out to your prefrontal cortex and </v>

413
00:25:09.171 --> 00:25:11.120
<v Speaker 2>the messages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anomalous information,</v>

414
00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:12.293
<v Speaker 2>reconfigure behaviors so it goes away or</v>
<v Speaker 2>be configured mode of interpretation so </v>

415
00:25:15.711 --> 00:25:16.940
<v Speaker 2>that it's no longer threatening.</v>

416
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:18.223
<v Speaker 2>That's perfectly fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if your prefrontal cortex then it </v>

417
00:25:20.031 --> 00:25:21.230
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes,</v>

418
00:25:21.231 --> 00:25:22.064
<v Speaker 2>that really is much more friendly than </v>
<v Speaker 2>even then you might think as a </v>

419
00:25:24.051 --> 00:25:24.884
<v Speaker 2>consequence of your natural impulses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there's a feedback group that </v>

420
00:25:27.201 --> 00:25:29.540
<v Speaker 2>develops where you see this and panic </v>
<v Speaker 2>attacks,</v>

421
00:25:29.541 --> 00:25:31.640
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart palpitations.</v>

422
00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:33.530
<v Speaker 2>Well No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might die.</v>

423
00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:34.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

424
00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:36.293
<v Speaker 2>The whole system cycles out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point being that the inhibitory </v>

425
00:25:40.521 --> 00:25:41.354
<v Speaker 2>mechanisms that have developed </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionarily to help us conquer our </v>

426
00:25:46.371 --> 00:25:49.440
<v Speaker 2>fears can also be used to dramatically </v>
<v Speaker 2>heighten them.</v>

427
00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.310
<v Speaker 2>And when we talk about the development </v>
<v Speaker 2>of self consciousness,</v>

428
00:25:52.311 --> 00:25:53.144
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about cause that's one of the </v>

429
00:25:54.381 --> 00:25:59.381
<v Speaker 2>things that implies</v>
<v Speaker 2>selfconsciousness passable.</v>

430
00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:05.630
<v Speaker 2>Well it's much less possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole,</v>

431
00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:09.050
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the underground purposes </v>
<v Speaker 2>of group identification.</v>

432
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.943
<v Speaker 2>That's that's that's like underlying the</v>
<v Speaker 2>argument that I'm trying to make all </v>

433
00:26:13.311 --> 00:26:14.144
<v Speaker 2>along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why identify with the group subjugates </v>

434
00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.770
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>

435
00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:20.390
<v Speaker 2>That's now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's now,</v>

436
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.400
<v Speaker 2>you see the problem with that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>

437
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:24.890
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question is in some part,</v>

438
00:26:24.891 --> 00:26:25.724
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the architect of self </v>

439
00:26:26.221 --> 00:26:28.070
<v Speaker 2>consciousness?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the hero?</v>

440
00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:30.800
<v Speaker 2>Now this is a strange thing because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty,</v>

441
00:26:30.801 --> 00:26:32.180
<v Speaker 2>it's very paradoxical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

442
00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.400
<v Speaker 2>Because something that's self,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like us,</v>

443
00:26:34.401 --> 00:26:37.160
<v Speaker 2>that self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of that self consciousness itself,</v>

444
00:26:37.161 --> 00:26:39.470
<v Speaker 2>consciousness of vulnerability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you think,</v>

445
00:26:39.471 --> 00:26:43.110
<v Speaker 2>well that's the opposite of something as</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful as the notion of the hero.</v>

446
00:26:43.111 --> 00:26:43.944
<v Speaker 2>But it's not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a precondition for heroism because </v>

447
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:49.680
<v Speaker 2>courage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an essential aspect of heroism,</v>

448
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.200
<v Speaker 2>is predicated on recognition of </v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerabilities,</v>

449
00:26:52.201 --> 00:26:53.034
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to know you can be hurt before </v>

450
00:26:53.821 --> 00:26:55.590
<v Speaker 2>you can be brave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise you just,</v>

451
00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:58.020
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just stupid basically.</v>

452
00:26:58.750 --> 00:26:59.730
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying two things.</v>

453
00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:01.860
<v Speaker 4>One of which I agree with though in that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to show,</v>

454
00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:02.783
<v Speaker 4>if that's what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first is that we can abstract a </v>

455
00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:07.680
<v Speaker 4>death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can think about it and make racist,</v>

456
00:27:07.681 --> 00:27:08.500
<v Speaker 4>emotional valence,</v>

457
00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:09.333
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also a defining characteristic of </v>

458
00:27:10.871 --> 00:27:13.150
<v Speaker 2>our b,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we're vulnerable to it.</v>

459
00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:14.913
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the second thing that I hear you </v>

460
00:27:15.431 --> 00:27:18.100
<v Speaker 4>saying is that humans respond,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

461
00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.070
<v Speaker 4>stronger to the presence of anomalies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

462
00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:23.090
<v Speaker 2>That's the argument I'm making.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

463
00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:24.053
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we react more strongly to the presence </v>

464
00:27:25.871 --> 00:27:28.210
<v Speaker 2>of a normal knee in general because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can make,</v>

465
00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.820
<v Speaker 2>we can make inferences about what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown might mean,</v>

466
00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:34.000
<v Speaker 2>which is only to say your plan for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>

467
00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.920
<v Speaker 2>And why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

468
00:27:35.921 --> 00:27:38.980
<v Speaker 2>it's because you can draw conclusions </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the present,</v>

469
00:27:38.981 --> 00:27:39.814
<v Speaker 2>from occurrences in the present about </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities that may happen in the </v>

470
00:27:42.341 --> 00:27:43.540
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

471
00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:44.553
<v Speaker 2>you have a healthcare program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's because you've drawn the </v>

472
00:27:46.901 --> 00:27:47.734
<v Speaker 2>inference that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being such as yourself is vulnerable to </v>

473
00:27:50.201 --> 00:27:52.630
<v Speaker 2>a whole class of phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which includes,</v>

474
00:27:52.631 --> 00:27:54.280
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly the possibility of illness.</v>

475
00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:58.180
<v Speaker 2>Any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any set amount of severity up to a fatal</v>

476
00:27:58.181 --> 00:27:59.230
<v Speaker 2>illness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

477
00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:02.290
<v Speaker 2>you make plans to take that fact into </v>
<v Speaker 2>account.</v>

478
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:05.140
<v Speaker 2>The fact that we'll do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the things that drives us to</v>

479
00:28:05.141 --> 00:28:06.460
<v Speaker 2>construct cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

480
00:28:06.461 --> 00:28:07.294
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's part of the argument I try </v>

481
00:28:08.241 --> 00:28:09.640
<v Speaker 2>and make as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do people,</v>

482
00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:12.430
<v Speaker 2>why are people engaged in construction </v>
<v Speaker 2>of cultures?</v>

483
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:13.710
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

484
00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:16.590
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still tend to to see it as I would,</v>

485
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:17.453
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't say that humans react </v>
<v Speaker 4>stronger to the nominally because like </v>

486
00:28:19.711 --> 00:28:21.300
<v Speaker 4>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when a rat is presented with,</v>

487
00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:23.850
<v Speaker 4>with an an endless something in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cage,</v>

488
00:28:23.851 --> 00:28:24.684
<v Speaker 4>it freezes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you rarely see humans phrase that's </v>

489
00:28:27.081 --> 00:28:27.914
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the reason is I think because </v>

490
00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:32.070
<v Speaker 4>animals cannot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have this cognition to be able to,</v>

491
00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:33.150
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't,</v>

492
00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:34.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can't necessarily remember or,</v>

493
00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.330
<v Speaker 4>or make these natural category as well </v>
<v Speaker 4>as we can.</v>

494
00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.620
<v Speaker 4>And so what we would say is anomalous </v>
<v Speaker 4>information,</v>

495
00:28:40.621 --> 00:28:43.170
<v Speaker 4>it only breaks certain levels and when </v>
<v Speaker 4>it does break,</v>

496
00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:44.813
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe we can break these levels </v>

497
00:28:45.601 --> 00:28:49.230
<v Speaker 4>consciously what I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I wouldn't say that that,</v>

498
00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:50.660
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm actually stronger.</v>

499
00:28:50.661 --> 00:28:50.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

500
00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:52.260
<v Speaker 2>Well I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

501
00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.350
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're touching on another argument that</v>

502
00:28:54.351 --> 00:28:56.240
<v Speaker 2>we'll get to really near the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>course,</v>

503
00:28:56.241 --> 00:28:57.074
<v Speaker 2>which is that although selfconsciousness</v>
<v Speaker 2>heightens the effect of valence of </v>

504
00:28:59.931 --> 00:29:00.764
<v Speaker 2>something like the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also provides a mode of dealing with </v>

505
00:29:03.621 --> 00:29:05.300
<v Speaker 2>it that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that animals don't have.</v>

506
00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:06.390
<v Speaker 2>That's why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

507
00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:07.910
<v Speaker 2>fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

508
00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:10.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get into that part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the argument right now though,</v>

509
00:29:10.101 --> 00:29:13.940
<v Speaker 2>because it's very complicated and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of presumes that we've gone through</v>

510
00:29:13.941 --> 00:29:18.090
<v Speaker 2>all of this as a presupposition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because self like I'll,</v>

511
00:29:18.091 --> 00:29:21.410
<v Speaker 2>I'll put it in very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Christian,</v>

512
00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:24.440
<v Speaker 2>the Christian myth essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>presuppose it's two things.</v>

513
00:29:24.441 --> 00:29:26.460
<v Speaker 2>One is that I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

514
00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:28.850
<v Speaker 2>I'll talk a little bit about Buddhism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the here in a minute too.</v>

515
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:33.380
<v Speaker 2>What is it that it was the development </v>
<v Speaker 2>of self consciousness consciousness that</v>

516
00:29:33.381 --> 00:29:36.920
<v Speaker 2>knocked people out of paragraphs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what number one,</v>

517
00:29:36.921 --> 00:29:37.754
<v Speaker 2>into the normal world and mass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world is characterized by awareness </v>

518
00:29:40.791 --> 00:29:45.791
<v Speaker 2>of as manifested as shame,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is precisely equivalent to</v>

519
00:29:45.911 --> 00:29:47.230
<v Speaker 2>knowledge of vulnerability.</v>

520
00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:48.843
<v Speaker 2>What else would it mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And knowledge of death and knowledge of </v>

521
00:29:51.791 --> 00:29:52.780
<v Speaker 2>good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

522
00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:55.420
<v Speaker 2>All those things are congregating </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and the genesis story,</v>

523
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:57.910
<v Speaker 2>but the rest of the Christian story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

524
00:29:57.911 --> 00:30:02.350
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the story is how heightened </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness can actually be used as an</v>

525
00:30:02.351 --> 00:30:06.130
<v Speaker 2>antidote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the thing is is that although a small</v>

526
00:30:06.131 --> 00:30:06.964
<v Speaker 2>dose of something might kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a larger dose might curie and that's </v>

527
00:30:10.241 --> 00:30:11.074
<v Speaker 2>basically the notion that's that's under</v>
<v Speaker 2>law that well that underlies adaptive </v>

528
00:30:14.651 --> 00:30:16.660
<v Speaker 2>mythology in general as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell,</v>

529
00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.300
<v Speaker 2>so a little knowledge is a dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

530
00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:22.930
<v Speaker 2>That's the apple at the snake provides </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

531
00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:23.920
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

532
00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:26.740
<v Speaker 2>you know who you are and what happens </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you know who you are.</v>

533
00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:27.753
<v Speaker 2>When the human cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get all the knowledge of God so to </v>

534
00:30:29.831 --> 00:30:30.664
<v Speaker 2>speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without any of the power so you can see </v>

535
00:30:32.261 --> 00:30:32.860
<v Speaker 2>your borders.</v>

536
00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.080
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden you know that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to die.</v>

537
00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:37.510
<v Speaker 2>You have to start making plans for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>

538
00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:38.493
<v Speaker 2>That means you have to work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is another thing that happens in </v>

539
00:30:40.541 --> 00:30:42.580
<v Speaker 2>genesis as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're condemned to work.</v>

540
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:43.423
<v Speaker 2>The why you worked was because you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>view the future as a place of negative </v>

541
00:30:46.361 --> 00:30:48.730
<v Speaker 2>possibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of which are hypothetical.</v>

542
00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.730
<v Speaker 2>All of which you attempt to conquer even</v>
<v Speaker 2>before they appear.</v>

543
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:52.833
<v Speaker 2>That's planning and when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you start up grain for the winter </v>

544
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:57.303
<v Speaker 2>is because you can perceive anomalous </v>
<v Speaker 2>information where it hasn't even </v>

545
00:30:59.801 --> 00:31:02.500
<v Speaker 2>manifested itself in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's intelligence.</v>

546
00:31:02.501 --> 00:31:03.334
<v Speaker 2>We don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't,</v>

547
00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:04.413
<v Speaker 2>we don't tend to to emphasize the </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional aspect of intelligence that </v>

548
00:31:07.391 --> 00:31:08.224
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but extraordinary anxiety I think is </v>

549
00:31:09.971 --> 00:31:12.100
<v Speaker 2>part of the force that drives </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>

550
00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:13.593
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll get to the other part of that </v>

551
00:31:15.551 --> 00:31:17.590
<v Speaker 2>argument lead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

552
00:31:17.591 --> 00:31:18.424
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to make the point that the </v>

553
00:31:20.111 --> 00:31:20.944
<v Speaker 2>fact that people are developed </v>
<v Speaker 2>selfconsciousness has made us much more </v>

554
00:31:23.591 --> 00:31:26.650
<v Speaker 2>susceptible to anxiety and also the </v>
<v Speaker 2>curiosity,</v>

555
00:31:26.651 --> 00:31:28.660
<v Speaker 2>I think as it turns out than other </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals are.</v>

556
00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:30.173
<v Speaker 2>And it's also provided motivation for us</v>
<v Speaker 2>to try to reject the fact of our </v>

557
00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:35.023
<v Speaker 2>consciousness in any possible way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that provides additional motivation </v>

558
00:31:38.111 --> 00:31:41.550
<v Speaker 2>for adoption of an authoritarian stance </v>
<v Speaker 2>just to save me.</v>

559
00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:42.993
<v Speaker 2>It's the fact of your ignorance and </v>
<v Speaker 2>limitation that bring about all the </v>

560
00:31:45.761 --> 00:31:49.620
<v Speaker 2>painful things that are associated with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with hall humility basically.</v>

561
00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:50.463
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think about the occasions when you </v>

562
00:31:51.941 --> 00:31:54.310
<v Speaker 2>have to admit to making a mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

563
00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:56.890
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's absolutely necessary,</v>

564
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:58.780
<v Speaker 2>but it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very annoying.</v>

565
00:31:58.781 --> 00:31:59.614
<v Speaker 2>It's embarrassing as a matter of fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>because because what it means to make a </v>

566
00:32:02.771 --> 00:32:03.604
<v Speaker 2>mistake is that you admit to yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know that an essential aspect </v>

567
00:32:07.031 --> 00:32:07.864
<v Speaker 2>of your vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that you're obviously you </v>

568
00:32:09.491 --> 00:32:10.324
<v Speaker 2>perfect and so and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to actually make a statement </v>

569
00:32:12.101 --> 00:32:13.750
<v Speaker 2>about pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is the case.</v>

570
00:32:13.751 --> 00:32:15.530
<v Speaker 2>If you want to embarrass someone in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>space,</v>

571
00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.020
<v Speaker 2>what you do social ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

572
00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:18.213
<v Speaker 2>It's like there are doing a good job of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hiding their vulnerabilities and just </v>

573
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:24.190
<v Speaker 2>pop a little information that makes one </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely evidence.</v>

574
00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.820
<v Speaker 2>They'll turn red</v>
<v Speaker 2>fall into themselves,</v>

575
00:32:27.821 --> 00:32:28.654
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

576
00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:31.473
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of dealing with that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>to try to read you one way of dealing </v>

577
00:32:35.171 --> 00:32:36.004
<v Speaker 2>with it is to try to rid yourself of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your individuality as one of the </v>

578
00:32:40.131 --> 00:32:44.160
<v Speaker 2>things group identification serves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

579
00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:47.870
<v Speaker 2>and the contamination of the unknown </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the threat of mortality.</v>

580
00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.440
<v Speaker 2>I can animal a deer or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in,</v>

581
00:32:50.441 --> 00:32:55.441
<v Speaker 2>it hurt her and her dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they see a why am nearby or honestly,</v>

582
00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:59.390
<v Speaker 2>herds of envelopes will raise quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>quiet lions.</v>

583
00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:01.520
<v Speaker 2>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a general rule,</v>

584
00:33:01.521 --> 00:33:02.354
<v Speaker 2>the lions have to manifest a particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern of behavior before the lopes </v>

585
00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:08.280
<v Speaker 2>become afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not really because there are,</v>

586
00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.480
<v Speaker 2>it's not because they're afraid that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>envelopes would kill them.</v>

587
00:33:11.481 --> 00:33:14.930
<v Speaker 2>It's because they're hardwired to </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize a particular pattern,</v>

588
00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:17.240
<v Speaker 2>predatory behavior and responding to it </v>
<v Speaker 2>with fear.</v>

589
00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:18.293
<v Speaker 2>And if antelopes were self conscious and</v>
<v Speaker 2>could think they'd get the hell out of </v>

590
00:33:20.451 --> 00:33:21.284
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and whenever there was a line anywhere </v>

591
00:33:22.461 --> 00:33:25.430
<v Speaker 2>near and they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not afraid of death,</v>

592
00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:28.880
<v Speaker 2>they're afraid of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>normally we're afraid of anomaly,</v>

593
00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:30.230
<v Speaker 2>but it's contaminated for us.</v>

594
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:33.200
<v Speaker 2>It's contaminated with the possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just death.</v>

595
00:33:33.201 --> 00:33:34.034
<v Speaker 2>That's just the biggest aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's all imaginable suffering </v>

596
00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:38.353
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what you know how your </v>

597
00:33:40.791 --> 00:33:43.130
<v Speaker 2>imagination can grip on to things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say It's,</v>

598
00:33:43.131 --> 00:33:44.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were alone at night,</v>

599
00:33:44.481 --> 00:33:45.314
<v Speaker 2>that's a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You a little bit less stable than you </v>

600
00:33:47.841 --> 00:33:48.674
<v Speaker 2>might otherwise be that day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some little nagging thing is worrying </v>

601
00:33:51.501 --> 00:33:53.420
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easy for your imagination,</v>

602
00:33:53.421 --> 00:33:54.254
<v Speaker 2>take that little chunk of information </v>
<v Speaker 2>below it up and you know any number of </v>

603
00:33:57.980 --> 00:33:58.813
<v Speaker 2>possible ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it seems like Brandon was the </v>

604
00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:05.660
<v Speaker 2>anomalies either either gives you this </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional balance or you're here,</v>

605
00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.290
<v Speaker 2>but as humans had this huge array of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

606
00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.021
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

607
00:34:09.021 --> 00:34:11.330
<v Speaker 2>we're normally it down here because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can track these,</v>

608
00:34:11.331 --> 00:34:12.560
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stories that protect us,</v>

609
00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:14.960
<v Speaker 2>but then the thought can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can bring us,</v>

610
00:34:14.961 --> 00:34:15.794
<v Speaker 2>can titanus to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the level where we might need it to </v>

611
00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:18.560
<v Speaker 2>get us the heck out of.</v>

612
00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:19.910
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

613
00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:20.783
<v Speaker 2>I you're referring to the possibility of</v>
<v Speaker 2>moving the information stored of up and </v>

614
00:34:24.051 --> 00:34:24.884
<v Speaker 2>down levels of stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While I think that's one of the things </v>

615
00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:27.313
<v Speaker 2>that's another one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are cognitive flexibility has allowed </v>

616
00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:30.413
<v Speaker 2>mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a negative thing in some ways </v>

617
00:34:31.431 --> 00:34:32.264
<v Speaker 2>because it does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means that you can make a mountain </v>

618
00:34:34.191 --> 00:34:35.024
<v Speaker 2>out a molehill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's positive for all sorts of other </v>

619
00:34:38.121 --> 00:34:42.920
<v Speaker 2>obvious reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe look regards to her original,</v>

620
00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:46.330
<v Speaker 2>what the threat of death does for </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilizations.</v>

621
00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:47.173
<v Speaker 2>You think about the Egyptians in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Egyptian spent their whole time </v>

622
00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:51.373
<v Speaker 2>essentially dealing with death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the basis of their whole </v>

623
00:34:55.731 --> 00:34:56.830
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

624
00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:00.560
<v Speaker 2>there are civilizations were devoted in </v>
<v Speaker 2>large part towards construction of these</v>

625
00:35:00.561 --> 00:35:03.260
<v Speaker 2>massive pyramids and that took a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

626
00:35:03.261 --> 00:35:04.094
<v Speaker 2>It took a lot of cultural energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know some of the methodology behind </v>

627
00:35:07.041 --> 00:35:07.250
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

628
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:10.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean for the Egyptians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Pharaoh was the intermediary between</v>

629
00:35:10.431 --> 00:35:11.264
<v Speaker 2>heaven and earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to the degree that you participated </v>

630
00:35:12.651 --> 00:35:13.484
<v Speaker 2>in the life of the Pharaoh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were granted at least partial </v>

631
00:35:15.561 --> 00:35:18.350
<v Speaker 2>status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the partial status of having an immortal</v>

632
00:35:18.351 --> 00:35:19.280
<v Speaker 2>soul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

633
00:35:19.281 --> 00:35:21.680
<v Speaker 2>that was a potent enough motivator for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Egyptian so that,</v>

634
00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:22.773
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they engaged in what was essentially a </v>

635
00:35:24.591 --> 00:35:25.424
<v Speaker 2>recreational cultural activity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't really define what they're </v>

636
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:29.840
<v Speaker 2>doing in terms of any simplistic notions</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

637
00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:35.120
<v Speaker 2>of making sure there was enough to eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>or any rational economically motivated,</v>

638
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:39.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas as far as I can tell anyways,</v>

639
00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:43.190
<v Speaker 2>a lot of work into building those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those more than monuments.</v>

640
00:35:43.191 --> 00:35:45.480
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing was true for this </v>
<v Speaker 2>medieval Christians.</v>

641
00:35:45.481 --> 00:35:46.314
<v Speaker 2>With regards to the cathedrals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Often those were the constructions of </v>

642
00:35:49.261 --> 00:35:50.094
<v Speaker 2>those cathedrals sort of equivalent to </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a sense to that can alter the space </v>

643
00:35:53.041 --> 00:35:58.041
<v Speaker 2>program and the 1960s height of </v>
<v Speaker 2>technological endeavor and you know,</v>

644
00:35:58.861 --> 00:35:59.694
<v Speaker 2>a lot of our cultural activities </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivated by fear of death because we </v>

645
00:36:03.031 --> 00:36:05.160
<v Speaker 2>plan then it's not just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

646
00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:06.450
<v Speaker 2>it's vulnerability in general.</v>

647
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:09.330
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the idea is this,</v>

648
00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:12.443
<v Speaker 2>the fact that the development of self </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness has meant that for us the </v>

649
00:36:15.871 --> 00:36:16.704
<v Speaker 2>unknown is contaminated with threat of </v>
<v Speaker 2>death has much more extreme emotional </v>

650
00:36:21.421 --> 00:36:23.490
<v Speaker 2>valence for us than it does for other </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>

651
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.430
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the consequences of that is we're</v>

652
00:36:26.431 --> 00:36:30.360
<v Speaker 2>much more motivated to plan for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future and to construct how to construct</v>

653
00:36:30.361 --> 00:36:31.194
<v Speaker 2>cultural structures in general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing is we're much more </v>

654
00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:37.950
<v Speaker 2>motivated to get ourselves away from any</v>
<v Speaker 2>information that's anomalous,</v>

655
00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:40.770
<v Speaker 2>to reject it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to protect ourselves from it.</v>

656
00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:42.183
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>underlies our temptation towards the </v>

657
00:36:46.531 --> 00:36:51.140
<v Speaker 2>adoption of authoritarianism as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian says in what's that?</v>

658
00:36:51.141 --> 00:36:51.974
<v Speaker 2>The basis of authoritarian is it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>either the personal adoption of </v>

659
00:36:56.671 --> 00:36:59.850
<v Speaker 2>omniscience hit inhibitors cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Darlin's case,</v>

660
00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:03.910
<v Speaker 2>or it's the secondary adoption of </v>
<v Speaker 2>omniscience and uneven,</v>

661
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:06.540
<v Speaker 2>more cowardly mattered in someone like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler,</v>

662
00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.460
<v Speaker 2>at least this is the way I look at it.</v>

663
00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:09.713
<v Speaker 2>He was sort of out on the front lines of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the authoritarian struggle and someone </v>

664
00:37:12.271 --> 00:37:13.890
<v Speaker 2>could have taken a shot at him at any </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

665
00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.233
<v Speaker 2>but all the followers of hidden and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got to identify with his power </v>

666
00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:19.013
<v Speaker 2>and his beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not actually putting themselves on the </v>

667
00:37:20.761 --> 00:37:24.450
<v Speaker 2>line and that's the essential nature of </v>
<v Speaker 2>an authoritarian stance.</v>

668
00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:28.800
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know everything that needs to be no.</v>

669
00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:32.940
<v Speaker 2>So if you offer any information that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward to my foreign,</v>

670
00:37:32.941 --> 00:37:36.520
<v Speaker 2>to my my particular theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's obvious that you're an agent of,</v>

671
00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:37.763
<v Speaker 2>while we say an agent of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way something to be eliminated as is as </v>

672
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:45.510
<v Speaker 2>efficiently as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hence adoption of omniscience.</v>

673
00:37:45.511 --> 00:37:46.344
<v Speaker 2>That's where the authoritarian is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>means and the motivation for that is </v>

674
00:37:49.321 --> 00:37:50.154
<v Speaker 2>that if you know everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there isn't anything unknown and if the </v>

675
00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:55.283
<v Speaker 2>unknown has this sort of vantage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can understand why people are </v>

676
00:37:56.881 --> 00:37:57.960
<v Speaker 2>motivated to get rid of it.</v>

677
00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:01.740
<v Speaker 2>Now the problem with the development of </v>
<v Speaker 2>an authoritarian personality,</v>

678
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:06.900
<v Speaker 2>this is why I wanted you to read Milton </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the note in this parable,</v>

679
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:07.823
<v Speaker 2>paradise lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is about the consequences of the </v>

680
00:38:10.711 --> 00:38:13.410
<v Speaker 2>adoption of the numbness in stance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the devil sin,</v>

681
00:38:13.411 --> 00:38:14.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as I will be like,</v>

682
00:38:14.911 --> 00:38:16.740
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to take the place of God.</v>

683
00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:18.900
<v Speaker 2>As soon as that happens in Middleton </v>
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>

684
00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:20.153
<v Speaker 2>devil's cast down into to help where and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get out of it at any time just </v>

685
00:38:23.641 --> 00:38:25.620
<v Speaker 2>by admitting he was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he won't have been.</v>

686
00:38:25.621 --> 00:38:26.454
<v Speaker 2>He was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that if he </v>

687
00:38:28.111 --> 00:38:30.540
<v Speaker 2>admitted he was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to face all the chaos that he'd</v>

688
00:38:30.541 --> 00:38:32.970
<v Speaker 2>been avoiding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a good,</v>

689
00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 2>this is one of our fries meeting of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same parable.</v>

690
00:38:35.981 --> 00:38:38.050
<v Speaker 2>It's a good or a little about the rise </v>
<v Speaker 2>of states.</v>

691
00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:38.883
<v Speaker 2>Like in union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a cumulative evidence gathered </v>

692
00:38:42.401 --> 00:38:44.400
<v Speaker 2>up over the course of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was certainly,</v>

693
00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:45.533
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't evident by the fifth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harmony doesn't look at working with </v>

694
00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:53.080
<v Speaker 2>certainly evidence by the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sixties it still took another 2030 years</v>

695
00:38:53.111 --> 00:38:54.970
<v Speaker 2>before the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

696
00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:57.930
<v Speaker 2>it's not like people gave it up really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just more like the,</v>

697
00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:02.310
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't even self supporting anymore.</v>

698
00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:03.163
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't go on any farther.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't admit to any anomalous </v>

699
00:39:07.451 --> 00:39:08.284
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was inflammation that would </v>

700
00:39:09.821 --> 00:39:12.400
<v Speaker 2>suggest that there are particular theory</v>
<v Speaker 2>was wrong.</v>

701
00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.033
<v Speaker 2>Having just not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not as if it's a stance that only </v>

702
00:39:15.401 --> 00:39:16.234
<v Speaker 2>characterized as communists that </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly it's just this is the stance </v>

703
00:39:20.051 --> 00:39:23.500
<v Speaker 2>of authoritarianism in general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hell,</v>

704
00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:26.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while we've talked about so far.</v>

705
00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:32.883
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the constituent elements of the </v>

706
00:39:33.961 --> 00:39:34.794
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

707
00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:40.640
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>awesome.</v>

708
00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:49.660
<v Speaker 2>We've only talked about positive aspect </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the individual,</v>

709
00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:52.690
<v Speaker 2>not the native aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're going to talk about.</v>

710
00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:54.173
<v Speaker 2>The positive aspect of the individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>methodology is the part of that </v>

711
00:39:56.861 --> 00:39:57.694
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily admit to the existence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the unknown and that admission is a </v>

712
00:40:02.021 --> 00:40:02.854
<v Speaker 2>precondition for the next stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is creative exploration of that </v>

713
00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:06.763
<v Speaker 2>unknown and then its transformation into</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's either irrelevant or </v>

714
00:40:09.731 --> 00:40:13.870
<v Speaker 2>something beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then communication of that among the</v>

715
00:40:13.871 --> 00:40:15.940
<v Speaker 2>group while on the question is what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

716
00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:18.340
<v Speaker 2>what's the pattern that's opposite to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

717
00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:21.400
<v Speaker 2>And you can't sum it up in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a sentence or in a few words.</v>

718
00:40:21.401 --> 00:40:23.830
<v Speaker 2>It's like these other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are all natural categories.</v>

719
00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:29.070
<v Speaker 2>Natural categories are full of all sorts</v>
<v Speaker 2>of big related information so to speak,</v>

720
00:40:29.711 --> 00:40:30.544
<v Speaker 2>and I actually think this is the reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>why mythology Ken's to present these </v>

721
00:40:33.881 --> 00:40:34.714
<v Speaker 2>different domains of the world as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>forum for action as personalities </v>

722
00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:41.110
<v Speaker 2>because the personality is something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's very complex and it's got lots of</v>

723
00:40:41.111 --> 00:40:41.944
<v Speaker 2>different levels of motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of different potentials for action </v>

724
00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:48.000
<v Speaker 2>and the adversary of the hero is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality.</v>

725
00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:50.170
<v Speaker 2>Christianity left personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the devil one,</v>

726
00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:54.370
<v Speaker 2>it is the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a claim by yell yet anyways.</v>

727
00:40:54.371 --> 00:40:55.204
<v Speaker 2>Then Christy I think has the most well </v>
<v Speaker 2>developed notion of the negative aspect </v>

728
00:40:59.411 --> 00:41:04.411
<v Speaker 2>of the individual potentially arguing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>

729
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:06.880
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted you to read Milton's.</v>

730
00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:09.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the funny thing is if you look at,</v>

731
00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:11.410
<v Speaker 2>if you look in the old and New </v>
<v Speaker 2>Testament,</v>

732
00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.313
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's almost no reference at all to </v>

733
00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:18.960
<v Speaker 2>the mythological figure if the devil </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like a few sentences and that's it.</v>

734
00:41:18.961 --> 00:41:19.794
<v Speaker 2>And the entire book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean all of the methodology that we </v>

735
00:41:21.641 --> 00:41:24.000
<v Speaker 2>all vaguely know about what describes </v>
<v Speaker 2>the devil,</v>

736
00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:24.843
<v Speaker 2>that's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's dreamlike imagery that sort of </v>

737
00:41:27.011 --> 00:41:29.830
<v Speaker 2>surrounds the canonical writings of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity.</v>

738
00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:33.500
<v Speaker 2>It's all storytelling and mythologies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Milton tried to codify it.</v>

739
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:36.920
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

740
00:41:36.921 --> 00:41:38.000
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did this develop?</v>

741
00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:38.893
<v Speaker 2>And it's because people have always been</v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinated by what constitutes the </v>

742
00:41:42.891 --> 00:41:43.724
<v Speaker 2>essential aspect of evil and the theory </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we'd be discussing in this class </v>

743
00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:51.350
<v Speaker 2>suggested evil for the sake of argument.</v>

744
00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:56.240
<v Speaker 2>It's a pattern of action and a pattern </v>
<v Speaker 2>of interpretation leads to actions.</v>

745
00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:02.440
<v Speaker 2>We tend to those patterns of action,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although we see them in story form.</v>

746
00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:04.213
<v Speaker 2>First of all emerged from the forms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>behaviors and people observe the </v>

747
00:42:07.431 --> 00:42:09.800
<v Speaker 2>behaviors and told stories about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>papers and so on.</v>

748
00:42:09.801 --> 00:42:10.634
<v Speaker 2>Until we got to the point of abstraction</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we could construct an image about </v>

749
00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:15.980
<v Speaker 2>the pattern of the say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

750
00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.410
<v Speaker 2>mythological representations of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>devil.</v>

751
00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:21.980
<v Speaker 2>It's not just the devil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the negative counterpart of the hero</v>

752
00:42:21.981 --> 00:42:26.180
<v Speaker 2>throughout history are our cumulative </v>
<v Speaker 2>attempts to formulate it.</v>

753
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:31.130
<v Speaker 2>Image of the pattern of behavior and </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation that characterizes all of</v>

754
00:42:31.131 --> 00:42:35.270
<v Speaker 2>the negative aspects of the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to try to figure out what</v>

755
00:42:35.271 --> 00:42:36.800
<v Speaker 2>those attributes are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

756
00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:39.080
<v Speaker 2>one of them is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the why.</v>

757
00:42:39.081 --> 00:42:42.470
<v Speaker 2>I think perhaps the one milton stress is</v>
<v Speaker 2>above all else is pride.</v>

758
00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:44.900
<v Speaker 2>And that's refusal to admit to error.</v>

759
00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:46.760
<v Speaker 2>And what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think about</v>

760
00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:53.300
<v Speaker 2>it means that refusal to admit to error,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his refusal to admit to the existence of</v>

761
00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.910
<v Speaker 2>anomalous information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's precisely the same thing.</v>

762
00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:57.680
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

763
00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:59.223
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me to figure out too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because all you have to do is observe </v>

764
00:43:00.861 --> 00:43:01.694
<v Speaker 2>yourself in the course of an argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're arguing about someone arguing </v>

765
00:43:04.731 --> 00:43:08.910
<v Speaker 2>with someone about something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningful to you and,</v>

766
00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:11.060
<v Speaker 2>and you know what you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you know,</v>

767
00:43:11.061 --> 00:43:11.894
<v Speaker 2>sometimes they'd be either their </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument is just so much more </v>

768
00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:15.563
<v Speaker 2>destructive than New York or you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly well that the moral ground </v>

769
00:43:18.561 --> 00:43:20.510
<v Speaker 2>they stand on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's much firmer than yours.</v>

770
00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:21.140
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

771
00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:24.980
<v Speaker 2>the thing that stops you from admitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the anomalous information,</v>

772
00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:28.310
<v Speaker 2>which is actually that you're nowhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>near as good as you think you are,</v>

773
00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:29.930
<v Speaker 2>the thing that stops you use pride.</v>

774
00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:32.053
<v Speaker 5>Why is it pride and arrogance for that </v>
<v Speaker 5>matter in the context of the devil and </v>

775
00:43:35.261 --> 00:43:37.280
<v Speaker 5>who was telling the stories and what </v>
<v Speaker 5>context,</v>

776
00:43:37.281 --> 00:43:42.170
<v Speaker 5>why is it simply the refusal to submit </v>
<v Speaker 5>to the authority well into the authority</v>

777
00:43:42.171 --> 00:43:43.004
<v Speaker 5>of God?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look often white interpretation instead </v>

778
00:43:47.331 --> 00:43:48.164
<v Speaker 5>of the</v>

779
00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:51.161
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

780
00:43:51.161 --> 00:43:52.840
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

781
00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:53.823
<v Speaker 2>there's been a lot of books written </v>
<v Speaker 2>lately by Elaine Paige Hills for </v>

782
00:43:55.841 --> 00:43:58.540
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wrote a book about the devil and she</v>

783
00:43:58.541 --> 00:44:01.450
<v Speaker 2>basically said that the whole concept </v>
<v Speaker 2>was extraordinarily dangerous.</v>

784
00:44:01.451 --> 00:44:03.340
<v Speaker 2>It was primarily a Christian concept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

785
00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:04.593
<v Speaker 2>Perp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the function of the image of the devil </v>

786
00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:08.260
<v Speaker 2>was essentially to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

787
00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:09.843
<v Speaker 2>to allow Christians greater ease in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>defining and bills who didn't hold the </v>

788
00:44:17.891 --> 00:44:20.690
<v Speaker 2>same beliefs as them as an entity in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

789
00:44:20.691 --> 00:44:21.524
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see that,</v>

790
00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:23.800
<v Speaker 2>you can see the rationale in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>

791
00:44:23.801 --> 00:44:24.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

792
00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:26.440
<v Speaker 2>that's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As soon as there's a war,</v>

793
00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:28.530
<v Speaker 2>the enemy gets demonized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

794
00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:32.250
<v Speaker 2>it's not as much of a leap because a </v>
<v Speaker 2>stranger is an of chaos anyway.</v>

795
00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:35.430
<v Speaker 2>It's chaos has a reptilian aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

796
00:44:35.431 --> 00:44:36.264
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to push people very hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>before they're willing to buy that </v>

797
00:44:38.101 --> 00:44:38.934
<v Speaker 2>interpretation.</v>

798
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:43.680
<v Speaker 2>What I'm trying to say is that basically</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the least natural categories may</v>

799
00:44:43.681 --> 00:44:44.514
<v Speaker 2>tend to merge and Meld and mixed </v>
<v Speaker 2>together sort of helter skelter in our </v>

800
00:44:47.371 --> 00:44:48.204
<v Speaker 2>heads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not very well defined and they </v>

801
00:44:49.111 --> 00:44:51.510
<v Speaker 2>have fuzzy borders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's very,</v>

802
00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:52.403
<v Speaker 2>it's very simple for someone to say all </v>
<v Speaker 2>those individuals who do not accept </v>

803
00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:00.220
<v Speaker 2>established order our prime of facie </v>
<v Speaker 2>agents of the devil,</v>

804
00:45:00.221 --> 00:45:01.054
<v Speaker 2>and you can understand why they would </v>
<v Speaker 2>say that because if you don't accept </v>

805
00:45:02.971 --> 00:45:03.804
<v Speaker 2>establish order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're a threat to stability and </v>

806
00:45:05.221 --> 00:45:07.590
<v Speaker 2>you are an agent of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fine,</v>

807
00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:09.353
<v Speaker 2>but the problem with that line of </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument is that by that definition you </v>

808
00:45:13.351 --> 00:45:16.680
<v Speaker 2>can't distinguish those who update the </v>
<v Speaker 2>group from those who want to destroy it.</v>

809
00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:22.140
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that in fact quite often couch,</v>

810
00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:23.513
<v Speaker 2>yes it is difficult to tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you want to make a categorical </v>

811
00:45:25.441 --> 00:45:28.620
<v Speaker 2>statement about what constitutes the </v>
<v Speaker 2>essential aspect of evil,</v>

812
00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:29.723
<v Speaker 2>you can't say that evil is the process </v>
<v Speaker 2>that undermines the group because you </v>

813
00:45:33.241 --> 00:45:34.074
<v Speaker 2>can't distinguish the process that </v>
<v Speaker 2>undermines the group from the process </v>

814
00:45:36.391 --> 00:45:39.610
<v Speaker 2>that updates it and you know the process</v>
<v Speaker 2>that updates it is the board.</v>

815
00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:42.060
<v Speaker 2>So whatever evil is has to be something </v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

816
00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:43.493
<v Speaker 2>So like people also tend to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would also say that in the Old </v>

817
00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:49.103
<v Speaker 2>Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the great sins for the ancient </v>

818
00:45:50.611 --> 00:45:54.930
<v Speaker 2>Hebrews was making idols on go on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is essentially the say that it was</v>

819
00:45:54.931 --> 00:45:57.960
<v Speaker 2>considered immoral to categorize </v>
<v Speaker 2>something light go on.</v>

820
00:45:57.961 --> 00:46:00.390
<v Speaker 2>In terms of something that was actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>understandable,</v>

821
00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:03.690
<v Speaker 2>you always had to allow for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendent aspect of God.</v>

822
00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:04.923
<v Speaker 2>But I would say that people make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same mistake when you're discussing </v>

823
00:46:06.631 --> 00:46:08.560
<v Speaker 2>evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to make an idol out of,</v>

824
00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:11.910
<v Speaker 2>which is to say they want to make it the</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that's definable.</v>

825
00:46:11.911 --> 00:46:16.380
<v Speaker 2>So it might be the process that </v>
<v Speaker 2>undermines established order or it might</v>

826
00:46:16.381 --> 00:46:19.290
<v Speaker 2>be a aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>might be jealousy,</v>

827
00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:20.153
<v Speaker 2>might be whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because know there's all sorts of </v>

828
00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:23.183
<v Speaker 2>emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be sexual desire and that's </v>

829
00:46:24.811 --> 00:46:28.710
<v Speaker 2>being demonized time and time again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's making an idler well,</v>

830
00:46:28.711 --> 00:46:33.360
<v Speaker 2>I would say just as just as you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>regard the individual,</v>

831
00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:36.510
<v Speaker 2>no one has a thing that can be defined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as a process,</v>

832
00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:40.283
<v Speaker 2>which is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say in archaic language of </v>

833
00:46:42.101 --> 00:46:42.934
<v Speaker 2>spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you also have to do the same thing with </v>

834
00:46:44.641 --> 00:46:47.700
<v Speaker 2>the negative aspect of the individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

835
00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:49.573
<v Speaker 2>No one other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's the process by which an almost </v>

836
00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:56.680
<v Speaker 2>inflammation has rejected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is that a reasonable answer?</v>

837
00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:00.420
<v Speaker 2>Does that satisfy your question?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

838
00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:01.283
<v Speaker 2>the thing is low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's confusing and what we're trying to </v>

839
00:47:03.181 --> 00:47:04.014
<v Speaker 2>do to some degree is clear up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>boundaries of these natural categories </v>

840
00:47:06.271 --> 00:47:09.710
<v Speaker 2>because it's very easy for the figure of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the devil,</v>

841
00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:13.320
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to take on the aspects of the tyrannical</v>

842
00:47:13.321 --> 00:47:17.400
<v Speaker 2>aspects of a border and also the </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative aspects of chaos.</v>

843
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:18.263
<v Speaker 2>I mean Girtha described the devil knows </v>
<v Speaker 2>the strange son of chaos and we tend to </v>

844
00:47:21.421 --> 00:47:25.830
<v Speaker 2>think of anything that's at the moment </v>
<v Speaker 2>negatively valence as evil.</v>

845
00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:27.110
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an,</v>

846
00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:32.150
<v Speaker 2>that's just an example of fuzzy thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>and w w w what since we're trying to get</v>

847
00:47:32.501 --> 00:47:35.740
<v Speaker 2>out the basis of what constitutes </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivations for social conflict here,</v>

848
00:47:35.741 --> 00:47:38.320
<v Speaker 2>it's very useful to start clarifying up </v>
<v Speaker 2>the descriptions.</v>

849
00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:40.780
<v Speaker 2>We can't say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the unknown is evil.</v>

850
00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:41.823
<v Speaker 2>That's not any good because although </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very dangerous if you don't have </v>

851
00:47:44.291 --> 00:47:47.830
<v Speaker 2>any around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you come to a halt and you can't say,</v>

852
00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:49.840
<v Speaker 2>well cultures evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although you can say,</v>

853
00:47:49.841 --> 00:47:52.810
<v Speaker 2>well it tends towards authoritarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a problem.</v>

854
00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:55.150
<v Speaker 2>It also provides you with necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>security.</v>

855
00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:59.140
<v Speaker 2>You can't say that the process that </v>
<v Speaker 2>transforms orders,</v>

856
00:47:59.141 --> 00:48:03.130
<v Speaker 2>he believe it because although it can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>very upsetting if you don't have it,</v>

857
00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:07.790
<v Speaker 2>you come to a halt as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So by process of elimination and sense,</v>

858
00:48:07.791 --> 00:48:11.410
<v Speaker 2>your left to the questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can you define as evil?</v>

859
00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:13.660
<v Speaker 2>Where does it go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Assuming need exists?</v>

860
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:17.240
<v Speaker 2>Assuming an exist is a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it depends on your death.</v>

861
00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:18.310
<v Speaker 2>It exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

862
00:48:18.311 --> 00:48:20.810
<v Speaker 2>cause there's some news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

863
00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:25.090
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't just exist as a religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstraction and we know that it exists.</v>

864
00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:26.073
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's why we have things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Nuremberg trials and that's why we </v>

865
00:48:28.331 --> 00:48:30.520
<v Speaker 2>have things like Holocaust museum in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington.</v>

866
00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:34.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean even though we're not very good </v>
<v Speaker 2>at defining it and we don't exactly know</v>

867
00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:39.540
<v Speaker 2>what it means when it occurs</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in in terms of consensus,</v>

868
00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:41.913
<v Speaker 2>people can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So hopefully what we can do is try to </v>

869
00:48:45.431 --> 00:48:46.264
<v Speaker 2>figure out what it is and what it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's easy to say if I'm part of </v>

870
00:48:49.361 --> 00:48:50.194
<v Speaker 2>Group Bank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all members of Group B are Evil and you </v>

871
00:48:52.721 --> 00:48:54.940
<v Speaker 2>can understand why there's motivation to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

872
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:56.263
<v Speaker 2>Like Group B poses a real threat to </v>
<v Speaker 2>group bates non trivial threat has </v>

873
00:48:59.441 --> 00:49:02.410
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with their moral nature in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sense.</v>

874
00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:05.260
<v Speaker 2>And it's very easy for people to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>that presumption.</v>

875
00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:06.573
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things I want to do is </v>
<v Speaker 2>clear up the categories so that it's no </v>

876
00:49:10.271 --> 00:49:11.104
<v Speaker 2>longer possible to rationalize the </v>
<v Speaker 2>notion that just because you're a part </v>

877
00:49:14.291 --> 00:49:17.330
<v Speaker 2>of Group B and I'm part of Group A,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you as a member of group,</v>

878
00:49:17.331 --> 00:49:20.050
<v Speaker 2>we are necessarily evil and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily all good.</v>

879
00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:21.633
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in a sense when you label another </v>

880
00:49:24.161 --> 00:49:26.410
<v Speaker 2>group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you say that group is the devil,</v>

881
00:49:26.411 --> 00:49:28.570
<v Speaker 2>you're sort of taking on the devil more </v>
<v Speaker 2>protective stuff.</v>

882
00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:30.540
<v Speaker 2>Well I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I I,</v>

883
00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:34.630
<v Speaker 2>I would say that that's necessarily the </v>
<v Speaker 2>case here as soon as,</v>

884
00:49:34.631 --> 00:49:38.380
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you adopt because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's one aspect of it.</v>

885
00:49:38.381 --> 00:49:39.214
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the inappropriate adoption of </v>

886
00:49:41.261 --> 00:49:42.720
<v Speaker 2>omniscience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like level,</v>

887
00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:47.710
<v Speaker 2>let's say you can even know it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary for me to protect my group and</v>

888
00:49:47.711 --> 00:49:49.840
<v Speaker 2>also that my group is valuable to </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

889
00:49:49.841 --> 00:49:50.674
<v Speaker 2>which for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever you would never create any </v>

890
00:49:52.361 --> 00:49:54.430
<v Speaker 2>debate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know the function of group.</v>

891
00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:57.820
<v Speaker 2>The problem is when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you say one,</v>

892
00:49:57.970 --> 00:50:00.750
<v Speaker 2>I personally am actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

893
00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:05.890
<v Speaker 2>what would you say the most admirable </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible exponent of wine group,</v>

894
00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:06.903
<v Speaker 2>which means first of all that I actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand its structure and that given </v>

895
00:50:10.901 --> 00:50:11.734
<v Speaker 2>such understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually acted out both of which are </v>

896
00:50:13.541 --> 00:50:14.374
<v Speaker 2>highly debatable propositions and also </v>
<v Speaker 2>that my understanding of my group </v>

897
00:50:18.281 --> 00:50:19.114
<v Speaker 2>processes is sufficiently profound for </v>
<v Speaker 2>me to determine what the absolute </v>

898
00:50:21.611 --> 00:50:24.580
<v Speaker 2>certainty that you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That for me,</v>

899
00:50:24.581 --> 00:50:26.620
<v Speaker 2>that's arrogance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's pride.</v>

900
00:50:26.621 --> 00:50:29.190
<v Speaker 2>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the underground adoption of,</v>

901
00:50:29.191 --> 00:50:31.340
<v Speaker 2>and I'm missing steps soon as you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

902
00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:34.250
<v Speaker 2>Well there are certain consequences </v>
<v Speaker 2>which</v>

903
00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:37.030
<v Speaker 5>detail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Man,</v>

904
00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:37.943
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

905
00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:39.093
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm confused.</v>

906
00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:39.933
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have the positive part of the </v>

907
00:50:41.711 --> 00:50:43.730
<v Speaker 4>individual as somebody who accepts a </v>
<v Speaker 4>nonlinear,</v>

908
00:50:43.770 --> 00:50:44.603
<v Speaker 4>we had the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the negative individual how do the </v>

909
00:50:46.331 --> 00:50:48.130
<v Speaker 4>individual as a process that rejects </v>
<v Speaker 4>anomalies.</v>

910
00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:50.950
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we've already discussed the positive</v>

911
00:50:50.951 --> 00:50:52.090
<v Speaker 4>part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

912
00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:52.983
<v Speaker 4>update society and yet we've also </v>
<v Speaker 4>discussed how the negative part is a </v>

913
00:50:55.811 --> 00:50:58.240
<v Speaker 4>process that also a bait society,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

914
00:50:58.480 --> 00:50:58.991
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>through,</v>

915
00:50:58.991 --> 00:51:00.340
<v Speaker 4>through fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The devil,</v>

916
00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:01.553
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>updates.</v>

917
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:03.380
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

918
00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:04.213
<v Speaker 2>The idea here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of essentially was that if </v>

919
00:51:06.741 --> 00:51:07.574
<v Speaker 2>you're in a group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like say you're the spoke of a </v>

920
00:51:10.161 --> 00:51:14.570
<v Speaker 2>particular group from within the group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult for you to determine</v>

921
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:18.830
<v Speaker 2>the difference between the power of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to just lay the group to waste and</v>

922
00:51:18.831 --> 00:51:21.350
<v Speaker 2>the power that we'll update it cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>they look very much the same,</v>

923
00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:26.180
<v Speaker 2>which is why revolutionary heroes who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are often heretical are so badly treated</v>

924
00:51:26.181 --> 00:51:28.650
<v Speaker 2>by group members.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's because they're dead.</v>

925
00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:31.610
<v Speaker 2>They're indistinguishable from random </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintenance of chaos from,</v>

926
00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:33.980
<v Speaker 2>well at least for less than </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinguishable.</v>

927
00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:34.963
<v Speaker 2>Usually I think you can tell the </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference but people are not </v>

928
00:51:36.411 --> 00:51:37.244
<v Speaker 2>necessarily willing to.</v>

929
00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:40.350
<v Speaker 4>It was minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

930
00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:41.193
<v Speaker 4>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we're still saying that the negative </v>

931
00:51:43.321 --> 00:51:45.450
<v Speaker 4>part of the individual is the one that </v>
<v Speaker 4>rejects anomaly,</v>

932
00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.160
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Knowing that it's there,</v>

933
00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.830
<v Speaker 2>knowing that it's there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the second one,</v>

934
00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:54.870
<v Speaker 2>something occurs</v>
<v Speaker 2>and at least at one level of analysis,</v>

935
00:51:54.871 --> 00:51:58.300
<v Speaker 2>you know that it's undermining one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your theories and you say it,</v>

936
00:51:58.370 --> 00:51:59.203
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

937
00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:05.100
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think given that the individual is the</v>

938
00:52:05.561 --> 00:52:06.394
<v Speaker 5>houses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the positive aspect of the individual </v>

939
00:52:08.961 --> 00:52:09.794
<v Speaker 5>would be an aggressive like means toward</v>
<v Speaker 5>the unknown which would be the hero and </v>

940
00:52:14.301 --> 00:52:19.301
<v Speaker 5>then the negative would be the group or </v>
<v Speaker 5>the culture which is instant.</v>

941
00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:21.073
<v Speaker 2>Well it's partly that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's why in the diag for that </v>

942
00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:25.113
<v Speaker 2>growing the relationship has always been</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this cause because the negative </v>

943
00:52:28.161 --> 00:52:33.161
<v Speaker 2>aspect of the individual heightens the </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic danger of the group,</v>

944
00:52:33.771 --> 00:52:34.604
<v Speaker 2>which is to say that if you take a group</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's entirely composed of individuals </v>

945
00:52:38.091 --> 00:52:40.790
<v Speaker 2>who reject it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>normally what you have is a tyranny.</v>

946
00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:42.073
<v Speaker 2>So to the degree that the group is </v>
<v Speaker 2>composed of individuals who reject the </v>

947
00:52:45.081 --> 00:52:45.914
<v Speaker 2>normally it will become integrity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that we're trying to </v>

948
00:52:48.591 --> 00:52:49.424
<v Speaker 2>discuss in this class and to formulate </v>
<v Speaker 2>overtime is it the relationship between </v>

949
00:52:52.131 --> 00:52:54.320
<v Speaker 2>individual action and group </v>
<v Speaker 2>identification,</v>

950
00:52:54.321 --> 00:52:55.154
<v Speaker 2>which is to say like what can you do to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ensure that your group does not only </v>

951
00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:03.560
<v Speaker 2>your group tending towards tyranny as it</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily will,</v>

952
00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:06.770
<v Speaker 2>will not absolutely transform itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>into tyranny over time.</v>

953
00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:07.723
<v Speaker 2>And the only thing you can do as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual is to ensure that when an </v>

954
00:53:11.511 --> 00:53:12.344
<v Speaker 2>anomalous piece of information pops its </v>
<v Speaker 2>ugly head up and makes you realize that </v>

955
00:53:15.711 --> 00:53:16.544
<v Speaker 2>you're vulnerable and mortal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you admit to its presence and take </v>

956
00:53:20.121 --> 00:53:23.480
<v Speaker 2>the necessary action,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever those actions happen to be.</v>

957
00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:26.730
<v Speaker 2>Now the problem is under some </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances that doing so will be very</v>

958
00:53:26.731 --> 00:53:27.564
<v Speaker 2>dangerous to you.</v>

959
00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:32.180
<v Speaker 5>That's essentially what culture is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Culture is protect is protecting.</v>

960
00:53:32.181 --> 00:53:35.330
<v Speaker 5>You are denying that which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

961
00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:36.470
<v Speaker 5>can threaten to you.</v>

962
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Well that's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also,</v>

963
00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:40.200
<v Speaker 2>that's only part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also,</v>

964
00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:43.860
<v Speaker 2>I think to think of it as a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to put it in its personality,</v>

965
00:53:43.861 --> 00:53:44.694
<v Speaker 2>guys is very accurate because of parent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both protects you but exposes you at a </v>

966
00:53:49.171 --> 00:53:51.390
<v Speaker 2>rate that you can tolerate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

967
00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:55.170
<v Speaker 2>one of the things we're going to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about at the end of this class is how,</v>

968
00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:58.890
<v Speaker 2>how you can tell if you're being exposed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the unknown at the proper rate.</v>

969
00:53:59.130 --> 00:53:59.963
<v Speaker 2>And I would say just in passing that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can tell when you're doing something </v>

970
00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:05.520
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting to you that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningful.</v>

971
00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:06.413
<v Speaker 2>That's the indication that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>sufficiently secure so that you're not </v>

972
00:54:10.741 --> 00:54:11.574
<v Speaker 2>going to fall apart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also sufficiently open so that your </v>

973
00:54:13.891 --> 00:54:14.724
<v Speaker 2>stability will be maintained over time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way that manifests itself is in the </v>

974
00:54:17.911 --> 00:54:18.744
<v Speaker 2>feeling of interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when self consciousness vanishes </v>

975
00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:24.030
<v Speaker 2>in part and time tends to disappear as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

976
00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:26.820
<v Speaker 2>so therefore can the hero be part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>group?</v>

977
00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:30.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hero's necessarily what the hero has</v>

978
00:54:30.031 --> 00:54:30.864
<v Speaker 2>to be from</v>

979
00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:31.863
<v Speaker 5>heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the group.</v>

980
00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.860
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

981
00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:33.753
<v Speaker 5>But the hero can't necessarily can know </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the hero identify with the group </v>

982
00:54:37.421 --> 00:54:38.660
<v Speaker 5>while still being a euro.</v>

983
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:40.410
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

984
00:54:40.411 --> 00:54:41.244
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a matter of recognition of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the value of the group and also the </v>

985
00:54:44.161 --> 00:54:45.690
<v Speaker 2>necessity of its being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

986
00:54:45.691 --> 00:54:46.524
<v Speaker 2>Without saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without trying to get from childhood to </v>

987
00:54:49.231 --> 00:54:50.064
<v Speaker 2>individually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about any group intermediation </v>

988
00:54:51.541 --> 00:54:55.020
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever or without saying that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>group is the be all and end all,</v>

989
00:54:55.021 --> 00:54:55.854
<v Speaker 2>which is what all groups wanted you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say about them or without saying that </v>

990
00:54:58.171 --> 00:55:00.690
<v Speaker 2>the group is only an impediment to </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuality,</v>

991
00:55:00.691 --> 00:55:01.524
<v Speaker 2>which is just not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also a precondition so it's more a </v>

992
00:55:03.871 --> 00:55:06.270
<v Speaker 2>matter of appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

993
00:55:06.271 --> 00:55:07.980
<v Speaker 2>here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a really good,</v>

994
00:55:08.070 --> 00:55:08.903
<v Speaker 2>this is a good little parable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's from the gnostic gospels that were </v>

995
00:55:11.791 --> 00:55:16.791
<v Speaker 2>discovered in the late 1950s.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ is walking down the road and it's</v>

996
00:55:17.221 --> 00:55:18.690
<v Speaker 2>Sunday or Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

997
00:55:18.691 --> 00:55:20.600
<v Speaker 2>it's the Sabbath Day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

998
00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:24.510
<v Speaker 2>there's a man in a ditch and his sheep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his fallen into a hole and he's,</v>

999
00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:25.493
<v Speaker 2>he's picking the sheep out of the hole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you're not supposed to do on the </v>

1000
00:55:27.871 --> 00:55:30.720
<v Speaker 2>sabbath because by prostitutes were in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ test.</v>

1001
00:55:30.730 --> 00:55:32.940
<v Speaker 2>And Amanda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you know what you're doing,</v>

1002
00:55:32.941 --> 00:55:34.260
<v Speaker 2>then you're blessed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't,</v>

1003
00:55:34.261 --> 00:55:36.810
<v Speaker 2>you're a transgressor of the law and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're cursed.</v>

1004
00:55:37.350 --> 00:55:38.183
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he wants you saw him down the </v>

1005
00:55:38.881 --> 00:55:39.760
<v Speaker 2>road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's like,</v>

1006
00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:40.703
<v Speaker 2>that's really quite an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophical position because he said </v>

1007
00:55:43.861 --> 00:55:44.694
<v Speaker 2>to the man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1008
00:55:44.730 --> 00:55:48.960
<v Speaker 2>if you actually understand the </v>
<v Speaker 2>significance of your actions,</v>

1009
00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:50.123
<v Speaker 2>which has bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're breaking a moral rule that's </v>

1010
00:55:51.361 --> 00:55:53.190
<v Speaker 2>there for a reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1011
00:55:53.191 --> 00:55:54.024
<v Speaker 2>the reason why the rule is there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you appreciate its necessity and you've </v>

1012
00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:59.700
<v Speaker 2>decided as a consequence of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciation,</v>

1013
00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:02.880
<v Speaker 2>it's still worthwhile to par the sheep </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the hole.</v>

1014
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:05.760
<v Speaker 2>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if it's just a casual gesture,</v>

1015
00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:10.290
<v Speaker 2>you know there's something wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you think and you'll pay for it.</v>

1016
00:56:10.291 --> 00:56:14.940
<v Speaker 2>So really it's a nice little story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in fact,</v>

1017
00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:16.830
<v Speaker 2>there are a number of parables in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>New Testament.</v>

1018
00:56:16.831 --> 00:56:21.600
<v Speaker 2>They're very much like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not so it's very simple.</v>

1019
00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:26.140
<v Speaker 2>It's a very powerful little story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

1020
00:56:26.141 --> 00:56:30.460
<v Speaker 2>I want to read you a Buddhist myth </v>
<v Speaker 2>briefly because it will,</v>

1021
00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:32.130
<v Speaker 2>it will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1022
00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:33.153
<v Speaker 2>put into story form some of the ideas </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been trying to describe to you </v>

1023
00:56:36.371 --> 00:56:37.204
<v Speaker 2>about the relationship between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>development of self consciousness and </v>

1024
00:56:39.461 --> 00:56:42.070
<v Speaker 2>the contamination of things with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea of death.</v>

1025
00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:43.600
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before you start,</v>

1026
00:56:43.601 --> 00:56:46.570
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to ask you something </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's been bothering me,</v>

1027
00:56:46.571 --> 00:56:47.720
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1028
00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:49.173
<v Speaker 1>our reference to the identification of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual with the process rather </v>

1029
00:56:53.291 --> 00:56:55.540
<v Speaker 1>than to the individual sort of as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

1030
00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:56.593
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing that strikes me is that the </v>

1031
00:56:58.601 --> 00:56:59.434
<v Speaker 1>group is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be no more than a bunch of </v>

1032
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:04.960
<v Speaker 1>individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1033
00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:06.550
<v Speaker 1>I grew group is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a way of,</v>

1034
00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:07.593
<v Speaker 1>it's an abstraction that that puts a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of individuals who are similar </v>

1035
00:57:12.490 --> 00:57:15.550
<v Speaker 1>together there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And furthermore,</v>

1036
00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:16.623
<v Speaker 1>an individual is not the process unless </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's already has something to work the </v>

1037
00:57:21.701 --> 00:57:22.780
<v Speaker 1>process on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1038
00:57:23.050 --> 00:57:24.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

1039
00:57:24.850 --> 00:57:29.540
<v Speaker 1>the known is as much a part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual as the process is fine.</v>

1040
00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:32.850
<v Speaker 1>That's a perfectly good objection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the Arctic individual,</v>

1041
00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:34.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>

1042
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.150
<v Speaker 2>this is a map of experience in total,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing.</v>

1043
00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:39.013
<v Speaker 2>And you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you're the sum total of your </v>

1044
00:57:40.011 --> 00:57:40.844
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which basically means that there's an </v>

1045
00:57:42.051 --> 00:57:42.884
<v Speaker 2>aspect of you that's characterized by</v>
<v Speaker 2>both participation in the unknown and </v>

1046
00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:49.693
<v Speaker 2>the consequences of being exposed to it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the group inside you and the </v>

1047
00:57:54.051 --> 00:57:54.884
<v Speaker 2>architect will individually inside you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as we are all these things and the </v>

1048
00:57:57.231 --> 00:57:59.240
<v Speaker 2>grow your experience or your </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences,</v>

1049
00:57:59.241 --> 00:58:00.770
<v Speaker 2>all of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can say,</v>

1050
00:58:00.771 --> 00:58:02.630
<v Speaker 2>I am my experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1051
00:58:02.631 --> 00:58:03.840
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason,</v>

1052
00:58:04.170 --> 00:58:05.003
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the architectural rep </v>

1053
00:58:06.330 --> 00:58:07.163
<v Speaker 2>representations of the individuals that </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitute the process because there's </v>

1054
00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:13.890
<v Speaker 2>archetypical representation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wise king for example,</v>

1055
00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:17.950
<v Speaker 2>that's an individual who just occupies a</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the whole,</v>

1056
00:58:18.590 --> 00:58:21.600
<v Speaker 2>the whole of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of all of experience.</v>

1057
00:58:22.170 --> 00:58:23.003
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean what got me into this to begin </v>

1058
00:58:25.021 --> 00:58:25.950
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in part,</v>

1059
00:58:25.951 --> 00:58:28.650
<v Speaker 2>was the recognition that to the degree </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's a group,</v>

1060
00:58:28.770 --> 00:58:29.640
<v Speaker 2>it's in your head.</v>

1061
00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:30.661
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1062
00:58:30.661 --> 00:58:33.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean because it is an abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like people,</v>

1063
00:58:33.061 --> 00:58:34.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see people,</v>

1064
00:58:34.321 --> 00:58:35.790
<v Speaker 2>you go to the Canadian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the u s border,</v>

1065
00:58:35.791 --> 00:58:36.624
<v Speaker 2>they get out of the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they look at the border because they </v>

1066
00:58:37.951 --> 00:58:40.230
<v Speaker 2>think the motors on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't.</v>

1067
00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:41.873
<v Speaker 2>It's in their head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have it confused with actual </v>

1068
00:58:43.801 --> 00:58:46.830
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the group isn't in the same way.</v>

1069
00:58:46.831 --> 00:58:47.664
<v Speaker 2>I mean the group is an intra psychic is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that has an interest psychic </v>

1070
00:58:51.721 --> 00:58:52.554
<v Speaker 2>incarnation and as part of the reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>that this course is called socialites </v>

1071
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:56.103
<v Speaker 2>got a terrible title.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called social identity and </v>

1072
00:58:58.531 --> 00:58:59.364
<v Speaker 2>information processing because social </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity plays a role in the way you </v>

1073
00:59:03.061 --> 00:59:05.910
<v Speaker 2>process information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's incarnated inside you,</v>

1074
00:59:05.911 --> 00:59:07.410
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1075
00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:08.273
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I've just been seeing him every </v>

1076
00:59:09.091 --> 00:59:11.610
<v Speaker 2>once in a while in this class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like we're confusing the arc to</v>

1077
00:59:11.970 --> 00:59:15.250
<v Speaker 2>the archetypes with actual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1078
00:59:15.450 --> 00:59:15.961
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1079
00:59:15.961 --> 00:59:17.880
<v Speaker 2>and then not to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That may be the case as well.</v>

1080
00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:19.673
<v Speaker 2>I guess part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess maybe that emergency in part </v>

1081
00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:24.080
<v Speaker 2>people's natural tendency is to identify</v>
<v Speaker 2>them more,</v>

1082
00:59:24.081 --> 00:59:27.530
<v Speaker 2>particularly with the group and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>counter balance that.</v>

1083
00:59:27.531 --> 00:59:30.060
<v Speaker 2>I guess I'm trying to put more stress on</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1084
00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:33.770
<v Speaker 2>this aspect and perhaps even someone on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1085
00:59:33.940 --> 00:59:35.910
<v Speaker 2>the</v>
<v Speaker 2>negative,</v>

1086
00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:43.610
<v Speaker 2>the negative switched on.</v>

1087
00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:48.260
<v Speaker 2>You've gotten both from above of young </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuns are positive.</v>

1088
00:59:49.230 --> 00:59:50.063
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice.</v>

1089
00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:51.840
<v Speaker 2>That's a good problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

1090
00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:56.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive.</v>

1091
01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:01.470
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1092
01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:06.410
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let me read you this story.</v>

1093
01:00:10.330 --> 01:00:12.950
<v Speaker 2>What I want you to do is to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you maybe read it.</v>

1094
01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:14.623
<v Speaker 2>What I want you to do is to think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it in terms of the categories that you </v>

1095
01:00:17.601 --> 01:00:18.930
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you should be able to figure out</v>

1096
01:00:18.931 --> 01:00:19.880
<v Speaker 2>what story means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1097
01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:25.560
<v Speaker 2>the father of Prince Gautama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Buddha savior of the Orient,</v>

1098
01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:28.850
<v Speaker 2>determined to protect his son from </v>
<v Speaker 2>desperate knowledge and tragic awareness</v>

1099
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:33.110
<v Speaker 2>built for him and enclosed pavilion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a walled garden of earthly delights.</v>

1100
01:00:34.610 --> 01:00:36.950
<v Speaker 2>Walled Garden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

1101
01:00:38.090 --> 01:00:39.050
<v Speaker 2>means paradise.</v>

1102
01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:43.070
<v Speaker 2>Only the healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the young and the happy.</v>

1103
01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:45.380
<v Speaker 2>We're allowed access to this earthly </v>
<v Speaker 2>fair.</v>

1104
01:00:45.381 --> 01:00:46.214
<v Speaker 2>That's all signs of decay and </v>
<v Speaker 2>degeneration were kept hidden from the </v>

1105
01:00:49.731 --> 01:00:53.880
<v Speaker 2>prints.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you remember what,</v>

1106
01:00:53.881 --> 01:00:57.650
<v Speaker 2>what food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his father had been visited by an oracle</v>

1107
01:00:57.651 --> 01:00:58.484
<v Speaker 2>and the Oracle told him that his son was</v>
<v Speaker 2>either going to grow up to be a great </v>

1108
01:01:00.531 --> 01:01:04.040
<v Speaker 2>religious leader or a leader of like an </v>
<v Speaker 2>earthly leader,</v>

1109
01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:04.933
<v Speaker 2>politician.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically his father wanted him to be a </v>

1110
01:01:07.041 --> 01:01:07.874
<v Speaker 2>politician,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he was trying to keep him away from </v>

1111
01:01:10.311 --> 01:01:13.130
<v Speaker 2>anything that would lead them towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>more spiritual concerns.</v>

1112
01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:14.203
<v Speaker 2>So you could say in a sense go Thomas </v>
<v Speaker 2>Farley wanted him to identify with the </v>

1113
01:01:17.211 --> 01:01:21.230
<v Speaker 2>group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is perfectly reasonable.</v>

1114
01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:23.233
<v Speaker 2>So he built this wall enclosure and </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside it we're only things that were </v>

1115
01:01:27.111 --> 01:01:28.550
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything terrible.</v>

1116
01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:29.393
<v Speaker 2>It was kept outside immersed in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediate pleasures of the census in </v>

1117
01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:35.330
<v Speaker 2>physical law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dance and music and beauty.</v>

1118
01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:36.253
<v Speaker 2>Azure Gautama grew the maturity </v>
<v Speaker 2>protected absolutely from the </v>

1119
01:01:38.661 --> 01:01:41.000
<v Speaker 2>limitations of portal being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

1120
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:41.983
<v Speaker 2>he grew up curious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite his father's most particular </v>

1121
01:01:44.871 --> 01:01:47.990
<v Speaker 2>attention and will and resolve to leave </v>
<v Speaker 2>is seductive prison.</v>

1122
01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:53.320
<v Speaker 2>He wanted to find out what was beyond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as far the main preparations to,</v>

1123
01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:56.930
<v Speaker 2>I think this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1124
01:01:56.931 --> 01:01:57.764
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was a procedure that was often </v>

1125
01:02:00.741 --> 01:02:02.300
<v Speaker 2>fault,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fault in the Soviet Union,</v>

1126
01:02:02.301 --> 01:02:04.190
<v Speaker 2>I think it was called a Potemkin </v>
<v Speaker 2>village.</v>

1127
01:02:04.191 --> 01:02:05.660
<v Speaker 2>You've heard him correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that right?</v>

1128
01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:06.533
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm from tech village was a village </v>

1129
01:02:07.731 --> 01:02:09.800
<v Speaker 2>that the Soviets would construct a full,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid,</v>

1130
01:02:09.801 --> 01:02:12.350
<v Speaker 2>gullible Westerners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Soviets would say,</v>

1131
01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:13.213
<v Speaker 2>we have a wonderful society come and </v>
<v Speaker 2>looks that they construct this </v>

1132
01:02:15.171 --> 01:02:16.520
<v Speaker 2>beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it happened to be,</v>

1133
01:02:16.521 --> 01:02:17.354
<v Speaker 2>prison camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the Westerners would come with him </v>

1134
01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:21.900
<v Speaker 2>and everyone would look at that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy and the western is,</v>

1135
01:02:21.901 --> 01:02:23.210
<v Speaker 2>would go back home and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this will be,</v>

1136
01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.113
<v Speaker 2>aren't so bad.</v>

1137
01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:25.740
<v Speaker 2>Look at this model prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

1138
01:02:25.741 --> 01:02:26.574
<v Speaker 2>that was a Potemkin village and Thomas </v>
<v Speaker 2>Farley as basically trying to do the </v>

1139
01:02:29.191 --> 01:02:31.510
<v Speaker 2>same thing here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he wants to get outside of the wall.</v>

1140
01:02:31.511 --> 01:02:32.344
<v Speaker 2>So his father like whitewashed yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the shacks and gets the beggars and </v>

1141
01:02:36.751 --> 01:02:39.600
<v Speaker 2>everyone off the street and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little root carved out.</v>

1142
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:41.640
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the first trip.</v>

1143
01:02:42.030 --> 01:02:47.030
<v Speaker 2>So he covers his path with flowers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>displays alongside the road,</v>

1144
01:02:47.491 --> 01:02:48.324
<v Speaker 2>the fairest women of the kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The print sets out with all of his </v>

1145
01:02:52.621 --> 01:02:55.020
<v Speaker 2>retinue in the shield and comfort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaperone,</v>

1146
01:02:55.021 --> 01:02:58.500
<v Speaker 2>chariot and delights in the panorama </v>
<v Speaker 2>prepared for him.</v>

1147
01:02:58.501 --> 01:03:00.510
<v Speaker 2>So things fall outside world is not so </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>

1148
01:03:00.930 --> 01:03:01.741
<v Speaker 2>The gods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>

1149
01:03:01.741 --> 01:03:02.574
<v Speaker 2>decided to disrupt these most carefully </v>
<v Speaker 2>laid plans and sent an agent man to </v>

1150
01:03:06.361 --> 01:03:07.194
<v Speaker 2>hobble in full view alongside the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Prince as fascinated gaze fell upon the </v>

1151
01:03:11.801 --> 01:03:14.490
<v Speaker 2>ancient into local compelled by </v>
<v Speaker 2>curiosity.</v>

1152
01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:18.330
<v Speaker 2>He asked his attendant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that creature stumbling,</v>

1153
01:03:18.331 --> 01:03:22.380
<v Speaker 2>shabby bent and broken beside my revenue</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the attendant answer.</v>

1154
01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:26.620
<v Speaker 2>That's a man like a man who was born in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the infant became a child.</v>

1155
01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:27.750
<v Speaker 2>Youth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a husband,</v>

1156
01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:29.250
<v Speaker 2>father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>father,</v>

1157
01:03:29.251 --> 01:03:30.084
<v Speaker 2>fathers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's become old subject to destruction </v>

1158
01:03:32.881 --> 01:03:35.310
<v Speaker 2>of his beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his well in the possibilities of life.</v>

1159
01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:39.390
<v Speaker 2>Like other menu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say hesitantly acquired the brands.</v>

1160
01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:44.580
<v Speaker 2>That means this will happen to me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the attendant answer inevitably with the</v>

1161
01:03:44.581 --> 01:03:48.120
<v Speaker 2>passage of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of piece of anomalous information.</v>

1162
01:03:48.270 --> 01:03:51.570
<v Speaker 2>What happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like back to the walled city.</v>

1163
01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:54.023
<v Speaker 2>The world collapsed in upon guitar and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he has to be returned to the safety of </v>

1164
01:03:57.091 --> 01:03:57.924
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a story about creative </v>

1165
01:03:59.821 --> 01:04:02.080
<v Speaker 2>exploration and that's exactly how </v>
<v Speaker 2>children offered.</v>

1166
01:04:02.970 --> 01:04:03.803
<v Speaker 2>They use their parents as a stable base </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the explore outside that base of </v>

1167
01:04:07.681 --> 01:04:08.514
<v Speaker 2>stability to the limits of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>tolerance for anxiety and when that </v>

1168
01:04:11.491 --> 01:04:12.324
<v Speaker 2>cards is exceeded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go back to their parents and the </v>

1169
01:04:14.281 --> 01:04:15.114
<v Speaker 2>whole exploratory procedure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is in fact the procedure that </v>

1170
01:04:17.581 --> 01:04:18.414
<v Speaker 2>leads to maturation is a constant </v>
<v Speaker 2>interplay of moving out and coming back </v>

1171
01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:25.860
<v Speaker 2>and moving out and coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Theoretically each move out,</v>

1172
01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:26.783
<v Speaker 2>being slightly farther out as the child </v>
<v Speaker 2>learns that he can in fact tolerate </v>

1173
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:31.703
<v Speaker 2>exposure to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the unknown world outside of the </v>

1174
01:04:33.931 --> 01:04:34.764
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>

1175
01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:37.373
<v Speaker 2>So you got home as far the bills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>him a walled city and only good things </v>

1176
01:04:40.051 --> 01:04:40.884
<v Speaker 2>are inside of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what we do for our </v>

1177
01:04:42.121 --> 01:04:43.260
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally.</v>

1178
01:04:43.261 --> 01:04:47.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean what you do if you have a child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you treat the child properly,</v>

1179
01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:52.140
<v Speaker 2>is to protect it from all those forms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>anomalous information that it,</v>

1180
01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:53.093
<v Speaker 2>that it cannot by any stroke of </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagination deal with so you know the </v>

1181
01:04:59.691 --> 01:05:03.840
<v Speaker 2>for or even understand for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's all sorts of things that you</v>

1182
01:05:03.841 --> 01:05:07.680
<v Speaker 2>don't discuss with children unless the </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessity arises and it's absolutely,</v>

1183
01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:12.390
<v Speaker 2>it's absolutely necessary and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it means to take care of them.</v>

1184
01:05:12.391 --> 01:05:13.950
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the same token,</v>

1185
01:05:13.951 --> 01:05:14.784
<v Speaker 2>you don't shield them from those things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they are capable of actually </v>

1186
01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:22.110
<v Speaker 2>conquering anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's back home in time.</v>

1187
01:05:22.541 --> 01:05:23.374
<v Speaker 2>His anxiety lessens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his curiosity grows and the adventures </v>

1188
01:05:26.591 --> 01:05:27.424
<v Speaker 2>outside again because time to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sent a sick man to view this </v>

1189
01:05:31.151 --> 01:05:31.570
<v Speaker 2>creature.</v>

1190
01:05:31.570 --> 01:05:34.870
<v Speaker 2>He asked his attended shaking and palsy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horribly afflicted,</v>

1191
01:05:35.230 --> 01:05:38.350
<v Speaker 2>unbearable to behold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a source of pity and contempt.</v>

1192
01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:39.213
<v Speaker 2>What is he and the attendant answered </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a man like other men who was </v>

1193
01:05:42.221 --> 01:05:45.430
<v Speaker 2>born hold but who became ill and sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unable to cope,</v>

1194
01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:49.990
<v Speaker 2>a burden to himself and others suffering</v>
<v Speaker 2>and incurable like other men,</v>

1195
01:05:49.991 --> 01:05:50.824
<v Speaker 2>you say acquire the prints.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This could happen to me and the </v>

1196
01:05:52.961 --> 01:05:53.794
<v Speaker 2>attendant answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no man is exempt from the ravages of </v>

1197
01:05:55.601 --> 01:05:56.680
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>

1198
01:05:56.681 --> 01:05:57.514
<v Speaker 2>this is a story about the development of</v>
<v Speaker 2>self consciousness because what Gautama </v>

1199
01:06:01.091 --> 01:06:01.924
<v Speaker 2>has discovery are aspects that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>encounters in the external world that </v>

1200
01:06:07.571 --> 01:06:08.404
<v Speaker 2>are actually also characteristic of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a consequence of being immersed </v>

1201
01:06:12.581 --> 01:06:13.414
<v Speaker 2>in society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sees that it is possible for people </v>

1202
01:06:15.491 --> 01:06:18.340
<v Speaker 2>to die knowing that he is in fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

1203
01:06:18.490 --> 01:06:19.323
<v Speaker 2>The inference is pretty easy to draw </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that changes the structure of the </v>

1204
01:06:22.391 --> 01:06:23.350
<v Speaker 2>world substantially.</v>

1205
01:06:23.350 --> 01:06:26.170
<v Speaker 2>So now he knows that he get died and now</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can become sick.</v>

1206
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:28.690
<v Speaker 2>So back to back to the castle once </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

1207
01:06:30.130 --> 01:06:30.881
<v Speaker 2>This time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>

1208
01:06:30.881 --> 01:06:31.714
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't work so well because he's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>so happy with the things that used to </v>

1209
01:06:33.581 --> 01:06:36.550
<v Speaker 2>make him happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he goes out a third time.</v>

1210
01:06:37.210 --> 01:06:38.160
<v Speaker 2>This time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the godsend.</v>

1211
01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:40.150
<v Speaker 2>Send a dead man in the funeral </v>
<v Speaker 2>procession.</v>

1212
01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:42.783
<v Speaker 2>This creature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he asked his attendant laying so still </v>

1213
01:06:44.111 --> 01:06:46.890
<v Speaker 2>appearing so fierce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm surrounded by grief and sorrow lost.</v>

1214
01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:49.630
<v Speaker 2>And for Lauren,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the intended answer?</v>

1215
01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:52.660
<v Speaker 2>That's a man like other men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>born of woman I loved and hated.</v>

1216
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:56.940
<v Speaker 2>Who once was unl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there like other men you say inquired</v>

1217
01:06:56.941 --> 01:06:59.440
<v Speaker 2>the prints,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then this could happen to me.</v>

1218
01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:02.350
<v Speaker 2>This is your ends and the attendant and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the end of all,</v>

1219
01:07:02.351 --> 01:07:03.184
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world collapsed the final time and </v>

1220
01:07:05.191 --> 01:07:06.820
<v Speaker 2>get time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I asked to be returned home,</v>

1221
01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:10.540
<v Speaker 2>but the attendant had orders from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>princess father and took them instead to</v>

1222
01:07:10.541 --> 01:07:13.540
<v Speaker 2>a festival of women who concurring </v>
<v Speaker 2>nearby and Grove in the woods.</v>

1223
01:07:14.170 --> 01:07:15.003
<v Speaker 2>Prince was met by beautiful assemblage </v>
<v Speaker 2>who offered themselves freely to him </v>

1224
01:07:18.461 --> 01:07:19.294
<v Speaker 2>without restraints,</v>
<v Speaker 2>song and dancing play in the spirit of </v>

1225
01:07:21.941 --> 01:07:22.774
<v Speaker 2>central love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good time I could think of when we have </v>

1226
01:07:24.461 --> 01:07:25.294
<v Speaker 2>death and the inevitable decomposition </v>
<v Speaker 2>of beauty to feel pleasure in the </v>

1227
01:07:28.061 --> 01:07:30.400
<v Speaker 2>display.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for him,</v>

1228
01:07:30.730 --> 01:07:34.840
<v Speaker 2>the consequences of the emergence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>self consciousness for the contamination</v>

1229
01:07:34.841 --> 01:07:37.180
<v Speaker 2>of all good things with the possibility </v>
<v Speaker 2>of death.</v>

1230
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:38.343
<v Speaker 2>That's a funny story because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>descent from paradise right when he </v>

1231
01:07:41.111 --> 01:07:44.620
<v Speaker 2>falls out of the protected city and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a catastrophe.</v>

1232
01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:49.630
<v Speaker 2>But it's also a precondition to his </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventual regeneration as the Buddha.</v>

1233
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:50.583
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that story is the story that we've been </v>

1234
01:07:52.271 --> 01:07:55.120
<v Speaker 2>talking about over and over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is</v>

1235
01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:57.633
<v Speaker 2>this story.</v>

1236
01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:14.190
<v Speaker 2>So this is the wall of the city</v>
<v Speaker 2>and outside of the walled city,</v>

1237
01:08:14.691 --> 01:08:15.524
<v Speaker 2>and there's but chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if a piece of the Nautilus </v>

1238
01:08:20.361 --> 01:08:25.160
<v Speaker 2>information</v>
<v Speaker 2>knocks down your structure,</v>

1239
01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:28.100
<v Speaker 2>then you end up in a place that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>defined by chaos,</v>

1240
01:08:28.101 --> 01:08:32.150
<v Speaker 2>which of course appears to be a complete</v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe to you because your emotions</v>

1241
01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:35.510
<v Speaker 2>are dysregulated and there's nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>left but anxiety and depression.</v>

1242
01:08:35.690 --> 01:08:38.000
<v Speaker 2>But it's also the case that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>descent,</v>

1243
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:40.580
<v Speaker 2>which in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in these stories,</v>

1244
01:08:40.610 --> 01:08:42.110
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's absolutely inevitable.</v>

1245
01:08:42.111 --> 01:08:42.944
<v Speaker 2>This is so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very interesting because the </v>

1246
01:08:43.611 --> 01:08:46.070
<v Speaker 2>concept of original sin isn't explicit </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Buddhism,</v>

1247
01:08:46.071 --> 01:08:46.904
<v Speaker 2>but it's very much explicit in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>story because the reason that Buddha </v>

1248
01:08:49.911 --> 01:08:52.430
<v Speaker 2>goes outside of the walls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's curious like,</v>

1249
01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:53.780
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's happy.</v>

1250
01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:55.850
<v Speaker 2>Everything's going real well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you might think,</v>

1251
01:08:55.851 --> 01:08:56.271
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1252
01:08:56.271 --> 01:08:57.104
<v Speaker 2>why spoil a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the point is he does for the good </v>

1253
01:08:58.641 --> 01:09:00.440
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's not good enough.</v>

1254
01:09:00.770 --> 01:09:02.850
<v Speaker 2>What's outside the wall?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

1255
01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:05.390
<v Speaker 2>And so it goes and looks and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences are,</v>

1256
01:09:05.490 --> 01:09:07.220
<v Speaker 2>it's like that's the end of the paradise</v>
<v Speaker 2>foy.</v>

1257
01:09:07.221 --> 01:09:08.460
<v Speaker 2>And you're not going to get back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

1258
01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:10.280
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to go back to the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>place to get it.</v>

1259
01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:11.660
<v Speaker 2>It's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1260
01:09:11.661 --> 01:09:13.850
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly the same idea as original</v>

1261
01:09:13.851 --> 01:09:17.240
<v Speaker 2>sin in Christianity as Adam's Adam and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Eve's sin,</v>

1262
01:09:17.241 --> 01:09:18.074
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They take the apple as the forbidden </v>

1263
01:09:19.491 --> 01:09:21.920
<v Speaker 2>thing that makes themselves conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes them,</v>

1264
01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:26.110
<v Speaker 2>makes them aware of their own death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes them aware of their own nakedness,</v>

1265
01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:29.750
<v Speaker 2>makes it necessary for them to work and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tosses the amount of paradise,</v>

1266
01:09:30.130 --> 01:09:31.460
<v Speaker 2>curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>original suit,</v>

1267
01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.550
<v Speaker 2>miscarriage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

1268
01:09:33.551 --> 01:09:34.201
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while,</v>

1269
01:09:34.201 --> 01:09:35.990
<v Speaker 2>and it's a funny thing because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>also,</v>

1270
01:09:36.890 --> 01:09:38.870
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also the auto fill.</v>

1271
01:09:38.910 --> 01:09:40.730
<v Speaker 2>That's an original sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

1272
01:09:40.731 --> 01:09:42.320
<v Speaker 2>the precondition for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1273
01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:47.180
<v Speaker 2>for the whole redemptive story because </v>
<v Speaker 2>although this was paradise,</v>

1274
01:09:47.181 --> 01:09:52.181
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this place is on a higher order of being</v>

1275
01:09:53.061 --> 01:09:54.960
<v Speaker 2>than this place was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess at that.</v>

1276
01:09:54.970 --> 01:09:55.803
<v Speaker 2>I think that's because here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the paradise that precedes the original </v>

1277
01:09:59.571 --> 01:10:02.090
<v Speaker 2>descendants characterized by complete </v>
<v Speaker 2>lack of consciousness.</v>

1278
01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:03.163
<v Speaker 2>There's no consciousness there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the paradise that re emerges as a </v>

1279
01:10:06.711 --> 01:10:07.544
<v Speaker 2>consequence of this whole story is one </v>
<v Speaker 2>in which self consciousness exists and </v>

1280
01:10:11.061 --> 01:10:13.010
<v Speaker 2>his whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

1281
01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:19.120
<v Speaker 2>well I think personally I think that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>partly because here's one reason</v>

1282
01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:24.163
<v Speaker 2>in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this pretty conscious paradise is </v>

1283
01:10:26.481 --> 01:10:28.910
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's paradise because it's nothing,</v>

1284
01:10:29.150 --> 01:10:31.970
<v Speaker 2>which means there's no suffering there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's nothing else either.</v>

1285
01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:35.390
<v Speaker 2>And here at least there's actually the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

1286
01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:37.010
<v Speaker 2>but it's the war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there is a world,</v>

1287
01:10:37.011 --> 01:10:40.130
<v Speaker 2>there's the possibility for suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also represents a sort of mode of</v>

1288
01:10:40.131 --> 01:10:45.131
<v Speaker 2>being where there can be a world and </v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously people can live in it.</v>

1289
01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:47.183
<v Speaker 2>It's just the question that gets that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's always trying to figure out </v>

1290
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:50.833
<v Speaker 2>how is it that there can be a world and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it can be tolerable at the same </v>

1291
01:10:53.151 --> 01:10:53.984
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1292
01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:55.333
<v Speaker 2>So because isn't it also that story </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's simply what those </v>

1293
01:10:58.491 --> 01:10:59.610
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>

1294
01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:02.090
<v Speaker 2>It's an explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1295
01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:03.733
<v Speaker 2>I mean how did we get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't be were originally simply by </v>

1296
01:11:05.421 --> 01:11:06.930
<v Speaker 2>watching what does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1297
01:11:07.490 --> 01:11:08.323
<v Speaker 2>Well the other thing about this story </v>
<v Speaker 2>too is that it's the story of </v>

1298
01:11:10.011 --> 01:11:12.890
<v Speaker 2>maturation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can think of it as it's,</v>

1299
01:11:12.891 --> 01:11:16.320
<v Speaker 2>it is theoretically a description of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened at the dawn of time,</v>

1300
01:11:16.321 --> 01:11:17.154
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in a sense that's accurate in a </v>

1301
01:11:18.811 --> 01:11:19.644
<v Speaker 2>sense because there wasn't time back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows how long ago when we weren't </v>

1302
01:11:24.181 --> 01:11:25.014
<v Speaker 2>self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is something that's emerged as </v>

1303
01:11:26.911 --> 01:11:28.280
<v Speaker 2>a consequence of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of you know,</v>

1304
01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:29.123
<v Speaker 2>who knows what processes and it seemed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to emerge very quickly if you assume </v>

1305
01:11:32.411 --> 01:11:33.244
<v Speaker 2>that the development of self </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness is related in some way to </v>

1306
01:11:35.311 --> 01:11:36.144
<v Speaker 2>the expansion of the Cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which seems to be pretty reasonable </v>

1307
01:11:38.011 --> 01:11:38.844
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis.</v>

1308
01:11:38.970 --> 01:11:43.970
<v Speaker 2>The human cortex expanded unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly from the evolutionary viewpoint.</v>

1309
01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:48.480
<v Speaker 2>So our development of self consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that historical event.</v>

1310
01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:49.733
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say the business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an accurate description of historical </v>

1311
01:11:52.081 --> 01:11:54.180
<v Speaker 2>event is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not really trying to be that.</v>

1312
01:11:54.181 --> 01:11:57.690
<v Speaker 2>It's trying to describe the meaning of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>series of processes,</v>

1313
01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:01.230
<v Speaker 2>but more importantly also it's a story </v>
<v Speaker 2>of what necessarily,</v>

1314
01:12:01.231 --> 01:12:03.750
<v Speaker 2>how it was when you mature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the thing,</v>

1315
01:12:03.810 --> 01:12:04.521
<v Speaker 2>like when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1316
01:12:04.521 --> 01:12:06.510
<v Speaker 2>you're say you're very young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two years old,</v>

1317
01:12:06.511 --> 01:12:09.750
<v Speaker 2>your mother does protect you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is literally the case that she</v>

1318
01:12:09.751 --> 01:12:12.510
<v Speaker 2>shields you from your vulnerability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's right here.</v>

1319
01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:13.653
<v Speaker 2>You have a screwdriver and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>heading towards the electrical outlet </v>

1320
01:12:15.341 --> 01:12:16.290
<v Speaker 2>and your mother says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1321
01:12:16.291 --> 01:12:17.730
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know there's a wall,</v>

1322
01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:18.593
<v Speaker 2>there's a wall there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She tries to make sure that you don't </v>

1323
01:12:20.281 --> 01:12:23.640
<v Speaker 2>fall down the stairs or at least that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're soft if you do and the old stick</v>

1324
01:12:23.641 --> 01:12:25.320
<v Speaker 2>your hand on the oven and so on and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth.</v>

1325
01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:26.153
<v Speaker 2>She's always there as an intermediary </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a form of paradise and you </v>

1326
01:12:29.041 --> 01:12:29.401
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1327
01:12:29.401 --> 01:12:32.970
<v Speaker 2>what drives you beyond that paradise </v>
<v Speaker 2>lost your curiosity.</v>

1328
01:12:33.930 --> 01:12:35.790
<v Speaker 2>As you mature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get,</v>

1329
01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:39.630
<v Speaker 2>you develop a larger and larger </v>
<v Speaker 2>repertoire of behaviors,</v>

1330
01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:43.680
<v Speaker 2>more and more interest in what's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on and outside world who finally you get</v>

1331
01:12:43.681 --> 01:12:48.450
<v Speaker 2>to the point where the things you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of your own curiosity because of</v>

1332
01:12:48.451 --> 01:12:52.530
<v Speaker 2>your own exploratory activity are so </v>
<v Speaker 2>complex that your mother and father,</v>

1333
01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:55.470
<v Speaker 2>they can't protect you anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're outside the walls.</v>

1334
01:12:55.650 --> 01:12:57.450
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you try to go back,</v>

1335
01:12:57.451 --> 01:12:58.800
<v Speaker 2>it just means you're sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>

1336
01:12:58.801 --> 01:13:00.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1337
01:13:00.181 --> 01:13:02.490
<v Speaker 2>it's really going to solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll just make things worse.</v>

1338
01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:06.330
<v Speaker 2>So this is this story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a mythological story is a story</v>

1339
01:13:06.331 --> 01:13:08.260
<v Speaker 2>that characterizes everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1340
01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:10.110
<v Speaker 2>that's why you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not such a very,</v>

1341
01:13:10.170 --> 01:13:11.003
<v Speaker 2>not very logical idea too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make light of a notion like original </v>

1342
01:13:13.651 --> 01:13:14.250
<v Speaker 2>sin.</v>

1343
01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:17.310
<v Speaker 2>So you figure out what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it a heritable</v>

1344
01:13:18.810 --> 01:13:21.060
<v Speaker 2>heritable characteristics kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>humanity.</v>

1345
01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:23.550
<v Speaker 2>It's fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>far as I can tell,</v>

1346
01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:27.870
<v Speaker 2>especially if you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences once you're self conscious,</v>

1347
01:13:28.170 --> 01:13:29.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very easy to view the world.</v>

1348
01:13:29.851 --> 01:13:31.600
<v Speaker 2>There's an unfair place and we can look </v>
<v Speaker 2>at it.</v>

1349
01:13:31.610 --> 01:13:33.600
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a pretty ain't fair place </v>
<v Speaker 2>and think about it.</v>

1350
01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:34.673
<v Speaker 2>And it is the case that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your tooling along doing just fine and </v>

1351
01:13:37.321 --> 01:13:38.950
<v Speaker 2>acting appropriately as far as your </v>
<v Speaker 2>concern.</v>

1352
01:13:38.951 --> 01:13:42.150
<v Speaker 2>And it's like one day bang of cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something equally horrible.</v>

1353
01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:44.340
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem to be any justice in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that at all.</v>

1354
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:47.820
<v Speaker 2>It's not very difficult to turn an </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal into something that's aggressive.</v>

1355
01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:49.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to do is punish it.</v>

1356
01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:53.790
<v Speaker 2>Unpredictable and unjustly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

1357
01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:54.973
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means that the animal can't figure </v>

1358
01:13:55.831 --> 01:13:59.340
<v Speaker 2>out how to avoid the punishment and also</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the punishment,</v>

1359
01:13:59.430 --> 01:14:00.990
<v Speaker 2>well that's the primary aspect of it.</v>

1360
01:14:00.990 --> 01:14:03.180
<v Speaker 2>As far as the animals concern and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>in that position all the time.</v>

1361
01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:04.890
<v Speaker 2>It's like terrible things happened to </v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

1362
01:14:05.050 --> 01:14:05.883
<v Speaker 2>That seems completely independent of our</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular behavioral patterns and </v>

1363
01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:11.350
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things that turns </v>
<v Speaker 2>people against the world.</v>

1364
01:14:12.330 --> 01:14:16.970
<v Speaker 2>But that's what makes me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1365
01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:17.973
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's in fact in an earlier version of </v>

1366
01:14:20.591 --> 01:14:21.424
<v Speaker 2>this manuscript,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this chapter I had a sexual and </v>

1367
01:14:23.291 --> 01:14:27.490
<v Speaker 2>learned helplessness because it is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>case that if you punish an animal and it</v>

1368
01:14:27.491 --> 01:14:29.330
<v Speaker 2>can escape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what happens to them</v>

1369
01:14:30.850 --> 01:14:31.683
<v Speaker 2>also get aggressive?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well Gretchen is one of the things that </v>

1370
01:14:34.331 --> 01:14:36.670
<v Speaker 2>might happen along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I handle the circumstances.</v>

1371
01:14:36.671 --> 01:14:39.160
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you take an animal and you shock</v>

1372
01:14:39.161 --> 01:14:40.330
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in a cage.</v>

1373
01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:43.990
<v Speaker 2>Well it Kevin you get aggressive cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing to get aggressive about.</v>

1374
01:14:44.350 --> 01:14:45.810
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like let's say you take out,</v>

1375
01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:48.370
<v Speaker 2>take a wrap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nelson,</v>

1376
01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:51.790
<v Speaker 2>his cage and any shocked the wrath </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed him ups.</v>

1377
01:14:52.330 --> 01:14:53.163
<v Speaker 2>So to some degree the effects of </v>
<v Speaker 2>punishment or a situation dependent and </v>

1378
01:14:56.291 --> 01:14:57.124
<v Speaker 2>punishment does do two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an unconditioned stimuli for </v>

1379
01:14:59.471 --> 01:15:03.850
<v Speaker 2>aggression and it's also conditioned </v>
<v Speaker 2>stimuli for for extinction of behavior,</v>

1380
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.220
<v Speaker 2>which she has learned helplessness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's these two pathways to,</v>

1381
01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:09.940
<v Speaker 2>and it's almost the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you</v>

1382
01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:13.810
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a thought experiment.</v>

1383
01:15:14.050 --> 01:15:16.030
<v Speaker 2>There's a cat here and you chase around </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a stick.</v>

1384
01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:19.130
<v Speaker 2>Any corner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any neck if you're an you poke it with a</v>

1385
01:15:19.131 --> 01:15:21.160
<v Speaker 2>stick was going to hiss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hiss and fight.</v>

1386
01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:22.173
<v Speaker 2>But if you keep doing it sooner or later</v>
<v Speaker 2>the aggressive response has been </v>

1387
01:15:24.151 --> 01:15:28.570
<v Speaker 2>extinguished and it'll just pass bath is</v>
<v Speaker 2>to lay there and take the punishment.</v>

1388
01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:31.230
<v Speaker 2>That a thing of the thing that's funny </v>
<v Speaker 2>about your example,</v>

1389
01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:33.970
<v Speaker 2>we are in that situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

1390
01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:35.373
<v Speaker 2>the learn like our conditions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence are very much and now it gets </v>

1391
01:15:38.651 --> 01:15:39.484
<v Speaker 2>to those experiments that psychologists </v>
<v Speaker 2>and conduct that produced learned </v>

1392
01:15:41.771 --> 01:15:42.604
<v Speaker 2>helplessness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are close to at least some subjected </v>

1393
01:15:45.191 --> 01:15:48.160
<v Speaker 2>to um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unpredictable.</v>

1394
01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:52.920
<v Speaker 2>Our problem is we have to learn how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with it nonetheless.</v>

1395
01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:54.953
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of what we're trying to just </v>

1396
01:15:55.770 --> 01:15:59.290
<v Speaker 2>discover in these messages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a possible way of doing that?</v>

1397
01:15:59.710 --> 01:16:02.440
<v Speaker 2>Also while admitting to the fact that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the case,</v>

1398
01:16:02.890 --> 01:16:04.870
<v Speaker 2>because one way of doing it is just to </v>
<v Speaker 2>deny it,</v>

1399
01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:10.930
<v Speaker 2>deny the fact that terrible things out </v>
<v Speaker 2>fafsa and the recent social psychology,</v>

1400
01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:11.823
<v Speaker 2>psychological literature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole body of studies that </v>

1401
01:16:14.021 --> 01:16:15.580
<v Speaker 2>suggest that that's the best way to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1402
01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:17.190
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has themself allusions.</v>

1403
01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:19.033
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's only all these things that </v>

1404
01:16:21.831 --> 01:16:22.664
<v Speaker 2>happened to one or only</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thinks that there's some reason </v>

1405
01:16:26.741 --> 01:16:31.550
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it wasn't there.</v>

1406
01:16:31.551 --> 01:16:32.384
<v Speaker 2>I missed the trend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a punishment because it's a </v>

1407
01:16:34.371 --> 01:16:37.010
<v Speaker 2>negative experience or it just happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I missed the train?</v>

1408
01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:39.530
<v Speaker 2>It's not anything can do well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

1409
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:43.870
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1410
01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:45.413
<v Speaker 2>I see what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the inference that we generally </v>

1411
01:16:47.471 --> 01:16:50.410
<v Speaker 2>drive that regardless of whether there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a will behind it,</v>

1412
01:16:50.590 --> 01:16:53.800
<v Speaker 2>it's arbitrary and unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the training things slightly,</v>

1413
01:16:53.801 --> 01:16:55.830
<v Speaker 2>it's me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too minimal to make a case out.</v>

1414
01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:58.390
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone close to you and develops,</v>

1415
01:16:58.480 --> 01:16:59.313
<v Speaker 2>like say someone that's close to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's also universally recognized as </v>

1416
01:17:02.501 --> 01:17:03.334
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>develop some absolutely atrocious </v>

1417
01:17:05.201 --> 01:17:06.034
<v Speaker 2>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which happens with a fair amount of </v>

1418
01:17:07.331 --> 01:17:08.164
<v Speaker 2>frequent frequency under conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult not to draw the </v>

1419
01:17:11.361 --> 01:17:15.530
<v Speaker 2>inference that despite the lack of will </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind the disease,</v>

1420
01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:19.400
<v Speaker 2>it's evident that the world as it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>constituted is a very unfair place.</v>

1421
01:17:20.370 --> 01:17:21.203
<v Speaker 2>It because it certainly those sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things would run contrary to all our </v>

1422
01:17:23.481 --> 01:17:25.190
<v Speaker 2>notions of what constitutes fair.</v>

1423
01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:27.810
<v Speaker 1>Do you have an expectation that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world is at their place?</v>

1424
01:17:27.811 --> 01:17:31.370
<v Speaker 1>That's how you define it as unfair or do</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think that,</v>

1425
01:17:32.830 --> 01:17:35.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me,</v>

1426
01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:37.900
<v Speaker 1>nevermind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1427
01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:38.753
<v Speaker 1>that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

1428
01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to me that</v>

1429
01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:45.593
<v Speaker 1>until the current age where everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly well accepts the whole idea of </v>

1430
01:17:50.131 --> 01:17:51.460
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1431
01:17:52.150 --> 01:17:52.983
<v Speaker 1>When there's no real reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no meaning for us to be the </v>

1432
01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:56.353
<v Speaker 1>types of creatures that we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just sort of happened before that I </v>

1433
01:18:00.271 --> 01:18:01.104
<v Speaker 1>think philosophers strove very hard to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find the meaning to explore why it was </v>

1434
01:18:04.381 --> 01:18:05.214
<v Speaker 1>the way it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1435
01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:07.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1436
01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:10.510
<v Speaker 1>in that sense that there was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectation that the,</v>

1437
01:18:10.630 --> 01:18:12.900
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world should be just right.</v>

1438
01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:14.790
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason for it not to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless,</v>

1439
01:18:14.850 --> 01:18:16.350
<v Speaker 1>unless there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's not just,</v>

1440
01:18:16.351 --> 01:18:19.760
<v Speaker 1>there must be a reason it was worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>uninsured now that,</v>

1441
01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:24.230
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I would say that I see the logic</v>

1442
01:18:24.231 --> 01:18:26.930
<v Speaker 2>in your argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess what I'm trying to figure out is</v>

1443
01:18:26.931 --> 01:18:27.764
<v Speaker 2>that you like is it possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it possible for us to exist in any </v>

1444
01:18:31.581 --> 01:18:32.414
<v Speaker 2>sane manner?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which I would say saying being in part </v>

1445
01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:36.993
<v Speaker 2>not in adopting authoritarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>identification with groups and civil </v>

1446
01:18:40.311 --> 01:18:41.144
<v Speaker 2>tediously pa be able to accurately after</v>
<v Speaker 2>him the fact that the fundamental </v>

1447
01:18:45.021 --> 01:18:47.630
<v Speaker 2>structure of the world is falling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neither fair nor I'm fair,</v>

1448
01:18:47.631 --> 01:18:50.030
<v Speaker 2>but at least it appears to us under many</v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances.</v>

1449
01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:53.570
<v Speaker 2>It's very unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer that seems to be no,</v>

1450
01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:54.433
<v Speaker 2>I think all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that people who are faced with that </v>

1451
01:18:56.961 --> 01:18:57.794
<v Speaker 2>sort of choice frequently take a route </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the problem that actually makes </v>

1452
01:19:02.091 --> 01:19:04.340
<v Speaker 2>it worse over time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

1453
01:19:04.341 --> 01:19:05.350
<v Speaker 2>they'll adopt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1454
01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:06.263
<v Speaker 2>in an authoritarian stance as a means of</v>
<v Speaker 2>protecting themselves against types of </v>

1455
01:19:09.801 --> 01:19:10.370
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

1456
01:19:10.370 --> 01:19:11.203
<v Speaker 2>They kept tolerant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I guess part of what I'm trying to </v>

1457
01:19:13.701 --> 01:19:16.630
<v Speaker 2>find out is there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a story that makes sense out of</v>

1458
01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:20.230
<v Speaker 2>things that we necessarily perceive as </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfair one?</v>

1459
01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:24.650
<v Speaker 2>And that's kind of one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll try to discuss it over the rest of</v>

1460
01:19:24.651 --> 01:19:28.100
<v Speaker 2>the course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm just saying what are like I want,</v>

1461
01:19:28.101 --> 01:19:31.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to do today is line some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the consequences of did this.</v>

1462
01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:32.653
<v Speaker 2>I think people do have a implicit idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the world is fair because the part </v>

1463
01:19:37.730 --> 01:19:39.830
<v Speaker 2>they're given that when they're brought </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

1464
01:19:39.831 --> 01:19:40.664
<v Speaker 2>when their kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things he tried to do </v>

1465
01:19:42.951 --> 01:19:44.380
<v Speaker 2>with the child's environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

1466
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:45.223
<v Speaker 2>do you make sure the rewards and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>punishments are distributed in an </v>

1467
01:19:47.361 --> 01:19:48.194
<v Speaker 2>equitable and predictable manner and not</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards the twos justice in large part </v>

1468
01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:54.980
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things the child </v>
<v Speaker 2>discovers and it's necessary to do that.</v>

1469
01:19:54.981 --> 01:19:55.814
<v Speaker 2>The child would just completely like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll be in developed by chaos and </v>

1470
01:20:00.621 --> 01:20:03.410
<v Speaker 2>terrible things will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's necessary to do that.</v>

1471
01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:04.573
<v Speaker 2>But if you do do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then when the child goes out into the </v>

1472
01:20:06.711 --> 01:20:08.090
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he will discover,</v>

1473
01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:08.973
<v Speaker 1>she will discover in short order that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are all sorts of things that have </v>

1474
01:20:11.970 --> 01:20:15.740
<v Speaker 1>that don't fit into that framework even </v>
<v Speaker 1>though the framework that has this.</v>

1475
01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:20.400
<v Speaker 1>So I would say that that is our natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>response is like this is unfair.</v>

1476
01:20:20.670 --> 01:20:21.503
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's part of the reason why </v>

1477
01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:23.573
<v Speaker 1>tragic things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially those things that appear </v>

1478
01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:30.480
<v Speaker 1>possibly unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like say someone that say something that</v>

1479
01:20:30.481 --> 01:20:32.470
<v Speaker 1>you're very close to is brutally </v>
<v Speaker 1>murdered,</v>

1480
01:20:32.471 --> 01:20:33.304
<v Speaker 1>sort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of on a whim by something halfway </v>

1481
01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:35.353
<v Speaker 1>did psychopath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the sort of thing that's </v>

1482
01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:40.590
<v Speaker 1>not only seems incredibly tragic but </v>
<v Speaker 1>also completely pointless.</v>

1483
01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:41.753
<v Speaker 1>It is those sorts of things that really </v>
<v Speaker 1>undermine our ability to believe that </v>

1484
01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:46.320
<v Speaker 1>our existence is have any meaning at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

1485
01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:51.640
<v Speaker 1>And then distance is predictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not people in their hands very close</v>

1486
01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:54.510
<v Speaker 1>to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>develops cancer.</v>

1487
01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:59.340
<v Speaker 1>Saying the attribution could be that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is unfair,</v>

1488
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.430
<v Speaker 1>but what you're really saying is that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was unpredictable.</v>

1489
01:21:02.431 --> 01:21:03.264
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's one aspect that would be </v>

1490
01:21:05.521 --> 01:21:07.590
<v Speaker 1>unfair attribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unpredictable.</v>

1491
01:21:07.591 --> 01:21:10.240
<v Speaker 1>Plus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's also an unjust judge.</v>

1492
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1493
01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:14.030
<v Speaker 2>But if you're just not intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>

1494
01:21:14.031 --> 01:21:15.540
<v Speaker 2>you don't add that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not true.</v>

1495
01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:17.310
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have.</v>

1496
01:21:17.311 --> 01:21:20.010
<v Speaker 2>The fact that it's adjustable because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know if you do,</v>

1497
01:21:20.011 --> 01:21:23.640
<v Speaker 2>like what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might say it's not logical to do so,</v>

1498
01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:26.160
<v Speaker 2>but I would say that if it happens to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you you will do it.</v>

1499
01:21:26.161 --> 01:21:26.971
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with it.</v>

1500
01:21:26.971 --> 01:21:28.720
<v Speaker 2>That is generally the way we work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that,</v>

1501
01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:31.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's across the board </v>
<v Speaker 2>the case.</v>

1502
01:21:31.501 --> 01:21:32.221
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1503
01:21:32.221 --> 01:21:34.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't see why you couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why you can't get beyond that.</v>

1504
01:21:35.130 --> 01:21:35.963
<v Speaker 2>What I really wanted to say that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that you said about when you </v>

1505
01:21:37.381 --> 01:21:41.640
<v Speaker 2>were saying that children that you teach</v>
<v Speaker 2>children that the world is fair,</v>

1506
01:21:42.630 --> 01:21:43.463
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to me that that's often not</v>
<v Speaker 2>the case because I think chil children </v>

1507
01:21:47.250 --> 01:21:50.640
<v Speaker 2>often use that as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as their complaint.</v>

1508
01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:51.510
<v Speaker 2>That's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1509
01:21:51.570 --> 01:21:52.403
<v Speaker 2>is not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that I've always </v>

1510
01:21:54.841 --> 01:21:57.210
<v Speaker 2>heard parents say to kids as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well life isn't fair.</v>

1511
01:21:57.220 --> 01:22:02.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of you say that to a child,</v>

1512
01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:04.140
<v Speaker 2>you're not actually communicating any </v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

1513
01:22:04.410 --> 01:22:05.243
<v Speaker 2>You'll just rationalizing the present </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation because of the truth of the </v>

1514
01:22:07.591 --> 01:22:08.424
<v Speaker 2>matter is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that if you set up a stable </v>

1515
01:22:09.331 --> 01:22:11.850
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything you've done has led the child</v>

1516
01:22:11.851 --> 01:22:13.770
<v Speaker 2>to believe that in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world is fair,</v>

1517
01:22:13.771 --> 01:22:16.530
<v Speaker 2>which means it is predictable and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1518
01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:19.680
<v Speaker 2>but I do think that maybe you're just </v>
<v Speaker 2>exposing them to that you're exposing it</v>

1519
01:22:19.681 --> 01:22:21.450
<v Speaker 2>to them slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the small thing,</v>

1520
01:22:21.451 --> 01:22:22.540
<v Speaker 2>like you can't have the ice cream </v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

1521
01:22:22.630 --> 01:22:23.463
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think that's what you're doing </v>

1522
01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:26.850
<v Speaker 2>eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they will learn that life.</v>

1523
01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:29.310
<v Speaker 2>Why shouldn't they learn eventually that</v>
<v Speaker 2>life isn't fair?</v>

1524
01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:32.400
<v Speaker 2>But the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once they learned that life isn't fair,</v>

1525
01:22:32.401 --> 01:22:33.450
<v Speaker 2>what do they do?</v>

1526
01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:36.810
<v Speaker 2>Let's this fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see the unabomber for an example,</v>

1527
01:22:36.811 --> 01:22:38.610
<v Speaker 2>because I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what I think.</v>

1528
01:22:38.611 --> 01:22:39.444
<v Speaker 2>I know what he's like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's someone who thinks that the world </v>

1529
01:22:42.810 --> 01:22:43.643
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally is an unfair place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it's his moral obligation to </v>

1530
01:22:46.831 --> 01:22:47.664
<v Speaker 2>take revenge against it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he's picked certain aspects of the </v>

1531
01:22:50.311 --> 01:22:52.680
<v Speaker 2>world to take revenge against.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But his,</v>

1532
01:22:52.810 --> 01:22:53.643
<v Speaker 2>like in his self consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he construes himself not only as a </v>

1533
01:22:56.251 --> 01:22:57.084
<v Speaker 2>victim of unfair then just forced us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as the kind of victim and who has </v>

1534
01:23:00.901 --> 01:23:01.734
<v Speaker 2>the right to cast judgment on is </v>
<v Speaker 2>victimization and to take action in a </v>

1535
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:07.330
<v Speaker 2>vengeful action essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So look,</v>

1536
01:23:07.331 --> 01:23:09.370
<v Speaker 2>where does he live in a cabin in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Montana?</v>

1537
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:10.690
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1538
01:23:10.691 --> 01:23:11.524
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so that he won't get contaminated </v>

1539
01:23:13.151 --> 01:23:15.790
<v Speaker 2>by the rest of the human race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

1540
01:23:15.791 --> 01:23:16.624
<v Speaker 2>So he might've been rejected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's sitting there thinking like in </v>

1541
01:23:19.511 --> 01:23:23.920
<v Speaker 2>the back of his dark and stormy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>little brain that that,</v>

1542
01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:30.240
<v Speaker 2>that half</v>
<v Speaker 2>the human race is fundamentally evil and</v>

1543
01:23:30.911 --> 01:23:34.000
<v Speaker 2>the only appropriate thing to do is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>detach yourself from it.</v>

1544
01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:36.530
<v Speaker 2>And there's also an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tremendous amount of volume,</v>

1545
01:23:36.531 --> 01:23:39.400
<v Speaker 2>the scn posturing and arrogance at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>back of that,</v>

1546
01:23:39.401 --> 01:23:43.360
<v Speaker 2>which is why he could spend all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>time constructing bombs and sending them</v>

1547
01:23:43.361 --> 01:23:44.194
<v Speaker 2>off to more or less random targets that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he inappropriately identifies with the </v>

1548
01:23:49.181 --> 01:23:51.910
<v Speaker 2>natural methological categories that </v>
<v Speaker 2>make up this thinking.</v>

1549
01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:53.780
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's mad at university.</v>

1550
01:23:53.781 --> 01:23:56.030
<v Speaker 2>So we bombs individual professors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1551
01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:56.864
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1552
01:23:57.340 --> 01:24:00.190
<v Speaker 2>this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not inappropriate.</v>

1553
01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:01.623
<v Speaker 2>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you construe the world he has an </v>

1554
01:24:04.931 --> 01:24:07.210
<v Speaker 2>unfair place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did you do?</v>

1555
01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:08.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say one of their,</v>

1556
01:24:08.891 --> 01:24:11.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean we can either change your action </v>
<v Speaker 2>or you can change your thinking.</v>

1557
01:24:12.030 --> 01:24:14.020
<v Speaker 2>Have an alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1558
01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:16.120
<v Speaker 2>but you need an alternative that you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe.</v>

1559
01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:18.400
<v Speaker 2>You can't just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't just say,</v>

1560
01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:19.960
<v Speaker 2>hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a problem.</v>

1561
01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:20.853
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1562
01:24:21.850 --> 01:24:24.310
<v Speaker 2>the problems that self consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>pose,</v>

1563
01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:25.720
<v Speaker 2>it's an emergent problem.</v>

1564
01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:28.840
<v Speaker 2>Let's say it's only a problem that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>been around for a million years.</v>

1565
01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:31.690
<v Speaker 2>It's nobody's figured out what to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>about like,</v>

1566
01:24:31.691 --> 01:24:34.240
<v Speaker 2>because as soon as you become self </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious,</v>

1567
01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:37.480
<v Speaker 2>it appears that the world is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitrary and unfair place.</v>

1568
01:24:37.890 --> 01:24:38.723
<v Speaker 2>Then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the world is an arbitrary and unfair </v>

1569
01:24:41.231 --> 01:24:43.330
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how should you respond to them?</v>

1570
01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:48.100
<v Speaker 2>Now an animal subjected to evidence that</v>
<v Speaker 2>suggests that the world is arbitrary and</v>

1571
01:24:48.101 --> 01:24:50.290
<v Speaker 2>unfair develops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learned helplessness,</v>

1572
01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:51.473
<v Speaker 2>just depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now lots of people develop that like </v>

1573
01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:57.250
<v Speaker 2>they quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was because why bother?</v>

1574
01:24:57.460 --> 01:25:01.600
<v Speaker 2>Which is a really potent argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why bother if such and such is likely to</v>

1575
01:25:01.601 --> 01:25:03.430
<v Speaker 2>happen to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which it undoubtedly is.</v>

1576
01:25:03.670 --> 01:25:04.990
<v Speaker 2>Why do anything?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1577
01:25:04.991 --> 01:25:05.824
<v Speaker 2>that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lots of people don't accept that our to </v>

1578
01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:09.880
<v Speaker 2>because they never think about it or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1579
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.640
<v Speaker 2>For whatever reasons they're protected </v>
<v Speaker 2>from that line of logic.</v>

1580
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.370
<v Speaker 2>But another line of logic is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1581
01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:17.560
<v Speaker 2>let's take some revenge against the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1582
01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:19.913
<v Speaker 2>That's a potent line of logic as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Group girth that for goods and for </v>

1583
01:25:22.331 --> 01:25:23.164
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

1584
01:25:23.290 --> 01:25:24.123
<v Speaker 2>his notion of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the fundamental philosophy of </v>

1585
01:25:29.681 --> 01:25:31.720
<v Speaker 2>Mephistopheles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the,</v>

1586
01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:33.593
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literary incarnation of the negative </v>

1587
01:25:34.841 --> 01:25:36.660
<v Speaker 2>aspect of the archetypal individuals </v>
<v Speaker 2>west.</v>

1588
01:25:37.150 --> 01:25:37.983
<v Speaker 2>This is memphis off these credo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world is such a horrible place </v>

1589
01:25:42.221 --> 01:25:43.054
<v Speaker 2>intrinsically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the best thing you can do for it is </v>

1590
01:25:45.551 --> 01:25:48.280
<v Speaker 2>to work for its eradication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1591
01:25:48.430 --> 01:25:50.770
<v Speaker 2>lots of people except that line of </v>
<v Speaker 2>argumentation.</v>

1592
01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:52.031
<v Speaker 2>I mean you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1593
01:25:52.031 --> 01:25:52.864
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why did the Nazis killed 6 million </v>

1594
01:25:54.041 --> 01:25:55.150
<v Speaker 2>Jews?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1595
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.823
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to say exactly why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I suspect that at the bottom of the </v>

1596
01:25:59.891 --> 01:26:04.100
<v Speaker 2>individual psyches that participated in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of act was the notion that,</v>

1597
01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:05.473
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after all the world isn't relatively </v>

1598
01:26:06.471 --> 01:26:07.304
<v Speaker 2>harsh an unfair place and it might not </v>
<v Speaker 2>be so bad to take a little bit of </v>

1599
01:26:09.651 --> 01:26:10.490
<v Speaker 2>revenge against it.</v>

1600
01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:13.320
<v Speaker 2>It's like balancing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1601
01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:14.233
<v Speaker 2>it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world has done a lot of terrible </v>

1602
01:26:15.891 --> 01:26:18.410
<v Speaker 2>things to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like what's your attitude to that?</v>

1603
01:26:18.710 --> 01:26:19.543
<v Speaker 2>Revenge is one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like all she'll do those all show </v>

1604
01:26:22.611 --> 01:26:25.080
<v Speaker 2>those whatever the hem to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll show those jeeps,</v>

1605
01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:29.780
<v Speaker 2>whoever you pick as your target for </v>
<v Speaker 2>having inappropriate be persecuted you.</v>

1606
01:26:30.710 --> 01:26:31.461
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

1607
01:26:31.461 --> 01:26:32.294
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm trying to do is to get at the </v>

1608
01:26:32.931 --> 01:26:35.690
<v Speaker 2>bottom of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why would people be like that?</v>

1609
01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:37.193
<v Speaker 2>I think it has something to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The necessary consequences of self </v>

1610
01:26:40.481 --> 01:26:42.800
<v Speaker 2>consciousness as soon as your self </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious.</v>

1611
01:26:42.801 --> 01:26:44.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the genesis story says it quite clearly.</v>

1612
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:46.183
<v Speaker 2>What happens when you cover yourself up </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're ashamed and why are you </v>

1613
01:26:50.041 --> 01:26:51.710
<v Speaker 2>ashamed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you know you're naked.</v>

1614
01:26:51.890 --> 01:26:54.650
<v Speaker 2>But what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means that you can view yourself as a</v>

1615
01:26:54.651 --> 01:26:57.110
<v Speaker 2>somewhat vulnerable pink thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That really could be</v>

1616
01:26:58.730 --> 01:27:01.250
<v Speaker 2>who's also subject to all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>social pressures,</v>

1617
01:27:01.251 --> 01:27:02.084
<v Speaker 2>many of which are negative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who needs a substantial amount of </v>

1618
01:27:04.071 --> 01:27:06.980
<v Speaker 2>protection just to ensure survival </v>
<v Speaker 2>continued from day to day.</v>

1619
01:27:07.570 --> 01:27:09.800
<v Speaker 2>Give an even that that survival is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>doubtful,</v>

1620
01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:13.460
<v Speaker 2>is doubtful in the long run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the basis of shame.</v>

1621
01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:16.490
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that happens in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>genesis story is as soon as Adam and eve</v>

1622
01:27:16.491 --> 01:27:17.450
<v Speaker 2>discovery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're naked,</v>

1623
01:27:17.810 --> 01:27:20.600
<v Speaker 2>God comes walking through the garden and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're hiding.</v>

1624
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:22.663
<v Speaker 2>Why would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a strange bit of the story is </v>

1625
01:27:23.901 --> 01:27:26.030
<v Speaker 2>why would you hide one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A few things,</v>

1626
01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:29.190
<v Speaker 2>say maybe you could look at it this way </v>
<v Speaker 2>then</v>

1627
01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:34.190
<v Speaker 2>from the mythological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God's voice,</v>

1628
01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:35.233
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the thing that calls you to do your </v>

1629
01:27:38.421 --> 01:27:41.630
<v Speaker 2>basket to perform to the maximum of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>ability,</v>

1630
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:44.750
<v Speaker 2>and why wouldn't you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you hide from that?</v>

1631
01:27:45.050 --> 01:27:47.870
<v Speaker 2>And the truth of the matter of reasons </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we all hide from that.</v>

1632
01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:49.093
<v Speaker 2>Because what we recognize most </v>
<v Speaker 2>profoundly about ourselves as our </v>

1633
01:27:51.171 --> 01:27:52.004
<v Speaker 2>inadequacies and those inadequacies make</v>
<v Speaker 2>it impossible for us to believe that we </v>

1634
01:27:55.581 --> 01:27:57.500
<v Speaker 2>could do our master that would even be </v>
<v Speaker 2>worth doing.</v>

1635
01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:01.730
<v Speaker 2>And that's what the story about hiding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And certainly the case that we do that.</v>

1636
01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:04.070
<v Speaker 2>So what happens if you hide from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best in you?</v>

1637
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:06.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know if that's the archetypal hero,</v>

1638
01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:08.293
<v Speaker 2>you hide from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have no defense at all against </v>

1639
01:28:09.861 --> 01:28:10.694
<v Speaker 2>chaos because that is the defense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abandoned that because you're afraid </v>

1640
01:28:15.710 --> 01:28:16.543
<v Speaker 2>what's left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that's left is the </v>

1641
01:28:17.631 --> 01:28:21.320
<v Speaker 2>protection of the group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you abandon what's best in you,</v>

1642
01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:23.780
<v Speaker 2>the only thing you can do is become </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian.</v>

1643
01:28:24.410 --> 01:28:26.330
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while lots of things happen.</v>

1644
01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:27.613
<v Speaker 2>So you have to have the group that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if it disappears your gap </v>

1645
01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:32.053
<v Speaker 2>because there's nothing left of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus anyone that's out there that </v>

1646
01:28:34.791 --> 01:28:37.220
<v Speaker 2>reminds you of what you might've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>you hate.</v>

1647
01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:39.453
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you have a good reason for </v>

1648
01:28:39.921 --> 01:28:42.930
<v Speaker 2>rubbing them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the job's doing through this?</v>

1649
01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:45.640
<v Speaker 2>Isn't this what Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the book of job is been?</v>

1650
01:28:46.130 --> 01:28:50.930
<v Speaker 2>Well you don't view that book as a sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a narrative precursor to the story of</v>

1651
01:28:50.931 --> 01:28:54.350
<v Speaker 2>a Christian redemption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he said it was like the whole,</v>

1652
01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:55.213
<v Speaker 2>the whole Bible basically tells a </v>
<v Speaker 2>redemption story and that one of the </v>

1653
01:28:58.491 --> 01:29:02.550
<v Speaker 2>things that the story of job </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessitated was the emergence of a full</v>

1654
01:29:02.551 --> 01:29:05.940
<v Speaker 2>blown hero myth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why fry says for example,</v>

1655
01:29:05.941 --> 01:29:08.940
<v Speaker 2>that the idea of Christ is embedded in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the old testament.</v>

1656
01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:10.193
<v Speaker 2>It's implicit in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to say that the Old Testament </v>

1657
01:29:12.451 --> 01:29:13.284
<v Speaker 2>is a story that cries out for a hero and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's also why there are notions of </v>

1658
01:29:17.941 --> 01:29:19.050
<v Speaker 2>prophecy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

1659
01:29:19.051 --> 01:29:21.780
<v Speaker 2>saying this person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the millennium is going to arrive,</v>

1660
01:29:21.781 --> 01:29:24.000
<v Speaker 2>which is to say where we are in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>position,</v>

1661
01:29:24.001 --> 01:29:28.230
<v Speaker 2>which is this position that calls for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1662
01:29:29.460 --> 01:29:31.170
<v Speaker 2>we know the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to be here.</v>

1663
01:29:31.171 --> 01:29:32.004
<v Speaker 2>The rest of the story is the arrival of </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that will move us out of </v>

1664
01:29:34.291 --> 01:29:35.124
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like these are all people that are </v>

1665
01:29:36.511 --> 01:29:38.430
<v Speaker 2>caught in the belly of the beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example.</v>

1666
01:29:38.431 --> 01:29:41.670
<v Speaker 2>They're waiting for the hero to go down </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the belly and freedom.</v>

1667
01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:46.710
<v Speaker 2>So it's such a kind of unsatisfying </v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

1668
01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:48.570
<v Speaker 2>The job's story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1669
01:29:48.630 --> 01:29:49.710
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Makes perfect sense.</v>

1670
01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:50.700
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1671
01:29:50.701 --> 01:29:55.701
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a chunk of on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is Joe Joe his story?</v>

1672
01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:04.080
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause he never learned what to do.</v>

1673
01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:09.440
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The arbitrary nature has this big speech</v>

1674
01:30:10.891 --> 01:30:13.470
<v Speaker 2>about how wonderful wisdom and isn't how</v>
<v Speaker 2>God created the world.</v>

1675
01:30:13.471 --> 01:30:14.304
<v Speaker 2>And since he created it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has the intimate knowledge of how </v>

1676
01:30:15.721 --> 01:30:16.554
<v Speaker 2>everything works and to wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then God comes in a world when </v>

1677
01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:21.900
<v Speaker 2>instead it's like I'm God European on </v>
<v Speaker 2>suck it up.</v>

1678
01:30:22.780 --> 01:30:24.090
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

1679
01:30:24.270 --> 01:30:26.010
<v Speaker 2>And then he gets all this stuff he ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>lost.</v>

1680
01:30:26.130 --> 01:30:28.720
<v Speaker 2>What would you rather suck it up or </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out what to do for yourself?</v>

1681
01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:30.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing you can do.</v>

1682
01:30:30.121 --> 01:30:31.130
<v Speaker 2>It was it like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh completely.</v>

1683
01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:31.973
<v Speaker 2>But that's not the message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The message of Christ is that there is </v>

1684
01:30:34.111 --> 01:30:35.840
<v Speaker 2>something that you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this was</v>

1685
01:30:37.610 --> 01:30:39.360
<v Speaker 2>the message of Christ and the story of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

1686
01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:40.553
<v Speaker 2>the whole like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at what job's like predicated on </v>

1687
01:30:42.001 --> 01:30:43.850
<v Speaker 2>like Gods and God and Satan there.</v>

1688
01:30:46.050 --> 01:30:49.260
<v Speaker 2>Which is kind of an interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1689
01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:51.033
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

1690
01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:54.270
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there,</v>

1691
01:30:54.430 --> 01:30:55.320
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a book,</v>

1692
01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:58.260
<v Speaker 2>there's a book that was written </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically to address this problem,</v>

1693
01:30:58.261 --> 01:31:01.310
<v Speaker 2>which is answered to Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I assume stealing spoke it.</v>

1694
01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:02.353
<v Speaker 2>Him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1695
01:31:02.450 --> 01:31:03.283
<v Speaker 2>Describes this issue particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we also want to make sure that we </v>

1696
01:31:05.251 --> 01:31:07.600
<v Speaker 2>can distinguish g,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1697
01:31:09.150 --> 01:31:12.000
<v Speaker 2>or that we put the story of job sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a broader perspective,</v>

1698
01:31:12.001 --> 01:31:12.834
<v Speaker 2>which is the story of someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>desperate fundamentally for very good </v>

1699
01:31:15.151 --> 01:31:15.984
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing about desperation in </v>

1700
01:31:18.721 --> 01:31:21.150
<v Speaker 2>general is that it calls out for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>solution.</v>

1701
01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:22.190
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all off.</v>

1702
01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:23.233
<v Speaker 2>The only appointment I was making is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the story of job is the story of </v>

1703
01:31:25.681 --> 01:31:29.040
<v Speaker 2>someone who's in as desperate as </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances as can be imagined.</v>

1704
01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:30.720
<v Speaker 2>And that's how the story is structured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1705
01:31:30.730 --> 01:31:31.563
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't get us and he doesn't get </v>

1706
01:31:33.410 --> 01:31:36.720
<v Speaker 2>solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a solution,</v>

1707
01:31:36.721 --> 01:31:40.350
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the best solution or one </v>
<v Speaker 2>they appeal to our sense of fairness.</v>

1708
01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:43.680
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly the issue though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly this problem.</v>

1709
01:31:43.710 --> 01:31:47.010
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes it on satisfactory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly the issue.</v>

1710
01:31:47.060 --> 01:31:48.840
<v Speaker 2>We demand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fairness exists,</v>

1711
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:51.580
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we do to map that.</v>

1712
01:31:53.470 --> 01:31:54.303
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't.</v>

1713
01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:56.460
<v Speaker 2>No we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because as soon as you get past that,</v>

1714
01:31:56.461 --> 01:31:58.950
<v Speaker 2>then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say we'll abandon fairness as a,</v>

1715
01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:00.130
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you better</v>

1716
01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:03.460
<v Speaker 1>watch out for me then well then if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it from God's point of view,</v>

1717
01:32:03.461 --> 01:32:04.294
<v Speaker 1>it was fair because God is God and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do whatever he wants and there </v>

1718
01:32:06.341 --> 01:32:07.174
<v Speaker 1>wasn't preexistent bet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it's very hard for us to separate </v>

1719
01:32:11.601 --> 01:32:13.800
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what religion is for.</v>

1720
01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:16.390
<v Speaker 1>You have to have faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some greater like plan out there</v>

1721
01:32:16.391 --> 01:32:19.810
<v Speaker 1>that we can only see a small snippet up </v>
<v Speaker 1>so we can't possibly understand so well.</v>

1722
01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:20.673
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just consider for a moment that </v>

1723
01:32:26.321 --> 01:32:27.154
<v Speaker 1>some of the fundamental interpretations </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these things are culturally bound by </v>

1724
01:32:30.971 --> 01:32:35.971
<v Speaker 1>the Christian tradition that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily universal questions are,</v>

1725
01:32:36.990 --> 01:32:37.823
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1726
01:32:38.050 --> 01:32:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Well this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a problem,</v>

1727
01:32:39.671 --> 01:32:43.330
<v Speaker 1>but that's why I said that we should try</v>
<v Speaker 1>and look at the story sort of outside of</v>

1728
01:32:43.331 --> 01:32:45.400
<v Speaker 1>both traditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that would be possible.</v>

1729
01:32:45.650 --> 01:32:49.240
<v Speaker 1>And to see it as a story of something of</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's getting the aspiration.</v>

1730
01:32:49.390 --> 01:32:54.390
<v Speaker 1>That's all</v>
<v Speaker 1>true enough.</v>

1731
01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:55.953
<v Speaker 1>I mean unless we got a very diverse </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of peoples from all the </v>

1732
01:33:00.741 --> 01:33:01.574
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's kind of what we're hoping </v>

1733
01:33:03.071 --> 01:33:06.160
<v Speaker 1>seeped in the Judeo Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>True enough,</v>

1734
01:33:06.161 --> 01:33:08.170
<v Speaker 1>but that's what we're trying to do in </v>
<v Speaker 1>part in this class.</v>

1735
01:33:08.171 --> 01:33:09.004
<v Speaker 1>Even though in terms of personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation we don't have like we're </v>

1736
01:33:11.561 --> 01:33:13.570
<v Speaker 1>not as diverse a group as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be.</v>

1737
01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:14.553
<v Speaker 1>What are the things hopefully that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to do is contrast and compare </v>

1738
01:33:16.961 --> 01:33:21.700
<v Speaker 1>enough traditions so that we can see the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories that are common to all of them.</v>

1739
01:33:22.150 --> 01:33:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Now this is going to be a problem in all</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of different ways,</v>

1740
01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:30.250
<v Speaker 1>but I'm hoping that the enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>information in general,</v>

1741
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:31.143
<v Speaker 1>not just in the context of this class </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been gathered so that we can start </v>

1742
01:33:34.541 --> 01:33:37.090
<v Speaker 1>to see patterns that transcend </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>

1743
01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:41.170
<v Speaker 1>particular viewpoints without </v>
<v Speaker 1>undermining how do you avoid the problem</v>

1744
01:33:41.171 --> 01:33:42.004
<v Speaker 1>of seeking confirmation and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions so that you have already </v>

1745
01:33:45.341 --> 01:33:46.174
<v Speaker 1>within one tradition a sense of what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental elements and then because </v>

1746
01:33:50.861 --> 01:33:54.190
<v Speaker 1>traditions are broad and inclusive you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can find good question.</v>

1747
01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:55.713
<v Speaker 1>Good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ones that are most important to you </v>

1748
01:33:57.281 --> 01:34:00.850
<v Speaker 1>and how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you avoid that problem of bias?</v>

1749
01:34:00.910 --> 01:34:02.350
<v Speaker 1>That's an excellent question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1750
01:34:02.380 --> 01:34:03.790
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an absolutely,</v>

1751
01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:05.013
<v Speaker 1>absolutely solid question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fundamental like I think one of the </v>

1752
01:34:07.841 --> 01:34:08.674
<v Speaker 1>reasons why there has been such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>discrepancy between scientific </v>

1753
01:34:12.101 --> 01:34:12.934
<v Speaker 1>viewpoints and mythological viewpoints </v>
<v Speaker 1>is because in science we have a mode of </v>

1754
01:34:17.411 --> 01:34:19.960
<v Speaker 1>determining what comes to or institutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>of truth,</v>

1755
01:34:19.961 --> 01:34:20.794
<v Speaker 1>at least provisional truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of the desires of the </v>

1756
01:34:23.081 --> 01:34:25.660
<v Speaker 1>exponents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of any given at any given truth.</v>

1757
01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:26.903
<v Speaker 1>Here's a methodology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with moral viewpoints is </v>

1758
01:34:29.831 --> 01:34:33.520
<v Speaker 1>that we don't have a methodology now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this may be in some ways,</v>

1759
01:34:33.550 --> 01:34:34.383
<v Speaker 1>in some ways it's an insoluble problem I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think because I don't think that we can </v>

1760
01:34:36.701 --> 01:34:41.701
<v Speaker 1>come to a conclusion about what is good</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the same sort of process of consensus</v>

1761
01:34:42.791 --> 01:34:45.940
<v Speaker 1>necessarily that we use in science </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's hard to point to an object.</v>

1762
01:34:46.810 --> 01:34:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then the question as well,</v>

1763
01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:52.060
<v Speaker 1>so how do you get to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what comes to mind?</v>

1764
01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:54.220
<v Speaker 1>What might constitute a fact?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1765
01:34:54.221 --> 01:34:58.280
<v Speaker 1>the only way that I can see that it can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be done is by looking</v>

1766
01:34:58.280 --> 01:34:59.113
<v Speaker 2>at various cultures and various </v>
<v Speaker 2>historical traditions and also by </v>

1767
01:35:02.751 --> 01:35:05.240
<v Speaker 2>drawing in information from other fields</v>
<v Speaker 2>of endeavor,</v>

1768
01:35:05.241 --> 01:35:06.074
<v Speaker 2>if that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I've been trying to look at </v>

1769
01:35:07.851 --> 01:35:08.684
<v Speaker 2>both the neuropsychology of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional brought an information </v>

1770
01:35:11.121 --> 01:35:15.050
<v Speaker 2>processing plus looking at at various </v>
<v Speaker 2>historical traditions.</v>

1771
01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:20.380
<v Speaker 2>So the problem of looking for what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want and finding it is a big problem and</v>

1772
01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:22.153
<v Speaker 2>maybe there isn't an entirely </v>
<v Speaker 2>satisfactory solution of the present </v>

1773
01:35:24.471 --> 01:35:25.304
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it strikes me that there's enough </v>

1774
01:35:26.811 --> 01:35:30.650
<v Speaker 2>data gathering so that we can at least </v>
<v Speaker 2>make some movements towards that end.</v>

1775
01:35:31.730 --> 01:35:36.380
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I have a solution.</v>

1776
01:35:39.020 --> 01:35:40.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is good training program.</v>

1777
01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:41.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1778
01:35:41.791 --> 01:35:43.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it would,</v>

1779
01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:45.000
<v Speaker 2>I think that would be the hardest way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

1780
01:35:45.001 --> 01:35:47.580
<v Speaker 2>The way you're doing it now is I </v>
<v Speaker 2>presented it in a conscious level,</v>

1781
01:35:47.850 --> 01:35:49.810
<v Speaker 2>but I think you'd be presented on an </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious of them.</v>

1782
01:35:49.811 --> 01:35:50.644
<v Speaker 2>Create your own story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course you have to have </v>

1783
01:35:52.351 --> 01:35:55.920
<v Speaker 2>confidence in you and what you've come </v>
<v Speaker 2>up with and see that it is,</v>

1784
01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:56.773
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that is more right or </v>

1785
01:35:57.301 --> 01:35:58.170
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>

1786
01:35:58.340 --> 01:35:59.173
<v Speaker 2>you create the story and through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>behaviors that are embodied in the </v>

1787
01:36:01.411 --> 01:36:02.244
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are passing on this kind of wisdom </v>

1788
01:36:03.541 --> 01:36:04.374
<v Speaker 2>knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing that Jesus did in making </v>

1789
01:36:06.301 --> 01:36:08.040
<v Speaker 2>his parables and other figurative </v>
<v Speaker 2>language stuff.</v>

1790
01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:10.740
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well he was able to pass that on through</v>

1791
01:36:10.741 --> 01:36:11.790
<v Speaker 2>those stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not necessarily.</v>

1792
01:36:11.890 --> 01:36:12.723
<v Speaker 2>This is also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is also an issue with regards to </v>

1793
01:36:14.251 --> 01:36:15.084
<v Speaker 2>the methodology.</v>

1794
01:36:15.170 --> 01:36:16.003
<v Speaker 2>The problem with with discussing truths </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how to add is that the only form </v>

1795
01:36:20.101 --> 01:36:22.650
<v Speaker 2>that you can actually test them out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>use it in your own experience.</v>

1796
01:36:23.190 --> 01:36:24.090
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you say,</v>

1797
01:36:24.091 --> 01:36:26.910
<v Speaker 2>why should act such and such a way you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't ask anybody else,</v>

1798
01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:29.220
<v Speaker 2>should I act this way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they can't tell you.</v>

1799
01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:31.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean you might go to hell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should listen to them.</v>

1800
01:36:31.081 --> 01:36:32.670
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they have some good information </v>
<v Speaker 2>for you.</v>

1801
01:36:32.850 --> 01:36:33.683
<v Speaker 2>But in the final analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the only one that can figure out </v>

1802
01:36:35.041 --> 01:36:37.350
<v Speaker 2>if the way you're acting is right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not only that,</v>

1803
01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:38.213
<v Speaker 2>it's worse than that because you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>define the criteria by which you </v>

1804
01:36:41.701 --> 01:36:44.160
<v Speaker 2>determine if the way you're acting is </v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriate.</v>

1805
01:36:44.190 --> 01:36:45.230
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>

1806
01:36:45.290 --> 01:36:48.360
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of caught with decisions to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make the matter which way you look.</v>

1807
01:36:48.810 --> 01:36:49.643
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things that I'm going </v>

1808
01:36:50.281 --> 01:36:51.114
<v Speaker 2>to try to address later in the later in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the course because these sorts of </v>

1809
01:36:54.031 --> 01:36:56.750
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these sorts of things pop up being,</v>

1810
01:36:58.230 --> 01:37:00.870
<v Speaker 2>since you can't rely on anyone else in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the final analysis,</v>

1811
01:37:00.871 --> 01:37:02.010
<v Speaker 2>you have to rely on yourself.</v>

1812
01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:02.970
<v Speaker 2>And then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1813
01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:05.490
<v Speaker 2>how is it that you can be sure that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can rely on yourself?</v>

1814
01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:07.620
<v Speaker 2>Why do you say that you can't rely on </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody else?</v>

1815
01:37:07.621 --> 01:37:08.760
<v Speaker 2>You have to realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1816
01:37:08.790 --> 01:37:11.310
<v Speaker 2>partly because nobody else can feel your</v>
<v Speaker 2>pain.</v>

1817
01:37:11.850 --> 01:37:13.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the basic,</v>

1818
01:37:13.441 --> 01:37:15.330
<v Speaker 2>because there's an aspect of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

1819
01:37:15.331 --> 01:37:19.440
<v Speaker 2>the subjective aspect of no one else has</v>
<v Speaker 2>access to and what's right for you.</v>

1820
01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:22.230
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to share,</v>

1821
01:37:22.590 --> 01:37:23.423
<v Speaker 2>there's gonna be overlap between that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what's right with other people and </v>

1822
01:37:25.951 --> 01:37:28.890
<v Speaker 2>what's always be going to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's gonna be unique to you.</v>

1823
01:37:29.220 --> 01:37:31.540
<v Speaker 1>What about the what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about recap?</v>

1824
01:37:31.740 --> 01:37:32.573
<v Speaker 1>We cast a lot of this whole thing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of interpersonal interactions as </v>

1825
01:37:36.391 --> 01:37:39.150
<v Speaker 1>opposed to an individual's actions </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the world.</v>

1826
01:37:39.151 --> 01:37:39.984
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you were talking about how the </v>

1827
01:37:41.431 --> 01:37:44.520
<v Speaker 1>child learns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the child explores his territory,</v>

1828
01:37:44.521 --> 01:37:45.380
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1829
01:37:45.390 --> 01:37:46.223
<v Speaker 1>Jillian [inaudible] information and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother is there as sort of a protector </v>

1830
01:37:51.091 --> 01:37:54.600
<v Speaker 1>to protect you from the world rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than using a whole nother way of looking</v>

1831
01:37:54.601 --> 01:37:56.520
<v Speaker 1>at that same child learns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

1832
01:37:56.521 --> 01:37:57.354
<v Speaker 1>interacting with the mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think absolutely top of the story of </v>

1833
01:38:01.171 --> 01:38:02.004
<v Speaker 1>Buddha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddha goes out into the world rather </v>

1834
01:38:03.721 --> 01:38:04.554
<v Speaker 1>than anomalous information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the interactions with the sick </v>

1835
01:38:07.141 --> 01:38:09.720
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an old person in a dead person,</v>

1836
01:38:09.721 --> 01:38:11.730
<v Speaker 1>but these are interactions that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>previously,</v>

1837
01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:13.863
<v Speaker 1>look at this diagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the ways that an individual </v>

1838
01:38:18.721 --> 01:38:21.810
<v Speaker 1>generates information is through going </v>
<v Speaker 1>back with the unknown,</v>

1839
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:23.303
<v Speaker 1>but the other way that he generates </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation is through contact with </v>

1840
01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:26.250
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

1841
01:38:26.250 --> 01:38:27.083
<v Speaker 1>And in the case that you're describing </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the mother who is providing </v>

1842
01:38:29.071 --> 01:38:32.580
<v Speaker 1>information as an intermediary for </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture but also another person,</v>

1843
01:38:32.581 --> 01:38:36.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1844
01:38:36.121 --> 01:38:39.510
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of cultural information is </v>
<v Speaker 1>embedded in other people,</v>

1845
01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:41.710
<v Speaker 1>not just in what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me how many APP?</v>

1846
01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:43.740
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you interact with someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

1847
01:38:43.741 --> 01:38:44.574
<v Speaker 1>they're providing you with all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural information in the interaction </v>

1848
01:38:48.060 --> 01:38:50.100
<v Speaker 1>or is there still something else you </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean?</v>

1849
01:38:50.610 --> 01:38:52.440
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1850
01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:56.280
<v Speaker 1>Asking some of these questions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked a lot of these same questions,</v>

1851
01:38:56.910 --> 01:38:59.160
<v Speaker 1>but my area of concentration in social </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology</v>

1852
01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:04.670
<v Speaker 1>and I spent a lot of time trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what level to ask a question.</v>

1853
01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:07.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why does an individual harbored,</v>

1854
01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:11.190
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to create,</v>

1855
01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:14.790
<v Speaker 1>to do her ethic that or what is it about</v>
<v Speaker 1>a group?</v>

1856
01:39:15.410 --> 01:39:16.243
<v Speaker 1>Okay that needs the group to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>clarifications or what is it about the </v>

1857
01:39:19.111 --> 01:39:19.944
<v Speaker 1>dynamics between two groups that causes </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them to do these things to the </v>

1858
01:39:23.251 --> 01:39:24.000
<v Speaker 1>other one?</v>

1859
01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:24.833
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me that you can ask the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question at every level and it's hard </v>

1860
01:39:27.961 --> 01:39:32.961
<v Speaker 1>for me to understand why one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this views of all of those levels put</v>

1861
01:39:33.241 --> 01:39:34.074
<v Speaker 1>together or is it focusing on one limits</v>
<v Speaker 1>to things like it's an attempt to </v>

1862
01:39:36.961 --> 01:39:40.700
<v Speaker 1>integrate</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas about group car.</v>

1863
01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:41.853
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1864
01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:45.400
<v Speaker 1>the question really for me as an why do </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups engaged in cons?</v>

1865
01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:46.973
<v Speaker 1>It's why do the individuals that make up</v>
<v Speaker 1>those groups actually conducting </v>

1866
01:39:50.290 --> 01:39:52.590
<v Speaker 1>individual acts that make up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict?</v>

1867
01:39:52.990 --> 01:39:55.680
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And since I'm interested in,</v>

1868
01:39:55.681 --> 01:39:59.490
<v Speaker 1>in the individual as like the four </v>
<v Speaker 1>runner of the group,</v>

1869
01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:00.593
<v Speaker 1>what can the individual do personally to</v>
<v Speaker 1>reduce the likelihood that given the </v>

1870
01:40:04.921 --> 01:40:08.250
<v Speaker 1>preconditions they will engage in those </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of peripheric actions?</v>

1871
01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:11.670
<v Speaker 1>That's my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like specifically that's my concern</v>

1872
01:40:14.490 --> 01:40:16.350
<v Speaker 1>in which individuals are doing these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1873
01:40:16.351 --> 01:40:19.890
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I were a Nazi teachers</v>

1874
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:24.030
<v Speaker 1>Nazi in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>German,</v>

1875
01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:26.690
<v Speaker 1>and my job was to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

1876
01:40:26.700 --> 01:40:29.280
<v Speaker 1>throw the switch on the train line </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere down the line.</v>

1877
01:40:29.700 --> 01:40:31.740
<v Speaker 1>And you may ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now why would I do that?</v>

1878
01:40:32.370 --> 01:40:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one reason is because if I don't do it,</v>

1879
01:40:34.201 --> 01:40:36.000
<v Speaker 1>somebody else will do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1880
01:40:36.001 --> 01:40:37.430
<v Speaker 1>that becomes irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

1881
01:40:37.431 --> 01:40:38.264
<v Speaker 1>why did I throw the switch?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the switch is going to get </v>

1882
01:40:40.231 --> 01:40:41.850
<v Speaker 1>thrown whether I threw it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1883
01:40:41.851 --> 01:40:42.900
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1884
01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:43.830
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's uh,</v>

1885
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:44.730
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1886
01:40:46.020 --> 01:40:50.460
<v Speaker 1>well that's a very untoward or arguments</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar in some ways to also carrying it</v>

1887
01:40:50.461 --> 01:40:52.230
<v Speaker 1>on as a consequence of borders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1888
01:40:52.530 --> 01:40:54.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a hierarchy.</v>

1889
01:40:54.340 --> 01:40:55.173
<v Speaker 2>Why did I throw the switch?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm asking why are you asking why did I </v>

1890
01:40:57.131 --> 01:40:58.300
<v Speaker 2>throw the switch?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>

1891
01:40:58.310 --> 01:41:01.510
<v Speaker 2>don't ask me why I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ask me why the switch got thrown in.</v>

1892
01:41:01.630 --> 01:41:02.463
<v Speaker 2>To answer that question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you'll have to look at something </v>

1893
01:41:04.150 --> 01:41:05.620
<v Speaker 2>beyond me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

1894
01:41:06.130 --> 01:41:08.190
<v Speaker 2>I would say you don't have to look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1895
01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:09.533
<v Speaker 2>I would say that it was the pattern of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your whole life up to the point where </v>

1896
01:41:13.451 --> 01:41:14.284
<v Speaker 2>you threw the switch that made you into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sort of creature that would think </v>

1897
01:41:17.141 --> 01:41:20.170
<v Speaker 2>that that was a normal app.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Kinda Rod said,</v>

1898
01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:24.550
<v Speaker 2>people has been out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she was wrong actually.</v>

1899
01:41:24.551 --> 01:41:25.384
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's not valid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just that many of the things that </v>

1900
01:41:27.701 --> 01:41:32.440
<v Speaker 2>we think are but now are actually heat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's this things,</v>

1901
01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:35.470
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we do every day that don't have any</v>

1902
01:41:35.471 --> 01:41:36.640
<v Speaker 2>immediate consequence.</v>

1903
01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:38.950
<v Speaker 2>We write them off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there've been out,</v>

1904
01:41:39.010 --> 01:41:39.843
<v Speaker 2>but they're not by now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you look at what you're </v>

1905
01:41:41.321 --> 01:41:42.154
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the consequences of that over time or </v>

1906
01:41:44.141 --> 01:41:44.974
<v Speaker 2>say why does society is going say well </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because the individuals that </v>

1907
01:41:48.910 --> 01:41:53.290
<v Speaker 2>composable conduct the activities that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they think are saying no one notices,</v>

1908
01:41:53.291 --> 01:41:54.124
<v Speaker 2>no one said anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not saying they're completely </v>

1909
01:41:56.051 --> 01:41:56.884
<v Speaker 2>off the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the culmination of all those </v>

1910
01:41:58.840 --> 01:41:59.673
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] actions is a society </v>
<v Speaker 2>composed of individuals that all things </v>

1911
01:42:03.421 --> 01:42:06.320
<v Speaker 2>are good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are acting on mass and an absolutely</v>

1912
01:42:06.340 --> 01:42:08.980
<v Speaker 2>boring way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So say in part,</v>

1913
01:42:08.981 --> 01:42:11.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean one of the things I'd be trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to answers,</v>

1914
01:42:11.150 --> 01:42:11.983
<v Speaker 2>they just question posed in the late 18 </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds he said are their </v>

1915
01:42:14.471 --> 01:42:17.890
<v Speaker 2>psychopathology is of health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what he meant was,</v>

1916
01:42:18.010 --> 01:42:21.130
<v Speaker 2>was it possible for someone to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly normal and well adjusted,</v>

1917
01:42:21.150 --> 01:42:21.983
<v Speaker 2>well adapted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they did an admirable by the </v>

1918
01:42:23.321 --> 01:42:26.440
<v Speaker 2>standards of their society and still be </v>
<v Speaker 2>sick.</v>

1919
01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:30.400
<v Speaker 2>And you know from the perspective of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural relativism,</v>

1920
01:42:30.401 --> 01:42:31.234
<v Speaker 2>the answer's no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But from the perspective of the number </v>

1921
01:42:33.321 --> 01:42:35.410
<v Speaker 2>of trials to answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>

1922
01:42:35.890 --> 01:42:36.723
<v Speaker 2>So what I'm trying to figure out is if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be sick by doing what everyone </v>

1923
01:42:39.611 --> 01:42:40.444
<v Speaker 2>else is doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that imply that there's some </v>

1924
01:42:42.791 --> 01:42:45.520
<v Speaker 2>universal standard by which being sick </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be judged?</v>

1925
01:42:45.810 --> 01:42:46.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well yes.</v>

1926
01:42:46.691 --> 01:42:51.400
<v Speaker 2>Three this says if you are open to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence of anomalous information,</v>

1927
01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:52.473
<v Speaker 2>you admitted it when it occurs and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>update your behavioral models as a </v>

1928
01:42:55.361 --> 01:42:56.920
<v Speaker 2>consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're healthy.</v>

1929
01:42:57.070 --> 01:43:01.010
<v Speaker 2>If you're not well then you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can an individual do that?</v>

1930
01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:07.570
<v Speaker 2>How can I in the train station admit the</v>
<v Speaker 2>anomalous information?</v>

1931
01:43:08.210 --> 01:43:11.110
<v Speaker 2>Actually there's two preconditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What has been,</v>

1932
01:43:11.111 --> 01:43:11.944
<v Speaker 2>you have to admit that you're vulnerable</v>
<v Speaker 2>to even to being killed and to accept </v>

1933
01:43:17.111 --> 01:43:17.944
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the second is to to risk putting up </v>

1934
01:43:20.021 --> 01:43:22.000
<v Speaker 2>with the fact that the group might </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually do it too.</v>

1935
01:43:23.110 --> 01:43:25.120
<v Speaker 2>So that's what you have to do that </v>
<v Speaker 2>delete the group.</v>

1936
01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:27.330
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1937
01:43:27.331 --> 01:43:29.380
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to leave the group knowing that</v>

1938
01:43:29.381 --> 01:43:30.214
<v Speaker 2>if you do leave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might kill you and are very </v>

1939
01:43:33.071 --> 01:43:33.904
<v Speaker 2>motivated to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a classic hero myth as well </v>

1940
01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:38.500
<v Speaker 2>as the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's two things,</v>

1941
01:43:38.830 --> 01:43:41.470
<v Speaker 2>death weights at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so does the negative reaction of the</v>

1942
01:43:41.471 --> 01:43:42.304
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you want to transcend the group </v>

1943
01:43:44.100 --> 01:43:45.280
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you do.</v>

1944
01:43:45.460 --> 01:43:48.370
<v Speaker 2>Say can you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was too much for any individual to</v>

1945
01:43:48.371 --> 01:43:50.020
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the,</v>

1946
01:43:50.050 --> 01:43:52.010
<v Speaker 2>that's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would</v>

1947
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:53.120
<v Speaker 1>say it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of,</v>

1948
01:43:53.150 --> 01:43:55.480
<v Speaker 1>there's a paradox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a paradoxical solution.</v>

1949
01:43:55.550 --> 01:43:56.383
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you tried it is possible that if one </v>

1950
01:44:01.191 --> 01:44:03.200
<v Speaker 1>tried it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be possible.</v>

1951
01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:04.633
<v Speaker 1>And if it were possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may be that there were side effects </v>

1952
01:44:07.161 --> 01:44:07.994
<v Speaker 1>to doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might actually eliminate all the </v>

1953
01:44:09.861 --> 01:44:12.980
<v Speaker 1>things that appear negative about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1954
01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:14.030
<v Speaker 1>and I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

1955
01:44:14.031 --> 01:44:14.864
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the basic problem is how do you </v>

1956
01:44:16.041 --> 01:44:21.041
<v Speaker 1>adapt to the presence of chaos</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's unfair and unjust aspects?</v>

1957
01:44:22.551 --> 01:44:24.680
<v Speaker 1>Cause what ways do you identify with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>group?</v>

1958
01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:28.730
<v Speaker 1>That's what the groups for the other way</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you learn how to deal with it on</v>

1959
01:44:28.731 --> 01:44:33.110
<v Speaker 1>your own and the questions can you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if the answer is yes,</v>

1960
01:44:33.740 --> 01:44:34.573
<v Speaker 1>then that implies that you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different sort of creature than you </v>

1961
01:44:36.231 --> 01:44:37.064
<v Speaker 1>think you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a different sort of </v>

1962
01:44:38.661 --> 01:44:39.494
<v Speaker 1>creature than you think you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the world is not configured it </v>

1963
01:44:42.021 --> 01:44:43.340
<v Speaker 1>unfair and unjust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1964
01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:44.713
<v Speaker 1>It may be that it appears that it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have an inadequate opinion </v>

1965
01:44:48.380 --> 01:44:49.213
<v Speaker 1>of your own power to adapt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that the purpose of </v>

1966
01:44:52.041 --> 01:44:57.041
<v Speaker 1>pyramids generally is to provide you </v>
<v Speaker 1>with some evidence home from history.</v>

1967
01:44:59.870 --> 01:45:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Then there's far more to the individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>that meets the odd enough,</v>

1968
01:45:04.191 --> 01:45:05.024
<v Speaker 1>more so that the conditions of existence</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we normally regard as unjust and </v>

1969
01:45:09.051 --> 01:45:10.080
<v Speaker 1>unfair are.</v>

1970
01:45:14.510 --> 01:45:17.990
<v Speaker 1>But the only way you can find out is if </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a big risk.</v>

1971
01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:19.790
<v Speaker 1>We know what the risk entails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1972
01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:20.893
<v Speaker 1>what we've been trying to figure out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole time is why do people identify </v>

1973
01:45:22.791 --> 01:45:25.010
<v Speaker 1>with groups when there's a big good </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons?</v>

1974
01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:28.550
<v Speaker 1>So helps them regulate their emotions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and protects them from terror.</v>

1975
01:45:29.090 --> 01:45:32.030
<v Speaker 1>So people are well motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can you get me on that?</v>

1976
01:45:33.130 --> 01:45:37.370
<v Speaker 1>That's the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1977
01:45:37.371 --> 01:45:40.700
<v Speaker 1>so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's that for this weekend.</v>
