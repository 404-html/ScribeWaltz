00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:05.703
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was about 18 when I first came to </v>

2
00:00:07.751 --> 00:00:10.360
<v Speaker 1>London.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was the first trip I took to Europe.</v>

3
00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:11.194
<v Speaker 1>I saved up money for a whole year to </v>
<v Speaker 1>travel through Europe for a few months </v>

4
00:00:14.231 --> 00:00:16.120
<v Speaker 1>with some friends of mine was the age of</v>
<v Speaker 1>London.</v>

5
00:00:16.121 --> 00:00:16.954
<v Speaker 1>That really struck me because I'd come </v>
<v Speaker 1>in from western Canada and hadn't </v>

6
00:00:18.941 --> 00:00:21.970
<v Speaker 1>traveled much at that point and of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course western Canada.</v>

7
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.570
<v Speaker 1>The town I grew up in was only </v>
<v Speaker 1>established in the 19 thirties.</v>

8
00:00:25.571 --> 00:00:26.404
<v Speaker 1>Really no one to walk into pubs that had</v>
<v Speaker 1>been around for five or 600 years was </v>

9
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.520
<v Speaker 1>something unheard of in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The magnificence of the architecture and</v>

10
00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:34.354
<v Speaker 1>the fact that things were built to last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The parliament buildings are remarkable </v>

11
00:00:37.421 --> 00:00:40.660
<v Speaker 1>and the castles and the depth of history</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the stability of the country,</v>

12
00:00:40.661 --> 00:00:41.494
<v Speaker 1>all of that and the freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing achievement as far as </v>

13
00:00:44.261 --> 00:00:48.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that we learned in the</v>

14
00:00:48.421 --> 00:00:49.254
<v Speaker 1>west and one of the things that's part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the great English journalistic </v>

15
00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:52.524
<v Speaker 1>tradition is that journalists and </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicted or have the freedom to say </v>

16
00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:56.664
<v Speaker 1>what they want and what they want and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that keeps everyone including the </v>

17
00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:02.220
<v Speaker 1>journalists honest and on track,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we sacrifice that,</v>

18
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.503
<v Speaker 1>especially at the feet of the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>no one is to be oppressed by anything </v>

19
00:01:07.021 --> 00:01:10.020
<v Speaker 1>anyone else says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We sacrifice that at our complete peril.</v>

20
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.500
<v Speaker 1>It's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the cardinal,</v>

21
00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:16.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when people speak freely,</v>

22
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.883
<v Speaker 1>they're able to think and people orient </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in the world by thinking and </v>

23
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:20.964
<v Speaker 1>they re update the state by thinking and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they conquer unknown lands by thinking </v>

24
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.730
<v Speaker 1>and if you put restrictions on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to speak freely,</v>

25
00:01:29.731 --> 00:01:30.564
<v Speaker 1>then you put restrictions on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to think and all of those other </v>

26
00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:36.120
<v Speaker 1>processes grind to a halt and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone suffers for it.</v>

27
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.913
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

28
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.263
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started reading George Orwell when I </v>

29
00:01:41.231 --> 00:01:42.064
<v Speaker 1>was a kid about 13 or 14.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then my read 1984 and animal farm of </v>

30
00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:47.524
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's the books that everyone </v>

31
00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:50.080
<v Speaker 1>starts with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then later in my life,</v>

32
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.263
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I became aware of how prescient George </v>

33
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.060
<v Speaker 1>Orwell was with regards to the dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 1>of totalitarianism.</v>

34
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.913
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the first intellectuals in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the west to sound the alarm about what </v>

35
00:01:59.651 --> 00:02:02.220
<v Speaker 1>was going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the Soviet Union or wells.</v>

36
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.050
<v Speaker 1>Definitely one of my intellectual heroes</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the 20th century.</v>

37
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.273
<v Speaker 1>He's been a hero of mine consistently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Britain holds a special place in the </v>

38
00:02:10.991 --> 00:02:13.750
<v Speaker 1>hearts of Canadians and for good reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

39
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.933
<v Speaker 1>you guys got so many things right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>English common law tradition and the </v>

40
00:02:17.681 --> 00:02:18.514
<v Speaker 1>parliamentary tradition and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been a great gift to everywhere in </v>

41
00:02:22.061 --> 00:02:23.380
<v Speaker 1>the world as far as I'm concerned.</v>
