WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to continue to be with</v>

2
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:08.700
<v Speaker 1>our initial exploration of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways to see the world.</v>

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.490
<v Speaker 1>And so the last time I talked to you a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit about,</v>

4
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.063
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.850
<v Speaker 1>perceptions of what you might describe</v>
<v Speaker 1>as action orientation.</v>

6
00:00:18.851 --> 00:00:21.370
<v Speaker 1>So the case I made for you with</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like this,</v>

7
00:00:21.371 --> 00:00:26.371
<v Speaker 1>that there's two significant patterns of</v>
<v Speaker 1>facts in the sense that you need to know</v>

8
00:00:27.941 --> 00:00:29.880
<v Speaker 1>about the world and one has to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the object,</v>

9
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.920
<v Speaker 1>the reality of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other has to do with how you</v>

10
00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:36.910
<v Speaker 1>configure your behavior in the face of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that objective reality.</v>

11
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.560
<v Speaker 1>And those two overlap to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of what scientists would</v>

12
00:00:41.561 --> 00:00:46.561
<v Speaker 1>normally consider subjective experiences</v>
<v Speaker 1>are part of the domain that is</v>

13
00:00:46.781 --> 00:00:49.330
<v Speaker 1>applicable to how you comport yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>or how you act,</v>

14
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.700
<v Speaker 1>not the moral domain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

15
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.480
<v Speaker 1>because psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in its clinical</v>

16
00:00:55.481 --> 00:00:59.260
<v Speaker 1>manifestations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is concerned with how people should act,</v>

17
00:00:59.261 --> 00:01:01.880
<v Speaker 1>which is in part mental health and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should perceive.</v>

18
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.080
<v Speaker 1>And even experimental psychology to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree is concerned with</v>

19
00:01:05.081 --> 00:01:09.920
<v Speaker 1>psychopathology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's necessary to account for the</v>

20
00:01:09.921 --> 00:01:14.280
<v Speaker 1>subjective and also for values as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>move forward in your investigation of,</v>

21
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.870
<v Speaker 1>of psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality psychology or clinical</v>

22
00:01:16.871 --> 00:01:17.704
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

23
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.193
<v Speaker 2>MMM,</v>

24
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.010
<v Speaker 1>I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

25
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.560
<v Speaker 1>we started last week talking a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit about mythological representations,</v>

26
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think of as the precursor to a</v>

27
00:01:31.281 --> 00:01:35.090
<v Speaker 1>lot of the clinical theories that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to cover today.</v>

28
00:01:35.091 --> 00:01:38.720
<v Speaker 1>I want to go into that in a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>more detail and with a little bit more</v>

29
00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:42.830
<v Speaker 1>specificity because I want to talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you about shamanic initiations and other</v>

30
00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:47.270
<v Speaker 1>rights of initiation because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>appeared to me for a long time and this</v>

31
00:01:47.271 --> 00:01:49.730
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something that has also been</v>

32
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.940
<v Speaker 1>observed by psychoanalytic thinkers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are a</v>

33
00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.880
<v Speaker 1>relevant and important points of</v>
<v Speaker 1>similarity between these archaic rituals</v>

34
00:02:03.261 --> 00:02:05.810
<v Speaker 1>and the sorts of things that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>undergo in psychotherapy.</v>

35
00:02:05.811 --> 00:02:08.480
<v Speaker 1>So I can give you a brief example and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we'll,</v>

36
00:02:08.481 --> 00:02:09.314
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>

37
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.630
<v Speaker 1>we'll consider this in more detail.</v>

38
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.003
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

39
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>People learn almost everything they</v>
<v Speaker 1>learned that's important in the face of</v>

40
00:02:20.011 --> 00:02:23.760
<v Speaker 1>fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And although that's slightly more pests,</v>

41
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.330
<v Speaker 1>pessimistic viewpoint than it might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can optimize that.</v>

42
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.410
<v Speaker 1>The rate at which you expose yourself to</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that would otherwise cause you to</v>

43
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:34.450
<v Speaker 1>be afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they tend just to captivate you</v>

44
00:02:34.451 --> 00:02:36.100
<v Speaker 1>would make you intensely interested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

45
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.570
<v Speaker 1>but as you're progressing through life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing continually as either</v>

46
00:02:41.711 --> 00:02:44.250
<v Speaker 1>at interacting with things that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand well,</v>

47
00:02:44.251 --> 00:02:48.030
<v Speaker 1>which means that you know how to behave</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the face up or your interactions with</v>

48
00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:53.031
<v Speaker 1>things that you don't understand at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your body and your mind are prepared</v>

49
00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:55.560
<v Speaker 1>to respond to things that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand it all.</v>

50
00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.770
<v Speaker 1>And they basically respond by putting</v>
<v Speaker 1>you on alert and being on alert is it</v>

51
00:03:01.101 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 1>signed from your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the deep unconscious recesses of</v>

52
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:10.291
<v Speaker 1>your mind and your body for that matter</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't know what you're doing in</v>

53
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:11.470
<v Speaker 1>this particular space.</v>

54
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.200
<v Speaker 1>And as a consequence you have more</v>
<v Speaker 1>things to learn.</v>

55
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 1>And so the way you learn when you're in</v>
<v Speaker 1>town or something that you don't</v>

56
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:23.161
<v Speaker 1>understand is by progressing voluntarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the space and time that's unknown.</v>

57
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 1>And so you're always learning as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of facing the unknown.</v>

58
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:28.930
<v Speaker 1>And the unknown is something that can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>frightening.</v>

59
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Although it can also be interesting if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

60
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.170
<v Speaker 1>if you calibrate your exposure property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this is just as true for</v>

61
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:38.080
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy as it is for any other</v>
<v Speaker 1>form of learning.</v>

62
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.320
<v Speaker 1>And that's because psychotherapy really</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a form of guided and structured</v>

63
00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:44.680
<v Speaker 1>learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that you continually</v>

64
00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:49.300
<v Speaker 1>do with people who are seeking</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapeutic health is to determine</v>

65
00:03:49.301 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 1>what it is that they're afraid of or</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is that they don't understand.</v>

66
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.860
<v Speaker 1>And then to break it down into what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>might describe as manageable doses and</v>

67
00:03:56.861 --> 00:04:01.120
<v Speaker 1>then get people to expose themselves to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that situation or set of situations</v>

68
00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily.</v>

69
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.120
<v Speaker 1>And the consequence of that is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people become less afraid and more able.</v>

70
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.840
<v Speaker 1>And the original hypothesis was that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you were doing some form of</v>

71
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:14.590
<v Speaker 1>counter conditioning that people have</v>
<v Speaker 1>learned to be afraid in a particular</v>

72
00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:17.470
<v Speaker 1>circumstance and you were teaching them</v>
<v Speaker 1>to not be afraid.</v>

73
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.400
<v Speaker 1>That's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That viewpoint.</v>

74
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.800
<v Speaker 1>What you're really doing with people</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you expose them to situations that</v>

75
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.220
<v Speaker 1>they're afraid of or that they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand is expanding the range of</v>

76
00:04:27.221 --> 00:04:30.100
<v Speaker 1>competence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you either do that by literally</v>

77
00:04:30.101 --> 00:04:32.380
<v Speaker 1>teaching them how to behave in those</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances,</v>

78
00:04:32.381 --> 00:04:37.381
<v Speaker 1>which is what you would do with children</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe with friends or by helping them</v>

79
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.980
<v Speaker 1>observe their own reactions when they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>placed in a situation like that.</v>

80
00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Because lots of people who are afraid of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things think that when they confront</v>

81
00:04:45.941 --> 00:04:49.390
<v Speaker 1>something they're afraid of voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there'll be absolutely terrified</v>

82
00:04:49.391 --> 00:04:52.210
<v Speaker 1>and unable to cope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they often find that if they do</v>

83
00:04:52.211 --> 00:04:55.210
<v Speaker 1>place himself in a situation carefully</v>
<v Speaker 1>and voluntarily,</v>

84
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.930
<v Speaker 1>that they're nowhere near as paralyzed</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the encounter as they might've</v>

85
00:04:58.931 --> 00:04:59.320
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>

86
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.670
<v Speaker 1>And so art and what you're teaching them</v>
<v Speaker 1>then is that there's more to them than</v>

87
00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:05.530
<v Speaker 1>they thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Generally,</v>

88
00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:08.320
<v Speaker 1>when you're teaching people about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

89
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.780
<v Speaker 1>given that the world is a frightening</v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

90
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.620
<v Speaker 1>if you're a psychotherapist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there isn't a lot of utility in trying</v>

91
00:05:14.621 --> 00:05:18.490
<v Speaker 1>to convince people that the world isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>as dangerous as they think because the</v>

92
00:05:18.491 --> 00:05:20.770
<v Speaker 1>world is just as dangerous as you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

93
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.160
<v Speaker 1>It's actually quite a remarkable fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're all not paralyzed with</v>

94
00:05:24.161 --> 00:05:26.590
<v Speaker 1>anxiety all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what we're not.</v>

95
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.700
<v Speaker 1>But part of what you have in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>armament against the terrorism of the</v>

96
00:05:30.701 --> 00:05:35.701
<v Speaker 1>world is the possibility that you hold</v>
<v Speaker 1>within you and people are unbelievably</v>

97
00:05:35.861 --> 00:05:39.070
<v Speaker 1>tough and resourceful creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if you think that you're not up</v>

98
00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:42.280
<v Speaker 1>to the challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be sure that encoded in your</v>

99
00:05:42.281 --> 00:05:45.940
<v Speaker 1>bodily structures somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our abilities that you don't really</v>

100
00:05:45.941 --> 00:05:49.120
<v Speaker 1>understand that would come to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>forefront if you put yourself in a</v>

101
00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:51.730
<v Speaker 1>situation where they were necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

102
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.400
<v Speaker 1>and that's a lot of psychotherapy is</v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely that.</v>

103
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.060
<v Speaker 1>It's helping the person learn that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more to them and they fake not</v>

104
00:05:59.061 --> 00:06:00.890
<v Speaker 1>so much that the world is less</v>
<v Speaker 1>frightening.</v>

105
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.590
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>there</v>

106
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.980
<v Speaker 1>to be exposed to something you're afraid</v>
<v Speaker 1>of often means to reconfigure your own</v>

107
00:06:11.981 --> 00:06:14.620
<v Speaker 1>preconceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're afraid of something,</v>

108
00:06:14.621 --> 00:06:18.460
<v Speaker 1>it usually means that you coded it or</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand it in a certain way.</v>

109
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.880
<v Speaker 1>And so that when you encounter it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only do you have to learn something</v>

110
00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:24.220
<v Speaker 1>new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also have to let go of your old</v>

111
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.840
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's what you do.</v>

112
00:06:25.841 --> 00:06:28.240
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you overcome some kind of prejudice</v>

113
00:06:28.241 --> 00:06:32.410
<v Speaker 1>that you might have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to people or things or places because</v>

114
00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.080
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't approach the,</v>

115
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.420
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the object that you're afraid of in a</v>

116
00:06:37.421 --> 00:06:39.850
<v Speaker 1>conceptual vacuum and you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions.</v>

117
00:06:39.851 --> 00:06:43.120
<v Speaker 1>And what that also applies is that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're learning,</v>

118
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.260
<v Speaker 1>even when you're learning incrementally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a process of letting go and a</v>

119
00:06:47.261 --> 00:06:49.900
<v Speaker 1>process of building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you learn something new,</v>

120
00:06:49.901 --> 00:06:52.390
<v Speaker 1>you have to let go of an old</v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition of some sort.</v>

121
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.560
<v Speaker 1>And those precept positions are alive</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're part of view.</v>

122
00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Part of what that means is that every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every element of learning in the face of</v>

123
00:07:01.901 --> 00:07:06.280
<v Speaker 1>something novel is often also an undoing</v>
<v Speaker 1>of previous learning.</v>

124
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:11.080
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why the Motif of death</v>
<v Speaker 1>and rebirth is such a powerful one</v>

125
00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:12.730
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout human history.</v>

126
00:07:12.731 --> 00:07:15.380
<v Speaker 1>It's a primary motive of human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

127
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.950
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the human story.</v>

128
00:07:17.951 --> 00:07:22.951
<v Speaker 1>It certainly of human mythology and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the experiences that people have in</v>

129
00:07:23.021 --> 00:07:27.940
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy are often similar to death</v>
<v Speaker 1>and rebirth experiences in part because</v>

130
00:07:27.941 --> 00:07:32.941
<v Speaker 1>they come in damaged and fragmented and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt and often have to encounter even</v>

131
00:07:33.491 --> 00:07:37.090
<v Speaker 1>more of the material that caused the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble to begin with.</v>

132
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.950
<v Speaker 1>But the consequence of that is that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can shake the structures that are</v>

133
00:07:41.951 --> 00:07:45.400
<v Speaker 1>inhibiting their further development</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though that might cause some pain</v>

134
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.680
<v Speaker 1>and then hopefully they can come back</v>
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

135
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:52.000
<v Speaker 1>And you know that when you encounter</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's truly unknown,</v>

136
00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.400
<v Speaker 1>you go through a process that's similar</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that too,</v>

137
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:56.770
<v Speaker 1>in that if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

138
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.900
<v Speaker 1>if you've ever been in a situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

139
00:07:58.901 --> 00:08:03.901
<v Speaker 1>where you deeply desired something</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you failed to get it for one reason</v>

140
00:08:04.661 --> 00:08:06.490
<v Speaker 1>or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a tremendous amount of pain</v>

141
00:08:06.491 --> 00:08:08.530
<v Speaker 1>associated with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could be a person or,</v>

142
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.960
<v Speaker 1>or a goal or a dream or something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

143
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:16.480
<v Speaker 1>It's extraordinarily painful not to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to attain a valued goal.</v>

144
00:08:16.481 --> 00:08:21.481
<v Speaker 1>And the failure generally produces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally produces pain.</v>

145
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:22.520
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

146
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.250
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cognitive pain,</v>

147
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.590
<v Speaker 1>but many of the same pathways that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>

148
00:08:26.591 --> 00:08:30.130
<v Speaker 1>And when you have to give up something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you value,</v>

149
00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:34.360
<v Speaker 1>you're giving up a part of yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the part of yourself that's predicated</v>

150
00:08:34.361 --> 00:08:35.890
<v Speaker 1>on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that vision.</v>

151
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.870
<v Speaker 1>And not only is that painful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can really throw you for a loop.</v>

152
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phenomena that we're going to talk</v>

153
00:08:44.711 --> 00:08:46.420
<v Speaker 1>about today are</v>

154
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:53.030
<v Speaker 1>representations of that process as well</v>
<v Speaker 1>as attempts to experiment with because</v>

155
00:08:53.031 --> 00:08:56.850
<v Speaker 1>people have known for a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very long time that there was something</v>

156
00:08:56.851 --> 00:09:01.851
<v Speaker 1>about partial death and rebirth that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>also akin to the revivification of the</v>

157
00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:05.610
<v Speaker 1>human spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's noise that human beings have</v>

158
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:07.590
<v Speaker 1>had for we really don't know how long</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

159
00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:11.130
<v Speaker 1>certainly tens of thousands of years and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be longer than that.</v>

160
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.590
<v Speaker 1>So that's what we're going to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

161
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.540
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm going to back up a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and clarify some of the things that we</v>

162
00:09:18.541 --> 00:09:22.650
<v Speaker 1>talked about in the last class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to give you some sense of why</v>

163
00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:26.710
<v Speaker 1>people see the world the way they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>because as,</v>

164
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.750
<v Speaker 1>as materialistic people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by that I mean people who are</v>

165
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:35.220
<v Speaker 1>embedded in a conceptual world whose</v>
<v Speaker 1>primary presupposition is that?</v>

166
00:09:35.221 --> 00:09:37.680
<v Speaker 1>The fundamental mental level of reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>is material.</v>

167
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.710
<v Speaker 1>We have some misconceptions about our</v>
<v Speaker 1>own perceptions.</v>

168
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.370
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for creatures like us who are alive and</v>

169
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:47.550
<v Speaker 1>who are primates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the objective world isn't the primary</v>

170
00:09:47.551 --> 00:09:51.150
<v Speaker 1>target of our perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The social world is the primary target</v>

171
00:09:51.151 --> 00:09:52.740
<v Speaker 1>of our perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

172
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.370
<v Speaker 1>that's not so surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you examine your own behaviors.</v>

173
00:09:56.371 --> 00:10:00.270
<v Speaker 1>So you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much time do you spend during the</v>

174
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:03.150
<v Speaker 1>day interacting with people in one form</v>
<v Speaker 1>or another?</v>

175
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.980
<v Speaker 1>If you include texting and emailing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>phoning and face to face conversation,</v>

176
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.370
<v Speaker 1>or if you're not interacting with them</v>
<v Speaker 1>directly,</v>

177
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:15.450
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking about them or you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching them or listening to them.</v>

178
00:10:15.451 --> 00:10:16.890
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you're watching them in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

179
00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:19.560
<v Speaker 1>Are you watching them on tv or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to them sing or you're</v>

180
00:10:19.561 --> 00:10:22.170
<v Speaker 1>watching them perform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is,</v>

181
00:10:22.171 --> 00:10:27.171
<v Speaker 1>is that most of the world that confronts</v>
<v Speaker 1>us is the world of other human beings.</v>

182
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:32.940
<v Speaker 1>And the world of other human beings has</v>
<v Speaker 1>been around us evolutionarily ever since</v>

183
00:10:32.941 --> 00:10:36.420
<v Speaker 1>there have been human beings and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to pinpoint.</v>

184
00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:39.570
<v Speaker 1>The precise moment in time in human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings came into existence.</v>

185
00:10:39.571 --> 00:10:43.500
<v Speaker 1>But there were certainly vaguely human</v>
<v Speaker 1>like things 2 million years ago.</v>

186
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.600
<v Speaker 1>We seem to have split from the common</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestors of chimpanzees 7 million years</v>

187
00:10:48.601 --> 00:10:51.750
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's somewhere between two and 7</v>

188
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:55.020
<v Speaker 1>million years that we've been in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment that's primarily made up of</v>

189
00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:57.600
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a great pre history</v>

190
00:10:57.601 --> 00:10:59.610
<v Speaker 1>before that if tens of millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

191
00:10:59.611 --> 00:11:03.990
<v Speaker 1>where are the animals that surrounded us</v>
<v Speaker 1>word precisely human.</v>

192
00:11:03.991 --> 00:11:06.390
<v Speaker 1>But they were certainly social and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were primates.</v>

193
00:11:06.391 --> 00:11:11.391
<v Speaker 1>And so even stretching that back past</v>
<v Speaker 1>far past when we,</v>

194
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.340
<v Speaker 1>we're human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we lived in an environment that was</v>

195
00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:17.340
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally characterized by social</v>
<v Speaker 1>interactions and what that,</v>

196
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:22.260
<v Speaker 1>what that means is that our brain is</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially set up to perceive the world</v>

197
00:11:22.261 --> 00:11:24.510
<v Speaker 1>through a Social Lens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>

198
00:11:24.511 --> 00:11:27.680
<v Speaker 1>here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a quote from a paper on private</v>

199
00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:28.680
<v Speaker 1>social cognition.</v>

200
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.980
<v Speaker 1>How this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a group of researchers are</v>

201
00:11:31.981 --> 00:11:33.840
<v Speaker 1>trying to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

202
00:11:33.841 --> 00:11:37.800
<v Speaker 1>the prodo linguistic representations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think with this paper of baboons,</v>

203
00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:43.010
<v Speaker 1>cause the idea would be before human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our human ancestors have language,</v>

204
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.210
<v Speaker 1>they have the perceptual structures in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conceptual structures that were</v>

205
00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:51.800
<v Speaker 1>linguistic light that that language</v>
<v Speaker 1>emerged out.</v>

206
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:53.183
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

207
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.130
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the understanding that we eventually</v>

208
00:11:57.131 --> 00:11:59.890
<v Speaker 1>trends for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to language was there and it's</v>

209
00:11:59.891 --> 00:12:03.160
<v Speaker 1>prototypical form prior to our ability</v>
<v Speaker 1>to audit.</v>

210
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:06.460
<v Speaker 1>I can give you an example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a funny example.</v>

211
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of you know what to syndrome</v>

212
00:12:09.881 --> 00:12:11.040
<v Speaker 1>is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

213
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:13.240
<v Speaker 1>How many don't?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

214
00:12:13.241 --> 00:12:16.750
<v Speaker 1>Well Tourette's syndrome is a syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's neurological syndrome that's</v>

215
00:12:16.751 --> 00:12:18.820
<v Speaker 1>characterized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oddly enough,</v>

216
00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:22.750
<v Speaker 1>quite the propensity to curse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's very strange because you'd</v>

217
00:12:22.751 --> 00:12:25.120
<v Speaker 1>wonder how in the world with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>neurological condition can make you</v>

218
00:12:25.121 --> 00:12:27.820
<v Speaker 1>curse it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also people with and also move.</v>

219
00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:32.410
<v Speaker 1>They have motor tics and so they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll move in stereotyped fashions</v>

220
00:12:32.411 --> 00:12:32.950
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

221
00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:35.500
<v Speaker 1>and they really can't control that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if they're concentrating on</v>

222
00:12:35.501 --> 00:12:37.750
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can control their motor output.</v>

223
00:12:37.751 --> 00:12:41.320
<v Speaker 1>But if their concentration wanes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they're often possessed by fairly</v>

224
00:12:41.321 --> 00:12:45.970
<v Speaker 1>complicated motor processes that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>run independently of their will as well</v>

225
00:12:45.971 --> 00:12:48.580
<v Speaker 1>as these vocalizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might think,</v>

226
00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:52.240
<v Speaker 1>how in the world could you have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>neurological disorder that would make</v>

227
00:12:52.241 --> 00:12:54.190
<v Speaker 1>you curse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would make you swear?</v>

228
00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:59.760
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't make sense in some sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your brain would be so fractionated</v>

229
00:12:59.771 --> 00:13:04.420
<v Speaker 1>and it's specialization that you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a neurological condition could</v>

230
00:13:04.421 --> 00:13:05.950
<v Speaker 1>emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was that specific.</v>

231
00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.840
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here it seems to be the answer.</v>

232
00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most curse words are very,</v>

233
00:13:10.811 --> 00:13:14.800
<v Speaker 1>very short and kind of guttural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are usually four letters as,</v>

234
00:13:14.801 --> 00:13:18.340
<v Speaker 1>as in the famous four letter word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're also usually expressed</v>

235
00:13:18.341 --> 00:13:20.020
<v Speaker 1>during conditions of high emotion.</v>

236
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.030
<v Speaker 1>Now it turns out that certain kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>primates have distress calls.</v>

237
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.280
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

238
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:32.530
<v Speaker 1>perhaps there's a monkey troop and one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of its primary enemies are,</v>

239
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:34.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory birds that swooped down from</v>

240
00:13:34.661 --> 00:13:38.890
<v Speaker 1>the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the monkeys have evolved a cry</v>

241
00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:42.730
<v Speaker 1>that basically means look out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

242
00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:45.310
<v Speaker 1>there's an eagle in the sky that's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to eat you.</v>

243
00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:49.360
<v Speaker 1>And then once that cry is admitted by</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of any of the group members,</v>

244
00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:52.480
<v Speaker 1>all of them immediately scatter and take</v>
<v Speaker 1>defensive action.</v>

245
00:13:52.481 --> 00:13:54.070
<v Speaker 1>They high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe they have this,</v>

246
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.250
<v Speaker 1>it's another troupe and maybe they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>preyed on by leopards or something like</v>

247
00:13:57.251 --> 00:13:59.470
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they also have an alarm pri for the</v>

248
00:13:59.471 --> 00:14:00.760
<v Speaker 1>leopards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means,</v>

249
00:14:00.761 --> 00:14:02.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit the trees or do whatever you have to</v>

250
00:14:02.591 --> 00:14:04.720
<v Speaker 1>do to get away from the leopard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

251
00:14:04.721 --> 00:14:09.040
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that the linguistic centers</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are in those monkeys that produced</v>

252
00:14:09.041 --> 00:14:11.170
<v Speaker 1>the alarm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ of predators are the same</v>

253
00:14:11.171 --> 00:14:13.000
<v Speaker 1>circuits that you use to curse.</v>

254
00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.260
<v Speaker 1>And if you have tourette syndrome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is it's those old crow</v>

255
00:14:17.261 --> 00:14:21.310
<v Speaker 1>linguistic circuits that you share with</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower order primates that are</v>

256
00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:25.090
<v Speaker 1>disinhibited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can see a good example there</v>

257
00:14:25.091 --> 00:14:30.010
<v Speaker 1>of a pro prototypic language structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>because monkeys are complicated enough</v>

258
00:14:30.011 --> 00:14:31.870
<v Speaker 1>to be able to say something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

259
00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:36.460
<v Speaker 1>there's a Jaguar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's usually the most nervous monkey</v>

260
00:14:36.461 --> 00:14:39.660
<v Speaker 1>in the path who's always jittery ground</v>
<v Speaker 1>on hyper alert,</v>

261
00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.400
<v Speaker 1>who manages to curse out of warranty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

262
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.710
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have this protocol.</v>

263
00:14:44.711 --> 00:14:48.310
<v Speaker 1>Linguistic is underlying prodo</v>
<v Speaker 1>linguistic capability.</v>

264
00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:49.200
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

265
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 1>that's at least part perceptual and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know,</v>

266
00:14:51.981 --> 00:14:53.390
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that primates,</v>

267
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:56.090
<v Speaker 1>and this is true for animals that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>way less sophisticated,</v>

268
00:14:56.091 --> 00:14:59.120
<v Speaker 1>the primates are very good at social</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognition,</v>

269
00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.500
<v Speaker 1>so they know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know to the individual exactly what</v>

270
00:15:03.501 --> 00:15:07.430
<v Speaker 1>strata the other members of their group</v>
<v Speaker 1>occupy can imagine they're in a dominant</v>

271
00:15:07.431 --> 00:15:08.060
<v Speaker 1>Sarky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

272
00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.070
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the,</v>

273
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.980
<v Speaker 1>the talk primates in the bottom primates</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's strategy primates all</v>

274
00:15:12.981 --> 00:15:15.440
<v Speaker 1>the way up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like there is in most animals and</v>

275
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.820
<v Speaker 1>primates are unbelievably good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing who's who and they need to be.</v>

276
00:15:19.821 --> 00:15:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Because if you've messed with the high</v>
<v Speaker 1>order primate up,</v>

277
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.040
<v Speaker 1>the dominants arc and you're sorta</v>
<v Speaker 1>lowly,</v>

278
00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:29.870
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get hurt and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better to be lowly and know your</v>

279
00:15:29.871 --> 00:15:31.880
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least this is how animals manage</v>

280
00:15:31.881 --> 00:15:35.810
<v Speaker 1>it than it is to get hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Young males who are sort of climbing up</v>

281
00:15:35.811 --> 00:15:39.200
<v Speaker 1>the heart hierarchy will often take an</v>
<v Speaker 1>awful lot of abuse trying to get to the,</v>

282
00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:42.890
<v Speaker 1>to the peak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But most animals in his social truth are</v>

283
00:15:42.891 --> 00:15:47.820
<v Speaker 1>pretty much resigned to their locale</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's safer to be there.</v>

284
00:15:47.821 --> 00:15:50.930
<v Speaker 1>And often the casts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

285
00:15:50.931 --> 00:15:53.360
<v Speaker 1>in the primate hierarchy are actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>hereditary.</v>

286
00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:56.470
<v Speaker 1>So generation to generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same family,</v>

287
00:15:56.471 --> 00:15:58.250
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>occupied the same rungs.</v>

288
00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.920
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things we know about</v>
<v Speaker 1>social cognition is that,</v>

289
00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.940
<v Speaker 1>and and human cognition is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it involves social processing</v>

290
00:16:04.941 --> 00:16:07.070
<v Speaker 1>and that it's also very much focused on</v>
<v Speaker 1>status.</v>

291
00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.350
<v Speaker 1>There's some very funny studies of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing.</v>

292
00:16:09.351 --> 00:16:12.020
<v Speaker 1>I think one was done with mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remembered correctly,</v>

293
00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.560
<v Speaker 1>where they'd show me the cacs</v>
<v Speaker 1>photographs of other mechanics from</v>

294
00:16:15.561 --> 00:16:17.720
<v Speaker 1>their troop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those photographs are either have</v>

295
00:16:17.721 --> 00:16:21.890
<v Speaker 1>low status mcats or of high status sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of celebrity mechanics.</v>

296
00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:26.660
<v Speaker 1>And the mechanics would spend much</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer time gazing at the high status</v>

297
00:16:26.661 --> 00:16:29.090
<v Speaker 1>celebrity mechanics than like the low</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

298
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.490
<v Speaker 1>creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever have you that they,</v>

299
00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:33.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had nothing but contempt for.</v>

300
00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:37.400
<v Speaker 1>So you can think a lot of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>preexisting,</v>

301
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.520
<v Speaker 1>perceptual and conceptual categories are</v>
<v Speaker 1>social,</v>

302
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.920
<v Speaker 1>so we're always processing other</v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures.</v>

303
00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Humans for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but other living creatures as well.</v>

304
00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:49.940
<v Speaker 1>And we're also very concerned with who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing what to who and when and who's got</v>

305
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:54.530
<v Speaker 1>the power because it turns out that</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy status for example,</v>

306
00:16:54.531 --> 00:16:57.320
<v Speaker 1>is unbelievably important in</v>
<v Speaker 1>determining,</v>

307
00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.620
<v Speaker 1>well reproductive opportunities in</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>

308
00:17:00.621 --> 00:17:05.621
<v Speaker 1>but also also general health and access</v>
<v Speaker 1>to prime access to resources.</v>

309
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:10.730
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievably important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The internal representations of language</v>

310
00:17:10.731 --> 00:17:13.850
<v Speaker 1>meaning evolve partly from our pre</v>
<v Speaker 1>linguistic ancestor's knowledge of</v>

311
00:17:13.851 --> 00:17:18.410
<v Speaker 1>social relations member and when we tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories or listened to stories,</v>

312
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:22.910
<v Speaker 1>they're always about social relations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all the time like modern monkeys and</v>

313
00:17:22.911 --> 00:17:24.340
<v Speaker 1>apes are ancestors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lived in groups,</v>

314
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:28.310
<v Speaker 1>intricate networks of relationships that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were similar caneously competitive and</v>

315
00:17:28.311 --> 00:17:30.350
<v Speaker 1>cooperative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The demands of social life,</v>

316
00:17:30.351 --> 00:17:33.470
<v Speaker 1>creating selective pressures for just</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of complex,</v>

317
00:17:33.471 --> 00:17:36.470
<v Speaker 1>abstract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptual and computational abilities</v>

318
00:17:36.471 --> 00:17:39.470
<v Speaker 1>that are likely to have proceeded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The earliest forms of linguistic</v>

319
00:17:39.471 --> 00:17:42.920
<v Speaker 1>communication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although baboons have concepts and</v>

320
00:17:42.921 --> 00:17:45.440
<v Speaker 1>acquire propositional information from</v>
<v Speaker 1>other animals,</v>

321
00:17:45.441 --> 00:17:48.560
<v Speaker 1>vocalizations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they cannot articulate this information.</v>

322
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:51.840
<v Speaker 1>They understand dominants relations and</v>
<v Speaker 1>matrilineal kinship,</v>

323
00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.170
<v Speaker 1>but have no words for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This suggests that the internal</v>

324
00:17:55.171 --> 00:17:59.430
<v Speaker 1>representation of Benny concepts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relations and action sequences does not</v>

325
00:17:59.431 --> 00:18:02.760
<v Speaker 1>require language and the language did</v>
<v Speaker 1>not evolve because it was uniquely</v>

326
00:18:02.761 --> 00:18:04.230
<v Speaker 1>suited to representing thought.</v>

327
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

328
00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:10.140
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned to you in the last class</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe the previous class,</v>

329
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:12.330
<v Speaker 1>not only do monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>baboons say,</v>

330
00:18:12.331 --> 00:18:15.360
<v Speaker 1>what's your very complex?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only are they able to track</v>

331
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:19.620
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy structures without</v>
<v Speaker 1>language like the lobsters are able to</v>

332
00:18:19.621 --> 00:18:21.290
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can be very,</v>

333
00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:24.390
<v Speaker 1>you can be very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very sure that the underlying basis for</v>

334
00:18:24.391 --> 00:18:29.391
<v Speaker 1>the linguistic representation of social</v>
<v Speaker 1>interactions is it's deep beyond belief</v>

335
00:18:29.561 --> 00:18:34.050
<v Speaker 1>since we share it with crustaceans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very useful to know this because</v>

336
00:18:34.051 --> 00:18:36.450
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also helps understand why certain</v>

337
00:18:36.451 --> 00:18:38.520
<v Speaker 1>things have to intrinsic meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

338
00:18:38.521 --> 00:18:42.030
<v Speaker 1>like the dominance hierarchy and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>position in the dominants hurricane,</v>

339
00:18:42.031 --> 00:18:46.020
<v Speaker 1>the relative status of preachers isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>intrinsically meaningful piece of</v>

340
00:18:46.021 --> 00:18:50.100
<v Speaker 1>information to us because it's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>important determinant of our survival</v>

341
00:18:50.101 --> 00:18:53.970
<v Speaker 1>and reproductive opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the meeting is there.</v>

342
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.640
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to learn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to figure out what to map</v>

343
00:18:56.641 --> 00:18:59.700
<v Speaker 1>it onto and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means that that kind of meaning</v>

344
00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:03.900
<v Speaker 1>status related meeting is art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's built into you as a,</v>

345
00:19:03.901 --> 00:19:05.970
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the ground of understanding.</v>

346
00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:09.960
<v Speaker 1>So then I'll show you something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully this'll work.</v>

347
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:11.423
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

348
00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:14.280
<v Speaker 2>be a miracle for work.</v>

349
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:16.161
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

350
00:19:16.161 --> 00:19:17.780
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch this.</v>

351
00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:19.923
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

352
00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.600
<v Speaker 1>So we'll watch it one more time.</v>

353
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:39.303
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

354
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anybody willing to hazard a guess</v>

355
00:19:44.971 --> 00:19:46.410
<v Speaker 1>about what was happening there?</v>

356
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:49.063
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

357
00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:50.520
<v Speaker 1>it was an attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

358
00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:52.270
<v Speaker 1>that's one hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

359
00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:53.591
<v Speaker 1>Anyone else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

360
00:19:53.591 --> 00:19:58.270
<v Speaker 1>let's look at the players once again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

361
00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:01.450
<v Speaker 1>so the poor little pink circle is</v>
<v Speaker 1>trapped and then it's trying to get out</v>

362
00:20:01.451 --> 00:20:03.370
<v Speaker 1>and when it does get out the big gray</v>
<v Speaker 1>triangles,</v>

363
00:20:03.371 --> 00:20:05.800
<v Speaker 1>shepherds in the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that irritates the blue triangle,</v>

364
00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:10.090
<v Speaker 1>which he shepherds it back into the box</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the gray triangle isn't able to</v>

365
00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.780
<v Speaker 1>answer something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can tell a story about it.</v>

366
00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:13.870
<v Speaker 1>Does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

367
00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:17.620
<v Speaker 1>like I'm not saying that's the canonical</v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation of the triangles behavior</v>

368
00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.690
<v Speaker 1>or any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you would agree,</v>

369
00:20:19.691 --> 00:20:23.020
<v Speaker 1>I presumed that that's a reasonably</v>
<v Speaker 1>plausible interpretation of what those</v>

370
00:20:23.021 --> 00:20:24.880
<v Speaker 1>triangles and circles were up to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

371
00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:26.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well No,</v>

372
00:20:26.321 --> 00:20:28.060
<v Speaker 1>right cause they're triangles and</v>
<v Speaker 1>circles.</v>

373
00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:31.420
<v Speaker 1>But the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point is,</v>

374
00:20:31.421 --> 00:20:34.810
<v Speaker 1>is that our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our ability to perceive social</v>

375
00:20:34.811 --> 00:20:39.811
<v Speaker 1>interactions is so deep that we can take</v>
<v Speaker 1>entities that are only living in so far</v>

376
00:20:41.231 --> 00:20:44.860
<v Speaker 1>as they're moving in certain ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we immediately attribute like</v>

377
00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:49.540
<v Speaker 1>motivation to tell a little story about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we can also agree on the story.</v>

378
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:52.030
<v Speaker 1>Now you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it was sort of built in by the</v>

379
00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:54.520
<v Speaker 1>people who made the little animated</v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstration but,</v>

380
00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:57.730
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't matter because the point is</v>

381
00:20:57.731 --> 00:20:59.730
<v Speaker 1>they were able to build it in without,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

382
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.560
<v Speaker 1>with virtually no representation</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>

383
00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:06.670
<v Speaker 1>It communicate it because they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they knew that we understand that sort</v>

384
00:21:06.671 --> 00:21:08.230
<v Speaker 1>of information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

385
00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:13.323
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

386
00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.670
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's push our luck and see if this</v>

387
00:21:16.671 --> 00:21:17.504
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

388
00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the basic idea.</v>

389
00:22:51.801 --> 00:22:55.100
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of things that are</v>

390
00:22:55.101 --> 00:22:59.300
<v Speaker 1>interesting about that clip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is everything's animated.</v>

391
00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:02.300
<v Speaker 1>Everything has a life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually okay.</v>

392
00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.490
<v Speaker 1>You can watch that and you understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

393
00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.730
<v Speaker 1>which is quite strange because of course</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally trees don't dance around and</v>

394
00:23:07.731 --> 00:23:08.564
<v Speaker 1>so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

395
00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.540
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

396
00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.520
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this module that we have,</v>

397
00:23:13.521 --> 00:23:15.580
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's badly of describing it because</v>

398
00:23:15.581 --> 00:23:19.290
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more like an entire mode.</v>

399
00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:23.240
<v Speaker 1>It's the entire mode of human perception</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been called the hyperactive agency</v>

400
00:23:23.241 --> 00:23:27.380
<v Speaker 1>detector by people who are somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 1>skeptical about its operation.</v>

401
00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:28.630
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

402
00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:33.170
<v Speaker 1>because we're evolved to exist within</v>
<v Speaker 1>living environments,</v>

403
00:23:33.171 --> 00:23:34.790
<v Speaker 1>it's very living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dynamic,</v>

404
00:23:34.791 --> 00:23:38.840
<v Speaker 1>animal oriented environments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very easy for us to see everything</v>

405
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:41.270
<v Speaker 1>in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is alive,</v>

406
00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:43.970
<v Speaker 1>a priority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why when you're reading</v>

407
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.860
<v Speaker 1>stories to your kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Thomas,</v>

408
00:23:45.861 --> 00:23:47.400
<v Speaker 1>the tank engine has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

409
00:23:47.401 --> 00:23:51.230
<v Speaker 1>what personality and motivations and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>does the little engine that could and</v>

410
00:23:51.231 --> 00:23:52.850
<v Speaker 1>all of these things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

411
00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:57.410
<v Speaker 1>that are used to represent to children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways of interacting in the world.</v>

412
00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.630
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

413
00:23:59.631 --> 00:24:02.960
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point of all this basically is that</v>

414
00:24:02.961 --> 00:24:07.961
<v Speaker 1>we've evolved to categorize the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>into social categories and the social</v>

415
00:24:08.241 --> 00:24:12.440
<v Speaker 1>categories that we use</v>
<v Speaker 1>or that use us.</v>

416
00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:14.450
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a more accurate way of looking at</v>

417
00:24:14.451 --> 00:24:17.090
<v Speaker 1>it because these are tools that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily use.</v>

418
00:24:17.091 --> 00:24:18.910
<v Speaker 1>These are ways that we perceive the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

419
00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.370
<v Speaker 1>They're underneath our understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their preconditions for our</v>

420
00:24:22.371 --> 00:24:27.371
<v Speaker 1>understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we tend to parse up the world into</v>

421
00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:32.860
<v Speaker 1>personified categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't even say that property</v>

422
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:37.210
<v Speaker 1>exactly because that implies that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>projecting something onto the world.</v>

423
00:24:37.211 --> 00:24:39.170
<v Speaker 1>This personification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's deeper than that.</v>

424
00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:44.390
<v Speaker 1>It's that the world appears to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally end up in a,</v>

425
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:48.500
<v Speaker 1>in a living and animated manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because most</v>

426
00:24:48.501 --> 00:24:50.750
<v Speaker 1>of what you process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was certainly the case</v>

427
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:57.430
<v Speaker 1>in to a great degree before human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>became technologically proficient</v>

428
00:24:57.591 --> 00:25:00.410
<v Speaker 1>because we weren't that good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulating the objective world at all.</v>

429
00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:03.410
<v Speaker 1>Everything that we thought about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything we did essentially was</v>

430
00:25:03.411 --> 00:25:07.010
<v Speaker 1>dependent on other creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that also means is that</v>

431
00:25:07.011 --> 00:25:10.550
<v Speaker 1>whatever advances we've made in</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding the objective material</v>

432
00:25:10.551 --> 00:25:15.551
<v Speaker 1>world we've made by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by with a tremendous amount of effort,</v>

433
00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:22.030
<v Speaker 1>removing that tendency to see things in</v>
<v Speaker 1>an animated way from our collective</v>

434
00:25:24.321 --> 00:25:28.280
<v Speaker 1>perception and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and working diligently to come to terms</v>

435
00:25:28.281 --> 00:25:32.570
<v Speaker 1>with the fact that there are ways of</v>
<v Speaker 1>treating certain phenomenon that aren't</v>

436
00:25:32.571 --> 00:25:34.430
<v Speaker 1>animated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that work better.</v>

437
00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:36.080
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult for us.</v>

438
00:25:36.081 --> 00:25:37.670
<v Speaker 1>And that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

439
00:25:37.671 --> 00:25:42.020
<v Speaker 1>we really didn't come up with a science</v>
<v Speaker 1>based technology until about 500 years</v>

440
00:25:42.021 --> 00:25:44.090
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We really had to work against our own</v>

441
00:25:44.091 --> 00:25:47.840
<v Speaker 1>instincts and we still done the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous damage because to the degree</v>

442
00:25:47.841 --> 00:25:51.860
<v Speaker 1>that we now perceive the world as</v>
<v Speaker 1>objective and material and sort of dead</v>

443
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:53.570
<v Speaker 1>in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also,</v>

444
00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:57.200
<v Speaker 1>it's also being deprived of meaning and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people really suffer for that,</v>

445
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:59.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because motor people can certainly say,</v>

446
00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:02.060
<v Speaker 1>given our understanding of both the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of reality,</v>

447
00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.450
<v Speaker 1>is it reasonable to propose that</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything truly has meaning?</v>

448
00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.810
<v Speaker 1>That's a very difficult question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say don't give up on a too,</v>

449
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:10.250
<v Speaker 1>too quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

450
00:26:10.251 --> 00:26:12.830
<v Speaker 1>so here is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's some natural categories of</v>

451
00:26:12.831 --> 00:26:16.520
<v Speaker 1>apprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's the dominants Archi,</v>

452
00:26:16.521 --> 00:26:18.350
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the social group.</v>

453
00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.690
<v Speaker 1>That's actually what union called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>animus.</v>

454
00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Leaping ahead a little bit to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>

455
00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.890
<v Speaker 1>to the young new portion of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

456
00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:26.990
<v Speaker 1>of these lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

457
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.950
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

458
00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:33.370
<v Speaker 1>the dominance hierarchy is basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>what modern social constructionists</v>

459
00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:37.880
<v Speaker 1>called patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's often symbolized by an adult</v>

460
00:26:37.881 --> 00:26:40.400
<v Speaker 1>male.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that can have two aspects,</v>

461
00:26:40.401 --> 00:26:44.430
<v Speaker 1>positive or negative because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the of your culture and you're</v>

462
00:26:44.431 --> 00:26:46.410
<v Speaker 1>also a victim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

463
00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:50.580
<v Speaker 1>It preys on you and pushes on you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shapes you and molds even takes taxes</v>

464
00:26:50.581 --> 00:26:52.860
<v Speaker 1>from you and finds you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't let you do things.</v>

465
00:26:52.861 --> 00:26:55.990
<v Speaker 1>But on another hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here you are in this university and</v>

466
00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:59.250
<v Speaker 1>you're not starving to death and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>all communicate and it's pretty painful.</v>

467
00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:00.570
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

468
00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:03.090
<v Speaker 1>there's the great father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

469
00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:06.240
<v Speaker 1>bifurcated into two elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pause to the negative.</v>

470
00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:10.230
<v Speaker 1>And I told you the other day that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a little cirrus and that's who he</v>

471
00:27:10.231 --> 00:27:14.660
<v Speaker 1>represented for Egyptian mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sorta standing on a pillar and a</v>

472
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.670
<v Speaker 1>representation to the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of an odd Christian</v>

473
00:27:17.671 --> 00:27:19.950
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have gone too far there in the</v>

474
00:27:19.951 --> 00:27:22.680
<v Speaker 1>middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sort of encapsulated inside Mary and</v>

475
00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:27.150
<v Speaker 1>he's holding a figure of Christ and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone in the thing open to say</v>

476
00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:29.810
<v Speaker 1>everyone on the doors to sorta looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at Christ.</v>

477
00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's the father in the middle</v>

478
00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:35.880
<v Speaker 1>there and the father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the middle there is and on this side</v>

479
00:27:35.881 --> 00:27:40.881
<v Speaker 1>you have what's essentially the son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>son and sun at the same time.</v>

480
00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.430
<v Speaker 1>That's horace there and it's priced</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

481
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.520
<v Speaker 1>There's equivalent figures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another religious and puzzled logical</v>

482
00:27:47.521 --> 00:27:50.880
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then on the right you have isis and</v>

483
00:27:50.881 --> 00:27:54.840
<v Speaker 1>isis is related to Mary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in this image because Mary is</v>

484
00:27:54.841 --> 00:27:59.820
<v Speaker 1>basically portrayed there as the mother</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature that incorporates culture,</v>

485
00:27:59.821 --> 00:28:01.170
<v Speaker 1>that's holding the individual.</v>

486
00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:03.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a brilliant representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of them are.</v>

487
00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:08.850
<v Speaker 1>The one on the right is a spectacular</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation because it sums up the</v>

488
00:28:08.851 --> 00:28:13.851
<v Speaker 1>existential situation of human beings in</v>
<v Speaker 1>one sculpture and that is that well all</v>

489
00:28:16.171 --> 00:28:20.160
<v Speaker 1>around us is nature and nature gives and</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes away and nature gives rise to</v>

490
00:28:20.161 --> 00:28:24.180
<v Speaker 1>culture and culture supports us and</v>
<v Speaker 1>while it supports us we suffer and</v>

491
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:28.290
<v Speaker 1>hopefully we suffer and can manage it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why everyone is gazing at the</v>

492
00:28:28.291 --> 00:28:31.260
<v Speaker 1>figure in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's basically accepted the</v>

493
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:35.310
<v Speaker 1>inevitability and necessity of his own</v>
<v Speaker 1>death as a precondition for life.</v>

494
00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:39.420
<v Speaker 1>So it's an amazing representation under</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant,</v>

495
00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:43.200
<v Speaker 1>brilliant work of art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of that west elaboration of these</v>

496
00:28:43.201 --> 00:28:46.290
<v Speaker 1>earlier Egyptian ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's awful lot of similarities</v>

497
00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:48.510
<v Speaker 1>between the mythological representations</v>
<v Speaker 1>of horace,</v>

498
00:28:48.511 --> 00:28:50.340
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of Christ.</v>

499
00:28:50.341 --> 00:28:52.400
<v Speaker 1>Here parallels are many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

500
00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:56.090
<v Speaker 1>that makes people often cynical about</v>
<v Speaker 1>say the claims of Christianity.</v>

501
00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:57.870
<v Speaker 1>But that's foolish as far as I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>

502
00:28:57.871 --> 00:29:01.410
<v Speaker 1>because what both of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>representational systems,</v>

503
00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:06.330
<v Speaker 1>0.2 is something deeper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way deeper way underneath both of them</v>

504
00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:08.460
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself in many forms.</v>

505
00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:09.753
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

506
00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:20.260
<v Speaker 1>so this is the persona fine</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

507
00:29:20.261 --> 00:29:21.770
<v Speaker 1>So Mother Nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>father culture,</v>

508
00:29:21.771 --> 00:29:23.020
<v Speaker 1>and the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

509
00:29:23.021 --> 00:29:26.550
<v Speaker 1>so now imagine that that's sort of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>primary as a crime made.</v>

510
00:29:26.551 --> 00:29:29.170
<v Speaker 1>Who's striving towards linguistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

511
00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:32.110
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of what you've got to work</v>
<v Speaker 1>with as far as you're concerned.</v>

512
00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:35.020
<v Speaker 1>That's the primal structure of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmos.</v>

513
00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:37.180
<v Speaker 1>So there's you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the individual.</v>

514
00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:40.840
<v Speaker 1>There's your mother and nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's your father and culture,</v>

515
00:29:40.841 --> 00:29:42.820
<v Speaker 1>and you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what the rates,</v>

516
00:29:42.821 --> 00:29:44.890
<v Speaker 1>and that's what you've got to work with</v>
<v Speaker 1>to begin with.</v>

517
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:47.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know what?</v>

518
00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:51.490
<v Speaker 1>Evolution is a conservative process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that it's not</v>

519
00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:55.120
<v Speaker 1>a radical renovated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually what evolution does is cobble</v>

520
00:29:55.121 --> 00:29:57.250
<v Speaker 1>something new onto something old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

521
00:29:57.251 --> 00:29:59.080
<v Speaker 1>the oldest conserve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

522
00:29:59.081 --> 00:30:04.081
<v Speaker 1>you have mechanisms way down in your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your neurological systems that enable</v>

523
00:30:04.121 --> 00:30:07.660
<v Speaker 1>you to do things like detects snakes</v>
<v Speaker 1>with an incredible rapidity and jump out</v>

524
00:30:07.661 --> 00:30:08.110
<v Speaker 1>of the way it goes.</v>

525
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:10.090
<v Speaker 1>Or reflexes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same reflexes,</v>

526
00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:13.930
<v Speaker 1>similar reflections that are operative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say when you put your hand on a hot</v>

527
00:30:13.931 --> 00:30:16.240
<v Speaker 1>stove and jerking away before you even</v>
<v Speaker 1>know it's hot.</v>

528
00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:19.540
<v Speaker 1>So the reason you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason you can do that is because</v>

529
00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:24.690
<v Speaker 1>your body has conserved incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>primitive neurological loops say will be</v>

530
00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:28.690
<v Speaker 1>jerk your hand away from the stove that</v>
<v Speaker 1>only run from your hand to your spinal</v>

531
00:30:28.691 --> 00:30:30.940
<v Speaker 1>cord and back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're super fast,</v>

532
00:30:30.941 --> 00:30:32.560
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't do much.</v>

533
00:30:32.561 --> 00:30:33.970
<v Speaker 1>They can jerk your hand away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

534
00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:35.500
<v Speaker 1>which is enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's burning,</v>

535
00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.420
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's a good thing to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>conserved.</v>

536
00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:43.020
<v Speaker 1>So human beings as they evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitively started out with this social</v>

537
00:30:43.661 --> 00:30:47.590
<v Speaker 1>cognitive architecture that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they interpreted the world through.</v>

538
00:30:47.591 --> 00:30:49.600
<v Speaker 1>And you can see why this would be partly</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

539
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:52.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do live in intensely social</v>

540
00:30:52.151 --> 00:30:54.280
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always been mothers,</v>

541
00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:55.670
<v Speaker 1>there's always been farther.</v>

542
00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:59.890
<v Speaker 1>And then you add to that the human fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have this unbelievably long</v>

543
00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.930
<v Speaker 1>developmental period where we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>incapable,</v>

544
00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.220
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally and capable of taking care</v>
<v Speaker 1>of ourselves.</v>

545
00:31:06.221 --> 00:31:07.180
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

546
00:31:07.181 --> 00:31:09.910
<v Speaker 1>when something like that a moose calf is</v>
<v Speaker 1>born,</v>

547
00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:13.330
<v Speaker 1>it's like three minutes later it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>wandering around in a full shows up.</v>

548
00:31:13.331 --> 00:31:13.791
<v Speaker 1>Can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

549
00:31:13.791 --> 00:31:17.440
<v Speaker 1>it can run beside it's mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like human baby just lays there for</v>

550
00:31:17.441 --> 00:31:19.570
<v Speaker 1>like a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

551
00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:22.030
<v Speaker 1>And part of that is because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may not know this,</v>

552
00:31:22.031 --> 00:31:25.750
<v Speaker 1>but for a mammal of our size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should have a gestation period of two</v>

553
00:31:25.751 --> 00:31:29.290
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when those of you who are women have</v>

554
00:31:29.291 --> 00:31:32.800
<v Speaker 1>children in the future and you know at</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine months you're pretty damn sick of</v>

555
00:31:32.801 --> 00:31:36.130
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might well thank the structure of</v>

556
00:31:36.131 --> 00:31:38.290
<v Speaker 1>the cosmos that you don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

557
00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:42.850
<v Speaker 1>15 more months to go because that's how</v>
<v Speaker 1>long the baby should remain in utero.</v>

558
00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:46.480
<v Speaker 1>The reason it doesn't is because its</v>
<v Speaker 1>head grows too fast because we have this</v>

559
00:31:46.481 --> 00:31:50.170
<v Speaker 1>big brain and so there's this weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary arms race between the</v>

560
00:31:50.171 --> 00:31:53.890
<v Speaker 1>mother's body and the pelvic girdle and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the head size of the infant.</v>

561
00:31:53.891 --> 00:31:58.150
<v Speaker 1>And the way that's all sorted itself out</v>
<v Speaker 1>is women's hips are still narrow enough</v>

562
00:31:58.151 --> 00:32:00.490
<v Speaker 1>so they could run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause if they were any wider,</v>

563
00:32:00.491 --> 00:32:05.260
<v Speaker 1>they'd have a hard time running and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby is born at nine months instead of</v>

564
00:32:05.261 --> 00:32:09.700
<v Speaker 1>24 with the compressible head because</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby's skull bones aren't put together.</v>

565
00:32:09.701 --> 00:32:11.830
<v Speaker 1>And so when they pass through the birth</v>
<v Speaker 1>canal,</v>

566
00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.590
<v Speaker 1>their head can be crushed and quite a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot so that,</v>

567
00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:16.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully they live.</v>

568
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:21.520
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have this incredible period of</v>

569
00:32:21.521 --> 00:32:25.090
<v Speaker 1>dependency after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's abject dependency for the first</v>

570
00:32:25.091 --> 00:32:26.650
<v Speaker 1>while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you're really not,</v>

571
00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:30.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how long it takes people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>really get up and going.</v>

572
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:32.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well 18 we'll say,</v>

573
00:32:32.651 --> 00:32:36.640
<v Speaker 1>but of course that's complete rubbish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more like 30 so there's a very long</v>

574
00:32:36.641 --> 00:32:40.820
<v Speaker 1>dependency period and so that's all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>more reason why we would tend to view</v>

575
00:32:40.821 --> 00:32:42.690
<v Speaker 1>the world as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>

576
00:32:42.691 --> 00:32:46.640
<v Speaker 1>her father and then expand that owns</v>
<v Speaker 1>into our conception of the cosmos and</v>

577
00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:51.650
<v Speaker 1>cure here seems to be how people did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's complicated association to</v>

578
00:32:52.281 --> 00:32:54.890
<v Speaker 1>manage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think the best way of managing it</v>

579
00:32:54.891 --> 00:32:57.740
<v Speaker 1>is to think of the figure of Mother</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nature and that that would be narrow</v>

580
00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:59.690
<v Speaker 1>here with the Isis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're now,</v>

581
00:32:59.691 --> 00:33:03.770
<v Speaker 1>nature is a funny thing because I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want you to think about nature of the</v>

582
00:33:03.771 --> 00:33:06.110
<v Speaker 1>way that modern people think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

583
00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:10.640
<v Speaker 1>I want you to think about nature as that</v>
<v Speaker 1>which lurks outside of culture.</v>

584
00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:16.420
<v Speaker 1>So imagining the typical</v>
<v Speaker 1>tribal scene or let's say in the typical</v>

585
00:33:16.581 --> 00:33:21.581
<v Speaker 1>rather primeval a village or gathering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a domain that people inhabit</v>

586
00:33:22.161 --> 00:33:23.870
<v Speaker 1>that they're sort of comfortable with.</v>

587
00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:27.140
<v Speaker 1>That's where all the people are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where the dominance hierarchy is.</v>

588
00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:30.460
<v Speaker 1>And then that sort of surrounded by God</v>
<v Speaker 1>only knows what,</v>

589
00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:33.800
<v Speaker 1>like the outside world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the barbarians,</v>

590
00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:37.130
<v Speaker 1>the darkness that eats the sun when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes down at night,</v>

591
00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:41.750
<v Speaker 1>all the things that are foreign and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable or outside of that circle.</v>

592
00:33:41.751 --> 00:33:45.440
<v Speaker 1>And that's nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's outside of culture is nature.</v>

593
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:49.340
<v Speaker 1>And so nature is the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what's inside is culture.</v>

594
00:33:49.341 --> 00:33:52.760
<v Speaker 1>That's the known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually turns out to be</v>

595
00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:55.490
<v Speaker 1>weirdly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's a worldview that's</v>

596
00:33:55.491 --> 00:33:58.280
<v Speaker 1>predicated on its underlying social</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive structure,</v>

597
00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:02.750
<v Speaker 1>it turns out to be a worldview that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably useful because it happens</v>

598
00:34:02.751 --> 00:34:07.250
<v Speaker 1>to map onto the structure of subjective</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience extremely well in that</v>

599
00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:12.560
<v Speaker 1>wherever you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're viewing the world through a</v>

600
00:34:12.561 --> 00:34:16.250
<v Speaker 1>cultural lens and you're usually</v>
<v Speaker 1>encapsulated in a culture as well.</v>

601
00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.790
<v Speaker 1>You virtually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's virtually impossible now to go</v>

602
00:34:19.791 --> 00:34:22.520
<v Speaker 1>anywhere where culture isn't with you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and around you.</v>

603
00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:26.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can do it from time to time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even if you manage that,</v>

604
00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:28.480
<v Speaker 1>it's still inside you in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

605
00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:29.320
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

606
00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.153
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

607
00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:33.950
<v Speaker 1>it's coated in the way that you behave</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's structured the way you perceive</v>

608
00:34:33.951 --> 00:34:38.240
<v Speaker 1>things and think about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even if the outside world is devoid</v>

609
00:34:38.241 --> 00:34:40.610
<v Speaker 1>of cultural artifacts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter cause you're a cultural</v>

610
00:34:40.611 --> 00:34:43.520
<v Speaker 1>artifact right to your court.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Despite that.</v>

611
00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:47.540
<v Speaker 1>And it's the incorporation of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture that allows you to maneuver and</v>

612
00:34:47.541 --> 00:34:50.090
<v Speaker 1>live and act and do that somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 1>successfully.</v>

613
00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Despite that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite that you're enculturated and</v>

614
00:34:54.051 --> 00:34:58.070
<v Speaker 1>embedded in culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nature can pop up and disturb you pretty</v>

615
00:34:58.071 --> 00:35:01.430
<v Speaker 1>much at any moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that happens when whatever it is</v>

616
00:35:01.431 --> 00:35:06.431
<v Speaker 1>that you're doing doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the way that that humanity</v>

617
00:35:07.611 --> 00:35:12.611
<v Speaker 1>naturally perceives the world and</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolizes the world is as a place</v>

618
00:35:12.651 --> 00:35:16.730
<v Speaker 1>that's basically composed of culture and</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture is where you are when things are</v>

619
00:35:16.731 --> 00:35:19.400
<v Speaker 1>going according to how you want them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

620
00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:21.860
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of the definition of</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing,</v>

621
00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:22.921
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

622
00:35:22.921 --> 00:35:26.540
<v Speaker 1>it's not knowing a set of facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's knowing how to behave so that the</v>

623
00:35:26.541 --> 00:35:30.950
<v Speaker 1>ends that you're pursuing get acquired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's more important in many ways</v>

624
00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:35.210
<v Speaker 1>that knowing facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facts may help you do that.</v>

625
00:35:35.211 --> 00:35:36.470
<v Speaker 1>But they been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they may not too.</v>

626
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.220
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

627
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:40.740
<v Speaker 1>there's the place you are when you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing and you get what you</v>

628
00:35:40.741 --> 00:35:43.650
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's that other place that</v>

629
00:35:43.651 --> 00:35:47.160
<v Speaker 1>parks up all the time where you haven't</v>
<v Speaker 1>got a clue about what to do.</v>

630
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:51.630
<v Speaker 1>And that's the place that it's like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent place and that's nature.</v>

631
00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:54.900
<v Speaker 1>And the Trans seven places where all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mysteries of life comes from,</v>

632
00:35:54.901 --> 00:35:57.390
<v Speaker 1>the things that you cannot handle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the diseases,</v>

633
00:35:57.391 --> 00:35:58.710
<v Speaker 1>the illnesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dad,</v>

634
00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:00.840
<v Speaker 1>disappointments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frustrations,</v>

635
00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:04.710
<v Speaker 1>all the things that knock you for a loop</v>
<v Speaker 1>and make you tumble underground.</v>

636
00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:06.090
<v Speaker 1>And that's nature.</v>

637
00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a predator.</v>

638
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:12.150
<v Speaker 1>And it's a strange place nature because</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the one hand it gives,</v>

639
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.640
<v Speaker 1>because nature is the source of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

640
00:36:14.641 --> 00:36:16.350
<v Speaker 1>given that it's the source of all new</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

641
00:36:16.351 --> 00:36:20.310
<v Speaker 1>but on other hand it takes away because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it surrounds you if,</v>

642
00:36:20.311 --> 00:36:22.610
<v Speaker 1>because it transcends your knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's eventually what,</v>

643
00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:26.400
<v Speaker 1>what kills you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people have a very ambivalent</v>

644
00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:31.580
<v Speaker 1>relationship with nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andy and Andy with nature because of</v>

645
00:36:32.461 --> 00:36:36.120
<v Speaker 1>it's because of it's bifurcated and</v>
<v Speaker 1>paradoxical</v>

646
00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:39.780
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Culture's the same way.</v>

647
00:36:39.781 --> 00:36:42.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean in formal logic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thing can't be one thing and it's</v>

648
00:36:42.961 --> 00:36:46.500
<v Speaker 1>opposite at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these mythological categories that</v>

649
00:36:46.501 --> 00:36:49.830
<v Speaker 1>are derivatives of social cognition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are what they are in their</v>

650
00:36:49.831 --> 00:36:53.190
<v Speaker 1>opposites at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as you're a beneficiary or a victim</v>

651
00:36:53.191 --> 00:36:56.370
<v Speaker 1>of culture and a beneficiary and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>victim of nature.</v>

652
00:36:57.090 --> 00:37:01.290
<v Speaker 1>So now the reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason I'm telling you this</v>

653
00:37:01.291 --> 00:37:04.920
<v Speaker 1>is because it's very complicated to</v>
<v Speaker 1>grasp,</v>

654
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:07.950
<v Speaker 1>but what's what's happened with you</v>
<v Speaker 1>neurologically in part?</v>

655
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:12.540
<v Speaker 1>Is that the part of your brain that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved to deal with things like</v>

656
00:37:12.541 --> 00:37:14.580
<v Speaker 1>predators and dangers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

657
00:37:14.581 --> 00:37:18.780
<v Speaker 1>things that are emanating from nature</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would directly threatened you once</v>

658
00:37:18.781 --> 00:37:22.020
<v Speaker 1>those things became abstracted so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could handle,</v>

659
00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:26.250
<v Speaker 1>became sophisticated enough so that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can handle abstractions instead of</v>

660
00:37:26.251 --> 00:37:28.740
<v Speaker 1>dealing with things like Predator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

661
00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Predator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>b or Predator,</v>

662
00:37:29.951 --> 00:37:31.920
<v Speaker 1>see your dangerous situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

663
00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:35.520
<v Speaker 1>they got sophisticated enough to deal</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the class of those things.</v>

664
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.020
<v Speaker 1>And so human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of perceiving a dangerous animal</v>

665
00:37:40.021 --> 00:37:43.860
<v Speaker 1>or a dangerous place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started to be able to perceive danger as</v>

666
00:37:43.861 --> 00:37:47.790
<v Speaker 1>such and to conceptualize danger as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>class of events.</v>

667
00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:51.600
<v Speaker 1>But the same circuits that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>originate that originated to do things</v>

668
00:37:51.601 --> 00:37:52.920
<v Speaker 1>like take care of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

669
00:37:52.921 --> 00:37:55.920
<v Speaker 1>to make sure that you knew where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes were coming from are also the</v>

670
00:37:55.921 --> 00:38:00.921
<v Speaker 1>circuits that now enable you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize danger in the abstract and</v>

671
00:38:01.021 --> 00:38:01.771
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

672
00:38:01.771 --> 00:38:05.160
<v Speaker 1>to deal with it one way or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Potential future danger,</v>

673
00:38:05.161 --> 00:38:08.460
<v Speaker 1>danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the fact of danger as an existential</v>

674
00:38:08.461 --> 00:38:11.220
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that only human beings can</v>

675
00:38:11.221 --> 00:38:16.221
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize the class of all dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 1>things and part of that's associated</v>

676
00:38:17.191 --> 00:38:18.024
<v Speaker 1>with nature.</v>

677
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:19.783
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

678
00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.670
<v Speaker 1>so there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the domain of nature outside the</v>

679
00:38:26.671 --> 00:38:28.830
<v Speaker 1>domain of culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like an ocean surrounding an</v>

680
00:38:28.831 --> 00:38:30.990
<v Speaker 1>island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's you standing on an</v>

681
00:38:30.991 --> 00:38:34.740
<v Speaker 1>island islands nice and secure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very standard mythological</v>

682
00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:37.110
<v Speaker 1>representation of the cause was by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

683
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:40.900
<v Speaker 1>there's culture and there's nature and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's you,</v>

684
00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:45.070
<v Speaker 1>and that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the architectural situation of</v>

685
00:38:45.071 --> 00:38:48.220
<v Speaker 1>the human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's essentially our reality.</v>

686
00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.100
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a reality.</v>

687
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:54.500
<v Speaker 1>It's not merely objected because it's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>tied up with life and with other people</v>

688
00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:59.610
<v Speaker 1>and with their own essential being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here are some,</v>

689
00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:04.150
<v Speaker 1>now we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can move from the sort of underlying</v>

690
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:07.120
<v Speaker 1>domains of nature of the unknown</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

691
00:39:07.121 --> 00:39:09.760
<v Speaker 1>the known and the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we can start to put some</v>

692
00:39:09.761 --> 00:39:14.140
<v Speaker 1>symbolic flesh on those bones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this'll help us when we get into</v>

693
00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:18.190
<v Speaker 1>discussions of psychoanalytic theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the analytical psychologists</v>

694
00:39:18.191 --> 00:39:20.980
<v Speaker 1>like yoga and the psychoanalysts like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud was very,</v>

695
00:39:20.981 --> 00:39:24.700
<v Speaker 1>very interested in the images that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>produced by what they regarded as the</v>

696
00:39:24.701 --> 00:39:25.630
<v Speaker 1>unconscious mind.</v>

697
00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:30.160
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your most direct contact with those</v>

698
00:39:30.161 --> 00:39:32.260
<v Speaker 1>sorts of images would come from two</v>
<v Speaker 1>sources.</v>

699
00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:36.160
<v Speaker 1>One would be your dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other would be the stories that</v>

700
00:39:36.161 --> 00:39:39.010
<v Speaker 1>you're exposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both ancient and new,</v>

701
00:39:39.011 --> 00:39:41.770
<v Speaker 1>because those stories are full of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological motifs.</v>

702
00:39:41.771 --> 00:39:43.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very weird.</v>

703
00:39:43.241 --> 00:39:44.950
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in recent years,</v>

704
00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:49.510
<v Speaker 1>the most expensive artifacts that human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings produce virtually maybe with the</v>

705
00:39:49.511 --> 00:39:54.280
<v Speaker 1>exception of plants that fabricate chips</v>
<v Speaker 1>are movies,</v>

706
00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:57.160
<v Speaker 1>visual representations of mythological</v>
<v Speaker 1>themes.</v>

707
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:59.530
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the marvel movies,</v>

708
00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:02.110
<v Speaker 1>iron man and those sorts of movies in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the avenger,</v>

709
00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:05.440
<v Speaker 1>those are among the most expensive</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that people have ever created.</v>

710
00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:07.001
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say,</v>

711
00:40:07.001 --> 00:40:09.460
<v Speaker 1>well there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's obviously a profit motive</v>

712
00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:10.570
<v Speaker 1>underlying that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

713
00:40:10.571 --> 00:40:11.320
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

714
00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:14.110
<v Speaker 1>it's not a very intelligent analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is,</v>

715
00:40:14.111 --> 00:40:17.890
<v Speaker 1>is that people are still devoting a</v>
<v Speaker 1>staggering amount of effort to</v>

716
00:40:17.891 --> 00:40:20.740
<v Speaker 1>representations like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody goes and watches the,</v>

717
00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:23.320
<v Speaker 1>so just for an example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

718
00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the avengers movie,</v>

719
00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:28.540
<v Speaker 1>there's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can name half a dozen mythological</v>

720
00:40:28.541 --> 00:40:31.210
<v Speaker 1>motifs that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are embedded in that.</v>

721
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:35.340
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>iron man is nell chemical symbol cause</v>

722
00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:38.200
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's turning into gold and iron turns</v>

723
00:40:38.201 --> 00:40:41.380
<v Speaker 1>into gold as far as the agent alchemists</v>
<v Speaker 1>are concerned.</v>

724
00:40:41.381 --> 00:40:44.110
<v Speaker 1>That's part of its moral progression</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards perfection.</v>

725
00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:47.870
<v Speaker 1>And his suit represents that cause it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>gold even though he's in the iron man,</v>

726
00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:49.870
<v Speaker 1>he's also ICARUS,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

727
00:40:49.871 --> 00:40:52.720
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ICARUS flies too close to the sun and</v>

728
00:40:52.721 --> 00:40:54.430
<v Speaker 1>then plummets to earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So of course,</v>

729
00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>iron man does that when he's in</v>

730
00:40:56.551 --> 00:41:01.300
<v Speaker 1>countering the thermonuclear explosion</v>
<v Speaker 1>that eventually wipes out the,</v>

731
00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:03.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the demonic aliens that are pouring</v>

732
00:41:03.911 --> 00:41:05.950
<v Speaker 1>through the portal in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in time.</v>

733
00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:09.960
<v Speaker 1>So in the thor movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a hostile brothers motifs.</v>

734
00:41:09.961 --> 00:41:12.670
<v Speaker 1>So there's thor and Loki that's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>kate enable or Christ.</v>

735
00:41:12.671 --> 00:41:16.690
<v Speaker 1>And Satan's the same motif and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>representative of the sort of eternal</v>

736
00:41:16.691 --> 00:41:21.691
<v Speaker 1>battle between good and even evil that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in the background of human</v>

737
00:41:21.791 --> 00:41:24.340
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and like it's on and on</v>
<v Speaker 1>and on.</v>

738
00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:29.370
<v Speaker 1>These movies portray these symbolic</v>
<v Speaker 1>realities for us and we're so hungry for</v>

739
00:41:30.581 --> 00:41:32.980
<v Speaker 1>them that will line up and pay to watch</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

740
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:35.210
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

741
00:41:35.211 --> 00:41:37.910
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not many forms of activity that</v>

742
00:41:37.911 --> 00:41:39.620
<v Speaker 1>you will do that for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

743
00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.750
<v Speaker 1>and they're very informative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those movies.</v>

744
00:41:41.751 --> 00:41:43.850
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't generally line up and pay for</v>

745
00:41:43.851 --> 00:41:45.350
<v Speaker 1>lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>

746
00:41:45.351 --> 00:41:46.880
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll go to those for fun.</v>

747
00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:49.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very strange behavior,</v>

748
00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:52.650
<v Speaker 1>especially when you look at what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are represented.</v>

749
00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:56.000
<v Speaker 1>Everything that Medieval Christians for</v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

750
00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:00.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got exposed to in the Catholic Church</v>

751
00:42:00.141 --> 00:42:01.670
<v Speaker 1>and in the mythology that went along</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>

752
00:42:01.671 --> 00:42:05.560
<v Speaker 1>We go to movies and see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the movies set up the same way at</v>

753
00:42:05.561 --> 00:42:06.251
<v Speaker 1>churches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

754
00:42:06.251 --> 00:42:11.210
<v Speaker 1>There's seed rows and rows of seats and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a mythological actions at the</v>

755
00:42:11.211 --> 00:42:15.020
<v Speaker 1>front and it's bright and there's music</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's exactly the same thing.</v>

756
00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:20.320
<v Speaker 1>So here's some symbolic equivalents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason you might think of a</v>

757
00:42:20.781 --> 00:42:23.210
<v Speaker 1>symbol as something that represents</v>
<v Speaker 1>something else,</v>

758
00:42:23.211 --> 00:42:25.950
<v Speaker 1>but that's not exactly the right way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>

759
00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:30.800
<v Speaker 1>These symbols in this sense are elements</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this domain.</v>

760
00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:34.520
<v Speaker 1>So they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the domain encompasses a tremendous</v>

761
00:42:34.521 --> 00:42:37.460
<v Speaker 1>number of phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these are some of the phenomena.</v>

762
00:42:37.461 --> 00:42:40.640
<v Speaker 1>So there's nature nature's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>

763
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:41.331
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

764
00:42:41.331 --> 00:42:43.790
<v Speaker 1>it's beyond you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your unconscious mind.</v>

765
00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:46.280
<v Speaker 1>That's not you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's nature inside you.</v>

766
00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:48.890
<v Speaker 1>It does what it wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll do all sorts of things.</v>

767
00:42:48.891 --> 00:42:51.200
<v Speaker 1>You don't want it to want what don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want it to do,</v>

768
00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:53.000
<v Speaker 1>and there isn't much you can do about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

769
00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:56.150
<v Speaker 1>And all you have to do is notice all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid things you've done in the last</v>

770
00:42:56.151 --> 00:43:00.140
<v Speaker 1>six months to understand to what degree</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the grip of the unconscious.</v>

771
00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:02.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you fall in love with someone and</v>

772
00:43:02.661 --> 00:43:03.920
<v Speaker 1>you don't even like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

773
00:43:03.921 --> 00:43:05.150
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is up with that?</v>

774
00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:09.140
<v Speaker 1>And there's nothing you can do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll act like a moron.</v>

775
00:43:09.141 --> 00:43:11.420
<v Speaker 1>Just like everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every human being who's ever lived,</v>

776
00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:13.670
<v Speaker 1>acted like a moron when that happen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

777
00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:17.570
<v Speaker 1>So you're gripped by the darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nature too.</v>

778
00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:21.890
<v Speaker 1>That's what lurks outside the campfire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the terrible things that prey</v>

779
00:43:21.891 --> 00:43:25.730
<v Speaker 1>on the unwary and of course that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's not just symbolic.</v>

780
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:29.720
<v Speaker 1>He's things aren't just symbolic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are monsters.</v>

781
00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:32.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents will tell their children when</v>

782
00:43:32.061 --> 00:43:33.680
<v Speaker 1>they have a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while there's no such thing as a</v>

783
00:43:33.681 --> 00:43:34.431
<v Speaker 1>monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

784
00:43:34.431 --> 00:43:36.800
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they'll tell them not to ever</v>

785
00:43:36.801 --> 00:43:39.980
<v Speaker 1>approach a stranger on the street</v>
<v Speaker 1>because God only knows what will happen.</v>

786
00:43:39.981 --> 00:43:43.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like those two things do not go</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

787
00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:45.530
<v Speaker 1>They're either monsters are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there aren't.</v>

788
00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:48.110
<v Speaker 1>People are so damn afraid of them still</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>

789
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:49.980
<v Speaker 1>they torture their children to death</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

790
00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:52.520
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with threats,</v>

791
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:55.250
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the idea of threats that don't even</v>

792
00:43:55.251 --> 00:43:57.160
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the probability that a given</v>

793
00:43:57.170 --> 00:44:01.420
<v Speaker 1>challenge could be abducted by a</v>
<v Speaker 1>stranger is so close to zero that you</v>

794
00:44:01.421 --> 00:44:02.870
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might as well not even bother</v>

795
00:44:02.871 --> 00:44:05.440
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost always a,</v>

796
00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:07.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a divorced parent that comes along and</v>

797
00:44:07.641 --> 00:44:10.890
<v Speaker 1>grabs them and runs off with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

798
00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:13.350
<v Speaker 1>well it's a custody if it's a custody</v>
<v Speaker 1>dispute issue.</v>

799
00:44:13.351 --> 00:44:15.560
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hardly anybody gets abducted by</v>

800
00:44:15.561 --> 00:44:17.510
<v Speaker 1>strangers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would they want your child?</v>

801
00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:24.740
<v Speaker 1>Nature has dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This other element too,</v>

802
00:44:24.741 --> 00:44:26.630
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you sort of hear about it at a</v>

803
00:44:26.631 --> 00:44:29.630
<v Speaker 1>funeral where its ashes to ashes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dust to dust,</v>

804
00:44:29.631 --> 00:44:31.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nature is the thing you emerge out of</v>

805
00:44:31.441 --> 00:44:33.480
<v Speaker 1>like poof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there you are.</v>

806
00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:38.370
<v Speaker 1>You're born and you weren't around</v>
<v Speaker 1>before and then you know 50 60 70 years</v>

807
00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:40.680
<v Speaker 1>give or take a decade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going again.</v>

808
00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:43.020
<v Speaker 1>What did you come out of and where do</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go?</v>

809
00:44:43.021 --> 00:44:45.420
<v Speaker 1>Well that's nature from a symbolic</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective too.</v>

810
00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:48.750
<v Speaker 1>It's out of nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You come in back to nothing.</v>

811
00:44:48.751 --> 00:44:52.170
<v Speaker 1>You go and it makes absolutely no sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter because that's</v>

812
00:44:52.171 --> 00:44:56.280
<v Speaker 1>what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that sort of nature as as the</v>

813
00:44:56.281 --> 00:45:00.120
<v Speaker 1>unconscious and the devour and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the great mother,</v>

814
00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:01.740
<v Speaker 1>the Queen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Matrix,</v>

815
00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:04.050
<v Speaker 1>the matrix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the container,</v>

816
00:45:04.051 --> 00:45:06.270
<v Speaker 1>the Cornucopia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what a Cornucopia is.</v>

817
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:08.340
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those things that you see at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanksgiving.</v>

818
00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:10.650
<v Speaker 1>We're thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got this point at one end and it</v>

819
00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:14.070
<v Speaker 1>opens up into a kind of a big circle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a horn.</v>

820
00:45:14.071 --> 00:45:16.470
<v Speaker 1>It's made out of wicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And things pour out of it.</v>

821
00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:19.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like what is that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

822
00:45:19.381 --> 00:45:19.861
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

823
00:45:19.861 --> 00:45:22.080
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a Cornucopia and it's a,</v>

824
00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:27.000
<v Speaker 1>it's a representation of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the portal in a sense that everything</v>

825
00:45:27.001 --> 00:45:29.370
<v Speaker 1>flows out of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can think about it in some ways.</v>

826
00:45:29.371 --> 00:45:32.250
<v Speaker 1>You ever watch those time lapse</v>
<v Speaker 1>photographs of a flower opening?</v>

827
00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Of course he have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how it sort of comes out of</v>

828
00:45:34.291 --> 00:45:37.860
<v Speaker 1>nowhere and manifests itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the Cornucopia is a</v>

829
00:45:37.861 --> 00:45:42.210
<v Speaker 1>representation of the place from which</v>
<v Speaker 1>all new forms constantly emerge.</v>

830
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:45.060
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you're supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>thankful for it Thanksgiving and you</v>

831
00:45:45.061 --> 00:45:48.870
<v Speaker 1>should be thankful for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a pretty be a pretty dismal world</v>

832
00:45:48.871 --> 00:45:51.570
<v Speaker 1>effects start happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's this,</v>

833
00:45:51.571 --> 00:45:54.600
<v Speaker 1>the object to be fertilized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the source of all things that he come to</v>

834
00:45:54.601 --> 00:45:55.500
<v Speaker 1>the pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

835
00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:58.830
<v Speaker 1>that kind of helps explain why the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

836
00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:03.270
<v Speaker 1>it's the representation of the feminine</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was used to represent the unknown</v>

837
00:46:03.271 --> 00:46:07.740
<v Speaker 1>because I'm now known as the place that</v>
<v Speaker 1>all new forms emerge from and that makes</v>

838
00:46:07.741 --> 00:46:10.350
<v Speaker 1>it fundamentally feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

839
00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:15.690
<v Speaker 1>that's one domain of</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious symbolism.</v>

840
00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:21.090
<v Speaker 1>Things get assimilated to this too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

841
00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:24.600
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the strangers part of the unknown,</v>

842
00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:27.330
<v Speaker 1>strange idea can be part of the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the emotional.</v>

843
00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:29.910
<v Speaker 1>And that's because emotion overtakes</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

844
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:32.910
<v Speaker 1>You know you're at a movie and all of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden poof,</v>

845
00:46:32.911 --> 00:46:35.700
<v Speaker 1>you dissolve in tears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it wells up from,</v>

846
00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:38.720
<v Speaker 1>from where?</v>
<v Speaker 1>From from the unknown interior and</v>

847
00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:41.640
<v Speaker 1>possesses you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at the same time it does with</v>

848
00:46:41.641 --> 00:46:44.690
<v Speaker 1>everyone else in the movie or you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone else who's tuned in,</v>

849
00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:50.090
<v Speaker 1>who has some feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So other representations of the same</v>

850
00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:54.690
<v Speaker 1>domain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the foreigner as a person who comes from</v>

851
00:46:54.691 --> 00:46:57.300
<v Speaker 1>foreign lands because they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>contaminated with things you don't</v>

852
00:46:57.301 --> 00:46:59.460
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes that can be terrible</v>

853
00:46:59.461 --> 00:47:00.990
<v Speaker 1>because the thing they're contaminated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

854
00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:05.130
<v Speaker 1>especially in human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the dark recesses of human history,</v>

855
00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:08.130
<v Speaker 1>the illnesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean God only knows where the great</v>

856
00:47:08.131 --> 00:47:10.890
<v Speaker 1>plague comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we know that it came on ships.</v>

857
00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:15.030
<v Speaker 1>And so people left Italy because that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the plague seemed to first</v>

858
00:47:15.031 --> 00:47:16.320
<v Speaker 1>manifest itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They laughed,</v>

859
00:47:16.321 --> 00:47:18.450
<v Speaker 1>they went somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>picked up some new rats,</v>

860
00:47:18.451 --> 00:47:19.830
<v Speaker 1>came home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd like poof.</v>

861
00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:23.490
<v Speaker 1>A third of Europe was dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was even worse when the Europeans</v>

862
00:47:23.491 --> 00:47:24.690
<v Speaker 1>went to the new world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

863
00:47:24.691 --> 00:47:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Because as soon as the new world datas</v>
<v Speaker 1>shook hands with the,</v>

864
00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:32.560
<v Speaker 1>it was like bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>95% of them died in the next 50 years.</v>

865
00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:36.040
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that the foreigner is</v>
<v Speaker 1>contaminated with the unknown,</v>

866
00:47:36.041 --> 00:47:38.470
<v Speaker 1>that's a nontrivial Ikea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it isn't,</v>

867
00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:41.350
<v Speaker 1>you know the pathogens they carry that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the damn I,</v>

868
00:47:41.351 --> 00:47:44.860
<v Speaker 1>he is to come sneaking into your culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just blow it into bits over,</v>

869
00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:47.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fair number of decades is something to</v>

870
00:47:47.441 --> 00:47:48.790
<v Speaker 1>be terrified of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

871
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:52.270
<v Speaker 1>by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's incalculable wealth has been</v>

872
00:47:52.271 --> 00:47:56.710
<v Speaker 1>generated culturally and materially as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the intermingling of</v>

873
00:47:56.711 --> 00:47:59.500
<v Speaker 1>human beings from all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's another one of those situations</v>

874
00:47:59.501 --> 00:48:02.290
<v Speaker 1>where it gives with one hand and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes with the other</v>

875
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:05.410
<v Speaker 1>hell death and the grave</v>

876
00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:09.413
<v Speaker 2>mood</v>

877
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:11.980
<v Speaker 1>ruler of the ninth and the mysterious</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark matter,</v>

878
00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:13.750
<v Speaker 1>matter matrix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>

879
00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:16.840
<v Speaker 1>same root words and the earth mother</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

880
00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:19.360
<v Speaker 1>So those are all those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

881
00:48:19.361 --> 00:48:23.320
<v Speaker 1>all those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those images are related to the same</v>

882
00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:27.220
<v Speaker 1>under underlying well of meaning and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

883
00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:32.250
<v Speaker 1>That's a representation of that which is</v>
<v Speaker 1>always beyond you from which all new</v>

884
00:48:32.261 --> 00:48:34.600
<v Speaker 1>things coming to which all things</v>
<v Speaker 1>return.</v>

885
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:36.790
<v Speaker 1>That's the unknown.</v>

886
00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:44.660
<v Speaker 1>Artists are very good at representing</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of thing.</v>

887
00:48:44.661 --> 00:48:46.760
<v Speaker 1>This is quite nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are your basic,</v>

888
00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:51.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell like monsters devour written other</v>

889
00:48:51.051 --> 00:48:53.120
<v Speaker 1>monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which maybe I could actually be a good</v>

890
00:48:53.121 --> 00:48:56.560
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

891
00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:59.000
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a representation in some sense of</v>

892
00:48:59.001 --> 00:49:00.890
<v Speaker 1>the war of everything against</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

893
00:49:00.891 --> 00:49:03.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old idea about nature being red in</v>

894
00:49:03.771 --> 00:49:07.430
<v Speaker 1>tooth and claw and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>devouring everything else to keep to</v>

895
00:49:07.431 --> 00:49:09.980
<v Speaker 1>keep existing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a representation too of the sort of</v>

896
00:49:09.981 --> 00:49:12.260
<v Speaker 1>pain is phrase that goes along with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>life of,</v>

897
00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:16.120
<v Speaker 1>it's even quite peaceful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nature's a vicious place and,</v>

898
00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:19.250
<v Speaker 1>and you have to contend with it and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know what it's up to you.</v>

899
00:49:19.251 --> 00:49:22.040
<v Speaker 1>And it's virtually impossible to keep up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it in,</v>

900
00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:23.240
<v Speaker 1>in Alice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in wonderland,</v>

901
00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:25.580
<v Speaker 1>Mother Nature's there and that's the red</v>
<v Speaker 1>queen,</v>

902
00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:28.940
<v Speaker 1>the Red Queen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's the one who's always yelling</v>

903
00:49:28.941 --> 00:49:31.070
<v Speaker 1>off with their heads when they're trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to play croquet.</v>

904
00:49:31.071 --> 00:49:31.791
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

905
00:49:31.791 --> 00:49:33.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just doesn't seem civilized.</v>

906
00:49:33.621 --> 00:49:34.454
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

907
00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:35.870
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

908
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:38.510
<v Speaker 1>it's the red queen who sows to Ellis in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my kingdom.</v>

909
00:49:38.511 --> 00:49:41.690
<v Speaker 1>You have to run as fast as you can and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to stay in the same place.</v>

910
00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:45.440
<v Speaker 1>That's a good definition of life because</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature is always transforming.</v>

911
00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:52.540
<v Speaker 1>This is Kelly is not the devour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a Hindu representation and a,</v>

912
00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:56.330
<v Speaker 1>well she's quite the character as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can see.</v>

913
00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you a little bit about the</v>

914
00:49:58.611 --> 00:50:02.030
<v Speaker 1>image in the middle so that you've kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of have some sense of what this,</v>

915
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:04.730
<v Speaker 1>like religious images are often trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to represent</v>

916
00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:08.660
<v Speaker 1>these fundamental realities that I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been describing,</v>

917
00:50:08.810 --> 00:50:11.720
<v Speaker 1>these underlying structures of</v>
<v Speaker 1>perception and cognition.</v>

918
00:50:11.721 --> 00:50:16.430
<v Speaker 1>So Kelly hears it's kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a representation of all the things</v>

919
00:50:16.431 --> 00:50:20.060
<v Speaker 1>that you should run away from screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a good category.</v>

920
00:50:20.061 --> 00:50:22.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like the category of monsters and</v>
<v Speaker 1>horror.</v>

921
00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:25.670
<v Speaker 1>And so let's investigate her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>

922
00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:27.020
<v Speaker 1>she's a spider.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

923
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:28.340
<v Speaker 1>she has eight lanes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

924
00:50:28.341 --> 00:50:31.370
<v Speaker 1>people don't like spiders much cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to poison us and they</v>

925
00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:35.450
<v Speaker 1>web,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're spin webs and capture the unwary</v>

926
00:50:35.451 --> 00:50:36.910
<v Speaker 1>and then devour though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

927
00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:42.560
<v Speaker 1>so she didn't this web fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the kind of call them on the arch</v>

928
00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:47.150
<v Speaker 1>rounder and the fire is full of skulls.</v>

929
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:48.980
<v Speaker 1>You can see the skull,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's inside the fire.</v>

930
00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:50.040
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

931
00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:52.580
<v Speaker 1>it's like a web of flaming skulls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

932
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:54.500
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't get more awful than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Read it.</v>

933
00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:59.560
<v Speaker 1>And then her hair's on fire and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>wears a headdress of stalls.</v>

934
00:50:59.811 --> 00:51:03.830
<v Speaker 1>And then she's brought a few weapons in</v>
<v Speaker 1>case you're not already terrified.</v>

935
00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:08.650
<v Speaker 1>And then she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she often has the tongue of a tiger of,</v>

936
00:51:08.651 --> 00:51:09.800
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if she does it,</v>

937
00:51:09.801 --> 00:51:12.170
<v Speaker 1>match the image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then often there's a snake wrapped</v>

938
00:51:12.171 --> 00:51:14.960
<v Speaker 1>around your waist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in this case it's not a snake.</v>

939
00:51:14.961 --> 00:51:18.320
<v Speaker 1>You see those sort of coyly things</v>
<v Speaker 1>around your belly to belly and sunken.</v>

940
00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:22.250
<v Speaker 1>That's cause she'd just be burst to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy that's two standard and she's</v>

941
00:51:22.251 --> 00:51:25.160
<v Speaker 1>devouring inviting a test sites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's Kelly.</v>

942
00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:30.140
<v Speaker 1>And it's a representation of everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really don't want to mess with.</v>

943
00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:33.260
<v Speaker 1>And you should be very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very careful about if you make the</v>

944
00:51:33.261 --> 00:51:36.470
<v Speaker 1>proper sacrifices to Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then maybe she'll show you her</v>

945
00:51:36.471 --> 00:51:39.140
<v Speaker 1>benevolence side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that would be a really good thing.</v>

946
00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:42.020
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have been making sacrifices to</v>

947
00:51:42.021 --> 00:51:44.930
<v Speaker 1>God's forever and God to try to get them</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stop,</v>

948
00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:45.793
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

949
00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:47.430
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

950
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:49.860
<v Speaker 1>Doing this sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

951
00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:53.250
<v Speaker 1>it's very easy for modern people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about that as a superstition,</v>

952
00:51:53.251 --> 00:51:56.040
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a superstition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most fundamental</v>

953
00:51:56.041 --> 00:51:59.880
<v Speaker 1>discoveries of mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the discovery was if you let go of</v>

954
00:51:59.881 --> 00:52:04.260
<v Speaker 1>something that you value now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you'll get something better in the</v>

955
00:52:04.261 --> 00:52:06.270
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that is that,</v>

956
00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:08.600
<v Speaker 1>that's the discovery of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

957
00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:12.480
<v Speaker 1>it's a phenomenal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a phenomenal achievement.</v>

958
00:52:12.481 --> 00:52:15.720
<v Speaker 1>And human beings are the only people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered it consciously.</v>

959
00:52:15.721 --> 00:52:17.940
<v Speaker 1>Like bees make honey and they store it</v>
<v Speaker 1>up for the winter,</v>

960
00:52:17.941 --> 00:52:20.160
<v Speaker 1>but probably they don't know what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're up to.</v>

961
00:52:20.161 --> 00:52:25.161
<v Speaker 1>But human beings can understand that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible fate might confront you,</v>

962
00:52:25.830 --> 00:52:28.560
<v Speaker 1>but if you make the right sacrifices</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

963
00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:32.730
<v Speaker 1>you'll propitiate faith and you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll survive and thrive into the</v>

964
00:52:32.731 --> 00:52:34.570
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you're all here at</v>

965
00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:38.700
<v Speaker 1>university instead of while I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I presume you did a real shortage of</v>

966
00:52:38.701 --> 00:52:40.380
<v Speaker 1>partying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least you're not doing it right</v>

967
00:52:40.381 --> 00:52:41.910
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

968
00:52:41.911 --> 00:52:46.290
<v Speaker 1>you're making sacrifices to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is that if you sacrifice</v>

969
00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:50.490
<v Speaker 1>your valuable time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time of your youth now that the</v>

970
00:52:50.491 --> 00:52:54.470
<v Speaker 1>fates will smile on you in the future</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you know you,</v>

971
00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:56.100
<v Speaker 1>if you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't believe that you wouldn't be</v>

972
00:52:56.101 --> 00:52:59.130
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you believe it and you act it out.</v>

973
00:52:59.131 --> 00:53:02.940
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand it psychologically and</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptually and archaic people</v>

974
00:53:02.941 --> 00:53:05.340
<v Speaker 1>understood it practically and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatically,</v>

975
00:53:05.341 --> 00:53:08.910
<v Speaker 1>but it was the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You better make sacrifices and hope that</v>

976
00:53:08.911 --> 00:53:11.730
<v Speaker 1>you can turn this into it's benevolent</v>
<v Speaker 1>counterpart.</v>

977
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Well then there's culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is another domain of symbols.</v>

978
00:53:17.811 --> 00:53:20.270
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very attractive domain of symbols</v>

979
00:53:20.271 --> 00:53:24.590
<v Speaker 1>mean to the degree that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an Aficionado of a sports team.</v>

980
00:53:25.090 --> 00:53:28.090
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're tangled up by your,</v>

981
00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:32.010
<v Speaker 1>your symbolic longing for a place within</v>
<v Speaker 1>a culture.</v>

982
00:53:32.011 --> 00:53:36.240
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so tied up with your psychological</v>

983
00:53:36.241 --> 00:53:38.910
<v Speaker 1>being that you will act like the team is</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

984
00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:41.970
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the weird things about human</v>

985
00:53:41.971 --> 00:53:46.950
<v Speaker 1>beings is that they'll often celebrate</v>
<v Speaker 1>the victories of their heroes or their</v>

986
00:53:46.951 --> 00:53:50.370
<v Speaker 1>teams more intensely than they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever celebrate anything that ever</v>

987
00:53:50.371 --> 00:53:51.690
<v Speaker 1>happened to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

988
00:53:51.691 --> 00:53:54.390
<v Speaker 1>how often do you see people at work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

989
00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:58.440
<v Speaker 1>throw their hands up in the air and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>run out in the hallways and dance around</v>

990
00:53:58.441 --> 00:54:00.600
<v Speaker 1>because something good has happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it never happens,</v>

991
00:54:00.601 --> 00:54:03.420
<v Speaker 1>but if it's a football game or a hockey</v>
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>

992
00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:05.070
<v Speaker 1>people will paint up their faces.</v>

993
00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:08.070
<v Speaker 1>And when there's a goal sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a symbolic act two,</v>

994
00:54:08.071 --> 00:54:09.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

995
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:12.570
<v Speaker 1>human beings like to hit the target.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a sexual element to that,</v>

996
00:54:12.571 --> 00:54:17.060
<v Speaker 1>but there's also an element of hunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's an element of specifying</v>

997
00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:18.810
<v Speaker 1>your target and achieving it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

998
00:54:18.970 --> 00:54:22.210
<v Speaker 1>and doing that cooperatively with all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other people on your team</v>

999
00:54:22.410 --> 00:54:24.570
<v Speaker 1>competitively in relationship to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other team.</v>

1000
00:54:24.571 --> 00:54:27.390
<v Speaker 1>It's real little microcosm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is,</v>

1001
00:54:27.391 --> 00:54:31.530
<v Speaker 1>is the symbolic elements of that'll grab</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just like you're a primitive</v>

1002
00:54:31.531 --> 00:54:34.170
<v Speaker 1>tribesman and you won't even notice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll think,</v>

1003
00:54:34.171 --> 00:54:35.760
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just having a party because my team</v>

1004
00:54:35.761 --> 00:54:36.390
<v Speaker 1>won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1005
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:40.220
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are some cute your creatures.</v>

1006
00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:43.440
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the teams they have their,</v>

1007
00:54:43.441 --> 00:54:45.630
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their tribal logo is essentially,</v>

1008
00:54:45.631 --> 00:54:46.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1009
00:54:46.561 --> 00:54:48.420
<v Speaker 1>and all the iconography that goes with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1010
00:54:48.421 --> 00:54:51.510
<v Speaker 1>And they're treated almost as if they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacred objects by people who are the</v>

1011
00:54:51.511 --> 00:54:52.344
<v Speaker 1>fans.</v>

1012
00:54:52.590 --> 00:54:54.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll go look at the Silver Cup and</v>

1013
00:54:54.571 --> 00:54:56.550
<v Speaker 1>they're happy as it comes to their town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1014
00:54:58.290 --> 00:55:00.480
<v Speaker 1>don't be thinking you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>superstitious,</v>

1015
00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:03.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just that our modern superstitions</v>

1016
00:55:03.061 --> 00:55:05.370
<v Speaker 1>are invisible to us and we don't notice</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're there.</v>

1017
00:55:05.371 --> 00:55:07.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're superstitious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right to the court.</v>

1018
00:55:08.310 --> 00:55:11.160
<v Speaker 1>And human beings have always feed</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

1019
00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:13.920
<v Speaker 1>superego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud's categories,</v>

1020
00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:15.240
<v Speaker 1>id,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ego,</v>

1021
00:55:15.241 --> 00:55:17.700
<v Speaker 1>superego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>map quite nicely onto nature,</v>

1022
00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:21.060
<v Speaker 1>individual coaching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of interesting.</v>

1023
00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:23.060
<v Speaker 1>Became the patriarch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the plow,</v>

1024
00:55:23.061 --> 00:55:26.160
<v Speaker 1>the Thalos order and authority and</v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition.</v>

1025
00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:31.260
<v Speaker 1>The wise old man and the tyrant dogma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day skype because it's illuminated,</v>

1026
00:55:31.261 --> 00:55:34.100
<v Speaker 1>it's illuminated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The day skies is masculine,</v>

1027
00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:36.370
<v Speaker 1>it's symbolic nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your country,</v>

1028
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:38.020
<v Speaker 1>your brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the iron,</v>

1029
00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:41.760
<v Speaker 1>the heights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and assess ancestral spirits and</v>

1030
00:55:41.770 --> 00:55:46.770
<v Speaker 1>activity of the dead</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that you're patriotic.</v>

1031
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:50.580
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're possessed by the symbolism of</v>

1032
00:55:50.581 --> 00:55:52.530
<v Speaker 1>culture and the symbolism of the known</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1033
00:55:52.531 --> 00:55:54.510
<v Speaker 1>You would regard that as a virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1034
00:55:54.650 --> 00:55:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's more important to you?</v>

1035
00:55:55.951 --> 00:55:59.730
<v Speaker 1>Your own being or your family or your</v>
<v Speaker 1>own being or your family or your</v>

1036
00:55:59.731 --> 00:56:01.890
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is more you?</v>

1037
00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not obvious and depending on the</v>

1038
00:56:04.981 --> 00:56:06.690
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people make different decisions.</v>

1039
00:56:06.691 --> 00:56:08.820
<v Speaker 1>As soon as it's war time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody says,</v>

1040
00:56:08.821 --> 00:56:11.070
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my culture is more important than me off</v>

1041
00:56:11.071 --> 00:56:11.821
<v Speaker 1>they march.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1042
00:56:11.821 --> 00:56:14.640
<v Speaker 1>even if it's world war one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all they're marching to his,</v>

1043
00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:16.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>continual death.</v>

1044
00:56:17.370 --> 00:56:19.830
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gripped by these things in ways</v>

1045
00:56:19.831 --> 00:56:21.930
<v Speaker 1>that you just cannot understand.</v>

1046
00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:29.680
<v Speaker 1>Captain Hook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a great representation of the</v>

1047
00:56:29.681 --> 00:56:31.930
<v Speaker 1>negative element of culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Hook,</v>

1048
00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:37.360
<v Speaker 1>why does he have a hook?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does captive vocab,</v>

1049
00:56:37.361 --> 00:56:40.510
<v Speaker 1>the hooker</v>
<v Speaker 1>crocodile bit it off.</v>

1050
00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:42.490
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what does the crocodile having its</v>

1051
00:56:42.491 --> 00:56:47.491
<v Speaker 1>stomach and what does that mean tide?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's bit old captain Hook's handle</v>

1052
00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:54.100
<v Speaker 1>off time is chasing him around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to take them under.</v>

1053
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:57.190
<v Speaker 1>It's already got a taste of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he's terrified of that.</v>

1054
00:56:57.191 --> 00:56:58.360
<v Speaker 1>So he's an adult male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1055
00:56:58.361 --> 00:56:59.920
<v Speaker 1>He's terrified of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a tyrant.</v>

1056
00:57:00.070 --> 00:57:03.070
<v Speaker 1>He's already lost a hand to time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that damn crocodile,</v>

1057
00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:06.580
<v Speaker 1>that's that horrible Serpentini thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that lives underneath the depths.</v>

1058
00:57:06.730 --> 00:57:09.730
<v Speaker 1>First chance it gets it going to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of these terrified about that.</v>

1059
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:13.000
<v Speaker 1>It makes them into a tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peter Pan looks at him.</v>

1060
00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:15.610
<v Speaker 1>He's the only adult being around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally.</v>

1061
00:57:15.611 --> 00:57:19.330
<v Speaker 1>He thinks there's no damn way I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a tyrant who is chased by the</v>

1062
00:57:19.331 --> 00:57:22.840
<v Speaker 1>crocodile of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stay a little boy forever.</v>

1063
00:57:23.170 --> 00:57:24.330
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't work so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1064
00:57:24.331 --> 00:57:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Cause the only gets this tinkerbell who</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't even exist and he has to let</v>

1065
00:57:27.881 --> 00:57:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Wendy go off and be real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1066
00:57:30.731 --> 00:57:32.890
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an eternal story of not growing up</v>

1067
00:57:32.891 --> 00:57:36.970
<v Speaker 1>in the face of tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a story that won't go either.</v>

1068
00:57:36.971 --> 00:57:39.610
<v Speaker 1>And it's a story that people act out</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you wouldn't believe.</v>

1069
00:57:40.890 --> 00:57:41.270
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1070
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:42.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the old man in the</v>

1071
00:57:42.741 --> 00:57:43.311
<v Speaker 1>talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1072
00:57:43.311 --> 00:57:45.230
<v Speaker 1>That's Stellan by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's kissing.</v>

1073
00:57:45.231 --> 00:57:46.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really think about that.</v>

1074
00:57:46.671 --> 00:57:50.840
<v Speaker 1>Stellan probably killed somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>between 30 and 60 million people.</v>

1075
00:57:51.050 --> 00:57:53.150
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But nevertheless,</v>

1076
00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:55.490
<v Speaker 1>it's old man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so gripped by what he represents.</v>

1077
00:57:55.491 --> 00:57:59.740
<v Speaker 1>It is sort of gold wisdom that misses</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the wall fell down that he,</v>

1078
00:57:59.850 --> 00:58:02.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't stop himself from worshiping</v>

1079
00:58:02.241 --> 00:58:04.520
<v Speaker 1>this thing that was so barbaric that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

1080
00:58:04.521 --> 00:58:08.060
<v Speaker 1>it defies description.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The good old days you have.</v>

1081
00:58:08.061 --> 00:58:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Well they weren't so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good representation of stuff.</v>

1082
00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:14.210
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A terrible element of culture.</v>

1083
00:58:14.450 --> 00:58:16.490
<v Speaker 1>And that's patriotism gone wrong.</v>

1084
00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:21.130
<v Speaker 2>Stella.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1085
00:58:22.610 --> 00:58:26.030
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's family favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked the one on the right's</v>

1086
00:58:26.031 --> 00:58:28.520
<v Speaker 1>cause he sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like the devil standing in the</v>

1087
00:58:28.521 --> 00:58:32.450
<v Speaker 1>flames of</v>
<v Speaker 1>love because it's very,</v>

1088
00:58:32.451 --> 00:58:34.960
<v Speaker 1>very accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1089
00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:37.020
<v Speaker 1>Stellan following Lennon,</v>

1090
00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:39.830
<v Speaker 2>that was quite a pair.</v>

1091
00:58:42.590 --> 00:58:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Then there's Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1092
00:58:43.731 --> 00:58:47.240
<v Speaker 1>all the 20th century's other</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of the horrible face of</v>

1093
00:58:47.241 --> 00:58:48.074
<v Speaker 1>culture</v>

1094
00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:53.790
<v Speaker 1>versus who is able to produce mass</v>
<v Speaker 1>hysteria is fall over.</v>

1095
00:58:53.810 --> 00:58:56.350
<v Speaker 1>He's the one who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who represented for them everything that</v>

1096
00:58:56.351 --> 00:58:58.570
<v Speaker 1>was noble about so called area and</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

1097
00:58:58.870 --> 00:59:03.610
<v Speaker 1>All of that was the consequence like</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature can do but so can culture and</v>

1098
00:59:03.611 --> 00:59:06.550
<v Speaker 1>that's why you know your proclivity to</v>
<v Speaker 1>identify with things,</v>

1099
00:59:06.551 --> 00:59:10.480
<v Speaker 1>to identify with groups and to identify</v>
<v Speaker 1>with states to identify with cultures.</v>

1100
00:59:10.481 --> 00:59:14.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like the greatest gift you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause it makes you civilized and</v>

1101
00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:16.840
<v Speaker 1>cooperative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also one of the most horrible</v>

1102
00:59:16.841 --> 00:59:18.920
<v Speaker 1>things about you because if it's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>activated property,</v>

1103
00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:23.940
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing more dangerous than you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I told you about this but we'll go</v>

1104
00:59:35.821 --> 00:59:37.860
<v Speaker 1>over just briefly again cause it's very</v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

1105
00:59:37.861 --> 00:59:40.950
<v Speaker 1>So this is the dallas symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That symbol is dob.</v>

1106
00:59:41.130 --> 00:59:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Dow essentially means meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also means the way it means a</v>

1107
00:59:44.971 --> 00:59:48.420
<v Speaker 1>bunch of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Dow for the Dallas does what things</v>

1108
00:59:48.421 --> 00:59:49.470
<v Speaker 1>are made up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what?</v>

1109
00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:54.420
<v Speaker 1>It's the underlying reality of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for the Dallas that's more meaning</v>

1110
00:59:54.421 --> 00:59:57.590
<v Speaker 1>than it is like material or in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>other way you could think about this is</v>

1111
00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:59.820
<v Speaker 1>more like information than it is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>material.</v>

1112
01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:01.750
<v Speaker 1>And so the Dallas think that</v>

1113
01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:03.540
<v Speaker 2>that that</v>

1114
01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:08.260
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't say reality because it's not</v>

1115
01:00:08.261 --> 01:00:11.950
<v Speaker 1>the same conception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That experience is meaningful and that</v>

1116
01:00:11.951 --> 01:00:16.120
<v Speaker 1>the meeting is the primary reality and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meaning differentiates itself as an</v>

1117
01:00:16.121 --> 01:00:20.920
<v Speaker 1>emergence and it differentiates itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>first and to masculine and feminine</v>

1118
01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:25.600
<v Speaker 1>essentially into the structure that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>use to perceive reality.</v>

1119
01:00:25.690 --> 01:00:28.870
<v Speaker 1>That's culture and what it is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're perceiving.</v>

1120
01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:33.040
<v Speaker 1>And that's nature and that it's a lovely</v>
<v Speaker 1>conception.</v>

1121
01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:36.010
<v Speaker 1>It's different than the way people look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the world in the modern world,</v>

1122
01:00:36.011 --> 01:00:37.780
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1123
01:00:37.810 --> 01:00:42.730
<v Speaker 1>it's parallel and I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not more useful,</v>

1124
01:00:42.731 --> 01:00:47.731
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly equally useful because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>helps you understand and articulate</v>

1125
01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:54.970
<v Speaker 1>elements of your own experience that</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't be understood from a framework</v>

1126
01:00:54.971 --> 01:00:56.470
<v Speaker 1>that has a different underlying</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

1127
01:00:56.471 --> 01:00:59.380
<v Speaker 1>So you know that sometimes you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable that things are going well</v>

1128
01:00:59.381 --> 01:01:03.310
<v Speaker 1>for you and you know that sometimes all</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell's broken loose and you fall through</v>

1129
01:01:03.311 --> 01:01:06.580
<v Speaker 1>the ice and you're dazed and confused</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you won't get up again.</v>

1130
01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:10.300
<v Speaker 1>And you know that those are two</v>
<v Speaker 1>different places and that you'd rather</v>

1131
01:01:10.301 --> 01:01:13.960
<v Speaker 1>be in the former than the latter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you also know that there's certain</v>

1132
01:01:13.961 --> 01:01:18.550
<v Speaker 1>ways that you should act to make sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you stay where it's comfortable and</v>

1133
01:01:18.551 --> 01:01:23.170
<v Speaker 1>interesting rather than wandering off to</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's like terrible beyond belief.</v>

1134
01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:26.230
<v Speaker 1>Not You could call that in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your innate sense of morality.</v>

1135
01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:27.363
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1136
01:01:27.370 --> 01:01:29.140
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a kind of intelligence,</v>

1137
01:01:29.141 --> 01:01:33.970
<v Speaker 1>but it's deeper than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as I said in the other class,</v>

1138
01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:38.410
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that's lovely about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dallas interpretation is that it's the</v>

1139
01:01:38.411 --> 01:01:42.220
<v Speaker 1>interplay between these two things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly brings reality forth.</v>

1140
01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:45.790
<v Speaker 1>And then if you balance the property,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the aim of a property,</v>

1141
01:01:45.791 --> 01:01:47.950
<v Speaker 1>religious life from the Dallas</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

1142
01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:51.670
<v Speaker 1>then you have all the benefits of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you understand and what you are and what</v>

1143
01:01:51.671 --> 01:01:53.440
<v Speaker 1>you're familiar with order.</v>

1144
01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:56.950
<v Speaker 1>And then you have the excitement of</v>
<v Speaker 1>having one foot in not unknown.</v>

1145
01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:00.580
<v Speaker 1>And it's a perfect place for human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings to be because not only do we want</v>

1146
01:02:00.581 --> 01:02:04.690
<v Speaker 1>to stay with what we are and conserve it</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's good,</v>

1147
01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:08.170
<v Speaker 1>but we want to continually transform it</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that it gets better and better and</v>

1148
01:02:08.171 --> 01:02:10.960
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can give you an example of this.</v>

1149
01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:12.580
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you two quick examples and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>

1150
01:02:12.581 --> 01:02:15.820
<v Speaker 1>you'll understand what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine you're watching a gymnastics</v>

1151
01:02:15.821 --> 01:02:18.070
<v Speaker 1>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two of them and the first performer</v>

1152
01:02:18.071 --> 01:02:18.904
<v Speaker 1>comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the,</v>

1153
01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:21.390
<v Speaker 1>and the fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first performer comes out,</v>

1154
01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:24.060
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this person is like perfect.</v>

1155
01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:27.660
<v Speaker 1>You can tell they expect $10,000 cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you need to master.</v>

1156
01:02:27.661 --> 01:02:32.661
<v Speaker 1>Something like working on these routines</v>
<v Speaker 1>and every single movement they make is</v>

1157
01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:37.260
<v Speaker 1>impeccable and the routine goes on for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>few minutes and then it ends in the</v>

1158
01:02:37.261 --> 01:02:37.891
<v Speaker 1>person's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1159
01:02:37.891 --> 01:02:40.740
<v Speaker 1>they're triumphant about it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody claps.</v>

1160
01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:43.830
<v Speaker 1>And the judges are all like 9.9 out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>town.</v>

1161
01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:46.920
<v Speaker 1>And people are pretty happy about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>

1162
01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:50.550
<v Speaker 1>we're all hooked into that because we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen someone demonstrate mastery.</v>

1163
01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:54.030
<v Speaker 1>And so we're thrilled about that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shows that that's what a human being</v>

1164
01:02:54.031 --> 01:02:55.560
<v Speaker 1>can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're human beings too.</v>

1165
01:02:55.561 --> 01:02:56.251
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1166
01:02:56.251 --> 01:03:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Yay for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the next candidate comes out and</v>

1167
01:03:00.511 --> 01:03:04.710
<v Speaker 1>they've got a real problem because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>course what they have to face and</v>

1168
01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:07.230
<v Speaker 1>overcome his perfection itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you might take,</v>

1169
01:03:07.231 --> 01:03:08.850
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how in the world could you possibly do</v>

1170
01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:11.400
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they get out there and this</v>

1171
01:03:11.401 --> 01:03:14.340
<v Speaker 1>performance is different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got everybody on the edge of their</v>

1172
01:03:14.341 --> 01:03:17.010
<v Speaker 1>seats because they watched that person</v>
<v Speaker 1>go through.</v>

1173
01:03:17.011 --> 01:03:20.310
<v Speaker 1>They're absolutely perfect routine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they had one twist to it.</v>

1174
01:03:20.790 --> 01:03:24.570
<v Speaker 1>They push it so hard that you can tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>by watching them that every single</v>

1175
01:03:24.571 --> 01:03:28.110
<v Speaker 1>second of the performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like this close to disaster.</v>

1176
01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:32.400
<v Speaker 1>So they've taken their perfection and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pushed it to the point where well</v>

1177
01:03:32.401 --> 01:03:35.340
<v Speaker 1>they're well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're competing,</v>

1178
01:03:35.341 --> 01:03:38.010
<v Speaker 1>they're improving themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're taking that risk.</v>

1179
01:03:38.310 --> 01:03:41.970
<v Speaker 1>And that's the sort of phenomena that</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes everybody in the audience go</v>

1180
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.420
<v Speaker 1>absolutely dead quiet cause everyone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>on their edge of their seat thinking,</v>

1181
01:03:45.930 --> 01:03:47.700
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this gonna work?</v>

1182
01:03:47.730 --> 01:03:49.320
<v Speaker 1>Is this going to work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they going to pull it off?</v>

1183
01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:51.870
<v Speaker 1>And so no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are holding their breath and</v>

1184
01:03:51.871 --> 01:03:52.411
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1185
01:03:52.411 --> 01:03:56.190
<v Speaker 1>they're tied right into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that person ends and you know,</v>

1186
01:03:56.191 --> 01:03:58.830
<v Speaker 1>they do their little tram foot landing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody's on their feet,</v>

1187
01:03:58.831 --> 01:04:01.500
<v Speaker 1>rory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because they just saw someone</v>

1188
01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:06.510
<v Speaker 1>do this perfect mastery plus they pushed</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves beyond that.</v>

1189
01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:09.900
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the proper way to play a</v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

1190
01:04:10.050 --> 01:04:12.120
<v Speaker 1>You're not just playing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but while you're playing it,</v>

1191
01:04:12.121 --> 01:04:13.890
<v Speaker 1>you're improving your ability to play</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1192
01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:19.793
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1193
01:04:20.050 --> 01:04:24.310
<v Speaker 1>here's a representation of that medieval</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

1194
01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Here's the known and here's the explorer</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing his head out past the dome of</v>

1195
01:04:29.741 --> 01:04:33.100
<v Speaker 1>the known for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what people thought reality was,</v>

1196
01:04:33.101 --> 01:04:35.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was this desk that everyone lived in</v>

1197
01:04:35.381 --> 01:04:38.210
<v Speaker 1>with this dome over top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where the stars were.</v>

1198
01:04:38.211 --> 01:04:40.180
<v Speaker 1>And that's because if you go out in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>field at night,</v>

1199
01:04:40.690 --> 01:04:43.660
<v Speaker 1>well that's kind of what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like you're on a big desk with</v>

1200
01:04:43.661 --> 01:04:44.830
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't over talk with it.</v>

1201
01:04:45.490 --> 01:04:48.250
<v Speaker 1>He's gone beyond that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to understand what's outside</v>

1202
01:04:48.251 --> 01:04:51.240
<v Speaker 1>the realm of his comprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what human beings are like.</v>

1203
01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:55.870
<v Speaker 1>We're always poking her nose out past</v>
<v Speaker 1>our limitations,</v>

1204
01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:01.940
<v Speaker 1>trying to ministers the things that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't yet mastered,</v>

1205
01:05:01.941 --> 01:05:05.330
<v Speaker 1>and there's real meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's maybe that's the deepest</v>

1206
01:05:05.331 --> 01:05:10.190
<v Speaker 1>meaning that you can experience in life</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that is the capacity to take to</v>

1207
01:05:10.191 --> 01:05:13.310
<v Speaker 1>master something inventive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>continually extend your mastery at the</v>

1208
01:05:13.311 --> 01:05:17.060
<v Speaker 1>rate that you see fit at the rate that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimal for you.</v>

1209
01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:22.530
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the opposite of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1210
01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:27.840
<v Speaker 1>So just as the great father has its</v>
<v Speaker 1>enemy,</v>

1211
01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:31.490
<v Speaker 1>the tyrant and the break mother has its</v>
<v Speaker 1>enemy the divine hour,</v>

1212
01:05:31.690 --> 01:05:34.870
<v Speaker 1>then the individual has a tendency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is very interesting</v>

1213
01:05:34.871 --> 01:05:37.810
<v Speaker 1>representation from ancient Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

1214
01:05:38.830 --> 01:05:42.730
<v Speaker 1>and this is sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's set is the Egyptian precursor to</v>

1215
01:05:42.731 --> 01:05:46.170
<v Speaker 1>the later Christian idea of Satan in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this representation,</v>

1216
01:05:46.450 --> 01:05:50.520
<v Speaker 1>it's good and evil that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like the tree of life here.</v>

1217
01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:53.710
<v Speaker 1>And what they're doing is sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>spinning it back and forth.</v>

1218
01:05:53.711 --> 01:05:58.030
<v Speaker 1>And the idea here is that human</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence is a dynamic interaction</v>

1219
01:05:58.031 --> 01:06:02.910
<v Speaker 1>between these two forces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one ending enlightenment and dried and</v>

1220
01:06:02.911 --> 01:06:04.300
<v Speaker 1>the other aiming at darkness.</v>

1221
01:06:04.570 --> 01:06:08.530
<v Speaker 1>And that's what that represents to</v>
<v Speaker 1>except in this representation,</v>

1222
01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:13.540
<v Speaker 1>it's the overcoming of the darkness</v>
<v Speaker 1>where that also happens in the Egyptian</v>

1223
01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:16.390
<v Speaker 1>stories but not in that particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

1224
01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:20.230
<v Speaker 1>So you have the known or the unknown and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's two elements,</v>

1225
01:06:20.231 --> 01:06:22.840
<v Speaker 1>negative and positive and you have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>known and it's two elements,</v>

1226
01:06:23.170 --> 01:06:25.760
<v Speaker 1>negative and positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have the individual and</v>

1227
01:06:25.770 --> 01:06:28.270
<v Speaker 1>it's two elements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative and positive.</v>

1228
01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:33.280
<v Speaker 1>And the interaction between those</v>
<v Speaker 1>categories makes up stories</v>

1229
01:06:33.370 --> 01:06:36.040
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all the stories that you ever hear</v>

1230
01:06:36.041 --> 01:06:40.810
<v Speaker 1>about how it is that you should live or</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't live are different</v>

1231
01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:44.290
<v Speaker 1>juxtapositions of those characters and</v>
<v Speaker 1>their interactions.</v>

1232
01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:49.440
<v Speaker 1>And the more archetipal the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more clearly the case that structure</v>

1233
01:06:49.841 --> 01:06:51.010
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1234
01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:55.570
<v Speaker 1>in the thor movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Loki and thor are sons of zoots,</v>

1235
01:06:55.571 --> 01:06:57.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Zeus is the great father and he</v>

1236
01:06:57.791 --> 01:07:02.050
<v Speaker 1>produces hostile brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the same that's echoed in</v>

1237
01:07:02.051 --> 01:07:05.500
<v Speaker 1>Christian stories by God and Christ and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Satan.</v>

1238
01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:10.450
<v Speaker 1>It's the same idea and candidate when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see these hostile brother patterns</v>

1239
01:07:10.690 --> 01:07:13.180
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because people have to</v>

1240
01:07:13.181 --> 01:07:17.470
<v Speaker 1>contend with what opposes the orderly</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside in the world when they're</v>

1241
01:07:17.471 --> 01:07:21.700
<v Speaker 1>contending against their opponents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of whom are corrupt and deceitful,</v>

1242
01:07:21.701 --> 01:07:26.701
<v Speaker 1>but also within themselves when they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to set themselves straight and to</v>

1243
01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:30.310
<v Speaker 1>keep at bay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those elements of their own</v>

1244
01:07:30.311 --> 01:07:33.100
<v Speaker 1>character that seemed to work at cross</v>
<v Speaker 1>purposes to themselves.</v>

1245
01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:35.380
<v Speaker 1>It's a very strange thing about people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1246
01:07:35.590 --> 01:07:40.590
<v Speaker 1>we can't just tell ourselves what to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>were inhabited by all these strange sub</v>

1247
01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:45.280
<v Speaker 1>personalities that have a certain amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of autonomy and they're off doing</v>

1248
01:07:45.281 --> 01:07:46.900
<v Speaker 1>whatever they want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At any given time.</v>

1249
01:07:46.901 --> 01:07:48.880
<v Speaker 1>And they're very difficult to bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>under control.</v>

1250
01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:51.430
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard to be the master of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>own house.</v>

1251
01:08:02.030 --> 01:08:07.030
<v Speaker 1>So I sub divided up reality for you in</v>
<v Speaker 1>one way.</v>

1252
01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:11.220
<v Speaker 1>And so for the time being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

1253
01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:14.450
<v Speaker 1>we're done with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I want to sub divide reality up in</v>

1254
01:08:14.451 --> 01:08:19.451
<v Speaker 1>another way because you can't understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in the heroic and</v>

1255
01:08:19.701 --> 01:08:23.810
<v Speaker 1>shamanic initiations and in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>view that's encapsulated there</v>

1256
01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:29.300
<v Speaker 1>and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the implication of that worldview for</v>

1257
01:08:29.301 --> 01:08:32.120
<v Speaker 1>the understanding of phenomena like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious and the unconscious</v>

1258
01:08:32.121 --> 01:08:34.670
<v Speaker 1>symbolism without looking at the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>from one other perspective.</v>

1259
01:08:34.671 --> 01:08:38.990
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a decomposition of your computer,</v>

1260
01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:42.590
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first of all we'll imagine your</v>

1261
01:08:42.591 --> 01:08:45.770
<v Speaker 1>computer's working and so then you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1262
01:08:45.771 --> 01:08:47.570
<v Speaker 1>well what is your computer when it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>working?</v>

1263
01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:52.460
<v Speaker 1>And then that's a hard question to ask</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's while your keyboard,</v>

1264
01:08:52.461 --> 01:08:55.920
<v Speaker 1>cause you're clicking on the keyboard in</v>
<v Speaker 1>all likelihood and then there's the</v>

1265
01:08:55.921 --> 01:08:59.620
<v Speaker 1>screen or there's what's on the screen</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you're not actually looking at the</v>

1266
01:08:59.621 --> 01:09:00.710
<v Speaker 1>screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1267
01:09:00.710 --> 01:09:03.500
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at what's on the screen</v>
<v Speaker 1>and isn't even clear where that is.</v>

1268
01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:08.270
<v Speaker 1>But the computer while you're using it</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of collapses itself down into what</v>

1269
01:09:08.271 --> 01:09:10.310
<v Speaker 1>you're watching on the screen and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're interacting with.</v>

1270
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:12.350
<v Speaker 1>That's the computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden,</v>

1271
01:09:12.351 --> 01:09:13.550
<v Speaker 1>poof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it stops working.</v>

1272
01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:15.890
<v Speaker 1>So you have an emotional response to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1273
01:09:15.891 --> 01:09:17.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the monkey who's just seen a</v>

1274
01:09:17.751 --> 01:09:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Jaguar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it upsets you.</v>

1275
01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:23.390
<v Speaker 1>And the reason it upsets you is because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually don't have a clue about</v>

1276
01:09:23.391 --> 01:09:25.760
<v Speaker 1>your computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it either works well,</v>

1277
01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:29.690
<v Speaker 1>some of you more than others either</v>
<v Speaker 1>works and then it's a computer or it</v>

1278
01:09:29.691 --> 01:09:33.410
<v Speaker 1>doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which case God only knows what it is</v>

1279
01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:36.530
<v Speaker 1>or what you're going to do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>

1280
01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:40.610
<v Speaker 1>this is a good example of how what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand can collapse into what you</v>

1281
01:09:40.611 --> 01:09:43.220
<v Speaker 1>don't understand because the computer</v>
<v Speaker 1>turns out to be an unbelievably</v>

1282
01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:47.390
<v Speaker 1>complicated thing and it can fail for</v>
<v Speaker 1>innumerable reasons.</v>

1283
01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:51.230
<v Speaker 1>And if you want to fix it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to take into account it's</v>

1284
01:09:51.231 --> 01:09:55.820
<v Speaker 1>insane complexity and start to piece it</v>
<v Speaker 1>back together so that it starts to</v>

1285
01:09:55.821 --> 01:09:59.150
<v Speaker 1>behave like the computer you want it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be instead of like a,</v>

1286
01:09:59.330 --> 01:10:00.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>

1287
01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:04.730
<v Speaker 1>long oblong rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you have to do?</v>

1288
01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:07.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I represented the computers,</v>

1289
01:10:07.161 --> 01:10:12.161
<v Speaker 1>that little black rectangle in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle and it's expanded it down one</v>

1290
01:10:12.681 --> 01:10:14.690
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your computer's obviously full of</v>

1291
01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:19.700
<v Speaker 1>subcomponents of all sorts boards and</v>
<v Speaker 1>chips and all the little things inside</v>

1292
01:10:20.121 --> 01:10:24.260
<v Speaker 1>of the electronic things that all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>which when they work you can ignore,</v>

1293
01:10:24.261 --> 01:10:28.880
<v Speaker 1>but when they don't work instantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>constitute a whole nest of snakes.</v>

1294
01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:31.430
<v Speaker 1>And so any of those sub components could</v>
<v Speaker 1>have gone wrong.</v>

1295
01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:36.260
<v Speaker 1>And then the sub components or me having</v>
<v Speaker 1>to even smaller parts of course in any</v>

1296
01:10:36.261 --> 01:10:37.190
<v Speaker 1>of those could go wrong.</v>

1297
01:10:37.190 --> 01:10:41.440
<v Speaker 1>And then underneath that there's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>element of properties that the mighty</v>

1298
01:10:41.441 --> 01:10:43.520
<v Speaker 1>parts have to contend with in order to</v>
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>

1299
01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:46.760
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well sometimes weird things happen down</v>

1300
01:10:46.761 --> 01:10:48.830
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know if you know this or not,</v>

1301
01:10:48.831 --> 01:10:53.831
<v Speaker 1>but computer chips have now got so small</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's only some probability that</v>

1302
01:10:55.101 --> 01:10:57.470
<v Speaker 1>the electrons that are flowing along a</v>
<v Speaker 1>given wire,</v>

1303
01:10:57.530 --> 01:11:02.530
<v Speaker 1>we'll actually be in that wire because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uncertainty principle specifies that</v>

1304
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:07.460
<v Speaker 1>electron is probably here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might also be somewhere else.</v>

1305
01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:12.530
<v Speaker 1>And at small enough levels of resolution</v>
<v Speaker 1>or high enough levels of resolution that</v>

1306
01:11:12.531 --> 01:11:16.110
<v Speaker 1>actually to become a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the electrodes can just get outside</v>

1307
01:11:16.111 --> 01:11:21.111
<v Speaker 1>the wires and that causes shorts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So probably your computer isn't failing</v>

1308
01:11:21.271 --> 01:11:24.510
<v Speaker 1>because of some pathology at the quantum</v>
<v Speaker 1>level of reality.</v>

1309
01:11:24.511 --> 01:11:29.511
<v Speaker 1>But you never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Micro part might be not working property</v>

1310
01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:32.480
<v Speaker 1>component where you going to be working</v>
<v Speaker 1>property.</v>

1311
01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's other ways of,</v>

1312
01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:36.600
<v Speaker 1>of the process of considering the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem too.</v>

1313
01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:39.690
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the last time I ever buy a</v>

1314
01:11:39.691 --> 01:11:43.740
<v Speaker 1>compaq computer and then what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is you're attributing because of</v>

1315
01:11:43.741 --> 01:11:46.380
<v Speaker 1>its failure to act like a computer to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brand.</v>

1316
01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:49.740
<v Speaker 1>And then he might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I bought one of those,</v>

1317
01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:53.490
<v Speaker 1>I bought a computer from a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from an economic system that's still</v>

1318
01:11:53.491 --> 01:11:55.410
<v Speaker 1>somewhat pathological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>

1319
01:11:55.411 --> 01:11:57.420
<v Speaker 1>well it's a Chinese part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

1320
01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:02.010
<v Speaker 1>And as a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brand isn't reliable and the reason</v>

1321
01:12:02.011 --> 01:12:05.070
<v Speaker 1>the brand isn't reliable is because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic system isn't reliable.</v>

1322
01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:07.320
<v Speaker 1>And that's because the political system</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't reliable.</v>

1323
01:12:07.321 --> 01:12:09.870
<v Speaker 1>So maybe the reason your computer</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't function is because the</v>

1324
01:12:09.871 --> 01:12:13.440
<v Speaker 1>political system that surrounds the</v>
<v Speaker 1>manufacturer doesn't function well.</v>

1325
01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:16.830
<v Speaker 1>So he ended up with a cheap part and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't work.</v>

1326
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:20.430
<v Speaker 1>And so all of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as your computer stocks being</v>

1327
01:12:20.431 --> 01:12:24.180
<v Speaker 1>what it is to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the keyboard and the screen or</v>

1328
01:12:24.181 --> 01:12:26.880
<v Speaker 1>what's behind the screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say that all of a sudden it turns into</v>

1329
01:12:26.881 --> 01:12:30.600
<v Speaker 1>all these other things that it could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to get it working like a</v>

1330
01:12:30.601 --> 01:12:34.860
<v Speaker 1>computer again or even to replace it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to contend with all of these</v>

1331
01:12:34.861 --> 01:12:36.420
<v Speaker 1>other multiple levels of reality.</v>

1332
01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:40.620
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two lessons from that.</v>

1333
01:12:40.650 --> 01:12:43.950
<v Speaker 1>One is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's why you get stressed when</v>

1334
01:12:43.951 --> 01:12:47.100
<v Speaker 1>something stops working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because when it's working,</v>

1335
01:12:47.550 --> 01:12:49.980
<v Speaker 1>it's doing what you wanted to do and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>

1336
01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:53.550
<v Speaker 1>The fact that it's doing what you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to do defines what it is.</v>

1337
01:12:53.790 --> 01:12:57.090
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as it stops working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows what it is.</v>

1338
01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:58.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cars are like that,</v>

1339
01:12:58.771 --> 01:13:02.340
<v Speaker 1>except they're even worse because with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>computer you can usually just throw it</v>

1340
01:13:02.341 --> 01:13:03.570
<v Speaker 1>away and replace it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1341
01:13:03.571 --> 01:13:04.860
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's a couple of hundred</v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars,</v>

1342
01:13:04.861 --> 01:13:07.140
<v Speaker 1>but maybe something went wrong with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

1343
01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a complete bloody</v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe because not only does it not</v>

1344
01:13:11.641 --> 01:13:13.650
<v Speaker 1>function as a car and how it's just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunk of metal,</v>

1345
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:18.060
<v Speaker 1>but you have to take it to someone who</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know to fix it.</v>

1346
01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:21.300
<v Speaker 1>And who knows what they're going to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

1347
01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Like they might fix it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they might not,</v>

1348
01:13:23.371 --> 01:13:25.560
<v Speaker 1>or they might take something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually isn't wrong or they might</v>

1349
01:13:25.561 --> 01:13:26.430
<v Speaker 1>overcharge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are,</v>

1350
01:13:26.610 --> 01:13:28.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole rat's nest that's</v>

1351
01:13:28.381 --> 01:13:31.920
<v Speaker 1>associated with having your car break</v>
<v Speaker 1>down and that tangles you write up.</v>

1352
01:13:31.921 --> 01:13:33.990
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because as soon as the car</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaks down,</v>

1353
01:13:33.991 --> 01:13:37.800
<v Speaker 1>then you have to contend with the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture that surrounds the car and any</v>

1354
01:13:37.801 --> 01:13:39.900
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the pathology that might be</v>

1355
01:13:39.901 --> 01:13:41.820
<v Speaker 1>embedded in that culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1356
01:13:41.821 --> 01:13:45.790
<v Speaker 1>So one way of thinking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1357
01:13:45.930 --> 01:13:49.440
<v Speaker 1>computers like that manifests itself on</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple levels simultaneously,</v>

1358
01:13:49.441 --> 01:13:52.830
<v Speaker 1>but so do people and so to all other</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena will stick with people.</v>

1359
01:13:52.831 --> 01:13:55.470
<v Speaker 1>For now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know there's a level at which you're</v>

1360
01:13:55.471 --> 01:13:59.430
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologically a parent and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the level at which we all see each</v>

1361
01:13:59.431 --> 01:14:01.560
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see your front but not the back of</v>

1362
01:14:01.561 --> 01:14:02.490
<v Speaker 1>you or the sides of you.</v>

1363
01:14:02.490 --> 01:14:04.920
<v Speaker 1>And I can see your outside but not your</v>
<v Speaker 1>insight.</v>

1364
01:14:04.921 --> 01:14:08.820
<v Speaker 1>And I can see you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see your family that surrounds</v>

1365
01:14:08.821 --> 01:14:11.040
<v Speaker 1>you all the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was a chimpanzee and we were</v>

1366
01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:14.380
<v Speaker 1>looking at each other and I knew you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were a high status chimpanzee,</v>

1367
01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:18.160
<v Speaker 1>my body would detect your family because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would know that if I messed with you,</v>

1368
01:14:19.570 --> 01:14:23.290
<v Speaker 1>they'd come after.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I would perceive your nesting in</v>

1369
01:14:23.291 --> 01:14:25.730
<v Speaker 1>the social group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you don't,</v>

1370
01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:29.170
<v Speaker 1>you'd sort of manifest yourself to me as</v>
<v Speaker 1>as just the body.</v>

1371
01:14:29.730 --> 01:14:31.030
<v Speaker 1>But my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1372
01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:33.520
<v Speaker 1>my physiology would be smarter than</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1373
01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:39.240
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>another way of thinking about the world</v>

1374
01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:44.140
<v Speaker 1>is like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a very old symbol as well.</v>

1375
01:14:44.141 --> 01:14:47.560
<v Speaker 1>So this is like the tree of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the Scandinavian tree of</v>

1376
01:14:47.561 --> 01:14:48.910
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is called him,</v>

1377
01:14:48.911 --> 01:14:52.960
<v Speaker 1>does Disneyland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then interestingly enough,</v>

1378
01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:56.710
<v Speaker 1>there's a Peruvian tree of life from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazonian jungle.</v>

1379
01:14:56.710 --> 01:15:01.120
<v Speaker 1>So that's quite cool I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it goes what goes look</v>

1380
01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:04.510
<v Speaker 1>remarkably similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right down to the fact that,</v>

1381
01:15:04.511 --> 01:15:08.710
<v Speaker 1>see at the bottom here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is rooted in chaos.</v>

1382
01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:13.390
<v Speaker 1>So down here maybe you can see there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes and the snakes are eating the</v>

1383
01:15:13.391 --> 01:15:14.710
<v Speaker 1>roots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're always doing that.</v>

1384
01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:18.520
<v Speaker 1>But there's water down there and at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same rate that the snakes eat the roots,</v>

1385
01:15:18.610 --> 01:15:22.360
<v Speaker 1>the water makes the roots grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's an idea that this whole</v>

1386
01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:27.840
<v Speaker 1>multi level manifestation of reality is</v>
<v Speaker 1>grounded in that chaos that constantly</v>

1387
01:15:28.061 --> 01:15:32.320
<v Speaker 1>renews itself and its Serpentine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in the one next to it,</v>

1388
01:15:32.321 --> 01:15:37.030
<v Speaker 1>you can see there's the mountain air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there isn't in this representation,</v>

1389
01:15:37.031 --> 01:15:39.200
<v Speaker 1>but you see that big snake that's around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mound,</v>

1390
01:15:39.570 --> 01:15:41.980
<v Speaker 1>it's biting it's tail there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's called a neuro growth.</v>

1391
01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:47.320
<v Speaker 1>So that's another indication of the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>that order that's culture is surrounded</v>

1392
01:15:47.321 --> 01:15:49.710
<v Speaker 1>by chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chaos is representative by that,</v>

1393
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:51.540
<v Speaker 1>that big snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1394
01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:54.090
<v Speaker 1>and I think in this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a snake.</v>

1395
01:15:56.530 --> 01:15:59.290
<v Speaker 1>There's a snake in the Scandinavian</v>
<v Speaker 1>world tree just like there is in the</v>

1396
01:15:59.291 --> 01:16:00.640
<v Speaker 1>tree by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Genesis.</v>

1397
01:16:00.641 --> 01:16:01.810
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1398
01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:06.900
<v Speaker 1>and then there's this tree which is</v>
<v Speaker 1>being drawn by a woman named Angelica</v>

1399
01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:10.390
<v Speaker 1>Gebhardt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sayer went to the Peruvian jungle and</v>

1400
01:16:10.391 --> 01:16:13.990
<v Speaker 1>ask the showman there about their</v>
<v Speaker 1>visions of the world and drew this</v>

1401
01:16:13.991 --> 01:16:16.330
<v Speaker 1>picture as a consequence of what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>told her.</v>

1402
01:16:16.331 --> 01:16:17.620
<v Speaker 1>And what you notice is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1403
01:16:17.621 --> 01:16:20.770
<v Speaker 1>here's a tree and there's this big snake</v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounds it.</v>

1404
01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:24.760
<v Speaker 1>And so that's an architectural idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so archetypical that,</v>

1405
01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:27.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ancient scandinavians and the</v>

1406
01:16:27.790 --> 01:16:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Peruvian Shaman in the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazonian rainforest can have the same</v>

1407
01:16:30.791 --> 01:16:33.370
<v Speaker 1>vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the vision of reality is associated</v>

1408
01:16:33.371 --> 01:16:36.070
<v Speaker 1>with that multilevel idea that I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>told you about.</v>

1409
01:16:36.071 --> 01:16:38.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can the world be like a tree?</v>

1410
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:41.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is like a tree that sprouts up</v>

1411
01:16:41.321 --> 01:16:44.140
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the tiniest places up into the,</v>

1412
01:16:44.290 --> 01:16:46.090
<v Speaker 1>into the grandest areas.</v>

1413
01:16:46.330 --> 01:16:49.540
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has multiple levels of resolution.</v>

1414
01:16:49.930 --> 01:16:52.870
<v Speaker 1>And that's what this represents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a really lovely way of thinking</v>

1415
01:16:52.871 --> 01:16:53.704
<v Speaker 1>about things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1416
01:16:53.890 --> 01:16:56.370
<v Speaker 1>it's not a way that we think about them</v>
<v Speaker 1>normally and,</v>

1417
01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:57.610
<v Speaker 1>but it's relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1418
01:16:57.611 --> 01:17:02.611
<v Speaker 1>Because what you are isn't just what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>present phenomenologically which is what</v>

1419
01:17:03.941 --> 01:17:06.730
<v Speaker 1>everyone else experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all the microsystems that you're</v>

1420
01:17:06.731 --> 01:17:10.640
<v Speaker 1>made up of that are invisible and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>can go wrong and it has to be diagnosed</v>

1421
01:17:10.641 --> 01:17:14.270
<v Speaker 1>in fixed and then just like that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>embedded in your families and your</v>

1422
01:17:14.271 --> 01:17:17.160
<v Speaker 1>larger cultures and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if there's pathology there,</v>

1423
01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:22.330
<v Speaker 1>there's pathology and you as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you are structured in this tree</v>

1424
01:17:22.731 --> 01:17:27.731
<v Speaker 1>like matrix of interconnections right</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the subatomic level all the way up</v>

1425
01:17:29.210 --> 01:17:32.930
<v Speaker 1>to the cosmic level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all affecting you all</v>

1426
01:17:32.931 --> 01:17:35.000
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a very nice way of</v>

1427
01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:36.560
<v Speaker 1>representing that.</v>

1428
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:41.690
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you one more picture and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll stop.</v>

1429
01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:46.730
<v Speaker 1>My son drew this when he was eight and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a very well ordered psyche,</v>

1430
01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:49.700
<v Speaker 1>which I was quite happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But look,</v>

1431
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:50.541
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me show you.</v>

1432
01:17:50.541 --> 01:17:54.110
<v Speaker 1>I never thought it was amazing when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>came [inaudible] you see my office.</v>

1433
01:17:54.111 --> 01:17:58.910
<v Speaker 1>So first of all you have that's ordered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are all mushroom houses for</v>

1434
01:17:58.911 --> 01:18:02.690
<v Speaker 1>reasons I really don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of his friends live in those</v>

1435
01:18:02.691 --> 01:18:05.720
<v Speaker 1>mushroom houses and they all have his</v>
<v Speaker 1>friend's name on them and they put out</v>

1436
01:18:05.721 --> 01:18:07.430
<v Speaker 1>little fires cause kids always draw</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1437
01:18:07.431 --> 01:18:09.050
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always a chimney with the fire.</v>

1438
01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:13.250
<v Speaker 1>Who knows why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's order.</v>

1439
01:18:13.251 --> 01:18:14.660
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the line down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle,</v>

1440
01:18:14.661 --> 01:18:17.090
<v Speaker 1>like the Yin and Yang line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then another side,</v>

1441
01:18:17.091 --> 01:18:18.860
<v Speaker 1>here's nature and chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1442
01:18:19.130 --> 01:18:22.310
<v Speaker 1>And then the tree of life grows right in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle.</v>

1443
01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:24.840
<v Speaker 1>So that's the sort of Jack in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beanstalk tree of life,</v>

1444
01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:26.533
<v Speaker 1>what's happening.</v>

1445
01:18:26.570 --> 01:18:29.150
<v Speaker 1>You may see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see there's a lady by the gear and then</v>

1446
01:18:29.151 --> 01:18:32.000
<v Speaker 1>there's another lady bump on the vine</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I guess that's him.</v>

1447
01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:36.290
<v Speaker 1>And he climbs up the tree of life in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>heaven because that's heaven up there</v>

1448
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:39.290
<v Speaker 1>and then climbs back down and with</v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

1449
01:18:39.291 --> 01:18:43.490
<v Speaker 1>And so what he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well he's barely order and chaos is</v>

1450
01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:46.520
<v Speaker 1>climbing up and down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We turn all the tree of life to the</v>

1451
01:18:46.521 --> 01:18:49.100
<v Speaker 1>route of his ancestors and then coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

1452
01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:52.850
<v Speaker 1>So amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you listen to kids dreams and if you</v>

1453
01:18:52.851 --> 01:18:54.980
<v Speaker 1>watch what they draw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see them produce these sorts of</v>

1454
01:18:54.981 --> 01:18:56.540
<v Speaker 1>architectural things all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

1455
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:59.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably it's not exactly exactly</v>

1456
01:18:59.391 --> 01:19:00.740
<v Speaker 1>instinctual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1457
01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:06.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a matrix that has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>form that can be filled in by cultural</v>

1458
01:19:06.081 --> 01:19:06.831
<v Speaker 1>content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1459
01:19:06.831 --> 01:19:08.770
<v Speaker 1>he'd heard Jack in the beanstalk and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1460
01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:11.120
<v Speaker 1>we've watched Disney movies and read all</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of books,</v>

1461
01:19:11.121 --> 01:19:15.050
<v Speaker 1>and so he could pick up the patterns</v>
<v Speaker 1>from those things and manifest</v>

1462
01:19:15.051 --> 01:19:18.410
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still remarkable.</v>

1463
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:21.590
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1464
01:19:21.650 --> 01:19:24.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll account for it a bit more on</v>

1465
01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:27.080
<v Speaker 1>Thursday.</v>
