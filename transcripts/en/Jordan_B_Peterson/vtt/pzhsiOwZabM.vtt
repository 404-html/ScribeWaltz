1
00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.023
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.110
<v Speaker 2>you really can't tell the meaning of </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's life till the very end.</v>

3
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.580
<v Speaker 2>It's for the same reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4
00:00:37.581 --> 00:00:38.414
<v Speaker 2>Is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>how all the pieces fit together in the </v>

5
00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:42.434
<v Speaker 2>story or in the life is not necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>determined until the final moment and I </v>

6
00:00:45.741 --> 00:00:48.800
<v Speaker 2>think that's part of the reason too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why among Catholics,</v>

7
00:00:48.801 --> 00:00:51.260
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Christians in general,</v>

8
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.590
<v Speaker 2>there's an idea that salvation can </v>
<v Speaker 2>always be attained,</v>

9
00:00:54.591 --> 00:00:55.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right up until the last moment.</v>

10
00:00:55.881 --> 00:00:57.620
<v Speaker 2>No matter what your life was like and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

11
00:00:57.621 --> 00:01:01.480
<v Speaker 2>well that's a pretty cheap trick because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can run around doing terrible things</v>

12
00:01:01.481 --> 00:01:02.314
<v Speaker 2>your whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as long as you get it together the </v>

13
00:01:03.381 --> 00:01:04.910
<v Speaker 2>last second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're Scott free.</v>

14
00:01:04.911 --> 00:01:07.130
<v Speaker 2>But if you think about it in terms of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>

15
00:01:07.131 --> 00:01:07.964
<v Speaker 2>then you can understand how that could </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceivably be the case and it's for </v>

16
00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:13.130
<v Speaker 2>this reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

17
00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:13.964
<v Speaker 2>that this lecture in particular makes me</v>
<v Speaker 2>nervous more than any of the other ones </v>

18
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.990
<v Speaker 2>I do because I've been telling you a </v>
<v Speaker 2>story that's basically 40 hours long.</v>

19
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.823
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's spoken for them and then who </v>

20
00:01:24.111 --> 00:01:27.800
<v Speaker 2>knows how long and it's written for him </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's.</v>

21
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.673
<v Speaker 2>It's complicated to pull it together </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly and that's partly because as </v>

22
00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:32.444
<v Speaker 2>far as I've been concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been talking about issues in </v>

23
00:01:35.211 --> 00:01:37.550
<v Speaker 2>psychology that are more difficult than </v>
<v Speaker 2>any other,</v>

24
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.260
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptually,</v>

25
00:01:39.261 --> 00:01:40.094
<v Speaker 2>even from a neuropsychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective because I've been offering </v>

26
00:01:42.261 --> 00:01:43.094
<v Speaker 2>you a model of the way the brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>processes the environment that I think </v>

27
00:01:45.951 --> 00:01:46.784
<v Speaker 2>is really novel and and I think it </v>
<v Speaker 2>reflects the current state of </v>

28
00:01:49.851 --> 00:01:52.910
<v Speaker 2>neuroscience and but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more than that,</v>

29
00:01:52.911 --> 00:01:56.090
<v Speaker 2>there's the problem that we've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with issues all the way along of</v>

30
00:01:56.091 --> 00:02:00.530
<v Speaker 2>life and death and of war and </v>
<v Speaker 2>destruction and have the possibility for</v>

31
00:02:00.531 --> 00:02:01.364
<v Speaker 2>all clearheaded optimism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A possibility which as we've discussed </v>

32
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.350
<v Speaker 2>more or less escape tolstoy say for most</v>
<v Speaker 2>of his life.</v>

33
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.213
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when tolstoy woke up from his </v>

34
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.240
<v Speaker 2>delusions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he looked at the world and he said,</v>

35
00:02:14.241 --> 00:02:16.950
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly it's such a terrible place.</v>

36
00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:21.790
<v Speaker 2>That as if you're not looking at it </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the veils of illusion,</v>

37
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.780
<v Speaker 2>there is no way that you can do anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>but stand in opposition to it.</v>

38
00:02:25.781 --> 00:02:28.150
<v Speaker 2>Once you understand its basic structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

39
00:02:28.151 --> 00:02:28.984
<v Speaker 2>Suffering and innocent suffering and </v>
<v Speaker 2>complete vulnerability and the whole </v>

40
00:02:33.491 --> 00:02:38.491
<v Speaker 2>existential mass that makes up life out </v>
<v Speaker 2>turns out that tolstoy overcame his</v>

41
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.200
<v Speaker 2>rationally induced cynicism in a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>mystical way.</v>

42
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:49.183
<v Speaker 2>He had a dream that he was suspended </v>
<v Speaker 2>from some transcendent space by a belt </v>

43
00:02:53.151 --> 00:02:53.984
<v Speaker 2>around the middle of his waist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which hung them over a period of chaos </v>

44
00:02:56.751 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 2>and in that image he found and fair </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>

45
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.490
<v Speaker 2>it's a powerful image,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not well delineated.</v>

46
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.383
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it worked well for tolstoy and you </v>

47
00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:08.410
<v Speaker 2>can see that the image has power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't.</v>

48
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 2>You can't grab it with your rational </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>

49
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:11.854
<v Speaker 2>You can't take it into pieces and </v>
<v Speaker 2>analyze it as an argument and that's </v>

50
00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:17.020
<v Speaker 2>what we do if we're intellectuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

51
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:17.854
<v Speaker 2>We try to understand the detailed </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure of something and I think the </v>

52
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:23.284
<v Speaker 2>detailed structure of what tolstoy </v>
<v Speaker 2>apprehended as optimistic is actually </v>

53
00:03:27.971 --> 00:03:28.804
<v Speaker 2>comprehensible and we've been working </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards that and circling around to the </v>

54
00:03:33.461 --> 00:03:38.461
<v Speaker 2>entire course of this lecture series,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I found with this material that with</v>

55
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:43.740
<v Speaker 2>each circling around the target,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets clearer and clearer.</v>

56
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:44.643
<v Speaker 2>It's a funny thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're looking at something </v>

57
00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:49.030
<v Speaker 2>that's too complicated to see all at </v>
<v Speaker 2>once,</v>

58
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:49.864
<v Speaker 2>so you have to look at it from multiple </v>
<v Speaker 2>different perspectives and again and </v>

59
00:03:52.271 --> 00:03:53.680
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and each time you look at it,</v>

60
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.903
<v Speaker 2>it becomes clearer and clearer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That still the case for me when I go </v>

61
00:03:57.311 --> 00:03:59.020
<v Speaker 2>through this material,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time I go through it,</v>

62
00:03:59.021 --> 00:03:59.621
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

63
00:03:59.621 --> 00:04:00.454
<v Speaker 2>that piece fits there and that piece </v>
<v Speaker 2>fits there and that's how that makes </v>

64
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:04.294
<v Speaker 2>sense and oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot more remarkable than I </v>

65
00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:06.874
<v Speaker 2>thought it was to begin with and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it seems fundamentally </v>

66
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:09.454
<v Speaker 2>inexhaustible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course that's what you'd expect </v>

67
00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:12.340
<v Speaker 2>from deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep stories,</v>

68
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:13.174
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stories that have been around for </v>

69
00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:14.974
<v Speaker 2>thousands and thousands of years </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't have been around for thousands </v>

70
00:04:17.321 --> 00:04:20.560
<v Speaker 2>and thousands of years unless they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>in some sense,</v>

71
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:21.394
<v Speaker 2>inexhaustible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we've talked about some of the </v>

72
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:24.610
<v Speaker 2>processes that might contribute to that.</v>

73
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:25.443
<v Speaker 2>Inexhaustible it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at the beginning of the lecture </v>

74
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:30.214
<v Speaker 2>series,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you to consider the assumption </v>

75
00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:35.050
<v Speaker 2>that there was more than one way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at the world.</v>

76
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.483
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was the standard materialist sort </v>

77
00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:38.914
<v Speaker 2>of scientific viewpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was that the world was made up of </v>

78
00:04:41.171 --> 00:04:44.470
<v Speaker 2>objects independently existent us among </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

79
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.070
<v Speaker 2>the objects have no intrinsic value one </v>
<v Speaker 2>way or another,</v>

80
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.340
<v Speaker 2>and the issue of meaning per se wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>included in that account,</v>

81
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.540
<v Speaker 2>and then I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well wait,</v>

82
00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:56.374
<v Speaker 2>there's another way of looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world that we spent just as much time </v>

83
00:04:58.121 --> 00:05:01.870
<v Speaker 2>developing that we utilize even more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the narrative.</v>

84
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.903
<v Speaker 2>That's the narrative way of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world to consider the nature of the </v>

85
00:05:07.121 --> 00:05:07.954
<v Speaker 2>experience rather than the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 2>objects as real to consider your </v>

86
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:12.754
<v Speaker 2>experience as real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it includes things that </v>

87
00:05:14.291 --> 00:05:18.280
<v Speaker 2>can't be easily and tangibly identified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things like emotions,</v>

88
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.120
<v Speaker 2>which of course you find compelling </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes even beyond your will.</v>

89
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.480
<v Speaker 2>Things like motivational states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fantasies,</v>

90
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.170
<v Speaker 2>ideals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the things that compel your behavior</v>

91
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.213
<v Speaker 2>and give you some sense that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction to life and people who study </v>

92
00:05:33.941 --> 00:05:34.774
<v Speaker 2>emotion and perception have come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To understand that the act of </v>

93
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.910
<v Speaker 2>transforming the world into something </v>
<v Speaker 2>simply made out of objects is incredibly</v>

94
00:05:42.911 --> 00:05:43.744
<v Speaker 2>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so difficult that we haven't been </v>

95
00:05:44.951 --> 00:05:47.500
<v Speaker 2>able to design machines that can do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>

96
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.630
<v Speaker 2>It turns out also that when we look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>

97
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:51.880
<v Speaker 2>we're not just looking at it with our </v>
<v Speaker 2>visual systems,</v>

98
00:05:51.881 --> 00:05:52.714
<v Speaker 2>but we're looking at it with our motor </v>
<v Speaker 2>output systems and our emotions so that </v>

99
00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.000
<v Speaker 2>when you look at something like a chair </v>
<v Speaker 2>which just stands there for you,</v>

100
00:06:00.001 --> 00:06:00.834
<v Speaker 2>like an object,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns out that the mechanical </v>

101
00:06:03.631 --> 00:06:04.464
<v Speaker 2>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the motor systems that you would use to </v>

102
00:06:06.571 --> 00:06:07.404
<v Speaker 2>use the chair to sit on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are activated during the act of </v>

103
00:06:09.421 --> 00:06:10.254
<v Speaker 2>perception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also turns out sometimes that when </v>

104
00:06:11.491 --> 00:06:13.950
<v Speaker 2>you look at something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if it's something you've done</v>

105
00:06:13.951 --> 00:06:16.170
<v Speaker 2>to understanding that it's and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>scares you,</v>

106
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.860
<v Speaker 2>you actually react to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptualize it with your body and with</v>

107
00:06:22.201 --> 00:06:23.034
<v Speaker 2>your emotions before you have any idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it is from the perspective of an </v>

108
00:06:25.951 --> 00:06:26.784
<v Speaker 2>object.</v>

109
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.550
<v Speaker 2>When you look at the world and when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about the world,</v>

110
00:06:33.551 --> 00:06:34.384
<v Speaker 2>you have to do it from a motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm motivated perspective and an </v>

111
00:06:37.301 --> 00:06:38.134
<v Speaker 2>emotionally written perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't even see the world without </v>

112
00:06:41.051 --> 00:06:44.200
<v Speaker 2>being gripped by your motivation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional states,</v>

113
00:06:44.201 --> 00:06:45.034
<v Speaker 2>and so the idea that rationality or </v>
<v Speaker 2>perception is somehow separate from or </v>

114
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:54.870
<v Speaker 2>or superordinate to</v>
<v Speaker 2>perception and emotion is just wrong.</v>

115
00:06:56.021 --> 00:07:00.010
<v Speaker 2>We understand now that you can't even </v>
<v Speaker 2>think without being motivated.</v>

116
00:07:00.011 --> 00:07:03.340
<v Speaker 2>You can't see the world without being </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivated and that means you always look</v>

117
00:07:03.341 --> 00:07:07.300
<v Speaker 2>at the world through a kind of Lens and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Lens is a narrowing lands and it has</v>

118
00:07:07.301 --> 00:07:09.340
<v Speaker 2>to be because the world is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated.</v>

119
00:07:09.341 --> 00:07:10.174
<v Speaker 2>You can't see it all at once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're only seeing tiny slices of it in </v>

120
00:07:13.031 --> 00:07:13.864
<v Speaker 2>time and tiny slices of it in space and </v>
<v Speaker 2>and even then you have to narrow it to </v>

121
00:07:17.621 --> 00:07:18.454
<v Speaker 2>only those things that are relevant to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you at that moment and we don't know </v>

122
00:07:21.161 --> 00:07:22.420
<v Speaker 2>exactly how you do that.</v>

123
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:23.403
<v Speaker 2>We know that it takes years and years of</v>
<v Speaker 2>perceptual work in infancy say so that </v>

124
00:07:28.751 --> 00:07:32.380
<v Speaker 2>you managed to build up an object </v>
<v Speaker 2>conception of the world.</v>

125
00:07:32.381 --> 00:07:33.214
<v Speaker 2>That's probably all you're doing in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first two or three years of life and </v>

126
00:07:36.461 --> 00:07:37.294
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it constantly and it's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>as complicated as learning language say </v>

127
00:07:40.211 --> 00:07:43.120
<v Speaker 2>are even more complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of it's invisible and we don't know</v>

128
00:07:43.121 --> 00:07:46.360
<v Speaker 2>how children do that and by the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can talk,</v>

129
00:07:46.361 --> 00:07:49.780
<v Speaker 2>they've already done it so they can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even tell us what they're doing.</v>

130
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:50.973
<v Speaker 2>It takes a long time to build up an </v>
<v Speaker 2>object world and when you look at the </v>

131
00:07:53.801 --> 00:07:56.320
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you go from point a to point b,</v>

132
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:57.183
<v Speaker 2>even when you're doing something as </v>
<v Speaker 2>simple as looking for food and in the </v>

133
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:00.453
<v Speaker 2>kitchen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ignore everything about the world </v>

134
00:08:02.651 --> 00:08:03.484
<v Speaker 2>that isn't relevant to making yourself a</v>
<v Speaker 2>peanut butter sandwich and you focus in </v>

135
00:08:06.911 --> 00:08:09.190
<v Speaker 2>on those few things that are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>refrigerator,</v>

136
00:08:09.191 --> 00:08:10.630
<v Speaker 2>the food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the knives,</v>

137
00:08:10.631 --> 00:08:13.690
<v Speaker 2>the cutlery and so on and everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>else is screened out.</v>

138
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.700
<v Speaker 2>Then you can't help but look at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world through that kind of lance and the</v>

139
00:08:18.701 --> 00:08:21.340
<v Speaker 2>lenses change and you can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>indifferent,</v>

140
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.790
<v Speaker 2>motivational states and they can change </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of internal transformations.</v>

141
00:08:24.791 --> 00:08:27.370
<v Speaker 2>You're not hungry or thirsty or you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not thirsty.</v>

142
00:08:27.371 --> 00:08:28.204
<v Speaker 2>You're interested in someone or somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>is telling you a story and then you </v>

143
00:08:31.121 --> 00:08:35.170
<v Speaker 2>adopt their motivational framework and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see the world through their eyes</v>

144
00:08:35.171 --> 00:08:38.350
<v Speaker 2>and now we know what the neural </v>
<v Speaker 2>machinery for that and we already talked</v>

145
00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:39.184
<v Speaker 2>about that so we can toss back and forth</v>
<v Speaker 2>these motivational rains that frames of </v>

146
00:08:42.911 --> 00:08:45.520
<v Speaker 2>reference and that gives us insight into</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone else's world.</v>

147
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.073
<v Speaker 2>You can look at the world endless </v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers of ways and what you're trying </v>

148
00:08:50.021 --> 00:08:54.550
<v Speaker 2>to do is out of its infinite richness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

149
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.620
<v Speaker 2>is pull out parts of it that are useful </v>
<v Speaker 2>for you while you're moving from point a</v>

150
00:08:58.621 --> 00:08:59.454
<v Speaker 2>to point b,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this can be a chair if you want to </v>

151
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:02.394
<v Speaker 2>sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you want to take the light bulb </v>

152
00:09:03.301 --> 00:09:04.134
<v Speaker 2>out of the ceiling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's then it's a stool or a table </v>

153
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:11.070
<v Speaker 2>and whether or not it's a chair or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>stool or a table depends just as much on</v>

154
00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:14.370
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing as it does on what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

155
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.193
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's part of the reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>why human beings can be so infinitely </v>

156
00:09:18.421 --> 00:09:19.231
<v Speaker 2>creative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

157
00:09:19.231 --> 00:09:20.670
<v Speaker 2>For us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world isn't fixed.</v>

158
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.710
<v Speaker 2>We never know what it's going to bring </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth,</v>

159
00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:25.500
<v Speaker 2>so 100 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone would have said,</v>

160
00:09:25.501 --> 00:09:29.550
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could build a machine on a wafer,</v>

161
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:30.443
<v Speaker 2>a centimeter square out of sand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you have enough of those </v>

162
00:09:35.131 --> 00:09:35.964
<v Speaker 2>machines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then everyone in the world can be </v>

163
00:09:36.781 --> 00:09:37.614
<v Speaker 2>connected and everyone in the world can </v>
<v Speaker 2>have an infinite library of verbal </v>

164
00:09:40.321 --> 00:09:41.250
<v Speaker 2>material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

165
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.560
<v Speaker 2>That's impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not impossible.</v>

166
00:09:43.561 --> 00:09:48.561
<v Speaker 2>It turns out that Silica has those </v>
<v Speaker 2>properties and we can build unbelievably</v>

167
00:09:50.491 --> 00:09:54.540
<v Speaker 2>powerful machines out of nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so then that kind of makes you think</v>

168
00:09:54.541 --> 00:09:55.374
<v Speaker 2>about just what this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing that we're building things out </v>

169
00:09:57.121 --> 00:09:57.954
<v Speaker 2>of his right because it seems to be able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to reveal a constant array of </v>

170
00:10:02.221 --> 00:10:03.054
<v Speaker 2>properties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Properties that are essentially </v>

171
00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:09.990
<v Speaker 2>unlimited and its capacity to reveal </v>
<v Speaker 2>those properties seems to depend as much</v>

172
00:10:09.991 --> 00:10:12.930
<v Speaker 2>on our ability to interact with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever that is,</v>

173
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:14.003
<v Speaker 2>as it does on whatever the stuff is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we know even from a strict object </v>

174
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:22.423
<v Speaker 2>perception of the world that the stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>that things are made of is a lot more </v>

175
00:10:26.031 --> 00:10:27.950
<v Speaker 2>complicated than we had originally </v>
<v Speaker 2>presumed.</v>

176
00:10:27.951 --> 00:10:32.480
<v Speaker 2>Even as materialists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because materialists realists,</v>

177
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:38.850
<v Speaker 2>their philosophy only holds down to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>subatomic level of analysis.</v>

178
00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:42.580
<v Speaker 2>Deterministic worldview below the </v>
<v Speaker 2>subatomic level of analysis.</v>

179
00:10:42.581 --> 00:10:43.414
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing deterministic at all and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stuff that things are made of is so </v>

180
00:10:46.391 --> 00:10:48.440
<v Speaker 2>mysterious that we can't even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't grasp,</v>

181
00:10:48.441 --> 00:10:49.274
<v Speaker 2>but we can't comprehend it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it turns out that rather than the </v>

182
00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:57.100
<v Speaker 2>story world be being dependent on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>object world,</v>

183
00:10:57.101 --> 00:10:57.934
<v Speaker 2>it might be the other way around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The object world is dependent on the </v>

184
00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:00.784
<v Speaker 2>story world and that implies at least to</v>
<v Speaker 2>some degree that the story world is </v>

185
00:11:03.431 --> 00:11:06.040
<v Speaker 2>actually more real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever that means,</v>

186
00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:08.950
<v Speaker 2>and then I told you that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

187
00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:13.840
<v Speaker 2>the real problem of life isn't so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do when you're around things</v>

188
00:11:13.841 --> 00:11:14.674
<v Speaker 2>that you understand?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real problem of life is what do you </v>

189
00:11:17.921 --> 00:11:21.340
<v Speaker 2>do when you encounter something you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't conceptualize?</v>

190
00:11:21.341 --> 00:11:22.174
<v Speaker 2>And I think a good recent example of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the bombing of the world trade </v>

191
00:11:25.151 --> 00:11:25.984
<v Speaker 2>towers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which people were compelled to watch </v>

192
00:11:27.071 --> 00:11:29.770
<v Speaker 2>over and over and over and over.</v>

193
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:33.010
<v Speaker 2>And if you ask someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what is it that you're watching?</v>

194
00:11:33.011 --> 00:11:33.940
<v Speaker 2>They would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

195
00:11:33.941 --> 00:11:36.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm watching the world trade towers fall</v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

196
00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.170
<v Speaker 2>but then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

197
00:11:38.171 --> 00:11:40.450
<v Speaker 2>why are you watching it over and over </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they would say something like,</v>

198
00:11:40.451 --> 00:11:42.010
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe it.</v>

199
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.250
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe it's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what does that mean?</v>

200
00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.300
<v Speaker 2>It means something like whatever it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's happening here,</v>

201
00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:53.200
<v Speaker 2>whatever's being blown apart exceeds my </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to model.</v>

202
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.153
<v Speaker 2>As a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to expose myself to it again and </v>

203
00:11:55.721 --> 00:11:59.320
<v Speaker 2>again and again and again to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what's falling,</v>

204
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.580
<v Speaker 2>what's falling exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it just the.</v>

205
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.090
<v Speaker 2>Is it just the Towers is at 20,000 </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

206
00:12:04.091 --> 00:12:04.924
<v Speaker 2>is that the financial system of the u?</v>
<v Speaker 2>S is the stability of the Western world </v>

207
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.033
<v Speaker 2>is at the beginning of world war three </v>
<v Speaker 2>or as the former CIA director just </v>

208
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.210
<v Speaker 2>mentioned in theu ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>s the beginning of world war for what is</v>

209
00:12:16.211 --> 00:12:17.044
<v Speaker 2>it exactly that you're looking at when </v>
<v Speaker 2>something happens that you don't </v>

210
00:12:19.001 --> 00:12:19.834
<v Speaker 2>understand</v>

211
00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:25.431
<v Speaker 2>and then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

212
00:12:25.431 --> 00:12:26.264
<v Speaker 2>how do you react to that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it turns out that you react mostly </v>

213
00:12:29.631 --> 00:12:31.400
<v Speaker 2>with your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not with your mind,</v>

214
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:33.800
<v Speaker 2>not with your perceptual systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not with your thoughts,</v>

215
00:12:33.801 --> 00:12:34.634
<v Speaker 2>but with your emotions and your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that means you sweat and you panic </v>

216
00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:43.100
<v Speaker 2>and you feel depressed and you feel hurt</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you feel ashamed and you're prepared</v>

217
00:12:43.101 --> 00:12:43.934
<v Speaker 2>for a catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is stress and all that basically </v>

218
00:12:46.431 --> 00:12:47.264
<v Speaker 2>noncognitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what that means is that when you </v>

219
00:12:49.791 --> 00:12:51.560
<v Speaker 2>encounter something you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>

220
00:12:51.561 --> 00:12:56.561
<v Speaker 2>the first manner in which you conceive </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it is embodied emotional,</v>

221
00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:58.003
<v Speaker 2>physical way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before you develop up an object </v>

222
00:12:59.931 --> 00:13:02.030
<v Speaker 2>representation or cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation,</v>

223
00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.940
<v Speaker 2>you may not ever get it like an event </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

224
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.863
<v Speaker 2>or a worse event can throw someone into </v>
<v Speaker 2>a tailspin that's so extreme that they </v>

225
00:13:10.011 --> 00:13:11.360
<v Speaker 2>never get out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you'll see,</v>

226
00:13:11.361 --> 00:13:12.550
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes,</v>

227
00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.600
<v Speaker 2>and this is more true among elderly </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

228
00:13:14.601 --> 00:13:15.434
<v Speaker 2>if their spouse dies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the probability that they'll die in the </v>

229
00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:19.243
<v Speaker 2>next year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say from a heart attack or something </v>

230
00:13:19.791 --> 00:13:21.770
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>increases substantially.</v>

231
00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:23.083
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because they're conceptual frame </v>

232
00:13:27.381 --> 00:13:30.560
<v Speaker 2>was so dependent on the existence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their spouse.</v>

233
00:13:30.561 --> 00:13:31.394
<v Speaker 2>Say someone they've lived with for 25 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years that the anxiety and uncertainty </v>

234
00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:36.673
<v Speaker 2>caused by their anomalous disappearance </v>
<v Speaker 2>there death is so extreme that it sends </v>

235
00:13:41.451 --> 00:13:42.284
<v Speaker 2>their body into a physiological state </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's basically unbearable and that </v>

236
00:13:44.961 --> 00:13:45.794
<v Speaker 2>does the men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you start to understand what </v>

237
00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.380
<v Speaker 2>having your preconceptions rattled </v>
<v Speaker 2>really means,</v>

238
00:13:51.381 --> 00:13:56.381
<v Speaker 2>then you also start to understand why </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are so motivated to protect their</v>

239
00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:58.880
<v Speaker 2>ideological territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

240
00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:01.430
<v Speaker 2>Because ideological territory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how you see the world.</v>

241
00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.293
<v Speaker 2>That's your story and you can't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>your fundaments rattled all the time </v>

242
00:14:06.711 --> 00:14:10.520
<v Speaker 2>because it throws everything into chaos </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that puts you in this terrible,</v>

243
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:15.550
<v Speaker 2>panicky cortisol written stressful state</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really hard on you physically.</v>

244
00:14:16.071 --> 00:14:16.904
<v Speaker 2>So we know for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you're in a state where you're </v>

245
00:14:19.341 --> 00:14:21.320
<v Speaker 2>chronically exposed to threat or </v>
<v Speaker 2>punishment,</v>

246
00:14:21.321 --> 00:14:24.920
<v Speaker 2>which is the case in depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say you produce a lot of cortisol,</v>

247
00:14:24.921 --> 00:14:27.800
<v Speaker 2>which is a stress hormone and cortisol </v>
<v Speaker 2>is toxic.</v>

248
00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:28.783
<v Speaker 2>So the more of it you produce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you kill off your hippocampal </v>

249
00:14:30.851 --> 00:14:33.920
<v Speaker 2>cells and you really need them because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are key to memory.</v>

250
00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.193
<v Speaker 2>You do in your immunological system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all sorts of negative side </v>

251
00:14:38.361 --> 00:14:39.194
<v Speaker 2>effects of cortisol poisoning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>increased incidents of cardiovascular </v>

252
00:14:41.871 --> 00:14:43.520
<v Speaker 2>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heightened grade of cancer,</v>

253
00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.500
<v Speaker 2>plus it's just no fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

254
00:14:45.501 --> 00:14:47.540
<v Speaker 2>It's the worst thing that can possibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen to you.</v>

255
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.600
<v Speaker 2>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If something I know it happens to you in</v>

256
00:14:50.601 --> 00:14:52.220
<v Speaker 2>blows frame of reference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

257
00:14:52.221 --> 00:14:54.560
<v Speaker 2>knocks you for a loop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sends you to the underworld,</v>

258
00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:55.394
<v Speaker 2>however you want to construe it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really going to upset your </v>

259
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:03.110
<v Speaker 2>bandwagon and throw you into a state </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you do virtually anything to avoid.</v>

260
00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:03.944
<v Speaker 2>But by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a possibility that inside that </v>

261
00:15:07.131 --> 00:15:09.950
<v Speaker 2>chaotic mess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something you really need,</v>

262
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.590
<v Speaker 2>and what's the logic there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

263
00:15:12.591 --> 00:15:15.230
<v Speaker 2>the logic is something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you look at the world,</v>

264
00:15:15.231 --> 00:15:16.064
<v Speaker 2>you only see a fragment of it and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>good because it's pretty overwhelming </v>

265
00:15:18.921 --> 00:15:20.930
<v Speaker 2>and the fragments generally more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>

266
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.393
<v Speaker 2>but all the information that you've ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>gathered in your entire life to build </v>

267
00:15:26.121 --> 00:15:30.350
<v Speaker 2>yourself out of and to make your life </v>
<v Speaker 2>stable has come as a consequence of your</v>

268
00:15:30.351 --> 00:15:33.230
<v Speaker 2>ability to explore what you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>

269
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:36.110
<v Speaker 2>and that's an unlimited capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

270
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:39.560
<v Speaker 2>No matter how much you explored,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much information you gather,</v>

271
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:40.753
<v Speaker 2>there's always the possibility that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's way more information out there </v>

272
00:15:43.251 --> 00:15:46.730
<v Speaker 2>and that means if you have a problem and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see that it's a problem,</v>

273
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:47.683
<v Speaker 2>even though that's frightening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also a gateway into a domain of </v>

274
00:15:51.081 --> 00:15:56.081
<v Speaker 2>possibility and the possibility is this </v>
<v Speaker 2>richly informative background that could</v>

275
00:15:56.211 --> 00:15:58.910
<v Speaker 2>in principle provide you with any answer</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need,</v>

276
00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.490
<v Speaker 2>but and then you can take one more </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

277
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:06.710
<v Speaker 2>The old Gods Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say the God of war,</v>

278
00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.030
<v Speaker 2>Venus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the god of love,</v>

279
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:10.850
<v Speaker 2>they're all internalized for us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

280
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.500
<v Speaker 2>We know that angers the psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>state and that love is the psychological</v>

281
00:16:15.501 --> 00:16:16.334
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if we look at our great religious </v>

282
00:16:18.291 --> 00:16:21.890
<v Speaker 2>traditions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity say or Buddhism,</v>

283
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:22.993
<v Speaker 2>just to take two as an example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we still have this notion that what </v>

284
00:16:25.941 --> 00:16:29.720
<v Speaker 2>these figures represent is something </v>
<v Speaker 2>external.</v>

285
00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might say how primitive,</v>

286
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.273
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

287
00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:38.270
<v Speaker 2>Just as primitive as the idea that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>god of war is something external,</v>

288
00:16:38.271 --> 00:16:41.420
<v Speaker 2>is the idea that this sort of figure is </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be something external.</v>

289
00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.780
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to be something embodied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

290
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:49.550
<v Speaker 2>It's a story about the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual moral responsibility.</v>

291
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:53.270
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is something like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

292
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:55.243
<v Speaker 2>reality itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the existence of things seems to depend </v>

293
00:16:59.090 --> 00:16:59.923
<v Speaker 2>on the existence of a finite observer so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we can see things from a </v>

294
00:17:02.781 --> 00:17:03.614
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't see things from a </v>

295
00:17:04.641 --> 00:17:06.410
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything is the same.</v>

296
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:07.333
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing delineated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if there's going to be delineated </v>

297
00:17:10.731 --> 00:17:12.470
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>small things,</v>

298
00:17:12.471 --> 00:17:13.304
<v Speaker 2>insufficient things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're going to be aware they're </v>

299
00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:18.770
<v Speaker 2>going to be vulnerable as a part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their limitation.</v>

300
00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:19.940
<v Speaker 2>And so you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

301
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:22.303
<v Speaker 2>limitation is a precondition for being </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that means suffering is part and </v>

302
00:17:24.981 --> 00:17:25.940
<v Speaker 2>parcel of being.</v>

303
00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:32.390
<v Speaker 2>Dostoevsky said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly,</v>

304
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:34.970
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you all the cake you want.</v>

305
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.460
<v Speaker 2>You got a big house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got nothing to do,</v>

306
00:17:37.461 --> 00:17:39.020
<v Speaker 2>but watch TV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

307
00:17:39.021 --> 00:17:41.780
<v Speaker 2>And propagate the species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you happy?</v>

308
00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.340
<v Speaker 2>Dostoevsky says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

309
00:17:43.341 --> 00:17:44.174
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

310
00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:45.133
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because human beings are really </v>

311
00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:49.440
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ungrateful and insane,</v>

312
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:50.453
<v Speaker 2>so if you give them some little </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable niche to occupy themselves </v>

313
00:17:53.131 --> 00:17:54.600
<v Speaker 2>with so they don't have anything to </v>
<v Speaker 2>worry about,</v>

314
00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.970
<v Speaker 2>the first thing they're going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like Adam and eve,</v>

315
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:57.833
<v Speaker 2>basically are just like Gautama Buddha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to run around looking for </v>

316
00:18:01.021 --> 00:18:03.450
<v Speaker 2>the apple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for the snake.</v>

317
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:06.420
<v Speaker 2>Looking for the trouble to smash the </v>
<v Speaker 2>frame into bits,</v>

318
00:18:06.421 --> 00:18:07.254
<v Speaker 2>no matter how comfortable it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just so they can get access to little </v>

319
00:18:09.811 --> 00:18:12.600
<v Speaker 2>chaos and have some fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so then you think,</v>

320
00:18:12.601 --> 00:18:14.910
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's more like the purpose of life</v>

321
00:18:14.911 --> 00:18:17.250
<v Speaker 2>isn't to avoid chaos because we like </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos.</v>

322
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:18.210
<v Speaker 2>It's entertaining,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

323
00:18:18.211 --> 00:18:19.044
<v Speaker 2>It keeps us alert and awake and it gives</v>
<v Speaker 2>us something to do that really has no </v>

324
00:18:22.021 --> 00:18:24.840
<v Speaker 2>end and so maybe the answer is something</v>
<v Speaker 2>more like,</v>

325
00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.780
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget the frame of reference and forget</v>

326
00:18:27.781 --> 00:18:28.614
<v Speaker 2>the chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but hit the balance right between the </v>

327
00:18:30.781 --> 00:18:31.411
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

328
00:18:31.411 --> 00:18:32.244
<v Speaker 2>So that you've got one foot where it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonably comfortable and you've got </v>

329
00:18:34.801 --> 00:18:35.634
<v Speaker 2>one foot out there where it's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>exciting and dangerous and that's </v>

330
00:18:37.861 --> 00:18:40.710
<v Speaker 2>perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you think the state you want to</v>

331
00:18:40.711 --> 00:18:44.430
<v Speaker 2>attain that makes you resistant to even </v>
<v Speaker 2>the greatest anomalies.</v>

332
00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:45.533
<v Speaker 2>Anomalies of death say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or vulnerability or mortality is </v>

333
00:18:47.791 --> 00:18:50.370
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's that position,</v>

334
00:18:50.371 --> 00:18:51.204
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Balance Straight between the forces of </v>

335
00:18:52.891 --> 00:18:53.724
<v Speaker 2>chaos and the forces of order or between</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yin and Yang and how do you know you're </v>

336
00:18:58.171 --> 00:19:00.960
<v Speaker 2>there because that's what it really </v>
<v Speaker 2>boils down to.</v>

337
00:19:00.961 --> 00:19:03.240
<v Speaker 2>How do you know that you were there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you think,</v>

338
00:19:03.241 --> 00:19:04.350
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty simple.</v>

339
00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:10.340
<v Speaker 2>You Watch with your eyes open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like Solzhenitsyn Watch.</v>

340
00:19:10.341 --> 00:19:13.630
<v Speaker 2>Do you think I don't know everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's see what I do.</v>

341
00:19:13.631 --> 00:19:15.370
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no preconceptions.</v>

342
00:19:15.371 --> 00:19:16.204
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to shield myself from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth with some second rate frame of </v>

343
00:19:20.021 --> 00:19:20.854
<v Speaker 2>reference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't believe in those anyways </v>

344
00:19:21.671 --> 00:19:24.610
<v Speaker 2>because they're always fragmental.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to watch.</v>

345
00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:27.820
<v Speaker 2>So when am I not miserable?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you think,</v>

346
00:19:27.821 --> 00:19:29.710
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not miserable when I'm interested in</v>

347
00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:31.690
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get interested in something.</v>

348
00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't exactly know why I get </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in.</v>

349
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:35.830
<v Speaker 2>It catches me.</v>

350
00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:40.743
<v Speaker 2>What are the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the phenomenology of being </v>

351
00:19:42.391 --> 00:19:44.460
<v Speaker 2>caught?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are Not self conscious.</v>

352
00:19:44.461 --> 00:19:47.130
<v Speaker 2>When I'm engaged in something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm more like a child,</v>

353
00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.910
<v Speaker 2>which is why children have intimations </v>
<v Speaker 2>of immortality.</v>

354
00:19:50.911 --> 00:19:51.744
<v Speaker 2>I mean engaged in this process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think about myself so I'm not </v>

355
00:19:55.501 --> 00:19:56.334
<v Speaker 2>self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lose my sense of temporality because </v>

356
00:19:58.741 --> 00:19:59.574
<v Speaker 2>it seems like I can do whatever it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'm doing thing that I enjoy for </v>

357
00:20:02.821 --> 00:20:03.654
<v Speaker 2>hours and the time flies by and I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 2>even really aware of the surrounding </v>

358
00:20:06.541 --> 00:20:11.190
<v Speaker 2>world and none of my existential </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerns are paramount at that time.</v>

359
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:15.180
<v Speaker 2>Every need is suppressed by my </v>
<v Speaker 2>engagement in the activity.</v>

360
00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:16.830
<v Speaker 2>And then you say to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

361
00:20:16.831 --> 00:20:18.860
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find that only happens like you know,</v>

362
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.530
<v Speaker 2>10 minutes every three days or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm being particularly miserable,</v>

363
00:20:22.531 --> 00:20:23.700
<v Speaker 2>but you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

364
00:20:23.701 --> 00:20:26.550
<v Speaker 2>the fact that it happens at all is </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably worth paying attention to.</v>

365
00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you believe that your </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience is real,</v>

366
00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:30.413
<v Speaker 2>like real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you can get into a state </v>

367
00:20:32.371 --> 00:20:33.204
<v Speaker 2>like that at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's worth paying attention to and so </v>

368
00:20:34.411 --> 00:20:35.390
<v Speaker 2>then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's,</v>

369
00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:36.493
<v Speaker 2>that's where your sense of ethics really</v>
<v Speaker 2>starts to arise is what makes you </v>

370
00:20:40.081 --> 00:20:40.891
<v Speaker 2>interested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

371
00:20:40.891 --> 00:20:42.840
<v Speaker 2>it might be just as cracked and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

372
00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:43.853
<v Speaker 2>and peculiar as.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something you could possibly </v>

373
00:20:45.121 --> 00:20:45.954
<v Speaker 2>imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

374
00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:48.280
<v Speaker 2>Your parents are against your friends or</v>
<v Speaker 2>against it.</v>

375
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.860
<v Speaker 2>Even you're against it when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking clearly,</v>

376
00:20:50.861 --> 00:20:51.694
<v Speaker 2>but there's still this reality that </v>
<v Speaker 2>something compels you and then you </v>

377
00:20:55.901 --> 00:20:56.261
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

378
00:20:56.261 --> 00:20:58.660
<v Speaker 2>can you trust it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

379
00:20:58.661 --> 00:21:02.500
<v Speaker 2>well that's a tough question because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>read a long time for a long time,</v>

380
00:21:02.501 --> 00:21:03.334
<v Speaker 2>I read accounts of serial killers </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was really interested in what </v>

381
00:21:07.091 --> 00:21:08.230
<v Speaker 2>motivated them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

382
00:21:08.231 --> 00:21:10.900
<v Speaker 2>And they're an interesting breed in many</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways,</v>

383
00:21:10.901 --> 00:21:13.420
<v Speaker 2>which is why there's such a popular </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascination with them.</v>

384
00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.790
<v Speaker 2>And so then you think about a story like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and you think,</v>

385
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.760
<v Speaker 2>Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you can't trust your interest.</v>

386
00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:20.530
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it'll take you somewhere.</v>

387
00:21:20.531 --> 00:21:23.230
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to go like seriously </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you don't want to go.</v>

388
00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:27.370
<v Speaker 2>How do you know that if you really let </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself be who you could be,</v>

389
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:28.263
<v Speaker 2>that you'd end up somewhere good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then the income to the second </v>

390
00:21:31.091 --> 00:21:32.890
<v Speaker 2>part of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is something like this.</v>

391
00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:35.800
<v Speaker 2>Let's say that you're a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

392
00:21:35.801 --> 00:21:39.670
<v Speaker 2>very finely tuned biological machine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

393
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.990
<v Speaker 2>Kim Do a computer and then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

394
00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:47.470
<v Speaker 2>you take a computer and you feed it </v>
<v Speaker 2>false information.</v>

395
00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:50.950
<v Speaker 2>What do you get out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>False information,</v>

396
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

397
00:21:52.541 --> 00:21:55.750
<v Speaker 2>you've stuck with this computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very complicated.</v>

398
00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:59.560
<v Speaker 2>You kind of reside in it in some manner </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand,</v>

399
00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:00.723
<v Speaker 2>and yet you're prone pawn occasions </v>
<v Speaker 2>either to deny it information </v>

400
00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:05.680
<v Speaker 2>altogether.</v>

401
00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.513
<v Speaker 2>When you walk away from something you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know you shouldn't walk away from or </v>

402
00:22:08.861 --> 00:22:10.510
<v Speaker 2>defeated it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad information,</v>

403
00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.700
<v Speaker 2>and so then what if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if this was the case?</v>

404
00:22:12.701 --> 00:22:13.534
<v Speaker 2>What if it was the case that the systems</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Orient you with regards to your </v>

405
00:22:17.021 --> 00:22:17.854
<v Speaker 2>interest can become pathologized by any </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship you have with yourself </v>

406
00:22:21.821 --> 00:22:25.120
<v Speaker 2>that's predicated on bad faith,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so then you think,</v>

407
00:22:25.121 --> 00:22:25.954
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why there's an ethical aspect to </v>

408
00:22:27.911 --> 00:22:32.410
<v Speaker 2>this redemptive process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a real strenuous and strict ethical</v>

409
00:22:32.411 --> 00:22:33.940
<v Speaker 2>aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes something like this.</v>

410
00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:35.013
<v Speaker 2>There are things that you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Find yourself engaged with the world at </v>

411
00:22:38.591 --> 00:22:43.030
<v Speaker 2>such a level that your existential </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerns could disappear and we can even</v>

412
00:22:43.031 --> 00:22:43.864
<v Speaker 2>understand that biochemically to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree because if you're really </v>

413
00:22:46.001 --> 00:22:46.834
<v Speaker 2>interested in something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a dopamine release and </v>

414
00:22:48.941 --> 00:22:51.730
<v Speaker 2>exploratory dopamine release.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

415
00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's associated with positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>effect with confidence,</v>

416
00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:56.830
<v Speaker 2>with increased immunological </v>
<v Speaker 2>functioning,</v>

417
00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.520
<v Speaker 2>with better memory functioning with </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning everything you want.</v>

418
00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:06.880
<v Speaker 2>It's also potently antianxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lytic and analgesic,</v>

419
00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:07.743
<v Speaker 2>which means that if you're really </v>
<v Speaker 2>pursuing something that's compelling to </v>

420
00:23:10.061 --> 00:23:12.490
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're much more resistant biochemically</v>

421
00:23:12.491 --> 00:23:13.960
<v Speaker 2>to punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disappointment,</v>

422
00:23:13.961 --> 00:23:15.310
<v Speaker 2>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pain,</v>

423
00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.890
<v Speaker 2>threat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc. And it's not because you're blind,</v>

424
00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:20.013
<v Speaker 2>it's not blind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's becAuse your nervous system is </v>

425
00:23:21.581 --> 00:23:24.070
<v Speaker 2>optimally tuned to make you maximally </v>
<v Speaker 2>resistant.</v>

426
00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:27.310
<v Speaker 2>And so then you might think if you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>optimally tuned,</v>

427
00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.490
<v Speaker 2>how resistant would you be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know,</v>

428
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:32.223
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's a spiral that never stops </v>

429
00:23:33.731 --> 00:23:38.720
<v Speaker 2>moving uphill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what the upper end is.</v>

430
00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:43.240
<v Speaker 2>We have exemplars that might indicate </v>
<v Speaker 2>what that upper end could be,</v>

431
00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:46.400
<v Speaker 2>but we don't actually know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you think,</v>

432
00:23:46.401 --> 00:23:47.600
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well here's the,</v>

433
00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.950
<v Speaker 2>here's the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say something like this.</v>

434
00:23:51.951 --> 00:23:53.690
<v Speaker 2>If you looked at the world from this </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

435
00:23:53.691 --> 00:23:55.370
<v Speaker 2>which is something you have to decide if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

436
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find compelling and reasonable.</v>

437
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
<v Speaker 2>The rule is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're always gonna run into anomaly,</v>

438
00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:07.683
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

439
00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:08.121
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

440
00:24:08.121 --> 00:24:10.530
<v Speaker 2>normally it's always going to look to </v>
<v Speaker 2>look to you like,</v>

441
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:14.450
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's no bloody wonder.</v>

442
00:24:14.451 --> 00:24:15.890
<v Speaker 2>You want to run away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

443
00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.230
<v Speaker 2>in some ways is your whole body's </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling you,</v>

444
00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:19.820
<v Speaker 2>watch out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for good reason,</v>

445
00:24:19.821 --> 00:24:20.654
<v Speaker 2>because It's no joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then it was more to the story </v>

446
00:24:22.731 --> 00:24:27.650
<v Speaker 2>because the anomalous thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's everything you don't know and you</v>

447
00:24:27.651 --> 00:24:28.520
<v Speaker 2>might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

448
00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.770
<v Speaker 2>you're going out with someone and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to have a longterm relationship.</v>

449
00:24:30.771 --> 00:24:33.230
<v Speaker 2>They betray you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could there be any good in that?</v>

450
00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.193
<v Speaker 2>Because that certainly what you're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to ask when you first encounter the </v>

451
00:24:38.031 --> 00:24:38.864
<v Speaker 2>unexpected information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you might think could be that </v>

452
00:24:42.231 --> 00:24:44.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little too naive for my own good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

453
00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:46.003
<v Speaker 2>People pull me in a little more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>they should or I'm not sufficiently </v>

454
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.903
<v Speaker 2>careful when I enter into intimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships with people or I don't </v>

455
00:24:52.101 --> 00:24:52.934
<v Speaker 2>treat people right or I don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good conceptualization of myself or I'm </v>

456
00:24:56.511 --> 00:24:57.980
<v Speaker 2>chasing after the wrong person.</v>

457
00:24:58.940 --> 00:24:59.773
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all going to be very annoying to </v>

458
00:25:00.681 --> 00:25:01.970
<v Speaker 2>learn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you don't learn it,</v>

459
00:25:01.971 --> 00:25:02.804
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be in big trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe the best thing to do and then </v>

460
00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:06.830
<v Speaker 2>normally have that sort of hits you this</v>
<v Speaker 2>to think,</v>

461
00:25:06.831 --> 00:25:08.090
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

462
00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:10.700
<v Speaker 2>it's a dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No doubt it will eat me,</v>

463
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:13.970
<v Speaker 2>but if I don't let it eat me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they'll just be another one waiting</v>

464
00:25:13.971 --> 00:25:14.804
<v Speaker 2>around the corner and it will probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>be a little bit bigger and if I get </v>

465
00:25:16.431 --> 00:25:17.264
<v Speaker 2>eaten by enough of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really going to want to be </v>

466
00:25:18.921 --> 00:25:19.754
<v Speaker 2>around much and maybe I'm not going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be willing to help other people be </v>

467
00:25:21.951 --> 00:25:22.784
<v Speaker 2>around much either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem like a very good </v>

468
00:25:24.591 --> 00:25:25.610
<v Speaker 2>alternative to me.</v>

469
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:30.703
<v Speaker 2>Back in 1957,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some new gnostic writings were </v>

470
00:25:34.041 --> 00:25:36.050
<v Speaker 2>discovered in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a cave.</v>

471
00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:38.863
<v Speaker 2>They were discovered by these two arab </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys who went out to kill the man who </v>

472
00:25:43.011 --> 00:25:43.844
<v Speaker 2>killed her father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They took them out into this cave and </v>

473
00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:47.000
<v Speaker 2>they killed them and when they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>burying them,</v>

474
00:25:47.001 --> 00:25:47.834
<v Speaker 2>they found exam for a full of papers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>papyrus and they took them home and </v>

475
00:25:51.831 --> 00:25:52.664
<v Speaker 2>their mother used a bunch of them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>like cooking fires with and one day one </v>

476
00:25:55.701 --> 00:25:59.330
<v Speaker 2>of their friends who is an antiquities </v>
<v Speaker 2>dealer showed up and he said,</v>

477
00:25:59.331 --> 00:26:00.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't be burning those.</v>

478
00:26:00.861 --> 00:26:05.861
<v Speaker 2>Those are about 1500 years old and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>look like very early gnostic gospels.</v>

479
00:26:06.441 --> 00:26:07.274
<v Speaker 2>And the gnostics were this branch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>christianity that was pretty violently </v>

480
00:26:09.711 --> 00:26:10.544
<v Speaker 2>suppressed by the emergence of orthodox </v>
<v Speaker 2>christianity and the gnostics believed </v>

481
00:26:13.911 --> 00:26:17.810
<v Speaker 2>that faith was a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but knowledge was all right too.</v>

482
00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:19.123
<v Speaker 2>And they wrote gospel accounts say of </v>
<v Speaker 2>christ's life that were knowledge </v>

483
00:26:24.741 --> 00:26:27.330
<v Speaker 2>predicated as much as revelation </v>
<v Speaker 2>predicated say,</v>

484
00:26:27.331 --> 00:26:29.660
<v Speaker 2>and this is one of the quotes from one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of those gospels,</v>

485
00:26:29.661 --> 00:26:30.494
<v Speaker 2>the gospel of thomas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is actually one that the only one </v>

486
00:26:32.571 --> 00:26:34.820
<v Speaker 2>that got out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carl Young,</v>

487
00:26:34.821 --> 00:26:38.660
<v Speaker 2>got ahold of him interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is one of the quotes,</v>

488
00:26:38.661 --> 00:26:39.494
<v Speaker 2>and I really liked this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a non canonical saying of </v>

489
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.310
<v Speaker 2>christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the saying is,</v>

490
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:49.940
<v Speaker 2>if you bring forth what is within you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you bring forth will save you.</v>

491
00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:53.340
<v Speaker 2>If you do not bring forth what is within</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

492
00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:57.000
<v Speaker 2>what you do not bring forth will destroy</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

493
00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:03.270
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's a pretty good line to</v>
<v Speaker 2>close off the class.</v>

494
00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:06.870
<v Speaker 2>So thank you for attending.</v>
