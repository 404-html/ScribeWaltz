1
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please join me in welcoming the</v>

2
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.880
<v Speaker 1>disciplines.</v>

3
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.880
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

4
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.200
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I know everybody's really eager to</v>

5
00:00:26.201 --> 00:00:29.710
<v Speaker 3>get into the question resolution at hand</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to hear from our speakers.</v>

6
00:00:29.711 --> 00:00:34.240
<v Speaker 3>So I will just introduce the resolution</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the format people have the legal</v>

7
00:00:34.241 --> 00:00:36.910
<v Speaker 3>right to decide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He resolved that people up the legal</v>

8
00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:41.200
<v Speaker 3>right to decide the pronouns by which</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will be addressed and you'll notice</v>

9
00:00:41.201 --> 00:00:44.480
<v Speaker 3>that we've dropped him disrobe</v>
<v Speaker 3>resolutions that we can discuss the law</v>

10
00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:48.130
<v Speaker 3>as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as it ought to be and various levels of</v>

11
00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:49.210
<v Speaker 3>law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>provincial offices,</v>

12
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.560
<v Speaker 3>rollers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>federal laws.</v>

13
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.750
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we will,</v>

14
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.590
<v Speaker 3>each speaker will speak for 15 minutes</v>
<v Speaker 3>and openings and then they'll have 10</v>

15
00:00:56.591 --> 00:00:59.650
<v Speaker 3>minutes each for bottles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we'll have ample amount of time</v>

16
00:00:59.651 --> 00:01:03.310
<v Speaker 3>for questions and answers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I'm sure many of you have a for</v>

17
00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:05.890
<v Speaker 3>both of our participants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially Dr. Peterson.</v>

18
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.680
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just one quick note about the spirit and</v>

19
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.720
<v Speaker 3>is going to proceed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

20
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.030
<v Speaker 3>we are here gathered as jurists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as officers of the court or future</v>

21
00:01:16.031 --> 00:01:19.660
<v Speaker 3>offers through as of the court in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>spirit of openness and inquiry,</v>

22
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.120
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the laws that we subject ourselves</v>

23
00:01:22.121 --> 00:01:24.280
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the laws that we govern and how they</v>

24
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.530
<v Speaker 3>shape our interactions as society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

25
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.720
<v Speaker 3>so we are proceeding fearlessly and</v>
<v Speaker 3>openly and respectfully.</v>

26
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.430
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so professor party,</v>

27
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.403
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>start.</v>

28
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.600
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's have happening</v>

29
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.960
<v Speaker 2>daily ready</v>

30
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.200
<v Speaker 1>be Queens full for inviting me to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>and putting it on.</v>

31
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is exactly the kind of thing that</v>

32
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.610
<v Speaker 1>running mead was conceived before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

33
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:55.121
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:55.121 --> 00:01:57.520
<v Speaker 1>Nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice job and a hope.</v>

35
00:01:57.521 --> 00:02:00.670
<v Speaker 1>We have a good evening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't hesitate when we get on to the</v>

36
00:02:00.671 --> 00:02:03.760
<v Speaker 1>later stages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the speak up and say your peace.</v>

37
00:02:03.761 --> 00:02:05.260
<v Speaker 1>We're here to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

38
00:02:05.261 --> 00:02:07.300
<v Speaker 1>so don't be shy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you will.</v>

39
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.550
<v Speaker 1>The resolution as stated really as</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joanna mentioned,</v>

40
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.950
<v Speaker 1>raises two questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

41
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.280
<v Speaker 1>what the law actually is as of today and</v>
<v Speaker 1>secondly what the law ought to be.</v>

42
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.540
<v Speaker 1>And I suspect that Professor Peterson</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I might actually agree on the first</v>

43
00:02:28.301 --> 00:02:30.280
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the law is.</v>

44
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.340
<v Speaker 1>I think it's pretty clear that the law</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it exists right now as reflected in</v>

45
00:02:37.841 --> 00:02:42.841
<v Speaker 1>the Ontario human rights code is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is true.</v>

46
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.620
<v Speaker 1>When you're read to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is section one of the Ontario Human</v>

47
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.710
<v Speaker 1>Rights Code.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know you've probably heard this</v>

48
00:02:53.711 --> 00:02:56.050
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every person has a right to equal</v>

49
00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:58.540
<v Speaker 1>treatment with respect to services,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goods at facilities,</v>

50
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.650
<v Speaker 1>and that's been included to include</v>
<v Speaker 1>education at the post secondary level</v>

51
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.480
<v Speaker 1>without discrimination because of an a</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole bunch of numerated items including</v>

52
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.780
<v Speaker 1>gender identity and gender expression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it doesn't talk about pronouns per</v>

53
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:18.961
<v Speaker 1>se in the statute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but according to the Human Rights</v>

54
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 1>Commission of Ontario,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing it should include and</v>

55
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:26.230
<v Speaker 1>there are decisions of tribunals</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially I haven't BC,</v>

56
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not directly on the point in the</v>

57
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 1>classroom about the pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but enough to suggest that that's a</v>

58
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 1>logical extension of the proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In section one,</v>

59
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.350
<v Speaker 1>the more interesting question is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the law is but what it ought to be.</v>

60
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not that state of the law is</v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

61
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.740
<v Speaker 1>something that we should approve them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm here to argue in the affirmative</v>

62
00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 1>that that's exactly the way it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be.</v>

63
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go with these through these</v>
<v Speaker 1>essential five points to make my cases.</v>

64
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.680
<v Speaker 1>They're talking about free speech first</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then about free speech in</v>

65
00:04:09.681 --> 00:04:14.590
<v Speaker 1>classrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nature of gender privacy questions</v>

66
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.730
<v Speaker 1>and then the nature of language itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

67
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.170
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about free speech because</v>

68
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.400
<v Speaker 1>this question is often framed in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>context of two opposing forces,</v>

69
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.340
<v Speaker 1>one being free speech and liberty on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>one hand and on the other sort of a,</v>

70
00:04:32.341 --> 00:04:35.740
<v Speaker 1>a tyrannical government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a social justice warriors trying to shut</v>

71
00:04:35.741 --> 00:04:39.490
<v Speaker 1>down the ability of individuals to speak</v>
<v Speaker 1>for themselves,</v>

72
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.270
<v Speaker 1>and I want to suggest to you that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually an artificial dichotomy.</v>

73
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.890
<v Speaker 1>Let me put it to you this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There actually is no such thing as free</v>

74
00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:53.524
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>

75
00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.510
<v Speaker 1>What I mean by that is that the law is</v>
<v Speaker 1>full of limits on speech.</v>

76
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let us count the ways.</v>

77
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.000
<v Speaker 1>Speech is limited by the law of</v>
<v Speaker 1>defamation.</v>

78
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.970
<v Speaker 1>You can't go off and talk about your</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighbor in the repertory terms.</v>

79
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.140
<v Speaker 1>If it's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be sued.</v>

80
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.430
<v Speaker 1>Speech is limited by the law of</v>
<v Speaker 1>negligence.</v>

81
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.970
<v Speaker 1>You can't yell fire in a crowded theater</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there isn't one,</v>

82
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.790
<v Speaker 1>you'll be held liable for injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We even have a tort called the</v>

83
00:05:33.221 --> 00:05:36.040
<v Speaker 1>intentional infliction of emotional</v>
<v Speaker 1>harm.</v>

84
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.800
<v Speaker 1>That harm being afflicted most of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time by speech.</v>

85
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.660
<v Speaker 1>Speech is regulated and limited by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>criminal law.</v>

86
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.650
<v Speaker 1>We have laws that prohibit counseling a</v>
<v Speaker 1>crime suggesting to somebody or</v>

87
00:05:54.701 --> 00:05:57.740
<v Speaker 1>arranging for somebody to go off and</v>
<v Speaker 1>commit a crime.</v>

88
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Even if all you've done is speak words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have laws that prohibit hate speech,</v>

89
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.290
<v Speaker 1>which is nothing more than speech.</v>

90
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
<v Speaker 1>We even have restrictions of speech in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the area as minor as consumer law</v>

91
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.460
<v Speaker 1>restrictions on advertising where and</v>
<v Speaker 1>when and what it can say.</v>

92
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.240
<v Speaker 1>The proposition is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is not a general rule that speech is</v>

93
00:06:26.271 --> 00:06:30.710
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we have is a starting point of</v>

94
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.770
<v Speaker 1>freedom of expression in the charter and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we have reasonable limits as</v>

95
00:06:36.171 --> 00:06:41.171
<v Speaker 1>defined by societal needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the question is not whether or not</v>

96
00:06:42.141 --> 00:06:45.320
<v Speaker 1>this speech is free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's whether or not those limits are</v>

97
00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:50.180
<v Speaker 1>reasonable and the reasonableness of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>limits can be defined by whether or not</v>

98
00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:52.580
<v Speaker 1>they achieve a common good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

99
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.390
<v Speaker 1>so let's get off this black and white</v>
<v Speaker 1>and go.</v>

100
00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:00.320
<v Speaker 1>This is a matter of gray and in the gray</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

101
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.700
<v Speaker 1>I hope you'll agree with me that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>gray favors this kind of outcome.</v>

102
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.910
<v Speaker 1>So on the point number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking here about the ability of</v>

103
00:07:10.911 --> 00:07:15.200
<v Speaker 1>somebody to decide the programs by which</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will be addressed.</v>

104
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.890
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a general proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but our particular focus is of course</v>

105
00:07:18.891 --> 00:07:21.620
<v Speaker 1>the classroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a student of the boss and the</v>

106
00:07:21.621 --> 00:07:26.030
<v Speaker 1>teacher and the teacher refers to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>person that's came over her and that</v>

107
00:07:26.031 --> 00:07:26.721
<v Speaker 1>person says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

108
00:07:26.721 --> 00:07:29.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be thought of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be referred to as a him</v>

109
00:07:29.871 --> 00:07:32.060
<v Speaker 1>or her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want something to be gender neutral.</v>

110
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.730
<v Speaker 1>A third thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you like</v>

111
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:41.440
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is speech more free or less free in</v>

112
00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:47.750
<v Speaker 1>classrooms than it is on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've suggested those various</v>

113
00:07:47.751 --> 00:07:52.751
<v Speaker 1>restrictions that exist in the law in</v>
<v Speaker 1>general in the classroom.</v>

114
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.840
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to suggest that speech is even</v>
<v Speaker 1>more restraint because there are</v>

115
00:07:58.881 --> 00:08:03.110
<v Speaker 1>obligations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are relationships between teacher</v>

116
00:08:03.111 --> 00:08:06.350
<v Speaker 1>and students and between students and</v>
<v Speaker 1>institution.</v>

117
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.470
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't speak to this question</v>

118
00:08:09.471 --> 00:08:12.710
<v Speaker 1>specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just by way of example to show you</v>

119
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.820
<v Speaker 1>to illustrate that there are more</v>
<v Speaker 1>restrictions on speech.</v>

120
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.950
<v Speaker 1>How would you feel if you're in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>classroom,</v>

121
00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:24.170
<v Speaker 1>you started off the semester and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>professor in question would refused to</v>

122
00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:28.670
<v Speaker 1>refer to you by anything other than you</v>
<v Speaker 1>slimy weasel.</v>

123
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Now don't you think you would have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>complaint?</v>

124
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:39.890
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not even based on kind of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>human rights code,</v>

125
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:42.830
<v Speaker 1>but just on pure administrative law</v>
<v Speaker 1>principles.</v>

126
00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:48.220
<v Speaker 1>Those principles suggest that a teacher</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a classroom has at least a minimum of</v>

127
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:54.200
<v Speaker 1>the responsibility to be unbiased,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to apply an even hand.</v>

128
00:08:55.470 --> 00:09:00.270
<v Speaker 1>And if through language that even hand</v>
<v Speaker 1>is clearly not being addressed,</v>

129
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>express,</v>

130
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.520
<v Speaker 1>then I would have saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is some kind of legal remedy</v>

131
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.990
<v Speaker 1>insight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are lots of other examples both in</v>

132
00:09:09.991 --> 00:09:13.230
<v Speaker 1>the classroom and outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you have earned a phd</v>

133
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.760
<v Speaker 1>and a person in authority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps it's the teacher.</v>

134
00:09:17.761 --> 00:09:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an official,</v>

135
00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.860
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really matter who it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in some kind of official capacity</v>

136
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:28.020
<v Speaker 1>refuses will not call you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doctor wants to call you,</v>

137
00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:31.530
<v Speaker 1>Mr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is actually not the title that</v>

138
00:09:31.531 --> 00:09:36.531
<v Speaker 1>you've earned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you're a woman and you are not</v>

139
00:09:37.921 --> 00:09:42.921
<v Speaker 1>married and the teacher insists upon</v>
<v Speaker 1>calling you miss and you want to be</v>

140
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.890
<v Speaker 1>called Ms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the neutral form.</v>

141
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once upon a time we were having the same</v>

142
00:09:50.761 --> 00:09:55.761
<v Speaker 1>debate about myth</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman wanting to be called ms and the</v>

143
00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:59.980
<v Speaker 1>powers that be back at that time said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

144
00:09:59.981 --> 00:10:01.570
<v Speaker 1>there's only two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's Mrs or miss.</v>

145
00:10:01.571 --> 00:10:04.000
<v Speaker 1>Choose one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we are again.</v>

146
00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:08.170
<v Speaker 1>We have to choose one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually there is a third choice.</v>

147
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.810
<v Speaker 1>I want to suggest that there are also</v>
<v Speaker 1>examples.</v>

148
00:10:18.811 --> 00:10:23.811
<v Speaker 1>You will here to object to this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you raise a false equivalency?</v>

149
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:30.030
<v Speaker 1>This does not say anybody has the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>to insist upon being called anything</v>

150
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.160
<v Speaker 1>because you can think of examples where</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just don't do so.</v>

151
00:10:35.161 --> 00:10:37.080
<v Speaker 1>If I had a student in my classroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

152
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:40.680
<v Speaker 1>professor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like you here for and from now</v>

153
00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:42.810
<v Speaker 1>on to police to refer to me as Your</v>
<v Speaker 1>Majesty.</v>

154
00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:45.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do that.</v>

155
00:10:45.841 --> 00:10:49.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry because objectively speaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are not wealthy unless you can show</v>

156
00:10:49.951 --> 00:10:52.260
<v Speaker 1>me your crown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

157
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:56.820
<v Speaker 1>so the question is not as broad as that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is actually very narrow and</v>

158
00:10:56.821 --> 00:11:00.030
<v Speaker 1>limited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's limited to the question of the</v>

159
00:11:00.031 --> 00:11:05.031
<v Speaker 1>proper pronoun to be used for a person</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is gender neutral,</v>

160
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.810
<v Speaker 1>which brings me to point number three</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is the nature of gender.</v>

161
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:15.350
<v Speaker 1>I want to distinguish between two</v>
<v Speaker 1>related but different ideas and those</v>

162
00:11:16.291 --> 00:11:21.291
<v Speaker 1>two ideas are gender and sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

163
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:24.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a biologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a psychologist,</v>

164
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Emphasis on being the word justice,</v>

165
00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:35.270
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to suggest to you that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>two ideas can be distinguished this way.</v>

166
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Sex being the bio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological idea and gender being the</v>

167
00:11:43.261 --> 00:11:44.094
<v Speaker 1>cultural idea,</v>

168
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.390
<v Speaker 1>you might be able to determine</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody's sex by looking at objective</v>

169
00:11:51.391 --> 00:11:53.410
<v Speaker 1>factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not,</v>

170
00:11:53.411 --> 00:11:54.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to,</v>

171
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:59.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to entertain that possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure you can do the same thing</v>

172
00:12:00.041 --> 00:12:04.010
<v Speaker 1>for gender because gender is an</v>
<v Speaker 1>inherently subjective thing.</v>

173
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.520
<v Speaker 1>Unlike whether or not somebody qualifies</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the title,</v>

174
00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Your Majesty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have thought that whether or not</v>

175
00:12:13.541 --> 00:12:18.541
<v Speaker 1>you are a male or a female or a neither</v>
<v Speaker 1>in gender terms is something only you</v>

176
00:12:20.141 --> 00:12:20.974
<v Speaker 1>can tell us.</v>

177
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:23.983
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

178
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:29.250
<v Speaker 1>So I think that distinguishes the</v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective questions from the object of</v>

179
00:12:29.251 --> 00:12:31.230
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you had a subjective</v>

180
00:12:31.231 --> 00:12:35.280
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the choice has to be determined by</v>

181
00:12:35.281 --> 00:12:37.260
<v Speaker 1>the person who was being addressed.</v>

182
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.570
<v Speaker 4>So on to privacy,</v>

183
00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:54.940
<v Speaker 1>our insistence upon a binary choice that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he or she in a sense reflects our need</v>

184
00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:04.060
<v Speaker 1>to categorize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the strange thing about that need is</v>

185
00:13:04.311 --> 00:13:09.170
<v Speaker 1>that it is based upon information that</v>
<v Speaker 1>really is very personal.</v>

186
00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:12.020
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much of the time you can tell through</v>

187
00:13:12.021 --> 00:13:15.680
<v Speaker 1>outward appearance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you look at the bottom line,</v>

188
00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:19.340
<v Speaker 1>what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you actually need,</v>

189
00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:24.640
<v Speaker 1>I think to insist upon that choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aren't you really asking after all at</v>

190
00:13:26.781 --> 00:13:31.100
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of it all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're insisting to know what that</v>

191
00:13:31.101 --> 00:13:36.101
<v Speaker 1>person's junk looks like</v>
<v Speaker 1>and really nobody else's business.</v>

192
00:13:39.351 --> 00:13:44.351
<v Speaker 1>But Yours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you refuse to indicate with the junk</v>

193
00:13:46.341 --> 00:13:48.860
<v Speaker 1>is life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>

194
00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:51.170
<v Speaker 1>and it's not clear on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the face of things,</v>

195
00:13:51.171 --> 00:13:54.590
<v Speaker 1>and I use that word on purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which way you're going to go,</v>

196
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.330
<v Speaker 1>why should the world care?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really all about you.</v>

197
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just trying to categorize.</v>

198
00:14:02.071 --> 00:14:03.750
<v Speaker 1>I want to see if your one thing or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other thing,</v>

199
00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:08.610
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter what you are and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact it doesn't matter so much that you</v>

200
00:14:08.611 --> 00:14:10.860
<v Speaker 1>might be a third thing or somewhere in</v>
<v Speaker 1>between.</v>

201
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:18.580
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody has the right to pry to obtain</v>

202
00:14:18.581 --> 00:14:23.170
<v Speaker 1>the information necessary to make the</v>
<v Speaker 1>choice between he or she.</v>

203
00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:24.783
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

204
00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.150
<v Speaker 1>and so finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about language because this</v>

205
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:37.160
<v Speaker 1>after all is about like we may in fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>be talking about a peculiar</v>

206
00:14:39.511 --> 00:14:44.511
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of the English language</v>
<v Speaker 1>because as of right now the English</v>

207
00:14:44.911 --> 00:14:49.911
<v Speaker 1>language has just two personal pronouns</v>
<v Speaker 1>but can be used for human beings.</v>

208
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.690
<v Speaker 1>We have a third one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called yet,</v>

209
00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.230
<v Speaker 1>but this doesn't fit very well when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to talk about it.</v>

210
00:14:56.231 --> 00:15:00.680
<v Speaker 1>He moved there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The English language is not unique in</v>

211
00:15:00.681 --> 00:15:01.431
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not,</v>

212
00:15:01.431 --> 00:15:05.780
<v Speaker 1>nor is it universal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are other languages that do have</v>

213
00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:11.120
<v Speaker 1>either a neutral third choice or are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>gendered in the first place.</v>

214
00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:19.240
<v Speaker 1>One might be inclined to resolve this</v>
<v Speaker 1>debate by looking through the dictionary</v>

215
00:15:19.311 --> 00:15:20.930
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm sorry,</v>

216
00:15:20.931 --> 00:15:23.060
<v Speaker 1>there's only two in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no third,</v>

217
00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.660
<v Speaker 1>the third that you want me to use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't find.</v>

218
00:15:26.661 --> 00:15:29.480
<v Speaker 1>And therefore it's not part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>language and therefore I'm not going to</v>

219
00:15:29.481 --> 00:15:33.380
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing about language,</v>

220
00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:38.890
<v Speaker 1>both English and all the others is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially evolutionary changes over</v>

221
00:15:42.201 --> 00:15:45.620
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look in the dictionary today</v>

222
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:51.370
<v Speaker 1>and don't find that third thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look again in a year and two years,</v>

223
00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.940
<v Speaker 1>in five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be there.</v>

224
00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:02.480
<v Speaker 1>So the fact of its absence at the moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>is really not determinative of anything.</v>

225
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:07.940
<v Speaker 1>It's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We might as well be ahead of the curve</v>

226
00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:12.840
<v Speaker 4>then behind</v>
<v Speaker 4>and with that I'll give it the song.</v>

227
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:47.203
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

228
00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.850
<v Speaker 5>So one of the things that I don't like</v>
<v Speaker 5>to do in the discussion,</v>

229
00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:56.620
<v Speaker 5>and I suppose this is part of the whole</v>
<v Speaker 5>problem,</v>

230
00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.540
<v Speaker 5>is I don't like to see linguistic</v>
<v Speaker 5>territory to the people with whom I</v>

231
00:17:00.541 --> 00:17:03.510
<v Speaker 5>disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's actually part of the reason</v>

232
00:17:03.511 --> 00:17:07.860
<v Speaker 5>why I have refused,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>

233
00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:13.160
<v Speaker 5>to use a set of pronouns</v>
<v Speaker 5>that I believe are every believe the use</v>

234
00:17:15.691 --> 00:17:18.990
<v Speaker 5>of them is irrelevant in some sense to</v>
<v Speaker 5>this particular issue because I actually</v>

235
00:17:18.991 --> 00:17:21.510
<v Speaker 5>think the issue is quite a bit deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

236
00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:23.183
<v Speaker 5>just</v>

237
00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:30.430
<v Speaker 5>and so part of my objection to using</v>
<v Speaker 5>those particular pronouns was the lack</v>

238
00:17:30.471 --> 00:17:35.471
<v Speaker 5>of my desire to seed linguistic ground</v>
<v Speaker 5>to people whose political,</v>

239
00:17:35.781 --> 00:17:40.100
<v Speaker 5>philosophical,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and even deeper moral stances I do not</v>

240
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:44.420
<v Speaker 5>agree with in the slightest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And as soon as you see linguistic ground</v>

241
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:49.380
<v Speaker 5>to your last call them adversaries,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have decided that you're going to</v>

242
00:17:49.381 --> 00:17:53.910
<v Speaker 5>play a game within the rules that they</v>
<v Speaker 5>have established and therefore you lose.</v>

243
00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:59.540
<v Speaker 5>So that's why I'm taking the objection</v>
<v Speaker 5>to some degree to the way that this is</v>

244
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.460
<v Speaker 5>formulated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because it isn't really about the right</v>

245
00:18:02.461 --> 00:18:07.461
<v Speaker 5>to decide.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's about the right to insist upon by</v>

246
00:18:08.011 --> 00:18:10.170
<v Speaker 5>force.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you might say,</v>

247
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.710
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what constitutes force?</v>

248
00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:16.720
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I debated Brenda Cossman a lawyer and</v>

249
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:21.630
<v Speaker 5>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I had made the claim,</v>

250
00:18:21.631 --> 00:18:26.100
<v Speaker 5>let's say that you can be jailed for not</v>
<v Speaker 5>using this particular category of</v>

251
00:18:26.101 --> 00:18:30.390
<v Speaker 5>pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which we've already agreed is enshrined</v>

252
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:31.680
<v Speaker 5>the necessity for doing so.</v>

253
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.750
<v Speaker 5>It was already in tried within the</v>
<v Speaker 5>current legislation.</v>

254
00:18:33.751 --> 00:18:37.380
<v Speaker 5>So I'm glad that you agreed upon that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And she basically insisted that</v>

255
00:18:37.381 --> 00:18:41.760
<v Speaker 5>according to the surrounding policies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you couldn't be jailed for that they</v>

256
00:18:41.761 --> 00:18:43.590
<v Speaker 5>could just take away everything you</v>
<v Speaker 5>owned.</v>

257
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:46.020
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I thought that was extremely</v>

258
00:18:46.021 --> 00:18:49.350
<v Speaker 5>interesting first of all because she</v>
<v Speaker 5>seemed to think that that was all right,</v>

259
00:18:49.351 --> 00:18:52.710
<v Speaker 5>but also because she didn't actually</v>
<v Speaker 5>notice that that was kind of the point</v>

260
00:18:52.711 --> 00:18:56.670
<v Speaker 5>that I was making.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Plus if you don't agree or act out the,</v>

261
00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:58.230
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what would you call it?</v>

262
00:18:58.231 --> 00:19:00.780
<v Speaker 5>The judgement of the human rights</v>
<v Speaker 5>tribunal,</v>

263
00:19:00.781 --> 00:19:03.780
<v Speaker 5>then they can take you to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe it's Ontario Superior Court</v>

264
00:19:03.781 --> 00:19:06.390
<v Speaker 5>where they can nail you for captain then</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they can put you in jail.</v>

265
00:19:06.391 --> 00:19:07.320
<v Speaker 5>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

266
00:19:07.321 --> 00:19:08.490
<v Speaker 5>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

267
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.250
<v Speaker 5>it's a nuance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>

268
00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:13.200
<v Speaker 5>it's a non,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a nontrivial direct route and</v>

269
00:19:13.201 --> 00:19:15.270
<v Speaker 5>people have in fact been jailed for such</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

270
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:18.510
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so let's get to the insist upon by force</v>

271
00:19:18.511 --> 00:19:22.740
<v Speaker 5>issue here because that's where the the</v>
<v Speaker 5>issue and that's the way that this</v>

272
00:19:22.741 --> 00:19:25.920
<v Speaker 5>should be formulated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so well we could also,</v>

273
00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:30.240
<v Speaker 5>there's another problem here too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the problem is,</v>

274
00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:34.440
<v Speaker 5>well which pronouns exactly and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>might say,</v>

275
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:39.470
<v Speaker 5>well I'm transsexual male to female to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be addressed as she and the reverse as</v>

276
00:19:41.671 --> 00:19:43.920
<v Speaker 5>he and in fact most transsexuals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in fact,</v>

277
00:19:43.921 --> 00:19:48.810
<v Speaker 5>the overwhelming majority of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are about maybe 0.3% of the</v>

278
00:19:48.811 --> 00:19:50.820
<v Speaker 5>population to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I would estimate,</v>

279
00:19:50.821 --> 00:19:54.000
<v Speaker 5>although I don't know for sure that it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>99% of them,</v>

280
00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.530
<v Speaker 5>but no one really knows actually want to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be addressed by he or she.</v>

281
00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:00.360
<v Speaker 5>They just want to be addressed by the</v>
<v Speaker 5>other one.</v>

282
00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.180
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's a tiny minority the size of</v>

283
00:20:03.181 --> 00:20:07.860
<v Speaker 5>which no one knows who insists that that</v>
<v Speaker 5>particular categorizing categorization</v>

284
00:20:07.861 --> 00:20:09.450
<v Speaker 5>scheme,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't apply to them.</v>

285
00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:11.910
<v Speaker 5>So the question then is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which one does,</v>

286
00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:15.270
<v Speaker 5>and the problem with that is that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>cannot actually answer that question.</v>

287
00:20:15.271 --> 00:20:16.110
<v Speaker 5>And I can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can,</v>

288
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:19.590
<v Speaker 5>I can give you a hint about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>With regards to the ever lengthening,</v>

289
00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:23.280
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>acronym used by the lgbt community to</v>

290
00:20:23.281 --> 00:20:26.940
<v Speaker 5>describe those who are marginalized,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you may notice that every year there's</v>

291
00:20:26.941 --> 00:20:31.941
<v Speaker 5>an additional initial in that acronym.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the reason for that is that the</v>

292
00:20:32.401 --> 00:20:37.401
<v Speaker 5>potential number of identities will</v>
<v Speaker 5>multiply until it fraction down to the</v>

293
00:20:39.031 --> 00:20:44.031
<v Speaker 5>level of the individual itself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It has to because you're not a group,</v>

294
00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:47.350
<v Speaker 5>you're not a member of a group.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're the simultaneous member of</v>

295
00:20:47.351 --> 00:20:48.820
<v Speaker 5>multiple groups.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

296
00:20:48.821 --> 00:20:51.250
<v Speaker 5>so many groups that they can't even be a</v>
<v Speaker 5>numerated.</v>

297
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:56.800
<v Speaker 5>And if my linguistic usage is predicated</v>
<v Speaker 5>on recognizing all of those identities</v>

298
00:20:56.801 --> 00:21:00.340
<v Speaker 5>while we might as well just go home now</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I don't have time to come up</v>

299
00:21:00.341 --> 00:21:03.010
<v Speaker 5>with a million different descriptive</v>
<v Speaker 5>pronouns,</v>

300
00:21:03.011 --> 00:21:06.280
<v Speaker 5>that property going or less evolved the</v>
<v Speaker 5>free market.</v>

301
00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:09.850
<v Speaker 5>Because one of the things the free</v>
<v Speaker 5>market does is enable you to recognize</v>

302
00:21:09.851 --> 00:21:14.851
<v Speaker 5>your multi-dimensional exist and say and</v>
<v Speaker 5>mind simultaneously using mutually</v>

303
00:21:16.331 --> 00:21:20.230
<v Speaker 5>agreed upon price as the determinant</v>
<v Speaker 5>that takes all of those factors</v>

304
00:21:20.231 --> 00:21:24.180
<v Speaker 5>simultaneously into account.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And actually on a pure computational</v>

305
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:26.230
<v Speaker 5>level,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there isn't any other solution to that</v>

306
00:21:26.231 --> 00:21:28.570
<v Speaker 5>problem because it's actually in</v>
<v Speaker 5>computable.</v>

307
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:32.650
<v Speaker 5>So the Pronoun problem becomes very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very problematic,</v>

308
00:21:32.651 --> 00:21:33.760
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very rapidly.</v>

309
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:37.450
<v Speaker 5>You can see that with the acronym growth</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the lgbt community,</v>

310
00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.970
<v Speaker 5>which will,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which has to fractioning.</v>

311
00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:44.500
<v Speaker 5>We'll continue the fractured because</v>
<v Speaker 5>none of those groups are homogenous in,</v>

312
00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:49.540
<v Speaker 5>in any but the most trivial of senses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's a big problem.</v>

313
00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:51.970
<v Speaker 5>Which pronouns?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

314
00:21:51.971 --> 00:21:54.430
<v Speaker 5>so what sort of problem is that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

315
00:21:55.660 --> 00:22:00.250
<v Speaker 5>in New York state for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've already more or less passed into</v>

316
00:22:00.251 --> 00:22:04.840
<v Speaker 5>law the proposition that there are</v>
<v Speaker 5>pretty much as many pronoun descriptors</v>

317
00:22:04.841 --> 00:22:06.970
<v Speaker 5>as there are people claiming identities.</v>

318
00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:11.230
<v Speaker 5>And so on facebook for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is a good example of saint common</v>

319
00:22:11.231 --> 00:22:13.990
<v Speaker 5>parlance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's about 71 different gender</v>

320
00:22:13.991 --> 00:22:18.280
<v Speaker 5>identities already recognize and no</v>
<v Speaker 5>agreed upon lexicon to represent any of</v>

321
00:22:18.281 --> 00:22:20.980
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so the issue there is,</v>

322
00:22:20.981 --> 00:22:23.440
<v Speaker 5>well what stops the infinite</v>
<v Speaker 5>multiplication?</v>

323
00:22:23.441 --> 00:22:26.860
<v Speaker 5>And the answer to that is wim.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's actually written into the law</v>

324
00:22:26.861 --> 00:22:30.790
<v Speaker 5>because the law already states that your</v>
<v Speaker 5>identity is predicated on your</v>

325
00:22:30.791 --> 00:22:34.120
<v Speaker 5>subjective and I would say whim and</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's also wrong.</v>

326
00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:38.710
<v Speaker 5>It isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I was watching Louis C k and the</v>

327
00:22:38.711 --> 00:22:43.711
<v Speaker 5>other night and you know he's a great</v>
<v Speaker 5>philosopher and he said if you,</v>

328
00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:49.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry I don't normally use profanity</v>
<v Speaker 5>but Louis C K does and I am quoting him,</v>

329
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:52.840
<v Speaker 5>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well if you call someone an asshole they</v>

330
00:22:52.841 --> 00:22:55.480
<v Speaker 5>can't actually object because it's not</v>
<v Speaker 5>up to them.</v>

331
00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:01.300
<v Speaker 5>It's up to someone else to determine if</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the case because that that</v>

332
00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:06.280
<v Speaker 5>identity classification is actually a so</v>
<v Speaker 5>socially negotiated process.</v>

333
00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:07.930
<v Speaker 5>And that's the thing about your</v>
<v Speaker 5>identity,</v>

334
00:23:07.931 --> 00:23:11.470
<v Speaker 5>the idea that your identity is this</v>
<v Speaker 5>subjective construct.</v>

335
00:23:11.471 --> 00:23:14.950
<v Speaker 5>It's like I am being literally truthful</v>
<v Speaker 5>about that.</v>

336
00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:19.390
<v Speaker 5>That's what two year olds think and</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's why they can't play with others.</v>

337
00:23:19.391 --> 00:23:24.100
<v Speaker 5>So two year olds are egocentric and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>cannot expand their conception of the</v>

338
00:23:24.101 --> 00:23:28.150
<v Speaker 5>world to include the minds of others.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't really learn to do that until</v>

339
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.860
<v Speaker 5>between two and four.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And by the way,</v>

340
00:23:29.861 --> 00:23:32.530
<v Speaker 5>if they don't learn that by four,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they never learn it.</v>

341
00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:37.840
<v Speaker 5>And so by the time they're for what they</v>
<v Speaker 5>learn is that your identity is actually</v>

342
00:23:37.841 --> 00:23:41.560
<v Speaker 5>a negotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a negotiation from moment to moment</v>

343
00:23:41.561 --> 00:23:43.480
<v Speaker 5>and also throughout the course of your</v>
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

344
00:23:43.481 --> 00:23:46.400
<v Speaker 5>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even a child who was pretending knows</v>

345
00:23:46.401 --> 00:23:50.720
<v Speaker 5>that you be the mom all be the dad will</v>
<v Speaker 5>play house.</v>

346
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:53.360
<v Speaker 5>You can take on that identity at all</v>
<v Speaker 5>take on this one.</v>

347
00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:57.320
<v Speaker 5>But we both have to agree on what the</v>
<v Speaker 5>identity is or we can't play.</v>

348
00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:01.460
<v Speaker 5>So your identity is actually part of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Public Commons and the idea that it's</v>

349
00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:06.520
<v Speaker 5>your subjective determination is it's so</v>
<v Speaker 5>primordially wrong psychologically that</v>

350
00:24:07.671 --> 00:24:10.070
<v Speaker 5>doesn't even register.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

351
00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.610
<v Speaker 5>and the notion that's already written</v>
<v Speaker 5>into the law and that's an absolute</v>

352
00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:16.550
<v Speaker 5>catastrophe because in every possible</v>
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>

353
00:24:16.551 --> 00:24:18.470
<v Speaker 5>developmentally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>psychologically,</v>

354
00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:21.200
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>philosophically,</v>

355
00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:24.800
<v Speaker 5>biologically it's a completely untenable</v>
<v Speaker 5>proposition.</v>

356
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:27.500
<v Speaker 5>But it doesn't matter because it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>already written into the law.</v>

357
00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:31.100
<v Speaker 5>It's like your identity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like your reputation.</v>

358
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:34.010
<v Speaker 5>You think you get to have the reputation</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want.</v>

359
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:35.540
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>good luck with that one.</v>

360
00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:40.490
<v Speaker 5>We're so good at tracking reputation</v>
<v Speaker 5>that if we haven't evolved module for</v>

361
00:24:40.491 --> 00:24:42.920
<v Speaker 5>remembering reputation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you cheat once.</v>

362
00:24:42.921 --> 00:24:45.920
<v Speaker 5>I'll never forget it and you don't get</v>
<v Speaker 5>to object to that,</v>

363
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:47.570
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you can,</v>

364
00:24:47.571 --> 00:24:50.510
<v Speaker 5>but that isn't going to change the</v>
<v Speaker 5>outcome and it doesn't change the fact</v>

365
00:24:50.511 --> 00:24:53.930
<v Speaker 5>that your reputation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is certainly a major part of your</v>

366
00:24:53.931 --> 00:24:56.330
<v Speaker 5>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is something that's dependent on the</v>

367
00:24:56.331 --> 00:24:58.250
<v Speaker 5>interactions that you have with other</v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

368
00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:03.250
<v Speaker 5>Do that to revert to the notion that</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a purely subjective construct is</v>

369
00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.650
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just can't even believe that we're</v>

370
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:10.820
<v Speaker 5>seriously considering that at much less</v>
<v Speaker 5>writing it into the law.</v>

371
00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:16.240
<v Speaker 5>And then there's something even more</v>
<v Speaker 5>appalling going on underneath the law</v>

372
00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:21.050
<v Speaker 5>then that which is we have actually</v>
<v Speaker 5>written into the law now a social</v>

373
00:25:21.051 --> 00:25:25.220
<v Speaker 5>constructivist view of identity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so the social constructivists</v>

374
00:25:25.221 --> 00:25:29.930
<v Speaker 5>roughly believe that all elements of</v>
<v Speaker 5>human identity are socially constructed,</v>

375
00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:34.250
<v Speaker 5>which is very peculiar because at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>same time they also insist that all of</v>

376
00:25:34.251 --> 00:25:38.360
<v Speaker 5>your identity is subjective whim.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And those two propositions aren't</v>

377
00:25:38.361 --> 00:25:41.180
<v Speaker 5>logically commensurate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know the people who are</v>

378
00:25:41.181 --> 00:25:43.730
<v Speaker 5>generating this sort of thing and don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>really care about logical</v>

379
00:25:43.731 --> 00:25:46.160
<v Speaker 5>commensurability.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But in any case,</v>

380
00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:51.460
<v Speaker 5>the proposition that your identity is</v>
<v Speaker 5>somehow unmoored from a reality outside</v>

381
00:25:52.491 --> 00:25:54.830
<v Speaker 5>of your subjective saying linguistic</v>
<v Speaker 5>space.</v>

382
00:25:54.831 --> 00:25:55.970
<v Speaker 5>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

383
00:25:55.971 --> 00:25:57.590
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's wrong.</v>

384
00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:59.990
<v Speaker 5>There's no other way of putting it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like,</v>

385
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:01.700
<v Speaker 5>and this is written into the law</v>
<v Speaker 5>already.</v>

386
00:26:01.701 --> 00:26:05.540
<v Speaker 5>So the proposition is that biological</v>
<v Speaker 5>sex,</v>

387
00:26:05.541 --> 00:26:09.590
<v Speaker 5>which many of the holders of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of saying what admiration for this law</v>

388
00:26:09.591 --> 00:26:11.810
<v Speaker 5>don't even believe exists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I,</v>

389
00:26:11.811 --> 00:26:13.670
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know what to say about</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

390
00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:16.670
<v Speaker 5>But the proposition is that biological</v>
<v Speaker 5>sex,</v>

391
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:22.570
<v Speaker 5>gender identity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gender expression and sexual preference</v>

392
00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.700
<v Speaker 5>vary independently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the law.</v>

393
00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:28.550
<v Speaker 5>And it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It isn't even close to right.</v>

394
00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:33.170
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't mean they don't very but very</v>
<v Speaker 5>independently as a whole different</v>

395
00:26:33.171 --> 00:26:34.940
<v Speaker 5>propositions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>playfully,</v>

396
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:38.390
<v Speaker 5>completely different proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So looking at this way,</v>

397
00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:41.750
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so here's biological sex will say</v>

398
00:26:41.751 --> 00:26:44.140
<v Speaker 5>there's some amount of overlap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't care,</v>

399
00:26:44.141 --> 00:26:49.141
<v Speaker 5>like make me overlap this much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not because the only 0.3% of people</v>

400
00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:54.210
<v Speaker 5>are miscategorized by their biological</v>
<v Speaker 5>sex.</v>

401
00:26:54.211 --> 00:26:55.890
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then you think,</v>

402
00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:59.160
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in terms of gender identity,</v>

403
00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:04.250
<v Speaker 5>it's 99.7% of people have the same</v>
<v Speaker 5>gender identity as their biological sex.</v>

404
00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.150
<v Speaker 5>So much for independent variation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's some variation,</v>

405
00:27:09.151 --> 00:27:12.870
<v Speaker 5>but it's not independent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then you add gender expression on top of</v>

406
00:27:12.871 --> 00:27:13.471
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You say,</v>

407
00:27:13.471 --> 00:27:15.870
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the vast majority of people who are have</v>

408
00:27:15.871 --> 00:27:20.871
<v Speaker 5>one biological sex and the same vial on</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same gender express that the same</v>

409
00:27:21.931 --> 00:27:23.910
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And almost all of those,</v>

410
00:27:23.911 --> 00:27:28.911
<v Speaker 5>we could say 97% it's probably more like</v>
<v Speaker 5>98% but maybe it's 95 I don't care.</v>

411
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:35.870
<v Speaker 5>Have the sexual orientation that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>would expect if you knew their</v>

412
00:27:36.361 --> 00:27:39.330
<v Speaker 5>biological sex,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their gender identity and their gender</v>

413
00:27:39.331 --> 00:27:42.630
<v Speaker 5>expression.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the idea that those are very</v>

414
00:27:42.631 --> 00:27:43.980
<v Speaker 5>independently,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

415
00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:44.940
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fine.</v>

416
00:27:44.941 --> 00:27:49.260
<v Speaker 5>But what that means is that you either</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't know what the word independently</v>

417
00:27:49.261 --> 00:27:52.620
<v Speaker 5>means or you don't care or you've</v>
<v Speaker 5>defined it,</v>

418
00:27:52.621 --> 00:27:54.990
<v Speaker 5>you've redefined it completely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

419
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.900
<v Speaker 5>he can't just muck about with the law.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That way,</v>

420
00:27:57.901 --> 00:28:00.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't instantiate a philosophical</v>

421
00:28:00.931 --> 00:28:03.900
<v Speaker 5>viewpoint into the law without noting</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you're doing,</v>

422
00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:07.980
<v Speaker 5>especially if it's palpably false.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this entire,</v>

423
00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.170
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is partly the reason that I</v>

424
00:28:10.171 --> 00:28:12.300
<v Speaker 5>objected to the thing to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like</v>

425
00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:18.860
<v Speaker 5>apart from these logical and tenability,</v>
<v Speaker 5>given the infinite multiple</v>

426
00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:24.390
<v Speaker 5>multiplication of potential identities,</v>
<v Speaker 5>apart from the fact that there's no</v>

427
00:28:24.391 --> 00:28:29.190
<v Speaker 5>consensus whatsoever on what set of</v>
<v Speaker 5>pronouns you should even hypothetically</v>

428
00:28:29.191 --> 00:28:31.880
<v Speaker 5>use apart from the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

429
00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:37.710
<v Speaker 5>your identity is as socially negotiated</v>
<v Speaker 5>phenomena at its core.</v>

430
00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:43.860
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's the ultimate foolishness of the</v>

431
00:28:43.861 --> 00:28:48.861
<v Speaker 5>proposition that there's no relationship</v>
<v Speaker 5>between these four levels of the manner</v>

432
00:28:49.201 --> 00:28:51.570
<v Speaker 5>in which human beings conceptualize</v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves.</v>

433
00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:56.040
<v Speaker 5>And that's all tangled up in this one</v>
<v Speaker 5>piece of legislation,</v>

434
00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:57.300
<v Speaker 5>which is why</v>

435
00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:04.890
<v Speaker 5>the idea that people should have the</v>
<v Speaker 5>right legal right to force other people</v>

436
00:29:06.221 --> 00:29:11.221
<v Speaker 5>to recognize the particular game that</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're playing at that moment is it's</v>

437
00:29:12.191 --> 00:29:15.370
<v Speaker 5>multidimensionally observed and worse</v>
<v Speaker 5>than that,</v>

438
00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:18.130
<v Speaker 5>it's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And now we'll complete with that.</v>

439
00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:23.050
<v Speaker 5>The reason that it's dangerous as far as</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can tell is because it's also the</v>

440
00:29:23.051 --> 00:29:25.750
<v Speaker 5>expression of an underlying all call it</v>
<v Speaker 5>ideology.</v>

441
00:29:25.751 --> 00:29:29.270
<v Speaker 5>You could call it a philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think it actually qualifies.</v>

442
00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.600
<v Speaker 5>Although,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's mostly postmodern and the</v>

443
00:29:31.601 --> 00:29:35.620
<v Speaker 5>postmodernist are very smart people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know the smart ones,</v>

444
00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:38.860
<v Speaker 5>but their uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their,</v>

445
00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:44.820
<v Speaker 5>their notion of what truth and reality</v>
<v Speaker 5>is debatable at best and pathological at</v>

446
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:49.510
<v Speaker 5>worst and that that's a problem because</v>
<v Speaker 5>this kind of legislation,</v>

447
00:29:49.511 --> 00:29:53.560
<v Speaker 5>he emerges immediately out of that</v>
<v Speaker 5>philosophical context and philosophy</v>

448
00:29:53.561 --> 00:29:57.040
<v Speaker 5>matters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the axioms by which you Orient</v>

449
00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.110
<v Speaker 5>Yourself in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those things mattered.</v>

450
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.990
<v Speaker 5>And if you write a whole new set of</v>
<v Speaker 5>axioms into the law,</v>

451
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:06.460
<v Speaker 5>which we've already done by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going to unfold the unfold</v>

452
00:30:06.461 --> 00:30:10.540
<v Speaker 5>according to their inner logic and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't have any choice about that.</v>

453
00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:12.700
<v Speaker 5>They unfold in some sense all by</v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves.</v>

454
00:30:12.701 --> 00:30:17.050
<v Speaker 5>Just like if a virus invades your body,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it unfolds all by itself.</v>

455
00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:19.810
<v Speaker 5>You think little bitty virus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>great big body.</v>

456
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:22.720
<v Speaker 5>Well don't be thinking that the law has</v>
<v Speaker 5>a virus.</v>

457
00:30:22.721 --> 00:30:24.910
<v Speaker 5>Laws are viruses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's something alive.</v>

458
00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:27.880
<v Speaker 5>You add them to an ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what we are.</v>

459
00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:31.540
<v Speaker 5>They're going to do whatever their</v>
<v Speaker 5>internal logic demands and we're going</v>

460
00:30:31.541 --> 00:30:34.990
<v Speaker 5>to see how that turns out over time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I've seen this sort of thing</v>

461
00:30:34.991 --> 00:30:39.991
<v Speaker 5>happened before when when people walk</v>
<v Speaker 5>down this particular philosophical path,</v>

462
00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:44.710
<v Speaker 5>and I suppose this is the point where</v>
<v Speaker 5>people accuse me of scaremongering,</v>

463
00:30:44.711 --> 00:30:49.711
<v Speaker 5>but I have watched that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the axiomatic presuppositions</v>

464
00:30:49.961 --> 00:30:53.740
<v Speaker 5>nested inside this legislation assume</v>
<v Speaker 5>that human beings have no intrinsic</v>

465
00:30:53.741 --> 00:30:56.110
<v Speaker 5>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what that means is that they can be</v>

466
00:30:56.111 --> 00:30:58.960
<v Speaker 5>remolded in any manner whatsoever by the</v>
<v Speaker 5>state.</v>

467
00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:02.200
<v Speaker 5>While we've watched that happen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't recommend it.</v>

468
00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:07.120
<v Speaker 5>And so it's for all those reasons that I</v>
<v Speaker 5>think that the proposition is false,</v>

469
00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:11.860
<v Speaker 5>the law is observed to the point of</v>
<v Speaker 5>incoherent error.</v>

470
00:31:11.861 --> 00:31:14.620
<v Speaker 5>It's actually wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not just bad law,</v>

471
00:31:14.621 --> 00:31:17.800
<v Speaker 5>it's actually wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And to boot,</v>

472
00:31:17.801 --> 00:31:22.570
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's dangerous and it's not least</v>

473
00:31:22.571 --> 00:31:27.250
<v Speaker 5>dangerous because</v>
<v Speaker 5>it actually constitutes forced speech.</v>

474
00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:31.030
<v Speaker 5>And that's a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a very different thing from just</v>

475
00:31:31.031 --> 00:31:34.090
<v Speaker 5>saying that there are things you</v>
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't say because you'll upset the</v>

476
00:31:34.091 --> 00:31:35.290
<v Speaker 5>polity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

477
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:38.670
<v Speaker 5>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's not the same thing at all.</v>

478
00:31:38.671 --> 00:31:42.940
<v Speaker 5>It's saying there are things you have to</v>
<v Speaker 5>say because you have to act and speak in</v>

479
00:31:42.941 --> 00:31:47.290
<v Speaker 5>accordance with this particular</v>
<v Speaker 5>philosophical view of human beings.</v>

480
00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:49.713
<v Speaker 5>Good enough.</v>

481
00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:55.400
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

482
00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:05.400
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three points I wanted to respond to.</v>

483
00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.660
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

484
00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:11.130
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the force question.</v>

485
00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:17.510
<v Speaker 1>Number two is the matter of the infinite</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of pronouns,</v>

486
00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:20.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one per person.</v>

487
00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:26.780
<v Speaker 1>And the third one</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the question of whether identity is,</v>

488
00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:31.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a negotiated matter.</v>

489
00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:33.810
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so on the,</v>

490
00:32:33.811 --> 00:32:38.100
<v Speaker 1>on the force question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we agreed on this.</v>

491
00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:42.110
<v Speaker 1>We are talking about forced speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No question.</v>

492
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:45.680
<v Speaker 1>This is not a question about what you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

493
00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:49.040
<v Speaker 1>really ought to do in polite society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

494
00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:53.150
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about what the law says</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what the love will make you do.</v>

495
00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:56.570
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not immediately,</v>

496
00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:02.560
<v Speaker 1>but eventually the cops will come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So no bones about it.</v>

497
00:33:04.911 --> 00:33:08.240
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about serious stuff here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just preferences,</v>

498
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:12.530
<v Speaker 1>it's what the state requires you to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the stakes are high,</v>

499
00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:13.603
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about it.</v>

500
00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:15.053
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

501
00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.750
<v Speaker 1>on the infinite number of pronouns</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

502
00:33:19.751 --> 00:33:20.720
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>

503
00:33:20.721 --> 00:33:25.690
<v Speaker 1>you can see that that would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>problematic if in fact we took the</v>

504
00:33:25.691 --> 00:33:30.691
<v Speaker 1>proposition to its logical extension</v>
<v Speaker 1>without pulling it back a little bit.</v>

505
00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:36.010
<v Speaker 1>Then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if everybody is allowed to pick their</v>

506
00:33:36.011 --> 00:33:40.540
<v Speaker 1>own pronoun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it obviously becomes unworkable</v>

507
00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:44.710
<v Speaker 1>because you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't make sense of it if you're</v>

508
00:33:44.711 --> 00:33:47.230
<v Speaker 1>the teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can't keep track.</v>

509
00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:48.480
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

510
00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:50.680
<v Speaker 1>can't keep track of people's first</v>
<v Speaker 1>names,</v>

511
00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:54.430
<v Speaker 1>much less their pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

512
00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:57.870
<v Speaker 1>if you get to the stage where there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

513
00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:01.300
<v Speaker 1>13 different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some classifications for the kinds of</v>

514
00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:06.780
<v Speaker 1>gender identity that you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I think the law is going to say,</v>

515
00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:10.690
<v Speaker 1>well actually no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What enabled us to do is in the first</v>

516
00:34:10.691 --> 00:34:15.691
<v Speaker 1>place was reasonable limits on free</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech and now the requirements are</v>

517
00:34:16.421 --> 00:34:20.950
<v Speaker 1>unreasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we're talking about here is really</v>

518
00:34:20.951 --> 00:34:24.010
<v Speaker 1>the ability to insist upon a gender</v>
<v Speaker 1>neutral pronoun.</v>

519
00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:29.080
<v Speaker 1>If we got so far as to say that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick our own pronoun,</v>

520
00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:33.310
<v Speaker 1>then I don't think the arguments that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>made before really apply like he's now</v>

521
00:34:33.311 --> 00:34:36.480
<v Speaker 1>you're into real absurdity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

522
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:39.790
<v Speaker 1>So this is not a limitless thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is not suggested.</v>

523
00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has their limits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Limitless ability to insist upon the</v>

524
00:34:43.721 --> 00:34:48.460
<v Speaker 1>language to be used by other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All we're saying is that there is a</v>

525
00:34:48.461 --> 00:34:53.461
<v Speaker 1>logical and reasonable case to be made</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there needs to be something that is</v>

526
00:34:53.471 --> 00:34:54.640
<v Speaker 1>neutral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe one,</v>

527
00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:57.670
<v Speaker 1>maybe a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to give a number to it,</v>

528
00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:02.500
<v Speaker 1>but granted if we get to a situation</v>
<v Speaker 1>where there is an unlimited number,</v>

529
00:35:02.501 --> 00:35:05.890
<v Speaker 1>then fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems out of hand to me.</v>

530
00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:12.540
<v Speaker 1>Number three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>identity as a socially negotiated</v>

531
00:35:12.541 --> 00:35:12.991
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

532
00:35:12.991 --> 00:35:14.670
<v Speaker 1>there's some truth to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

533
00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:20.700
<v Speaker 1>In the outside world as you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>interacting with people,</v>

534
00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:24.420
<v Speaker 1>forming relationships with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

535
00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:28.740
<v Speaker 1>of whatever kind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe friendship,</v>

536
00:35:28.741 --> 00:35:30.810
<v Speaker 1>maybe intimate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're starting a family.</v>

537
00:35:30.811 --> 00:35:33.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your gender identity is important to</v>

538
00:35:33.181 --> 00:35:38.181
<v Speaker 1>those people too and so yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is certainly an of social</v>

539
00:35:38.701 --> 00:35:42.020
<v Speaker 1>negotiation in your gender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What</v>

540
00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:46.920
<v Speaker 1>that negotiation's not taking place with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your teacher.</v>

541
00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:50.670
<v Speaker 1>It's not taking place in the classroom.</v>

542
00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:56.290
<v Speaker 1>The teacher doesn't have to know what</v>
<v Speaker 1>that negotiations about.</v>

543
00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:58.150
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to know its outcome.</v>

544
00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:01.513
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

545
00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:06.580
<v Speaker 1>As far as the teacher is concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all he or she or it needs to know is</v>

546
00:36:07.881 --> 00:36:12.881
<v Speaker 1>what you want to be called in the sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>of one or the other or neither.</v>

547
00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:14.563
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>

548
00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:20.210
<v Speaker 4>Let's try this analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The</v>

549
00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:24.880
<v Speaker 1>the point is that gender should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant in the classroom.</v>

550
00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:29.110
<v Speaker 1>Just like race should be irrelevant in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the classroom.</v>

551
00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:34.140
<v Speaker 1>So if we had a situation in the English</v>
<v Speaker 1>language were different races were being</v>

552
00:36:35.801 --> 00:36:40.801
<v Speaker 1>referred to by different pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might find that a little bit of Horn</v>

553
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:48.160
<v Speaker 1>because it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you distinguish between</v>

554
00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:50.560
<v Speaker 1>someone who was white and someone who</v>
<v Speaker 1>was dark?</v>

555
00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:56.610
<v Speaker 1>Same question with gender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you need to distinguish between</v>

556
00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:58.920
<v Speaker 1>someone who was he and someone who was</v>
<v Speaker 1>chic?</v>

557
00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:01.710
<v Speaker 1>It can if you want to and it's okay with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

558
00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:06.630
<v Speaker 1>but the point is you don't need to in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to carry on the task you're</v>

559
00:37:06.631 --> 00:37:10.320
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be performing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if that person doesn't want to fit</v>

560
00:37:10.321 --> 00:37:13.290
<v Speaker 1>into that binary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then what's the big deal?</v>

561
00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:21.270
<v Speaker 4>I think I'll leave it there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

562
00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:35.790
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

563
00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:40.430
<v Speaker 5>it's hard to argue with the</v>
<v Speaker 5>reasonableness of the vast majority of</v>

564
00:37:40.431 --> 00:37:45.431
<v Speaker 5>that statement set of statements,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's the,</v>

565
00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:51.220
<v Speaker 5>the acceptability of the argument is</v>
<v Speaker 5>predicated on whether or not that degree</v>

566
00:37:51.261 --> 00:37:55.880
<v Speaker 5>of reasonableness is actually already</v>
<v Speaker 5>built into the law or will be.</v>

567
00:37:55.881 --> 00:38:00.260
<v Speaker 5>And my suspicions are actually that at</v>
<v Speaker 5>some point it will be,</v>

568
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:04.940
<v Speaker 5>but I can tell you that there's going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be a lot of carnage before them because</v>

569
00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:09.530
<v Speaker 5>my worthy opponent basically pointed out</v>
<v Speaker 5>as I did previously,</v>

570
00:38:09.531 --> 00:38:14.531
<v Speaker 5>that the idea that we can evolve into a</v>
<v Speaker 5>near infinite set of pronouns by the</v>

571
00:38:15.531 --> 00:38:18.200
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which the Ontario Human Rights</v>

572
00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.600
<v Speaker 5>Commission policies already essentially</v>
<v Speaker 5>recognize.</v>

573
00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:24.180
<v Speaker 5>So they've already admitted that</v>
<v Speaker 5>although I'm certain server Julie</v>

574
00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:28.220
<v Speaker 5>certain that the people who formulated</v>
<v Speaker 5>the policies really have no idea when</v>

575
00:38:28.221 --> 00:38:30.800
<v Speaker 5>they formulated that this was going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>go beyond he,</v>

576
00:38:30.801 --> 00:38:34.280
<v Speaker 5>she and they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had no idea that like within five</v>

577
00:38:34.281 --> 00:38:38.920
<v Speaker 5>years that'd be 71 different gender</v>
<v Speaker 5>identities and a set of pronouns</v>

578
00:38:38.921 --> 00:38:40.000
<v Speaker 5>associated with each.</v>

579
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.290
<v Speaker 5>So I think this multiple kid</v>
<v Speaker 5>multiplicative explosion that's</v>

580
00:38:44.291 --> 00:38:45.970
<v Speaker 5>occurred,</v>
<v Speaker 5>caught them by surprise.</v>

581
00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:49.210
<v Speaker 5>They wouldn't have formulated the</v>
<v Speaker 5>legislation that way to begin with.</v>

582
00:38:49.211 --> 00:38:51.550
<v Speaker 5>I think if they would've had the</v>
<v Speaker 5>foresight to see what happened,</v>

583
00:38:51.551 --> 00:38:53.920
<v Speaker 5>but you never know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but all right,</v>

584
00:38:53.921 --> 00:38:56.020
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but back to the idea of these reasonable</v>

585
00:38:56.021 --> 00:38:57.310
<v Speaker 5>limits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

586
00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:01.330
<v Speaker 5>I think that as these matters are forced</v>
<v Speaker 5>through the courts,</v>

587
00:39:01.331 --> 00:39:05.650
<v Speaker 5>up to the Canadian Supreme Court,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that these sorts of limits will in fact</v>

588
00:39:05.651 --> 00:39:07.540
<v Speaker 5>be imposed that we'll find that it</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't,</v>

589
00:39:07.541 --> 00:39:11.440
<v Speaker 5>people don't have the legal right to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>addressed by whatever pronouns they</v>

590
00:39:11.441 --> 00:39:15.760
<v Speaker 5>choose because we run into precisely the</v>
<v Speaker 5>problems that we've been discussing.</v>

591
00:39:15.761 --> 00:39:19.690
<v Speaker 5>But the problem is is that as the</v>
<v Speaker 5>legislation is currently constituted,</v>

592
00:39:19.691 --> 00:39:21.430
<v Speaker 5>which is more or less what we're</v>
<v Speaker 5>discussing,</v>

593
00:39:21.431 --> 00:39:26.431
<v Speaker 5>we'll perhaps it should be constituted</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a manner that would sustain a supreme</v>

594
00:39:26.981 --> 00:39:29.020
<v Speaker 5>court challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If we're going to talk about should,</v>

595
00:39:29.021 --> 00:39:30.940
<v Speaker 5>and I don't think there's a hope in hell</v>
<v Speaker 5>of it,</v>

596
00:39:30.941 --> 00:39:34.870
<v Speaker 5>the way it's constituted right now would</v>
<v Speaker 5>withstand a supreme court challenge.</v>

597
00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:38.800
<v Speaker 5>It'll depend on how they select the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Supreme Court justices and we'll see how</v>

598
00:39:38.801 --> 00:39:40.960
<v Speaker 5>that turns out in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because already,</v>

599
00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:44.470
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the law has been put in place so</v>

600
00:39:44.471 --> 00:39:48.280
<v Speaker 5>that the people who select our judges</v>
<v Speaker 5>are going to have to undergo mandatory</v>

601
00:39:48.281 --> 00:39:51.430
<v Speaker 5>unconscious bias retraining before</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're allowed to sit on the</v>

602
00:39:51.431 --> 00:39:54.130
<v Speaker 5>committees.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so while you can think about that,</v>

603
00:39:54.131 --> 00:39:57.070
<v Speaker 5>and if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I recommend looking into the validity of</v>

604
00:39:57.071 --> 00:39:59.800
<v Speaker 5>the tests that are used to diagnose,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so to speak,</v>

605
00:39:59.801 --> 00:40:02.020
<v Speaker 5>unconscious bias,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they don't even,</v>

606
00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:05.680
<v Speaker 5>they don't even come close to meeting</v>
<v Speaker 5>the necessary requirements for a</v>

607
00:40:05.681 --> 00:40:09.100
<v Speaker 5>clinical diagnostic instrument.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's absolutely no evidence</v>

608
00:40:09.101 --> 00:40:13.600
<v Speaker 5>whatsoever that unconscious bias</v>
<v Speaker 5>retraining produces the intended results</v>

609
00:40:13.601 --> 00:40:16.090
<v Speaker 5>and a fair bit that it actually produces</v>
<v Speaker 5>the opposite.</v>

610
00:40:16.091 --> 00:40:19.780
<v Speaker 5>So we could easily be in a position</v>
<v Speaker 5>where the supreme court itself becomes</v>

611
00:40:19.781 --> 00:40:23.470
<v Speaker 5>pathologized by this process to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>point where they won't invalidate the</v>

612
00:40:23.471 --> 00:40:23.740
<v Speaker 5>law.</v>

613
00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:27.580
<v Speaker 5>But under the current circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say it is inevitable that they</v>

614
00:40:27.581 --> 00:40:29.650
<v Speaker 5>would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but people are going to pay a fish's</v>

615
00:40:29.651 --> 00:40:31.450
<v Speaker 5>price for that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's no,</v>

616
00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:35.800
<v Speaker 5>it's no simple matter to fight a vicious</v>
<v Speaker 5>piece of vicious ill written</v>

617
00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:40.600
<v Speaker 5>pathological piece of legislation all</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way up through the court system to</v>

618
00:40:40.601 --> 00:40:44.920
<v Speaker 5>the Supreme Court and the number of</v>
<v Speaker 5>people who have the emotional</v>

619
00:40:44.921 --> 00:40:48.700
<v Speaker 5>wherewithal to manage that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The strategic resources,</v>

620
00:40:48.701 --> 00:40:52.560
<v Speaker 5>the intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the team and the finances are there.</v>

621
00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:55.390
<v Speaker 5>They're just nonexistent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There might be like two people like that</v>

622
00:40:55.391 --> 00:40:56.770
<v Speaker 5>in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

623
00:40:56.771 --> 00:40:59.230
<v Speaker 5>I mean as her Levant did something like</v>
<v Speaker 5>that with the Alberta,</v>

624
00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:02.030
<v Speaker 5>the Alberta human rights tribunals into,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

625
00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:05.200
<v Speaker 5>just about did him in financially he's a</v>
<v Speaker 5>tough guy.</v>

626
00:41:05.201 --> 00:41:07.360
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty emotionally stable but it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>no joke.</v>

627
00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:11.160
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my proposition is that the law is kermit</v>

628
00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:13.480
<v Speaker 5>currently formulated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is observed,</v>

629
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:16.390
<v Speaker 5>it's a dirt multidimensionally it's bad</v>
<v Speaker 5>law.</v>

630
00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:21.730
<v Speaker 5>And my opponents stated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well essentially it will have to be made</v>

631
00:41:21.731 --> 00:41:23.080
<v Speaker 5>reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like yeah,</v>

632
00:41:23.081 --> 00:41:24.130
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no problem.</v>

633
00:41:24.131 --> 00:41:26.350
<v Speaker 5>If it's made reasonable then it's made</v>
<v Speaker 5>reasonable.</v>

634
00:41:26.351 --> 00:41:29.030
<v Speaker 5>But that isn't what we have now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You might think of I,</v>

635
00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:32.650
<v Speaker 5>I idea of ms cause that's actually not a</v>
<v Speaker 5>bad comparison,</v>

636
00:41:32.651 --> 00:41:34.610
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I'd like to point out that there</v>

637
00:41:34.611 --> 00:41:37.910
<v Speaker 5>were never any legal penalties for not</v>
<v Speaker 5>using miss ever.</v>

638
00:41:37.911 --> 00:41:40.250
<v Speaker 5>And language just doesn't change that</v>
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>

639
00:41:40.251 --> 00:41:43.400
<v Speaker 5>It never changes by legislative fee up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That isn't how it works.</v>

640
00:41:43.401 --> 00:41:45.140
<v Speaker 5>It changes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially in English,</v>

641
00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:48.410
<v Speaker 5>it's bottom up process because the word</v>
<v Speaker 5>is a tool actually.</v>

642
00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:53.390
<v Speaker 5>It's not a description for a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what happens is that if you invent a</v>

643
00:41:53.391 --> 00:41:55.220
<v Speaker 5>good tool,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any of you can do that.</v>

644
00:41:55.221 --> 00:41:59.120
<v Speaker 5>If you invent a word that fix and and on</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the linguistic monkeys,</v>

645
00:41:59.121 --> 00:42:03.170
<v Speaker 5>I was there waiting for that tool,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll pick it up just like that.</v>

646
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:06.530
<v Speaker 5>And the truth of the matter is is that</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one's come up with that particular</v>

647
00:42:06.531 --> 00:42:09.530
<v Speaker 5>linguistic pro tool to solve this</v>
<v Speaker 5>particular problem.</v>

648
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:12.650
<v Speaker 5>And that's an indication that there</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually isn't a solution to it yet.</v>

649
00:42:12.651 --> 00:42:15.530
<v Speaker 5>And that's partly because it's an</v>
<v Speaker 5>exceptionally complicated problem.</v>

650
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:20.180
<v Speaker 5>And so the idea that that should be</v>
<v Speaker 5>solved in some sense by ill conceived,</v>

651
00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:23.900
<v Speaker 5>ill written,</v>
<v Speaker 5>philosophically untenable legislation</v>

652
00:42:23.901 --> 00:42:26.750
<v Speaker 5>that has a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say pathological impunitive</v>

653
00:42:26.751 --> 00:42:30.590
<v Speaker 5>philosophy at its face is it's not a</v>
<v Speaker 5>tenable proposition.</v>

654
00:42:30.591 --> 00:42:33.050
<v Speaker 5>And it's certainly not the law as it</v>
<v Speaker 5>currently stands.</v>

655
00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:38.030
<v Speaker 5>So I guess that stopped for my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my rebuttal.</v>

656
00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:39.163
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

657
00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:45.693
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

658
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:48.050
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll start taking questions.</v>

659
00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:51.930
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

660
00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:59.370
<v Speaker 3>I have a question for a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keiter said that I think doctor,</v>

661
00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:04.060
<v Speaker 3>any sort of already great and I was just</v>
<v Speaker 3>wondering it to speak to it a bit more</v>

662
00:43:04.061 --> 00:43:08.770
<v Speaker 3>directly when we're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether you can or someone to refer you</v>

663
00:43:08.771 --> 00:43:11.380
<v Speaker 3>or refrain from referring to you in</v>
<v Speaker 3>different ways.</v>

664
00:43:11.381 --> 00:43:14.070
<v Speaker 3>I guess one issue that I'm having</v>
<v Speaker 3>difficulty,</v>

665
00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:19.180
<v Speaker 3>one of up thrown down is I think we all</v>
<v Speaker 3>acknowledge that you have a right to</v>

666
00:43:19.181 --> 00:43:21.400
<v Speaker 3>force people to refer to you in certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>

667
00:43:21.401 --> 00:43:26.401
<v Speaker 3>If a professor was at a class and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>had a student who insisted on calling</v>

668
00:43:26.921 --> 00:43:29.260
<v Speaker 3>them a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they were male or you know,</v>

669
00:43:29.261 --> 00:43:32.500
<v Speaker 3>calling them clear or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or I can think of way worse words,</v>

670
00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:33.790
<v Speaker 3>it would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's,</v>

671
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.540
<v Speaker 3>that's not a pronoun and that's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>derogatory label.</v>

672
00:43:37.541 --> 00:43:40.480
<v Speaker 3>That's just meant to degrade me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

673
00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:44.650
<v Speaker 3>but if you know who's to say what is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>pronoun and I'm not sure that it</v>

674
00:43:44.651 --> 00:43:46.330
<v Speaker 3>necessarily would change.</v>

675
00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:50.740
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if 95 or 97 friends all insisted on sort</v>

676
00:43:50.741 --> 00:43:51.800
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

677
00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:54.820
<v Speaker 3>degrading or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>using that pejorative label,</v>

678
00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:56.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the person.</v>

679
00:43:56.111 --> 00:44:00.250
<v Speaker 3>And I think that people who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>transgendered or whatever do experience</v>

680
00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:02.860
<v Speaker 3>when people use the wrong gender labels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do they,</v>

681
00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:05.380
<v Speaker 3>they've experienced real predators.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They experienced that as kind of</v>

682
00:44:05.381 --> 00:44:09.370
<v Speaker 3>oppressive in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know if identity is a subject</v>

683
00:44:09.371 --> 00:44:10.650
<v Speaker 3>or an object,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

684
00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:13.060
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do know that we placed important</v>

685
00:44:13.061 --> 00:44:15.190
<v Speaker 3>demands on one another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

686
00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know that fundamentally like our</v>

687
00:44:17.801 --> 00:44:20.950
<v Speaker 3>society is going to work better if we</v>
<v Speaker 3>respect each other.</v>

688
00:44:20.951 --> 00:44:24.610
<v Speaker 3>And I think history bears bears that out</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>

689
00:44:24.611 --> 00:44:29.220
<v Speaker 3>that self respect and allowing people</v>
<v Speaker 3>self identification to play a role in</v>

690
00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:31.120
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that public aspect.</v>

691
00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:32.603
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

692
00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:36.210
<v Speaker 5>we do already have limits on how people</v>
<v Speaker 5>can refer to each other and they're</v>

693
00:44:36.211 --> 00:44:39.300
<v Speaker 5>informed by how people want themselves</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be referred to.</v>

694
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:41.251
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

695
00:44:41.251 --> 00:44:45.540
<v Speaker 5>Well that's a of questions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm not trying to be a smart Alec</v>

696
00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.580
<v Speaker 5>both.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just not going to have to sort that</v>

697
00:44:47.581 --> 00:44:48.970
<v Speaker 5>out for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He could up.</v>

698
00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:50.610
<v Speaker 5>The first thing I would say is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

699
00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:53.010
<v Speaker 5>pro pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not a linguist to,</v>

700
00:44:53.011 --> 00:44:55.350
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to be able to whip this</v>
<v Speaker 5>off the top of my head,</v>

701
00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:57.240
<v Speaker 5>although I do know that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

702
00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:00.720
<v Speaker 5>there is a psychologist named James</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pennebaker who's written a whole book on</v>

703
00:45:00.721 --> 00:45:02.640
<v Speaker 5>pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which she might be interested in</v>

704
00:45:02.641 --> 00:45:04.560
<v Speaker 5>referring to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And pronouns turned out to be</v>

705
00:45:04.561 --> 00:45:08.130
<v Speaker 5>extraordinarily important as signifiers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're also part of what's called a</v>

706
00:45:08.131 --> 00:45:11.010
<v Speaker 5>closed linguistic category and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't change.</v>

707
00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.140
<v Speaker 5>And so that's something that's useful to</v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

708
00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:17.850
<v Speaker 5>but you also bring up the distinction or</v>
<v Speaker 5>the lack of distinction or made a lack</v>

709
00:45:17.851 --> 00:45:20.490
<v Speaker 5>of distinction between adjectives and</v>
<v Speaker 5>pronouns.</v>

710
00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:24.720
<v Speaker 5>And that's pretty interesting because</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no real reason why if you can't</v>

711
00:45:24.721 --> 00:45:27.410
<v Speaker 5>insist upon which Pronoun I used to</v>
<v Speaker 5>address you,</v>

712
00:45:27.411 --> 00:45:30.960
<v Speaker 5>you can also assist on which adjective I</v>
<v Speaker 5>use to address you.</v>

713
00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:35.150
<v Speaker 5>And there's a lot more adjectives and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so that's cause I don't see like,</v>

714
00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:38.670
<v Speaker 5>if you can choose your Damn Pronoun,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why can't you choose your adjective?</v>

715
00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:40.950
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean adjectives are you the list of</v>

716
00:45:40.951 --> 00:45:43.670
<v Speaker 5>words you listed as pejorative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're actually not pronouns.</v>

717
00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:45.690
<v Speaker 5>They were adjectives.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so you can,</v>

718
00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:49.860
<v Speaker 5>you can object to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's no shortage of times when</v>

719
00:45:49.861 --> 00:45:52.170
<v Speaker 5>you use a pejorative adjective to</v>
<v Speaker 5>describe someone,</v>

720
00:45:52.171 --> 00:45:54.360
<v Speaker 5>especially if you believe that they've</v>
<v Speaker 5>misbehaved.</v>

721
00:45:54.361 --> 00:45:57.270
<v Speaker 5>It's like if the person can insist upon</v>
<v Speaker 5>their pronoun,</v>

722
00:45:57.271 --> 00:45:59.130
<v Speaker 5>why can't they insist upon your</v>
<v Speaker 5>adjective?</v>

723
00:45:59.131 --> 00:46:03.090
<v Speaker 5>And that's another part of this problem</v>
<v Speaker 5>with this multiplicative complexity that</v>

724
00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.520
<v Speaker 5>it isn't addressed properly within the</v>
<v Speaker 5>law.</v>

725
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:07.800
<v Speaker 5>With regards to respect,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

726
00:46:07.801 --> 00:46:08.634
<v Speaker 5>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

727
00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:12.780
<v Speaker 5>human civilization progress is a lot</v>
<v Speaker 5>better if we respect one another.</v>

728
00:46:12.781 --> 00:46:14.700
<v Speaker 5>And I actually don't believe that at</v>
<v Speaker 5>all.</v>

729
00:46:14.701 --> 00:46:18.810
<v Speaker 5>I believe that human civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pr progress's and maintains itself.</v>

730
00:46:18.811 --> 00:46:21.110
<v Speaker 5>When we respect people who've earned</v>
<v Speaker 5>respect,</v>

731
00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:23.430
<v Speaker 5>you don't just respect everybody</v>
<v Speaker 5>randomly.</v>

732
00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:25.290
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the hell uses respect?</v>

733
00:46:25.291 --> 00:46:29.370
<v Speaker 5>If you just respect people randomly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like inflating the currency.</v>

734
00:46:29.371 --> 00:46:32.220
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like the simpsons episode where you</v>

735
00:46:32.221 --> 00:46:34.230
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bart gets a trophy because it's every</v>

736
00:46:34.231 --> 00:46:37.860
<v Speaker 5>child gets a trophy day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All you do is inflate the currency.</v>

737
00:46:37.861 --> 00:46:42.270
<v Speaker 5>Respect is actually limited to that</v>
<v Speaker 5>category of people who've earned respect</v>

738
00:46:42.271 --> 00:46:44.610
<v Speaker 5>in some manners.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So whatever you're talking about with</v>

739
00:46:44.611 --> 00:46:47.490
<v Speaker 5>regards to say common decency between</v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

740
00:46:47.491 --> 00:46:50.610
<v Speaker 5>it's not respect and did definitions</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually matter.</v>

741
00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:54.450
<v Speaker 5>They matter a law.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I hear the respect argument all</v>

742
00:46:54.451 --> 00:46:57.150
<v Speaker 5>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you also can't force me to respect</v>

743
00:46:57.350 --> 00:46:57.920
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

744
00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:00.750
<v Speaker 5>I mean you might be able to force me to</v>
<v Speaker 5>act like I respect you,</v>

745
00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:04.260
<v Speaker 5>but you can't force me to respect you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just not possible.</v>

746
00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:07.770
<v Speaker 5>And you could break me I suppose in and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then perhaps I would do it,</v>

747
00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:10.650
<v Speaker 5>although I can't see exactly how we</v>
<v Speaker 5>precisely.</v>

748
00:47:10.651 --> 00:47:12.720
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

749
00:47:13.650 --> 00:47:15.230
<v Speaker 5>so there's a number of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I,</v>

750
00:47:15.231 --> 00:47:18.240
<v Speaker 5>I get your point and I'm not trying to</v>
<v Speaker 5>denigrate it in any sense.</v>

751
00:47:18.241 --> 00:47:21.930
<v Speaker 5>There's a complex issue here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is to what degree do you allow</v>

752
00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:25.860
<v Speaker 5>individuals to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to govern the conversation that's had</v>

753
00:47:25.861 --> 00:47:27.900
<v Speaker 5>about them in their presence or</v>
<v Speaker 5>otherwise.</v>

754
00:47:27.901 --> 00:47:30.520
<v Speaker 5>But I would just back to my original</v>
<v Speaker 5>argument,</v>

755
00:47:30.521 --> 00:47:33.580
<v Speaker 5>which is that's a negotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's either in negotiation,</v>

756
00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:36.310
<v Speaker 5>you got three states can negotiate with</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone,</v>

757
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:41.410
<v Speaker 5>you can be their slave or you can be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're tired and I would pick</v>

758
00:47:41.411 --> 00:47:43.240
<v Speaker 5>negotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But as far as I'm concerned,</v>

759
00:47:43.241 --> 00:47:45.520
<v Speaker 5>the law right now as it's currently</v>
<v Speaker 5>instantiated,</v>

760
00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:49.300
<v Speaker 5>is a tyrant and it makes people into its</v>
<v Speaker 5>slave and we're going to pay for that.</v>

761
00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:53.200
<v Speaker 5>And it's paid predicated on</v>
<v Speaker 5>hypothetically on respect and</v>

762
00:47:53.201 --> 00:47:55.120
<v Speaker 5>compassionate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't buy that for a second.</v>

763
00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:58.750
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's true in the least.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's a huge literature on</v>

764
00:47:58.751 --> 00:48:01.450
<v Speaker 5>compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's a problem with compassion.</v>

765
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:06.990
<v Speaker 5>Mother grizzly bears are very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very compassionate towards their cubs.</v>

766
00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:11.020
<v Speaker 5>But if you get near those cubs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll tear you to pieces.</v>

767
00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:14.410
<v Speaker 5>And that's the flip side of compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm speaking not as a lawyer here,</v>

768
00:48:14.411 --> 00:48:17.050
<v Speaker 5>but as a psychologist that's already</v>
<v Speaker 5>well documented.</v>

769
00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:22.470
<v Speaker 5>Compassion is by no means an emotion</v>
<v Speaker 5>that produces the desired social</v>

770
00:48:22.991 --> 00:48:24.580
<v Speaker 5>outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Quite the contrary.</v>

771
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:28.720
<v Speaker 5>Quite the contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Life is very much more complicated than</v>

772
00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:29.591
<v Speaker 5>then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

773
00:48:29.591 --> 00:48:31.990
<v Speaker 5>if you were just empathic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything would work out.</v>

774
00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:36.100
<v Speaker 5>It's like you can't meet William Pathic</v>
<v Speaker 5>to everyone and that's a big problem.</v>

775
00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:40.450
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I've answered some of your questions,</v>

776
00:48:40.451 --> 00:48:41.111
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll address it,</v>

777
00:48:41.111 --> 00:48:43.630
<v Speaker 5>some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's about the best I can do it at</v>

778
00:48:43.631 --> 00:48:44.464
<v Speaker 5>the moment.</v>

779
00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:52.850
<v Speaker 5>Your take on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seems like every time on every step</v>

780
00:48:52.851 --> 00:48:56.020
<v Speaker 5>of the quality rates,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this slippery slope argument comes up</v>

781
00:48:56.860 --> 00:49:01.860
<v Speaker 5>and the courts and society solve that</v>
<v Speaker 5>issue that you think that those are air</v>

782
00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:08.710
<v Speaker 5>path.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a tough one because you know,</v>

783
00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:11.260
<v Speaker 5>I think it was yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'll be there if he said something</v>

784
00:49:11.261 --> 00:49:14.440
<v Speaker 5>about things are hard to predict,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially the future.</v>

785
00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:18.520
<v Speaker 5>Just kind of Nice line actually.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's the problem with slippery</v>

786
00:49:18.521 --> 00:49:19.690
<v Speaker 5>slope arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

787
00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:23.380
<v Speaker 5>But I don't think I'm making a slippery</v>
<v Speaker 5>slope argument because I think I'm</v>

788
00:49:23.381 --> 00:49:25.840
<v Speaker 5>objecting to the law as it's currently</v>
<v Speaker 5>instantiated,</v>

789
00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:28.120
<v Speaker 5>not as how it will be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all,</v>

790
00:49:28.121 --> 00:49:32.860
<v Speaker 5>we have already written his social</v>
<v Speaker 5>constructionist philosophy into the law</v>

791
00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:36.400
<v Speaker 5>that's already there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now what the consequences of that will</v>

792
00:49:36.401 --> 00:49:37.270
<v Speaker 5>be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't tell,</v>

793
00:49:37.271 --> 00:49:40.930
<v Speaker 5>but one of the problems is it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's factually wrong.</v>

794
00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:42.250
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's statistic.</v>

795
00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:44.470
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Actually it's statistically wrong.</v>

796
00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:48.460
<v Speaker 5>That's the problem because the</v>
<v Speaker 5>insistence is that those factors that I</v>

797
00:49:48.461 --> 00:49:50.580
<v Speaker 5>described independently very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is a,</v>

798
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:53.620
<v Speaker 5>it's a predicative social</v>
<v Speaker 5>constructionist and postmodern is</v>

799
00:49:53.621 --> 00:49:55.090
<v Speaker 5>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's incorrect.</v>

800
00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:59.410
<v Speaker 5>There's no evidence whatsoever for it</v>
<v Speaker 5>unless you gerrymander the notion of</v>

801
00:49:59.411 --> 00:50:01.270
<v Speaker 5>independence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

802
00:50:01.271 --> 00:50:03.190
<v Speaker 5>once you start doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a big problem.</v>

803
00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:05.920
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I s you know,</v>

804
00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:09.460
<v Speaker 5>so I stand by my initial documentation</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the errors in the law.</v>

805
00:50:09.461 --> 00:50:14.461
<v Speaker 5>And I do think by the way that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>assuming the things continue on their</v>

806
00:50:15.731 --> 00:50:19.720
<v Speaker 5>current jurisprudential course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is debatable,</v>

807
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:22.300
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Ontario Human Rights Commission and</v>

808
00:50:22.301 --> 00:50:25.430
<v Speaker 5>it's in the powers that it's abrogated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's being given by the,</v>

809
00:50:25.431 --> 00:50:26.050
<v Speaker 5>by,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

810
00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:28.070
<v Speaker 5>by the legislative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It</v>

811
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:30.100
<v Speaker 1>has the right to suspend normal tier of</v>
<v Speaker 1>jurors,</v>

812
00:50:30.101 --> 00:50:34.650
<v Speaker 1>prudential procedure and also precedent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might want to look that up cause</v>

813
00:50:34.651 --> 00:50:39.651
<v Speaker 1>that's a real fun thing to read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if society continues on its current</v>

814
00:50:40.131 --> 00:50:43.440
<v Speaker 1>course and the courts operate under</v>
<v Speaker 1>their current presuppositions,</v>

815
00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:48.230
<v Speaker 1>then this law will be subject to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>limits that you described and so could</v>

816
00:50:48.231 --> 00:50:49.220
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like I said,</v>

817
00:50:49.221 --> 00:50:50.690
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be carnage along the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way</v>

818
00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:55.130
<v Speaker 6>are there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I just want to bring you a little bit</v>

819
00:50:55.131 --> 00:50:59.120
<v Speaker 6>of facts into this cause I know you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>talking to those get carried away,</v>

820
00:50:59.170 --> 00:51:03.830
<v Speaker 6>but box unfortunately along both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I don't have it.</v>

821
00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Mr. Peterson suggested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

822
00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:07.150
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

823
00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:09.340
<v Speaker 1>the key distinction here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>

824
00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:11.880
<v Speaker 1>this is me talking now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that the advocate,</v>

825
00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:17.540
<v Speaker 1>the key distinction is that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>legislation doesn't prevent you from</v>

826
00:51:17.851 --> 00:51:21.960
<v Speaker 1>doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It requires you to do something that is</v>

827
00:51:21.961 --> 00:51:26.010
<v Speaker 1>now outrageous proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Outrageous</v>

828
00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:32.890
<v Speaker 1>it speaks is bad enough because it is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>significant step away from California</v>

829
00:51:34.051 --> 00:51:34.681
<v Speaker 1>crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

830
00:51:34.681 --> 00:51:37.920
<v Speaker 1>there are some restrictions on free</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech and Mike and which are</v>

831
00:51:37.921 --> 00:51:42.780
<v Speaker 1>appropriate counseling a crime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just watching defamation might be,</v>

832
00:51:42.781 --> 00:51:46.380
<v Speaker 1>although that has some problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Kelsey and crime is the best</v>

833
00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:49.710
<v Speaker 1>situation where you shouldn't be allowed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say that,</v>

834
00:51:50.570 --> 00:51:53.820
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hate speech is an expression of an</v>

835
00:51:53.821 --> 00:51:57.480
<v Speaker 1>opinion about nobody in particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

836
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:59.690
<v Speaker 1>it's about a group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

837
00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:04.710
<v Speaker 1>if you have an individual who believes</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things about a group,</v>

838
00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:08.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of people including me,</v>

839
00:52:08.271 --> 00:52:12.960
<v Speaker 1>would say that's unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're living in a free society,</v>

840
00:52:14.250 --> 00:52:17.220
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to be allowed to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you think,</v>

841
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.940
<v Speaker 1>even if other people don't like it.</v>

842
00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:26.060
<v Speaker 1>And RFN is the essence of free speech is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to offense,</v>

843
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:32.100
<v Speaker 1>not to Burns back offense or were you</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

844
00:52:32.101 --> 00:52:34.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to answer that more or less as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a psychologist.</v>

845
00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:40.840
<v Speaker 1>So what are the tenants of clinical</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy including psychiatry and it's</v>

846
00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:47.840
<v Speaker 1>say nonmedical forms is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>dialogue is curative.</v>

847
00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:49.750
<v Speaker 1>That's actually the fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition.</v>

848
00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:51.253
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

849
00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:55.450
<v Speaker 1>the thing about having someone in</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy is,</v>

850
00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:58.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're often like everyone bent</v>

851
00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:01.090
<v Speaker 1>over shape quite badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes homicidal,</v>

852
00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:06.300
<v Speaker 1>sometimes homicidal is good enough and</v>
<v Speaker 1>her 10 and vengeful and you know,</v>

853
00:53:09.610 --> 00:53:11.230
<v Speaker 1>and for good reason often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

854
00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:12.130
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no joe,</v>

855
00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:13.990
<v Speaker 1>good reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were in their shoes,</v>

856
00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:16.150
<v Speaker 1>you'd feel the same way in all</v>
<v Speaker 1>probability.</v>

857
00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:22.060
<v Speaker 1>You have to let those people talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to let them talk.</v>

858
00:53:22.061 --> 00:53:25.120
<v Speaker 1>They don't even know what they think</v>
<v Speaker 1>until they talk.</v>

859
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:25.951
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

860
00:53:25.951 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

861
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:27.390
<v Speaker 5>think and then you talk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

862
00:53:27.391 --> 00:53:28.224
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't.</v>

863
00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:30.210
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most people can't think at all.</v>

864
00:53:30.211 --> 00:53:32.040
<v Speaker 5>And I don't mean that in a pejorative</v>
<v Speaker 5>sense.</v>

865
00:53:32.041 --> 00:53:34.060
<v Speaker 5>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very difficult to learn to think because</v>

866
00:53:34.061 --> 00:53:38.400
<v Speaker 5>to think you have to hold an argument</v>
<v Speaker 5>between two opposing positions in your</v>

867
00:53:38.401 --> 00:53:41.820
<v Speaker 5>own head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you have to delineate both positions?</v>

868
00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:43.620
<v Speaker 5>And you have to make like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

869
00:53:43.621 --> 00:53:47.070
<v Speaker 5>not a straw man out of either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want to make and Sam Harris</v>

870
00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:51.060
<v Speaker 5>Tournament an iron man or both and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to do that alone.</v>

871
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:52.051
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

872
00:53:52.051 --> 00:53:53.940
<v Speaker 5>maybe you can do that if you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dostoyevsky,</v>

873
00:53:53.941 --> 00:53:57.420
<v Speaker 5>but because he's the only person I've</v>
<v Speaker 5>seen who's really managed that</v>

874
00:53:57.421 --> 00:54:00.810
<v Speaker 5>consistently,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but to expect anything other than an</v>

875
00:54:00.811 --> 00:54:05.811
<v Speaker 5>unbelievably well trained mind to even</v>
<v Speaker 5>even step into that territory is naive</v>

876
00:54:06.571 --> 00:54:09.390
<v Speaker 5>beyond belief.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Almost everyone thinks by talking,</v>

877
00:54:09.570 --> 00:54:12.420
<v Speaker 5>they don't even know what they think</v>
<v Speaker 5>until they speak.</v>

878
00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:16.020
<v Speaker 5>And so often if you let people speak,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll think they'll speak and they'll</v>

879
00:54:16.021 --> 00:54:17.130
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

880
00:54:17.131 --> 00:54:19.890
<v Speaker 5>and then they become aware of some</v>
<v Speaker 5>internal contradictions or maybe they</v>

881
00:54:19.891 --> 00:54:21.920
<v Speaker 5>shock themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That happens a lot.</v>

882
00:54:21.921 --> 00:54:22.291
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

883
00:54:22.291 --> 00:54:25.860
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe I said that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they hear what they have to say.</v>

884
00:54:25.861 --> 00:54:28.290
<v Speaker 5>It's being revealed themselves to</v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves.</v>

885
00:54:28.530 --> 00:54:29.610
<v Speaker 5>Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that just enough,</v>

886
00:54:29.611 --> 00:54:31.560
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is often enough to change them.</v>

887
00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:33.740
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but even if it isn't,</v>

888
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:36.390
<v Speaker 5>let's say they're particularly</v>
<v Speaker 5>intransigent and we're not debating</v>

889
00:54:36.391 --> 00:54:38.850
<v Speaker 5>about whether hate speech exists because</v>
<v Speaker 5>bloody well,</v>

890
00:54:38.851 --> 00:54:41.430
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It exists and it can be unbelievably</v>

891
00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:44.820
<v Speaker 5>pathological and I think I'm actually</v>
<v Speaker 5>quite familiar with that sort of thing,</v>

892
00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:50.450
<v Speaker 5>but you want that out in the air so that</v>
<v Speaker 5>people can hear it.</v>

893
00:54:51.421 --> 00:54:53.520
<v Speaker 5>You want to drive the people who hate</v>
<v Speaker 5>underground.</v>

894
00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:56.280
<v Speaker 5>We know what happens psychologically</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you do that,</v>

895
00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:57.960
<v Speaker 5>it's a very bad idea.</v>

896
00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:02.960
<v Speaker 5>Anything you drive underground thrives.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It thrives and it partly thrives because</v>

897
00:55:03.061 --> 00:55:06.450
<v Speaker 5>it isn't even allowed to express itself</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then it festers and turned into,</v>

898
00:55:06.451 --> 00:55:10.740
<v Speaker 5>it turns into hatred that far exceeds</v>
<v Speaker 5>the original and the idea that you make</v>

899
00:55:10.741 --> 00:55:14.370
<v Speaker 5>society safe by not letting horrible</v>
<v Speaker 5>people say terrible things.</v>

900
00:55:14.371 --> 00:55:16.650
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not a good crop position.</v>

901
00:55:16.770 --> 00:55:20.310
<v Speaker 5>You want those people out in the open</v>
<v Speaker 5>where they can say what they have to say</v>

902
00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:22.420
<v Speaker 5>first of all so they can see what</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>

903
00:55:22.421 --> 00:55:25.980
<v Speaker 5>second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that they can see how people respond</v>

904
00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:29.430
<v Speaker 5>because you don't even know what you</v>
<v Speaker 5>should think in some sense until you</v>

905
00:55:29.431 --> 00:55:32.070
<v Speaker 5>watch how people respond.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know at some,</v>

906
00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:34.660
<v Speaker 5>well I won't go on and on about that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

907
00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:36.250
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then the question,</v>

908
00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:38.760
<v Speaker 5>if there's other questions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who defines ate cheese?</v>

909
00:55:38.761 --> 00:55:41.310
<v Speaker 5>That's a deadly one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's great if you're on the</v>

910
00:55:41.311 --> 00:55:45.350
<v Speaker 5>left and the left is in power because</v>
<v Speaker 5>the left defined statement there are</v>

911
00:55:45.351 --> 00:55:46.860
<v Speaker 5>going to be in power forever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

912
00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:50.190
<v Speaker 5>And as soon as the people who were on</v>
<v Speaker 5>the opposite side come into power,</v>

913
00:55:50.191 --> 00:55:54.330
<v Speaker 5>they're gonna use whatever arguments you</v>
<v Speaker 5>had and their own and whatever you think</v>

914
00:55:54.331 --> 00:55:57.000
<v Speaker 5>is going to be hate speech like right</v>
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

915
00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:59.910
<v Speaker 5>So you should always,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is what the founders of the</v>

916
00:55:59.911 --> 00:56:01.470
<v Speaker 5>American constitution get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

917
00:56:01.471 --> 00:56:02.460
<v Speaker 5>they always thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

918
00:56:02.461 --> 00:56:06.660
<v Speaker 5>how could a absolute mlevel malevolent</v>
<v Speaker 5>full screw this up?</v>

919
00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:09.810
<v Speaker 5>They never thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well how can we establish the Utopia?</v>

920
00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:13.380
<v Speaker 5>So that's what you're always thinking</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're putting a limit on something</v>

921
00:56:13.381 --> 00:56:15.120
<v Speaker 5>including someone else's speech.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

922
00:56:15.121 --> 00:56:18.000
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how could the most malevolent fool</v>

923
00:56:18.001 --> 00:56:22.320
<v Speaker 5>imaginable screw this up the worst</v>
<v Speaker 5>possible way and then presume that will</v>

924
00:56:22.321 --> 00:56:26.980
<v Speaker 5>happen and then take steps so that that</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't how it turns out.</v>

925
00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:32.550
<v Speaker 5>So you are let the people who have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who have horrifying viewpoints express</v>

926
00:56:33.291 --> 00:56:33.761
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

927
00:56:33.761 --> 00:56:37.840
<v Speaker 5>subject to these limitations because you</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to make them into martyrs.</v>

928
00:56:37.841 --> 00:56:40.930
<v Speaker 5>That's what happened with Gif.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't say it properly cared wheel</v>

929
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:42.790
<v Speaker 5>dues.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's right.</v>

930
00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:46.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Dutch ship who's leading the polls</v>

931
00:56:46.931 --> 00:56:48.790
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and who has a pretty decent chance of</v>

932
00:56:48.791 --> 00:56:51.220
<v Speaker 5>winning the election.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They nailed him for hate speech and his</v>

933
00:56:51.221 --> 00:56:53.890
<v Speaker 5>popularity went up like 4%.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

934
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:56.980
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't seem like very smart move to</v>
<v Speaker 5>me,</v>

935
00:56:57.070 --> 00:57:00.460
<v Speaker 5>but I'm sure he's not too unhappy about</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

936
00:57:01.250 --> 00:57:03.280
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it might be that the fate of the</v>

937
00:57:03.330 --> 00:57:05.260
<v Speaker 5>rest on his shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe not.</v>

938
00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:06.670
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it's marine Le Pen</v>

939
00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:10.570
<v Speaker 4>in the center.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you both mentioned the difference</v>

940
00:57:10.571 --> 00:57:13.240
<v Speaker 4>between different degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

941
00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:15.790
<v Speaker 4>laws that are telling you not to say</v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

942
00:57:15.850 --> 00:57:20.850
<v Speaker 4>which is a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if you could talk more about</v>

943
00:57:21.101 --> 00:57:26.101
<v Speaker 4>that or why you think one is more</v>
<v Speaker 4>extreme in the other way.</v>

944
00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:29.100
<v Speaker 4>Both seem to be imposing some</v>
<v Speaker 4>dishonesty.</v>

945
00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:37.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that laws that restrict</v>

946
00:57:37.151 --> 00:57:41.740
<v Speaker 1>your speech in the ways that we've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>describing are any good either.</v>

947
00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:43.690
<v Speaker 1>I think they're both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

948
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:45.940
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

949
00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:50.470
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the requiring you to use a word that is</v>

950
00:57:50.471 --> 00:57:52.380
<v Speaker 1>not actually in the dictionary yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

951
00:57:52.381 --> 00:57:53.980
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suggested that language was</v>

952
00:57:53.981 --> 00:57:57.940
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary and it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>language does change and it may well be</v>

953
00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:02.140
<v Speaker 1>that we get this kind of a pronoun</v>
<v Speaker 1>sooner or later.</v>

954
00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:06.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm not objecting to that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that kind of a problem from that</v>

955
00:58:06.511 --> 00:58:08.740
<v Speaker 1>would be kind of cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably very appropriate.</v>

956
00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:12.880
<v Speaker 1>And civilized society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the word I'm talking about when</v>

957
00:58:12.881 --> 00:58:16.000
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm criticizing it.</v>

958
00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:20.350
<v Speaker 1>It's the idea that we should be changing</v>
<v Speaker 1>language by statute.</v>

959
00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:26.530
<v Speaker 1>That is the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means that language is now</v>

960
00:58:26.531 --> 00:58:29.860
<v Speaker 1>considered to be in the purview of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

961
00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:33.850
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

962
00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:36.430
<v Speaker 4>not a free country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

963
00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:37.430
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

964
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:39.020
<v Speaker 5>that's what I'm asking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>answering your question,</v>

965
00:58:39.021 --> 00:58:40.910
<v Speaker 5>but I just think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean they're both bad.</v>

966
00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:43.970
<v Speaker 5>Just one's more extreme than the other</v>
<v Speaker 5>one is.</v>

967
00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:45.593
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let,</v>

968
00:58:45.610 --> 00:58:48.980
<v Speaker 5>let me tell you about an experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>

969
00:58:49.370 --> 00:58:50.660
<v Speaker 5>people think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they think,</v>

970
00:58:50.661 --> 00:58:53.750
<v Speaker 5>which we've already gone through and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they do that only to a limited degree</v>

971
00:58:53.751 --> 00:58:56.330
<v Speaker 5>because thinking is hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And most of you do that by talking.</v>

972
00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:59.600
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but people also think they know what</v>

973
00:58:59.601 --> 00:59:02.510
<v Speaker 5>they're talking about when they say</v>
<v Speaker 5>something in general and if they don't,</v>

974
00:59:02.511 --> 00:59:07.511
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not being cruel about this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like imagine I asked one of you to come</v>

975
00:59:07.791 --> 00:59:10.250
<v Speaker 5>up and draw a helicopter on the board.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

976
00:59:10.310 --> 00:59:11.400
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to draw it like a</v>

977
00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:13.610
<v Speaker 5>helicopter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a five year old draws.</v>

978
00:59:13.611 --> 00:59:17.150
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be like a box with a</v>
<v Speaker 5>beanie on top of it that the stick out</v>

979
00:59:17.151 --> 00:59:18.920
<v Speaker 5>the aspect helicopters like no,</v>

980
00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:21.260
<v Speaker 1>that's going to help you.</v>

981
00:59:22.290 --> 00:59:24.660
<v Speaker 5>Like you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you don't know about helicopters</v>

982
00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:30.020
<v Speaker 5>would still many volumes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're knowledge is sufficient to</v>

983
00:59:30.021 --> 00:59:35.021
<v Speaker 5>communicate kind of an abstracted</v>
<v Speaker 5>representation and a lot of your thought</v>

984
00:59:35.711 --> 00:59:39.170
<v Speaker 5>is actually like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't know as much as you think you</v>

985
00:59:39.171 --> 00:59:40.004
<v Speaker 5>know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

986
00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:43.190
<v Speaker 5>and that means you're more vulnerable in</v>
<v Speaker 5>many ways than you think.</v>

987
00:59:43.191 --> 00:59:45.890
<v Speaker 5>And so here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's say I bring you into the lab and I</v>

988
00:59:45.891 --> 00:59:48.830
<v Speaker 5>get you to fill out a political</v>
<v Speaker 5>attitudes questionnaire and I localize</v>

989
00:59:48.831 --> 00:59:51.500
<v Speaker 5>you say pathway beacon center and</v>
<v Speaker 5>radical,</v>

990
00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:54.620
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe an NDP territory or something like</v>

991
00:59:54.621 --> 00:59:57.860
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I ask you to write a 500 word</v>

992
00:59:57.861 --> 01:00:01.340
<v Speaker 5>essay about why corporations are a</v>
<v Speaker 5>blessing.</v>

993
01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:03.920
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now so you don't agree with it.</v>

994
01:00:03.921 --> 01:00:04.341
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

995
01:00:04.341 --> 01:00:06.830
<v Speaker 5>I know you don't agree with it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like try to write a decent essay.</v>

996
01:00:06.831 --> 01:00:09.440
<v Speaker 5>If you'd run a good one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll give you like an extra 10 bucks or</v>

997
01:00:09.441 --> 01:00:10.310
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

998
01:00:10.311 --> 01:00:11.540
<v Speaker 5>50 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

999
01:00:11.570 --> 01:00:12.140
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

1000
01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:16.610
<v Speaker 5>So you write out this essay and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>contrary view point and I'll bring you</v>

1001
01:00:16.611 --> 01:00:19.640
<v Speaker 5>back the next week and I give you the</v>
<v Speaker 5>same political attitudes questionnaire.</v>

1002
01:00:20.570 --> 01:00:24.140
<v Speaker 5>What do you think happens?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've moved substantially towards the</v>

1003
01:00:24.141 --> 01:00:27.110
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so if I regulate what you have to</v>

1004
01:00:27.111 --> 01:00:29.600
<v Speaker 5>save,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I regulate what you think.</v>

1005
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:32.210
<v Speaker 5>And you might think no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you're wrong.</v>

1006
01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:35.360
<v Speaker 5>Because what you think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you say,</v>

1007
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:38.090
<v Speaker 5>especially if you do it eventually</v>
<v Speaker 5>determines what you think.</v>

1008
01:00:38.810 --> 01:00:42.050
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I am not willing to cede that to the</v>

1009
01:00:42.051 --> 01:00:43.100
<v Speaker 5>state,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but also,</v>

1010
01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:46.820
<v Speaker 5>but not only because I object,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially to this particular</v>

1011
01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:51.110
<v Speaker 5>philosophical in banding of this</v>
<v Speaker 5>particular statute to say,</v>

1012
01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:56.440
<v Speaker 5>but also because you see your stupid</v>
<v Speaker 5>opinion is the corrective for the</v>

1013
01:00:56.511 --> 01:00:58.640
<v Speaker 5>states.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stupid opinions,</v>

1014
01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:02.780
<v Speaker 5>like we've all just swamped in ignorance</v>
<v Speaker 5>and stupidity.</v>

1015
01:01:02.781 --> 01:01:06.020
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a human condition and states are</v>

1016
01:01:06.021 --> 01:01:09.530
<v Speaker 5>horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tyrannosaur tyrannical messes and</v>

1017
01:01:09.531 --> 01:01:12.200
<v Speaker 5>individuals are like corrupt and blind.</v>

1018
01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:14.540
<v Speaker 5>And so it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can stumble around in the world at</v>

1019
01:01:14.541 --> 01:01:17.060
<v Speaker 5>all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what you hope is that now and then</v>

1020
01:01:17.061 --> 01:01:22.061
<v Speaker 5>some Dingbat Otter is something vaguely</v>
<v Speaker 5>sensible that helps curb the tyranny of</v>

1021
01:01:22.161 --> 01:01:24.710
<v Speaker 5>the state.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're going to have to let a lot of</v>

1022
01:01:24.711 --> 01:01:29.090
<v Speaker 5>stupidity be aired before any pearls of</v>
<v Speaker 5>wisdom emerge to the surface.</v>

1023
01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:33.710
<v Speaker 5>So you have to let people stumble around</v>
<v Speaker 5>like prejudice morons because that's</v>

1024
01:01:33.711 --> 01:01:36.440
<v Speaker 5>what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But hopefully as they stumble and</v>

1025
01:01:36.441 --> 01:01:39.680
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can become a little less appalling.</v>

1026
01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:42.350
<v Speaker 5>And so can this state,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's,</v>

1027
01:01:42.351 --> 01:01:43.410
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you told me envision.</v>

1028
01:01:43.550 --> 01:01:45.430
<v Speaker 5>I can tell you that's for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1029
01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:50.360
<v Speaker 5>but I've never seen a utopian state and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm certainly never seen a perfect</v>

1030
01:01:50.361 --> 01:01:52.910
<v Speaker 5>person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it seems pretty perfectly reasonable</v>

1031
01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:55.130
<v Speaker 5>to me to three of them be exactly that</v>
<v Speaker 5>matter.</v>

1032
01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:59.690
<v Speaker 5>Don't let people inside your head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It isn't a lot of obvious that they know</v>

1033
01:01:59.691 --> 01:02:00.524
<v Speaker 5>what they're doing.</v>

1034
01:02:01.070 --> 01:02:02.760
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1035
01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:04.070
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1036
01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:07.040
<v Speaker 5>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a thought while you both were</v>

1037
01:02:07.041 --> 01:02:07.874
<v Speaker 5>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1038
01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:13.930
<v Speaker 5>and it seems like the sort of genesis of</v>
<v Speaker 5>this debate comes from people who they</v>

1039
01:02:14.661 --> 01:02:18.310
<v Speaker 5>feel as though the current words don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>describe them accurately.</v>

1040
01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:21.330
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are men who feel like women and</v>

1041
01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:23.550
<v Speaker 5>vice versa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then there's people who don't feel like</v>

1042
01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:27.570
<v Speaker 5>either applied.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think you're Mr. Peterson.</v>

1043
01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:31.860
<v Speaker 5>I think you're right to point out that</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a kind of weird flip that occurs</v>

1044
01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:34.800
<v Speaker 5>where it's no longer that the language</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't describe them.</v>

1045
01:02:34.801 --> 01:02:39.801
<v Speaker 5>It's that the language has to sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>point out their exact identity and</v>

1046
01:02:39.961 --> 01:02:43.680
<v Speaker 5>uniqueness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think maybe a way to sort of</v>

1047
01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:48.540
<v Speaker 5>reframe the idea is not to have a</v>
<v Speaker 5>language that has to cater to every</v>

1048
01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:52.980
<v Speaker 5>single person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but sort of a singular term that can,</v>

1049
01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:57.720
<v Speaker 5>didn't know whether or not someone wants</v>
<v Speaker 5>to partake in the current structure of</v>

1050
01:02:57.721 --> 01:02:58.350
<v Speaker 5>language.</v>

1051
01:02:58.350 --> 01:03:01.890
<v Speaker 5>So he or she,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then if you had a third term that</v>

1052
01:03:01.891 --> 01:03:06.330
<v Speaker 5>didn't have to have any connotations of</v>
<v Speaker 5>gender but rather stood for the</v>

1053
01:03:06.331 --> 01:03:09.570
<v Speaker 5>proposition that they know they don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>associate with you or sheet.</v>

1054
01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:14.550
<v Speaker 5>And that way you can leave it sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>facially neutral to any particular</v>

1055
01:03:14.551 --> 01:03:15.760
<v Speaker 5>person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1056
01:03:15.761 --> 01:03:18.340
<v Speaker 5>maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe reasonable legislation would mean</v>

1057
01:03:18.430 --> 01:03:19.750
<v Speaker 5>set up in that manner,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1058
01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:22.960
<v Speaker 5>But I would say let's democratize the</v>
<v Speaker 5>problem.</v>

1059
01:03:24.370 --> 01:03:27.520
<v Speaker 5>As soon as someone comes up with a</v>
<v Speaker 5>solution that people find usable,</v>

1060
01:03:27.521 --> 01:03:29.110
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like ms,</v>

1061
01:03:29.111 --> 01:03:30.960
<v Speaker 5>it's like I use ms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1062
01:03:30.970 --> 01:03:34.090
<v Speaker 5>I think it's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's useful.</v>

1063
01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:36.580
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm actually more comfortable using it,</v>

1064
01:03:36.581 --> 01:03:37.390
<v Speaker 5>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>

1065
01:03:37.390 --> 01:03:40.750
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I kinda gone point people didn't want to</v>

1066
01:03:40.751 --> 01:03:44.680
<v Speaker 5>have their marital status advertise</v>
<v Speaker 5>publicly didn't seem necessary.</v>

1067
01:03:44.770 --> 01:03:47.650
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>women aren't the same as they were a</v>

1068
01:03:47.650 --> 01:03:48.090
<v Speaker 5>hundred years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1069
01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:51.880
<v Speaker 5>And they're not even close to the same</v>
<v Speaker 5>pill was a biological revolution.</v>

1070
01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:54.730
<v Speaker 5>Everything's flipped upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we needed a new word.</v>

1071
01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:57.430
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We came up with one wasn't,</v>

1072
01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:02.520
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't implemented by force,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was implemented by public opinion and</v>

1073
01:04:03.311 --> 01:04:05.320
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's how it English in particular,</v>

1074
01:04:05.321 --> 01:04:07.630
<v Speaker 5>like the French French is a bit</v>
<v Speaker 5>different because they actually have</v>

1075
01:04:07.631 --> 01:04:10.300
<v Speaker 5>committees to decide what constitutes an</v>
<v Speaker 5>acceptable word,</v>

1076
01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.700
<v Speaker 5>especially in France,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but also in Quebec.</v>

1077
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.400
<v Speaker 5>But in English it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the Commons man.</v>

1078
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:17.380
<v Speaker 5>Throw a word out there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you,</v>

1079
01:04:17.381 --> 01:04:19.120
<v Speaker 5>if you've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you've nailed the problem,</v>

1080
01:04:19.570 --> 01:04:21.910
<v Speaker 5>people will pick that up so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't even believe it.</v>

1081
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.610
<v Speaker 5>They will just spread virally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1082
01:04:24.611 --> 01:04:26.590
<v Speaker 5>we don't have that solution.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And why is that?</v>

1083
01:04:26.650 --> 01:04:28.030
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because we don't know how to solve this</v>

1084
01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:30.940
<v Speaker 5>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so the law legislators come along</v>

1085
01:04:30.941 --> 01:04:31.421
<v Speaker 5>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well you,</v>

1086
01:04:31.421 --> 01:04:34.540
<v Speaker 5>so by asking each person to tell you</v>
<v Speaker 5>what to say,</v>

1087
01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:35.260
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1088
01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:40.260
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wrong plus dangerous plus motivated and</v>

1089
01:04:40.571 --> 01:04:41.620
<v Speaker 5>a variety of other things.</v>

1090
01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:45.430
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so sure fine could work,</v>

1091
01:04:45.730 --> 01:04:48.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I can't decide if that work because</v>

1092
01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:53.340
<v Speaker 5>there's a strange idea now for some</v>
<v Speaker 5>reason that in some sense the world is</v>

1093
01:04:55.510 --> 01:05:00.470
<v Speaker 5>obligated to validate your identity and</v>
<v Speaker 5>that ain't that.</v>

1094
01:05:00.550 --> 01:05:04.330
<v Speaker 5>So it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so you deal with the world as it is,</v>

1095
01:05:04.450 --> 01:05:09.070
<v Speaker 5>as we all do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if a word comes along with it works,</v>

1096
01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:14.680
<v Speaker 5>it will be used by people because people</v>
<v Speaker 5>are interacting in negotiating.</v>

1097
01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:20.640
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't happen because there is a</v>
<v Speaker 5>legal idea that the world has to respond</v>

1098
01:05:22.001 --> 01:05:24.930
<v Speaker 5>to your needs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just not the case.</v>

1099
01:05:24.970 --> 01:05:28.980
<v Speaker 5>If the world is required to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to validate your identity,</v>

1100
01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:33.220
<v Speaker 5>you are done for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the reason for that is that every</v>

1101
01:05:33.221 --> 01:05:37.510
<v Speaker 5>single one of you have a pathological</v>
<v Speaker 5>direction in which you are likely to go.</v>

1102
01:05:37.570 --> 01:05:41.200
<v Speaker 5>And that's because every temperamental</v>
<v Speaker 5>virtue comes with a temperamental bites.</v>

1103
01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:42.490
<v Speaker 5>And so the only,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1104
01:05:42.491 --> 01:05:44.560
<v Speaker 5>you think you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like you're not,</v>

1105
01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:45.790
<v Speaker 5>you're not even close.</v>

1106
01:05:46.210 --> 01:05:48.400
<v Speaker 5>If I put you alone in a cave for two</v>
<v Speaker 5>weeks,</v>

1107
01:05:48.401 --> 01:05:49.470
<v Speaker 5>you'd be done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1108
01:05:49.471 --> 01:05:53.320
<v Speaker 5>he can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't be saying on your own.</v>

1109
01:05:54.130 --> 01:05:56.140
<v Speaker 5>And so what happens is that your</v>
<v Speaker 5>parents,</v>

1110
01:05:56.141 --> 01:05:59.650
<v Speaker 5>if they have any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>train you roughly speaking to be vaguely</v>

1111
01:05:59.651 --> 01:06:03.370
<v Speaker 5>acceptable to other people and they keep</v>
<v Speaker 5>nudging and winking at you every time</v>

1112
01:06:03.371 --> 01:06:07.060
<v Speaker 5>you're a moron so that you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get nudged into something</v>

1113
01:06:07.061 --> 01:06:11.140
<v Speaker 5>approximating acceptable and you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>clued in enough to pay attention.</v>

1114
01:06:11.141 --> 01:06:14.800
<v Speaker 5>So when someone raises an eyebrow or</v>
<v Speaker 5>does it find your job funny or something</v>

1115
01:06:14.801 --> 01:06:18.970
<v Speaker 5>rather subtle like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you immediately revise your identity.</v>

1116
01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:22.030
<v Speaker 5>And we're always nudging and tapping</v>
<v Speaker 5>each other nonstop,</v>

1117
01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:25.000
<v Speaker 5>exchanging information about how to stay</v>
<v Speaker 5>sane.</v>

1118
01:06:25.450 --> 01:06:29.470
<v Speaker 5>And if I'm forced into a position where</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have to validate your identity,</v>

1119
01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:32.170
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what if your identity is wrong?</v>

1120
01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:35.620
<v Speaker 5>What if it's pathological?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What if it doesn't serve you well?</v>

1121
01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:38.320
<v Speaker 5>And I start validating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think I'm your friend.</v>

1122
01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:42.220
<v Speaker 5>I'm not your friend at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a mirror for your narcissism and you</v>

1123
01:06:42.221 --> 01:06:45.820
<v Speaker 5>will disappear and drown.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I see this happening all the time</v>

1124
01:06:45.821 --> 01:06:48.160
<v Speaker 5>with people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you're fortunate,</v>

1125
01:06:48.161 --> 01:06:52.930
<v Speaker 5>you're surrounded by people who like you</v>
<v Speaker 5>now and wish you'd be a little better</v>

1126
01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:57.160
<v Speaker 5>and they'll let you know when you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>failing on that and then you think you</v>

1127
01:06:57.161 --> 01:06:59.620
<v Speaker 5>don't even have to think that much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All you have to use watch.</v>

1128
01:06:59.621 --> 01:07:02.670
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is this person like rolling their eyes?</v>

1129
01:07:02.671 --> 01:07:05.800
<v Speaker 5>It that's a bad one that predicts</v>
<v Speaker 5>divorce by the way.</v>

1130
01:07:06.010 --> 01:07:08.950
<v Speaker 5>And you get to Ireland and stage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not good.</v>

1131
01:07:09.370 --> 01:07:10.720
<v Speaker 5>But basically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know you're,</v>

1132
01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:13.970
<v Speaker 5>you're fortunate that people don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>validate your damn identity.</v>

1133
01:07:13.971 --> 01:07:16.920
<v Speaker 5>It's like what makes you think you've</v>
<v Speaker 5>caught your identity?</v>

1134
01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.810
<v Speaker 5>Figure note,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're really complicated and you're</v>

1135
01:07:19.811 --> 01:07:23.800
<v Speaker 5>clueless as hell about it because he</v>
<v Speaker 5>can't represent yourself entirely.</v>

1136
01:07:24.070 --> 01:07:26.530
<v Speaker 5>You're the most complicated thing that</v>
<v Speaker 5>exists.</v>

1137
01:07:26.890 --> 01:07:30.280
<v Speaker 5>How are you going to come up with an</v>
<v Speaker 5>accurate definition of your identity?</v>

1138
01:07:30.690 --> 01:07:33.010
<v Speaker 5>You got a hundred people out there</v>
<v Speaker 5>helping you out.</v>

1139
01:07:33.011 --> 01:07:36.670
<v Speaker 5>If you've got any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're vaguely tolerable and you know</v>

1140
01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:40.600
<v Speaker 5>they're kind of hinting at you what not</v>
<v Speaker 5>only what you are but what you might</v>

1141
01:07:40.601 --> 01:07:42.190
<v Speaker 5>become.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man,</v>

1142
01:07:42.191 --> 01:07:44.650
<v Speaker 5>you should welcome invalidation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>validation of your identity.</v>

1143
01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:47.460
<v Speaker 5>Now malicious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well that's a different story but it's,</v>

1144
01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:52.180
<v Speaker 5>it's not that easy to separate out</v>
<v Speaker 5>accurate criticism,</v>

1145
01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:55.420
<v Speaker 5>especially if it hits you right where it</v>
<v Speaker 5>hurts,</v>

1146
01:07:55.421 --> 01:07:58.410
<v Speaker 5>which is where you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't separating that out</v>

1147
01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:01.450
<v Speaker 5>maliciousness or hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like good luck,</v>

1148
01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:05.080
<v Speaker 5>good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You never learned anything without pain.</v>

1149
01:08:05.890 --> 01:08:09.460
<v Speaker 5>And often when you receive a piece of</v>
<v Speaker 5>corrective information from someone,</v>

1150
01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:11.620
<v Speaker 5>so like if you could throw that person</v>
<v Speaker 5>in jail,</v>

1151
01:08:11.621 --> 01:08:13.870
<v Speaker 5>you would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't mean they're wrong.</v>

1152
01:08:14.350 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 5>So do you have a question?</v>

1153
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:16.933
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the question.</v>

1154
01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:21.290
<v Speaker 6>So looking at the past three years,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cause we do have that benefit,</v>

1155
01:08:21.291 --> 01:08:25.100
<v Speaker 6>but we have the human race Rev.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know there has been case law but it</v>

1156
01:08:25.101 --> 01:08:27.170
<v Speaker 6>hasn't just been pronoun use,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1157
01:08:27.171 --> 01:08:29.120
<v Speaker 6>It's attached to other forms of</v>
<v Speaker 6>harassment.</v>

1158
01:08:29.121 --> 01:08:32.450
<v Speaker 6>So I would kind of pause it that that's</v>
<v Speaker 6>what we're going to see,</v>

1159
01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:36.410
<v Speaker 6>that it's going to be usually cases of</v>
<v Speaker 6>employers or uh,</v>

1160
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:39.230
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hockey Canada and not allowing a mentor,</v>

1161
01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:43.040
<v Speaker 6>someone who identifies as a man took to</v>
<v Speaker 6>change in the locker room,</v>

1162
01:08:43.041 --> 01:08:44.480
<v Speaker 6>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So does,</v>

1163
01:08:44.570 --> 01:08:46.490
<v Speaker 6>does that change your opinion knowing</v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

1164
01:08:46.491 --> 01:08:48.470
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so far with the case all we do have,</v>

1165
01:08:48.471 --> 01:08:50.990
<v Speaker 6>has it been a freedom of speech,</v>
<v Speaker 6>isolated incident?</v>

1166
01:08:51.230 --> 01:08:52.340
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't,</v>

1167
01:08:52.341 --> 01:08:54.380
<v Speaker 5>although I'm not disagreeing with what</v>
<v Speaker 5>you said.</v>

1168
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:56.960
<v Speaker 5>The problem is as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1169
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:58.940
<v Speaker 5>and this isn't something I addressed</v>
<v Speaker 5>earlier,</v>

1170
01:08:58.950 --> 01:09:03.950
<v Speaker 5>is that bad legislation will be cooptive</v>
<v Speaker 5>by people you just cast and despise.</v>

1171
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.190
<v Speaker 5>And so even if these people are</v>
<v Speaker 5>reasonable,</v>

1172
01:09:07.250 --> 01:09:10.130
<v Speaker 5>as soon as problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as soon as you put bad law in place,</v>

1173
01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:15.110
<v Speaker 5>bad people rushing to enforce it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so you're basically stating while</v>

1174
01:09:15.111 --> 01:09:18.030
<v Speaker 5>there's a human rights organization,</v>
<v Speaker 5>say it's so,</v>

1175
01:09:18.031 --> 01:09:21.230
<v Speaker 5>so societal organization,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's been reasonable and it's,</v>

1176
01:09:21.231 --> 01:09:23.510
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a decision so far,</v>

1177
01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.790
<v Speaker 5>which are not completely convinced the</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>

1178
01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:28.430
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they made some mistakes that happens.</v>

1179
01:09:28.850 --> 01:09:32.900
<v Speaker 5>But the idea that under the current</v>
<v Speaker 5>legal conditions with this particular</v>

1180
01:09:32.901 --> 01:09:35.900
<v Speaker 5>legislation in place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those are the same people that are going</v>

1181
01:09:35.901 --> 01:09:38.420
<v Speaker 5>to be running it in the near future is</v>
<v Speaker 5>wrong,</v>

1182
01:09:39.350 --> 01:09:43.580
<v Speaker 5>is that people who want this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>power will rush in to take it.</v>

1183
01:09:44.210 --> 01:09:45.860
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it always happens.</v>

1184
01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:47.930
<v Speaker 5>So it certainly happened in this</v>
<v Speaker 5>situation.</v>

1185
01:09:47.931 --> 01:09:50.570
<v Speaker 5>It's like imagine an insurance company.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you're,</v>

1186
01:09:50.571 --> 01:09:53.420
<v Speaker 5>you worked for an insurance company and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to decide if grandma gets her</v>

1187
01:09:53.421 --> 01:09:55.280
<v Speaker 5>cancer treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1188
01:09:55.281 --> 01:09:58.040
<v Speaker 5>if you're the least bit compassionate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your last,</v>

1189
01:09:58.041 --> 01:10:03.041
<v Speaker 5>call it 15 minutes and not yours because</v>
<v Speaker 5>every day you're making absolutely</v>

1190
01:10:03.710 --> 01:10:06.380
<v Speaker 5>brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>brutal decisions and you have to,</v>

1191
01:10:06.381 --> 01:10:09.290
<v Speaker 5>because the insurance company doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>have an infinite amount of money.</v>

1192
01:10:09.890 --> 01:10:11.540
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so what happens to people in those</v>

1193
01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:16.541
<v Speaker 5>positions while either quit or they get</v>
<v Speaker 5>hard hearted as hell or people who can</v>

1194
01:10:17.841 --> 01:10:20.630
<v Speaker 5>do just that with no problem occupy the</v>
<v Speaker 5>positions?</v>

1195
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:23.240
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the same situation here.</v>

1196
01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:27.380
<v Speaker 5>Bad legislation makes bad rulers and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>think this legislation is,</v>

1197
01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:28.833
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1198
01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:31.640
<v Speaker 5>it's so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's almost unbelievable.</v>

1199
01:10:31.641 --> 01:10:35.120
<v Speaker 5>You know that if you're an employer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're basically responsible for all the</v>

1200
01:10:35.121 --> 01:10:39.650
<v Speaker 5>inaction or action of your employees.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they offend someone,</v>

1201
01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:42.320
<v Speaker 5>whether or not that offense is</v>
<v Speaker 5>documented or not,</v>

1202
01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:46.280
<v Speaker 5>whether or not it was intended,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like who would write a piece of</v>

1203
01:10:46.281 --> 01:10:50.600
<v Speaker 5>legislation like that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well you can read the Ontario Human</v>

1204
01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:53.600
<v Speaker 5>Rights Commission's policies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's their quick plain as day.</v>

1205
01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:57.320
<v Speaker 5>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't trust the legislation at all and</v>

1206
01:10:57.321 --> 01:10:59.400
<v Speaker 5>I don't believe that it would be</v>
<v Speaker 5>reasonably enforced.</v>

1207
01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:01.760
<v Speaker 5>I think the courts will take it apart</v>
<v Speaker 5>over time,</v>

1208
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:07.270
<v Speaker 5>but</v>
<v Speaker 5>it will cost some one and it could have</v>

1209
01:11:07.971 --> 01:11:12.971
<v Speaker 5>been me and still might be a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot so</v>

1210
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.020
<v Speaker 3>and other people will suffer while</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's happening.</v>

1211
01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:18.330
<v Speaker 3>That's how I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how I see you.</v>

1212
01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:20.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you've had your hand up for a long</v>

1213
01:11:20.641 --> 01:11:22.640
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

1214
01:11:22.710 --> 01:11:24.900
<v Speaker 3>even though I disagree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you very much for coming to speak</v>

1215
01:11:24.901 --> 01:11:25.960
<v Speaker 3>with us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1216
01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:29.360
<v Speaker 3>I had sort of two quick points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them like be more planning</v>

1217
01:11:29.370 --> 01:11:31.500
<v Speaker 3>question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was interesting in response</v>

1218
01:11:31.501 --> 01:11:33.720
<v Speaker 3>to an earlier question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said something about pronouns being</v>

1219
01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:36.420
<v Speaker 3>a linguistically closed category.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was an interesting</v>

1220
01:11:36.421 --> 01:11:39.060
<v Speaker 3>concept because we've all been using the</v>
<v Speaker 3>singular you all night,</v>

1221
01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:41.220
<v Speaker 3>even though that historically didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>exist in English.</v>

1222
01:11:41.221 --> 01:11:44.070
<v Speaker 3>So clearly things do change for announce</v>
<v Speaker 3>do change.</v>

1223
01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:48.200
<v Speaker 3>But my question for you is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your concern was that pronouns could be</v>

1224
01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:50.880
<v Speaker 3>a sort of eliminate this category,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or at least that was my understanding.</v>

1225
01:11:51.210 --> 01:11:53.340
<v Speaker 3>We have limitless categories all over</v>
<v Speaker 3>the place.</v>

1226
01:11:53.370 --> 01:11:55.800
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the charter recognizes that individual</v>

1227
01:11:55.801 --> 01:11:57.750
<v Speaker 3>people's conceptions of religion can</v>
<v Speaker 3>differ.</v>

1228
01:11:57.930 --> 01:12:00.510
<v Speaker 3>Names are limitless category.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1229
01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:04.440
<v Speaker 3>so why prone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why pronouns in particular concern.</v>

1230
01:12:04.441 --> 01:12:06.810
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't accept the front and</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone else tells you,</v>

1231
01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:09.990
<v Speaker 3>where should you get the pronoun to</v>
<v Speaker 3>refer to them as if they are not the</v>

1232
01:12:09.991 --> 01:12:10.824
<v Speaker 3>source of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What it's,</v>

1233
01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:12.030
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't well</v>

1234
01:12:12.030 --> 01:12:14.550
<v Speaker 5>care what pronouns people want to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>addressed by.</v>

1235
01:12:14.551 --> 01:12:19.551
<v Speaker 5>And of course they have different names,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not required by forced to use</v>

1236
01:12:19.741 --> 01:12:21.750
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's the fundamental</v>

1237
01:12:21.751 --> 01:12:24.330
<v Speaker 5>characteristic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like it isn't whether or not you</v>

1238
01:12:24.331 --> 01:12:26.400
<v Speaker 5>can decide to use whatever pronouns you</v>
<v Speaker 5>want,</v>

1239
01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:28.350
<v Speaker 5>but you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that isn't what we're discussing.</v>

1240
01:12:28.351 --> 01:12:30.730
<v Speaker 5>We're discussing whether or not I should</v>
<v Speaker 5>be required by force.</v>

1241
01:12:30.731 --> 01:12:33.600
<v Speaker 5>Do you use the same pronouns?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's no such thing as a limitless</v>

1242
01:12:33.601 --> 01:12:34.590
<v Speaker 5>category,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

1243
01:12:35.070 --> 01:12:37.050
<v Speaker 5>that's an impossibility because a</v>
<v Speaker 5>category,</v>

1244
01:12:37.170 --> 01:12:39.540
<v Speaker 5>you read your post modernists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they figured this out.</v>

1245
01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:42.240
<v Speaker 5>Categories,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you acquire limits and limits,</v>

1246
01:12:42.241 --> 01:12:44.940
<v Speaker 5>exclude and marginalize.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the central doctrine of</v>

1247
01:12:44.941 --> 01:12:47.370
<v Speaker 5>postmodernism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so they're the critics of</v>

1248
01:12:47.371 --> 01:12:49.500
<v Speaker 5>categorization and that's why I'm</v>
<v Speaker 5>bringing them up.</v>

1249
01:12:49.630 --> 01:12:53.310
<v Speaker 5>If you know they're not friends of</v>
<v Speaker 5>categorization,</v>

1250
01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:56.670
<v Speaker 5>I'm making the argument for the enemies</v>
<v Speaker 5>of categorization.</v>

1251
01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:59.310
<v Speaker 5>And so there's no such thing as a</v>
<v Speaker 5>limitless category,</v>

1252
01:12:59.430 --> 01:13:03.600
<v Speaker 5>which is also actually by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why the lgbt acronym universe keeps</v>

1253
01:13:04.050 --> 01:13:08.100
<v Speaker 5>multiplying is because they're actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's actually happening is that there</v>

1254
01:13:08.101 --> 01:13:11.550
<v Speaker 5>is a category which you might consider</v>
<v Speaker 5>normative sexual behavior,</v>

1255
01:13:11.551 --> 01:13:15.120
<v Speaker 5>traditional sexual behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's those who do not fit into</v>

1256
01:13:15.121 --> 01:13:16.020
<v Speaker 5>that category as well.</v>

1257
01:13:16.050 --> 01:13:18.870
<v Speaker 5>No one fits into that category.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the category,</v>

1258
01:13:19.050 --> 01:13:22.920
<v Speaker 5>it's a category without limits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That excluded is a category without</v>

1259
01:13:22.921 --> 01:13:24.210
<v Speaker 5>limits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not a category.</v>

1260
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:28.800
<v Speaker 5>It falls apart of the total in court.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It tends towards infinite multiplicity.</v>

1261
01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:32.790
<v Speaker 5>It has to because it contains an</v>
<v Speaker 5>infinite multiplicity and that will</v>

1262
01:13:32.791 --> 01:13:35.640
<v Speaker 5>manifest itself across time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1263
01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:38.310
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then with regards to,</v>

1264
01:13:38.370 --> 01:13:40.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why we use the pronouns we used,</v>

1265
01:13:40.351 --> 01:13:41.430
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well who knows?</v>

1266
01:13:41.490 --> 01:13:42.920
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1267
01:13:42.930 --> 01:13:46.050
<v Speaker 5>it's partly I don't buy the youth thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

1268
01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:48.040
<v Speaker 5>cause it was valid before that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

1269
01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:50.640
<v Speaker 5>so there was still a marker in the same</v>
<v Speaker 5>linguistic category,</v>

1270
01:13:50.641 --> 01:13:52.490
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and technically they are close to</v>

1271
01:13:52.491 --> 01:13:54.300
<v Speaker 5>linguistic categories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if they change,</v>

1272
01:13:54.301 --> 01:13:56.550
<v Speaker 5>they change very slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But whatever,</v>

1273
01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:58.320
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to seed that.</v>

1274
01:13:58.330 --> 01:14:02.970
<v Speaker 5>But technically I think it's erroneous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can they transform much slower than</v>

1275
01:14:02.971 --> 01:14:05.000
<v Speaker 5>other categories for?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let's put it that way.</v>

1276
01:14:05.730 --> 01:14:09.480
<v Speaker 5>So where do these come from?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's common to use the comments,</v>

1277
01:14:09.481 --> 01:14:11.590
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like everyone decided that over</v>

1278
01:14:11.591 --> 01:14:13.870
<v Speaker 5>some extended period of time and it</v>
<v Speaker 5>seems to work.</v>

1279
01:14:13.871 --> 01:14:16.870
<v Speaker 5>So people use it to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's certainly not because of</v>

1280
01:14:16.871 --> 01:14:20.920
<v Speaker 5>subjective decision.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's an element yet obviously,</v>

1281
01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:26.230
<v Speaker 5>but it's only one who knows how many</v>
<v Speaker 5>elements we don't know.</v>

1282
01:14:26.650 --> 01:14:28.020
<v Speaker 5>Manny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1283
01:14:30.610 --> 01:14:32.300
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we're out of time.</v>

1284
01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:34.570
<v Speaker 3>Thank you very much for our participants</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Jack</v>

1285
01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:39.720
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

1286
01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:51.010
<v Speaker 3>Herr Professor Party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Argue devil's advocate because no other</v>

1287
01:14:51.011 --> 01:14:56.011
<v Speaker 3>law professor was willing to argue</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think we all three agreed that</v>

1288
01:14:56.471 --> 01:14:59.890
<v Speaker 3>this was a very important conversation</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was very satisfying.</v>

1289
01:15:00.190 --> 01:15:02.200
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you'd like to see more provocative</v>

1290
01:15:02.201 --> 01:15:04.960
<v Speaker 3>debates or get involved with us worth</v>
<v Speaker 3>thriving newsroom,</v>

1291
01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:08.290
<v Speaker 3>they're writing needs society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We will be hosting our student</v>

1292
01:15:08.291 --> 01:15:11.350
<v Speaker 3>leadership conference in the summer in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the country in Ontario.</v>

1293
01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:14.670
<v Speaker 3>Do we have a lot of things around?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So thank you very much for coming.</v>
