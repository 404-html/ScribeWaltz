1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.223
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm speaking with MFA and you may </v>

2
00:00:03.541 --> 00:00:04.374
<v Speaker 1>remember that Dr Jay had invited me </v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile back to speak at Ryerson </v>

3
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.420
<v Speaker 1>University on a Saturday and that's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rather popular youtube video and um,</v>

4
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.260
<v Speaker 1>he's been defending me and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and making comments about free speech on</v>

5
00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:22.350
<v Speaker 1>the Ontario Psychological Association </v>
<v Speaker 1>listserv.</v>

6
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.360
<v Speaker 1>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I got the details right,</v>

7
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.090
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you could tell everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's been happening.</v>

8
00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:27.924
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

9
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.331
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

10
00:00:29.331 --> 00:00:30.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in November,</v>

11
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.170
<v Speaker 2>one of our members that will put out her</v>
<v Speaker 2>name,</v>

12
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.440
<v Speaker 2>but she wrote a piece where she </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically,</v>

13
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.000
<v Speaker 2>I'll just say what I wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

14
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.220
<v Speaker 2>she basically said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

15
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.243
<v Speaker 2>that you shouldn't have a forum for </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussing what you were supposed to </v>

16
00:00:44.391 --> 00:00:45.224
<v Speaker 2>discuss and that was the top of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have the University of </v>

17
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.733
<v Speaker 2>Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the debate,</v>

18
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.320
<v Speaker 2>the debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

19
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.220
<v Speaker 2>And so she wrote a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

20
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.220
<v Speaker 2>a piece,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

21
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.120
<v Speaker 2>and put online and she posted it to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>list serve and I essentially wrote in my</v>

22
00:00:59.121 --> 00:00:59.954
<v Speaker 2>email to the list or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've written a number of comments about </v>

23
00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:03.550
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

24
00:01:03.551 --> 00:01:05.930
<v Speaker 2>and mostly I've been saying every time </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

25
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.870
<v Speaker 2>one of your stories comes up or another </v>
<v Speaker 2>similar story comes up,</v>

26
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm posting it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're saying,</v>

27
00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:11.960
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what's going on,</v>

28
00:01:11.961 --> 00:01:12.794
<v Speaker 2>this is not some mad ramblings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a legitimate concern about </v>

29
00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:20.840
<v Speaker 2>ideology run amok.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And either I get met by silence or I get</v>

30
00:01:20.841 --> 00:01:21.560
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

31
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.230
<v Speaker 2>ask me why I'm so angry or why I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking it so personally.</v>

32
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.150
<v Speaker 2>Or I get people emailing me back </v>
<v Speaker 2>channel,</v>

33
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.940
<v Speaker 2>mostly older people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the oldest psychologists who say</v>

34
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.923
<v Speaker 2>we support you completely over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid to say anything because of the </v>

35
00:01:32.331 --> 00:01:33.164
<v Speaker 2>consequences.</v>

36
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.273
<v Speaker 1>And what do you think they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What consequences do you think they're </v>

37
00:01:36.231 --> 00:01:37.064
<v Speaker 1>afraid of</v>

38
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.020
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

39
00:01:39.021 --> 00:01:39.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

40
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.550
<v Speaker 2>some of them work with these colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

41
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.393
<v Speaker 2>others may be trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>professorships or trying to get tenure </v>

42
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.123
<v Speaker 2>and they were afraid that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people who do a hold positions in </v>

43
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.930
<v Speaker 2>academia could hold them down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the biggest,</v>

44
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.143
<v Speaker 1>it's a perverse effect of the tenure </v>
<v Speaker 1>system because it tends to silence </v>

45
00:01:56.561 --> 00:01:57.394
<v Speaker 1>people before they have tenure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then of course they practice </v>

46
00:02:00.581 --> 00:02:03.130
<v Speaker 1>being silent and by the time they do </v>
<v Speaker 1>have tenure,</v>

47
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.070
<v Speaker 1>if you've practiced being silent for </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight or 10 years,</v>

48
00:02:06.071 --> 00:02:07.990
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or six years for that matter,</v>

49
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:10.450
<v Speaker 1>then it's going to be pretty hard to </v>
<v Speaker 1>break that habit.</v>

50
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.890
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>

51
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.130
<v Speaker 1>so what are they objecting to with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to your postings?</v>

52
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.093
<v Speaker 2>So whenever I post something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it starts off pretty neutrally and I've </v>

53
00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:22.950
<v Speaker 2>written a long a message to the Ontario </v>
<v Speaker 2>Psychological Association.</v>

54
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:25.440
<v Speaker 2>I sent it to the president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I asked them to read it to them,</v>

55
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.563
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are convening or they had convened </v>

56
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:28.780
<v Speaker 2>a meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

57
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.990
<v Speaker 2>to deal with this issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

58
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was very,</v>

59
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:33.300
<v Speaker 2>very long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

60
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.810
<v Speaker 2>I have not actually done anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I post links to stories such as yours,</v>

61
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:41.811
<v Speaker 2>like the last Friday one at mcmaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then somebody goes one of two ways.</v>

62
00:02:42.301 --> 00:02:45.990
<v Speaker 2>Either somebody will impugn my character</v>
<v Speaker 2>or my motives.</v>

63
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.023
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>recently somebody had implied that your </v>

64
00:02:49.471 --> 00:02:50.304
<v Speaker 2>message is full of hate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They actually use that word and someone </v>

65
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:54.640
<v Speaker 2>who has hate in his heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

66
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.290
<v Speaker 2>so and by extension myself or they will </v>
<v Speaker 2>ask a question and I will address it,</v>

67
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.900
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>mischaracterizing what I'm stating.</v>

68
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 2>And so I will simply say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

69
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:06.400
<v Speaker 2>I did not say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Show me where I said that.</v>

70
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:09.070
<v Speaker 2>And more often than not they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>picking on any specific issue.</v>

71
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 2>It's just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the theme because on the Old Pa,</v>

72
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:16.060
<v Speaker 2>apparently if you're on one side of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue it's okay.</v>

73
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.790
<v Speaker 2>If you occupy a different position they </v>
<v Speaker 2>won't accept it.</v>

74
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.100
<v Speaker 1>And so what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think has is going to happen</v>

75
00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:22.934
<v Speaker 1>and what have people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said that they've convened in </v>

76
00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.680
<v Speaker 1>our so called emergency meeting about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this issue.</v>

77
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.550
<v Speaker 1>And so do you have any idea why it's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>emergency and,</v>

78
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.990
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what,</v>

79
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.310
<v Speaker 1>what they're planning to do?</v>

80
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.293
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they consider an emergency </v>

81
00:03:37.171 --> 00:03:38.004
<v Speaker 2>because I'm one of the board members.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's the one who wrote that piece </v>

82
00:03:40.831 --> 00:03:42.240
<v Speaker 2>saying that you shouldn't have this </v>
<v Speaker 2>debate.</v>

83
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.283
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she took umbrage at a post that I wrote </v>

84
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.840
<v Speaker 2>where she's from noisy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

85
00:03:48.841 --> 00:03:50.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't say this like they're not being </v>
<v Speaker 2>facetious,</v>

86
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.530
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't always eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And another person from Boise</v>

87
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.930
<v Speaker 1>instituted this studies in education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For those of you who don't know,</v>

88
00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.280
<v Speaker 1>you might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were feeling charitable,</v>

89
00:03:59.281 --> 00:04:02.460
<v Speaker 1>you would recall it regardless as </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologically possessed.</v>

90
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.670
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

91
00:04:04.671 --> 00:04:05.504
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

92
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.363
<v Speaker 2>so she's from and she's the one who </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote the piece and then somebody else </v>

93
00:04:08.391 --> 00:04:10.590
<v Speaker 2>will always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wrote what anybody,</v>

94
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.060
<v Speaker 2>any reasonable person would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>

95
00:04:13.061 --> 00:04:14.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fair comment,</v>

96
00:04:14.151 --> 00:04:15.800
<v Speaker 2>which is basically trying to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

97
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.550
<v Speaker 2>can we all just be a bit more polite in </v>
<v Speaker 2>our tone,</v>

98
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.393
<v Speaker 2>more respectful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she listened to five points that we </v>

99
00:04:21.231 --> 00:04:23.510
<v Speaker 2>should all aspire to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I don't disagree with,</v>

100
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.920
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is she's also from noisy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a subtext to the message,</v>

101
00:04:27.921 --> 00:04:30.710
<v Speaker 2>which is basically this message is </v>
<v Speaker 2>directed at me.</v>

102
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.750
<v Speaker 2>So what I did was I wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

103
00:04:32.751 --> 00:04:36.590
<v Speaker 2>she posted this after the president had </v>
<v Speaker 2>already shut down the discussion.</v>

104
00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.130
<v Speaker 2>As soon as he shuts it down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really attract,</v>

105
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.993
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to say anything but to </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people put postings on and they </v>

106
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.610
<v Speaker 2>directly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

107
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically,</v>

108
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:47.390
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

109
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.870
<v Speaker 2>they mischaracterize me and they looked </v>
<v Speaker 2>me and tried to make me look bad.</v>

110
00:04:50.871 --> 00:04:54.170
<v Speaker 2>And so I spoke out and in one of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>pieces I said to her,</v>

111
00:04:54.171 --> 00:04:55.730
<v Speaker 2>if you really believe in what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

112
00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:56.713
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please make sure you apply this to the </v>

113
00:04:57.621 --> 00:05:01.130
<v Speaker 2>people who are on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones we're calling to shut down this</v>

114
00:05:01.131 --> 00:05:02.210
<v Speaker 2>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

115
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.053
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

116
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.920
<v Speaker 1>the president of the OPA shut down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion.</v>

117
00:05:05.921 --> 00:05:08.740
<v Speaker 1>What exactly does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does he,</v>

118
00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:10.660
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does he do that?</v>

119
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Why did he do it?</v>

120
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he sends out an email and says,</v>

121
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.840
<v Speaker 2>please,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is getting a bit out of hand.</v>

122
00:05:17.841 --> 00:05:20.450
<v Speaker 2>Will you please not talk about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's about the extent of it.</v>

123
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.780
<v Speaker 2>And reasonable people will refrain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't even say reasonable.</v>

124
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.870
<v Speaker 2>Let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

125
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.100
<v Speaker 2>people are trying not to cause conflict </v>
<v Speaker 2>will,</v>

126
00:05:27.101 --> 00:05:28.880
<v Speaker 2>we'll stop posting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I have done.</v>

127
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.520
<v Speaker 2>And their concern is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the tone gets out of hand.</v>

128
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.200
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's any tone.</v>

129
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.810
<v Speaker 2>The worst she can say about my tone is </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's blunt.</v>

130
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.860
<v Speaker 2>There's no name calling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's literally every single time I say,</v>

131
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.820
<v Speaker 2>show me where I said this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

132
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.651
<v Speaker 2>or if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

133
00:05:42.651 --> 00:05:46.400
<v Speaker 2>you're mischaracterizing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or I say your argument is irrational,</v>

134
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.410
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically,</v>

135
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.131
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

136
00:05:49.131 --> 00:05:51.680
<v Speaker 2>don't appeal to emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're dealing with facts here.</v>

137
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.060
<v Speaker 2>Let's deal with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

138
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:54.200
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the team.</v>

139
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:54.420
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

140
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.210
<v Speaker 1>do you have any examples of this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you've posted that you could</v>

141
00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:00.590
<v Speaker 1>share with us?</v>

142
00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:02.630
<v Speaker 2>Certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in one of the postings,</v>

143
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.473
<v Speaker 2>so this woman who again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>posting something that seemed </v>

144
00:06:04.441 --> 00:06:05.760
<v Speaker 2>reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

145
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.410
<v Speaker 2>I basically said to her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said some,</v>

146
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.180
<v Speaker 2>I'll just read this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of paragraphs.</v>

147
00:06:09.181 --> 00:06:11.370
<v Speaker 2>Some members might find my direct </v>
<v Speaker 2>rational,</v>

148
00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:12.204
<v Speaker 2>logical and fact based fact based </v>
<v Speaker 2>messages not only with respect to the </v>

149
00:06:15.271 --> 00:06:16.104
<v Speaker 2>issues themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also with respect to claims made by </v>

150
00:06:17.851 --> 00:06:19.890
<v Speaker 2>those who disagree with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>

151
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.903
<v Speaker 2>when I respectfully state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please show me where I said or did this </v>

152
00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.770
<v Speaker 2>to be rude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>offensive or inappropriate,</v>

153
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.990
<v Speaker 2>which to me is a gross misuse of such </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms.</v>

154
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.093
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of those same people have directly </v>

155
00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:32.460
<v Speaker 2>stated or implied that I am a </v>
<v Speaker 2>misogynist.</v>

156
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.120
<v Speaker 2>I transfer a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>

157
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.120
<v Speaker 2>hateful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reprehensible,</v>

158
00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.043
<v Speaker 2>unreasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and unwilling or unable to engage in </v>

159
00:06:38.671 --> 00:06:39.504
<v Speaker 2>respectful discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next step is where I got where </v>

160
00:06:42.031 --> 00:06:44.340
<v Speaker 2>things got heated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said moreover,</v>

161
00:06:44.341 --> 00:06:45.200
<v Speaker 2>and I mentioned the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

162
00:06:45.201 --> 00:06:47.160
<v Speaker 2>the colleague I alluded to a few minutes</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

163
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.313
<v Speaker 2>I'm explicitly stated on this with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>survey in November that she did not </v>

164
00:06:50.671 --> 00:06:51.504
<v Speaker 2>believe that Jordan Peterson should have</v>
<v Speaker 2>been given a forum to discuss what any </v>

165
00:06:54.571 --> 00:06:58.170
<v Speaker 2>reasonable person would agree is far </v>
<v Speaker 2>from an unequivocal issue.</v>

166
00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:59.543
<v Speaker 2>She posted a link.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I posted it to an online article she co </v>

167
00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.540
<v Speaker 2>wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is critical,</v>

168
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:04.603
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stated her reasons for what most </v>

169
00:07:05.761 --> 00:07:06.594
<v Speaker 2>objective people should find a </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerning call for censorship of not </v>

170
00:07:09.211 --> 00:07:10.044
<v Speaker 2>only non hateful ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also scientific investigation and </v>

171
00:07:13.081 --> 00:07:13.914
<v Speaker 2>discussion as well as civil debate about</v>
<v Speaker 2>poorly conceptualizing worded </v>

172
00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.180
<v Speaker 2>legislation that could potentially cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>unforeseen harm.</v>

173
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:22.733
<v Speaker 2>I wrote that and her response was she </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually posted a response and I hadn't </v>

174
00:07:27.121 --> 00:07:28.560
<v Speaker 2>heard from her for quite some time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>let me just read it.</v>

175
00:07:28.561 --> 00:07:29.394
<v Speaker 2>She posted or an annotate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have just as much right to express my </v>

176
00:07:32.461 --> 00:07:35.910
<v Speaker 2>opinion as anyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I already put you on notice once,</v>

177
00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.280
<v Speaker 2>but I will say it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please leave me alone.</v>

178
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.250
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think led to the emergency</v>
<v Speaker 2>meeting and you know,</v>

179
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.143
<v Speaker 2>look at the context I have every right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have just as much right to express my </v>

180
00:07:47.001 --> 00:07:48.890
<v Speaker 2>opinion as anyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with that.</v>

181
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.950
<v Speaker 2>But why would she be calling for other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people not to have that same?</v>

182
00:07:51.951 --> 00:07:53.840
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They bought prosy is astounding.</v>

183
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:55.520
<v Speaker 2>And so Carolyn,</v>

184
00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:59.670
<v Speaker 2>I really don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They may ask me to,</v>

185
00:07:59.671 --> 00:08:00.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

186
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.780
<v Speaker 2>to leave the LPA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They may ask me to leave the LISTSERV.</v>

187
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of the OPA strongest advocates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

188
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.053
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time I'm in the media I will </v>

189
00:08:08.131 --> 00:08:10.770
<v Speaker 2>mention the work that they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do a lot of excellent work,</v>

190
00:08:10.771 --> 00:08:11.604
<v Speaker 2>including the presence so that he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's done excellent work for </v>

191
00:08:14.101 --> 00:08:16.260
<v Speaker 2>homelessness and for promoting </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology.</v>

192
00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:19.650
<v Speaker 2>So the worst they can do is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is try to pick me out.</v>

193
00:08:19.651 --> 00:08:24.651
<v Speaker 2>I know that this member in question was </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to enact something against me.</v>

194
00:08:25.651 --> 00:08:26.310
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

195
00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:29.340
<v Speaker 2>some sensor like more formal censure it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it never happened.</v>

196
00:08:29.341 --> 00:08:30.460
<v Speaker 2>Aside from a public review.</v>

197
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.400
<v Speaker 1>Precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

198
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.860
<v Speaker 1>you read some of the things that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>written.</v>

199
00:08:36.861 --> 00:08:40.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it that you're being targeted?</v>

200
00:08:40.671 --> 00:08:42.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first for an emergency meeting,</v>

201
00:08:42.381 --> 00:08:45.260
<v Speaker 1>which seems a bit like overkill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but perhaps it isn't,</v>

202
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.040
<v Speaker 1>but what is it that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it that they have on you?</v>

203
00:08:49.041 --> 00:08:53.090
<v Speaker 1>So to speak that would result in </v>
<v Speaker 1>centering of that sort?</v>

204
00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.290
<v Speaker 2>They literally have nothing because I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>not called anybody names.</v>

205
00:08:58.291 --> 00:08:59.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

206
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.350
<v Speaker 2>even when I called the a member </v>
<v Speaker 2>immature,</v>

207
00:09:01.351 --> 00:09:02.184
<v Speaker 2>I didn't name them at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the worst they can say is the tone </v>

208
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:08.190
<v Speaker 2>might become a bit hostile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is what worries me.</v>

209
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:08.940
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

210
00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.620
<v Speaker 2>I might be forceful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might be blunt,</v>

211
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.450
<v Speaker 2>I might be repetitive and verbose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I stick to the facts.</v>

212
00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:16.930
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and right.</v>

213
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.023
<v Speaker 2>And the problem is those facts are on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the wrong side of their ideology and </v>

214
00:09:20.641 --> 00:09:21.474
<v Speaker 2>that's what's propelling them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can tell you them and the other </v>

215
00:09:23.551 --> 00:09:26.970
<v Speaker 2>thing is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so as I mentioned that he receives quote</v>

216
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:30.870
<v Speaker 2>unquote dozens of complaints from </v>
<v Speaker 2>members who this is what is incredible,</v>

217
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.450
<v Speaker 2>who are basically saying that they do </v>
<v Speaker 2>not want,</v>

218
00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.593
<v Speaker 2>they can't tolerate the distress that </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes along with knowing that I'm </v>

219
00:09:36.781 --> 00:09:40.500
<v Speaker 2>writing emails to the LISTSERV and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they might give up their membership.</v>

220
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:43.590
<v Speaker 2>This is a kind of issue that's going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

221
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.513
<v Speaker 2>if you look at my posts and I've written</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the OPA and every time someone </v>

222
00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:48.720
<v Speaker 2>criticizes me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I specifically write,</v>

223
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:52.590
<v Speaker 2>show me one thing that I've written </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's inappropriate or offensive.</v>

224
00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:57.640
<v Speaker 1>No one's ever called and they can't and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a record of all these postings.</v>

225
00:09:57.641 --> 00:09:59.500
<v Speaker 1>I presume I have them all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

226
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.750
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything in them that you would</v>

227
00:10:01.751 --> 00:10:02.584
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that you've written that you </v>

228
00:10:03.401 --> 00:10:07.480
<v Speaker 1>would be unwilling to make public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming that you could get rid of names</v>

229
00:10:07.481 --> 00:10:08.314
<v Speaker 1>and so on that might identify people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything that would make you </v>

230
00:10:10.571 --> 00:10:12.490
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable about revealing publicly?</v>

231
00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.673
<v Speaker 2>The only thing I'd be concerned about is</v>
<v Speaker 2>making sure that we're not violating </v>

232
00:10:16.661 --> 00:10:17.494
<v Speaker 2>some ethical code,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I guess would be portraying a </v>

233
00:10:20.711 --> 00:10:22.840
<v Speaker 2>psychologist or a psychologist in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative light.</v>

234
00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this qualifies as that.</v>

235
00:10:25.931 --> 00:10:29.200
<v Speaker 2>I think this is having an honest </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion about a personal.</v>

236
00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.600
<v Speaker 1>You would only be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would suspect,</v>

237
00:10:33.601 --> 00:10:34.434
<v Speaker 1>responsible for portraying psychology in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a negative light if your portrayal was </v>

238
00:10:38.491 --> 00:10:42.450
<v Speaker 1>unfounded from a factual perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would presume,</v>

239
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:47.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable leeway in a,</v>

240
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.500
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a policy of that sort.</v>

241
00:10:49.501 --> 00:10:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Although the problem is those things are</v>
<v Speaker 1>subject to interpretation.</v>

242
00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.760
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's my concern is,</v>

243
00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:59.860
<v Speaker 2>is that interpretation I will seek legal</v>
<v Speaker 2>counsel.</v>

244
00:10:59.861 --> 00:11:04.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if our coverage applies to </v>
<v Speaker 2>such a situation.</v>

245
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:05.363
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I will ask the lawyers that we have </v>

246
00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.690
<v Speaker 2>insurance for and see if this would </v>
<v Speaker 2>count as that.</v>

247
00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:11.640
<v Speaker 2>I really don't.</v>

248
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.810
<v Speaker 1>What's happened to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if anything,</v>

249
00:11:13.811 --> 00:11:17.080
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence for hosting me at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ryerson.</v>

250
00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a lot of attention.</v>

251
00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:24.300
<v Speaker 2>The only consequence is that people have</v>
<v Speaker 2>been thanking me for being someone who's</v>

252
00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:25.373
<v Speaker 2>standing out and saying you're standing </v>
<v Speaker 2>up and saying we need to have this </v>

253
00:11:27.601 --> 00:11:30.060
<v Speaker 2>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing so far.</v>

254
00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.053
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's good.</v>

255
00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:32.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's two.</v>

256
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.660
<v Speaker 2>Now the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

257
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.630
<v Speaker 2>my next contract is coming due at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ryerson.</v>

258
00:11:37.631 --> 00:11:39.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm cinema,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sessional lecturer.</v>

259
00:11:39.041 --> 00:11:41.220
<v Speaker 2>I've been teaching it for 15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

260
00:11:41.221 --> 00:11:42.054
<v Speaker 2>I always get the positions I applied for</v>
<v Speaker 2>it because I've taught so far off on a </v>

261
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:48.210
<v Speaker 2>total of 160 courses at universities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excellent reviews.</v>

262
00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.730
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I find this term,</v>

263
00:11:50.731 --> 00:11:53.290
<v Speaker 2>that's the first time ever that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>get the positions I applied for,</v>

264
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.680
<v Speaker 2>that's the consequence we will find out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that they would do that.</v>

265
00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:57.933
<v Speaker 2>I think we have a pretty strong union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't have tenure as we were </v>

266
00:11:59.981 --> 00:12:00.814
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a secure position and I've </v>

267
00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:05.110
<v Speaker 2>got a very busy clinical practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to stop teaching,</v>

268
00:12:05.111 --> 00:12:08.350
<v Speaker 2>to be not to be able to communicate with</v>
<v Speaker 2>students who want to learn,</v>

269
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.333
<v Speaker 2>who wanted to learn about critical </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking and being motivated to </v>

270
00:12:11.621 --> 00:12:13.720
<v Speaker 2>challenge ideas that be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

271
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:14.980
<v Speaker 2>a horrible consequence.</v>

272
00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:15.571
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

273
00:12:15.571 --> 00:12:16.920
<v Speaker 1>there's always youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

274
00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:23.660
<v Speaker 1>what facing you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is certainly possible with you've</v>

275
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:24.503
<v Speaker 1>got something to say that people need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hear and it actually constitutes </v>

276
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.550
<v Speaker 1>reasonable quality education that in in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

277
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:31.703
<v Speaker 1>I would not say precisely in a pinch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly is an alternative and </v>

278
00:12:34.741 --> 00:12:36.620
<v Speaker 1>you have full control over that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

279
00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:39.090
<v Speaker 1>it'd be very interesting to see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens with your,</v>

280
00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:43.230
<v Speaker 1>with your contract renewal and we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly have another talk at that time</v>

281
00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:47.100
<v Speaker 1>whether it goes badly or whether it goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>well either way.</v>

282
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.490
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think's going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you?</v>

283
00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.820
<v Speaker 1>What do you think's going to happen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you overall as a consequence of this?</v>

284
00:12:53.821 --> 00:12:55.980
<v Speaker 1>What are you afraid of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if anything?</v>

285
00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:59.023
<v Speaker 2>I mean the worst that could happen is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that somehow the college decides that </v>

286
00:13:01.041 --> 00:13:01.940
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

287
00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.910
<v Speaker 2>this warrants some kind of heavy </v>
<v Speaker 2>sanctions.</v>

288
00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:05.773
<v Speaker 2>That would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

289
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:07.670
<v Speaker 2>somehow I lost my registration over </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

290
00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:13.260
<v Speaker 1>That's the college of psychologists got </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in Ontario rather than just the</v>

291
00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:16.463
<v Speaker 1>Ontario Psychological Association </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the college for everyone who's </v>

292
00:13:17.581 --> 00:13:18.414
<v Speaker 1>listening to colleges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body that regulates our clinical </v>

293
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.633
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical psychologists licensure in </v>

294
00:13:23.971 --> 00:13:28.050
<v Speaker 1>Ontario,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to have them make any action against</v>

295
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.430
<v Speaker 1>one of their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>

296
00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.710
<v Speaker 1>one of the licensed psychologists and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ontario,</v>

297
00:13:31.711 --> 00:13:33.210
<v Speaker 1>that can be a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very serious thing.</v>

298
00:13:33.211 --> 00:13:34.044
<v Speaker 1>That was definitely something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>worried me while it still worries me to </v>

299
00:13:36.151 --> 00:13:36.984
<v Speaker 1>some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly worried me a lot back in </v>

300
00:13:38.971 --> 00:13:42.480
<v Speaker 1>October and November when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the remote was more negative,</v>

301
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:45.390
<v Speaker 1>when the university was responding </v>
<v Speaker 1>negatively,</v>

302
00:13:45.391 --> 00:13:47.460
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to what I was doing and sending me those</v>

303
00:13:47.461 --> 00:13:48.810
<v Speaker 1>warning letters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

304
00:13:48.811 --> 00:13:50.790
<v Speaker 1>so far nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing has come of that.</v>

305
00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:51.840
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

306
00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:53.381
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

307
00:13:53.381 --> 00:13:57.540
<v Speaker 2>and that's the only real yes it is know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And practically speaking,</v>

308
00:13:57.541 --> 00:14:00.180
<v Speaker 2>let's say the Ontario Psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>Association Listserv,</v>

309
00:14:00.181 --> 00:14:02.940
<v Speaker 2>the LPA lists or um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people send out referrals.</v>

310
00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:04.043
<v Speaker 2>And so if I'm qualified to deal with one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the cases that they send out to you </v>

311
00:14:07.111 --> 00:14:11.210
<v Speaker 2>can be guaranteed that certain people </v>
<v Speaker 2>will not pass that referral by way of,</v>

312
00:14:11.211 --> 00:14:13.320
<v Speaker 2>I met my practice is busy enough as it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

313
00:14:13.321 --> 00:14:14.700
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be a potential consequence.</v>

314
00:14:14.701 --> 00:14:17.210
<v Speaker 2>This is why other people might not want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to speak out.</v>

315
00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.830
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm applying it</v>

316
00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:21.510
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is this sort of thing that,</v>

317
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.390
<v Speaker 1>that is why people don't want to speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

318
00:14:24.391 --> 00:14:25.230
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also,</v>

319
00:14:25.231 --> 00:14:26.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get letters,</v>

320
00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:28.223
<v Speaker 1>hordes of letters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dozens of letters from people who say </v>

321
00:14:30.721 --> 00:14:33.690
<v Speaker 1>exactly that if they're afraid to speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>their mind,</v>

322
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:34.583
<v Speaker 1>students and students and people from </v>
<v Speaker 1>all other walks of life who are afraid </v>

323
00:14:37.681 --> 00:14:38.514
<v Speaker 1>to speak their mind because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>targeted by my people who have </v>

324
00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.570
<v Speaker 1>censorship on their mind and malice in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their hearts,</v>

325
00:14:45.571 --> 00:14:46.404
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who are willing to use whatever </v>

326
00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:51.560
<v Speaker 1>means necessary to intimidate people </v>
<v Speaker 1>whose opinions they don't agree with.</v>

327
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.350
<v Speaker 1>So exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really not good.</v>

328
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:57.990
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what's worrying me is that the,</v>

329
00:14:57.991 --> 00:14:59.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the OPA OPA.</v>

330
00:14:59.301 --> 00:15:00.134
<v Speaker 2>And what I can tell from the comments </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people don't see what you're </v>

331
00:15:02.541 --> 00:15:02.970
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

332
00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:05.740
<v Speaker 2>I think they think you're being </v>
<v Speaker 2>hyperbolic reactionary.</v>

333
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

334
00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:07.743
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>show me one case and now the thing is </v>

335
00:15:09.261 --> 00:15:11.420
<v Speaker 2>they always apply it to the transgender </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>

336
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.433
<v Speaker 2>And I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please try to see it at a different </v>

337
00:15:13.851 --> 00:15:16.310
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just to put transgenders you,</v>

338
00:15:16.311 --> 00:15:19.540
<v Speaker 2>that's just the context under which it </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>

339
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.760
<v Speaker 2>But the actual issue,</v>

340
00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:23.980
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was about preferred pronouns.</v>

341
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:28.480
<v Speaker 1>It would've died out in about a week and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't died out at all.</v>

342
00:15:28.481 --> 00:15:29.314
<v Speaker 1>Quite the contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone with any sense knows perfectly </v>

343
00:15:31.481 --> 00:15:34.660
<v Speaker 1>well that this is about far more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>and preferred pronouns.</v>

344
00:15:34.661 --> 00:15:37.610
<v Speaker 1>That just happened to be the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does your,</v>

345
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.473
<v Speaker 1>so to speak?</v>

346
00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:39.843
<v Speaker 2>And.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

347
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.040
<v Speaker 2>But I have to say though that the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>recent,</v>

348
00:15:42.041 --> 00:15:42.874
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I posted the talks that you had on </v>

349
00:15:44.201 --> 00:15:45.034
<v Speaker 2>Friday at mcmaster university where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>shamefully a shut you down and you </v>

350
00:15:50.321 --> 00:15:54.280
<v Speaker 2>weren't able to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I posted that somebody wrote me and</v>

351
00:15:54.281 --> 00:15:55.114
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they wrote to me privately and then </v>

352
00:15:56.081 --> 00:15:56.914
<v Speaker 2>publicly on the lists are asking me </v>
<v Speaker 2>about why won't you just say they are </v>

353
00:16:00.671 --> 00:16:03.760
<v Speaker 2>focusing on that even though we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>cruise is a deeper issue.</v>

354
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.090
<v Speaker 2>This is the rigidity with which they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing this issue.</v>

355
00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:12.480
<v Speaker 1>A reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reaction.</v>

356
00:16:12.481 --> 00:16:13.314
<v Speaker 1>Why won't he just say they to viewing </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened at mcmaster university is </v>

357
00:16:17.311 --> 00:16:19.740
<v Speaker 1>a little bit on the peculiar side I </v>
<v Speaker 1>might say.</v>

358
00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:21.300
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

359
00:16:21.301 --> 00:16:21.960
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

360
00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.180
<v Speaker 1>what do they say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swallowing a camel.</v>

361
00:16:24.181 --> 00:16:25.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>straining at a nap.</v>

362
00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:28.440
<v Speaker 1>I think that's how that saying goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

363
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

364
00:16:30.541 --> 00:16:31.374
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so is there anything else that you </v>

365
00:16:32.251 --> 00:16:33.084
<v Speaker 1>wanted to talk about tonight or is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that basically cover your concerns </v>

366
00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:39.480
<v Speaker 1>and describe what's been happening to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you reasonably well?</v>

367
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:41.440
<v Speaker 2>I think it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

368
00:16:41.441 --> 00:16:42.274
<v Speaker 2>and I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll look into it and see what I'm able </v>

369
00:16:44.471 --> 00:16:45.304
<v Speaker 2>to maybe post publicly so that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>can see what kind of discussions are </v>

370
00:16:47.921 --> 00:16:48.910
<v Speaker 2>being had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

371
00:16:48.911 --> 00:16:50.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't put any names,</v>

372
00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:51.920
<v Speaker 2>it will just simply be no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

373
00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.400
<v Speaker 2>this is the manner in which we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

374
00:16:54.401 --> 00:16:55.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're communicating.</v>

375
00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:56.470
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

376
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:57.303
<v Speaker 1>managed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be that people can judge for </v>

377
00:16:58.731 --> 00:17:00.360
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

378
00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:02.960
<v Speaker 1>because at the moment it's sort of he </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

379
00:17:02.961 --> 00:17:04.520
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not great.</v>

380
00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.593
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not like mean certainly I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to what you say and believe </v>

381
00:17:08.781 --> 00:17:09.614
<v Speaker 1>that you're portraying it accurately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's much better for people to be </v>

382
00:17:12.801 --> 00:17:16.340
<v Speaker 1>able to make that judgment themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be,</v>

383
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:17.203
<v Speaker 1>that would be a useful thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assuming that you can do it without </v>

384
00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:24.800
<v Speaker 1>compromising yourself or anyone else in </v>
<v Speaker 1>any unreasonable manner.</v>

385
00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.113
<v Speaker 1>But I also don't think it's unreasonable</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make things like this public because </v>

386
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:30.613
<v Speaker 1>quality can make something public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really have to wonder what's going </v>

387
00:17:32.601 --> 00:17:33.434
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if there's a restriction against </v>

388
00:17:36.801 --> 00:17:40.730
<v Speaker 1>sharing what's been happening on what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>more or less a public,</v>

389
00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:41.863
<v Speaker 1>it's more or less a public forum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that it's part of the Ontario </v>

390
00:17:45.021 --> 00:17:45.854
<v Speaker 1>psychological association,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not exactly private </v>

391
00:17:48.081 --> 00:17:50.410
<v Speaker 1>communication and if you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>

392
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.473
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to get in trouble for </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're posting and it's </v>

393
00:17:53.731 --> 00:17:55.770
<v Speaker 1>unreasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be useful for people to be able</v>

394
00:17:55.771 --> 00:17:58.480
<v Speaker 1>to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can decide that so.</v>

395
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:01.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry Jordan,</v>

396
00:18:01.841 --> 00:18:05.420
<v Speaker 2>if I can say one more thing just because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do want to be fair to,</v>

397
00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:06.450
<v Speaker 2>to sell then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

398
00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:11.530
<v Speaker 2>as I alluded to earlier is concerned is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it might be violating some OPA.</v>

399
00:18:11.531 --> 00:18:12.364
<v Speaker 2>OPA is hosted by the APA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the American psychological association </v>

400
00:18:14.351 --> 00:18:17.020
<v Speaker 2>lists or for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's concerned that,</v>

401
00:18:17.021 --> 00:18:18.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it might be violating that.</v>

402
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:21.880
<v Speaker 2>So for him shutting things down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no problem with that.</v>

403
00:18:21.881 --> 00:18:24.430
<v Speaker 2>If he's worried about that reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>

404
00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:25.320
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

405
00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.910
<v Speaker 2>I guess the message coming from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other members,</v>

406
00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:28.953
<v Speaker 2>which is essentially they themselves are</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying they shut it down because we </v>

407
00:18:32.291 --> 00:18:35.860
<v Speaker 2>don't want to hear it and they think I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>being just to again too arrogant or,</v>

408
00:18:35.861 --> 00:18:37.090
<v Speaker 2>or forceful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

409
00:18:37.091 --> 00:18:37.924
<v Speaker 2>that's not the real reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real reason is that they don't like </v>

410
00:18:39.821 --> 00:18:41.990
<v Speaker 2>what I have to say and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

411
00:18:41.991 --> 00:18:42.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

412
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:43.630
<v Speaker 2>I understand the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

413
00:18:43.631 --> 00:18:45.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ostensible reason for which,</v>

414
00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:46.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

415
00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:46.481
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

416
00:18:46.481 --> 00:18:47.314
<v Speaker 2>they're shutting down the discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to make sure I'm clear on </v>

417
00:18:48.971 --> 00:18:50.560
<v Speaker 2>that and I don't want to misrepresent </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

418
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:51.543
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're saying.</v>

419
00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.121
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

420
00:18:53.121 --> 00:18:56.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's hard to hard to know what to</v>

421
00:18:56.991 --> 00:18:58.610
<v Speaker 1>say about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate,</v>

422
00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:00.220
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate what you're saying about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

423
00:19:00.221 --> 00:19:01.054
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it still seems to me that the whole </v>

424
00:19:01.911 --> 00:19:02.744
<v Speaker 1>point of a list service so that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>can communicate their ideas and I do </v>

425
00:19:07.581 --> 00:19:08.414
<v Speaker 1>believe that we're entering an age where</v>
<v Speaker 1>forceful discussion is going to be </v>

426
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:13.790
<v Speaker 1>regarded as somehow will oppressive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>violent.</v>

427
00:19:13.791 --> 00:19:14.624
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is it's very difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>to discuss anything of importance </v>

428
00:19:17.031 --> 00:19:19.100
<v Speaker 1>without a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>forcefulness,</v>

429
00:19:19.101 --> 00:19:19.934
<v Speaker 1>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is also directness and bluntness and </v>

430
00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.080
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's to the point.</v>

431
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:28.470
<v Speaker 1>And we certainly don't want to interfere</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that and otherwise.</v>

432
00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for obvious reasons,</v>

433
00:19:29.931 --> 00:19:31.970
<v Speaker 1>for obvious reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

434
00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.890
<v Speaker 1>Well thanks very much for talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and I,</v>

435
00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:35.793
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'll know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll know very soon exactly how this </v>

436
00:19:37.971 --> 00:19:41.090
<v Speaker 1>went and maybe I can talk to you again </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we find out.</v>

437
00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.550
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you an update to find out </v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

438
00:19:43.551 --> 00:19:44.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they decide.</v>
