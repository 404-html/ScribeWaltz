1
00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.213
<v Speaker 1>That we will explore today is in many </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways what I'm trying to figure out some </v>

2
00:00:05.821 --> 00:00:09.510
<v Speaker 1>of the deepest implications of what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>means to be a human being.</v>

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.070
<v Speaker 1>When we first formed the ocf worth our </v>
<v Speaker 1>fellowship last year,</v>

4
00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:17.430
<v Speaker 1>one of the discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the very first discussions we had</v>

5
00:00:17.431 --> 00:00:22.431
<v Speaker 1>at our weekly meeting was one that dealt</v>
<v Speaker 1>with how we see ourselves today,</v>

6
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.490
<v Speaker 1>how we in our society and especially as </v>
<v Speaker 1>students have lost something very sacred</v>

7
00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:32.670
<v Speaker 1>about ourselves and many currents of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought annual.</v>

8
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.990
<v Speaker 1>Certainly in our hyper rationalized </v>
<v Speaker 1>deconstructed postmodern world,</v>

9
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.003
<v Speaker 1>one loses sight of the meaning of not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only those things which are external to </v>

10
00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:43.710
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the process we fail to understand</v>

11
00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:44.544
<v Speaker 1>the very core of Rv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of you will know that recently Dr. </v>

12
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson has faced an amended set</v>
<v Speaker 1>of controversy precisely for questioning</v>

13
00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:54.414
<v Speaker 1>the dogmas of our age and yet he has </v>
<v Speaker 1>also stressed the importance of the </v>

14
00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:03.000
<v Speaker 1>divine individual and the Christian </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept of the logos,</v>

15
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.880
<v Speaker 1>which I will allow our speakers to </v>
<v Speaker 1>elaborate upon today.</v>

16
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.650
<v Speaker 1>A dear friend had told me once that one </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally divides orthodoxy from any</v>

17
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:15.030
<v Speaker 1>other kind of videology is precisely </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

18
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.073
<v Speaker 1>the dignity of the divine individual and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what this means for us as spiritual and </v>

19
00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:24.000
<v Speaker 1>physical beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm immensely excited to be here.</v>

20
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:25.620
<v Speaker 1>One are timeless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to say the ninth.</v>

21
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.203
<v Speaker 1>And so I'd like to introduce each of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>panelists starting with Father Theodore </v>

22
00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:31.194
<v Speaker 1>across govopoly is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is adjunct faculty of the Orthodox </v>

23
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.940
<v Speaker 1>School of theology at the Trinity </v>
<v Speaker 1>College.</v>

24
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.043
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last semester he taught a course on the </v>

25
00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:42.150
<v Speaker 1>human person in Orthodox theology and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Orthodox tradition.</v>

26
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.200
<v Speaker 1>And in many ways it's something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>touches upon orange,</v>

27
00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:48.810
<v Speaker 1>reduces the very core of what's being </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed today,</v>

28
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.990
<v Speaker 1>what is the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean to be human?</v>

29
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.943
<v Speaker 1>And he is also quite a positive presence</v>
<v Speaker 1>at our institution fellowship and we </v>

30
00:01:56.731 --> 00:01:59.850
<v Speaker 1>certainly look forward to hearing his </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective tonight.</v>

31
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.473
<v Speaker 1>Jonathon Hijo is a very well known icon </v>
<v Speaker 1>carver from Quebec as well as an editor </v>

32
00:02:06.571 --> 00:02:07.404
<v Speaker 1>for the Orthodox Arts Journal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of us were familiar with the </v>

33
00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:11.274
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan and his work prior to this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was a great pleasure to have him </v>

34
00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:17.280
<v Speaker 1>here tonight and indeed it is entirely </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate.</v>

35
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.473
<v Speaker 1>Just this past Sunday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Orthodox Church celebrated in the </v>

36
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:23.970
<v Speaker 1>spirit of unity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Sunday of Orthodoxy,</v>

37
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.080
<v Speaker 1>the celebration of our triumph over </v>
<v Speaker 1>iconoclasm.</v>

38
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.643
<v Speaker 1>The tradition of iconography in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>orthodox tradition is one of the </v>

39
00:02:31.701 --> 00:02:32.534
<v Speaker 1>theology and I'm very pleased at an </v>
<v Speaker 1>expert on the matter is with us here </v>

40
00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:36.654
<v Speaker 1>today and many of you may be interested </v>
<v Speaker 1>to hear Jonathan's online discussion </v>

41
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.340
<v Speaker 1>with Dr. Peters and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most recent one being concerned with</v>

42
00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:47.170
<v Speaker 1>one of the most controversial political </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbols of this day,</v>

43
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.400
<v Speaker 1>the metaphysics of Pepe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Jordan B.</v>

44
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Peterson is a professor of psychology </v>
<v Speaker 1>here at the University of Toronto.</v>

45
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.023
<v Speaker 1>And I think it goes without saying that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the activism of Dr. Peterson has </v>

46
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:01.420
<v Speaker 1>inspired many in the room today.</v>

47
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.633
<v Speaker 1>Manny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who would have previously perhaps not </v>

48
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:04.683
<v Speaker 1>even considered looking into the type of</v>
<v Speaker 1>concepts which are going to be </v>

49
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.073
<v Speaker 1>discussing today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Myself and many others have been deeply </v>

50
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:14.920
<v Speaker 1>moved by not only Dr Peterson's insight </v>
<v Speaker 1>on matters of a political nature,</v>

51
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.993
<v Speaker 1>but also in his insight in human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The title of this discussion was </v>

52
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:21.544
<v Speaker 1>influenced by Dr Peterson's usage of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>constant of the Christian concept of </v>

53
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.300
<v Speaker 1>logos and what that means for us as </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals.</v>

54
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:29.763
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to thank Dr. Peters and for </v>
<v Speaker 1>joining us and we are greatly looking </v>

55
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:34.300
<v Speaker 1>forward to hearing more of your insight </v>
<v Speaker 1>on this map.</v>

56
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.180
<v Speaker 1>Last but not least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Father Jeffrey Ready,</v>

<v Speaker 1>School of theology.</v>

58
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:41.543

<v Speaker 1>Jeff.</v>

62
00:03:52.981 --> 00:03:53.814
<v Speaker 1>He has continuously blown our minds and </v>
<v Speaker 1>enhanced our understanding not only of </v>

63
00:03:56.861 --> 00:04:01.330
<v Speaker 1>our orthodox spiritual life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of ourselves as human beings.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Apart from his remarkable Pesaro </v>
<v Speaker 1>qualities,</v>

65
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.063
<v Speaker 1>his wealth of knowledge and perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>has made it only natural that we would </v>

66
00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:10.300
<v Speaker 1>offer his perspective on this panel </v>
<v Speaker 1>tonight.</v>

67
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.970
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to thank all the Jeffrey for </v>
<v Speaker 1>his work and great league.</v>

<v Speaker 1>tonight.</v>

69
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:17.703

<v Speaker 1>will be basically that each of our </v>

70
00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:21.994
<v Speaker 1>panelists will speak for for a time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this will be followed by a question and </v>

<v Speaker 1>answer period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each of you will have received a few </v>

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.660
<v Speaker 1>and each row has about two ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for the duration of the discussion,</v>

74
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.720
<v Speaker 1>you can write down your questions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pass them up at the front and then we'll</v>

<v Speaker 3>Thank you to the ocf at uft for asking </v>

00:05:12.421 --> 00:05:13.254
<v Speaker 3>me to come and to be up here on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stage with people that I kind of feel I </v>

84
00:05:16.111 --> 00:05:18.060
<v Speaker 3>feel outclassed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>

85
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.963
<v Speaker 3>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

86
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.590
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate the invitation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

87
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.433
<v Speaker 3>so I was told to speak for like 10 to 15</v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes about what it means to be a </v>

88
00:05:26.611 --> 00:05:30.480
<v Speaker 3>human person in the orthodox tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know how possible that is.</v>

89
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.630
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but live just mentioned that,</v>

90
00:05:35.631 --> 00:05:36.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the past,</v>

91
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two days on Sunday,</v>

92
00:05:38.821 --> 00:05:41.040
<v Speaker 3>we celebrated any of the Orthodox </v>
<v Speaker 3>tradition,</v>

93
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.380
<v Speaker 3>the Sunday of Orthodoxy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the first Sunday in lent.</v>

94
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.843
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for those of you who don't know what </v>

95
00:05:45.721 --> 00:05:47.400
<v Speaker 3>that is or don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll be celebrating that day,</v>

96
00:05:47.401 --> 00:05:51.360
<v Speaker 3>we celebrate the return of the holy </v>
<v Speaker 3>icons into the church.</v>

97
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.283
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people who've been to Orthodox </v>

98
00:05:52.541 --> 00:05:55.350
<v Speaker 3>churches know that the church is full of</v>
<v Speaker 3>icons and they wonder,</v>

99
00:05:55.351 --> 00:05:56.184
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when was there a turn and why was there </v>

100
00:05:57.651 --> 00:05:59.310
<v Speaker 3>a return considering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

101
00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.110
<v Speaker 3>to be ever not have.</v>

102
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.943
<v Speaker 3>Though of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christians have had images in their </v>

103
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.360
<v Speaker 3>churches and in their places of worship </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the very beginning.</v>

104
00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.810
<v Speaker 3>But there was a time that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

105
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.550
<v Speaker 3>there was an impression of the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 3>using images as a,</v>

106
00:06:12.551 --> 00:06:15.080
<v Speaker 3>and it was considered for the idolatry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you from the church.</v>

107
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.670
<v Speaker 3>And there was a faction within the </v>
<v Speaker 3>church that I'm a font against this.</v>

108
00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:23.360
<v Speaker 3>And for almost a hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a icons were burned,</v>

109
00:06:23.361 --> 00:06:25.430
<v Speaker 3>destroyed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and taken out of churches.</v>

110
00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:27.530
<v Speaker 3>And it was only with the seventh </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ecumenical Council,</v>

111
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.120
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they were returned.</v>

112
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.253
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why did we celebrate this on Sunday of </v>

113
00:06:31.521 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 3>Orthodoxy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what'd we call it,</v>

114
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:37.010
<v Speaker 3>Sunday of Orthodoxy is because those who</v>
<v Speaker 3>are the proponents of icons,</v>

115
00:06:37.011 --> 00:06:42.011
<v Speaker 3>and of course all modern Orthodox </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christians today knew that the attack on</v>

116
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.590
<v Speaker 3>the depiction of Christ was an attack on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the incarnation itself.</v>

117
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:46.953
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that Christ is an actual mean </v>

118
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.700
<v Speaker 3>actually existed actually live and </v>
<v Speaker 3>lives.</v>

119
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.860
<v Speaker 3>He was an actual historical figure who </v>
<v Speaker 3>live at a certain time and not a figment</v>

120
00:06:57.861 --> 00:07:00.590
<v Speaker 3>of our imagination as some people today </v>
<v Speaker 3>would say.</v>

121
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:06.070
<v Speaker 3>And this means that when we speak about </v>
<v Speaker 3>God and when we speak about the trinity,</v>

122
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:08.480
<v Speaker 3>when you speak about the second person </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the Trinity,</v>

123
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.300
<v Speaker 3>who is the son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the locals,</v>

124
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.230
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we were speaking about tonight,</v>

125
00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:13.443
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are speaking about a very specific </v>

126
00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:16.460
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

127
00:07:16.461 --> 00:07:17.294
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is in contrast to many of the </v>

128
00:07:20.091 --> 00:07:25.091
<v Speaker 3>discussions that we see today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both in the Public Forum online,</v>

129
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's symposia like this,</v>

130
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we,</v>

131
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:28.813
<v Speaker 3>where many people would like to think of</v>
<v Speaker 3>God as an abstract for Orthodox </v>

132
00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:33.650
<v Speaker 3>Christians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would say for,</v>

133
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>historical ancient Christianity,</v>

134
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.950
<v Speaker 3>God is not an aspect that either God is </v>
<v Speaker 3>an actual person,</v>

135
00:07:39.951 --> 00:07:43.790
<v Speaker 3>there's an objective reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their prices and objective person,</v>

136
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.640
<v Speaker 3>he thinks a certain way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>speaks a certain way,</v>

137
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.070
<v Speaker 3>act a certain way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even looked a certain way,</v>

138
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.140
<v Speaker 3>and so we can depict an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an icon.</v>

139
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.050
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason why I started with this and I</v>

140
00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:55.310
<v Speaker 3>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

141
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>begin,</v>

142
00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:56.923
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my thoughts is a because there is a </v>

143
00:08:00.531 --> 00:08:05.510
<v Speaker 3>little bit of a contrast between many </v>
<v Speaker 3>religions and orthodoxy.</v>

144
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:06.920
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not,</v>

145
00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:07.754
<v Speaker 3>this is a generalization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as generalizations go in many </v>

146
00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:13.520
<v Speaker 3>religions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they be Christian or not,</v>

147
00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.150
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the concept of God or the concept of the</v>

148
00:08:17.151 --> 00:08:22.151
<v Speaker 3>divine usually centers around the idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the word of God.</v>

149
00:08:22.281 --> 00:08:23.114
<v Speaker 3>When the concept of God made text,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there are usually writings about </v>

150
00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:29.600
<v Speaker 3>this and writings that are usually very </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient,</v>

151
00:08:29.601 --> 00:08:30.434
<v Speaker 3>they're passed down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the text is usually what is focused </v>

152
00:08:33.531 --> 00:08:35.540
<v Speaker 3>on even amongst many Christian </v>
<v Speaker 3>denominations,</v>

153
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.240
<v Speaker 3>it's all about the text.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

154
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.050
<v Speaker 3>in the orthodox tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is not about the word defending text,</v>

155
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:44.450
<v Speaker 3>but rather about the word becoming </v>
<v Speaker 3>flesh.</v>

156
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:45.493
<v Speaker 3>I mean human being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so our faith is not based on a text </v>

157
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:54.100
<v Speaker 3>of rather on a deep mystical experience </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the risen Lord throughout time.</v>

158
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.921
<v Speaker 3>Are you going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

159
00:08:55.921 --> 00:08:57.120
<v Speaker 3>we read the Bible too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

160
00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.400
<v Speaker 3>We use the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we venerate the Bible.</v>

161
00:08:59.401 --> 00:09:01.950
<v Speaker 3>We have it in very high regard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

162
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:06.870
<v Speaker 3>for ancient Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that cause I like star trek too.</v>

163
00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.690
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

164
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.120
<v Speaker 3>when we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

165
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.420
<v Speaker 3>when we speak about Christ and you speak</v>
<v Speaker 3>about God,</v>

166
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.310
<v Speaker 3>we speak about a living tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christ and found a bull.</v>

167
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:23.993
<v Speaker 3>Neither did he found the philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but rather he found it a very real </v>

168
00:09:26.551 --> 00:09:27.930
<v Speaker 3>community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a living community.</v>

169
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:29.423
<v Speaker 3>And the Orthodox Church,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last 2000 years is this living </v>

170
00:09:33.061 --> 00:09:36.180
<v Speaker 3>community that has never stopped with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has never ceased to exist.</v>

171
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.400
<v Speaker 3>It was never a time where he did not </v>
<v Speaker 3>exist.</v>

172
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.010
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have no beginning.</v>

173
00:09:41.011 --> 00:09:43.830
<v Speaker 3>We have no reformer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have no sounder.</v>

174
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.510
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have no school of thoughts,</v>

175
00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.110
<v Speaker 3>but rather a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we exist from the very beginning.</v>

176
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:49.973
<v Speaker 3>So the reason why I say this is because </v>
<v Speaker 3>our concept of God and our concept of </v>

177
00:09:54.271 --> 00:09:57.150
<v Speaker 3>our relationship to him is a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>intimate one.</v>

178
00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.570
<v Speaker 3>And one that is in living for the last </v>
<v Speaker 3>2000 years.</v>

179
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:02.400
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

180
00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:04.623
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

181
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.170
<v Speaker 3>going back to the idea of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>incarnational theology and have icons,</v>

182
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we are just saying that God is real,</v>

183
00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:15.283
<v Speaker 3>he actually exists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we don't believe in that more than </v>

184
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:17.803
<v Speaker 3>this talk doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if we believe that God exists and </v>

185
00:10:19.951 --> 00:10:20.784
<v Speaker 3>that God is an actual person is a mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his personality and that is Christ is </v>

186
00:10:25.771 --> 00:10:29.130
<v Speaker 3>God in human form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then uh,</v>

187
00:10:29.131 --> 00:10:34.131
<v Speaker 3>the reality is is that there is an </v>
<v Speaker 3>objective reality to who god is.</v>

188
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:37.343
<v Speaker 3>And by that we can say that there's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>objective truth that'd be can speak </v>

189
00:10:40.651 --> 00:10:41.484
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there is an objective good that we </v>

190
00:10:43.801 --> 00:10:44.634
<v Speaker 3>can speak about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there is an objective understanding </v>

191
00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:47.783
<v Speaker 3>of the human being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is not subjective but rather </v>

192
00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:54.870
<v Speaker 3>objective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for us as Orthodox Christians,</v>

193
00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:59.000
<v Speaker 3>we tend to follow the model that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>coined by seeing nothing else.</v>

194
00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.830
<v Speaker 3>The grades,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same as fourth century father,</v>

195
00:11:01.831 --> 00:11:02.664
<v Speaker 3>the church,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every theologian who said that God </v>

196
00:11:04.441 --> 00:11:08.640
<v Speaker 3>became man so that we may become God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that we need to come,</v>

197
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:09.850
<v Speaker 3>you'll God's like gone.</v>

198
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.393
<v Speaker 3>So for us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the goal of the Christian life is to </v>

199
00:11:12.781 --> 00:11:13.920
<v Speaker 3>emulate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

200
00:11:13.921 --> 00:11:17.850
<v Speaker 3>It's to become Christ light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not about what I think of myself as</v>

201
00:11:17.851 --> 00:11:18.684
<v Speaker 3>a lot about why I want to be or what </v>
<v Speaker 3>would I would like to create in my mind </v>

202
00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:24.300
<v Speaker 3>what I would like to be or what I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>I am,</v>

203
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.570
<v Speaker 3>but rather that there is Christ and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christ is the perfect human being.</v>

204
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:28.613
<v Speaker 3>And I tried to discover what that is and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that is diametrically opposed to </v>

205
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:37.110
<v Speaker 3>the society that we live in today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For the most part,</v>

206
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:38.183
<v Speaker 3>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we live in a society that is a </v>

207
00:11:40.501 --> 00:11:43.020
<v Speaker 3>society of subjectivity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not object.</v>

208
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.040
<v Speaker 3>And we live in a society that when he </v>
<v Speaker 3>speaks about religion,</v>

209
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.730
<v Speaker 3>speaks about spirituality in a speech </v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

210
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:50.573
<v Speaker 3>speaks about theology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It usually refers to the subjective </v>

211
00:11:54.251 --> 00:11:55.084
<v Speaker 3>understanding of God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the subjective understanding of the </v>

212
00:11:57.101 --> 00:12:02.101
<v Speaker 3>human person as Professor Peterson has </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the last few months.</v>

213
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:07.240
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when we talk about human identity,</v>

214
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:08.733
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

215
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:09.573
<v Speaker 3>it is something that is to be discovered</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not to be kind of created or self </v>

216
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.300
<v Speaker 3>created.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

217
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:18.821
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

218
00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:22.630
<v Speaker 3>there's a writing at a very early second</v>
<v Speaker 3>century writing in the church called the</v>

219
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:23.920
<v Speaker 3>heat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means the teaching,</v>

220
00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:25.513
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the earliest writings of the </v>

221
00:12:26.381 --> 00:12:29.710
<v Speaker 3>church I guess we could say is one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the earliest manuals,</v>

222
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:30.780
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

223
00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.790
<v Speaker 3>of how to be a Christian or the basics </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the Christian faith,</v>

224
00:12:33.791 --> 00:12:36.220
<v Speaker 3>I guess you could say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in the that he,</v>

225
00:12:36.221 --> 00:12:39.730
<v Speaker 3>it says the first line says there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>two ways,</v>

226
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:41.223
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of life I want to death and there's </v>

227
00:12:44.111 --> 00:12:48.370
<v Speaker 3>a great difference between the two is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the opening lines and a,</v>

228
00:12:48.371 --> 00:12:51.760
<v Speaker 3>and really when it comes to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

229
00:12:51.761 --> 00:12:52.594
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

230
00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:56.290
<v Speaker 3>the understanding of the human person </v>
<v Speaker 3>from Orthodox point of view,</v>

231
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.000
<v Speaker 3>we would say the same thing.</v>

232
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.030
<v Speaker 3>That there are really two ways to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>

233
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.313
<v Speaker 3>There is either the revelation from God </v>
<v Speaker 3>and how we emulate that or rather </v>

234
00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:11.800
<v Speaker 3>there's the movement towards the south </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards self revelation,</v>

235
00:13:11.801 --> 00:13:13.780
<v Speaker 3>self understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And really,</v>

236
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:15.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would say,</v>

237
00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.330
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>self idealization and uh,</v>

238
00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:24.331
<v Speaker 3>and soul of course we as human beings </v>
<v Speaker 3>are free to do whatever we wanted to do.</v>

239
00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:28.180
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we have free will.</v>

240
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:32.890
<v Speaker 3>But how we use that and what we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you do with it?</v>

241
00:13:32.891 --> 00:13:33.724
<v Speaker 3>And what you choose to become really </v>
<v Speaker 3>depends on where we're looking for </v>

242
00:13:38.081 --> 00:13:39.910
<v Speaker 3>words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do we want it to do and then,</v>

243
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:43.420
<v Speaker 3>and who we want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would say that the,</v>

244
00:13:43.421 --> 00:13:44.254
<v Speaker 3>the modern existential crisis of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>time can really be remedied by the </v>

245
00:13:50.231 --> 00:13:54.670
<v Speaker 3>simple statement that if there is a god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a God,</v>

246
00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:58.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm not him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the understanding of that,</v>

247
00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.233
<v Speaker 3>if there's a god and I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that him would mean that I need to </v>

248
00:14:02.591 --> 00:14:05.630
<v Speaker 3>discover who that God is and what he </v>
<v Speaker 3>expects of me.</v>

249
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.850
<v Speaker 3>Why am I here and what am I supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do with my life?</v>

250
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.313
<v Speaker 3>And that's diametrically opposed to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>subjective understanding of that God is </v>

251
00:14:16.031 --> 00:14:21.031
<v Speaker 3>whatever I wanted to do or what I would </v>
<v Speaker 3>rather him eat and go from there.</v>

252
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:27.290
<v Speaker 3>So in pre modern Western civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

253
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
<v Speaker 3>society was predominantly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

254
00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:33.100
<v Speaker 3>society of these kinds of values.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of objective truths.</v>

255
00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.500
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was kind of like the social glue that</v>

256
00:14:35.501 --> 00:14:39.490
<v Speaker 3>provided stability for the family and </v>
<v Speaker 3>social institutions and religion and,</v>

257
00:14:39.491 --> 00:14:41.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even business ethics.</v>

258
00:14:41.141 --> 00:14:43.150
<v Speaker 3>Like people believe that there was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>

259
00:14:43.151 --> 00:14:45.760
<v Speaker 3>there was a truth out there that we need</v>
<v Speaker 3>to discovered.</v>

260
00:14:45.761 --> 00:14:50.110
<v Speaker 3>There was a god that we needed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow figure out who that God was.</v>

261
00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:51.363
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the humility that was required to </v>

262
00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:57.830
<v Speaker 3>set that we are not gods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

263
00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:58.693
<v Speaker 3>was what held all that together and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>social and psychological fabric of </v>

264
00:15:01.281 --> 00:15:02.114
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>

265
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.410
<v Speaker 3>So without it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is where I think,</v>

266
00:15:06.411 --> 00:15:07.244
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a peterson would also agree in has </v>

267
00:15:08.801 --> 00:15:13.250
<v Speaker 3>said many times without this kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding of an objective reality,</v>

268
00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.150
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is an endless movement towards the</v>

269
00:15:17.151 --> 00:15:18.850
<v Speaker 3>individuals word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>subjectivities,</v>

270
00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:19.693
<v Speaker 3>tours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is relative and ultimately towards </v>

271
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.850
<v Speaker 3>nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if there is no objective meaning</v>

272
00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:27.800
<v Speaker 3>in life and there's no objective truth </v>
<v Speaker 3>in life,</v>

273
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:31.880
<v Speaker 3>then everything is whatever I made it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and everybody has right?</v>

274
00:15:31.881 --> 00:15:32.714
<v Speaker 3>And really everybody is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then really what you have to listen </v>

275
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.760
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So real ultimate meaning life.</v>

276
00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.450
<v Speaker 3>And so this is the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

277
00:15:41.451 --> 00:15:45.050
<v Speaker 3>and then there's a movement towards the </v>
<v Speaker 3>delusion that everyone has their own God</v>

278
00:15:45.051 --> 00:15:47.780
<v Speaker 3>and everyone is free to create </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves in their own image.</v>

279
00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.530
<v Speaker 3>And this breeds and this fragmentation </v>
<v Speaker 3>as professor [inaudible] said,</v>

280
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:52.743
<v Speaker 3>a volt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>socal individual truths and also </v>

281
00:15:54.171 --> 00:15:56.840
<v Speaker 3>individual identities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

282
00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.190
<v Speaker 3>if there is no god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we said,</v>

283
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:02.540
<v Speaker 3>this conversation doesn't really matter.</v>

284
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:03.823
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there is a god and he has a personal </v>

285
00:16:05.001 --> 00:16:05.834
<v Speaker 3>God as a Christian his claim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we cannot go on ignoring him </v>

286
00:16:08.961 --> 00:16:11.540
<v Speaker 3>without suffering a serious identity </v>
<v Speaker 3>crisis.</v>

287
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.823
<v Speaker 3>I believe that this crisis has arrived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the question is how do we as </v>

288
00:16:15.381 --> 00:16:19.430
<v Speaker 3>Christians continued to see the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see the word of God,</v>

289
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:22.880
<v Speaker 3>the divine logos in those who refuse to </v>
<v Speaker 3>see it in themselves?</v>

290
00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:23.714
<v Speaker 3>Like how do we speak to that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do we speak to a world that doesn't </v>

291
00:16:27.321 --> 00:16:31.420
<v Speaker 3>even</v>
<v Speaker 3>acknowledge that there is such a locals?</v>

292
00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.980
<v Speaker 3>But there is such a truth in the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

293
00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:35.413
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the conundrum that we find </v>

294
00:16:36.951 --> 00:16:40.790
<v Speaker 3>ourselves in the difficulty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do we witness to a world that is not</v>

295
00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:43.640
<v Speaker 3>speaking the same language anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that is uh,</v>

296
00:16:43.641 --> 00:16:45.170
<v Speaker 3>something that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

297
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:48.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>discussions like this are,</v>

298
00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.990
<v Speaker 3>are super important and attend the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>steps.</v>

299
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:55.990
<v Speaker 3>Because here we are attempting and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I applaud the ocf for doing this,</v>

300
00:16:56.901 --> 00:17:01.901
<v Speaker 3>attempting to find points of convergence</v>
<v Speaker 3>between a Christian tradition,</v>

301
00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:07.770
<v Speaker 3>Orthodox Christian tradition and also </v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

302
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:10.100
<v Speaker 3>the secular approach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychology,</v>

303
00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.860
<v Speaker 3>sociology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>

304
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.233
<v Speaker 3>biology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>places where these things converge and </v>

305
00:17:17.001 --> 00:17:19.490
<v Speaker 3>they'd tell us and they preach the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth.</v>

306
00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:20.893
<v Speaker 3>And this is why I was so enthused about </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming and speaking today because </v>

307
00:17:25.701 --> 00:17:28.650
<v Speaker 3>watching a lot of Festo Peterson's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

308
00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.250
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>videos online,</v>

309
00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:31.093
<v Speaker 3>I saw that there are a lot of points </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he makes that not only are </v>

310
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.490
<v Speaker 3>congruent with Orthodox theology and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Orthodox anthropology,</v>

311
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:42.520
<v Speaker 3>but speak common sense to the world in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>world that is completely fragmented,</v>

312
00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:43.693
<v Speaker 3>a world that is completely disengaged </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the idea that there can be a truth </v>

313
00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:53.810
<v Speaker 3>outside of ourselves and that there </v>
<v Speaker 3>needs to be some type of seeking,</v>

314
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.390
<v Speaker 3>some type of understanding of what that </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth may be.</v>

315
00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:58.853
<v Speaker 3>The main difference between philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 3>and theology I always tell my students </v>

316
00:18:01.951 --> 00:18:04.140
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that philosophy comes from us.</v>

317
00:18:04.141 --> 00:18:07.890
<v Speaker 3>It is us trying to understand the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to understand the metaphysical,</v>

318
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.600
<v Speaker 3>try,</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand glaad punters stand,</v>

319
00:18:09.601 --> 00:18:11.150
<v Speaker 3>anything you can philosophize about </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>

320
00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:12.373
<v Speaker 3>but the source of the human being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have this wonderful thing called the </v>

321
00:18:15.031 --> 00:18:18.780
<v Speaker 3>mind is so powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can do so many things,</v>

322
00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.740
<v Speaker 3>but that's philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Theology heals with a revelation.</v>

323
00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:24.173
<v Speaker 3>He was with what has been revealed from </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside the community of someone else </v>

324
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:28.943
<v Speaker 3>and that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what the church has to deal with </v>

325
00:18:29.971 --> 00:18:31.280
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what the Christian,</v>

326
00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:35.460
<v Speaker 3>what does Shanti has to deal with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of what God has revealed in himself</v>

327
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:39.160
<v Speaker 3>by becoming a real movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>becoming one of us have.</v>

328
00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:40.003
<v Speaker 3>We can't negate that as much as we try </v>
<v Speaker 3>and to do so would mean to negate an </v>

329
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:45.223
<v Speaker 3>important part of ourselves because we </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe as tuition is like the say all </v>

330
00:18:48.371 --> 00:18:49.204
<v Speaker 3>the time and as would like to quote </v>
<v Speaker 3>genesis where God says in the very </v>

331
00:18:52.801 --> 00:18:53.634
<v Speaker 3>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>genesis one 26 God makes man in his </v>

332
00:18:56.851 --> 00:18:58.710
<v Speaker 3>image and his likeness.</v>

333
00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:00.203
<v Speaker 3>He gives us this great ability to shoots</v>
<v Speaker 3>great of his ability to reason and to </v>

334
00:19:04.711 --> 00:19:09.711
<v Speaker 3>figure things out for ourselves and to </v>
<v Speaker 3>decide whether we want to be like him or</v>

335
00:19:10.141 --> 00:19:13.170
<v Speaker 3>whether we want to be more like </v>
<v Speaker 3>something else.</v>

336
00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:17.070
<v Speaker 3>So this is the great dilemma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just a theological dilemma,</v>

337
00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.880
<v Speaker 3>it's not just a spiritual dilemma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's an existential dilemma and it's</v>

338
00:19:20.881 --> 00:19:21.714
<v Speaker 3>becoming social dilemma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You tell me a political dilemma I </v>

339
00:19:24.931 --> 00:19:28.800
<v Speaker 3>biological dilemma and a whole lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>other climbers.</v>

340
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:31.820
<v Speaker 3>So I will end there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

341
00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:35.130
<v Speaker 3>I will let a folly Jonathan take it from</v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

342
00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:36.203
<v Speaker 3>but I think this is a general </v>
<v Speaker 3>introduction to at least the way we see </v>

343
00:19:38.611 --> 00:19:39.444
<v Speaker 3>it as Orthodox Christians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that God becomes man so that man can </v>

344
00:19:42.161 --> 00:19:44.880
<v Speaker 3>become God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The words of the Apostle Paul,</v>

345
00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:47.590
<v Speaker 3>there's lot I who live but Christ who </v>
<v Speaker 3>lives within.</v>

346
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:49.260
<v Speaker 3>And this is our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our ultimate hope.</v>

347
00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.333
<v Speaker 3>Thank you very much.</v>

348
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:55.710
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

349
00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.740
<v Speaker 4>did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thanks cory.</v>

350
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.070
<v Speaker 4>Appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate being here.</v>

351
00:20:17.071 --> 00:20:18.180
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Being in Toronto,</v>

352
00:20:18.181 --> 00:20:19.014
<v Speaker 4>it's a great town.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Today I spent the day going to the </v>

353
00:20:22.171 --> 00:20:25.080
<v Speaker 4>museum and visiting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I really enjoying the city.</v>

354
00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to start with this story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

355
00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:33.250
<v Speaker 4>it's March,</v>
<v Speaker 4>2015 and uh,</v>

356
00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:34.373
<v Speaker 4>I'm driving good to pick up my children </v>
<v Speaker 4>at some friend's house on Friday night </v>

357
00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:38.963
<v Speaker 4>and it's about half an hour drive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm settling in and I'm listening to </v>

358
00:20:41.071 --> 00:20:45.990
<v Speaker 4>the CBC like I usually do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would that particular evening,</v>

359
00:20:45.991 --> 00:20:49.690
<v Speaker 4>the content is not usually what you get </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the CDC.</v>

360
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:55.000
<v Speaker 4>So on the air,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this University of Toronto professor and</v>

361
00:20:55.001 --> 00:20:58.780
<v Speaker 4>what are you saying rings a bit off from</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I usually hear on that show.</v>

362
00:20:59.100 --> 00:20:59.933
<v Speaker 4>And at first he's talking about religion</v>
<v Speaker 4>and religious symbolism and he's doing </v>

363
00:21:04.091 --> 00:21:04.924
<v Speaker 4>it in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say he's doing it without the </v>

364
00:21:06.761 --> 00:21:10.360
<v Speaker 4>usual smugness that we tend to hear when</v>
<v Speaker 4>people talk about religion,</v>

365
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:11.223
<v Speaker 4>especially about Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so here he is talking about </v>

366
00:21:14.561 --> 00:21:17.460
<v Speaker 4>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I can tell he's not,</v>

367
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:19.810
<v Speaker 4>you're not a priest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not a preacher,</v>

368
00:21:19.811 --> 00:21:22.060
<v Speaker 4>he's a psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a scientist.</v>

369
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:27.640
<v Speaker 4>And so as a talk on folds my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say my attention heightens,</v>

370
00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:30.910
<v Speaker 4>and after a few minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a few minutes,</v>

371
00:21:30.911 --> 00:21:35.080
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe what I'm hearing as this</v>

372
00:21:35.081 --> 00:21:37.570
<v Speaker 4>profits is going to stories of Adam and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Eve,</v>

373
00:21:37.571 --> 00:21:38.404
<v Speaker 4>Cain and Abel jumping to Shakespeare and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Milton and Jerky and then to Darwin and </v>

374
00:21:43.361 --> 00:21:47.290
<v Speaker 4>Nietzsche and you'll and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and immediately I see what he's doing.</v>

375
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:49.673
<v Speaker 4>He has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just trying to communicate </v>

376
00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:55.980
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's dancing across this wide variety of</v>

377
00:21:56.260 --> 00:22:00.730
<v Speaker 4>references because what's wants to do is</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wants to bring out,</v>

378
00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:04.480
<v Speaker 4>he wants to trace this underlying </v>
<v Speaker 4>pattern</v>

379
00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:11.060
<v Speaker 4>and by doing so he's trying to awaken </v>
<v Speaker 4>something in his listeners.</v>

380
00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:13.430
<v Speaker 4>He's not just trying to get them to </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand,</v>

381
00:22:13.431 --> 00:22:16.400
<v Speaker 4>which is what we usually hear when we </v>
<v Speaker 4>listened to talks.</v>

382
00:22:16.401 --> 00:22:17.820
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's trying to provoke,</v>

383
00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:22.850
<v Speaker 4>like to shake people into experiencing </v>
<v Speaker 4>how the world is built with meaning.</v>

384
00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:28.063
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

385
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:30.770
<v Speaker 4>So he talks about logos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is true,</v>

386
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:35.830
<v Speaker 4>meaning express in words.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This search for purpose and logos,</v>

387
00:22:36.291 --> 00:22:40.640
<v Speaker 4>transforms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>transforms chaos and potentiality and to</v>

388
00:22:40.641 --> 00:22:45.641
<v Speaker 4>being and in opposition to this lies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>deceit,</v>

389
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:50.350
<v Speaker 4>resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gradually dismantle the world and plunge</v>

390
00:22:50.351 --> 00:22:54.260
<v Speaker 4>it into ever-growing chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

391
00:22:54.261 --> 00:22:55.940
<v Speaker 4>of course he's taking this from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bible,</v>

392
00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:57.253
<v Speaker 4>the Book of Genesis from the Gospel of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Saint John Sprinkled with some </v>

393
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:01.303
<v Speaker 4>phenomenology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's very clearly describing this </v>

394
00:23:05.971 --> 00:23:10.971
<v Speaker 4>process at all levels of reality</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the individual.</v>

395
00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:13.683
<v Speaker 4>The interpersonal is social,</v>
<v Speaker 4>political levels and this interaction </v>

396
00:23:17.831 --> 00:23:18.664
<v Speaker 4>between logos and chaos is the main </v>
<v Speaker 4>manner we could say by which the world </v>

397
00:23:23.351 --> 00:23:25.390
<v Speaker 4>is constantly sustained.</v>

398
00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:30.100
<v Speaker 4>So by this point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am,</v>

399
00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:32.920
<v Speaker 4>I literally cheering in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

400
00:23:32.921 --> 00:23:37.921
<v Speaker 4>I'm hitting my steering wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And all I can think is who is this?</v>

401
00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:42.970
<v Speaker 4>Who is this person talking and why have </v>
<v Speaker 4>I not heard of him before?</v>

402
00:23:42.971 --> 00:23:43.804
<v Speaker 4>Like why is he not famous?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess we don't ask that question </v>

403
00:23:46.311 --> 00:23:47.144
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

404
00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:52.550
<v Speaker 4>And especially I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how does he know this?</v>

405
00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.073
<v Speaker 4>You see like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the attempt to help people see </v>

406
00:23:55.791 --> 00:23:59.240
<v Speaker 4>experience patterns of meaning and </v>
<v Speaker 4>religious symbol is,</v>

407
00:23:59.241 --> 00:24:01.550
<v Speaker 4>or how it connects to all levels of </v>
<v Speaker 4>reality.</v>

408
00:24:01.551 --> 00:24:03.310
<v Speaker 4>That's what I've been trying to do for </v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

409
00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:05.810
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's been my goal in life.</v>

410
00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.720
<v Speaker 4>I would say in my carvings and my </v>
<v Speaker 4>articles and my talks,</v>

411
00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:10.400
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10,</v>

412
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.910
<v Speaker 4>there's only a handful of people that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>know that I can relate to at that level.</v>

413
00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:16.120
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

414
00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:16.953
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's not that people don't talk </v>

415
00:24:17.411 --> 00:24:19.990
<v Speaker 4>about religious symbolism actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people do,</v>

416
00:24:19.991 --> 00:24:24.040
<v Speaker 4>but usually when you hear people talk </v>
<v Speaker 4>about religious symbolism,</v>

417
00:24:24.041 --> 00:24:29.020
<v Speaker 4>at some point you can kind of picture </v>
<v Speaker 4>them in like a tin foil hats and then,</v>

418
00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:29.913
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

419
00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:33.040
<v Speaker 4>they soon extra terrestrials become part</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the,</v>

420
00:24:33.041 --> 00:24:34.560
<v Speaker 4>of the discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

421
00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:38.800
<v Speaker 4>but not this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's just as clear as can be.</v>

422
00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:40.053
<v Speaker 4>So when I get home,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I reach out to him and I send them </v>

423
00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.880
<v Speaker 4>just a little message.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

424
00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:48.783
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just thanking him and expressing my </v>

425
00:24:50.411 --> 00:24:53.560
<v Speaker 4>surprise and linking into a few </v>
<v Speaker 4>articles.</v>

426
00:24:53.561 --> 00:24:55.870
<v Speaker 4>I'd written a few talks I've given,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

427
00:24:55.871 --> 00:24:57.130
<v Speaker 4>that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't expect,</v>

428
00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:01.810
<v Speaker 4>I didn't really expect an answer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then the next morning I get,</v>

429
00:25:01.811 --> 00:25:06.811
<v Speaker 4>I get a message thanking me for my </v>
<v Speaker 4>message and pointing me to a few lecture</v>

430
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:09.550
<v Speaker 4>that he had given more specifically on </v>
<v Speaker 4>religion.</v>

431
00:25:09.551 --> 00:25:10.750
<v Speaker 4>I thought that's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

432
00:25:10.751 --> 00:25:12.220
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's nice.</v>

433
00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:16.420
<v Speaker 4>This was random crew,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Becker's sending messages to him.</v>

434
00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:17.673
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then about about an hour and a half </v>

435
00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.490
<v Speaker 4>later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get this call</v>

436
00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:25.570
<v Speaker 4>and I can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't do the criminal voice.</v>

437
00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:33.040
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my memories,</v>

438
00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.470
<v Speaker 4>my memories of that moment are kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>vague,</v>

439
00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.830
<v Speaker 4>but I think I probably acted like a 14 </v>
<v Speaker 4>year old meeting,</v>

440
00:25:38.831 --> 00:25:43.831
<v Speaker 4>Kanye West or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now his tone is one of surprise.</v>

441
00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:47.710
<v Speaker 4>Maybe a bit of confusion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And his basic question and,</v>

442
00:25:47.711 --> 00:25:51.460
<v Speaker 4>and he's been asking me this question </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever since is how do you know this?</v>

443
00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.073
<v Speaker 4>Because they listened to my talk and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>saw the relationship between what I was </v>

444
00:25:57.801 --> 00:26:00.860
<v Speaker 4>saying and what he was saying and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>talk.</v>

445
00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:01.933
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had been talking about how logos </v>

446
00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:09.010
<v Speaker 4>organizes potential into experience been</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

447
00:26:09.261 --> 00:26:10.880
<v Speaker 4>why am I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why am I telling you this?</v>

448
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:13.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

449
00:26:13.311 --> 00:26:16.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you this as an excuse </v>
<v Speaker 4>because despite with father,</v>

450
00:26:16.161 --> 00:26:16.994
<v Speaker 4>Ted said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's this carver who standing on one </v>

451
00:26:19.641 --> 00:26:20.474
<v Speaker 4>theologian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then professors though the reason why </v>

452
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:29.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm here is because since then professor</v>
<v Speaker 4>Peterson and I have developed this,</v>

453
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:31.610
<v Speaker 4>this relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of you might've seen the interviews</v>

454
00:26:31.611 --> 00:26:32.930
<v Speaker 4>that we did together.</v>

455
00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:34.173
<v Speaker 5>MMM.</v>

456
00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:37.910
<v Speaker 4>But mostly I'm telling you this because </v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

457
00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:39.793
<v Speaker 4>I know that it nears the story of so </v>
<v Speaker 4>many people that are probably here in </v>

458
00:26:43.201 --> 00:26:44.720
<v Speaker 4>this room and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

459
00:26:44.721 --> 00:26:47.450
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of the people that might hear </v>
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>

460
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:48.570
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on Youtube,</v>

461
00:26:48.571 --> 00:26:52.800
<v Speaker 4>we're in the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that it years.</v>

462
00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:58.010
<v Speaker 4>And I know because dozens of people have</v>
<v Speaker 4>told me of that experience,</v>

463
00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have this image,</v>

464
00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:02.463
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if people have seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of Joe Rogan hearing Dr. Peterson talk </v>

465
00:27:05.381 --> 00:27:09.220
<v Speaker 4>for the first time and his jaw dropping,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

466
00:27:09.221 --> 00:27:13.600
<v Speaker 4>and all of a sudden he sees religion in </v>
<v Speaker 4>a completely different way.</v>

467
00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.570
<v Speaker 4>And I've even received dozens of message</v>
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>

468
00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:20.560
<v Speaker 4>I would call them in process atheists </v>
<v Speaker 4>who say,</v>

469
00:27:20.561 --> 00:27:22.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mike questions.</v>

470
00:27:22.901 --> 00:27:27.790
<v Speaker 4>And my thinking had been tilted slightly</v>
<v Speaker 4>in unexpected ways.</v>

471
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:30.263
<v Speaker 4>And that experience I think has been </v>
<v Speaker 4>strongest for Orthodox Christians like </v>

472
00:27:33.571 --> 00:27:35.340
<v Speaker 4>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

473
00:27:35.341 --> 00:27:36.174
<v Speaker 4>I stopped counting the number of </v>
<v Speaker 4>messages I received from priests asking </v>

474
00:27:40.531 --> 00:27:41.630
<v Speaker 4>me soap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It says,</v>

475
00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:45.420
<v Speaker 4>Dr. Peterson Orthodox or what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And to which I usually answer,</v>

476
00:27:45.421 --> 00:27:47.160
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just likes dusty Fgli.</v>

477
00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:52.060
<v Speaker 4>And there was even one clergy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>clergy men who who,</v>

478
00:27:52.061 --> 00:27:54.530
<v Speaker 4>who answered to that said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

479
00:27:54.531 --> 00:27:56.180
<v Speaker 4>he's Orthodox.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just doesn't know it yet.</v>

480
00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:02.830
<v Speaker 4>With this correlation has been </v>
<v Speaker 4>persistent.</v>

481
00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:05.043
<v Speaker 4>So what is this connection?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What made the connection between a </v>

482
00:28:09.041 --> 00:28:12.850
<v Speaker 4>traditional Christian like myself and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Dr. Peterson?</v>

483
00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:15.280
<v Speaker 4>So obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so immediate,</v>

484
00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:19.720
<v Speaker 4>and all of this I believes resolves </v>
<v Speaker 4>around the notion of logos.</v>

485
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.640
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

486
00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:26.360
<v Speaker 4>The language of logos is the underlying </v>
<v Speaker 4>language of Christianity.</v>

487
00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:28.860
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we know the,</v>

488
00:28:28.861 --> 00:28:29.281
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

489
00:28:29.281 --> 00:28:30.114
<v Speaker 4>the first vision of logos in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Christianity comes from the gospel of </v>

490
00:28:32.711 --> 00:28:36.010
<v Speaker 4>Saint John.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the beginning was the logos.</v>

491
00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:39.310
<v Speaker 4>The logos was with God and the logos was</v>
<v Speaker 4>God.</v>

492
00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:43.660
<v Speaker 4>He was in the beginning with God and </v>
<v Speaker 4>through him all things were made without</v>

493
00:28:43.661 --> 00:28:44.494
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing was made that has been made in </v>

494
00:28:47.291 --> 00:28:50.320
<v Speaker 4>him was life and that life was the light</v>
<v Speaker 4>of all mankind.</v>

495
00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:55.600
<v Speaker 4>The light shines in the darkness and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>darkness has not overcome it.</v>

496
00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.513
<v Speaker 4>And this vision of logos would be </v>
<v Speaker 4>continued and developed in the life of </v>

497
00:29:02.571 --> 00:29:07.571
<v Speaker 4>the church.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And especially in the seventh century.</v>

498
00:29:08.581 --> 00:29:10.620
<v Speaker 4>There was a saint,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his name is Saint Maximus,</v>

499
00:29:10.621 --> 00:29:11.454
<v Speaker 4>the confessor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he really brought this image of </v>

500
00:29:14.371 --> 00:29:19.371
<v Speaker 4>logos I would say to it's most detailed </v>
<v Speaker 4>or most elaborate vision.</v>

501
00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:23.503
<v Speaker 4>And he did so by taking uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the notion of logos that was in the new </v>

502
00:29:27.291 --> 00:29:28.124
<v Speaker 4>testament and he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he brought and united it with the best </v>

503
00:29:31.461 --> 00:29:33.950
<v Speaker 4>of what the western tradition had </v>
<v Speaker 4>already offered,</v>

504
00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:35.253
<v Speaker 4>who was able to prune,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say what had come from philosophy </v>

505
00:29:37.561 --> 00:29:40.850
<v Speaker 4>and and join it with what the Christian </v>
<v Speaker 4>message was.</v>

506
00:29:40.851 --> 00:29:44.590
<v Speaker 4>So it would attain some clarity and </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe some detail.</v>

507
00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:53.930
<v Speaker 4>And so saint maximus explains that all </v>
<v Speaker 4>things have a logos which are,</v>

508
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:56.183
<v Speaker 4>which is its reason for existence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>its purpose and its origin all at once </v>

509
00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:04.230
<v Speaker 4>and even its end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's all those things at once.</v>

510
00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:09.320
<v Speaker 4>And on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>each thing has a multitude of low g,</v>

511
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:11.360
<v Speaker 4>that's a word we would probably never </v>
<v Speaker 4>heard before.</v>

512
00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:14.840
<v Speaker 4>The is the plural of logos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the,</v>

513
00:30:14.841 --> 00:30:16.190
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the low being there,</v>

514
00:30:16.191 --> 00:30:17.024
<v Speaker 4>like the different qualities of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the blueness of the blue or the </v>

515
00:30:22.371 --> 00:30:27.371
<v Speaker 4>slowness of the slow and all of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>logies are brought together.</v>

516
00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:32.660
<v Speaker 4>They're woven together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we could say to sustain the existence of</v>

517
00:30:32.661 --> 00:30:33.494
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really a map of meaning to use </v>

518
00:30:37.911 --> 00:30:41.130
<v Speaker 4>Jordan's words.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now these logo,</v>

519
00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:43.940
<v Speaker 4>he's essences let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or things,</v>

520
00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:49.400
<v Speaker 4>they don't exist independently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the same way that scientists,</v>

521
00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:52.340
<v Speaker 4>they leave things exist out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

522
00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:53.263
<v Speaker 4>rather they exist as they come together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as they're joined together in our </v>

523
00:30:57.921 --> 00:31:00.800
<v Speaker 4>encounter with the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a pattern we could say,</v>

524
00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:04.080
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

525
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.510
<v Speaker 4>so we could say for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like had a sunset,</v>

526
00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:07.373
<v Speaker 4>has a certain amount of low view,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe even an indefinite amount of </v>

527
00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:13.523
<v Speaker 4>characteristics of a sunset.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But as they come together to be the </v>

528
00:31:18.121 --> 00:31:21.990
<v Speaker 4>experience of this sunset,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how we experience reality.</v>

529
00:31:21.991 --> 00:31:24.810
<v Speaker 4>That's how we come into contact with </v>
<v Speaker 4>reality.</v>

530
00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.370
<v Speaker 4>So all these qualities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a light color,</v>

531
00:31:33.371 --> 00:31:34.900
<v Speaker 4>vertical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>horizontal,</v>

532
00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:36.071
<v Speaker 4>and the things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

533
00:31:36.071 --> 00:31:37.480
<v Speaker 4>the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sky,</v>

534
00:31:37.481 --> 00:31:39.460
<v Speaker 4>the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of these things.</v>

535
00:31:39.461 --> 00:31:41.680
<v Speaker 4>And I could go on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an indefinite amount of them.</v>

536
00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:42.573
<v Speaker 4>What's important and making that </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience real is how all those logos </v>

537
00:31:45.761 --> 00:31:46.840
<v Speaker 4>are united.</v>

538
00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:50.743
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

539
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.880
<v Speaker 4>and in a way they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're united within us.</v>

540
00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:56.003
<v Speaker 4>And human beings for Saint Maximus are </v>
<v Speaker 4>seen as this laboratory where the whole </v>

541
00:32:00.331 --> 00:32:05.331
<v Speaker 4>world finds its cohesion and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>expresses it in the sense that the human</v>

542
00:32:06.061 --> 00:32:06.894
<v Speaker 4>being is a microcosm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you could say a condensation of the </v>

543
00:32:11.861 --> 00:32:12.694
<v Speaker 4>cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the place where the cosmos comes </v>

544
00:32:15.661 --> 00:32:20.661
<v Speaker 4>together to make sense</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a good way to see it is,</v>

545
00:32:20.871 --> 00:32:25.400
<v Speaker 4>is that human beings actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>participate being in the image of God,</v>

546
00:32:25.401 --> 00:32:29.600
<v Speaker 4>they participate in creation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We see that in the book of Genesis,</v>

547
00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:33.740
<v Speaker 4>the book of Genesis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God tells Adam to name the animals.</v>

548
00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:39.110
<v Speaker 4>And so by his logos participating in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>limited way,</v>

549
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:43.820
<v Speaker 4>in the same manner that the divine logos</v>
<v Speaker 4>was the source of everything.</v>

550
00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:53.760
<v Speaker 4>And the human participation in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>process is not a relativistic thing.</v>

551
00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:57.010
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not an individual thing.</v>

552
00:32:57.370 --> 00:32:58.203
<v Speaker 4>I mean though it is flexible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's nonetheless the most objective of </v>

553
00:33:00.611 --> 00:33:01.444
<v Speaker 4>processes as father Ted mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we need to be cautious though </v>

554
00:33:06.571 --> 00:33:11.571
<v Speaker 4>because Saint Maximus warns us that it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just a philosophy or it's not just a</v>

555
00:33:11.611 --> 00:33:13.530
<v Speaker 4>technical description of the world.</v>

556
00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:16.170
<v Speaker 5>MMM.</v>

557
00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:17.003
<v Speaker 4>This is important because thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 4>religious stories are exactly the same </v>

558
00:33:19.801 --> 00:33:20.634
<v Speaker 4>kind of encyclopedic knowledge of modern</v>
<v Speaker 4>science is the wrong way to go with </v>

559
00:33:25.561 --> 00:33:27.060
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These logos,</v>

560
00:33:27.061 --> 00:33:32.061
<v Speaker 4>these truth of most things are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or categories of our engagement with the</v>

561
00:33:32.551 --> 00:33:33.384
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So maybe today we might call them </v>

562
00:33:34.951 --> 00:33:37.680
<v Speaker 4>phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fifth phenomenological categories.</v>

563
00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.333
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

564
00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:42.570
<v Speaker 4>So the discovery of truth of logos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a personal journey.</v>

565
00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:44.723
<v Speaker 4>It's similar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tang is Lee or refinement of our </v>

566
00:33:46.471 --> 00:33:47.304
<v Speaker 4>understanding of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But at the same time he becomes a </v>

567
00:33:49.141 --> 00:33:54.141
<v Speaker 4>refinement of our person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So to discover the true nature of things</v>

568
00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:56.333
<v Speaker 4>is to walk on a path of truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So food is a wonderful thing and it's </v>

569
00:34:01.771 --> 00:34:02.604
<v Speaker 4>useful for life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But gluttony leads to our destruction </v>

570
00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:09.360
<v Speaker 4>well is useful to accomplish important </v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

571
00:34:09.361 --> 00:34:11.820
<v Speaker 4>but avarice Ross the soul.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you see,</v>

572
00:34:11.821 --> 00:34:13.530
<v Speaker 4>it's not just a description of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>

573
00:34:13.531 --> 00:34:16.740
<v Speaker 4>it's a path that we walk as we </v>
<v Speaker 4>discovered with world.</v>

574
00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:23.110
<v Speaker 4>And so sin in this vision of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that horrible world,</v>

575
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:25.700
<v Speaker 4>that horrible word that no one wants to </v>
<v Speaker 4>hear sin.</v>

576
00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:26.870
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>

577
00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:29.250
<v Speaker 4>Is it just the breaking of arbitrary </v>
<v Speaker 4>rules,</v>

578
00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:32.460
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's in the misuse of the world.</v>

579
00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:39.250
<v Speaker 4>And that misuse of the world ends up </v>
<v Speaker 4>being an untruth,</v>

580
00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:41.390
<v Speaker 4>ends up being a lie or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

581
00:34:41.391 --> 00:34:42.224
<v Speaker 4>or something that's false.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something that separates things from </v>

582
00:34:45.071 --> 00:34:45.904
<v Speaker 4>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's found when things are not aligned </v>

583
00:34:49.271 --> 00:34:52.510
<v Speaker 4>with their purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>

584
00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:54.070
<v Speaker 4>a person,</v>

585
00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:55.423
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

586
00:34:56.050 --> 00:34:56.883
<v Speaker 4>it's not only a tool for my own </v>
<v Speaker 4>gratification person is not just a tool </v>

587
00:35:02.171 --> 00:35:04.510
<v Speaker 4>so that it can advance myself in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

588
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:07.570
<v Speaker 4>And if I treat a person exclusively like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

589
00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:11.140
<v Speaker 4>then I will inevitably sin against that </v>
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>

590
00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:12.991
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>

591
00:35:12.991 --> 00:35:16.920
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't mean that a person cannot act</v>
<v Speaker 4>as it's cool for my gratification.</v>

592
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:20.730
<v Speaker 4>If I go see the baker and I get bread </v>
<v Speaker 4>from him,</v>

593
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:26.150
<v Speaker 4>he's the method by which I get my bread.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the baker is not just a baker.</v>

594
00:35:26.151 --> 00:35:29.330
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he is a full person just as myself.</v>

595
00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.440
<v Speaker 4>So when we steal or we lie or we cheat </v>
<v Speaker 4>if he,</v>

596
00:35:33.441 --> 00:35:34.274
<v Speaker 4>cause we're not considering that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>person facing us to be a full blown </v>

597
00:35:37.891 --> 00:35:38.724
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be what they are according to their </v>

598
00:35:40.801 --> 00:35:44.610
<v Speaker 4>logos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where we see them only as limited things</v>

599
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:45.840
<v Speaker 4>only as tools.</v>

600
00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:52.520
<v Speaker 4>So this is true of people of things and </v>
<v Speaker 4>of actions.</v>

601
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:54.463
<v Speaker 4>So I was thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to think about the best </v>

602
00:35:56.811 --> 00:36:00.220
<v Speaker 4>example that I could think of to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to show this in terms of action and,</v>

603
00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:01.730
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

604
00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:05.120
<v Speaker 4>I thought of giving the example of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of sex.</v>

605
00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:06.673
<v Speaker 4>So we did the metaphysics of peppa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I think we can get away with the </v>

606
00:36:09.051 --> 00:36:10.400
<v Speaker 4>metaphysics of sex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope.</v>

607
00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:13.633
<v Speaker 4>But it's a question that desperately </v>
<v Speaker 4>needs to be answered today in our topsy </v>

608
00:36:16.191 --> 00:36:17.450
<v Speaker 4>turvy times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>

609
00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.770
<v Speaker 4>So what is the logos of sexuality?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

610
00:36:21.771 --> 00:36:24.920
<v Speaker 4>it has many Loci,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many purposes.</v>

611
00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:31.800
<v Speaker 4>It's for the propagation of the species.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope at least a few of you still think</v>

612
00:36:31.941 --> 00:36:35.450
<v Speaker 4>that despite what many people would want</v>
<v Speaker 4>us to believe,</v>

613
00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:37.980
<v Speaker 5>it's</v>

614
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:38.813
<v Speaker 4>creates families and communities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It brings two people together and that </v>

615
00:36:43.321 --> 00:36:48.321
<v Speaker 4>type of communion in an expression of </v>
<v Speaker 4>love and it brings pleasure</v>

616
00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:52.080
<v Speaker 4>those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So those will be,</v>

617
00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:55.440
<v Speaker 4>would be some of the Lobi I'm sure we </v>
<v Speaker 4>could find more that some,</v>

618
00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:56.303
<v Speaker 4>those are the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the Loci that sex exists and </v>

619
00:36:59.041 --> 00:37:01.740
<v Speaker 4>there could be more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

620
00:37:01.741 --> 00:37:06.741
<v Speaker 4>idea in division of logos is that all </v>
<v Speaker 4>those things need to be brought together</v>

621
00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:11.340
<v Speaker 4>in a pattern of some sort for them to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>a path towards logos.</v>

622
00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:13.610
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

623
00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:18.080
<v Speaker 4>so if we think of the different logo and</v>
<v Speaker 4>we bring them together,</v>

624
00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.130
<v Speaker 4>trying to think of the word,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does that word when we,</v>

625
00:37:22.131 --> 00:37:22.964
<v Speaker 4>all those things are together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we have a word with a sacrament </v>

626
00:37:24.591 --> 00:37:27.890
<v Speaker 4>of the church.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll let you figure it out.</v>

627
00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.960
<v Speaker 4>What it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When all those things come together,</v>

628
00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:34.980
<v Speaker 4>and so each of the separate purposes of </v>
<v Speaker 4>sex that I mentioned,</v>

629
00:37:34.981 --> 00:37:37.080
<v Speaker 4>they're not wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're fine,</v>

630
00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:40.920
<v Speaker 4>but they do come alive when we bring </v>
<v Speaker 4>them together.</v>

631
00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:43.373
<v Speaker 4>If we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then each separate purpose appears as a </v>

632
00:37:46.171 --> 00:37:49.770
<v Speaker 4>kind of false hood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It appears as a kind of lacking.</v>

633
00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.353
<v Speaker 4>That's not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say for a truly traditional or a </v>

634
00:37:55.621 --> 00:37:59.940
<v Speaker 4>truly complete vision of sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it cannot end.</v>

635
00:37:59.941 --> 00:38:04.941
<v Speaker 4>There has to move towards he infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has to move towards God.</v>

636
00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:07.493
<v Speaker 4>And so the ultimate logos of sexuality </v>
<v Speaker 4>is to be an image of the mystical union </v>

637
00:38:12.091 --> 00:38:14.940
<v Speaker 4>with God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's to be an image of our union.</v>

638
00:38:14.941 --> 00:38:17.700
<v Speaker 4>With that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with what is beyond us.</v>

639
00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.353
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that image of the Mystical Union of </v>

640
00:38:25.571 --> 00:38:29.890
<v Speaker 4>God with the Soul,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with cross of Christ,</v>

641
00:38:29.891 --> 00:38:30.724
<v Speaker 4>with his church,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the marriage of heaven and earth is a </v>

642
00:38:33.761 --> 00:38:37.060
<v Speaker 4>completely traditional image we find in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the church.</v>

643
00:38:37.061 --> 00:38:38.740
<v Speaker 4>Fathers are in our tradition.</v>

644
00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:40.300
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

645
00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:43.330
<v Speaker 4>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that image of the ultimate union,</v>

646
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:46.270
<v Speaker 4>the highest union with the infinite,</v>

647
00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:47.780
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

648
00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:52.180
<v Speaker 4>then it comes back down into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>multiple lobe.</v>

649
00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:56.620
<v Speaker 4>All those other reasons for sexuality </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I mentioned and it feels dumb.</v>

650
00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:02.000
<v Speaker 4>It makes them participate in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>transcendent purpose and become the very</v>

651
00:39:02.001 --> 00:39:02.834
<v Speaker 4>relationship that binds them together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And everything in our life can follow </v>

652
00:39:06.861 --> 00:39:08.300
<v Speaker 4>that process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Work,</v>

653
00:39:08.301 --> 00:39:09.650
<v Speaker 4>food,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sleep,</v>

654
00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:10.723
<v Speaker 4>ut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And to engage the world in that frame </v>

655
00:39:16.011 --> 00:39:18.620
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is to find light everywhere.</v>

656
00:39:18.621 --> 00:39:23.621
<v Speaker 4>To see life everywhere the world is no </v>
<v Speaker 4>longer made of the dead,</v>

657
00:39:23.871 --> 00:39:25.250
<v Speaker 4>lifeless,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dirt,</v>

658
00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:27.840
<v Speaker 4>the dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lifeless material that you use to,</v>

659
00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:32.270
<v Speaker 4>to make things with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And as we become better as people,</v>

660
00:39:32.271 --> 00:39:34.040
<v Speaker 4>more truthful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more grateful,</v>

661
00:39:34.041 --> 00:39:39.041
<v Speaker 4>more free as he come closer to one </v>
<v Speaker 4>another in love.</v>

662
00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:40.641
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and by the way,</v>

663
00:39:40.641 --> 00:39:41.474
<v Speaker 4>that's what love is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Love is the manner in which all </v>

664
00:39:44.961 --> 00:39:47.570
<v Speaker 4>different things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all different people,</v>

665
00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:52.220
<v Speaker 4>all different intentions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can join together and exist in communion</v>

666
00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:57.340
<v Speaker 4>and can become one while at the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>time preserving the multiplicity.</v>

667
00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:06.420
<v Speaker 4>So as we follow this path,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hidden logo and creation,</v>

668
00:40:06.421 --> 00:40:07.254
<v Speaker 4>they shine through the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And today we might say that they </v>

669
00:40:10.621 --> 00:40:15.621
<v Speaker 4>re-enchantment the world and the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>appears bright and full and not the gray</v>

670
00:40:17.671 --> 00:40:19.740
<v Speaker 4>and dead shadows we often live in.</v>

671
00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:25.160
<v Speaker 4>So that would be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope,</v>

672
00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:27.080
<v Speaker 4>a summary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

673
00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:28.333
<v Speaker 4>of that path of logos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I haven't really explained what the </v>

674
00:40:31.871 --> 00:40:35.170
<v Speaker 4>source of my excitement was on that </v>
<v Speaker 4>Friday night yet.</v>

675
00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:36.753
<v Speaker 4>What the source of the excitement was </v>
<v Speaker 4>that has caused all this flurry of </v>

676
00:40:41.471 --> 00:40:42.304
<v Speaker 4>attention to Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I can tell you I didn't thinking </v>

677
00:40:46.541 --> 00:40:49.000
<v Speaker 4>about this now for months now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

678
00:40:49.001 --> 00:40:49.834
<v Speaker 4>some of us have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Jordan has been thinking about this </v>

679
00:40:51.701 --> 00:40:52.840
<v Speaker 4>for months now.</v>

680
00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:54.260
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

681
00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:55.093
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think by now we can say that it's </v>

682
00:40:56.541 --> 00:40:59.990
<v Speaker 4>really not about gender pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

683
00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.740
<v Speaker 4>it's about something that is a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>bigger than that.</v>

684
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:10.870
<v Speaker 4>And I think I can say confidently by now</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's about logos.</v>

685
00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:12.523
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

686
00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:13.593
<v Speaker 4>entire project or postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The last 30 40 years of higher culture </v>

687
00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:22.760
<v Speaker 4>and higher education has been a </v>
<v Speaker 4>systematic assault on logos.</v>

688
00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:24.100
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

689
00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:29.100
<v Speaker 4>To decenter logos to deconstruct </v>
<v Speaker 4>narratives and value hierarchies.</v>

690
00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:33.830
<v Speaker 4>So we are less slipping and sliding </v>
<v Speaker 4>without purpose and direction.</v>

691
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.230
<v Speaker 4>And now we've reached the end of what </v>
<v Speaker 4>postmodernism has to offer.</v>

692
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:41.783
<v Speaker 4>You can actually say we've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we've come to a point where </v>

693
00:41:43.471 --> 00:41:44.304
<v Speaker 4>postmodernism has one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Basically the cultural debate and a </v>

694
00:41:49.971 --> 00:41:50.804
<v Speaker 4>philosophy was decries the center and </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain certainty has pernicious Lee </v>

695
00:41:55.671 --> 00:42:00.340
<v Speaker 4>become the very center and </v>
<v Speaker 4>unquestionable authority despises.</v>

696
00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:04.100
<v Speaker 4>So everything is upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything is inside out.</v>

697
00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:09.610
<v Speaker 4>Everything is becoming its opposite and </v>
<v Speaker 4>all these inversions and chaos or not to</v>

698
00:42:10.071 --> 00:42:13.760
<v Speaker 4>be taken lightly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has brought about a sterile age,</v>

699
00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:14.683
<v Speaker 4>literally stare while as people are not </v>
<v Speaker 4>having enough children to to fill this </v>

700
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:21.623
<v Speaker 4>society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I keep thinking that maybe </v>

701
00:42:26.841 --> 00:42:28.420
<v Speaker 4>they're missing a bit of fall census.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

702
00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:36.773
<v Speaker 4>But it's also stair island that it has </v>
<v Speaker 4>brought about this narcissistic and </v>

703
00:42:41.281 --> 00:42:44.180
<v Speaker 4>fragmented culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see,</v>

704
00:42:44.181 --> 00:42:47.660
<v Speaker 4>they told us that the center cannot </v>
<v Speaker 4>hold.</v>

705
00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:48.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

706
00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:53.900
<v Speaker 4>And how things fall apart and now </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's decrying the end of truth.</v>

707
00:42:53.901 --> 00:42:54.890
<v Speaker 4>All of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

708
00:42:54.891 --> 00:42:58.550
<v Speaker 4>Everybody is saying that we're entering </v>
<v Speaker 4>an age of post truth fake news.</v>

709
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:59.623
<v Speaker 4>I mean my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even use it as an argument against Dr. </v>

710
00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:05.060
<v Speaker 4>Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the debate on gender pronouns.</v>

711
00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:06.813
<v Speaker 4>It's the postmodernist that heralded the</v>
<v Speaker 4>end of proof 40 years ago and now </v>

712
00:43:11.331 --> 00:43:13.460
<v Speaker 4>they're surprised to see the effect it </v>
<v Speaker 4>has.</v>

713
00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:18.940
<v Speaker 4>How chaos does not discriminate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How is turning against them?</v>

714
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:23.000
<v Speaker 4>Just as they turned it against their </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideological enemies,</v>

715
00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:25.243
<v Speaker 4>he wanted to change the world to sin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now they're surprised to find he's </v>

716
00:43:28.001 --> 00:43:33.001
<v Speaker 4>slipping between your fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is most surprising and what is most</v>

717
00:43:36.061 --> 00:43:40.890
<v Speaker 4>shocking to them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's defined that now having reached the</v>

718
00:43:40.891 --> 00:43:44.970
<v Speaker 4>end of their pursuit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having thought they had won.</v>

719
00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:50.420
<v Speaker 4>He see from within the decomposing </v>
<v Speaker 4>residues of western patriarchy,</v>

720
00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:56.500
<v Speaker 4>he see that there is a seed that </v>
<v Speaker 4>sprouting that in the darkest place,</v>

721
00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:02.000
<v Speaker 4>here's a flame that is lit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>logos or weekends.</v>

722
00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:07.130
<v Speaker 4>The darkness has not overcome it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Saint John promised this,</v>

723
00:44:07.131 --> 00:44:11.870
<v Speaker 4>that</v>
<v Speaker 4>my postmodern friends,</v>

724
00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:15.050
<v Speaker 4>if you had just paid attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>stories,</v>

725
00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:19.160
<v Speaker 4>if you just paid attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>stories which are woven in the fabric of</v>

726
00:44:19.161 --> 00:44:19.994
<v Speaker 4>our consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's very stories you tried to </v>

727
00:44:22.401 --> 00:44:23.234
<v Speaker 4>deconstruct,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would have noticed that don always </v>

728
00:44:24.801 --> 00:44:27.500
<v Speaker 4>comes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is seed is always planted.</v>

729
00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:32.860
<v Speaker 4>The logos regains the center,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christ raises from the dead.</v>

730
00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:36.193
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

731
00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:39.460
<v Speaker 4>and I think that's the excitement we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>feeling right now.</v>

732
00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:41.673
<v Speaker 4>The find that small sparks that seed of </v>
<v Speaker 4>a meaningful pattern surprising us in a </v>

733
00:44:47.801 --> 00:44:51.490
<v Speaker 4>collapsing world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's not just a pattern of meaning,</v>

734
00:44:51.491 --> 00:44:53.620
<v Speaker 4>but it's the beginning of a network of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

735
00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:54.513
<v Speaker 4>I mean just in the past two years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a whole new strange group of </v>

736
00:44:58.481 --> 00:45:00.900
<v Speaker 4>public figures that's arising from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>margins.</v>

737
00:45:00.901 --> 00:45:03.430
<v Speaker 4>People who are at least trying to figure</v>
<v Speaker 4>it out,</v>

738
00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:08.110
<v Speaker 4>who are at least trying to think clearly</v>
<v Speaker 4>and work out ideas and people who are as</v>

739
00:45:08.111 --> 00:45:08.944
<v Speaker 4>different from each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As you can imagine spending across </v>

740
00:45:11.591 --> 00:45:12.371
<v Speaker 4>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 4>race,</v>

741
00:45:12.371 --> 00:45:15.820
<v Speaker 4>and cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even religious and atheists alike trying</v>

742
00:45:15.821 --> 00:45:19.360
<v Speaker 4>to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And yet the media and the activists,</v>

743
00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:22.690
<v Speaker 4>they scream hysterically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bigot,</v>

744
00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:23.890
<v Speaker 4>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sexist,</v>

745
00:45:23.891 --> 00:45:24.724
<v Speaker 4>Nazi,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the usual litany of attacks and </v>

746
00:45:27.161 --> 00:45:32.020
<v Speaker 4>they're losing their minds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The sand is slipping out of their hand</v>

747
00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:34.383
<v Speaker 4>and it's only two years ago we would </v>
<v Speaker 4>have probably collapse before this </v>

748
00:45:37.691 --> 00:45:41.150
<v Speaker 4>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But now you look around and we find that</v>

749
00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:46.180
<v Speaker 4>there is a still silent center which to </v>
<v Speaker 4>sand in which to stand.</v>

750
00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:50.590
<v Speaker 4>There is an eye and the overwhelming </v>
<v Speaker 4>hurricane</v>

751
00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:57.200
<v Speaker 4>and we can finally say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we will not accept your frame.</v>

752
00:45:58.650 --> 00:45:59.483
<v Speaker 4>We will not accept your definitions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are weak by the very process you </v>

753
00:46:05.821 --> 00:46:09.810
<v Speaker 4>use to deconstruct them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to deconstruct the categories.</v>

754
00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:12.630
<v Speaker 4>And we will speak for ourselves</v>

755
00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:18.733
<v Speaker 4>what a relief.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it is a dangerous time to time of </v>

756
00:46:24.631 --> 00:46:27.210
<v Speaker 4>transition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A time of chaos is,</v>

757
00:46:27.211 --> 00:46:29.630
<v Speaker 4>it is a dangerous time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First he,</v>

758
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:30.583
<v Speaker 4>the enemies of logos will ramp up their </v>
<v Speaker 4>hysteria and totalitarian tendencies as </v>

759
00:46:36.241 --> 00:46:37.074
<v Speaker 4>logos awakens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it is also dangerous because that's </v>

760
00:46:41.341 --> 00:46:45.570
<v Speaker 4>Christ himself told us the terrors grow </v>
<v Speaker 4>amongst the week.</v>

761
00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:51.890
<v Speaker 4>The recentering of logos is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>reawakening of identities.</v>

762
00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:55.020
<v Speaker 4>He can't avoid that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a frightening thing.</v>

763
00:46:56.090 --> 00:47:01.090
<v Speaker 4>Cause if identity stops at the relative </v>
<v Speaker 4>low yogi without aiming,</v>

764
00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:05.370
<v Speaker 4>without uniting itself to the highest of</v>
<v Speaker 4>high,</v>

765
00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:07.260
<v Speaker 4>it can be murderous.</v>

766
00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:08.900
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

767
00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:13.010
<v Speaker 4>And it has been increasingly murderous </v>
<v Speaker 4>just in the past century.</v>

768
00:47:15.330 --> 00:47:20.330
<v Speaker 4>And it is in fact the very murderous and</v>
<v Speaker 4>genocidal tendency of identity,</v>

769
00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:24.270
<v Speaker 4>which provoked the postmoderns to </v>
<v Speaker 4>deconstruct identity in the first place.</v>

770
00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.510
<v Speaker 4>And there's a part where we can't blame </v>
<v Speaker 4>them for that.</v>

771
00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:31.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the shadow of Auschwitz,</v>

772
00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:32.390
<v Speaker 4>what else can you do?</v>

773
00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:36.520
<v Speaker 5>So what</v>

774
00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:43.620
<v Speaker 4>we'll strive from this new sprout hand </v>
<v Speaker 4>on us will depend on whole of us.</v>

775
00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:47.860
<v Speaker 4>What will rise from this chaos you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>seen excite me?</v>

776
00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:48.713
<v Speaker 4>Exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also frightening possibilities of </v>

777
00:47:50.521 --> 00:47:52.410
<v Speaker 4>what that might look like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

778
00:47:52.411 --> 00:47:56.940
<v Speaker 4>will it be race again so that we inch </v>
<v Speaker 4>towards genocide?</v>

779
00:47:56.941 --> 00:47:57.774
<v Speaker 4>Would it only be nation?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we're tempted to revisit the world </v>

780
00:48:01.081 --> 00:48:02.790
<v Speaker 4>wars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

781
00:48:02.791 --> 00:48:07.750
<v Speaker 4>they'd only be gender lid only be class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The schemes run out first.</v>

782
00:48:07.751 --> 00:48:09.990
<v Speaker 4>My Saint Maximus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ultimate identity,</v>

783
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:14.430
<v Speaker 4>the place where all meaning finds its </v>
<v Speaker 4>resolution is the divine logos,</v>

784
00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:18.330
<v Speaker 4>the source of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is our trajectory as we walk.</v>

785
00:48:18.331 --> 00:48:21.750
<v Speaker 4>The path of logo says we are transformed</v>
<v Speaker 4>by truth.</v>

786
00:48:21.810 --> 00:48:26.810
<v Speaker 4>The finality is to be united with God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I know that for some people just the</v>

787
00:48:28.481 --> 00:48:29.314
<v Speaker 4>word God causes allergic reactions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm sure people listening to this </v>

788
00:48:33.551 --> 00:48:37.180
<v Speaker 4>will be developing hives on their skin </v>
<v Speaker 4>as the cause they hear this.</v>

789
00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:40.270
<v Speaker 4>Then maybe we can just think of it this </v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

790
00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:42.183
<v Speaker 4>For identity to be more than a weapon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it must reach its highest point in </v>

791
00:48:47.081 --> 00:48:52.081
<v Speaker 4>something that is beyond who ally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so finding,</v>

792
00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:53.903
<v Speaker 4>seeing our highest identity in God is </v>
<v Speaker 4>finding unity with everything and the </v>

793
00:48:57.391 --> 00:48:58.290
<v Speaker 4>source of everything.</v>

794
00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:04.420
<v Speaker 4>And in terms of Christianity in </v>
<v Speaker 4>particular,</v>

795
00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:06.453
<v Speaker 4>the identity was Christ is different </v>
<v Speaker 4>from other identities because it's the </v>

796
00:49:09.281 --> 00:49:13.330
<v Speaker 4>identity with the cross and he needs to </v>
<v Speaker 4>identify with suffering.</v>

797
00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:15.103
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's not the identity of a self </v>
<v Speaker 4>serving power with the identity of a </v>

798
00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:22.180
<v Speaker 4>self emptying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>power of power,</v>

799
00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:26.650
<v Speaker 4>bound in low at empties itself out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>love.</v>

800
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:31.690
<v Speaker 4>I mean it doesn't mean that we shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>struggle.</v>

801
00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:33.890
<v Speaker 4>Does it mean that we should just lay </v>
<v Speaker 4>down and give up?</v>

802
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:34.743
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should let our enemies destroy what </v>

803
00:49:36.191 --> 00:49:38.800
<v Speaker 4>we value most and he cry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christ bought,</v>

804
00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:40.840
<v Speaker 4>brought a whip into the temple after </v>
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

805
00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:44.740
<v Speaker 4>But what it really entailed would it w </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's important about it,</v>

806
00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:45.993
<v Speaker 4>and this is something that is echoed </v>
<v Speaker 4>profoundly and with Dr. Peterson has </v>

807
00:49:49.721 --> 00:49:50.554
<v Speaker 4>been telling us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that we must first walk on the path </v>

808
00:49:52.671 --> 00:49:53.504
<v Speaker 4>that logos ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We must embrace our own suffering in </v>

809
00:49:58.001 --> 00:50:00.550
<v Speaker 4>that truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You must take up our cross.</v>

810
00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:08.100
<v Speaker 4>You must do so with a desire to first </v>
<v Speaker 4>get rid of the lies which to blind us.</v>

811
00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:13.190
<v Speaker 4>Just straighten our own path and in </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing so well that is how we will change</v>

812
00:50:13.981 --> 00:50:14.814
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Since Sarah Finn was sorrow is known to </v>

813
00:50:18.921 --> 00:50:23.570
<v Speaker 4>have said save yourself and thousands </v>
<v Speaker 4>around you will be saved.</v>

814
00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:28.100
<v Speaker 4>As we walk that path,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as</v>

815
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:32.210
<v Speaker 2>we strip away our own excesses rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>than look,</v>

816
00:50:32.211 --> 00:50:34.580
<v Speaker 2>rather than looking at the imbalances of</v>
<v Speaker 2>others,</v>

817
00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:39.050
<v Speaker 2>as we strip away our bad habits in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>narcissism,</v>

818
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:41.120
<v Speaker 2>rather than acting like victims,</v>

819
00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:44.513
<v Speaker 4>the rule change</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we will start to see and to </v>

820
00:50:49.391 --> 00:50:50.224
<v Speaker 4>experience logos to fully live within </v>
<v Speaker 4>the patterns of meeting that constitute </v>

821
00:50:54.401 --> 00:50:56.740
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you take that journey,</v>

822
00:50:56.741 --> 00:50:57.574
<v Speaker 4>I guarantee that the universal patterns </v>
<v Speaker 4>of meaning will manifest themselves so </v>

823
00:51:02.261 --> 00:51:05.170
<v Speaker 4>strongly in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

824
00:51:05.171 --> 00:51:07.480
<v Speaker 4>At first you'll use the word </v>
<v Speaker 4>synchronicity,</v>

825
00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:11.770
<v Speaker 4>but soon you will have no other word to </v>
<v Speaker 4>use besides here.</v>

826
00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:18.920
<v Speaker 4>And the postmodern chaos with vantage </v>
<v Speaker 4>has wax melts before the fire and logos,</v>

827
00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:21.663
<v Speaker 4>very logos that rises from the grave </v>
<v Speaker 4>will fill your world and the world with </v>

828
00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:29.570
<v Speaker 4>life and light.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

829
00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:35.240
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

830
00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:04.620
<v Speaker 6>so I'm going to start with a hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

831
00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:08.140
<v Speaker 6>I spend a lot of time thinking about,</v>

832
00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:13.510
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religious symbolism in archetypes,</v>

833
00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:15.543
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

834
00:52:15.550 --> 00:52:16.330
<v Speaker 2>there's a</v>

835
00:52:16.330 --> 00:52:17.163
<v Speaker 6>problem with that and the problem is</v>
<v Speaker 6>it lacks concretization notes to think </v>

836
00:52:26.201 --> 00:52:27.840
<v Speaker 6>about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The ultimate ideal is as,</v>

837
00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:33.060
<v Speaker 6>as only something that's symbolic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It moves away from the real world.</v>

838
00:52:33.321 --> 00:52:35.680
<v Speaker 6>And it's for partly for this reason</v>

839
00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:38.253
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

840
00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:42.760
<v Speaker 6>there's an insistence in Christianity </v>
<v Speaker 6>that the logo says two things at once.</v>

841
00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:43.713
<v Speaker 6>It took me a long time to figure this </v>
<v Speaker 6>out and I was guided in my attempts to </v>

842
00:52:47.801 --> 00:52:48.634
<v Speaker 6>understand it by Carl Young was truly </v>
<v Speaker 6>remarkable person and probably orthodox </v>

843
00:52:55.481 --> 00:52:57.580
<v Speaker 6>in his fundamental conviction.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I would say</v>

844
00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:04.420
<v Speaker 6>he talked about the logo says the thing </v>
<v Speaker 6>that existed at the beginning of time.</v>

845
00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:07.130
<v Speaker 6>This is a very particular way of looking</v>
<v Speaker 6>at things.</v>

846
00:53:07.131 --> 00:53:10.340
<v Speaker 6>And so the idea is essentially that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as Jonathan pointed out,</v>

847
00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:11.213
<v Speaker 6>that there's something about </v>
<v Speaker 6>consciousness that calls forth being </v>

848
00:53:15.081 --> 00:53:18.800
<v Speaker 6>from chaotic potential.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you won't understand what this means</v>

849
00:53:18.801 --> 00:53:21.420
<v Speaker 6>because when you look at the future,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or if you look at yourself,</v>

850
00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:24.200
<v Speaker 6>you know that what you confront is a </v>
<v Speaker 6>field of potential.</v>

851
00:53:24.350 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 6>And everyone tells you that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They</v>

852
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:28.740
<v Speaker 7>tell you you're not living up to your </v>
<v Speaker 7>potential.</v>

853
00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:31.950
<v Speaker 7>And potential is a very strange thing </v>
<v Speaker 7>because it doesn't.</v>

854
00:53:31.951 --> 00:53:32.784
<v Speaker 7>You have to exist.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so by the canons of the same modern </v>

855
00:53:34.801 --> 00:53:35.634
<v Speaker 7>science,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's not something that has any reality </v>

856
00:53:37.081 --> 00:53:37.914
<v Speaker 7>whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but everyone knows precisely what it </v>

857
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:40.343
<v Speaker 7>means.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And everything around it was full </v>

858
00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:42.423
<v Speaker 7>potential because you can interact with </v>
<v Speaker 7>it and bring forth new things and you </v>

859
00:53:46.351 --> 00:53:47.184
<v Speaker 7>know that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you can be called for your failure </v>

860
00:53:49.891 --> 00:53:50.840
<v Speaker 7>to do it and you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

861
00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:52.890
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you call,</v>

862
00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:57.150
<v Speaker 7>you call out yourself for your failure </v>
<v Speaker 7>to do it because you wake up at three in</v>

863
00:53:57.151 --> 00:53:57.984
<v Speaker 7>the morning and you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you torture yourself with your </v>

864
00:53:59.731 --> 00:54:02.810
<v Speaker 7>inability to bring forth the potential </v>
<v Speaker 7>that's within you and it,</v>

865
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:05.940
<v Speaker 7>and it haunts your soul.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it's hellish.</v>

866
00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:09.030
<v Speaker 7>And the reason it's hellish is because </v>
<v Speaker 7>it is hellish.</v>

867
00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:10.913
<v Speaker 7>And if you don't call forth the </v>
<v Speaker 7>potential that's within you and outside </v>

868
00:54:13.951 --> 00:54:16.080
<v Speaker 7>of you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then in the world does transform to hell</v>

869
00:54:16.081 --> 00:54:20.700
<v Speaker 7>because that's its tendency anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And we've had no shortage of evidence of</v>

870
00:54:20.701 --> 00:54:25.701
<v Speaker 7>that in the last 100 years.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

871
00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:30.950
<v Speaker 7>it's part of the Christian doctrine that</v>
<v Speaker 7>at the beginning of time,</v>

872
00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:35.010
<v Speaker 7>the logos of Yahuah</v>

873
00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:39.270
<v Speaker 7>operating on potential and brought forth</v>
<v Speaker 7>habitable,</v>

874
00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:40.413
<v Speaker 7>the habitable world or,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and it was perfect in some strange </v>

875
00:54:43.681 --> 00:54:44.514
<v Speaker 7>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was the paradise in which Adam and </v>

876
00:54:46.171 --> 00:54:48.900
<v Speaker 7>Eve were placed in the paradise was a </v>
<v Speaker 7>walled garden,</v>

877
00:54:48.901 --> 00:54:53.901
<v Speaker 7>a well watered place in the walled </v>
<v Speaker 7>garden is a place of order and chaos,</v>

878
00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:55.133
<v Speaker 7>culture and nature.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's because people inhabit a </v>

879
00:54:57.691 --> 00:54:59.370
<v Speaker 7>garden of culture,</v>
<v Speaker 7>nature,</v>

880
00:54:59.371 --> 00:55:01.110
<v Speaker 7>that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's our environment.</v>

881
00:55:01.170 --> 00:55:06.170
<v Speaker 7>And if those two properties are properly</v>
<v Speaker 7>balanced and inside that garden,</v>

882
00:55:06.631 --> 00:55:07.464
<v Speaker 7>everyone can flourish.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And human beings are principal made in </v>

883
00:55:13.881 --> 00:55:15.180
<v Speaker 7>the image of that logos.</v>

884
00:55:17.170 --> 00:55:19.090
<v Speaker 7>And that's why we can speak things into </v>
<v Speaker 7>B.</v>

885
00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:22.360
<v Speaker 7>And we do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And when you speak truth,</v>

886
00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:26.110
<v Speaker 7>then you speak paradise into being.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And when you speak falsely,</v>

887
00:55:26.111 --> 00:55:30.130
<v Speaker 7>you speak heroin being,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that's the truth.</v>

888
00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:34.630
<v Speaker 7>And what that means is that with every </v>
<v Speaker 7>decision that you make,</v>

889
00:55:35.590 --> 00:55:38.050
<v Speaker 7>you decide for yourself and for everyone</v>
<v Speaker 7>else,</v>

890
00:55:38.051 --> 00:55:41.650
<v Speaker 7>whether you're going to tilt the world a</v>
<v Speaker 7>little bit more towards hell or a little</v>

891
00:55:41.651 --> 00:55:42.484
<v Speaker 7>bit more towards heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's the burden that you bear for </v>

892
00:55:46.181 --> 00:55:50.650
<v Speaker 7>your existence and the choices that you </v>
<v Speaker 7>make as you pass through life.</v>

893
00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:51.513
<v Speaker 7>And it's the fleeing from that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's at the bottom of the nihilism of </v>

894
00:55:57.031 --> 00:55:57.864
<v Speaker 7>postmodernism and the escape into the </v>
<v Speaker 7>totalitarian certainties of idol </v>

895
00:56:03.691 --> 00:56:04.524
<v Speaker 7>worship.</v>

896
00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:06.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

897
00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:10.900
<v Speaker 7>And none of this is fictional because </v>
<v Speaker 7>we've seen the consequences.</v>

898
00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:15.523
<v Speaker 7>Jonathan said quoting,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't remember the source that there </v>

899
00:56:20.291 --> 00:56:25.291
<v Speaker 7>could be no poetry after,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that's wrong.</v>

900
00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:28.520
<v Speaker 7>But the poetry has to be about </v>
<v Speaker 7>Auschwitz.</v>

901
00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:31.620
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

902
00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:36.120
<v Speaker 7>The lesson for Marsh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which was never again and fair enough,</v>

903
00:56:36.121 --> 00:56:40.050
<v Speaker 7>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can't</v>

904
00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:45.020
<v Speaker 7>decide not to repeat something terrible </v>
<v Speaker 7>unless you understand it</v>

905
00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:49.410
<v Speaker 7>and way you don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is that</v>

906
00:56:52.090 --> 00:56:56.230
<v Speaker 7>the smallest things that each individual</v>
<v Speaker 7>culminate in a great sense of the state.</v>

907
00:56:57.190 --> 00:57:01.330
<v Speaker 7>And so when you ask why terrible things </v>
<v Speaker 7>happened in the world,</v>

908
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.823
<v Speaker 7>the answer's quite simple.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The answer is it's because you're not </v>

909
00:57:05.351 --> 00:57:06.184
<v Speaker 7>good enough</v>
<v Speaker 7>and it's because you don't tell the </v>

910
00:57:09.341 --> 00:57:12.010
<v Speaker 7>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>

911
00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:14.193
<v Speaker 7>John,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if it said something I thought was very </v>

912
00:57:15.191 --> 00:57:17.160
<v Speaker 7>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's something I've thought about,</v>

913
00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:19.090
<v Speaker 7>but I haven't talked to him about it at </v>
<v Speaker 7>all.</v>

914
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:26.050
<v Speaker 7>What happens as you move towards the </v>
<v Speaker 7>truth and the answer is everything comes</v>

915
00:57:26.051 --> 00:57:27.310
<v Speaker 7>together.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It really,</v>

916
00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:29.410
<v Speaker 7>really is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The answer is everything comes together.</v>

917
00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:31.930
<v Speaker 7>There's even a sexual element to that </v>
<v Speaker 7>because of course,</v>

918
00:57:31.931 --> 00:57:36.370
<v Speaker 7>the highest element of sexual ecstasy is</v>
<v Speaker 7>to come together</v>

919
00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:38.173
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

920
00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:42.010
<v Speaker 7>around someone who's telling the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everything comes together and that's the</v>

921
00:57:42.011 --> 00:57:43.420
<v Speaker 7>potential guests,</v>
<v Speaker 7>any of the world.</v>

922
00:57:43.421 --> 00:57:47.050
<v Speaker 7>It's something that you can partake in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's the calls,</v>

923
00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:50.050
<v Speaker 7>it's the call to the [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 7>greatest adventure that there is.</v>

924
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:51.543
<v Speaker 7>You can bring forth something akin to </v>
<v Speaker 7>paradise by speaking the truth and you </v>

925
00:57:55.271 --> 00:57:56.104
<v Speaker 7>can start in your own life and you can </v>
<v Speaker 7>start it in the life of your own </v>

926
00:57:59.141 --> 00:57:59.974
<v Speaker 7>families.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And these are people in principle that </v>

927
00:58:01.091 --> 00:58:01.924
<v Speaker 7>you love and so why would you do </v>
<v Speaker 7>anything but speak the truth to them to </v>

928
00:58:05.051 --> 00:58:05.884
<v Speaker 7>protect them from reality?</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's no protecting anyone from </v>

929
00:58:09.791 --> 00:58:12.550
<v Speaker 7>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Reality just is</v>

930
00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:20.150
<v Speaker 7>you interact with it on your,</v>
<v Speaker 7>on its terms and you do that my face and</v>

931
00:58:20.151 --> 00:58:25.151
<v Speaker 7>get forthright and you do that by not </v>
<v Speaker 7>shying away from the challenge.</v>

932
00:58:26.550 --> 00:58:29.370
<v Speaker 7>I spent a lot of time trying to </v>
<v Speaker 7>understand the sermon on the mount.</v>

933
00:58:31.110 --> 00:58:31.943
<v Speaker 7>It's a very strange document.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to tell you what I think it </v>

934
00:58:34.951 --> 00:58:35.784
<v Speaker 7>means.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It means conceptualize the highest good </v>

935
00:58:39.921 --> 00:58:40.754
<v Speaker 7>that you can</v>

936
00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:45.270
<v Speaker 7>and so you might think that would be the</v>
<v Speaker 7>highest good for you and it would be the</v>

937
00:58:45.271 --> 00:58:47.830
<v Speaker 7>highest good for the family around you </v>
<v Speaker 7>that you love.</v>

938
00:58:47.831 --> 00:58:48.664
<v Speaker 7>And it would be the highest good that </v>
<v Speaker 7>family in the state and it would be the </v>

939
00:58:51.391 --> 00:58:52.224
<v Speaker 7>highest good for the state.</v>
<v Speaker 7>In the world and that would be the </v>

940
00:58:54.031 --> 00:58:54.864
<v Speaker 7>highest possible.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Good a bit that even though you don't </v>

941
00:58:56.461 --> 00:58:59.430
<v Speaker 7>know how amy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that make that what you want</v>

942
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:02.263
<v Speaker 7>and then tell the truth and it's an </v>
<v Speaker 7>adventure because you don't know what's </v>

943
00:59:05.491 --> 00:59:07.650
<v Speaker 7>going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You have no idea.</v>

944
00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:09.490
<v Speaker 7>Because if you treat things </v>
<v Speaker 7>instrumental,</v>

945
00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:10.373
<v Speaker 7>you treat people instrumentally,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you use them as tools for your own </v>

946
00:59:12.541 --> 00:59:13.374
<v Speaker 7>desires and not.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The problem with that is what do you </v>

947
00:59:16.091 --> 00:59:16.924
<v Speaker 7>know about what you've designed?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Many things that you chased will turn </v>

948
00:59:20.011 --> 00:59:21.180
<v Speaker 7>out to be empty.</v>

949
00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:22.060
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

950
00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:23.980
<v Speaker 7>well what happens if you just tell the </v>
<v Speaker 7>truth?</v>

951
00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:27.330
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the world will unfold around you in very</v>

952
00:59:27.331 --> 00:59:31.110
<v Speaker 7>strange and mysterious ways and there </v>
<v Speaker 7>isn't anything gets more exciting to now</v>

953
00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:33.030
<v Speaker 7>and it's perhaps something excited me </v>
<v Speaker 7>enough.</v>

954
00:59:33.031 --> 00:59:37.770
<v Speaker 7>So that is suffering hits attendant on </v>
<v Speaker 7>being would redeem itself.</v>

955
00:59:37.830 --> 00:59:41.130
<v Speaker 7>Why not adventure?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's the call.</v>

956
00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:41.993
<v Speaker 7>That's the western call to the </v>
<v Speaker 7>individual is suffering of being can </v>

957
00:59:45.061 --> 00:59:47.850
<v Speaker 7>redeem itself through truth.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it's not,</v>

958
00:59:47.890 --> 00:59:49.980
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's not a rule.</v>

959
00:59:49.981 --> 00:59:54.390
<v Speaker 7>It's not a proposition that you need to </v>
<v Speaker 7>adhere to like a good citizen.</v>

960
00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:58.170
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's the proper way of when did your way</v>

961
00:59:58.171 --> 01:00:01.350
<v Speaker 7>through the terrible world without </v>
<v Speaker 7>making it worse than it already is,</v>

962
01:00:01.351 --> 01:00:04.290
<v Speaker 7>and with the possibility perhaps of </v>
<v Speaker 7>making it better.</v>

963
01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:09.800
<v Speaker 7>There's no more exciting possibility </v>
<v Speaker 7>than not and no higher moral demand.</v>

964
01:00:10.410 --> 01:00:13.230
<v Speaker 7>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is everyone knows that you know,</v>

965
01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:17.310
<v Speaker 7>when you lie according to your own </v>
<v Speaker 7>conception of the truth,</v>

966
01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.233
<v Speaker 7>that there's something something </v>
<v Speaker 7>shameful and demeaning about that and </v>

967
01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:23.910
<v Speaker 7>know that it hurts people and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

968
01:00:23.911 --> 01:00:26.490
<v Speaker 7>why do you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Despite all of that,</v>

969
01:00:26.491 --> 01:00:30.420
<v Speaker 7>in part because it's easy and partly </v>
<v Speaker 7>being,</v>

970
01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:32.910
<v Speaker 7>you do it because there's a crooked,</v>
<v Speaker 7>horrible,</v>

971
01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:33.773
<v Speaker 7>hellish part of your soul that's more </v>
<v Speaker 7>than happy if part of what you do is </v>

972
01:00:37.111 --> 01:00:40.800
<v Speaker 7>make everything worse to paid for the </v>
<v Speaker 7>sin of its existence.</v>

973
01:00:41.610 --> 01:00:44.860
<v Speaker 7>And I would say we should stop doing </v>
<v Speaker 7>that and see what we can do it,</v>

974
01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:49.500
<v Speaker 7>but got ourselves together as human </v>
<v Speaker 7>beings are remarkable creatures.</v>

975
01:00:50.430 --> 01:00:55.430
<v Speaker 7>We put together an amazing civilization </v>
<v Speaker 7>working out at half time.</v>

976
01:00:55.830 --> 01:00:59.070
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like 55% of humanity.</v>

977
01:00:59.620 --> 01:00:59.940
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

978
01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:00.773
<v Speaker 7>On a good day is working to make things </v>
<v Speaker 7>better and 45% is working to make it </v>

979
01:01:05.641 --> 01:01:06.474
<v Speaker 7>worse than you wonder what would happen </v>
<v Speaker 7>if we all just decided that we were </v>

980
01:01:10.021 --> 01:01:12.240
<v Speaker 7>going to make things better.</v>
<v Speaker 7>As simple as that.</v>

981
01:01:12.241 --> 01:01:15.300
<v Speaker 7>Start where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 7>make things around you better.</v>

982
01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:17.533
<v Speaker 7>Where would we be?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What would the world turned into around </v>

983
01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:25.190
<v Speaker 7>a civilization of people who were </v>
<v Speaker 7>genuinely trying to make things better?</v>

984
01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:26.593
<v Speaker 7>I can tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we better find out soon because if we </v>

985
01:01:28.131 --> 01:01:28.964
<v Speaker 7>don't try collectively to make things </v>
<v Speaker 7>better given the current state of </v>

986
01:01:32.061 --> 01:01:34.580
<v Speaker 7>affairs,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they are going to get a lot worse.</v>

987
01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.193
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

988
01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:39.873
<v Speaker 7>I thought for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I wonder why people find themselves </v>

989
01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:47.020
<v Speaker 7>adrift and meaninglessness and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 7>lot of answers to that.</v>

990
01:01:47.050 --> 01:01:51.700
<v Speaker 7>There's the classical criticisms of </v>
<v Speaker 7>traditional faith and being put forth by</v>

991
01:01:51.701 --> 01:01:53.670
<v Speaker 7>brilliant people like Friedrich </v>
<v Speaker 7>Nietzsche.</v>

992
01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:55.200
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

993
01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.033
<v Speaker 7>There's the idea that there were a fairy</v>
<v Speaker 7>tales that people live by prior to the </v>

994
01:02:00.361 --> 01:02:01.194
<v Speaker 7>modern age and revoke girl knows and </v>
<v Speaker 7>that's left this in a cosmo sticks </v>

995
01:02:03.781 --> 01:02:04.614
<v Speaker 7>bereft of meaning and so it's a </v>
<v Speaker 7>consequence of the inevitable unfolding </v>

996
01:02:08.311 --> 01:02:12.270
<v Speaker 7>of a kind of counting rationality.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And some of that's true,</v>

997
01:02:12.271 --> 01:02:13.104
<v Speaker 7>but there's a lot of it isn't true </v>
<v Speaker 7>because I've also come to understand </v>

998
01:02:17.581 --> 01:02:21.920
<v Speaker 7>that the reason that's many of us </v>
<v Speaker 7>proclaimed that life is meaningless this</v>

999
01:02:21.930 --> 01:02:22.763
<v Speaker 7>because we actually would rather have it</v>
<v Speaker 7>be meaning less than to take </v>

1000
01:02:25.501 --> 01:02:28.860
<v Speaker 7>responsibility for it because you can </v>
<v Speaker 7>imagine this,</v>

1001
01:02:28.861 --> 01:02:29.694
<v Speaker 7>you can imagine this scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Imagine you were offered a choice and </v>

1002
01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:35.460
<v Speaker 7>this is because you are offered this </v>
<v Speaker 7>choice.</v>

1003
01:02:35.461 --> 01:02:36.390
<v Speaker 7>If you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1004
01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:40.640
<v Speaker 7>absolutely nothing you do matters and </v>
<v Speaker 7>who the hell's going to know anyways?</v>

1005
01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:44.340
<v Speaker 7>Million years and so you can do whatever</v>
<v Speaker 7>you want moment to moment,</v>

1006
01:02:44.370 --> 01:02:44.640
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1007
01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:45.473
<v Speaker 7>That's the payoff for that perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 7>As you can do whatever you want moment </v>

1008
01:02:48.301 --> 01:02:52.140
<v Speaker 7>to moment and you will not be held </v>
<v Speaker 7>responsible by anyone including yourself</v>

1009
01:02:52.141 --> 01:02:55.520
<v Speaker 7>for pursuing your heading,</v>
<v Speaker 7>impulsive,</v>

1010
01:02:55.650 --> 01:02:57.390
<v Speaker 7>immoral,</v>
<v Speaker 7>foolish,</v>

1011
01:02:57.450 --> 01:02:58.283
<v Speaker 7>destructive genocidal tendencies or the </v>
<v Speaker 7>alternative is that you can assume that </v>

1012
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:04.583
<v Speaker 7>everything you do is meaningful and </v>
<v Speaker 7>everything you do has an impact on the </v>

1013
01:03:07.501 --> 01:03:08.334
<v Speaker 7>way the world unfolds and take </v>
<v Speaker 7>responsibility for that and it's </v>

1014
01:03:12.121 --> 01:03:15.060
<v Speaker 7>something that you'll have your meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All right?</v>

1015
01:03:15.061 --> 01:03:15.894
<v Speaker 7>That's for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because you have an infinite amount of </v>

1016
01:03:17.401 --> 01:03:18.234
<v Speaker 7>responsibility for every mistake that </v>
<v Speaker 7>you make under those circumstances and </v>

1017
01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:25.890
<v Speaker 7>perhaps as a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>as a medic come in for that,</v>

1018
01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:27.413
<v Speaker 7>the knowledge that when you're on the </v>
<v Speaker 7>path properly that you're helping you </v>

1019
01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:35.640
<v Speaker 7>world unfold and the best direction that</v>
<v Speaker 7>it possibly could.</v>

1020
01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.430
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there isn't anything better than that.</v>

1021
01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:42.360
<v Speaker 7>If you want something to set against the</v>
<v Speaker 7>inevitable suffering of,</v>

1022
01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:43.733
<v Speaker 7>of life,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's what you said against if eat </v>

1023
01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:47.453
<v Speaker 7>endless adventure of trying to make </v>
<v Speaker 7>things better in every possible way and </v>

1024
01:03:52.141 --> 01:03:57.141
<v Speaker 7>God only knows where we could get if we </v>
<v Speaker 7>did that around the perfect man,</v>

1025
01:03:57.930 --> 01:04:01.470
<v Speaker 7>everything comes together and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 7>believe that that's,</v>

1026
01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:02.393
<v Speaker 7>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's where the infinite logos that </v>

1027
01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:06.863
<v Speaker 7>express,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that stretches across time and space </v>

1028
01:04:08.821 --> 01:04:10.530
<v Speaker 7>comes together in a single individual.</v>

1029
01:04:10.530 --> 01:04:14.910
<v Speaker 7>That's the Christian story.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The reason for that is that every single</v>

1030
01:04:14.911 --> 01:04:18.810
<v Speaker 7>person is embedded in a specific time </v>
<v Speaker 7>and place.</v>

1031
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:21.390
<v Speaker 7>That's you as an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but at the same point,</v>

1032
01:04:21.570 --> 01:04:22.403
<v Speaker 7>you're also the involvement of this </v>
<v Speaker 7>thing that is active across forever to </v>

1033
01:04:26.521 --> 01:04:30.970
<v Speaker 7>call</v>
<v Speaker 7>chaos into habitable being.</v>

1034
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.330
<v Speaker 7>You're both his divine,</v>
<v Speaker 7>eternal,</v>

1035
01:04:34.331 --> 01:04:39.331
<v Speaker 7>transcendent essence and the finite </v>
<v Speaker 7>shell that you inhabit.</v>

1036
01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:45.490
<v Speaker 7>It's like the genie,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1037
01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:46.993
<v Speaker 7>A genie is genius and the genius is </v>
<v Speaker 7>something that can grant three magical </v>

1038
01:04:50.631 --> 01:04:51.464
<v Speaker 7>wishes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but how's to inhabit his tiny little </v>

1039
01:04:52.731 --> 01:04:54.980
<v Speaker 7>space?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's the same idea.</v>

1040
01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:56.473
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can act that out in your life and </v>

1041
01:04:59.151 --> 01:05:02.120
<v Speaker 7>you can transcend it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and as you do that,</v>

1042
01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:06.530
<v Speaker 7>things come together around you and </v>
<v Speaker 7>everything becomes musical.</v>

1043
01:05:06.531 --> 01:05:07.364
<v Speaker 7>That's the right way to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then everything becomes alive and </v>

1044
01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:11.353
<v Speaker 7>you shy away from that because you're </v>
<v Speaker 7>resentful about the fundamental </v>

1045
01:05:13.821 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 7>structure of being and you don't want </v>
<v Speaker 7>the responsibility and it's</v>

1046
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:22.180
<v Speaker 6>no bloody wonder because the </v>
<v Speaker 6>responsibility is the responsibility for</v>

1047
01:05:22.181 --> 01:05:23.200
<v Speaker 6>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

1048
01:05:23.201 --> 01:05:25.060
<v Speaker 6>That's why it's part of the Christian </v>
<v Speaker 6>story,</v>

1049
01:05:25.061 --> 01:05:26.680
<v Speaker 6>that Christ took the sins of the world</v>

1050
01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:27.653
<v Speaker 7>well themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because that's what you have to do in </v>

1051
01:05:29.361 --> 01:05:32.180
<v Speaker 7>order to put yourself together.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's your fault.</v>

1052
01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:38.300
<v Speaker 7>Everything isn't going right is because </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're not good enough.</v>

1053
01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:40.310
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who wants that?</v>

1054
01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:43.040
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Welcome.</v>

1055
01:05:43.041 --> 01:05:46.460
<v Speaker 7>The postmodernists has the lighten the </v>
<v Speaker 7>burden,</v>

1056
01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:48.890
<v Speaker 7>it consequences that nothing has any </v>
<v Speaker 7>meaning,</v>

1057
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:52.700
<v Speaker 7>but that's a small price to pay to get </v>
<v Speaker 7>rid of that particular burden.</v>

1058
01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:54.290
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>maybe not.</v>

1059
01:05:54.410 --> 01:05:59.410
<v Speaker 7>Maybe the meaning of life is to be found</v>
<v Speaker 7>in your voluntary willingness to take on</v>

1060
01:06:00.621 --> 01:06:02.840
<v Speaker 7>that burden and carry it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1061
01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:04.940
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's the notion that's embedded in the</v>

1062
01:06:04.941 --> 01:06:06.380
<v Speaker 7>idea of the cross,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1063
01:06:06.381 --> 01:06:11.381
<v Speaker 7>To pick up a full conscious knowledge of</v>
<v Speaker 7>your own vulnerability,</v>

1064
01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:15.290
<v Speaker 7>your,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your subjugation to be trail,</v>

1065
01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:16.660
<v Speaker 7>your tear,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your,</v>

1066
01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:18.103
<v Speaker 7>your slavery at the hands of the state,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your insanity and your mortality and to </v>

1067
01:06:22.611 --> 01:06:25.430
<v Speaker 7>say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'll bear that voluntarily.</v>

1068
01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:28.400
<v Speaker 7>It's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I can handle it.</v>

1069
01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:40.330
<v Speaker 6>It seems to me that we're at a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 6>crossroads.</v>

1070
01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:45.970
<v Speaker 6>I don't know exactly why you always meet</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Devil at the crossroads,</v>

1071
01:06:45.971 --> 01:06:48.880
<v Speaker 6>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the reason for that is because every</v>

1072
01:06:48.881 --> 01:06:51.460
<v Speaker 6>crossroads is a choice,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1073
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:53.590
<v Speaker 6>And it's always a choice between good </v>
<v Speaker 6>and evil.</v>

1074
01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:56.860
<v Speaker 6>We're at a crossroads and I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 6>why.</v>

1075
01:06:57.370 --> 01:06:58.203
<v Speaker 6>I guess it's because of the terrible </v>
<v Speaker 6>20th centuries and it's energy and now </v>

1076
01:07:01.001 --> 01:07:03.730
<v Speaker 6>we have something new.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In the aftermath of that,</v>

1077
01:07:03.970 --> 01:07:04.803
<v Speaker 6>it's time for everyone to pick up the </v>
<v Speaker 6>chaotic pieces and carry them </v>

1078
01:07:07.601 --> 01:07:08.434
<v Speaker 6>voluntarily and to make their way </v>
<v Speaker 6>through the world and to try to speak </v>

1079
01:07:11.501 --> 01:07:13.810
<v Speaker 6>their truth and to see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It will</v>

1080
01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:15.700
<v Speaker 7>eel yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1081
01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:17.990
<v Speaker 7>heal your body,</v>
<v Speaker 7>heal your soul,</v>

1082
01:07:18.050 --> 01:07:20.750
<v Speaker 7>heal your family.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It'll heal the nation.</v>

1083
01:07:20.930 --> 01:07:23.780
<v Speaker 7>That's what truth now is and how could </v>
<v Speaker 7>it be any other way?</v>

1084
01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:24.703
<v Speaker 7>The reality is the truth and how are you</v>
<v Speaker 7>going to adapt to it without using the </v>

1085
01:07:28.131 --> 01:07:29.870
<v Speaker 7>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 7>While the problem,</v>

1086
01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:30.763
<v Speaker 6>his reality is the terrible truth and </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's certainly possible that a terrible </v>

1087
01:07:33.651 --> 01:07:34.484
<v Speaker 6>truth is its own medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>With regards to my connections </v>

1088
01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:44.773
<v Speaker 6>orthodoxy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have kind of a funny story to tell </v>

1089
01:07:46.941 --> 01:07:49.110
<v Speaker 6>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1090
01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:53.760
<v Speaker 6>15 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a student of mine</v>

1091
01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:56.823
<v Speaker 6>who,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who I've maintained the relationship </v>

1092
01:07:58.351 --> 01:08:00.660
<v Speaker 6>with since I taught at Harvard.</v>

1093
01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:02.413
<v Speaker 5>MMM.</v>

1094
01:08:03.870 --> 01:08:06.030
<v Speaker 6>I'd helped him through a difficult </v>
<v Speaker 6>period.</v>

1095
01:08:06.031 --> 01:08:06.864
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his family had been at the center of a </v>

1096
01:08:09.151 --> 01:08:09.984
<v Speaker 6>real storm of publicity like this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a front page story for a number of </v>

1097
01:08:14.490 --> 01:08:15.860
<v Speaker 6>months.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Recently,</v>

1098
01:08:15.861 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 6>he</v>

1099
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:16.873
<v Speaker 7>returned the favor with me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he proposed at one point that I fly </v>

1100
01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:25.550
<v Speaker 7>down to Los Angeles and act as the </v>
<v Speaker 7>officiant at his marriage.</v>

1101
01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:27.230
<v Speaker 7>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's interesting.</v>

1102
01:08:27.231 --> 01:08:29.570
<v Speaker 7>I never expected that to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so I thought,</v>

1103
01:08:29.571 --> 01:08:30.590
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if I'm going to do that,</v>

1104
01:08:30.591 --> 01:08:34.610
<v Speaker 7>I better get ordained because that's </v>
<v Speaker 7>obviously the logical thing to do.</v>

1105
01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:35.630
<v Speaker 7>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1106
01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:39.570
<v Speaker 7>how do you get ordained on short notice?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And obviously the answer to that and see</v>

1107
01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:41.060
<v Speaker 7>you go online.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

1108
01:08:43.810 --> 01:08:46.500
<v Speaker 7>so I went online and I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I signed up,</v>

1109
01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:48.420
<v Speaker 7>I could name my church.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I did,</v>

1110
01:08:48.421 --> 01:08:50.430
<v Speaker 7>I have this church,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm the only member.</v>

1111
01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:52.193
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1112
01:08:54.730 --> 01:08:55.563
<v Speaker 7>it's called the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's called the Church of the spirit of </v>

1113
01:08:57.461 --> 01:09:00.220
<v Speaker 7>St your chem of florists,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which you know,</v>

1114
01:09:00.250 --> 01:09:02.830
<v Speaker 7>isn't necessarily the name that you </v>
<v Speaker 7>would expect.</v>

1115
01:09:03.370 --> 01:09:05.410
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I like to say Yo Kim,</v>

1116
01:09:05.411 --> 01:09:08.020
<v Speaker 7>from what I knew of him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because he had this idea that there were</v>

1117
01:09:08.021 --> 01:09:10.600
<v Speaker 7>three,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he paused.</v>

1118
01:09:10.610 --> 01:09:11.443
<v Speaker 7>There would be three parts of Western </v>
<v Speaker 7>civilization and one would be the epoch </v>

1119
01:09:13.950 --> 01:09:14.783
<v Speaker 7>of the father.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's what was like the Old </v>

1120
01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:20.760
<v Speaker 7>Testament and Old Testament reality that</v>
<v Speaker 7>has to do with following rules.</v>

1121
01:09:20.761 --> 01:09:21.594
<v Speaker 7>And then there was the park of the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that was of course the equal </v>

1122
01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:26.250
<v Speaker 7>Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he parking for the last 2000 years.</v>

1123
01:09:26.251 --> 01:09:27.084
<v Speaker 7>And he believed that what would come </v>
<v Speaker 7>after that would be the power of the </v>

1124
01:09:29.550 --> 01:09:31.080
<v Speaker 7>Holy Ghost.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And the Holy Ghost is this weird</v>

1125
01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:37.740
<v Speaker 7>spirit thing</v>
<v Speaker 7>hypothetic Christ's left behind in habit</v>

1126
01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:42.550
<v Speaker 7>people and guide them on their path.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it seems to me that that's very much</v>

1127
01:09:42.551 --> 01:09:45.130
<v Speaker 7>in keeping with the Orthodox idea that </v>
<v Speaker 7>the proper,</v>

1128
01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:46.393
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>moral pathway for each individual to </v>

1129
01:09:48.161 --> 01:09:51.670
<v Speaker 7>take is to attempt to bear the burden of</v>
<v Speaker 7>the perfect individual,</v>

1130
01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:53.530
<v Speaker 7>right to become Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so to speak,</v>

1131
01:09:53.531 --> 01:09:58.531
<v Speaker 7>in an attempt to transcend more calorie </v>
<v Speaker 7>infinitude into and to unite with God.</v>

1132
01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:00.071
<v Speaker 7>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1133
01:10:00.071 --> 01:10:02.680
<v Speaker 7>that was kind of a cool idea.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I thought,</v>

1134
01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:05.080
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I might as well have that as a church.</v>

1135
01:10:05.081 --> 01:10:07.720
<v Speaker 7>And then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who should I be in this church?</v>

1136
01:10:07.721 --> 01:10:08.554
<v Speaker 7>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1137
01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:13.060
<v Speaker 7>poke was probably a little bit on the </v>
<v Speaker 7>narcissistic side,</v>

1138
01:10:13.061 --> 01:10:16.160
<v Speaker 7>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I thought I'll be nips or Paula.</v>

1139
01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:17.893
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1140
01:10:17.970 --> 01:10:21.530
<v Speaker 7>Because I thought that was kind of </v>
<v Speaker 7>archaic and House and sort of out of the</v>

1141
01:10:21.531 --> 01:10:25.540
<v Speaker 7>way enough so that it was a good joke.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I'm my own metropolitan,</v>

1142
01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:28.130
<v Speaker 7>my own church.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It only has one rule.</v>

1143
01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:30.600
<v Speaker 7>And so you can show you it if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1144
01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:33.320
<v Speaker 7>the rule is that if you're a member of </v>
<v Speaker 7>my church,</v>

1145
01:10:33.321 --> 01:10:37.100
<v Speaker 7>you can't follow stupid rules.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1146
01:10:37.101 --> 01:10:38.750
<v Speaker 7>So that's a good rule because it's </v>
<v Speaker 7>actually,</v>

1147
01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:40.560
<v Speaker 7>it's an anti rule,</v>
<v Speaker 7>rule lay,</v>

1148
01:10:40.561 --> 01:10:42.290
<v Speaker 7>which is really funny as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 7>concerned.</v>

1149
01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:43.693
<v Speaker 7>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I went down to La and I did marry these </v>

1150
01:10:46.251 --> 01:10:48.080
<v Speaker 7>two and you're still married and so </v>
<v Speaker 7>that's good.</v>

1151
01:10:49.330 --> 01:10:50.870
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1152
01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:53.840
<v Speaker 7>So I know that's a good family,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's been a long day.</v>

1153
01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:56.900
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I talked to Sam Harris today.</v>

1154
01:10:56.901 --> 01:10:59.630
<v Speaker 7>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for those of you who it went great.</v>

1155
01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:05.300
<v Speaker 7>It went great.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Anyway,</v>

1156
01:11:05.301 --> 01:11:07.370
<v Speaker 7>so look,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the idea is pretty straightforward,</v>

1157
01:11:07.371 --> 01:11:08.204
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>as far as I can tell through this </v>

1158
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:10.183
<v Speaker 7>tremendous idea that's at the bottom of </v>
<v Speaker 7>western culture that's taken the human </v>

1159
01:11:13.441 --> 01:11:18.150
<v Speaker 7>race millennia and perhaps an endless </v>
<v Speaker 7>amount of time before then,</v>

1160
01:11:18.151 --> 01:11:20.710
<v Speaker 7>an eternal amount of time before then to</v>
<v Speaker 7>formulate.</v>

1161
01:11:21.150 --> 01:11:24.630
<v Speaker 7>The idea is that our consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that's the center of us,</v>

1162
01:11:24.631 --> 01:11:26.700
<v Speaker 7>the soul,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whatever that happens to be,</v>

1163
01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:31.680
<v Speaker 7>partakes in the process by which </v>
<v Speaker 7>creation comes into va.</v>

1164
01:11:31.710 --> 01:11:32.543
<v Speaker 7>And we do that through the logos,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is our capacity to think and to </v>

1165
01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:37.583
<v Speaker 7>other words and to engage in dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But more importantly to do that </v>

1166
01:11:40.201 --> 01:11:43.650
<v Speaker 7>truthfully and to the degree that we're </v>
<v Speaker 7>able to do that truthfully,</v>

1167
01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.800
<v Speaker 7>we bring paradise into being rather than</v>
<v Speaker 7>hell.</v>

1168
01:11:46.801 --> 01:11:51.801
<v Speaker 7>And it seems to me that that's as close </v>
<v Speaker 7>to objective reality,</v>

1169
01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:55.320
<v Speaker 7>although it's not precisely objective,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's more than objective reality to kind</v>

1170
01:11:55.321 --> 01:11:56.380
<v Speaker 7>of Metta reality.</v>

1171
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:58.770
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's the most profound truth that you'll</v>

1172
01:11:58.771 --> 01:11:59.604
<v Speaker 7>ever encounter.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And the thing that's cool about it is </v>

1173
01:12:01.861 --> 01:12:04.230
<v Speaker 7>you can even,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can put it to the test if you want,</v>

1174
01:12:04.231 --> 01:12:06.930
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you start deciding that you're not going</v>

1175
01:12:06.931 --> 01:12:09.240
<v Speaker 7>to lie because how the hell are you </v>
<v Speaker 7>going to tell the truth?</v>

1176
01:12:09.241 --> 01:12:10.710
<v Speaker 7>What do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't know what the truth is,</v>

1177
01:12:10.711 --> 01:12:14.400
<v Speaker 7>but you certainly know when you're lying</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you know how to stop doing that.</v>

1178
01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:15.630
<v Speaker 7>So I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well just try,</v>

1179
01:12:15.631 --> 01:12:18.690
<v Speaker 7>stop lying and see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Try it for like a year.</v>

1180
01:12:18.990 --> 01:12:20.730
<v Speaker 7>You don't get to lie about anything </v>
<v Speaker 7>anymore.</v>

1181
01:12:20.910 --> 01:12:21.743
<v Speaker 7>And that also means you can't do things </v>
<v Speaker 7>that you would be afraid to talk about </v>

1182
01:12:24.421 --> 01:12:27.060
<v Speaker 7>because you know if you're going to tell</v>
<v Speaker 7>the truth,</v>

1183
01:12:27.061 --> 01:12:28.680
<v Speaker 7>you have to tell the truth about what </v>
<v Speaker 7>you did.</v>

1184
01:12:28.681 --> 01:12:29.514
<v Speaker 7>And if you do reprehensible things,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then you can't just run around telling </v>

1185
01:12:31.741 --> 01:12:32.670
<v Speaker 7>everybody about them.</v>

1186
01:12:32.850 --> 01:12:33.683
<v Speaker 7>So it also means that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if not act in a way that you wouldn't </v>

1187
01:12:36.241 --> 01:12:39.960
<v Speaker 7>speak truthfully about and try it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You'll find out first of all,</v>

1188
01:12:39.961 --> 01:12:40.794
<v Speaker 7>that you're so full of lies and deceit </v>
<v Speaker 7>that you just bloody wall can't believe </v>

1189
01:12:43.411 --> 01:12:46.560
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When I started doing this 30 years ago,</v>

1190
01:12:46.650 --> 01:12:47.483
<v Speaker 7>it really just about drove me crazy </v>
<v Speaker 7>because I divided into two people in </v>

1191
01:12:50.671 --> 01:12:51.504
<v Speaker 7>some sense and one person,</v>
<v Speaker 7>one person was talking and the other </v>

1192
01:12:55.681 --> 01:12:56.514
<v Speaker 7>person was watching,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the person that was talking in the </v>

1193
01:12:58.681 --> 01:13:03.090
<v Speaker 7>talking person was a puppet and the </v>
<v Speaker 7>watching person was the right person.</v>

1194
01:13:03.091 --> 01:13:05.650
<v Speaker 7>And every time the talking person said </v>
<v Speaker 7>something to watching,</v>

1195
01:13:05.651 --> 01:13:08.160
<v Speaker 7>first person could go eop elite that </v>
<v Speaker 7>that isn't true,</v>

1196
01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:10.320
<v Speaker 7>that isn't here idea.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I thought,</v>

1197
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:11.303
<v Speaker 7>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's really not good because it looks </v>

1198
01:13:12.451 --> 01:13:13.284
<v Speaker 7>like 95% of what I'm saying isn't mine.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Or I'm saying it for show or I'm saying </v>

1199
01:13:16.891 --> 01:13:19.950
<v Speaker 7>it can be dominant primate or unsaying </v>
<v Speaker 7>it so that I can be,</v>

1200
01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:21.173
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so that I can use my language </v>

1201
01:13:23.461 --> 01:13:26.040
<v Speaker 7>instrumentally and get what I want or,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or you know,</v>

1202
01:13:26.041 --> 01:13:28.380
<v Speaker 7>I swiped it from the book and I really </v>
<v Speaker 7>don't deserve it.</v>

1203
01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:32.760
<v Speaker 7>But I'm saying it like it was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was 95% seriously.</v>

1204
01:13:32.761 --> 01:13:33.594
<v Speaker 7>And so then I learned at least in part </v>
<v Speaker 7>to only say things that made me feel </v>

1205
01:13:37.141 --> 01:13:37.974
<v Speaker 7>like I was together.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's a part of that coming </v>

1206
01:13:39.391 --> 01:13:41.100
<v Speaker 7>together.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can feel that physically,</v>

1207
01:13:41.101 --> 01:13:41.934
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you,</v>

1208
01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:45.600
<v Speaker 7>if you say something deceitful,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you shrink and you cower from it,</v>

1209
01:13:45.601 --> 01:13:47.820
<v Speaker 7>it makes you embarrassed and it makes </v>
<v Speaker 7>you weak.</v>

1210
01:13:47.821 --> 01:13:50.030
<v Speaker 7>You can feel the weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So like,</v>

1211
01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.960
<v Speaker 7>well stop saying things that make you </v>
<v Speaker 7>weak.</v>

1212
01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:54.330
<v Speaker 7>If you don't want to be me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then if you want to be strong,</v>

1213
01:13:54.331 --> 01:13:56.250
<v Speaker 7>stop saying things that make you feel </v>
<v Speaker 7>weak.</v>

1214
01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.230
<v Speaker 7>Try it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Try it.</v>

1215
01:13:58.231 --> 01:13:59.064
<v Speaker 7>See what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can test this out and here are </v>

1216
01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:02.970
<v Speaker 7>things will be way different for you in </v>
<v Speaker 7>five years.</v>

1217
01:14:02.971 --> 01:14:03.804
<v Speaker 7>You won't even be the same person and </v>
<v Speaker 7>God only knows what will happen in the </v>

1218
01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:08.000
<v Speaker 7>decades.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it's really worth it.</v>

1219
01:14:08.010 --> 01:14:09.780
<v Speaker 7>We started,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you don't have an embedded to do anyways</v>

1220
01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:11.350
<v Speaker 7>because here you are,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1221
01:14:11.351 --> 01:14:12.184
<v Speaker 7>suffering stupidly away,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you might as well do something useful </v>

1222
01:14:14.441 --> 01:14:16.660
<v Speaker 7>with your time while you're waiting to </v>
<v Speaker 7>die.</v>

1223
01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:20.120
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there isn't anything</v>

1224
01:14:20.130 --> 01:14:21.990
<v Speaker 7>I think more interesting to do than </v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

1225
01:14:21.991 --> 01:14:25.380
<v Speaker 7>It's so cool because don't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's part of what I decided to do</v>

1226
01:14:25.470 --> 01:14:27.320
<v Speaker 7>last September when I made these,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1227
01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:28.343
<v Speaker 7>crazy videos,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which really have more of a necessity </v>

1228
01:14:30.270 --> 01:14:32.220
<v Speaker 7>and I certainly thought they would.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I thought,</v>

1229
01:14:32.221 --> 01:14:33.054
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've got some things to say and why </v>

1230
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:37.500
<v Speaker 7>don't I say them and see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's sort of,</v>

1231
01:14:37.830 --> 01:14:38.663
<v Speaker 7>that's an excellent way to live.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why don't I say the things that I think </v>

1232
01:14:40.741 --> 01:14:44.730
<v Speaker 7>and see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1233
01:14:44.731 --> 01:14:46.230
<v Speaker 7>this is one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 7>happened.</v>

1234
01:14:46.231 --> 01:14:47.430
<v Speaker 7>So that's kind of cool.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1235
01:14:47.431 --> 01:14:50.430
<v Speaker 7>how long likely is this?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's completely absurd and ridiculous.</v>

1236
01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:52.080
<v Speaker 7>Here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm with Jonathan,</v>

1237
01:14:52.081 --> 01:14:55.710
<v Speaker 7>this crazy French Canadian carver and </v>
<v Speaker 7>these two guys in dresses here on you.</v>

1238
01:14:58.130 --> 01:14:58.963
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what you'd expect given </v>

1239
01:15:00.981 --> 01:15:02.740
<v Speaker 2>what I've been talking about recently</v>

1240
01:15:05.130 --> 01:15:05.963
<v Speaker 7>because it's very unlikely.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And all of this is being very unlikely </v>

1241
01:15:07.981 --> 01:15:09.990
<v Speaker 7>and life is very unlikely.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>

1242
01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:12.460
<v Speaker 7>maybe it could be absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 7>magnificent,</v>

1243
01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:13.413
<v Speaker 7>wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We could make everything into a holy </v>

1244
01:15:15.031 --> 01:15:15.864
<v Speaker 7>temple in which we did live forever,</v>
<v Speaker 7>peacefully only searching for more </v>

1245
01:15:19.651 --> 01:15:22.500
<v Speaker 7>remarkable and spectacular things to do </v>
<v Speaker 7>next.</v>

1246
01:15:22.501 --> 01:15:23.334
<v Speaker 7>And that's what people do with parents.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They sit around dreaming about how the </v>

1247
01:15:26.701 --> 01:15:27.534
<v Speaker 7>paradise they already had could give </v>
<v Speaker 7>rise to a paradise that's yet greater </v>

1248
01:15:31.621 --> 01:15:35.040
<v Speaker 7>than the one that's there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And with the collective imagination that</v>

1249
01:15:35.041 --> 01:15:37.110
<v Speaker 7>we pursued,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that could be a never ending thing.</v>

1250
01:15:37.111 --> 01:15:39.630
<v Speaker 7>And we could bring it into being.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's what we should do.</v>

1251
01:15:39.631 --> 01:15:40.464
<v Speaker 7>Because the alternative is to let </v>
<v Speaker 7>everything degenerate into chaos and </v>

1252
01:15:43.130 --> 01:15:45.870
<v Speaker 7>hale.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And how about we don't do that?</v>

1253
01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:48.150
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's good enough.</v>

1254
01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:53.810
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1267
01:16:35.771 --> 01:16:36.604
<v Speaker 1>after Father Jeffrey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his uncle will have the question and </v>

1268
01:16:37.511 --> 01:16:39.010
<v Speaker 1>answer period and if you have more</v>

1269
01:16:39.130 --> 01:16:42.340
<v Speaker 7>questions after that we'll collect those</v>
<v Speaker 7>as well just</v>

1270
01:16:43.650 --> 01:16:46.110
<v Speaker 1>and if you're on the balcony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just give them to Aden.</v>

1271
01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the different,</v>

1272
01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:54.300
<v Speaker 2>good evening.</v>

1273
01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:56.890
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the Ted and I have had a,</v>

1274
01:16:56.940 --> 01:16:57.773
<v Speaker 7>an a running debates over the last few </v>
<v Speaker 7>weeks as to what would be worse going </v>

1275
01:17:01.751 --> 01:17:06.751
<v Speaker 7>first or going laughs,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how do I follow that?</v>

1276
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:11.623
<v Speaker 8>The second century church did something </v>
<v Speaker 8>rather strange and quite astonishing </v>

1277
01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:17.593
<v Speaker 8>stories about Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which had been circulating orally for </v>

1278
01:17:21.170 --> 01:17:22.003
<v Speaker 8>some generations,</v>
<v Speaker 8>began to be written down in the second </v>

1279
01:17:24.531 --> 01:17:29.531
<v Speaker 8>half of the first century who are </v>
<v Speaker 8>numerous versions in circulation,</v>

1280
01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:34.250
<v Speaker 8>which came over time to be associated </v>
<v Speaker 8>with the traditions of one or another.</v>

1281
01:17:34.251 --> 01:17:37.100
<v Speaker 8>Epistolic witness to the risen Lord </v>
<v Speaker 8>Jesus.</v>

1282
01:17:38.690 --> 01:17:41.220
<v Speaker 8>And at a certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a choice had to be made.</v>

1283
01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:45.510
<v Speaker 8>The church could have come up with a </v>
<v Speaker 8>definitive accounts,</v>

1284
01:17:46.050 --> 01:17:50.260
<v Speaker 8>the single canonical version.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And that approach was,</v>

1285
01:17:50.261 --> 01:17:51.094
<v Speaker 8>was certainly a temptation.</v>
<v Speaker 8>One of the first to do this was a </v>

1286
01:17:53.911 --> 01:17:58.770
<v Speaker 8>dualistic heretic called Marcy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He settled on one Gospel,</v>

1287
01:17:59.250 --> 01:18:02.350
<v Speaker 8>the gospel of Luke as it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You liked that,</v>

1288
01:18:02.351 --> 01:18:03.900
<v Speaker 8>huh?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Which he redacted.</v>

1289
01:18:03.930 --> 01:18:05.130
<v Speaker 8>However,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the suit,</v>

1290
01:18:05.131 --> 01:18:07.590
<v Speaker 8>his vision,</v>
<v Speaker 8>incidentally,</v>

1291
01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:08.453
<v Speaker 8>he also rejected the entire Old </v>
<v Speaker 8>Testament and the process teaching that </v>

1292
01:18:11.101 --> 01:18:11.934
<v Speaker 8>matter was evil and therefore the </v>
<v Speaker 8>creator God of the Old Testament was </v>

1293
01:18:14.701 --> 01:18:15.534
<v Speaker 8>responsible for it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But the point here is that he wanted a </v>

1294
01:18:18.871 --> 01:18:21.060
<v Speaker 8>single goal,</v>
<v Speaker 8>spoke to reflect Jesus,</v>

1295
01:18:21.061 --> 01:18:26.061
<v Speaker 8>who he saw as offering salvation from </v>
<v Speaker 8>this material world that was a harrison.</v>

1296
01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:30.150
<v Speaker 8>This thing,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this idea of a single gospel continue to</v>

1297
01:18:30.151 --> 01:18:30.984
<v Speaker 8>be a temptation even for those within </v>
<v Speaker 8>the canonical church in the middle of </v>

1298
01:18:35.251 --> 01:18:36.084
<v Speaker 8>the second century and otherwise quite </v>
<v Speaker 8>orthodox believer rotation apparently </v>

1299
01:18:39.751 --> 01:18:42.810
<v Speaker 8>scandalized by the plurality of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>gospels,</v>

1300
01:18:43.140 --> 01:18:45.020
<v Speaker 8>created his famous via Tesoro.</v>

1301
01:18:46.170 --> 01:18:47.003
<v Speaker 8>In this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he wove the gospel accounts into one </v>

1302
01:18:49.231 --> 01:18:52.950
<v Speaker 8>seamless consistent narrative and it had</v>
<v Speaker 8>some traction.</v>

1303
01:18:52.951 --> 01:18:53.784
<v Speaker 8>In fact for some centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 8>particularly among the Syria a </v>

1304
01:18:56.730 --> 01:18:59.240
<v Speaker 8>tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This was the main gospel use,</v>

1305
01:19:00.010 --> 01:19:00.843
<v Speaker 8>but the church rejected both of these </v>
<v Speaker 8>attempts and from the beginning of the </v>

1306
01:19:06.031 --> 01:19:08.820
<v Speaker 8>process of the canonization of the New </v>
<v Speaker 8>Testament,</v>

1307
01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:13.770
<v Speaker 8>it accepted that there should be </v>
<v Speaker 8>different gospels leading the charge was</v>

1308
01:19:13.771 --> 01:19:14.604
<v Speaker 8>the second century bishop of Neil </v>
<v Speaker 8>[inaudible] who insisted or what he </v>

1309
01:19:18.421 --> 01:19:19.254
<v Speaker 8>called the oven Galyon Techco Morpho the</v>
<v Speaker 8>four fold gospel already in his days </v>

1310
01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:26.903
<v Speaker 8>day.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Those were the four gospels we have in </v>

1311
01:19:27.751 --> 01:19:31.270
<v Speaker 8>our new test and today</v>
<v Speaker 8>this is important,</v>

1312
01:19:31.271 --> 01:19:35.050
<v Speaker 8>fully aware of the significant </v>
<v Speaker 8>differences in the accounts,</v>

1313
01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:38.830
<v Speaker 8>not only different emphases and </v>
<v Speaker 8>theological visions,</v>

1314
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:44.030
<v Speaker 8>the contradictions the church chose to </v>
<v Speaker 8>canonize diversity.</v>

1315
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:46.343
<v Speaker 8>It shows to retain for separate and </v>
<v Speaker 8>distinctive literary compositions </v>

1316
01:19:49.381 --> 01:19:52.980
<v Speaker 8>witnessing to the life,</v>
<v Speaker 8>death and resurrection of Jesus.</v>

1317
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:54.943
<v Speaker 8>This is interesting for all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 8>reasons and of course it points to the </v>

1318
01:19:57.801 --> 01:19:58.634
<v Speaker 8>experience of Jesus being more profound </v>
<v Speaker 8>than any one account with capture but </v>

1319
01:20:03.051 --> 01:20:05.890
<v Speaker 8>not least.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And for our purposes and theme tonight,</v>

1320
01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:10.380
<v Speaker 8>it also says something about the meaning</v>
<v Speaker 8>of what it is to be human.</v>

1321
01:20:12.190 --> 01:20:13.023
<v Speaker 8>As a new testament scholar,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Luke Timothy Johnson drives the </v>

1322
01:20:16.421 --> 01:20:17.254
<v Speaker 8>diversity of the Gospel.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Accounts signifies the infinite </v>

1323
01:20:20.830 --> 01:20:25.830
<v Speaker 8>recommended replicability of the story </v>
<v Speaker 8>of Jesus in the lives of human beings.</v>

1324
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.610
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1325
01:20:27.610 --> 01:20:28.443
<v Speaker 8>The story of Jesus is not simply a pass.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The church declares it continues as the </v>

1326
01:20:33.221 --> 01:20:34.054
<v Speaker 8>spirit of Jesus transforms the lives of </v>
<v Speaker 8>human beings according to the mind of </v>

1327
01:20:38.171 --> 01:20:43.040
<v Speaker 8>Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but in what sense can the story of Jesus</v>

1328
01:20:43.041 --> 01:20:43.874
<v Speaker 8>be replicated?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Surely not in the specifics of his </v>

1329
01:20:47.481 --> 01:20:50.660
<v Speaker 8>ministry,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which are irretrievably in the past.</v>

1330
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:52.183
<v Speaker 8>It's not about being a celibate,</v>
<v Speaker 8>bearded Jewish male growing up in </v>

1331
01:20:54.861 --> 01:20:58.040
<v Speaker 8>gallery in the first century Palestine </v>
<v Speaker 8>technology.</v>

1332
01:20:58.250 --> 01:21:00.630
<v Speaker 8>Someone who works with his hands like </v>
<v Speaker 8>it's awesome.</v>

1333
01:21:00.670 --> 01:21:01.503
<v Speaker 8>Father.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Such historical elements are not </v>

1334
01:21:03.621 --> 01:21:06.560
<v Speaker 8>repeatable.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Neither are they important to the piece,</v>

1335
01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:08.973
<v Speaker 8>rather the plurality of the gospels in </v>
<v Speaker 8>their variety of and contradictory </v>

1336
01:21:13.570 --> 01:21:15.680
<v Speaker 8>historical details.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

1337
01:21:15.690 --> 01:21:18.400
<v Speaker 8>it's beyond all this to a deeper </v>
<v Speaker 8>significance.</v>

1338
01:21:19.450 --> 01:21:23.000
<v Speaker 8>That is to the meaning of the story of </v>
<v Speaker 8>Jesus contained in these.</v>

1339
01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:24.993
<v Speaker 8>It's not the facts of Jesus's life that </v>
<v Speaker 8>matter and find new expression in the </v>

1340
01:21:28.151 --> 01:21:33.100
<v Speaker 8>lives of others,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but rather a pattern of his existence.</v>

1341
01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:35.263
<v Speaker 8>Jesus' existence as one of radical </v>
<v Speaker 8>obedience towards God and selfless </v>

1342
01:21:39.581 --> 01:21:40.414
<v Speaker 8>service towards others forms a pattern </v>
<v Speaker 8>for all humanity that can be written in </v>

1343
01:21:44.981 --> 01:21:46.570
<v Speaker 8>the heart by the Holy Spirit.</v>

1344
01:21:48.850 --> 01:21:53.140
<v Speaker 8>It's this pattern that Paul designates </v>
<v Speaker 8>as the normals.</v>

1345
01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:56.350
<v Speaker 8>History often translated the law of </v>
<v Speaker 8>Christ,</v>

1346
01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:59.830
<v Speaker 8>but it's better understood perhaps as </v>
<v Speaker 8>the pattern of Christ,</v>

1347
01:21:59.831 --> 01:22:04.240
<v Speaker 8>the pattern of the Messiah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>As an aside,</v>

1348
01:22:04.450 --> 01:22:05.283
<v Speaker 8>his concept of the pattern of Christ </v>
<v Speaker 8>etched into the multiform narratives </v>

1349
01:22:08.531 --> 01:22:11.380
<v Speaker 8>that witness to the life,</v>
<v Speaker 8>death and resurrection of Jesus.</v>

1350
01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:12.333
<v Speaker 8>It was also the reason for the limits </v>
<v Speaker 8>that were placed on what could be </v>

1351
01:22:14.921 --> 01:22:17.170
<v Speaker 8>considered gospel.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You see,</v>

1352
01:22:17.171 --> 01:22:18.004
<v Speaker 8>a diversity was not just allowed but a </v>
<v Speaker 8>requirement to express the fullness of </v>

1353
01:22:21.761 --> 01:22:25.750
<v Speaker 8>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was nevertheless a bridge too far and</v>

1354
01:22:25.751 --> 01:22:26.584
<v Speaker 8>the rejection of the so-called gnostic </v>
<v Speaker 8>gospels with which I'm sure many of you </v>

1355
01:22:29.951 --> 01:22:32.620
<v Speaker 8>are familiar,</v>
<v Speaker 8>was precisely that.</v>

1356
01:22:32.621 --> 01:22:33.454
<v Speaker 8>They were not narratives but often just </v>
<v Speaker 8>collections of safe and that makes </v>

1357
01:22:38.621 --> 01:22:39.454
<v Speaker 8>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The gnostics were not interested in the </v>

1358
01:22:41.021 --> 01:22:41.854
<v Speaker 8>material world,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and to have a story requires </v>

1359
01:22:44.471 --> 01:22:45.304
<v Speaker 8>materiality.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There sacred texts as much as they </v>

1360
01:22:48.461 --> 01:22:49.294
<v Speaker 8>purported to be about Jesus lacks </v>
<v Speaker 8>precisely the narrative element of the </v>

1361
01:22:53.261 --> 01:22:55.000
<v Speaker 8>passion of Christ.</v>

1362
01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:56.673
<v Speaker 8>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 8>time does not suffice for us to explore </v>

1363
01:22:57.881 --> 01:22:58.714
<v Speaker 8>together this evening.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How across all the various writings of </v>

1364
01:23:00.851 --> 01:23:04.720
<v Speaker 8>the New Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this underlying pattern of price,</v>

1365
01:23:04.770 --> 01:23:05.603
<v Speaker 8>the or maybe each outline,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the very brief list of sketches in the </v>

1366
01:23:09.311 --> 01:23:12.850
<v Speaker 8>four gospels and the letters of Paul and</v>
<v Speaker 8>the other early apostles.</v>

1367
01:23:12.851 --> 01:23:13.684
<v Speaker 8>Behind all the collected facts,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's a deep consistency and the </v>

1368
01:23:18.130 --> 01:23:18.963
<v Speaker 8>earliest Christian literature concerning</v>
<v Speaker 8>a focus not on wondrous deeds or even </v>

1369
01:23:23.230 --> 01:23:24.063
<v Speaker 8>wise words or on the character of Jesus </v>
<v Speaker 8>as Messiah on the meaning of his life </v>

1370
01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:30.453
<v Speaker 8>and death.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They all reveal the same pattern of </v>

1371
01:23:34.091 --> 01:23:38.080
<v Speaker 8>radical obedience to God and selfless </v>
<v Speaker 8>love towards other people.</v>

1372
01:23:38.590 --> 01:23:39.423
<v Speaker 8>They reveal a journey that plunges to </v>
<v Speaker 8>the depths of alienation in solidarity </v>

1373
01:23:44.231 --> 01:23:47.500
<v Speaker 8>with all and then rises in </v>
<v Speaker 8>glorification,</v>

1374
01:23:47.650 --> 01:23:51.160
<v Speaker 8>having not nearly overcome suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 8>sin and death,</v>

1375
01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:52.353
<v Speaker 8>but empty of their power.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They reveal a pattern of joyful </v>

1376
01:23:57.131 --> 01:23:59.590
<v Speaker 8>sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 8>voluntary death,</v>

1377
01:23:59.950 --> 01:24:01.570
<v Speaker 8>and glorious resurrection.</v>

1378
01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:06.910
<v Speaker 8>And they also all agree on this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that discipleship is the follow the same</v>

1379
01:24:06.911 --> 01:24:07.744
<v Speaker 8>messianic pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They don't emphasize that followers of </v>

1380
01:24:10.631 --> 01:24:14.860
<v Speaker 8>Jesus performs certain deeds or learn </v>
<v Speaker 8>certain doctrines.</v>

1381
01:24:15.310 --> 01:24:16.143
<v Speaker 8>They insist rather on living according </v>
<v Speaker 8>to the same pattern of life and death </v>

1382
01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:25.270
<v Speaker 8>shown by Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 8>To be a Christian therefore is not about</v>

1383
01:24:25.271 --> 01:24:27.910
<v Speaker 8>dogma.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We've been morality,</v>

1384
01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:30.850
<v Speaker 8>although there are dogmatic and ethical </v>
<v Speaker 8>implications.</v>

1385
01:24:31.330 --> 01:24:33.850
<v Speaker 8>It's not about all that religious </v>
<v Speaker 8>baggage.</v>

1386
01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:37.480
<v Speaker 8>We so often associated with it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It is to live.</v>

1387
01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:43.440
<v Speaker 8>It is for each of us to enact in our </v>
<v Speaker 8>unique human existence.</v>

1388
01:24:43.810 --> 01:24:47.980
<v Speaker 8>The numinous is to a pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Now,</v>

1389
01:24:47.981 --> 01:24:50.800
<v Speaker 8>there are numerous ways we can describe </v>
<v Speaker 8>this pattern of prize.</v>

1390
01:24:51.610 --> 01:24:52.443
<v Speaker 8>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the eastern fathers principal mode of </v>

1391
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:57.810
<v Speaker 8>exegesis of understanding scripture is </v>
<v Speaker 8>tychology,</v>

1392
01:24:58.770 --> 01:25:01.030
<v Speaker 8>so we can add to pattern the word </v>
<v Speaker 8>pattern.</v>

1393
01:25:01.031 --> 01:25:02.860
<v Speaker 8>Another word,</v>
<v Speaker 8>depots or type.</v>

1394
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:08.390
<v Speaker 8>A type is a person and object or an </v>
<v Speaker 8>event that is connected across space,</v>

1395
01:25:08.391 --> 01:25:09.490
<v Speaker 8>time to others.</v>

1396
01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:13.390
<v Speaker 8>Without losing its own historical </v>
<v Speaker 8>reality and identity,</v>

1397
01:25:13.630 --> 01:25:17.080
<v Speaker 8>it shares in a greater reality of </v>
<v Speaker 8>meaning,</v>

1398
01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:21.640
<v Speaker 8>that greater reality,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which it points a greater reality called</v>

1399
01:25:21.641 --> 01:25:22.474
<v Speaker 8>the anteater.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is how the apostles and the church </v>

1400
01:25:25.481 --> 01:25:28.510
<v Speaker 8>fathers read the entire Old Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 8>For example,</v>

1401
01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:32.800
<v Speaker 8>Adam Saint Paul says,</v>
<v Speaker 8>is a t posts a type of Christ,</v>

1402
01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:33.933
<v Speaker 8>the first created man pointing forward </v>
<v Speaker 8>to the recreation of the human rights </v>

1403
01:25:36.970 --> 01:25:37.803
<v Speaker 8>race in price Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The exodus narrative as an event is a </v>

1404
01:25:42.311 --> 01:25:45.530
<v Speaker 8>type of a true Passover or Pascal </v>
<v Speaker 8>Christ,</v>

1405
01:25:45.531 --> 01:25:49.750
<v Speaker 8>deliverance of old people from suffering</v>
<v Speaker 8>and death in anyone is familiar with the</v>

1406
01:25:49.751 --> 01:25:50.584
<v Speaker 8>writings of the church.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Fathers are of the liturgy of the </v>

1407
01:25:52.301 --> 01:25:56.480
<v Speaker 8>Orthodox church who know how abundant </v>
<v Speaker 8>types are within them.</v>

1408
01:25:57.320 --> 01:25:58.153
<v Speaker 8>But this is the key.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Topology is not just a way of reading </v>

1409
01:26:01.601 --> 01:26:06.601
<v Speaker 8>and understanding history in seeing how </v>
<v Speaker 8>people and Events Point towards Christ.</v>

1410
01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:09.013
<v Speaker 8>Topology is for eastern fathers the </v>
<v Speaker 8>fundamental structure of reality of a </v>

1411
01:26:14.031 --> 01:26:16.200
<v Speaker 8>world that is symbolic of an,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1412
01:26:16.350 --> 01:26:21.350
<v Speaker 8>an epiphany or theophany of God and of </v>
<v Speaker 8>our own apprehension of this reality,</v>

1413
01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:24.740
<v Speaker 8>our own finding of meaning within it.</v>

1414
01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:29.840
<v Speaker 8>So it's not just figures from scriptural</v>
<v Speaker 8>history that are types,</v>

1415
01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:35.200
<v Speaker 8>we too are cold to typify Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 8>to be symbols of Christ.</v>

1416
01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:40.690
<v Speaker 8>Participants in his archetypal journey </v>
<v Speaker 8>and life is dissent in self offering.</v>

1417
01:26:41.810 --> 01:26:46.280
<v Speaker 8>And he's a scent you Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If we are to be truly human,</v>

1418
01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.480
<v Speaker 8>we must follow what distinguished </v>
<v Speaker 8>scholar of this university.</v>

1419
01:26:50.481 --> 01:26:54.800
<v Speaker 8>Northrop Frye calls the u shaped story.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That is the foundation,</v>

1420
01:26:54.801 --> 01:26:58.220
<v Speaker 8>not only a biblical narrative and the </v>
<v Speaker 8>Christ story,</v>

1421
01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:03.880
<v Speaker 8>but a story after story,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Myth after myth in Christ,</v>

1422
01:27:05.150 --> 01:27:10.150
<v Speaker 8>the archetype of archetypes we have in </v>
<v Speaker 8>the words of Cs Lewis myth become fact.</v>

1423
01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:16.820
<v Speaker 8>As we've already heard this evening in </v>
<v Speaker 8>the gospel of Saint John,</v>

1424
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:20.960
<v Speaker 8>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this pattern is above all called logos.</v>

1425
01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:22.573
<v Speaker 8>It's not an abstract pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's a direct and in these latter </v>

1426
01:27:26.090 --> 01:27:31.090
<v Speaker 8>days in the fullness of time had direct </v>
<v Speaker 8>incarnate expression of God himself.</v>

1427
01:27:32.150 --> 01:27:35.660
<v Speaker 8>The logos is the principle of order and </v>
<v Speaker 8>creation as we've heard.</v>

1428
01:27:35.930 --> 01:27:40.250
<v Speaker 8>It's through the logos that God speaks </v>
<v Speaker 8>and all things are made.</v>

1429
01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:43.760
<v Speaker 8>It is logos,</v>
<v Speaker 8>God's verb,</v>

1430
01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:44.653
<v Speaker 8>perhaps better than word verb in whose </v>
<v Speaker 8>image we are creators whose likeness we </v>

1431
01:27:49.641 --> 01:27:50.474
<v Speaker 8>are called to attain.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And the lesson here is simply this that </v>

1432
01:27:54.291 --> 01:27:55.124
<v Speaker 8>are properly ordered.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Human life is one lived in accordance </v>

1433
01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:00.193
<v Speaker 8>with the locals.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The concept of logos has a long and </v>

1434
01:28:03.561 --> 01:28:04.394
<v Speaker 8>venerable history and it did even before</v>
<v Speaker 8>the Greek translators of the Old </v>

1435
01:28:07.820 --> 01:28:08.653
<v Speaker 8>Testament and the new testament writers </v>
<v Speaker 8>appropriated it and one of the first </v>

1436
01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:13.393
<v Speaker 8>hour,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the first of the Greek philosophers to </v>

1437
01:28:14.391 --> 01:28:15.224
<v Speaker 8>speak of logos was the pre socratic </v>
<v Speaker 8>hereclitis and he said this to low bu </v>

1438
01:28:20.510 --> 01:28:24.290
<v Speaker 8>the end.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Those seniors who seen equally,</v>

1439
01:28:24.590 --> 01:28:29.590
<v Speaker 8>although logos is common to all all have</v>
<v Speaker 8>the locals,</v>

1440
01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:34.010
<v Speaker 8>the many live as if they had a wisdom of</v>
<v Speaker 8>their own.</v>

1441
01:28:35.780 --> 01:28:40.220
<v Speaker 8>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 8>lobos may govern the University of Macro</v>

1442
01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:43.760
<v Speaker 8>Cosmos and our own inner world,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the Amico Osmoles,</v>

1443
01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:47.240
<v Speaker 8>but most people don't choose a properly </v>
<v Speaker 8>ordered life,</v>

1444
01:28:47.241 --> 01:28:48.074
<v Speaker 8>a life aligned with the compass built </v>
<v Speaker 8>into the fabric of the world built into </v>

1445
01:28:51.381 --> 01:28:53.180
<v Speaker 8>their own hearts and minds.</v>

1446
01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:57.890
<v Speaker 8>We've heard already,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we are now in the season of Great Lens.</v>

1447
01:28:57.950 --> 01:29:02.130
<v Speaker 8>The great 40 days is at school and this </v>
<v Speaker 8>has significances.</v>

1448
01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:04.800
<v Speaker 8>It's a season of course,</v>
<v Speaker 8>have a set of labor of renewal.</v>

1449
01:29:04.801 --> 01:29:08.520
<v Speaker 8>If faith redoubling of our commitment to</v>
<v Speaker 8>prayer and the service of others.</v>

1450
01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:11.840
<v Speaker 8>It's also the season and preparing </v>
<v Speaker 8>catechumens apap</v>

1451
01:29:13.410 --> 01:29:14.243
<v Speaker 8>above over.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's the season where we're called to </v>

1452
01:29:16.381 --> 01:29:20.520
<v Speaker 8>come to our sense and to awake to the </v>
<v Speaker 8>fundamental meaning,</v>

1453
01:29:20.521 --> 01:29:25.080
<v Speaker 8>shape and pattern of our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We realize our alienation.</v>

1454
01:29:25.650 --> 01:29:30.650
<v Speaker 8>We repent with Tanya,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we embark on our journey of return,</v>

1455
01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:32.093
<v Speaker 8>a journey which involves self sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a journey which necessarily passes </v>

1456
01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:40.770
<v Speaker 8>through our own voluntary death and </v>
<v Speaker 8>resurrection.</v>

1457
01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:45.270
<v Speaker 8>Lent is in essence the totality of our </v>
<v Speaker 8>life,</v>

1458
01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:48.400
<v Speaker 8>but it requires the remembrance of </v>
<v Speaker 8>death.</v>

1459
01:29:49.710 --> 01:29:54.710
<v Speaker 8>It was a famous practice in ancient Rome</v>
<v Speaker 8>as a general came back victorious from a</v>

1460
01:29:54.931 --> 01:29:55.764
<v Speaker 8>battle and during his triumphant parade </v>
<v Speaker 8>receive compliments and honors from the </v>

1461
01:30:00.511 --> 01:30:01.680
<v Speaker 8>crowd of citizens.</v>

1462
01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:06.690
<v Speaker 8>He ran the risk of falling victim to his</v>
<v Speaker 8>own pride and delusions of grand jury.</v>

1463
01:30:06.691 --> 01:30:10.050
<v Speaker 8>And to avoid that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a slave would be placed just behind him,</v>

1464
01:30:10.051 --> 01:30:12.180
<v Speaker 8>whispering into his ear saying,</v>
<v Speaker 8>hey,</v>

1465
01:30:12.181 --> 01:30:14.660
<v Speaker 8>speech a post post-stay onm team </v>
<v Speaker 8>momentum.</v>

1466
01:30:14.661 --> 01:30:18.510
<v Speaker 8>We'll look after you to the time of your</v>
<v Speaker 8>death and remember,</v>

1467
01:30:18.630 --> 01:30:19.463
<v Speaker 8>you're only a man thereafter.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was enshrined and picked up in </v>

1468
01:30:22.741 --> 01:30:26.910
<v Speaker 8>Christian tradition as Memento Mori.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Remember that you will die,</v>

1469
01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:33.470
<v Speaker 8>but better yet remember to</v>
<v Speaker 8>remember to write and think we need that</v>

1470
01:30:36.151 --> 01:30:36.984
<v Speaker 8>remembers,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but maybe because eventually all of us </v>

1471
01:30:39.541 --> 01:30:40.374
<v Speaker 8>will probably improve equal to the task </v>
<v Speaker 8>but remember to die because remember to </v>

1472
01:30:45.721 --> 01:30:46.554
<v Speaker 8>find and follow the logos,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the pattern of our true life which </v>

1473
01:30:49.771 --> 01:30:50.604
<v Speaker 8>passes through death to resurrection,</v>
<v Speaker 8>very frequent theme and patristic </v>

1474
01:30:55.621 --> 01:30:56.760
<v Speaker 8>tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Saint Gregory,</v>

1475
01:30:56.761 --> 01:31:01.761
<v Speaker 8>the theologian often repeats the saying </v>
<v Speaker 8>of Plato which suggests that the present</v>

1476
01:31:01.801 --> 01:31:02.634
<v Speaker 8>life or to be a meditation on death and </v>
<v Speaker 8>he advised his friend for luxurious to </v>

1477
01:31:07.711 --> 01:31:08.544
<v Speaker 8>live instead of the present the future </v>
<v Speaker 8>and make this life a meditation and </v>

1478
01:31:11.971 --> 01:31:14.790
<v Speaker 8>practice of death and could go on from </v>
<v Speaker 8>the church fathers,</v>

1479
01:31:15.010 --> 01:31:15.843
<v Speaker 8>the focus on death is front and center </v>
<v Speaker 8>remembrance of our journey that passes </v>

1480
01:31:21.721 --> 01:31:23.190
<v Speaker 8>from death to life.</v>

1481
01:31:23.190 --> 01:31:27.120
<v Speaker 8>This is also the connection of lent with</v>
<v Speaker 8>a preparation for baptism.</v>

1482
01:31:27.810 --> 01:31:28.643
<v Speaker 8>Baptism in its deepest in primary sense </v>
<v Speaker 8>signifies death and burial and </v>

1483
01:31:33.751 --> 01:31:37.170
<v Speaker 8>resurrection with Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is very clear in Romans chapter six</v>

1484
01:31:37.290 --> 01:31:40.020
<v Speaker 8>the epistle which we read on the eve of </v>
<v Speaker 8>Easter,</v>

1485
01:31:40.021 --> 01:31:43.230
<v Speaker 8>Costco,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we have been baptized into Christ death.</v>

1486
01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:46.830
<v Speaker 8>We have been buried with him by baptism </v>
<v Speaker 8>into death.</v>

1487
01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:47.753
<v Speaker 8>We have been united to Christ in a death</v>
<v Speaker 8>like his and united to him and as a </v>

1488
01:31:51.870 --> 01:31:56.870
<v Speaker 8>resurrection like his.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So baptism means death and resurrection.</v>

1489
01:31:57.001 --> 01:32:02.001
<v Speaker 8>Saint Gregory of Nissa says the is both </v>
<v Speaker 8>to and mother</v>

1490
01:32:04.140 --> 01:32:04.973
<v Speaker 8>you Orthodox theologian Paul Ever hemos </v>
<v Speaker 8>writes about this is the extended </v>

1491
01:32:09.991 --> 01:32:13.190
<v Speaker 8>quotation if you're there with me and </v>
<v Speaker 8>just him,</v>

1492
01:32:13.220 --> 01:32:14.053
<v Speaker 8>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 8>means sharing mystically in Christ's </v>

1493
01:32:15.571 --> 01:32:16.404
<v Speaker 8>death and his burial,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but also in what happened between his </v>

1494
01:32:21.331 --> 01:32:24.730
<v Speaker 8>burial and his resurrection,</v>
<v Speaker 8>his descent.</v>

1495
01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:28.410
<v Speaker 8>He's a hell.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What is the meaning of the incarnation?</v>

1496
01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:29.513
<v Speaker 8>God becoming truly human in Christ </v>
<v Speaker 8>identifies himself with all human </v>

1497
01:32:33.601 --> 01:32:35.610
<v Speaker 8>anguish,</v>
<v Speaker 8>alienation,</v>

1498
01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:39.060
<v Speaker 8>and despair in the garden of get 70 he </v>
<v Speaker 8>says,</v>

1499
01:32:39.061 --> 01:32:43.230
<v Speaker 8>my soul is exceedingly sorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Even unto death.</v>

1500
01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:46.200
<v Speaker 8>You shares in the fullness of human </v>
<v Speaker 8>pain.</v>

1501
01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:49.350
<v Speaker 8>He enters into the fullness not only of </v>
<v Speaker 8>human life,</v>

1502
01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:50.873
<v Speaker 8>but if human death,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and we are to understand Christ descent </v>

1503
01:32:54.211 --> 01:32:55.044
<v Speaker 8>into hell as being the full expression </v>
<v Speaker 8>of God's solidarity with our human </v>

1504
01:32:58.951 --> 01:32:59.784
<v Speaker 8>alienation.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Christ descends into the hell of human </v>

1505
01:33:02.461 --> 01:33:04.440
<v Speaker 8>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And if human loneliness,</v>

1506
01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:06.180
<v Speaker 8>loneliness,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a human despair,</v>

1507
01:33:06.540 --> 01:33:09.120
<v Speaker 8>surely he has borne our griefs.</v>

1508
01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:10.193
<v Speaker 8>And carried our sorrows as we read in </v>
<v Speaker 8>the book of Isaiah and we may add that </v>

1509
01:33:13.711 --> 01:33:18.380
<v Speaker 8>Christ has worn all,</v>
<v Speaker 8>all our silos.</v>

1510
01:33:19.050 --> 01:33:19.883
<v Speaker 8>There was a total identification here </v>
<v Speaker 8>and unreserved solidarity of priced our </v>

1511
01:33:23.431 --> 01:33:28.431
<v Speaker 8>God in our human fallenness.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He who is sinless yet became sin for us.</v>

1512
01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:32.250
<v Speaker 8>He became one with us in our foreman's </v>
<v Speaker 8>age as the Paul says,</v>

1513
01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:35.280
<v Speaker 8>and that is part of the meaning of this </v>
<v Speaker 8>descent into hell.</v>

1514
01:33:35.730 --> 01:33:40.730
<v Speaker 8>All things are full of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>even hell though I go down to hell,</v>

1515
01:33:41.010 --> 01:33:46.010
<v Speaker 8>thou art there also maybe you so much,</v>
<v Speaker 8>38 so when we are baptized,</v>

1516
01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:50.730
<v Speaker 8>he love continues.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We just send it priced into hell.</v>

1517
01:33:51.150 --> 01:33:54.780
<v Speaker 8>We also commit ourselves in solidarity </v>
<v Speaker 8>with price to the scene.</v>

1518
01:33:54.810 --> 01:33:58.290
<v Speaker 8>Total unreserved identification with </v>
<v Speaker 8>those who suffer.</v>

1519
01:33:58.770 --> 01:34:03.180
<v Speaker 8>Each of the baptize becomes by virtue of</v>
<v Speaker 8>his descent into hell with Christ,</v>

1520
01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:04.073
<v Speaker 8>a man or a woman for others.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Each of us is called to bear the griefs </v>

1521
01:34:08.671 --> 01:34:13.671
<v Speaker 8>of others is it carry their sorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He a Christian ne to be a human requires</v>

1522
01:34:17.521 --> 01:34:18.354
<v Speaker 8>us to journey to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It is in use terms to journey to hell </v>

1523
01:34:22.830 --> 01:34:23.663
<v Speaker 8>and become hell oneself.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's how we can make sense of the </v>

1524
01:34:27.681 --> 01:34:32.480
<v Speaker 8>words of a great elder of the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 8>century seems sort of Rooney who went as</v>

1525
01:34:32.540 --> 01:34:33.620
<v Speaker 8>a young man,</v>
<v Speaker 8>asked him,</v>

1526
01:34:33.621 --> 01:34:34.454
<v Speaker 8>how will we be saved?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Answered he your mind in Hell and just </v>

1527
01:34:39.091 --> 01:34:39.924
<v Speaker 8>bearing on</v>

1528
01:34:41.430 --> 01:34:42.263
<v Speaker 8>why can't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>why this archetyping descent before </v>

1529
01:34:45.141 --> 01:34:45.974
<v Speaker 8>ascending?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Why The you pattern of Christ that we </v>

1530
01:34:48.561 --> 01:34:51.170
<v Speaker 8>must follow,</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

1531
01:34:51.260 --> 01:34:54.410
<v Speaker 8>as in how much her of physics,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you will indulge me.</v>

1532
01:34:54.411 --> 01:34:55.244
<v Speaker 8>Let me offer a metaphor from physics.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And I'm this from a scholar of Orthodox </v>

1533
01:34:59.181 --> 01:35:04.181
<v Speaker 8>Christian liturgy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>David bigger book archimedes was a Greek</v>

1534
01:35:04.281 --> 01:35:07.460
<v Speaker 8>physicist who was fascinated by the </v>
<v Speaker 8>mechanic and mathematics.</v>

1535
01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:08.593
<v Speaker 8>The lever,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and you may remember from your science </v>

1536
01:35:10.671 --> 01:35:11.504
<v Speaker 8>classes and simple machines that are </v>
<v Speaker 8>lever is used to exert a large force </v>

1537
01:35:14.991 --> 01:35:15.824
<v Speaker 8>over a small distance.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I exerting a small force over a greater </v>

1538
01:35:19.701 --> 01:35:20.534
<v Speaker 8>distance at the other end or a child and</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's lift with one hand and a man </v>

1539
01:35:25.281 --> 01:35:26.114
<v Speaker 8>standing on the shore.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And if the child presses down on the </v>

1540
01:35:29.151 --> 01:35:29.984
<v Speaker 8>long,</v>
<v Speaker 8>archimedes was so fascinated by the </v>

1541
01:35:33.081 --> 01:35:35.690
<v Speaker 8>leavers potential.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Then one day he famously swing,</v>

1542
01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:38.840
<v Speaker 8>give me a lever and a place to stand.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Am I?</v>

1543
01:35:38.841 --> 01:35:39.740
<v Speaker 8>Shall move.</v>

1544
01:35:40.290 --> 01:35:41.123
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

1545
01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:45.620
<v Speaker 8>And he realized three things in order to</v>
<v Speaker 8>move here,</v>

1546
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:46.663
<v Speaker 8>a long enough lever,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a correctly placed fulcrum points and a </v>

1547
01:35:50.421 --> 01:35:51.254
<v Speaker 8>place to stay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But that of course was the problem when </v>

1548
01:35:54.261 --> 01:35:57.590
<v Speaker 8>it comes to moving the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How could he apply leverage to the world</v>

1549
01:35:57.620 --> 01:36:00.090
<v Speaker 8>when he himself was standing on the </v>
<v Speaker 8>world?</v>

1550
01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:03.620
<v Speaker 8>How could he step off the thing he lives</v>
<v Speaker 8>on in order to move it?</v>

1551
01:36:04.190 --> 01:36:07.160
<v Speaker 8>He has no footing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So in philosophy,</v>

1552
01:36:07.161 --> 01:36:10.380
<v Speaker 8>the riddle becomes known as searching </v>
<v Speaker 8>for the archimedean point.</v>

1553
01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:11.713
<v Speaker 8>That is an objective standpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Removed from the object of study is </v>

1554
01:36:15.291 --> 01:36:16.124
<v Speaker 8>hypothetical point of perspective is </v>
<v Speaker 8>thought to be far enough removed from </v>

1555
01:36:18.381 --> 01:36:21.640
<v Speaker 8>something in order to afford an </v>
<v Speaker 8>outsider's view of it.</v>

1556
01:36:22.030 --> 01:36:22.863
<v Speaker 8>How can we remove ourselves to a point </v>
<v Speaker 8>of site oh seven this is our human </v>

1557
01:36:28.221 --> 01:36:29.054
<v Speaker 8>condition.</v>
<v Speaker 8>A gustin defines sin as Info vacs was </v>

1558
01:36:33.291 --> 01:36:36.980
<v Speaker 8>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Being curved in upon oneself.</v>

1559
01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:38.173
<v Speaker 8>I like oriented inwardly towards self </v>
<v Speaker 8>rather than outward towards scarf and </v>

1560
01:36:43.521 --> 01:36:44.354
<v Speaker 8>others are egocentrism exert so strong </v>
<v Speaker 8>gravitational pull that it bends the </v>

1561
01:36:49.581 --> 01:36:50.414
<v Speaker 8>light of glory back on ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That light that should be glorifying </v>

1562
01:36:53.691 --> 01:36:54.524
<v Speaker 8>God.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How can we move ourselves off center </v>

1563
01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:02.770
<v Speaker 8>movie or the center of our universe?</v>
<v Speaker 8>We have no leverage overseeing.</v>

1564
01:37:03.290 --> 01:37:06.590
<v Speaker 8>We have new standpoint outside our </v>
<v Speaker 8>vanity and pride.</v>

1565
01:37:06.830 --> 01:37:09.650
<v Speaker 8>We have no rock on which to stand that </v>
<v Speaker 8>is beyond ourselves.</v>

1566
01:37:09.651 --> 01:37:13.490
<v Speaker 8>Interests,</v>
<v Speaker 8>whoever desires to get outside himself,</v>

1567
01:37:13.790 --> 01:37:16.820
<v Speaker 8>eat some sort of our Canadian points,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the owns and stuff,</v>

1568
01:37:18.810 --> 01:37:19.643
<v Speaker 8>our self offering and are just sent to </v>
<v Speaker 8>hell is precisely this archimedean </v>

1569
01:37:24.990 --> 01:37:27.450
<v Speaker 8>point.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If we are to lift the war,</v>

1570
01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:29.033
<v Speaker 8>if we are to transform the world into a </v>
<v Speaker 8>true symbol and epiphany of God's own </v>

1571
01:37:32.281 --> 01:37:34.800
<v Speaker 8>life and when he was first,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he said,</v>

1572
01:37:35.550 --> 01:37:36.383
<v Speaker 8>we cannot lift up the world in </v>
<v Speaker 8>sacrificial trace along as we placed in </v>

1573
01:37:39.220 --> 01:37:43.240
<v Speaker 8>our footing on the world alone,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's like trying to lift the carpeting.</v>

1574
01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:45.620
<v Speaker 8>Why we stand on it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Archimedes,</v>

1575
01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:46.473
<v Speaker 8>his problem was applying leverage to a </v>
<v Speaker 8>world that he could not step off of in </v>

1576
01:37:49.321 --> 01:37:50.190
<v Speaker 8>order to move it.</v>

1577
01:37:50.980 --> 01:37:51.970
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we can.</v>

1578
01:37:53.130 --> 01:37:56.430
<v Speaker 8>I dying with Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We freed from the roads.</v>

1579
01:37:56.730 --> 01:37:59.070
<v Speaker 8>We leave the world's for the sake of the</v>
<v Speaker 8>world.</v>

1580
01:37:59.310 --> 01:38:03.600
<v Speaker 8>We die so that we in the world with us,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they live.</v>

1581
01:38:04.350 --> 01:38:08.190
<v Speaker 8>This is not nearly our spiritual life,</v>
<v Speaker 8>our religious vocation,</v>

1582
01:38:08.191 --> 01:38:11.940
<v Speaker 8>some crazy notion dreamed up by men with</v>
<v Speaker 8>black dresses</v>

1583
01:38:15.930 --> 01:38:18.780
<v Speaker 8>are true life.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It is our proper life.</v>

1584
01:38:18.810 --> 01:38:19.643
<v Speaker 8>It is our life ordered according to the </v>
<v Speaker 8>logos and it is a journey we must </v>

1585
01:38:24.630 --> 01:38:27.090
<v Speaker 8>undertake.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We undertake not on our own,</v>

1586
01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:28.343
<v Speaker 8>the only in Christ or Christ and Christ </v>
<v Speaker 8>alone is the one who took that journey </v>

1587
01:38:32.670 --> 01:38:37.140
<v Speaker 8>so that we could be reconciled to God.</v>
<v Speaker 8>In closing,</v>

1588
01:38:37.141 --> 01:38:40.530
<v Speaker 8>I would like to turn to one of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>greatest in my own estimation,</v>

1589
01:38:40.531 --> 01:38:41.364
<v Speaker 8>poets of the past century,</v>
<v Speaker 8>one who saw deeply into these realities </v>

1590
01:38:44.971 --> 01:38:48.480
<v Speaker 8>of locals and journey through death and </v>
<v Speaker 8>resurrection.</v>

1591
01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:51.580
<v Speaker 8>He his poem,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the wasteland,</v>

1592
01:38:51.810 --> 01:38:55.460
<v Speaker 8>Tsl,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he depicts a bleak world.</v>

1593
01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:58.650
<v Speaker 8>It's a world in which we fail to take up</v>
<v Speaker 8>our journey,</v>

1594
01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:00.233
<v Speaker 8>where we stay put amidst the </v>
<v Speaker 8>civilization that's been reduced to a </v>

1595
01:39:03.421 --> 01:39:08.160
<v Speaker 8>wasteland that has lost its fertility </v>
<v Speaker 8>and its ability to bring forth life.</v>

1596
01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:13.880
<v Speaker 8>The world is filled.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He says with a heat of broken images and</v>

1597
01:39:15.061 --> 01:39:15.894
<v Speaker 8>the dead tree gives no shelter.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There is no easy fix and certainly </v>

1598
01:39:20.521 --> 01:39:23.550
<v Speaker 8>nothing in that civilization or society </v>
<v Speaker 8>could offer.</v>

1599
01:39:25.110 --> 01:39:27.990
<v Speaker 8>There no levels.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's such a world.</v>

1600
01:39:28.020 --> 01:39:32.760
<v Speaker 8>Sound familiar to us today.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We need to look at Elliot spinal work,</v>

1601
01:39:32.890 --> 01:39:37.160
<v Speaker 8>the four quartets for hope of renewal </v>
<v Speaker 8>and spiritual replenishing,</v>

1602
01:39:38.010 --> 01:39:40.440
<v Speaker 8>telling me above this series of four </v>
<v Speaker 8>posts.</v>

1603
01:39:40.441 --> 01:39:44.880
<v Speaker 8>The last thing he wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he's inscribed those words of hereclitis</v>

1604
01:39:44.881 --> 01:39:45.714
<v Speaker 8>that I mentioned before.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Although logos is common and many live </v>

1605
01:39:48.931 --> 01:39:52.260
<v Speaker 8>as if they had wisdom of their own </v>
<v Speaker 8>elliot headset.</v>

1606
01:39:53.370 --> 01:39:54.203
<v Speaker 8>The solution to our wasteland is not </v>
<v Speaker 8>your new civilization per se on its own </v>

1607
01:39:58.951 --> 01:39:59.784
<v Speaker 8>terms,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but a journey undertaken in the pattern </v>

1608
01:40:02.551 --> 01:40:07.430
<v Speaker 8>of the logos.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He says this,</v>

1609
01:40:07.730 --> 01:40:09.470
<v Speaker 8>it's a symbol perfected.</v>

1610
01:40:10.150 --> 01:40:10.983
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1611
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:16.410
<v Speaker 8>all shall be well and all manner of </v>
<v Speaker 8>things shall be well by the purification</v>

1612
01:40:16.411 --> 01:40:21.411
<v Speaker 8>of the motive in the ground of RBC CIBC,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he goes on to evoke an image,</v>

1613
01:40:22.341 --> 01:40:24.710
<v Speaker 8>this beautiful image of the fire of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>Holy Spirit,</v>

1614
01:40:24.711 --> 01:40:27.650
<v Speaker 8>purifying as a de horrifying the world </v>
<v Speaker 8>is.</v>

1615
01:40:27.651 --> 01:40:31.710
<v Speaker 8>It just says as a dog and he ends with </v>
<v Speaker 8>this on a whole.</v>

1616
01:40:31.711 --> 01:40:32.544
<v Speaker 8>For them in which descends to death is </v>
<v Speaker 8>the source of life and meaning and </v>

1617
01:40:36.771 --> 01:40:37.700
<v Speaker 8>transformation.</v>

1618
01:40:39.250 --> 01:40:42.700
<v Speaker 8>We die with the dying.</v>
<v Speaker 8>See,</v>

1619
01:40:42.701 --> 01:40:47.440
<v Speaker 8>they depart and we go with them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We are born with the Dead Sea,</v>

1620
01:40:47.441 --> 01:40:52.180
<v Speaker 8>they return and bring us with them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The moment of the rose and the moment of</v>

1621
01:40:52.181 --> 01:40:53.014
<v Speaker 8>the huge tree equals your Asian people </v>
<v Speaker 8>without history is not redeemed from </v>

1622
01:40:57.401 --> 01:41:01.360
<v Speaker 8>time for history is a pattern of </v>
<v Speaker 8>timeless moments.</v>

1623
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:06.950
<v Speaker 8>So while the light fails on a winter's </v>
<v Speaker 8>afternoon in a secluded chapel,</v>

1624
01:41:06.970 --> 01:41:11.970
<v Speaker 8>history is now and be the drawing of </v>
<v Speaker 8>this love and the voice of this call,</v>

1625
01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:19.780
<v Speaker 8>we shall not cease from exploration.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And the end of all our exploring will be</v>

1626
01:41:19.781 --> 01:41:20.614
<v Speaker 8>to arrive where we started</v>
<v Speaker 8>and know the place for the first time </v>

1627
01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:29.433
<v Speaker 8>through the unknown remembered gates.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When the last of the earth left to </v>

1628
01:41:32.261 --> 01:41:37.210
<v Speaker 8>discover is that which was the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 8>at the source of the longest river,</v>

1629
01:41:37.211 --> 01:41:40.600
<v Speaker 8>the voice of the hidden waterfall and </v>
<v Speaker 8>the children and the apple tree.</v>

1630
01:41:40.830 --> 01:41:41.663
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

1631
01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:47.280
<v Speaker 8>because not looked for but her half.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's still miss between two waves of the</v>

1632
01:41:47.801 --> 01:41:50.500
<v Speaker 8>sea</v>
<v Speaker 8>here.</v>

1633
01:41:51.130 --> 01:41:51.963
<v Speaker 8>Always condition of complete simplicity,</v>
<v Speaker 8>costing not less and everything and all </v>

1634
01:41:58.931 --> 01:41:59.764
<v Speaker 8>shall be well and all manner of things </v>
<v Speaker 8>shall be well when the tongues of flame </v>

1635
01:42:03.641 --> 01:42:06.390
<v Speaker 8>or enfolded into the crown at and off </v>
<v Speaker 8>the fire.</v>

1636
01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:09.100
<v Speaker 8>And the fire and rose</v>

1637
01:42:18.050 --> 01:42:23.050
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

1638
01:42:29.010 --> 01:42:32.200
<v Speaker 1>what an amazing engine to artists </v>
<v Speaker 1>commissions.</v>

1639
01:42:32.230 --> 01:42:34.570
<v Speaker 1>And I just get another round of applause</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all our patterns.</v>

1640
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:39.790
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

1641
01:42:45.410 --> 01:42:49.850
<v Speaker 1>so it's eight 47 right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just letting you guys know,</v>

1642
01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:50.833
<v Speaker 1>even though a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the event says that the event ends at </v>

1643
01:42:53.271 --> 01:42:58.271
<v Speaker 1>9:00 PM we do have the room til 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we have plenty of time for questions.</v>

1644
01:42:58.890 --> 01:43:01.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so with that said,</v>

1645
01:43:01.730 --> 01:43:06.730
<v Speaker 1>if you guys have anymore questions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop along the way,</v>

1646
01:43:06.771 --> 01:43:09.680
<v Speaker 1>you can just write them down and asked </v>
<v Speaker 1>them up.</v>

1647
01:43:09.740 --> 01:43:10.573
<v Speaker 1>And I always try to get to as many as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible and if I'd ask the questions </v>

1648
01:43:14.121 --> 01:43:19.121
<v Speaker 1>that kind of answer as many other </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions as possible.</v>

1649
01:43:20.150 --> 01:43:25.150
<v Speaker 1>So with that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this question does not adjust to any</v>

1650
01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:27.153
<v Speaker 1>analysts in particular by whichever of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you feels like you would like to answer </v>

1651
01:43:31.101 --> 01:43:32.720
<v Speaker 1>this question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1652
01:43:32.780 --> 01:43:33.613
<v Speaker 1>the do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a statue in Rome depicts the </v>

1653
01:43:35.751 --> 01:43:40.280
<v Speaker 1>suffering of the Trojan priest Lado Con,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pronouncing that correctly.</v>

1654
01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:41.353
<v Speaker 1>And his sons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlike the noble suffering of Christ on </v>

1655
01:43:46.110 --> 01:43:46.943
<v Speaker 1>sufferer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of sufferings science seems neither </v>

1656
01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:52.040
<v Speaker 1>awarded nor justified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do these two</v>

1657
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:57.040
<v Speaker 6>differing visions of suffering form part</v>
<v Speaker 6>of the divide between postmodernists and</v>

1658
01:43:57.231 --> 01:44:02.231
<v Speaker 6>their opponents and do the postmodernist</v>
<v Speaker 6>justify their nihilism and or believe in</v>

1659
01:44:02.961 --> 01:44:03.794
<v Speaker 6>other ideologies by pointing to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>pointless suffering a lot of time and </v>

1660
01:44:07.341 --> 01:44:11.430
<v Speaker 6>others like him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't have a harder question.</v>

1661
01:44:13.730 --> 01:44:14.563
<v Speaker 6>He'll be answering this</v>

1662
01:44:17.890 --> 01:44:20.700
<v Speaker 9>like to</v>
<v Speaker 9>anyone.</v>

1663
01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:28.640
<v Speaker 6>It's about sculpture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well meaning,</v>

1664
01:44:28.780 --> 01:44:31.870
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>indeck is just meaningless suffering.</v>

1665
01:44:33.490 --> 01:44:38.230
<v Speaker 6>Is that the core of the postmodern </v>
<v Speaker 6>understanding goats,</v>

1666
01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:39.610
<v Speaker 6>the problems in the world?</v>

1667
01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:49.260
<v Speaker 9>I don't know if it's at the core,</v>
<v Speaker 9>precisely</v>

1668
01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:55.200
<v Speaker 6>of the postmodernists view.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's at the core of</v>

1669
01:44:56.850 --> 01:44:57.683
<v Speaker 6>the problem that every human being has </v>
<v Speaker 6>with manifesting sufficient faith to </v>

1670
01:45:01.141 --> 01:45:02.490
<v Speaker 6>engage fully in life.</v>

1671
01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:09.580
<v Speaker 6>We look at our lives and the lives of </v>
<v Speaker 6>others and we see that the one certainty</v>

1672
01:45:09.831 --> 01:45:14.831
<v Speaker 6>is suffering and loss and we're at least</v>
<v Speaker 6>in principle,</v>

1673
01:45:14.991 --> 01:45:16.910
<v Speaker 6>the only creatures that are aware of </v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

1674
01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:20.120
<v Speaker 6>That's really the story in genesis of </v>
<v Speaker 6>Adam and eve.</v>

1675
01:45:20.121 --> 01:45:20.954
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because Adam and eve wake up and become </v>

1676
01:45:22.641 --> 01:45:23.474
<v Speaker 6>aware of their own nakedness there </v>
<v Speaker 6>finitude your mortality and that throws </v>

1677
01:45:28.151 --> 01:45:30.470
<v Speaker 6>them out of the paradise of being and </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

1678
01:45:30.490 --> 01:45:31.323
<v Speaker 6>that's precisely right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the situation we all find </v>

1679
01:45:33.081 --> 01:45:33.914
<v Speaker 6>ourselves in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The fundamental question is all that </v>

1680
01:45:37.340 --> 01:45:41.630
<v Speaker 6>without ultimate meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's a very profound question.</v>

1681
01:45:42.540 --> 01:45:43.373
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

1682
01:45:44.330 --> 01:45:45.163
<v Speaker 6>The answer seems to be something like </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's without meaning unless you take it </v>

1683
01:45:47.811 --> 01:45:50.360
<v Speaker 6>on voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I don't,</v>

1684
01:45:50.810 --> 01:45:54.830
<v Speaker 6>I certainly don't understand the full </v>
<v Speaker 6>implications of that answer,</v>

1685
01:45:54.831 --> 01:45:55.664
<v Speaker 6>although I know that in so far as you </v>
<v Speaker 6>can test that as a theory in your own </v>

1686
01:46:00.531 --> 01:46:02.930
<v Speaker 6>life,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it seems extraordinarily robust.</v>

1687
01:46:05.380 --> 01:46:05.850
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

1688
01:46:05.850 --> 01:46:07.800
<v Speaker 6>To the degree that it's a postmodern </v>
<v Speaker 6>issue,</v>

1689
01:46:07.801 --> 01:46:08.634
<v Speaker 6>I think that the postmodernists </v>
<v Speaker 6>postmodernists feed us very thin rule </v>

1690
01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:18.440
<v Speaker 6>because they offer nothing in the face </v>
<v Speaker 6>of that suffering except the collapse of</v>

1691
01:46:20.501 --> 01:46:23.360
<v Speaker 6>everything into the sound that Jonathan </v>
<v Speaker 6>spoke up.</v>

1692
01:46:26.050 --> 01:46:27.670
<v Speaker 6>That's the best I can do with that.</v>

1693
01:46:29.460 --> 01:46:30.293
<v Speaker 9>Great.</v>

1694
01:46:34.050 --> 01:46:34.883
<v Speaker 6>To Mr Patio,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how do your icons and icons and general </v>

1695
01:46:38.941 --> 01:46:43.440
<v Speaker 6>function on their day to day search for </v>
<v Speaker 6>the logos?</v>

1696
01:46:51.810 --> 01:46:52.643
<v Speaker 9>MMM,</v>

1697
01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:54.350
<v Speaker 10>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I think they,</v>

1698
01:46:54.510 --> 01:46:57.490
<v Speaker 10>there's many ways in which they </v>
<v Speaker 10>function.</v>

1699
01:46:58.110 --> 01:46:58.760
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

1700
01:46:58.760 --> 01:46:59.593
<v Speaker 10>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>one of the things that I did I talked </v>

1701
01:47:01.881 --> 01:47:02.714
<v Speaker 10>about is the idea that the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the path of logos is a path of coming </v>

1702
01:47:06.951 --> 01:47:11.450
<v Speaker 10>together.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And one of the things that icons provide</v>

1703
01:47:11.451 --> 01:47:16.451
<v Speaker 10>is that image of coming together.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So when you engage with an icon,</v>

1704
01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:21.260
<v Speaker 10>especially in a church where there are </v>
<v Speaker 10>many icons and many saints,</v>

1705
01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:22.333
<v Speaker 10>then you get that sense of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>your path being one in which you are in </v>

1706
01:47:28.311 --> 01:47:31.400
<v Speaker 10>communion with others.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And so for Orthodox Christian,</v>

1707
01:47:31.401 --> 01:47:33.800
<v Speaker 10>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 10>when we prayed before icons,</v>

1708
01:47:33.801 --> 01:47:34.510
<v Speaker 10>we,</v>
<v Speaker 10>we,</v>

1709
01:47:34.510 --> 01:47:38.630
<v Speaker 10>we pray before them because through the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>through those images,</v>

1710
01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:39.800
<v Speaker 10>we,</v>
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

1711
01:47:43.150 --> 01:47:44.020
<v Speaker 10>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 10>we can,</v>

1712
01:47:44.021 --> 01:47:46.240
<v Speaker 10>how can I say this in a,</v>
<v Speaker 10>in a way that can,</v>

1713
01:47:46.241 --> 01:47:47.074
<v Speaker 10>everybody can understand.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So the image becomes a vehicle for the </v>

1714
01:47:49.511 --> 01:47:52.780
<v Speaker 10>presence of that person into our prayer </v>
<v Speaker 10>lives.</v>

1715
01:47:52.781 --> 01:47:55.510
<v Speaker 10>And there's this relationship which is,</v>
<v Speaker 10>which is set up.</v>

1716
01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:59.800
<v Speaker 10>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that is how we live with icons and icons</v>

1717
01:47:59.801 --> 01:48:00.980
<v Speaker 10>become a,</v>
<v Speaker 10>a,</v>

1718
01:48:00.981 --> 01:48:04.000
<v Speaker 10>a vehicle for that,</v>
<v Speaker 10>for that path towards,</v>

1719
01:48:04.150 --> 01:48:06.640
<v Speaker 10>towards unity.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So I hope that helps.</v>

1720
01:48:06.641 --> 01:48:07.421
<v Speaker 10>That's on,</v>
<v Speaker 10>let's say,</v>

1721
01:48:07.421 --> 01:48:10.210
<v Speaker 10>on a experiential,</v>
<v Speaker 10>a sense,</v>

1722
01:48:10.211 --> 01:48:11.044
<v Speaker 10>I think in a technical sense,</v>
<v Speaker 10>in terms of the making of icons for </v>

1723
01:48:13.961 --> 01:48:15.740
<v Speaker 10>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

1724
01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:17.193
<v Speaker 10>for me that's what they have done </v>
<v Speaker 10>exactly is that my struggle in life </v>

1725
01:48:22.090 --> 01:48:27.090
<v Speaker 10>before I became orthodox was how to fit </v>
<v Speaker 10>art that I loved into my life.</v>

1726
01:48:29.530 --> 01:48:32.650
<v Speaker 10>How to make that fit and how for it to </v>
<v Speaker 10>all come together.</v>

1727
01:48:32.830 --> 01:48:35.410
<v Speaker 10>And in discovering the language of </v>
<v Speaker 10>traditional Christian art,</v>

1728
01:48:35.620 --> 01:48:36.453
<v Speaker 10>I found how here's this art,</v>
<v Speaker 10>which is both grounded in absolute </v>

1729
01:48:40.031 --> 01:48:44.290
<v Speaker 10>practical use in the lives of people.</v>

1730
01:48:44.290 --> 01:48:46.210
<v Speaker 10>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's used in people's devotions.</v>

1731
01:48:46.211 --> 01:48:49.030
<v Speaker 10>It's using the church to teach and to </v>
<v Speaker 10>participate in the liturgy.</v>

1732
01:48:49.330 --> 01:48:50.163
<v Speaker 10>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and at the same time I can participate </v>

1733
01:48:52.361 --> 01:48:54.610
<v Speaker 10>in that by making them,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uniting me with,</v>

1734
01:48:54.790 --> 01:48:58.900
<v Speaker 10>with the tradition of all the fathers </v>
<v Speaker 10>before me uniting you with the church.</v>

1735
01:48:59.050 --> 01:49:00.820
<v Speaker 10>And at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 10>these images,</v>

1736
01:49:00.821 --> 01:49:01.654
<v Speaker 10>what they're talking about and what </v>
<v Speaker 10>they're revealing is that ultimate </v>

1737
01:49:04.570 --> 01:49:05.403
<v Speaker 10>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that reality that is beyond all </v>

1738
01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:10.600
<v Speaker 10>realities.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And so being able for myself,</v>

1739
01:49:10.601 --> 01:49:15.601
<v Speaker 10>I feel great blessing to have the chance</v>
<v Speaker 10>and have the,</v>

1740
01:49:16.020 --> 01:49:16.853
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the blessing of the church to be able </v>

1741
01:49:17.951 --> 01:49:19.360
<v Speaker 10>to,</v>
<v Speaker 10>to do that for a living.</v>

1742
01:49:19.361 --> 01:49:22.930
<v Speaker 10>It's amazing every day I get to </v>
<v Speaker 10>participate in that process.</v>

1743
01:49:23.230 --> 01:49:24.070
<v Speaker 10>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

1744
01:49:24.130 --> 01:49:26.080
<v Speaker 10>that's my other answer to that question.</v>

1745
01:49:31.930 --> 01:49:32.763
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

1746
01:49:34.410 --> 01:49:35.243
<v Speaker 11>Just quickly to add to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 11>icons in the Orthodox church or not </v>

1747
01:49:39.571 --> 01:49:42.570
<v Speaker 11>merely seen,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but they teach us to see,</v>

1748
01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:45.450
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you will have noted that there is a,</v>

1749
01:49:46.290 --> 01:49:50.200
<v Speaker 11>they're not just an aesthetically </v>
<v Speaker 11>beautiful medium.</v>

1750
01:49:50.420 --> 01:49:52.720
<v Speaker 11>They have a kind of stylization even,</v>
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

1751
01:49:52.780 --> 01:49:54.850
<v Speaker 11>even though the mini styles of </v>
<v Speaker 11>iconography,</v>

1752
01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:55.833
<v Speaker 11>they share a characteristic and that </v>
<v Speaker 11>there is something about them that </v>

1753
01:49:59.201 --> 01:50:04.201
<v Speaker 11>forces the viewer to reflect and to come</v>
<v Speaker 11>to a new way of seeing.</v>

1754
01:50:05.620 --> 01:50:06.453
<v Speaker 11>So icons are not merely symbols as such,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but they teach us to understand all of </v>

1755
01:50:11.441 --> 01:50:14.410
<v Speaker 11>reality in that symbolic sense that I </v>
<v Speaker 11>spoke of earlier,</v>

1756
01:50:14.411 --> 01:50:18.430
<v Speaker 11>that everything ultimately isn't </v>
<v Speaker 11>referencing itself.</v>

1757
01:50:18.670 --> 01:50:19.503
<v Speaker 11>That's the problem that we are in.</v>
<v Speaker 11>That things have become self </v>

1758
01:50:21.921 --> 01:50:25.360
<v Speaker 11>referential,</v>
<v Speaker 11>that everything in the world is an icon,</v>

1759
01:50:25.361 --> 01:50:26.194
<v Speaker 11>is a symbol of God.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And it's referring to something much </v>

1760
01:50:29.081 --> 01:50:33.430
<v Speaker 11>more than what it is beyond itself </v>
<v Speaker 11>without losing its identity.</v>

1761
01:50:33.431 --> 01:50:37.480
<v Speaker 11>So icons teach us that vision not just </v>
<v Speaker 11>depicted.</v>

1762
01:50:37.870 --> 01:50:39.690
<v Speaker 11>That makes sense to teach us a way of </v>
<v Speaker 11>seeing.</v>

1763
01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:44.730
<v Speaker 12>Just a quick reminder that I'm following</v>
<v Speaker 12>up on a professional.</v>

1764
01:50:44.731 --> 01:50:46.240
<v Speaker 12>Peterson said,</v>
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>

1765
01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:52.400
<v Speaker 12>there's the average person wants to take</v>
<v Speaker 12>the easy route,</v>

1766
01:50:53.010 --> 01:50:53.843
<v Speaker 12>right?</v>
<v Speaker 12>So when you take a look at icons and </v>

1767
01:50:55.831 --> 01:50:56.664
<v Speaker 12>Orthodox church,</v>
<v Speaker 12>there's a lot of people who've never </v>

1768
01:50:57.121 --> 01:50:57.901
<v Speaker 12>seen them before.</v>
<v Speaker 12>They say,</v>

1769
01:50:57.901 --> 01:50:58.740
<v Speaker 12>well,</v>
<v Speaker 12>those are weird.</v>

1770
01:50:58.741 --> 01:50:58.961
<v Speaker 12>They,</v>
<v Speaker 12>they,</v>

1771
01:50:58.961 --> 01:51:01.230
<v Speaker 12>they're not realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 12>They're very strange looking.</v>

1772
01:51:01.580 --> 01:51:04.320
<v Speaker 12>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 12>they're done on purpose because the icon</v>

1773
01:51:04.321 --> 01:51:06.030
<v Speaker 12>involves you.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Okay?</v>

1774
01:51:06.150 --> 01:51:09.700
<v Speaker 12>It forces engagement with the local,</v>
<v Speaker 12>well,</v>

1775
01:51:09.740 --> 01:51:10.573
<v Speaker 12>we've been speaking about tonight </v>
<v Speaker 12>because from the colors that are used </v>

1776
01:51:13.531 --> 01:51:14.940
<v Speaker 12>to,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1777
01:51:14.970 --> 01:51:18.390
<v Speaker 12>the subtle code that exists within </v>
<v Speaker 12>iconography that,</v>

1778
01:51:18.391 --> 01:51:19.410
<v Speaker 12>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 12>if you haven't studied it,</v>

1779
01:51:19.411 --> 01:51:20.244
<v Speaker 12>you wouldn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 12>But if for the people who read up on it </v>

1780
01:51:21.631 --> 01:51:24.140
<v Speaker 12>and begin to engage,</v>
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>

1781
01:51:24.690 --> 01:51:25.523
<v Speaker 12>it forces you to read the icon and to </v>
<v Speaker 12>get deeper and deeper into what it's </v>

1782
01:51:28.471 --> 01:51:30.570
<v Speaker 12>trying to tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Even the prospective.</v>

1783
01:51:30.571 --> 01:51:32.970
<v Speaker 12>And Jonathan knows us very well in most </v>
<v Speaker 12>icons,</v>

1784
01:51:32.971 --> 01:51:35.160
<v Speaker 12>not all,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but in most Byzantine icons,</v>

1785
01:51:35.370 --> 01:51:38.940
<v Speaker 12>the perspective is even reversed and if </v>
<v Speaker 12>those of you are taking basic art,</v>

1786
01:51:39.450 --> 01:51:41.940
<v Speaker 12>you know vanishing point is far away,</v>
<v Speaker 12>right?</v>

1787
01:51:41.940 --> 01:51:44.160
<v Speaker 12>Things get further away when you get,</v>
<v Speaker 12>when you get,</v>

1788
01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:45.113
<v Speaker 12>when you look,</v>
<v Speaker 12>when you look into the distance and </v>

1789
01:51:46.531 --> 01:51:48.000
<v Speaker 12>things get bigger when they get closer </v>
<v Speaker 12>to you.</v>

1790
01:51:48.210 --> 01:51:50.670
<v Speaker 12>But if you look at the geometry of an </v>
<v Speaker 12>icon,</v>

1791
01:51:51.070 --> 01:51:52.920
<v Speaker 12>a lot of times you'll see that it's </v>
<v Speaker 12>reversed.</v>

1792
01:51:52.950 --> 01:51:53.551
<v Speaker 12>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 12>why?</v>

1793
01:51:53.551 --> 01:51:56.220
<v Speaker 12>Because the vanishing point is actually </v>
<v Speaker 12>pointing towards you,</v>

1794
01:51:57.360 --> 01:52:01.950
<v Speaker 12>towards the viewer,</v>
<v Speaker 12>which means that when you look at it,</v>

1795
01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:03.353
<v Speaker 12>you become part of it and the </v>
<v Speaker 12>orientation of the icon is actually </v>

1796
01:52:06.541 --> 01:52:09.030
<v Speaker 12>looking at you.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You're not just looking at the icon.</v>

1797
01:52:09.210 --> 01:52:10.043
<v Speaker 12>The icon is looking at you and that </v>
<v Speaker 12>forces a type of involvement and it's </v>

1798
01:52:13.711 --> 01:52:15.810
<v Speaker 12>hard work because if the learn how to </v>
<v Speaker 12>read it,</v>

1799
01:52:16.230 --> 01:52:19.830
<v Speaker 12>you can't just look at it and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 12>want to contrast it as with with,</v>

1800
01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:20.873
<v Speaker 12>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 12>renaissance painting as as better or </v>

1801
01:52:22.291 --> 01:52:23.580
<v Speaker 12>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's just two different things.</v>

1802
01:52:23.581 --> 01:52:24.780
<v Speaker 12>But when you look at renaissance </v>
<v Speaker 12>painting,</v>

1803
01:52:25.170 --> 01:52:27.720
<v Speaker 12>it's realism.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's just,</v>

1804
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:32.040
<v Speaker 12>it's there to depict what exists as it </v>
<v Speaker 12>is.</v>

1805
01:52:32.130 --> 01:52:32.963
<v Speaker 12>And there's not a lot of work there.</v>
<v Speaker 12>There's a lot of work from us from a </v>

1806
01:52:34.441 --> 01:52:37.170
<v Speaker 12>technical point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 12>But to look at it,</v>

1807
01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:38.640
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>there's,</v>

1808
01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:40.620
<v Speaker 12>it is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It stops there.</v>

1809
01:52:40.650 --> 01:52:42.570
<v Speaker 12>Whereas the icon,</v>
<v Speaker 12>as Jonathan was saying,</v>

1810
01:52:42.770 --> 01:52:45.410
<v Speaker 12>it kind of reveals another world,</v>

1811
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:49.220
<v Speaker 6>the world that could be the world that </v>
<v Speaker 6>we would want to be.</v>

1812
01:52:49.730 --> 01:52:50.650
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

1813
01:52:50.690 --> 01:52:51.523
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that is a beautiful thing because </v>

1814
01:52:52.371 --> 01:52:55.310
<v Speaker 6>it's a constant engagement with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with um,</v>

1815
01:52:55.430 --> 01:52:59.750
<v Speaker 6>with our hope in the eternal.</v>

1816
01:53:03.300 --> 01:53:04.133
<v Speaker 9>Thank you.</v>

1817
01:53:05.260 --> 01:53:06.093
<v Speaker 1>This question is for Jordan Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you comment on the cyclical or non </v>

1818
01:53:10.691 --> 01:53:11.524
<v Speaker 1>cyclical pattern of history and if our </v>
<v Speaker 1>society is doomed to decay or can it be </v>

1819
01:53:15.981 --> 01:53:17.380
<v Speaker 1>renewed culturally?</v>

1820
01:53:17.790 --> 01:53:18.623
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>

1821
01:53:20.030 --> 01:53:23.030
<v Speaker 1>in order of society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>state and laws.</v>

1822
01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:26.333
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

1823
01:53:33.170 --> 01:53:34.003
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would say it's cyclical at every </v>

1824
01:53:36.321 --> 01:53:37.154
<v Speaker 6>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In some sense it's nested patterns of </v>

1825
01:53:40.761 --> 01:53:41.594
<v Speaker 6>cyclicality and I think you can hear </v>
<v Speaker 6>that best in the best representation </v>

1826
01:53:46.281 --> 01:53:49.520
<v Speaker 6>I've ever seen of that is inbox </v>
<v Speaker 6>Brandenburg concertos.</v>

1827
01:53:49.960 --> 01:53:51.820
<v Speaker 6>Here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're really worth a listen.</v>

1828
01:53:51.870 --> 01:53:55.730
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the new videos I'm going to release that</v>

1829
01:53:55.731 --> 01:53:59.390
<v Speaker 6>I'm doing with interviews use Bach's </v>
<v Speaker 6>third Brandenburg Concerto,</v>

1830
01:53:59.391 --> 01:54:00.224
<v Speaker 6>which is an absolutely phenomenal piece </v>
<v Speaker 6>of music because it its cycles and </v>

1831
01:54:04.401 --> 01:54:07.910
<v Speaker 6>climbs continually and stays in the same</v>
<v Speaker 6>place.</v>

1832
01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.730
<v Speaker 6>I have no idea how he managed it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

1833
01:54:09.731 --> 01:54:14.060
<v Speaker 6>it's absolutely overwhelming and that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>what history is like.</v>

1834
01:54:14.450 --> 01:54:16.790
<v Speaker 6>The apocalypse is always on us,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1835
01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:17.713
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you all confront an apocalyptic </v>

1836
01:54:19.161 --> 01:54:19.994
<v Speaker 6>yesterday because you're all going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>die and everything comes to an end and </v>

1837
01:54:24.291 --> 01:54:25.124
<v Speaker 6>everything is continually regenerate it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so that cyclicality is built into </v>

1838
01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:29.653
<v Speaker 6>every moment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the u shaped journey that </v>

1839
01:54:31.491 --> 01:54:32.324
<v Speaker 6>northrop Frye talked about too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is order a descent into chaos and </v>

1840
01:54:35.961 --> 01:54:36.794
<v Speaker 6>the reestablishment of order and </v>
<v Speaker 6>everyone knows what that means in their </v>

1841
01:54:39.441 --> 01:54:40.130
<v Speaker 6>own life.</v>

1842
01:54:40.130 --> 01:54:40.963
<v Speaker 6>You're somewhere stable where you </v>
<v Speaker 6>understand everything and things are </v>

1843
01:54:44.451 --> 01:54:48.290
<v Speaker 6>going well for you and then the rug is </v>
<v Speaker 6>pulled out from underneath your feet and</v>

1844
01:54:48.291 --> 01:54:50.810
<v Speaker 6>you don't know where you are or you fall</v>
<v Speaker 6>into chaos.</v>

1845
01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:51.673
<v Speaker 6>Someone close to you dies or you don't </v>
<v Speaker 6>get the promotion you were looking for </v>

1846
01:54:54.500 --> 01:54:55.333
<v Speaker 6>some dream collapses on you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You discover a new fault that you were </v>

1847
01:54:58.041 --> 01:55:01.580
<v Speaker 6>never aware of before and you fall into </v>
<v Speaker 6>this chaotic state.</v>

1848
01:55:01.581 --> 01:55:02.414
<v Speaker 6>And in that chaotic state,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the underworld of mythology and </v>

1849
01:55:05.420 --> 01:55:08.540
<v Speaker 6>one of the suburbs of the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of the underworld,</v>

1850
01:55:08.541 --> 01:55:11.480
<v Speaker 6>the most horrific suburb of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>underworld is hell.</v>

1851
01:55:11.510 --> 01:55:14.600
<v Speaker 6>Because when you go into the underworld </v>
<v Speaker 6>in chaos,</v>

1852
01:55:14.870 --> 01:55:15.703
<v Speaker 6>it's easy to become desperate and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>angry and then vengeful and then </v>

1853
01:55:18.261 --> 01:55:19.094
<v Speaker 6>murderous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that that happens to people with a </v>

1854
01:55:21.261 --> 01:55:24.170
<v Speaker 6>tremendous,</v>
<v Speaker 6>tremendous frequency.</v>

1855
01:55:24.171 --> 01:55:26.120
<v Speaker 6>If you haven't observed that in your own</v>
<v Speaker 6>life,</v>

1856
01:55:26.121 --> 01:55:30.800
<v Speaker 6>you haven't watched your own interior </v>
<v Speaker 6>interior landscape with,</v>

1857
01:55:30.860 --> 01:55:35.390
<v Speaker 6>with any degree of accuracy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so that cyclicality is,</v>

1858
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:39.560
<v Speaker 6>is built into everything and it's the </v>
<v Speaker 6>structure of,</v>

1859
01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:42.410
<v Speaker 6>it's the structure of being that's the </v>
<v Speaker 6>right way to think about it.</v>

1860
01:55:42.420 --> 01:55:43.960
<v Speaker 6>And okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1861
01:55:43.961 --> 01:55:44.100
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1862
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:44.933
<v Speaker 13>I think the optimistic part of that is </v>
<v Speaker 13>that there is a spiral upward as far as </v>

1863
01:55:48.611 --> 01:55:50.230
<v Speaker 13>I can tell her.</v>
<v Speaker 13>At least there can be.</v>

1864
01:55:50.231 --> 01:55:53.980
<v Speaker 13>And you get some sense of that when,</v>
<v Speaker 13>when you participate in your own life,</v>

1865
01:55:53.981 --> 01:55:56.920
<v Speaker 13>in the sense that you've found a good </v>
<v Speaker 13>direction and that's,</v>

1866
01:55:56.980 --> 01:55:59.920
<v Speaker 13>that's in viewing you with a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 13>positive meaning.</v>

1867
01:56:00.100 --> 01:56:00.933
<v Speaker 13>And I really regard,</v>
<v Speaker 13>I don't regard positive meaning as a </v>

1868
01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:04.353
<v Speaker 13>epic,</v>
<v Speaker 13>phenomenal manifestation of a deeper </v>

1869
01:56:06.161 --> 01:56:08.740
<v Speaker 13>material reality.</v>
<v Speaker 13>I don't believe that's true at all.</v>

1870
01:56:09.010 --> 01:56:12.190
<v Speaker 13>I believe that there is nothing more </v>
<v Speaker 13>real than that sense of,</v>

1871
01:56:12.490 --> 01:56:15.730
<v Speaker 13>of engaged meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 13>I think your nervous system has actually</v>

1872
01:56:15.731 --> 01:56:20.140
<v Speaker 13>evolved to tell you when you're in the </v>
<v Speaker 13>right place at the right time.</v>

1873
01:56:20.141 --> 01:56:24.670
<v Speaker 13>It's something that informs you.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It's literally beyond your census,</v>

1874
01:56:24.671 --> 01:56:25.504
<v Speaker 13>but,</v>
<v Speaker 13>but it's absolutely central to proper </v>

1875
01:56:27.221 --> 01:56:28.054
<v Speaker 13>being.</v>
<v Speaker 13>You can tell when you're engaged with </v>

1876
01:56:29.531 --> 01:56:30.364
<v Speaker 13>the world property because all of a </v>
<v Speaker 13>sudden the world becomes worthwhile </v>

1877
01:56:32.891 --> 01:56:33.724
<v Speaker 13>around you.</v>

1878
01:56:34.030 --> 01:56:34.861
<v Speaker 13>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 13>that's,</v>

1879
01:56:34.861 --> 01:56:37.240
<v Speaker 13>that's not an illusion we'd been taught </v>
<v Speaker 13>for so long.</v>

1880
01:56:37.241 --> 01:56:40.540
<v Speaker 13>That meaning is some sort of illusion or</v>
<v Speaker 13>an epi phenomenon.</v>

1881
01:56:40.750 --> 01:56:41.583
<v Speaker 13>I think it's absolutely central and </v>
<v Speaker 13>certainly no one ever thinks that </v>

1882
01:56:44.621 --> 01:56:45.454
<v Speaker 13>suffering is an epithet.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Nominate everyone acts as if their own </v>

1883
01:56:47.741 --> 01:56:49.840
<v Speaker 13>suffering is the most real thing there </v>
<v Speaker 13>is.</v>

1884
01:56:49.841 --> 01:56:51.730
<v Speaker 13>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 13>and a no wonder.</v>

1885
01:56:52.150 --> 01:56:52.983
<v Speaker 13>So if you experience something that </v>
<v Speaker 13>enables you to transcend that suffering </v>

1886
01:56:56.141 --> 01:56:56.974
<v Speaker 13>or to justify it in your own life,</v>
<v Speaker 13>which is that sense of meaningful </v>

1887
01:56:59.111 --> 01:56:59.944
<v Speaker 13>engagement,</v>
<v Speaker 13>why wouldn't you regard that as even </v>

1888
01:57:01.571 --> 01:57:02.404
<v Speaker 13>more real than pain?</v>
<v Speaker 13>The only thing more real than pain is </v>

1889
01:57:05.141 --> 01:57:08.550
<v Speaker 13>that which can transcend it and you can </v>
<v Speaker 13>experience that in your own life.</v>

1890
01:57:08.570 --> 01:57:11.590
<v Speaker 13>You do that all the time when you were </v>
<v Speaker 13>in the right place at the right time.</v>

1891
01:57:11.770 --> 01:57:12.603
<v Speaker 13>It's a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And I also think that's the place that </v>

1892
01:57:15.541 --> 01:57:20.170
<v Speaker 13>truth puts you well now,</v>
<v Speaker 13>how that relates to the cyclicality.</v>

1893
01:57:20.380 --> 01:57:22.300
<v Speaker 13>Well that's the pathway out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 13>You know,</v>

1894
01:57:23.110 --> 01:57:25.870
<v Speaker 13>life is order,</v>
<v Speaker 13>chaos,</v>

1895
01:57:25.990 --> 01:57:27.850
<v Speaker 13>reestablishment of order.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And you could say,</v>

1896
01:57:27.851 --> 01:57:29.170
<v Speaker 13>well,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you're the order.</v>

1897
01:57:29.770 --> 01:57:33.370
<v Speaker 13>Or You could say you're the chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 13>lots of people or the chaos,</v>

1898
01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:36.610
<v Speaker 13>or maybe you're even at Denison of hell </v>
<v Speaker 13>inside that chaos,</v>

1899
01:57:36.760 --> 01:57:37.593
<v Speaker 13>or you're the reestablished order and </v>
<v Speaker 13>all of those things are reasonable </v>

1900
01:57:41.021 --> 01:57:41.854
<v Speaker 13>things to be.</v>
<v Speaker 13>But the most reasonable thing to be is </v>

1901
01:57:43.751 --> 01:57:47.860
<v Speaker 13>the thing that constantly moves along </v>
<v Speaker 13>that pathway ever upwards.</v>

1902
01:57:47.861 --> 01:57:50.020
<v Speaker 13>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 13>like that staircase at the back,</v>

1903
01:57:50.021 --> 01:57:52.870
<v Speaker 13>which is what that represents.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It's that spiral upwards.</v>

1904
01:57:52.871 --> 01:57:55.270
<v Speaker 13>You know that leads us up into the </v>
<v Speaker 13>beyond.</v>

1905
01:57:55.271 --> 01:57:58.690
<v Speaker 13>That's the stairway to heaven and that </v>
<v Speaker 13>cyclicality and and it's,</v>

1906
01:57:58.691 --> 01:58:01.150
<v Speaker 13>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 13>it's a genuine thing and you,</v>

1907
01:58:01.180 --> 01:58:03.460
<v Speaker 13>you know it but you don't know you know </v>
<v Speaker 13>it.</v>

1908
01:58:03.850 --> 01:58:04.683
<v Speaker 13>And some of these stories,</v>
<v Speaker 13>the icons that Jonathan produces in </v>

1909
01:58:06.731 --> 01:58:07.564
<v Speaker 13>these stories that we've been talking </v>
<v Speaker 13>about her are humanities attempts to </v>

1910
01:58:10.331 --> 01:58:11.164
<v Speaker 13>make that pattern articulate and all </v>
<v Speaker 13>we've really managed so far is to </v>

1911
01:58:14.501 --> 01:58:15.334
<v Speaker 13>capture that image and story.</v>
<v Speaker 13>We haven't enabled to make it fully </v>

1912
01:58:17.891 --> 01:58:18.724
<v Speaker 13>articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 13>but the time for that I would say is </v>

1913
01:58:20.891 --> 01:58:21.724
<v Speaker 13>approaching because we need to </v>
<v Speaker 13>understand these things consciously so </v>

1914
01:58:24.041 --> 01:58:25.960
<v Speaker 13>that we could participate in them </v>
<v Speaker 13>properly.</v>

1915
01:58:31.620 --> 01:58:32.453
<v Speaker 9>Thank you.</v>

1916
01:58:33.690 --> 01:58:37.560
<v Speaker 13>This one I suppose would be most </v>
<v Speaker 13>appropriate for our reverend fathers.</v>

1917
01:58:37.630 --> 01:58:42.070
<v Speaker 13>What role does Jesus Christ and the </v>
<v Speaker 13>church play in helping us to become</v>

1918
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:42.903
<v Speaker 11>more like God?</v>
<v Speaker 11>Is it possible to become like God </v>

1919
01:58:45.311 --> 01:58:48.760
<v Speaker 11>without this person and this </v>
<v Speaker 11>institution?</v>

1920
01:58:49.340 --> 01:58:50.173
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1921
01:58:51.330 --> 01:58:52.250
<v Speaker 11>One wants to start.</v>

1922
01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:07.470
<v Speaker 11>This is obviously one of the hotly </v>
<v Speaker 11>debated subjects in Church history.</v>

1923
01:59:07.931 --> 01:59:11.650
<v Speaker 11>It's also a major subject in the New </v>
<v Speaker 11>Testament Teaching New Testament.</v>

1924
01:59:11.651 --> 01:59:15.910
<v Speaker 11>This term and reading Paul recently and </v>
<v Speaker 11>whole wrestles with this question,</v>

1925
01:59:15.911 --> 01:59:16.990
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>how is it,</v>

1926
01:59:17.500 --> 01:59:18.880
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>under the law,</v>

1927
01:59:18.970 --> 01:59:20.380
<v Speaker 11>outside of the law,</v>
<v Speaker 11>how do people,</v>

1928
01:59:20.410 --> 01:59:22.630
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>come to uh,</v>

1929
01:59:22.900 --> 01:59:27.400
<v Speaker 11>this sort of center of being this,</v>
<v Speaker 11>this school film into a few manatees,</v>

1930
01:59:27.401 --> 01:59:29.680
<v Speaker 11>potential human flourishing,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

1931
01:59:29.950 --> 01:59:32.560
<v Speaker 11>with or without Christ and I,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

1932
01:59:33.010 --> 01:59:35.140
<v Speaker 11>depending on how the is asking,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you look at different,</v>

1933
01:59:35.650 --> 01:59:36.483
<v Speaker 11>different answers.</v>
<v Speaker 11>But I would just recall one of the main </v>

1934
01:59:38.981 --> 01:59:43.981
<v Speaker 11>things from tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 11>which is that logos is inherent.</v>

1935
01:59:45.430 --> 01:59:46.263
<v Speaker 11>This isn't something that's been kind of</v>
<v Speaker 11>concocted and positive as some sort of </v>

1936
01:59:51.641 --> 01:59:52.474
<v Speaker 11>philosophical premise.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Wouldn't it be nice if we all kind of </v>

1937
01:59:55.391 --> 01:59:58.930
<v Speaker 11>agreed with this idea and then kind of </v>
<v Speaker 11>move towards it together?</v>

1938
01:59:59.060 --> 02:00:01.210
<v Speaker 11>Even if it was that it would be a good </v>
<v Speaker 11>thing.</v>

1939
02:00:01.990 --> 02:00:03.880
<v Speaker 11>But it's so much more fundamental than </v>
<v Speaker 11>that.</v>

1940
02:00:04.300 --> 02:00:05.133
<v Speaker 11>Every human va,</v>
<v Speaker 11>not just those who adhere to this </v>

1941
02:00:08.261 --> 02:00:09.094
<v Speaker 11>philosophy has the image of God within </v>
<v Speaker 11>them and is he is operating to some </v>

1942
02:00:14.261 --> 02:00:16.720
<v Speaker 11>degree or another according to the </v>
<v Speaker 11>logos.</v>

1943
02:00:16.721 --> 02:00:17.554
<v Speaker 11>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the eastern tradition would tend to </v>

1944
02:00:19.361 --> 02:00:20.194
<v Speaker 11>argue that our very existence is good </v>
<v Speaker 11>and therefore every human being is good </v>

1945
02:00:25.061 --> 02:00:28.150
<v Speaker 11>in so far as they exist.</v>
<v Speaker 11>If there was no goodness in us,</v>

1946
02:00:28.151 --> 02:00:33.151
<v Speaker 11>we would not exist.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Like the evil is eclipsing,</v>

1947
02:00:33.910 --> 02:00:36.520
<v Speaker 11>not uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>actually tangible force,</v>

1948
02:00:36.550 --> 02:00:37.383
<v Speaker 11>not a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And so is it possible for someone </v>

1949
02:00:40.751 --> 02:00:45.751
<v Speaker 11>without Christ to somehow come into </v>
<v Speaker 11>touch deeply with logos within them,</v>

1950
02:00:46.661 --> 02:00:48.910
<v Speaker 11>therefore with Christ?</v>
<v Speaker 11>Um,</v>

1951
02:00:49.690 --> 02:00:50.523
<v Speaker 11>I think the argument would be ultimately</v>
<v Speaker 11>yes at them it was the best means would </v>

1952
02:00:54.701 --> 02:00:55.534
<v Speaker 11>be too,</v>
<v Speaker 11>to hear the Gospel proclaimed Jesus </v>

1953
02:00:58.300 --> 02:01:00.790
<v Speaker 11>Christ is Lord and to respond to that in</v>
<v Speaker 11>faith.</v>

1954
02:01:00.791 --> 02:01:01.481
<v Speaker 11>As you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the,</v>

1955
02:01:01.481 --> 02:01:04.690
<v Speaker 11>the new testament talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but even apart from that,</v>

1956
02:01:04.900 --> 02:01:05.733
<v Speaker 11>everyone already has locals and </v>
<v Speaker 11>therefore everyone already has that </v>

1957
02:01:08.771 --> 02:01:11.530
<v Speaker 11>pattern etched into their very </v>
<v Speaker 11>existence.</v>

1958
02:01:11.890 --> 02:01:12.723
<v Speaker 11>And so that's how we could possibly see </v>
<v Speaker 11>the capacity outside of the sacramental </v>

1959
02:01:18.131 --> 02:01:21.280
<v Speaker 11>boundaries of the church.</v>
<v Speaker 11>People coming to a position of,</v>

1960
02:01:21.530 --> 02:01:22.990
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>harmony would there,</v>

1961
02:01:23.020 --> 02:01:25.540
<v Speaker 11>would there be one of the early church </v>
<v Speaker 11>fathers?</v>

1962
02:01:25.580 --> 02:01:28.610
<v Speaker 11>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>Saint Justin martyr refers to a,</v>

1963
02:01:28.620 --> 02:01:30.790
<v Speaker 11>and it picks up,</v>
<v Speaker 11>actually this is a pre socratic idea.</v>

1964
02:01:30.791 --> 02:01:32.050
<v Speaker 11>The,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the logos,</v>

1965
02:01:32.170 --> 02:01:33.003
<v Speaker 11>spare matticus the seeds of the word </v>
<v Speaker 11>which are all through creation and so </v>

1966
02:01:37.740 --> 02:01:40.640
<v Speaker 11>this is the fundamental essence of,</v>
<v Speaker 11>of all of reality,</v>

1967
02:01:40.641 --> 02:01:41.474
<v Speaker 11>not only in us but in all of creation.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So he was dealing with the fact that </v>

1968
02:01:44.961 --> 02:01:46.070
<v Speaker 11>people were pointing out,</v>
<v Speaker 11>well,</v>

1969
02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:50.270
<v Speaker 11>how come there's dying and rising gods </v>
<v Speaker 11>in all sorts of different cultures?</v>

1970
02:01:50.271 --> 02:01:51.104
<v Speaker 11>How come all of the things that you find</v>
<v Speaker 11>in the the the Christian faith or </v>

1971
02:01:54.481 --> 02:01:57.920
<v Speaker 11>already present in many myths and </v>
<v Speaker 11>cultures and so forth.</v>

1972
02:01:58.130 --> 02:01:59.330
<v Speaker 11>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 11>that's brilliant.</v>

1973
02:01:59.510 --> 02:02:00.500
<v Speaker 11>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>of course they are.</v>

1974
02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:02.930
<v Speaker 11>This is true.</v>
<v Speaker 11>If it wasn't true,</v>

1975
02:02:02.931 --> 02:02:06.560
<v Speaker 11>it wouldn't be so and so in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 11>absolutely.</v>

1976
02:02:06.710 --> 02:02:07.543
<v Speaker 11>What we are trying to do as Orthodox </v>
<v Speaker 11>Christians is simply live in complete </v>

1977
02:02:11.031 --> 02:02:16.031
<v Speaker 11>harmony with who we are as human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 11>This isn't an outside in position.</v>

1978
02:02:16.850 --> 02:02:17.683
<v Speaker 11>This is the very core of what we are.</v>
<v Speaker 11>This is the fulfillment and trajectory </v>

1979
02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:22.183
<v Speaker 11>of creation.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And so that's why it's coming back to </v>

1980
02:02:24.741 --> 02:02:27.350
<v Speaker 11>the earlier point about how can we have </v>
<v Speaker 11>this dialogue,</v>

1981
02:02:27.351 --> 02:02:30.680
<v Speaker 11>this engagement with the world,</v>
<v Speaker 11>with social sciences,</v>

1982
02:02:30.681 --> 02:02:32.300
<v Speaker 11>with physical sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 11>with</v>

1983
02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:34.753
<v Speaker 11>pure physics and mathematics.</v>
<v Speaker 11>We can do that because it all ties in </v>

1984
02:02:38.511 --> 02:02:39.280
<v Speaker 11>any way.</v>
<v Speaker 11>We,</v>

1985
02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:40.113
<v Speaker 11>we are hoping as Orthodox Christians,</v>
<v Speaker 11>we are in touch with what is </v>

1986
02:02:43.191 --> 02:02:46.450
<v Speaker 11>fundamentally true of creation and of </v>
<v Speaker 11>our own human person.</v>

1987
02:02:46.570 --> 02:02:47.403
<v Speaker 11>So,</v>

1988
02:02:48.700 --> 02:02:49.533
<v Speaker 9>okay,</v>

1989
02:02:50.970 --> 02:02:54.640
<v Speaker 6>thank you for that too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1990
02:02:55.050 --> 02:02:58.980
<v Speaker 6>I suppose Dr. Peterson would be best </v>
<v Speaker 6>equipped to handle this,</v>

1991
02:02:59.940 --> 02:03:01.320
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>are or,</v>

1992
02:03:01.470 --> 02:03:06.470
<v Speaker 6>or anyone our union archetypes in accord</v>
<v Speaker 6>with or opposed to Orthodox theology.</v>

1993
02:03:08.250 --> 02:03:09.750
<v Speaker 6>I don't know too much about what that </v>
<v Speaker 6>means,</v>

1994
02:03:09.751 --> 02:03:10.584
<v Speaker 6>but maybe,</v>

1995
02:03:11.470 --> 02:03:12.303
<v Speaker 9>yeah.</v>

1996
02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:18.220
<v Speaker 14>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 14>the problem</v>

1997
02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:19.153
<v Speaker 13>with answering that for me is that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 13>by no means an expert on Orthodox </v>

1998
02:03:22.311 --> 02:03:23.100
<v Speaker 13>theology.</v>

1999
02:03:23.100 --> 02:03:24.690
<v Speaker 14>So,</v>
<v Speaker 14>um,</v>

2000
02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:26.070
<v Speaker 14>but what,</v>

2001
02:03:26.340 --> 02:03:30.090
<v Speaker 13>from what I understand of it,</v>
<v Speaker 13>I would say</v>

2002
02:03:34.710 --> 02:03:38.460
<v Speaker 13>you believe that you was a student of </v>
<v Speaker 13>nature,</v>

2003
02:03:38.480 --> 02:03:39.313
<v Speaker 13>right?</v>
<v Speaker 13>It's something that isn't well known </v>

2004
02:03:41.281 --> 02:03:42.114
<v Speaker 13>about you because most of the history of</v>
<v Speaker 13>psychoanalytic thought was written by </v>

2005
02:03:45.931 --> 02:03:49.110
<v Speaker 13>the Friday ends and they think of you as</v>
<v Speaker 13>a student of Freud.</v>

2006
02:03:49.111 --> 02:03:49.944
<v Speaker 13>And of course that's true human was </v>
<v Speaker 13>really introduced to the idea of a </v>

2007
02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:54.513
<v Speaker 13>profound idea of the unconscious through</v>
<v Speaker 13>Freud and also at least in part to the </v>

2008
02:03:59.431 --> 02:04:02.610
<v Speaker 13>idea that there was an interior world of</v>
<v Speaker 13>symbols.</v>

2009
02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:06.900
<v Speaker 13>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 13>human was a student of nature.</v>

2010
02:04:06.901 --> 02:04:07.734
<v Speaker 13>And you see nature announced the death </v>
<v Speaker 13>of God in the late 19 hundreds and what </v>

2011
02:04:13.591 --> 02:04:14.424
<v Speaker 13>he meant by that in some sense was that </v>
<v Speaker 13>he meant that the spirit of trees that </v>

2012
02:04:19.561 --> 02:04:23.040
<v Speaker 13>had been instantiated by Christianity </v>
<v Speaker 13>had turned against the,</v>

2013
02:04:23.460 --> 02:04:26.190
<v Speaker 13>the Dogma of Christianity and destroyed </v>
<v Speaker 13>it.</v>

2014
02:04:26.580 --> 02:04:29.190
<v Speaker 13>And what he meant by that was that the </v>
<v Speaker 13>emerging,</v>

2015
02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:31.673
<v Speaker 13>the emergence of science in that context</v>
<v Speaker 13>of Western culture and the elaborate </v>

2016
02:04:37.471 --> 02:04:38.304
<v Speaker 13>description of physical reality that he </v>
<v Speaker 13>that was developed as a consequence </v>

2017
02:04:42.030 --> 02:04:45.250
<v Speaker 13>ended up in apparent contradiction with </v>
<v Speaker 13>the Teresa,</v>

2018
02:04:45.390 --> 02:04:48.360
<v Speaker 13>with the truths of,</v>
<v Speaker 13>of our religious tradition.</v>

2019
02:04:48.810 --> 02:04:52.800
<v Speaker 13>And we pick the most developed truth and</v>
<v Speaker 13>let the other one go.</v>

2020
02:04:53.670 --> 02:04:58.670
<v Speaker 13>And nature was not celebrating that </v>
<v Speaker 13>contrary to what most people think.</v>

2021
02:04:59.510 --> 02:05:02.010
<v Speaker 13>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 13>when he spoke of the death of God,</v>

2022
02:05:02.011 --> 02:05:05.510
<v Speaker 13>he said that it was an absolute </v>
<v Speaker 13>catastrophe and that would,</v>

2023
02:05:05.550 --> 02:05:08.040
<v Speaker 13>we would pay for it with millions of </v>
<v Speaker 13>lives.</v>

2024
02:05:08.550 --> 02:05:11.520
<v Speaker 13>And that was his prognostication for the</v>
<v Speaker 13>20th century,</v>

2025
02:05:11.521 --> 02:05:12.354
<v Speaker 13>which happened to come true in precisely</v>
<v Speaker 13>the manner he indicated for exactly the </v>

2026
02:05:15.541 --> 02:05:20.541
<v Speaker 13>reasons nature believe that we would </v>
<v Speaker 13>have to invent our own values because we</v>

2027
02:05:20.881 --> 02:05:23.850
<v Speaker 13>had become,</v>
<v Speaker 13>because the old values that we had lived</v>

2028
02:05:23.851 --> 02:05:28.851
<v Speaker 13>by had had bled themselves out and die.</v>
<v Speaker 13>But the problem with that,</v>

2029
02:05:29.101 --> 02:05:29.934
<v Speaker 13>and this is something you picked up on,</v>
<v Speaker 13>the problem with that is that you can't </v>

2030
02:05:32.521 --> 02:05:33.354
<v Speaker 13>invent your own values.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And you know that because all of you </v>

2031
02:05:35.941 --> 02:05:39.960
<v Speaker 13>have tried on New Year's Day to decide </v>
<v Speaker 13>that you're going to eat less than go to</v>

2032
02:05:39.961 --> 02:05:40.560
<v Speaker 13>the gym.</v>

2033
02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:43.020
<v Speaker 13>And you'd think if you could create your</v>
<v Speaker 13>own values,</v>

2034
02:05:43.021 --> 02:05:44.970
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 13>being this sort of Demi God,</v>

2035
02:05:44.971 --> 02:05:45.804
<v Speaker 13>that as soon as you told yourself that </v>
<v Speaker 13>you would eat properly and go to the </v>

2036
02:05:48.241 --> 02:05:50.190
<v Speaker 13>gym,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you'd be up at six in the morning,</v>

2037
02:05:50.400 --> 02:05:51.233
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 13>eating carrots and Rutabagas and then </v>

2038
02:05:53.520 --> 02:05:56.070
<v Speaker 13>going off to lift heavy weights.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And of course you're not,</v>

2039
02:05:56.071 --> 02:06:00.720
<v Speaker 13>you're sitting in your chair at night </v>
<v Speaker 13>eating cheetos and watching,</v>

2040
02:06:01.140 --> 02:06:03.240
<v Speaker 13>watching pornography,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

2041
02:06:04.590 --> 02:06:09.540
<v Speaker 13>so how in the world is something like </v>
<v Speaker 13>that supposed to create its own values?</v>

2042
02:06:09.541 --> 02:06:10.374
<v Speaker 13>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you're not in control of yourself to </v>

2043
02:06:11.371 --> 02:06:12.204
<v Speaker 13>that degree.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And so yones answer to that problem was </v>

2044
02:06:15.301 --> 02:06:16.700
<v Speaker 13>to,</v>
<v Speaker 13>was essentially to,</v>

2045
02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:20.370
<v Speaker 13>to look partly within and partly to look</v>
<v Speaker 13>in the symbolic domain.</v>

2046
02:06:20.371 --> 02:06:25.371
<v Speaker 13>And what he realized as a consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 13>doing that was that there was a profound</v>

2047
02:06:26.250 --> 02:06:28.920
<v Speaker 13>answer to the question of the </v>
<v Speaker 13>resurrection of value.</v>

2048
02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:33.920
<v Speaker 13>And for him that was really the </v>
<v Speaker 13>embodiment of the pattern of,</v>

2049
02:06:35.610 --> 02:06:36.443
<v Speaker 13>of Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 13>That was the self as far as [inaudible] </v>

2050
02:06:38.040 --> 02:06:40.880
<v Speaker 13>was concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 13>there was no difference between the,</v>

2051
02:06:40.910 --> 02:06:44.460
<v Speaker 13>the architect will self and the symbolic</v>
<v Speaker 13>Christ.</v>

2052
02:06:44.461 --> 02:06:47.910
<v Speaker 13>They were the same thing as far as </v>
<v Speaker 13>anyone was concerned in so far as Christ</v>

2053
02:06:47.911 --> 02:06:50.970
<v Speaker 13>is the vision of the perfect man,</v>
<v Speaker 13>right?</v>

2054
02:06:50.971 --> 02:06:53.160
<v Speaker 13>Which is a symbolic vision.</v>
<v Speaker 13>So you could say,</v>

2055
02:06:53.161 --> 02:06:53.994
<v Speaker 13>well what is Christ?</v>
<v Speaker 13>And the answer to that is while Christ </v>

2056
02:06:56.071 --> 02:06:58.500
<v Speaker 13>is whatever you think of as the perfect </v>
<v Speaker 13>man,</v>

2057
02:06:58.860 --> 02:07:01.620
<v Speaker 13>now you're going to have diverse </v>
<v Speaker 13>representations of that.</v>

2058
02:07:01.621 --> 02:07:02.454
<v Speaker 13>So you could think about it Christ as </v>
<v Speaker 13>the totality of the visions of the </v>

2059
02:07:05.371 --> 02:07:07.170
<v Speaker 13>perfect man.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It's something like that.</v>

2060
02:07:07.470 --> 02:07:11.790
<v Speaker 13>And then that the goal of life was to </v>
<v Speaker 13>embody that as deeply as possible.</v>

2061
02:07:12.150 --> 02:07:17.150
<v Speaker 13>And you can also believed that the world</v>
<v Speaker 13>would transform itself around you to the</v>

2062
02:07:18.001 --> 02:07:19.920
<v Speaker 13>degree that you did that to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 13>to,</v>

2063
02:07:19.921 --> 02:07:23.430
<v Speaker 13>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 13>to an unspecified double degree.</v>

2064
02:07:23.940 --> 02:07:28.260
<v Speaker 13>And that's where the symbolic reality </v>
<v Speaker 13>and the historical reality unite</v>

2065
02:07:30.030 --> 02:07:32.100
<v Speaker 13>because,</v>
<v Speaker 13>and we know it's true.</v>

2066
02:07:32.101 --> 02:07:35.050
<v Speaker 13>We also know this is true.</v>
<v Speaker 13>If you look at people like Gandhi or you</v>

2067
02:07:35.051 --> 02:07:37.420
<v Speaker 13>look at people like saussure knits and </v>
<v Speaker 13>for example,</v>

2068
02:07:37.630 --> 02:07:41.050
<v Speaker 13>these are great people who stood up as </v>
<v Speaker 13>moral icons,</v>

2069
02:07:41.051 --> 02:07:43.090
<v Speaker 13>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 13>in the midst of absolute chaos.</v>

2070
02:07:43.091 --> 02:07:46.090
<v Speaker 13>And they transform entire civilizations </v>
<v Speaker 13>by doing that,</v>

2071
02:07:46.091 --> 02:07:48.760
<v Speaker 13>by standing up for what they believe to </v>
<v Speaker 13>be true.</v>

2072
02:07:48.940 --> 02:07:51.130
<v Speaker 13>They transformed the entire world around</v>
<v Speaker 13>them.</v>

2073
02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:53.740
<v Speaker 13>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 13>they're only partially perfect.</v>

2074
02:07:53.741 --> 02:07:56.050
<v Speaker 13>Someone like Solzhenitsyn or someone </v>
<v Speaker 13>like Gandhi or,</v>

2075
02:07:56.260 --> 02:07:57.093
<v Speaker 13>or perhaps someone like Nelson Mandela,</v>
<v Speaker 13>there only partial incarnations of </v>

2076
02:08:00.551 --> 02:08:01.384
<v Speaker 13>perfection,</v>
<v Speaker 13>but even to the degree that they were </v>

2077
02:08:03.941 --> 02:08:04.774
<v Speaker 13>flawed,</v>
<v Speaker 13>know they were perfectly enough so that </v>

2078
02:08:06.971 --> 02:08:07.804
<v Speaker 13>despite their remnant flaws,</v>
<v Speaker 13>they were able to reorganize the thing </v>

2079
02:08:10.871 --> 02:08:11.704
<v Speaker 13>itself around them.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And we don't know what the ultimate </v>

2080
02:08:13.510 --> 02:08:14.620
<v Speaker 13>limit of that is.</v>

2081
02:08:14.620 --> 02:08:15.453
<v Speaker 13>We really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It could be that everything will align </v>

2082
02:08:18.101 --> 02:08:18.934
<v Speaker 13>itself around people to the degree that </v>
<v Speaker 13>they put themselves together and I </v>

2083
02:08:21.491 --> 02:08:22.324
<v Speaker 13>actually have,</v>
<v Speaker 13>I've had experiences that make me </v>

2084
02:08:23.711 --> 02:08:25.340
<v Speaker 13>convinced that that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 13>I,</v>

2085
02:08:25.341 --> 02:08:28.390
<v Speaker 13>I truly believe that that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 13>So,</v>

2086
02:08:28.630 --> 02:08:29.463
<v Speaker 13>and that's also what gives me some,</v>
<v Speaker 13>some belief in these strange Christian </v>

2087
02:08:32.081 --> 02:08:35.200
<v Speaker 13>ideas about the harrowing of Hell and </v>
<v Speaker 13>the overcoming of death.</v>

2088
02:08:35.230 --> 02:08:36.063
<v Speaker 13>It's like we have no idea what we could </v>
<v Speaker 13>do as individual embodiments of the </v>

2089
02:08:41.081 --> 02:08:41.914
<v Speaker 13>logos,</v>
<v Speaker 13>which is clearly what we are because </v>

2090
02:08:43.061 --> 02:08:43.894
<v Speaker 13>we're all conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 13>We have no idea what obstacles we could </v>

2091
02:08:45.941 --> 02:08:46.774
<v Speaker 13>overcome and what,</v>
<v Speaker 13>what massive transformations we could </v>

2092
02:08:49.601 --> 02:08:52.360
<v Speaker 13>undertake if we actually lived our lives</v>
<v Speaker 13>properly.</v>

2093
02:08:52.540 --> 02:08:55.810
<v Speaker 13>God only knows what we could get rid of.</v>
<v Speaker 13>We could get rid of malaria,</v>

2094
02:08:55.840 --> 02:08:58.570
<v Speaker 13>we could get rid of schistosomiasis and </v>
<v Speaker 13>the Guinea worm.</v>

2095
02:08:58.571 --> 02:08:59.680
<v Speaker 13>Those are going to be gone soon.</v>

2096
02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:01.000
<v Speaker 13>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 13>polio,</v>

2097
02:09:01.360 --> 02:09:04.330
<v Speaker 13>we're going to get rid of hunger.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Maybe we can get rid of death.</v>

2098
02:09:05.170 --> 02:09:07.570
<v Speaker 13>Maybe we can get rid of hell.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Who knows?</v>

2099
02:09:07.870 --> 02:09:08.703
<v Speaker 13>And I know I'm certainly someone who </v>
<v Speaker 13>believes that hell is real because I've </v>

2100
02:09:10.961 --> 02:09:11.794
<v Speaker 13>read enough of the accounts of what </v>
<v Speaker 13>happened in the 20th century to know </v>

2101
02:09:13.961 --> 02:09:18.550
<v Speaker 13>precisely that it's as real as the most </v>
<v Speaker 13>warped imagination can possibly make it.</v>

2102
02:09:18.551 --> 02:09:22.210
<v Speaker 13>And that's plenty real enough for me.</v>
<v Speaker 13>So</v>

2103
02:09:23.740 --> 02:09:24.573
<v Speaker 13>well,</v>
<v Speaker 13>so I would say humans vision is very </v>

2104
02:09:26.111 --> 02:09:26.944
<v Speaker 13>much in keeping as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 13>understand with the central traditions </v>

2105
02:09:29.621 --> 02:09:30.454
<v Speaker 13>of the Orthodox Church,</v>
<v Speaker 13>because he believed that it was the </v>

2106
02:09:32.321 --> 02:09:33.154
<v Speaker 13>highest moral duty of the,</v>
<v Speaker 13>of the awake soul to participate in </v>

2107
02:09:37.961 --> 02:09:40.450
<v Speaker 13>manifestation of the self.</v>
<v Speaker 13>That's,</v>

2108
02:09:40.780 --> 02:09:43.570
<v Speaker 13>and that's this union of things that the</v>
<v Speaker 13>Jonathan talked about.</v>

2109
02:09:43.571 --> 02:09:44.980
<v Speaker 13>That's beyond duality.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It's,</v>

2110
02:09:45.190 --> 02:09:46.023
<v Speaker 13>it's to bring everything in you together</v>
<v Speaker 13>into this kind of harmony that then </v>

2111
02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:54.550
<v Speaker 13>extends beyond you into your family and,</v>
<v Speaker 13>and pass that it's musical.</v>

2112
02:09:54.551 --> 02:09:55.384
<v Speaker 13>That's what music represents.</v>
<v Speaker 13>That's why we find it so intensely </v>

2113
02:09:57.791 --> 02:09:59.860
<v Speaker 13>meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 13>That's what music tells us.</v>

2114
02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:01.360
<v Speaker 13>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 13>it's a,</v>

2115
02:10:01.660 --> 02:10:05.330
<v Speaker 13>it's an artwork based upon the meaning </v>
<v Speaker 13>of pattern and it,</v>

2116
02:10:05.370 --> 02:10:06.203
<v Speaker 13>and it infuses everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 13>You know what it's like to listen to </v>

2117
02:10:07.871 --> 02:10:08.704
<v Speaker 13>music.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Even the darkest punk rocking our </v>

2118
02:10:11.581 --> 02:10:12.414
<v Speaker 13>anarchist atheist is overwhelmed with </v>
<v Speaker 13>the glory of God when he listens to his </v>

2119
02:10:16.481 --> 02:10:19.450
<v Speaker 13>punk rock music.</v>
<v Speaker 13>So yeah.</v>

2120
02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:24.633
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2121
02:10:25.490 --> 02:10:27.590
<v Speaker 13>Just a quick comment on that.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Um,</v>

2122
02:10:27.770 --> 02:10:30.260
<v Speaker 13>going back to the central part of that </v>
<v Speaker 13>question,</v>

2123
02:10:30.261 --> 02:10:32.600
<v Speaker 13>which is about archetypes and with her </v>
<v Speaker 13>they're the same,</v>

2124
02:10:32.870 --> 02:10:33.770
<v Speaker 13>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 13>I would</v>

2125
02:10:34.430 --> 02:10:36.720
<v Speaker 11>largely agree with that point.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Uh,</v>

2126
02:10:36.760 --> 02:10:40.790
<v Speaker 11>to the extent to which anyone is in </v>
<v Speaker 11>touch with the logos within them,</v>

2127
02:10:40.820 --> 02:10:41.653
<v Speaker 11>they are going to be in touch with </v>
<v Speaker 11>fundamental archetypes and those would </v>

2128
02:10:43.761 --> 02:10:48.500
<v Speaker 11>be the same at the church.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Fathers refer us to and and so forth.</v>

2129
02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:51.590
<v Speaker 11>The one element that,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and it's kind of relates to the previous</v>

2130
02:10:51.591 --> 02:10:53.480
<v Speaker 11>question about can you do this without </v>
<v Speaker 11>Christ?</v>

2131
02:10:53.870 --> 02:10:58.870
<v Speaker 11>The thing which is the possibly the </v>
<v Speaker 11>unique elements of Christian faith,</v>

2132
02:11:00.490 --> 02:11:02.570
<v Speaker 11>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it's not love.</v>

2133
02:11:03.650 --> 02:11:06.290
<v Speaker 11>Love is what defines Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 11>In fact,</v>

2134
02:11:06.291 --> 02:11:07.124
<v Speaker 11>love can be found throughout the world.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's more hope and what I know about </v>

2135
02:11:11.931 --> 02:11:14.600
<v Speaker 11>young,</v>
<v Speaker 11>which isn't all that much,</v>

2136
02:11:14.660 --> 02:11:18.950
<v Speaker 11>but absolutely the archetypes are there.</v>
<v Speaker 11>We'll go with that.</v>

2137
02:11:19.880 --> 02:11:24.500
<v Speaker 11>Does he come with the same level of hope</v>
<v Speaker 11>that we would as authors?</v>

2138
02:11:24.501 --> 02:11:25.251
<v Speaker 11>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I mean,</v>

2139
02:11:25.251 --> 02:11:28.430
<v Speaker 11>sometimes you wonder whether the Coteau </v>
<v Speaker 11>Vasquez,</v>

2140
02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:33.640
<v Speaker 11>the descent kind of leads us to a hell </v>
<v Speaker 11>where we inhabit without hope and rather</v>

2141
02:11:35.421 --> 02:11:35.960
<v Speaker 11>with despair.</v>

2142
02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:38.470
<v Speaker 11>Can we back to that point about a </v>
<v Speaker 11>archimandrites software?</v>

2143
02:11:38.471 --> 02:11:42.620
<v Speaker 11>Knee puts your mind in hell,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but don't despair.</v>

2144
02:11:42.660 --> 02:11:43.493
<v Speaker 11>Another was have hope.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So is it possible to have that hope </v>

2145
02:11:46.220 --> 02:11:47.053
<v Speaker 11>without ultimately what we have,</v>
<v Speaker 11>which is the cross and the message of </v>

2146
02:11:50.001 --> 02:11:50.834
<v Speaker 11>the cross as an archetype is that we </v>
<v Speaker 11>stare into the depths of darkness and </v>

2147
02:11:58.581 --> 02:12:03.230
<v Speaker 11>death and we proclaim light in life.</v>
<v Speaker 11>In fact,</v>

2148
02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:05.073
<v Speaker 11>you know that's what Jesus himself says </v>
<v Speaker 11>when he refers us back to the old </v>

2149
02:12:07.941 --> 02:12:11.210
<v Speaker 11>testament to when the people of Israel </v>
<v Speaker 11>were dying in the wilderness,</v>

2150
02:12:11.240 --> 02:12:14.680
<v Speaker 11>having come out with Moses and they're </v>
<v Speaker 11>grumbling because they said we,</v>

2151
02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:17.410
<v Speaker 11>if only we were back in Egypt where we </v>
<v Speaker 11>had it so good.</v>

2152
02:12:17.411 --> 02:12:19.280
<v Speaker 11>Of course the reality of Egypt was </v>
<v Speaker 11>slavery,</v>

2153
02:12:19.730 --> 02:12:20.630
<v Speaker 11>but they thought,</v>
<v Speaker 11>no,</v>

2154
02:12:20.631 --> 02:12:21.464
<v Speaker 11>no,</v>
<v Speaker 11>we're just going to grumble and they're </v>

2155
02:12:23.301 --> 02:12:27.110
<v Speaker 11>afflicted by serpents and the in God </v>
<v Speaker 11>says this most incredible thing.</v>

2156
02:12:27.290 --> 02:12:28.123
<v Speaker 11>Put a serpent on a stick and hold it up.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And those people that look at the </v>

2157
02:12:32.571 --> 02:12:37.310
<v Speaker 11>serpent look at the source of the </v>
<v Speaker 11>suffering and death will be healed.</v>

2158
02:12:37.730 --> 02:12:39.530
<v Speaker 11>And so Christ says,</v>
<v Speaker 11>Jesus says,</v>

2159
02:12:39.800 --> 02:12:40.633
<v Speaker 11>the son of man will be raised up.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So we have to look upon death and </v>

2160
02:12:44.511 --> 02:12:48.050
<v Speaker 11>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 11>We have to descend into hell with light,</v>

2161
02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:51.550
<v Speaker 11>with light,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the light that it is never extinguished.</v>

2162
02:12:51.600 --> 02:12:52.433
<v Speaker 11>Come back to the prologue of Saint John.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I don't know whether that's there and </v>

2163
02:12:54.791 --> 02:12:58.430
<v Speaker 11>younger and I can be corrected on that,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but that's possibly the point where,</v>

2164
02:12:58.910 --> 02:12:59.411
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>a,</v>

2165
02:12:59.411 --> 02:13:00.244
<v Speaker 11>a purely social science or psychological</v>
<v Speaker 11>approach might be lacking because I see </v>

2166
02:13:05.121 --> 02:13:08.860
<v Speaker 11>the Christian virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 11>Alex Sinners is hope because it's,</v>

2167
02:13:08.861 --> 02:13:13.861
<v Speaker 11>it's almost unique in its capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 11>look into everything that is so dark and</v>

2168
02:13:14.661 --> 02:13:17.870
<v Speaker 11>say there is yet life.</v>
<v Speaker 11>There is yet late.</v>

2169
02:13:23.490 --> 02:13:27.450
<v Speaker 11>So one of the things that really </v>
<v Speaker 11>affected young,</v>

2170
02:13:27.480 --> 02:13:30.990
<v Speaker 11>who by the way worked for the American </v>
<v Speaker 11>government,</v>

2171
02:13:31.110 --> 02:13:32.070
<v Speaker 11>the CIA during</v>

2172
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:33.380
<v Speaker 13>World War Two,</v>
<v Speaker 13>um,</v>

2173
02:13:33.750 --> 02:13:36.270
<v Speaker 13>sending them psychological reports on </v>
<v Speaker 13>Hitler,</v>

2174
02:13:36.800 --> 02:13:37.633
<v Speaker 13>um,</v>
<v Speaker 13>young meditated for a very long period </v>

2175
02:13:41.311 --> 02:13:42.144
<v Speaker 13>of time on what happened in Nazi Germany</v>
<v Speaker 13>and young's the dictum that he derived </v>

2176
02:13:47.551 --> 02:13:50.730
<v Speaker 13>from his l chemical studies was in </v>
<v Speaker 13>[inaudible] tour,</v>

2177
02:13:50.731 --> 02:13:51.564
<v Speaker 13>which I'm probably saying wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 13>but it means the thing you want most </v>

2178
02:13:53.851 --> 02:13:57.270
<v Speaker 13>will be will be found the place you at </v>
<v Speaker 13>least one look.</v>

2179
02:13:58.080 --> 02:14:00.930
<v Speaker 13>And so for young you,</v>
<v Speaker 13>cause one of the questions you might ask</v>

2180
02:14:00.931 --> 02:14:03.180
<v Speaker 13>yourself is that if enlightenment is </v>
<v Speaker 13>possible,</v>

2181
02:14:03.181 --> 02:14:05.430
<v Speaker 13>let's say if union with the self as </v>
<v Speaker 13>possible,</v>

2182
02:14:05.431 --> 02:14:07.410
<v Speaker 13>there's some sort of mystical </v>
<v Speaker 13>transcendence.</v>

2183
02:14:07.740 --> 02:14:09.930
<v Speaker 13>Why in the world aren't we just all that</v>
<v Speaker 13>way?</v>

2184
02:14:09.980 --> 02:14:11.670
<v Speaker 13>What's the barrier?</v>
<v Speaker 13>It's like,</v>

2185
02:14:11.671 --> 02:14:13.050
<v Speaker 13>well,</v>
<v Speaker 13>we could be way better.</v>

2186
02:14:13.830 --> 02:14:18.420
<v Speaker 13>Well why not just do it then if it's </v>
<v Speaker 13>just right there ahead of us.</v>

2187
02:14:18.421 --> 02:14:19.254
<v Speaker 13>But,</v>
<v Speaker 13>but the answer to that is I think is </v>

2188
02:14:22.650 --> 02:14:23.483
<v Speaker 13>something like you cannot conceive of </v>
<v Speaker 13>how good a human being might be until </v>

2189
02:14:27.751 --> 02:14:31.830
<v Speaker 13>you can conceive of how evil a human </v>
<v Speaker 13>being can and will be.</v>

2190
02:14:32.220 --> 02:14:36.360
<v Speaker 13>And that means to encounter in yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 13>the Nazi that the prison guard,</v>

2191
02:14:36.361 --> 02:14:37.194
<v Speaker 13>the Auschwitz Guard to understand fully </v>
<v Speaker 13>that there is no difference between you </v>

2192
02:14:42.900 --> 02:14:47.550
<v Speaker 13>and the people who were killing children</v>
<v Speaker 13>in the Nazi death camps that you,</v>

2193
02:14:48.360 --> 02:14:49.193
<v Speaker 13>and that's that encounter with hell.</v>
<v Speaker 13>That's literally that encounter with </v>

2194
02:14:51.781 --> 02:14:53.560
<v Speaker 13>hell.</v>
<v Speaker 13>You're a dentist and of hell.</v>

2195
02:14:53.570 --> 02:14:54.403
<v Speaker 13>Insofar as you're capable of that and </v>
<v Speaker 13>you are capable of that and there isn't </v>

2196
02:14:57.871 --> 02:15:00.930
<v Speaker 13>anything I think that can scare you </v>
<v Speaker 13>straight,</v>

2197
02:15:02.250 --> 02:15:03.083
<v Speaker 13>except that knowledge you can be,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you can be and are a vessel that can be </v>

2198
02:15:07.951 --> 02:15:11.580
<v Speaker 13>used for absolute evil and you would </v>
<v Speaker 13>participate in it,</v>

2199
02:15:11.581 --> 02:15:15.390
<v Speaker 13>you would participate in it.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And so for young,</v>

2200
02:15:15.391 --> 02:15:17.790
<v Speaker 13>the pathway to,</v>
<v Speaker 13>it's like Dante,</v>

2201
02:15:17.791 --> 02:15:21.360
<v Speaker 13>you don't get to paradise before you go </v>
<v Speaker 13>to the lowest levels of hell.</v>

2202
02:15:21.361 --> 02:15:21.841
<v Speaker 13>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 13>Right.</v>

2203
02:15:21.841 --> 02:15:24.840
<v Speaker 13>At the bottom where betrayal lurks for </v>
<v Speaker 13>Dante,</v>

2204
02:15:24.841 --> 02:15:26.460
<v Speaker 13>that was the worst of all sins.</v>

2205
02:15:26.970 --> 02:15:27.803
<v Speaker 13>And so it's a terrifying process.</v>
<v Speaker 13>I tried to teach my students in my maps </v>

2206
02:15:32.161 --> 02:15:32.994
<v Speaker 13>of meaning class,</v>
<v Speaker 13>which is the opposite of the safe space </v>

2207
02:15:34.741 --> 02:15:35.910
<v Speaker 13>as far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 13>I,</v>

2208
02:15:36.210 --> 02:15:37.680
<v Speaker 13>I,</v>
<v Speaker 13>and I mean that technically,</v>

2209
02:15:37.681 --> 02:15:40.410
<v Speaker 13>I truly do mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 13>I tried to convince my students,</v>

2210
02:15:40.411 --> 02:15:45.411
<v Speaker 13>I try to get them to meditate on the </v>
<v Speaker 13>fact that they're that Damn Nazis.</v>

2211
02:15:46.230 --> 02:15:48.540
<v Speaker 13>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 13>Because what is it?</v>

2212
02:15:48.541 --> 02:15:49.410
<v Speaker 13>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 13>what is it?</v>

2213
02:15:49.411 --> 02:15:51.540
<v Speaker 13>The Germans like come on.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Really?</v>

2214
02:15:51.660 --> 02:15:54.510
<v Speaker 13>No,</v>
<v Speaker 13>obviously not.</v>

2215
02:15:54.870 --> 02:15:55.703
<v Speaker 13>It's people.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And so the pathway to paradise is </v>

2216
02:15:58.471 --> 02:16:01.860
<v Speaker 13>through hell and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 13>it's no wonder no one goes there.</v>

2217
02:16:01.861 --> 02:16:03.780
<v Speaker 13>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 13>who wants to go there?</v>

2218
02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:05.730
<v Speaker 13>No one.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Well,</v>

2219
02:16:05.790 --> 02:16:09.810
<v Speaker 13>if you don't go there voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you'll go there accidentally.</v>

2220
02:16:10.260 --> 02:16:13.800
<v Speaker 13>So it's better to go there voluntarily </v>
<v Speaker 13>because then you can go with hope.</v>

2221
02:16:13.801 --> 02:16:15.270
<v Speaker 13>You can say,</v>
<v Speaker 13>I can withstand this.</v>

2222
02:16:15.271 --> 02:16:17.370
<v Speaker 13>Maybe I can find a light at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 13>the tunnel.</v>

2223
02:16:24.860 --> 02:16:27.260
<v Speaker 13>A question for Mr Pojo.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Uh,</v>

2224
02:16:27.261 --> 02:16:30.130
<v Speaker 13>you have spoken in the past about the </v>
<v Speaker 13>contradictory</v>

2225
02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:32.080
<v Speaker 1>nature of symbols.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

2226
02:16:32.081 --> 02:16:35.710
<v Speaker 1>water represents both healing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous chaos.</v>

2227
02:16:36.130 --> 02:16:36.963
<v Speaker 1>Can you speak about how we can resolve </v>
<v Speaker 1>this apparent contradiction and to </v>

2228
02:16:40.061 --> 02:16:40.894
<v Speaker 1>follow up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does this apply to the relationship </v>

2229
02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:47.440
<v Speaker 1>between the internal mental world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the external material world?</v>

2230
02:16:52.540 --> 02:16:53.373
<v Speaker 10>You might have to repeat the second part</v>
<v Speaker 10>of that question after I answer the </v>

2231
02:16:55.361 --> 02:16:56.780
<v Speaker 10>first part.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

2232
02:16:58.870 --> 02:17:00.370
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I think,</v>

2233
02:17:01.180 --> 02:17:01.521
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I,</v>

2234
02:17:01.521 --> 02:17:03.260
<v Speaker 10>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 10>one of the things that has,</v>

2235
02:17:03.310 --> 02:17:04.143
<v Speaker 10>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that I've been thinking a lot about is </v>

2236
02:17:05.741 --> 02:17:07.750
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>is the duality of symbols.</v>

2237
02:17:08.210 --> 02:17:10.210
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>every,</v>

2238
02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:14.340
<v Speaker 10>every image,</v>
<v Speaker 10>every symbol has like a dark and a light</v>

2239
02:17:14.410 --> 02:17:15.243
<v Speaker 10>light side.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And you can see it when you read the </v>

2240
02:17:16.151 --> 02:17:16.984
<v Speaker 10>Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 10>when you read the stories or even when </v>

2241
02:17:19.991 --> 02:17:22.690
<v Speaker 10>you look at icons or when you look at </v>
<v Speaker 10>images and,</v>

2242
02:17:22.691 --> 02:17:23.524
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

2243
02:17:24.060 --> 02:17:24.893
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2244
02:17:25.080 --> 02:17:25.913
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

2245
02:17:26.540 --> 02:17:27.620
<v Speaker 10>it has to do with,</v>
<v Speaker 10>with,</v>

2246
02:17:27.621 --> 02:17:28.454
<v Speaker 10>with this idea of a,</v>
<v Speaker 10>of a cent or this idea of moving up </v>

2247
02:17:32.780 --> 02:17:34.030
<v Speaker 10>because,</v>
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

2248
02:17:35.930 --> 02:17:36.763
<v Speaker 10>what's important when we're in on the </v>
<v Speaker 10>spiritual journey is the direction that </v>

2249
02:17:40.521 --> 02:17:42.190
<v Speaker 10>we're facing.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's at,</v>

2250
02:17:42.290 --> 02:17:43.123
<v Speaker 10>it's not so much where we are.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Like if you can imagine the ascent of </v>

2251
02:17:47.241 --> 02:17:50.660
<v Speaker 10>the world or of ourselves up to God as a</v>
<v Speaker 10>ladder,</v>

2252
02:17:50.840 --> 02:17:53.000
<v Speaker 10>which is how often it's represented in,</v>
<v Speaker 10>in,</v>

2253
02:17:53.001 --> 02:17:56.840
<v Speaker 10>in Orthodox icons as this ladder that we</v>
<v Speaker 10>ascend towards God.</v>

2254
02:17:57.050 --> 02:18:00.350
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you could be pretty high up the ladder,</v>

2255
02:18:00.351 --> 02:18:03.380
<v Speaker 10>but if you fall,</v>
<v Speaker 10>there's no point,</v>

2256
02:18:03.470 --> 02:18:05.420
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>
<v Speaker 10>The idea is to ascend.</v>

2257
02:18:05.421 --> 02:18:08.780
<v Speaker 10>And so all of the symbols that we see in</v>
<v Speaker 10>m</v>

2258
02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:13.660
<v Speaker 10>in the Bible have those two sides.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And water is a,</v>

2259
02:18:13.661 --> 02:18:15.850
<v Speaker 10>is a perfect example in the old </v>
<v Speaker 10>testament,</v>

2260
02:18:16.030 --> 02:18:16.863
<v Speaker 10>all through the old tests,</v>
<v Speaker 10>old testament water is an image of </v>

2261
02:18:19.331 --> 02:18:20.700
<v Speaker 10>death,</v>
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

2262
02:18:21.020 --> 02:18:22.870
<v Speaker 10>in the flood.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

2263
02:18:23.110 --> 02:18:26.470
<v Speaker 10>and then the crossing of the Red Sea </v>
<v Speaker 10>crossing of the Jordan,</v>

2264
02:18:26.620 --> 02:18:29.050
<v Speaker 10>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 10>he's constantly this symbol of death.</v>

2265
02:18:29.350 --> 02:18:34.350
<v Speaker 10>But the key to resolving the a duality </v>
<v Speaker 10>of symbolism is Christ.</v>

2266
02:18:38.020 --> 02:18:41.380
<v Speaker 10>He is always the key to all the stories </v>
<v Speaker 10>I believe.</v>

2267
02:18:41.920 --> 02:18:42.753
<v Speaker 10>And so when you look at the story of </v>
<v Speaker 10>Christ and you see how he takes let's </v>

2268
02:18:47.561 --> 02:18:48.394
<v Speaker 10>say,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the dark side of a symbol and he flips </v>

2269
02:18:50.201 --> 02:18:52.930
<v Speaker 10>it over and then makes it into something</v>
<v Speaker 10>else.</v>

2270
02:18:53.080 --> 02:18:55.180
<v Speaker 10>So that's the mystery,</v>
<v Speaker 10>let's say,</v>

2271
02:18:55.420 --> 02:18:57.040
<v Speaker 10>of baptism.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

2272
02:18:57.160 --> 02:18:59.830
<v Speaker 10>why,</v>
<v Speaker 10>why would we have to be baptized?</v>

2273
02:18:59.831 --> 02:19:02.470
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's a very strange that this flood,</v>

2274
02:19:02.740 --> 02:19:03.573
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>this Red Sea that the Egyptians were </v>

2275
02:19:05.411 --> 02:19:07.570
<v Speaker 10>drowned in.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Why would we have to be baptized?</v>

2276
02:19:07.570 --> 02:19:11.440
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's because the Christ takes this death</v>

2277
02:19:11.620 --> 02:19:12.453
<v Speaker 10>and changes into,</v>
<v Speaker 10>he changes it into a process of let's </v>

2278
02:19:15.191 --> 02:19:18.760
<v Speaker 10>say washing or a process of </v>
<v Speaker 10>purification.</v>

2279
02:19:19.570 --> 02:19:21.190
<v Speaker 10>And so the same symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 10>which is,</v>

2280
02:19:21.220 --> 02:19:23.440
<v Speaker 10>which is death,</v>
<v Speaker 10>can also be a symbol of washing.</v>

2281
02:19:23.850 --> 02:19:25.350
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so,</v>

2282
02:19:25.351 --> 02:19:26.890
<v Speaker 10>so,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so it's the same with fire.</v>

2283
02:19:26.900 --> 02:19:29.150
<v Speaker 10>Fire is the perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>

2284
02:19:29.180 --> 02:19:31.700
<v Speaker 10>we look at icon,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you'll see fire and hell.</v>

2285
02:19:31.860 --> 02:19:36.050
<v Speaker 10>Then you'll see fire coming from the sky</v>
<v Speaker 10>as the manifestation of the Holy Spirit.</v>

2286
02:19:36.051 --> 02:19:37.610
<v Speaker 10>So how,</v>
<v Speaker 10>what does that mean?</v>

2287
02:19:38.010 --> 02:19:39.860
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and so it's the same thing.</v>

2288
02:19:39.861 --> 02:19:40.720
<v Speaker 10>Let's say you,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you,</v>

2289
02:19:40.730 --> 02:19:43.790
<v Speaker 10>you see fire as division.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>

2290
02:19:43.791 --> 02:19:44.624
<v Speaker 10>there's a negative division,</v>
<v Speaker 10>which is the division in which we </v>

2291
02:19:46.941 --> 02:19:49.550
<v Speaker 10>scatter ourselves and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and we're,</v>

2292
02:19:49.880 --> 02:19:50.713
<v Speaker 10>we're consumed.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But there's another type of division </v>

2293
02:19:53.450 --> 02:19:58.450
<v Speaker 10>that say the division of Pentecost,</v>
<v Speaker 10>which is the division which embodies the</v>

2294
02:19:58.521 --> 02:20:02.690
<v Speaker 10>multiplicity of how God manifests </v>
<v Speaker 10>himself in the world.</v>

2295
02:20:02.900 --> 02:20:06.530
<v Speaker 10>And so it just depends on which side you</v>
<v Speaker 10>take each symbol.</v>

2296
02:20:07.330 --> 02:20:09.770
<v Speaker 10>So I hope that answers that question.</v>
<v Speaker 10>What was the second part again?</v>

2297
02:20:11.730 --> 02:20:16.730
<v Speaker 10>Don't think about,</v>
<v Speaker 10>okay.</v>

2298
02:20:22.930 --> 02:20:24.070
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I think I understand.</v>

2299
02:20:24.100 --> 02:20:25.900
<v Speaker 10>I think I understand what that,</v>
<v Speaker 10>what that means.</v>

2300
02:20:26.410 --> 02:20:27.243
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

2301
02:20:28.150 --> 02:20:31.180
<v Speaker 10>I think it did well.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It is my real,</v>

2302
02:20:31.210 --> 02:20:34.690
<v Speaker 10>my belief that symbolism is anchored in </v>
<v Speaker 10>experience.</v>

2303
02:20:35.020 --> 02:20:39.430
<v Speaker 10>And I don't think that most symbols are </v>
<v Speaker 10>not just these abstract things that that</v>

2304
02:20:39.431 --> 02:20:41.770
<v Speaker 10>float above us.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So for example,</v>

2305
02:20:41.990 --> 02:20:44.020
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>a good example would be,</v>

2306
02:20:44.021 --> 02:20:45.650
<v Speaker 10>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the mountain you,</v>

2307
02:20:45.820 --> 02:20:46.653
<v Speaker 10>we see in the Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 10>we have this sense that Moses ascends </v>

2308
02:20:49.661 --> 02:20:50.494
<v Speaker 10>the mountain and then encounters God.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And then we see it repeated over and </v>

2309
02:20:53.171 --> 02:20:54.004
<v Speaker 10>over in,</v>
<v Speaker 10>in the patterns of the stories where </v>

2310
02:20:56.501 --> 02:21:00.820
<v Speaker 10>Christ ascends a heel or a sends a </v>
<v Speaker 10>mountain and then something happens.</v>

2311
02:21:00.880 --> 02:21:02.800
<v Speaker 10>There's a revelation on the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>on this mountain.</v>

2312
02:21:02.980 --> 02:21:04.630
<v Speaker 10>And you think like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>well that's strange,</v>

2313
02:21:04.631 --> 02:21:05.464
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>

2314
02:21:05.950 --> 02:21:08.710
<v Speaker 10>why would you want,</v>
<v Speaker 10>what does the amount and have to do with</v>

2315
02:21:08.711 --> 02:21:09.980
<v Speaker 10>anything?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

2316
02:21:10.390 --> 02:21:11.223
<v Speaker 10>and so I think the key is to </v>
<v Speaker 10>understanding a lot of symbolism is to </v>

2317
02:21:15.161 --> 02:21:17.530
<v Speaker 10>kind of see it as,</v>
<v Speaker 10>as an,</v>

2318
02:21:17.531 --> 02:21:18.730
<v Speaker 10>as an experience.</v>

2319
02:21:19.090 --> 02:21:21.100
<v Speaker 10>And so if you ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 10>for example,</v>

2320
02:21:21.101 --> 02:21:24.790
<v Speaker 10>what happens when I go up a mountain?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Just physically,</v>

2321
02:21:24.791 --> 02:21:29.320
<v Speaker 10>what happens as you go up a mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you,</v>

2322
02:21:29.420 --> 02:21:29.830
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>

2323
02:21:29.830 --> 02:21:32.290
<v Speaker 10>the base of the mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 10>which is the large,</v>

2324
02:21:32.320 --> 02:21:37.320
<v Speaker 10>this huge thing starts to refine itself.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And then it starts to become smaller and</v>

2325
02:21:38.111 --> 02:21:38.944
<v Speaker 10>smaller and smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And that up to you get to the point and </v>

2326
02:21:42.011 --> 02:21:42.844
<v Speaker 10>then everything is one.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And then if you stand at the top of a </v>

2327
02:21:46.631 --> 02:21:49.510
<v Speaker 10>mountain and you look around when you </v>
<v Speaker 10>were at the bottom of the mountain,</v>

2328
02:21:49.511 --> 02:21:53.200
<v Speaker 10>all you can see is the trees and that </v>
<v Speaker 10>are right next to you.</v>

2329
02:21:53.201 --> 02:21:56.080
<v Speaker 10>And you can see a very particular part </v>
<v Speaker 10>of the world.</v>

2330
02:21:56.081 --> 02:21:57.730
<v Speaker 10>But if you ascend to the top of a </v>
<v Speaker 10>mountain,</v>

2331
02:21:57.731 --> 02:22:01.870
<v Speaker 10>then you have this vision of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

2332
02:22:02.080 --> 02:22:02.913
<v Speaker 10>and so the symbolism of the mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 10>which is found in the Bible and the </v>

2333
02:22:06.551 --> 02:22:10.720
<v Speaker 10>Gospel in the icons is akin to the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>

2334
02:22:10.721 --> 02:22:11.554
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the phenomenological reality of that </v>

2335
02:22:13.871 --> 02:22:14.410
<v Speaker 10>thing.</v>

2336
02:22:14.410 --> 02:22:15.243
<v Speaker 10>So we often,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's difficult for us to get that </v>

2337
02:22:16.901 --> 02:22:20.020
<v Speaker 10>because we're so caught up in a </v>
<v Speaker 10>scientific vision of the world that it's</v>

2338
02:22:20.021 --> 02:22:23.020
<v Speaker 10>difficult to understand the symbolism.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But if you,</v>

2339
02:22:23.290 --> 02:22:27.750
<v Speaker 10>if you just put yourself in the position</v>
<v Speaker 10>of someone who does something or someone</v>

2340
02:22:27.960 --> 02:22:29.070
<v Speaker 10>like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>water's the same,</v>

2341
02:22:29.071 --> 02:22:31.860
<v Speaker 10>I mean water would,</v>
<v Speaker 10>would we do with water.</v>

2342
02:22:31.861 --> 02:22:35.340
<v Speaker 10>We wash ourselves with water and what,</v>
<v Speaker 10>what is washing?</v>

2343
02:22:35.490 --> 02:22:40.490
<v Speaker 10>Washing is removing all the external and</v>
<v Speaker 10>dead things that we have on our hands.</v>

2344
02:22:41.970 --> 02:22:44.610
<v Speaker 10>So that we are purified.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Well that's,</v>

2345
02:22:44.611 --> 02:22:46.280
<v Speaker 10>that's one of the symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 10>That's one of the,</v>

2346
02:22:46.281 --> 02:22:47.700
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the symbols of baptism.</v>

2347
02:22:48.300 --> 02:22:49.200
<v Speaker 10>So,</v>
<v Speaker 10>yeah.</v>

2348
02:22:49.230 --> 02:22:51.060
<v Speaker 10>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I hope that explains that</v>

2349
02:22:56.770 --> 02:22:59.590
<v Speaker 1>this question isn't addressed to anyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>in particular.</v>

2350
02:22:59.591 --> 02:23:02.140
<v Speaker 1>So anyone wanting to answer can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2351
02:23:02.200 --> 02:23:03.033
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to hear your thoughts on the </v>

2352
02:23:05.751 --> 02:23:06.584
<v Speaker 1>concept of free will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As many as many of the modern atheist </v>

2353
02:23:11.670 --> 02:23:15.480
<v Speaker 1>believe that free will is an illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2354
02:23:15.490 --> 02:23:18.350
<v Speaker 1>according to their belief in mature in </v>
<v Speaker 1>materialism.</v>

2355
02:23:18.920 --> 02:23:19.753
<v Speaker 1>How does one reconcile freewill with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>omniscient God who knows the end from </v>

2356
02:23:24.051 --> 02:23:29.030
<v Speaker 1>the beginning who knows your future and </v>
<v Speaker 1>created you such that you were compelled</v>

2357
02:23:29.031 --> 02:23:30.620
<v Speaker 1>to realize it?</v>

2358
02:23:37.360 --> 02:23:40.090
<v Speaker 12>So believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 12>we get this question all the time.</v>

2359
02:23:41.680 --> 02:23:44.770
<v Speaker 12>We get this question from teens,</v>
<v Speaker 12>believe this.</v>

2360
02:23:45.250 --> 02:23:47.110
<v Speaker 12>It's the perennial question.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You know,</v>

2361
02:23:47.650 --> 02:23:51.130
<v Speaker 12>if God knows what's going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 12>cause he does,</v>

2362
02:23:51.550 --> 02:23:52.383
<v Speaker 12>if he,</v>
<v Speaker 12>if God is everywhere and fills all </v>

2363
02:23:53.471 --> 02:23:55.120
<v Speaker 12>things,</v>
<v Speaker 12>he is past,</v>

2364
02:23:55.121 --> 02:23:57.400
<v Speaker 12>present and future,</v>
<v Speaker 12>then how can you have freewill?</v>

2365
02:23:57.550 --> 02:23:59.590
<v Speaker 12>And then of course all of those other </v>
<v Speaker 12>implications,</v>

2366
02:23:59.591 --> 02:24:00.690
<v Speaker 12>right?</v>
<v Speaker 12>So know if,</v>

2367
02:24:01.020 --> 02:24:04.030
<v Speaker 12>if I don't have freewill or if God knows</v>
<v Speaker 12>what I'm going to do in the end.</v>

2368
02:24:04.031 --> 02:24:04.864
<v Speaker 12>And then does he create some people too </v>
<v Speaker 12>to go to hell or it could be away from </v>

2369
02:24:08.921 --> 02:24:10.490
<v Speaker 12>him or not,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

2370
02:24:10.540 --> 02:24:12.940
<v Speaker 12>reach union with him and others.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And if so,</v>

2371
02:24:12.941 --> 02:24:14.320
<v Speaker 12>then how can it be love and all these </v>
<v Speaker 12>other things.</v>

2372
02:24:14.321 --> 02:24:15.154
<v Speaker 12>So,</v>
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>

2373
02:24:16.150 --> 02:24:21.150
<v Speaker 12>I think the fundamental misunderstanding</v>
<v Speaker 12>is I would say the concept of time of a,</v>

2374
02:24:23.680 --> 02:24:25.180
<v Speaker 12>of creation itself.</v>

2375
02:24:25.510 --> 02:24:26.343
<v Speaker 12>So the idea that God,</v>
<v Speaker 12>we think as human beings in a linear </v>

2376
02:24:31.180 --> 02:24:31.631
<v Speaker 12>way,</v>
<v Speaker 12>right?</v>

2377
02:24:31.631 --> 02:24:34.540
<v Speaker 12>We have no other way of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So we have a beginning,</v>

2378
02:24:35.140 --> 02:24:37.060
<v Speaker 12>we have a president and then we have an </v>
<v Speaker 12>end.</v>

2379
02:24:37.061 --> 02:24:39.490
<v Speaker 12>And this is the way the world works and </v>
<v Speaker 12>moves in one direction.</v>

2380
02:24:39.900 --> 02:24:40.733
<v Speaker 12>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>we have no concept of God's reality and </v>

2381
02:24:44.771 --> 02:24:47.380
<v Speaker 12>the idea of being outside of time,</v>
<v Speaker 12>we have no concept of that.</v>

2382
02:24:47.670 --> 02:24:50.200
<v Speaker 12>We wouldn't even know how to begin to </v>
<v Speaker 12>think about that if,</v>

2383
02:24:50.530 --> 02:24:52.690
<v Speaker 12>if we tried and people have tried.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Um,</v>

2384
02:24:53.590 --> 02:24:57.730
<v Speaker 12>the easiest analogy I guess for example,</v>
<v Speaker 12>that I could,</v>

2385
02:24:58.030 --> 02:24:59.980
<v Speaker 12>I could give would be,</v>
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>

2386
02:25:00.730 --> 02:25:03.970
<v Speaker 12>the idea of perspective and what do we </v>
<v Speaker 12>mean by that?</v>

2387
02:25:05.650 --> 02:25:09.830
<v Speaker 12>Let's say I'm the camera person here,</v>
<v Speaker 12>right?</v>

2388
02:25:09.850 --> 02:25:14.110
<v Speaker 12>And I'm watching this kind of whole </v>
<v Speaker 12>event unfolding,</v>

2389
02:25:14.750 --> 02:25:16.060
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>after it's happened.</v>

2390
02:25:16.090 --> 02:25:17.380
<v Speaker 12>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it's been videotaped,</v>

2391
02:25:17.381 --> 02:25:18.214
<v Speaker 12>right?</v>
<v Speaker 12>And somebody else can watch this and </v>

2392
02:25:19.420 --> 02:25:21.280
<v Speaker 12>they can watch this event and they can </v>
<v Speaker 12>forward,</v>

2393
02:25:21.340 --> 02:25:22.173
<v Speaker 12>they go back and they can back to see </v>
<v Speaker 12>something that they really liked or </v>

2394
02:25:24.671 --> 02:25:25.504
<v Speaker 12>something that they forgot or they can </v>
<v Speaker 12>fast forward to the end and see how it </v>

2395
02:25:28.421 --> 02:25:29.254
<v Speaker 12>all turned out.</v>

2396
02:25:29.410 --> 02:25:31.590
<v Speaker 12>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the person who is watching that,</v>

2397
02:25:31.591 --> 02:25:34.030
<v Speaker 12>who is removed from that reality,</v>
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>

2398
02:25:34.150 --> 02:25:36.460
<v Speaker 12>they can see what's going on and what's </v>
<v Speaker 12>not going on.</v>

2399
02:25:36.461 --> 02:25:39.040
<v Speaker 12>They can jump ahead in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but they don't cause it.</v>

2400
02:25:39.650 --> 02:25:40.483
<v Speaker 12>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it's just their perspective is </v>

2401
02:25:41.231 --> 02:25:42.760
<v Speaker 12>different.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So this idea,</v>

2402
02:25:42.761 --> 02:25:44.710
<v Speaker 12>and of course this is kind of a crude </v>
<v Speaker 12>analogy,</v>

2403
02:25:44.970 --> 02:25:45.803
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>of course it's much more complex than </v>

2404
02:25:47.261 --> 02:25:48.640
<v Speaker 12>that.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And it's much more nuanced than that.</v>

2405
02:25:49.060 --> 02:25:49.621
<v Speaker 12>And,</v>
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>

2406
02:25:49.621 --> 02:25:51.100
<v Speaker 12>and,</v>
<v Speaker 12>and of course we would,</v>

2407
02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:53.230
<v Speaker 12>we would leave at least as Orthodox </v>
<v Speaker 12>Christians is that God is,</v>

2408
02:25:53.570 --> 02:25:54.730
<v Speaker 12>is,</v>
<v Speaker 12>is much more,</v>

2409
02:25:54.731 --> 02:25:55.564
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>permeates all things and is working in </v>

2410
02:25:58.181 --> 02:25:59.750
<v Speaker 12>people's lives.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Um,</v>

2411
02:26:00.460 --> 02:26:03.340
<v Speaker 12>but there is a strange paradox between </v>
<v Speaker 12>free will,</v>

2412
02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:08.400
<v Speaker 12>the idea that we have the choice whether</v>
<v Speaker 12>we want to follow God to believe in him,</v>

2413
02:26:10.020 --> 02:26:11.950
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 12>or to believe rather than ourselves.</v>

2414
02:26:11.951 --> 02:26:12.660
<v Speaker 12>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>

2415
02:26:12.660 --> 02:26:14.650
<v Speaker 12>as professor [inaudible] said,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

2416
02:26:14.830 --> 02:26:19.030
<v Speaker 12>the reality of the hell that many of us </v>
<v Speaker 12>live in and the reality of the hell that</v>

2417
02:26:19.031 --> 02:26:19.864
<v Speaker 12>has been created by societies and </v>
<v Speaker 12>civilizations all over the world is a </v>

2418
02:26:23.471 --> 02:26:26.740
<v Speaker 12>proof of the reality of freewill proof.</v>

2419
02:26:27.320 --> 02:26:29.440
<v Speaker 12>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>at least for people who believe in God.</v>

2420
02:26:29.830 --> 02:26:30.690
<v Speaker 12>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 12>if you don't believe in God,</v>

2421
02:26:30.730 --> 02:26:32.560
<v Speaker 12>different story and then you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 12>well,</v>

2422
02:26:32.561 --> 02:26:34.300
<v Speaker 12>that's not proof of anything except that</v>
<v Speaker 12>we're just,</v>

2423
02:26:34.570 --> 02:26:37.390
<v Speaker 12>we're just animals living on this planet</v>
<v Speaker 12>and there's no meaning to anything.</v>

2424
02:26:37.870 --> 02:26:41.230
<v Speaker 12>But if there's a god and there are still</v>
<v Speaker 12>horrible things happening,</v>

2425
02:26:41.530 --> 02:26:43.830
<v Speaker 12>we'll either that God is,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

2426
02:26:44.410 --> 02:26:48.850
<v Speaker 12>an evil being or rather that we have the</v>
<v Speaker 12>free will not to believe in him,</v>

2427
02:26:48.851 --> 02:26:50.530
<v Speaker 12>not to follow him,</v>
<v Speaker 12>not to do his will.</v>

2428
02:26:51.040 --> 02:26:52.020
<v Speaker 12>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>and,</v>

2429
02:26:52.300 --> 02:26:56.590
<v Speaker 12>and that may seem like a horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 12>horrible thing for God to give to us.</v>

2430
02:26:56.890 --> 02:26:58.100
<v Speaker 12>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>this idea of free will.</v>

2431
02:26:58.570 --> 02:27:00.580
<v Speaker 12>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>and yet it is also the greatest thing,</v>

2432
02:27:01.120 --> 02:27:01.953
<v Speaker 12>the greatest thing because it's not only</v>
<v Speaker 12>the idea of us avoiding suffering or US </v>

2433
02:27:05.561 --> 02:27:09.130
<v Speaker 12>avoiding sin or US avoiding the evil </v>
<v Speaker 12>that we created within the world,</v>

2434
02:27:09.490 --> 02:27:11.200
<v Speaker 12>but is the idea of the,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you,</v>

2435
02:27:11.230 --> 02:27:15.070
<v Speaker 12>the idea that through our own sin and </v>
<v Speaker 12>through our own difficulties,</v>

2436
02:27:15.340 --> 02:27:17.080
<v Speaker 12>we somehow find meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And we,</v>

2437
02:27:17.081 --> 02:27:19.030
<v Speaker 12>and we come up on the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So,</v>

2438
02:27:19.380 --> 02:27:21.310
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I,</v>

2439
02:27:21.910 --> 02:27:24.910
<v Speaker 12>I don't know how much better I can,</v>
<v Speaker 12>can try to explain it.</v>

2440
02:27:24.911 --> 02:27:26.020
<v Speaker 12>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it's a complex thing,</v>

2441
02:27:26.050 --> 02:27:26.883
<v Speaker 12>but</v>

2442
02:27:34.500 --> 02:27:35.333
<v Speaker 13>so in the mythological world,</v>
<v Speaker 13>I would say there are three continually </v>

2443
02:27:42.001 --> 02:27:47.001
<v Speaker 13>intertwined causal elements.</v>
<v Speaker 13>One of one is consciousness.</v>

2444
02:27:47.251 --> 02:27:51.450
<v Speaker 13>You could say that's the logos.</v>
<v Speaker 13>One is the interpretive structure within</v>

2445
02:27:51.451 --> 02:27:55.560
<v Speaker 13>which that logo's exists.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And that's the framework that you used.</v>

2446
02:27:55.561 --> 02:27:59.190
<v Speaker 13>Organize yourself cognitively within the</v>
<v Speaker 13>world,</v>

2447
02:27:59.220 --> 02:28:01.920
<v Speaker 13>your point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And then there's the world itself,</v>

2448
02:28:01.921 --> 02:28:02.754
<v Speaker 13>the natural world.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Let's say those three things are always </v>

2449
02:28:05.670 --> 02:28:09.480
<v Speaker 13>in interplay and they're each given </v>
<v Speaker 13>causal primacy.</v>

2450
02:28:10.120 --> 02:28:10.953
<v Speaker 13>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you see this echoed in popular culture </v>

2451
02:28:13.111 --> 02:28:17.570
<v Speaker 13>motifs and I think Pinocchio is a very </v>
<v Speaker 13>good example of that where Pinocchio has</v>

2452
02:28:17.571 --> 02:28:20.580
<v Speaker 13>it farther.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And that's tapatio who's his creator?</v>

2453
02:28:20.581 --> 02:28:21.414
<v Speaker 13>And he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 13>so we're very deterministic sort of </v>

2454
02:28:23.031 --> 02:28:23.864
<v Speaker 13>creature and he has a mother and that's </v>
<v Speaker 13>the blue fairy that comes down from </v>

2455
02:28:26.931 --> 02:28:31.280
<v Speaker 13>heaven who's really f a figure of the </v>
<v Speaker 13>vitality of nature.</v>

2456
02:28:31.640 --> 02:28:36.230
<v Speaker 13>And so Pinocchio is portrayed in the </v>
<v Speaker 13>movie as child of nature and culture,</v>

2457
02:28:36.260 --> 02:28:38.720
<v Speaker 13>which is of course how we're portrayed </v>
<v Speaker 13>scientifically.</v>

2458
02:28:38.720 --> 02:28:39.553
<v Speaker 13>But,</v>
<v Speaker 13>but there's a third element in that </v>

2459
02:28:42.260 --> 02:28:43.093
<v Speaker 13>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 13>which is really what drives the plot </v>

2460
02:28:44.331 --> 02:28:45.164
<v Speaker 13>forward,</v>
<v Speaker 13>which is Pinocchio's capacity to make </v>

2461
02:28:46.761 --> 02:28:49.160
<v Speaker 13>choices.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And that's his consciousness.</v>

2462
02:28:49.161 --> 02:28:53.480
<v Speaker 13>And that's also what elevates him above </v>
<v Speaker 13>the status of deterministic puppet.</v>

2463
02:28:54.230 --> 02:28:55.850
<v Speaker 13>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 13>well,</v>

2464
02:28:55.851 --> 02:28:58.070
<v Speaker 13>there's no evidence that we're not </v>
<v Speaker 13>deterministic.</v>

2465
02:28:58.071 --> 02:28:58.791
<v Speaker 13>And I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 13>well,</v>

2466
02:28:58.791 --> 02:29:02.150
<v Speaker 13>that's fine because there's also no </v>
<v Speaker 13>evidence that we are deterministic.</v>

2467
02:29:02.151 --> 02:29:02.984
<v Speaker 13>So we can leave that as a draw,</v>
<v Speaker 13>but we certainly treat each other as if </v>

2468
02:29:06.561 --> 02:29:07.394
<v Speaker 13>we have freewill.</v>
<v Speaker 13>We treat ourselves as if we have free </v>

2469
02:29:10.071 --> 02:29:10.904
<v Speaker 13>will.</v>
<v Speaker 13>We even those of us who regard each </v>

2470
02:29:13.041 --> 02:29:13.874
<v Speaker 13>other as deterministic,</v>
<v Speaker 13>believe that or has determined to </v>

2471
02:29:16.361 --> 02:29:17.194
<v Speaker 13>believe that in their own actions,</v>
<v Speaker 13>they're going to be perfectly irritated </v>

2472
02:29:20.001 --> 02:29:22.910
<v Speaker 13>at whatever choices you make that happen</v>
<v Speaker 13>to infringe upon them.</v>

2473
02:29:22.911 --> 02:29:26.630
<v Speaker 13>And they're going to act towards you as </v>
<v Speaker 13>if you're an agent with free will.</v>

2474
02:29:26.930 --> 02:29:30.170
<v Speaker 13>So they can say they regard people as </v>
<v Speaker 13>deterministic,</v>

2475
02:29:30.171 --> 02:29:33.110
<v Speaker 13>but they don't act it out.</v>
<v Speaker 13>So I don't believe that they believe it.</v>

2476
02:29:33.111 --> 02:29:33.944
<v Speaker 13>And I also don't believe that you can </v>
<v Speaker 13>produce a functional society without </v>

2477
02:29:36.921 --> 02:29:37.754
<v Speaker 13>having something like that at its basis.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And I've never seen any evidence of a </v>

2478
02:29:40.941 --> 02:29:43.250
<v Speaker 13>functional society being produced with </v>
<v Speaker 13>that,</v>

2479
02:29:43.280 --> 02:29:45.590
<v Speaker 13>without that as a metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 13>presupposition.</v>

2480
02:29:46.250 --> 02:29:47.083
<v Speaker 13>So,</v>
<v Speaker 13>but there's something more crucially </v>

2481
02:29:48.800 --> 02:29:50.600
<v Speaker 13>crucial involved here too,</v>
<v Speaker 13>is that</v>

2482
02:29:52.190 --> 02:29:57.190
<v Speaker 13>in order to accept the inevitability of </v>
<v Speaker 13>determinism and human action,</v>

2483
02:29:57.771 --> 02:29:58.604
<v Speaker 13>you have to accept the presupposition </v>
<v Speaker 13>that consciousness is nothing but an </v>

2484
02:30:01.191 --> 02:30:03.620
<v Speaker 13>empath phenomena of a deeper material </v>
<v Speaker 13>reality.</v>

2485
02:30:03.621 --> 02:30:05.600
<v Speaker 13>And first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 13>we do not know that.</v>

2486
02:30:05.630 --> 02:30:10.010
<v Speaker 13>We certainly do not know that what we </v>
<v Speaker 13>know about consciousness scientifically,</v>

2487
02:30:10.011 --> 02:30:13.850
<v Speaker 13>you could put in a thimble and still </v>
<v Speaker 13>have enough room for another thimble.</v>

2488
02:30:14.090 --> 02:30:16.430
<v Speaker 13>We know nothing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It's a mystery.</v>

2489
02:30:16.431 --> 02:30:18.920
<v Speaker 13>We have not cracked at all.</v>

2490
02:30:19.070 --> 02:30:19.903
<v Speaker 13>And people have been battling away </v>
<v Speaker 13>pretty hard on it from a scientific </v>

2491
02:30:22.701 --> 02:30:26.300
<v Speaker 13>perspective for the last 40 years since </v>
<v Speaker 13>it's become in vogue again.</v>

2492
02:30:26.301 --> 02:30:28.220
<v Speaker 13>And I don't think we've moved forward a </v>
<v Speaker 13>little bit.</v>

2493
02:30:28.760 --> 02:30:31.070
<v Speaker 13>And then finally,</v>
<v Speaker 13>so it's a mystery.</v>

2494
02:30:31.071 --> 02:30:31.601
<v Speaker 13>And,</v>
<v Speaker 13>and,</v>

2495
02:30:31.601 --> 02:30:32.434
<v Speaker 13>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 13>I don't think there's any evidence </v>

2496
02:30:33.711 --> 02:30:34.544
<v Speaker 13>whatsoever that it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 13>I read Dan Dennett spit book on </v>

2497
02:30:36.561 --> 02:30:39.020
<v Speaker 13>explaining consciousness and it does </v>
<v Speaker 13>nothing of the sort.</v>

2498
02:30:39.500 --> 02:30:41.510
<v Speaker 13>It explains it away.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And that's that.</v>

2499
02:30:41.511 --> 02:30:43.370
<v Speaker 13>And many critics have made the same </v>
<v Speaker 13>comment.</v>

2500
02:30:43.910 --> 02:30:47.150
<v Speaker 13>But I also think that phenomenologically</v>
<v Speaker 13>speaking,</v>

2501
02:30:47.180 --> 02:30:52.180
<v Speaker 13>it is the case that we seem to encounter</v>
<v Speaker 13>the world as a field of possibility from</v>

2502
02:30:53.001 --> 02:30:56.060
<v Speaker 13>which we extract out choices.</v>
<v Speaker 13>You know,</v>

2503
02:30:56.061 --> 02:30:56.870
<v Speaker 13>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 13>well,</v>

2504
02:30:56.870 --> 02:30:58.880
<v Speaker 13>when I talked to you about your future,</v>
<v Speaker 13>I mean,</v>

2505
02:30:58.881 --> 02:31:02.630
<v Speaker 13>you know what your future is.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It's a branching set of pathways,</v>

2506
02:31:02.690 --> 02:31:05.990
<v Speaker 13>which you can envision because you,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you can envision the future.</v>

2507
02:31:05.991 --> 02:31:08.060
<v Speaker 13>It's one of the very strange things </v>
<v Speaker 13>about being human.</v>

2508
02:31:08.300 --> 02:31:09.133
<v Speaker 13>It's a branching set of pathways of </v>
<v Speaker 13>possibilities and you can pick from </v>

2509
02:31:12.891 --> 02:31:13.724
<v Speaker 13>among them.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And I do believe that's what you're </v>

2510
02:31:15.741 --> 02:31:16.574
<v Speaker 13>doing is I do believe that the world is </v>
<v Speaker 13>a well of possibility and potential and </v>

2511
02:31:20.251 --> 02:31:24.090
<v Speaker 13>that you interact with it by choice and </v>
<v Speaker 13>transform it,</v>

2512
02:31:24.150 --> 02:31:27.720
<v Speaker 13>it within your limited power into what </v>
<v Speaker 13>you wanted to be.</v>

2513
02:31:28.270 --> 02:31:29.103
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2514
02:31:31.280 --> 02:31:33.770
<v Speaker 13>and I don't think there's any evidence </v>
<v Speaker 13>to the contrary.</v>

2515
02:31:33.880 --> 02:31:38.570
<v Speaker 13>And besides determinism is a,</v>
<v Speaker 13>is a scientific philosophy that probably</v>

2516
02:31:38.571 --> 02:31:41.810
<v Speaker 13>lost it's vogue in about 1850.</v>
<v Speaker 13>So,</v>

2517
02:31:41.870 --> 02:31:44.240
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 13>there's no,</v>

2518
02:31:44.270 --> 02:31:49.270
<v Speaker 13>there's just no reason to from a </v>
<v Speaker 13>scientific perspective to describe human</v>

2519
02:31:49.371 --> 02:31:52.490
<v Speaker 13>beings as deterministic creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 13>There's no evidence for it.</v>

2520
02:31:52.700 --> 02:31:53.533
<v Speaker 13>So we're partly determined obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 13>because there's lots of things we can't </v>

2521
02:31:57.411 --> 02:31:58.244
<v Speaker 13>do,</v>
<v Speaker 13>but that does not by any stretch of the </v>

2522
02:32:00.591 --> 02:32:02.560
<v Speaker 13>imagination mean we're fully determined </v>
<v Speaker 13>yet.</v>

2523
02:32:02.810 --> 02:32:03.643
<v Speaker 13>So,</v>

2524
02:32:07.530 --> 02:32:08.363
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2525
02:32:09.800 --> 02:32:11.690
<v Speaker 11>Can I just add to that that,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I mean,</v>

2526
02:32:11.691 --> 02:32:14.090
<v Speaker 11>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 11>that's a thoroughly Orthodox answer.</v>

2527
02:32:14.180 --> 02:32:15.220
<v Speaker 11>I have to say.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Um,</v>

2528
02:32:16.010 --> 02:32:19.640
<v Speaker 11>we only can deal with what we have in </v>
<v Speaker 11>front of us.</v>

2529
02:32:19.700 --> 02:32:20.533
<v Speaker 11>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 11>picking up on Jonathan's point earlier </v>

2530
02:32:21.501 --> 02:32:22.334
<v Speaker 11>about experience and our our own going </v>
<v Speaker 11>forward with the church fathers tell us </v>

2531
02:32:26.870 --> 02:32:31.040
<v Speaker 11>the contrary to this scientific notion </v>
<v Speaker 11>of,</v>

2532
02:32:31.190 --> 02:32:34.310
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>time moving forward at a kind of regular</v>

2533
02:32:34.311 --> 02:32:36.560
<v Speaker 11>rate or anything that we might have </v>
<v Speaker 11>conceived in our minds.</v>

2534
02:32:36.820 --> 02:32:41.240
<v Speaker 11>It actually,</v>
<v Speaker 11>each infinitesimally small moment of our</v>

2535
02:32:41.241 --> 02:32:42.074
<v Speaker 11>existence is pregnant with infinite </v>
<v Speaker 11>possibility and so it's precisely what </v>

2536
02:32:47.421 --> 02:32:50.750
<v Speaker 11>has just been set that we have that </v>
<v Speaker 11>within our grasp.</v>

2537
02:32:50.780 --> 02:32:51.613
<v Speaker 11>If only we have the eyes to see it,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the only we have the hearts and minds </v>

2538
02:32:54.261 --> 02:32:55.094
<v Speaker 11>oriented to that,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the logos guiding us then I mean the </v>

2539
02:32:58.281 --> 02:33:03.281
<v Speaker 11>church fathers talk about the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 11>we can actually experience infinity.</v>

2540
02:33:04.770 --> 02:33:05.100
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2541
02:33:05.100 --> 02:33:08.000
<v Speaker 11>In the tiniest of moments.</v>
<v Speaker 11>That's what fails.</v>

2542
02:33:08.001 --> 02:33:08.834
<v Speaker 11>This is all about,</v>
<v Speaker 11>that's what coming into contact with </v>

2543
02:33:10.620 --> 02:33:12.930
<v Speaker 11>uncreated energies is all about.</v>
<v Speaker 11>In the,</v>

2544
02:33:12.931 --> 02:33:17.931
<v Speaker 11>in the eastern spiritual tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 11>that time and space are elastic.</v>

2545
02:33:18.180 --> 02:33:19.013
<v Speaker 11>We knew that before Einstein ever even </v>
<v Speaker 11>was born and that's what we have in </v>

2546
02:33:23.551 --> 02:33:24.384
<v Speaker 11>front of us.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So let's not get into philosophical </v>

2547
02:33:26.430 --> 02:33:31.160
<v Speaker 11>arguments about how God works and how he</v>
<v Speaker 11>sees his precisely other Ted's points.</v>

2548
02:33:31.170 --> 02:33:35.790
<v Speaker 11>I mean that's irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 11>What we know is that every tiny,</v>

2549
02:33:35.791 --> 02:33:36.624
<v Speaker 11>tiny moment of every day and every space</v>
<v Speaker 11>of this macro cosmos is the possibility </v>

2550
02:33:41.821 --> 02:33:45.990
<v Speaker 11>of encountering the infinite and that </v>
<v Speaker 11>that's what we have to reach forward and</v>

2551
02:33:45.991 --> 02:33:46.824
<v Speaker 11>grasp.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And that's what our whole tradition is </v>

2552
02:33:48.451 --> 02:33:49.920
<v Speaker 11>about.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And so absolutely,</v>

2553
02:33:49.921 --> 02:33:50.754
<v Speaker 11>it is our position on that point.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So we don't get into debates about </v>

2554
02:33:54.420 --> 02:33:56.090
<v Speaker 11>predestination and,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and,</v>

2555
02:33:56.091 --> 02:33:58.260
<v Speaker 11>and not,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it's irrelevant to us.</v>

2556
02:33:58.290 --> 02:34:01.590
<v Speaker 11>We just need to grab a hold of God where</v>
<v Speaker 11>he is,</v>

2557
02:34:01.591 --> 02:34:04.680
<v Speaker 11>which is right now in this moment,</v>
<v Speaker 11>in this space as we are.</v>

2558
02:34:05.190 --> 02:34:06.023
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2559
02:34:07.020 --> 02:34:07.853
<v Speaker 11>Thank you very much father,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and thank you very much to each and </v>

2560
02:34:10.411 --> 02:34:12.180
<v Speaker 11>every one of our panelists.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Uh,</v>

2561
02:34:12.360 --> 02:34:14.610
<v Speaker 11>could I just get a round of applause for</v>
<v Speaker 11>all of you</v>

2562
02:34:34.200 --> 02:34:35.033
<v Speaker 1>to conclude this night?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you to absolutely everyone for </v>

2563
02:34:37.641 --> 02:34:40.760
<v Speaker 1>coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope we've managed to learn a lot.</v>

2564
02:34:40.790 --> 02:34:41.623
<v Speaker 1>This has been recorded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just in case this was too much </v>

2565
02:34:43.581 --> 02:34:46.310
<v Speaker 1>information to take in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is certainly was for me,</v>

2566
02:34:46.520 --> 02:34:49.120
<v Speaker 1>it will be available at some point or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

2567
02:34:49.130 --> 02:34:51.050
<v Speaker 1>So once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you all for coming out.</v>
