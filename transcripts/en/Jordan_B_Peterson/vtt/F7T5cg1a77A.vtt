1
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.400
<v Speaker 1>last week we spent a fair bit of time </v>
<v Speaker 1>assessing</v>

3
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.860
<v Speaker 1>the structure of the first two stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>in genesis and I made the case that</v>

4
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.853
<v Speaker 1>they were stories about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rise of humanity into self </v>

5
00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:32.010
<v Speaker 1>consciousness or the descent of humanity</v>
<v Speaker 1>into selfconsciousness,</v>

6
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.083
<v Speaker 1>depending on which way you look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should also point out that there's </v>

7
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:37.044
<v Speaker 1>been a lot of debate</v>
<v Speaker 1>among religious traditions that were </v>

8
00:00:42.851 --> 00:00:47.800
<v Speaker 1>associated with those stories about </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether the fall was an improvement or a</v>

9
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.010
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today we're going to discuss at least to</v>

10
00:00:56.331 --> 00:00:58.940
<v Speaker 1>begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to discuss the</v>

11
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.830
<v Speaker 1>story of the Buddha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I want to do that,</v>

12
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.860
<v Speaker 1>it's two fold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well first,</v>

13
00:01:06.861 --> 00:01:07.694
<v Speaker 1>because it's an interesting story in </v>
<v Speaker 1>second because the parallels between it </v>

14
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.000
<v Speaker 1>and the story in genesis are I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're quite remarkable</v>

15
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.710
<v Speaker 1>and it's not that easy to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly why they're there.</v>

16
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.040
<v Speaker 1>So here's the story</v>

17
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.603
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

18
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.443
<v Speaker 1>so a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>king got news that he was going to have </v>

19
00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:32.354
<v Speaker 1>a son and an angel visited him and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your son is going to have one of two </v>

20
00:01:39.171 --> 00:01:40.004
<v Speaker 1>destinies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's either going to become a great and </v>

21
00:01:42.861 --> 00:01:47.450
<v Speaker 1>powerful world ruler or he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become</v>

22
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.273
<v Speaker 1>a spiritual leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the king thought it was a very </v>

23
00:01:55.131 --> 00:01:56.300
<v Speaker 1>practical man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

24
00:01:56.301 --> 00:01:57.134
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no damn way my son is going to </v>

25
00:01:58.101 --> 00:01:58.934
<v Speaker 1>become a spiritual leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we thought all make sure that he </v>

26
00:02:03.441 --> 00:02:05.150
<v Speaker 1>falls in love with life.</v>

27
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:07.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

28
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.503
<v Speaker 1>So the king built a city before his son </v>
<v Speaker 1>was born and wall did the end and made </v>

29
00:02:15.681 --> 00:02:16.514
<v Speaker 1>it as beautiful as he could possibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it and then decreed that within </v>

30
00:02:20.991 --> 00:02:25.991
<v Speaker 1>that city there were nothing but joy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there were no people who the only</v>

31
00:02:27.321 --> 00:02:29.390
<v Speaker 1>people that were allowed in were young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive,</v>

32
00:02:29.391 --> 00:02:30.224
<v Speaker 1>and healthy by express demand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the Buddha grew up in that city </v>

33
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.490
<v Speaker 1>and fell in love with life just as his </v>
<v Speaker 1>father had hoped.</v>

34
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.483
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

35
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.930
<v Speaker 1>the analogy that I see there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll pursue it in more detail,</v>

36
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:59.931
<v Speaker 1>but the first analogy is the idea of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>safe and segregated like a wallet space.</v>

37
00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:04.420
<v Speaker 1>So parodies of paradise means walled </v>
<v Speaker 1>garden.</v>

38
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:07.120
<v Speaker 1>And I mentioned that Eden means </v>
<v Speaker 1>well-watered place.</v>

39
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:08.583
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you want to produce a paradise </v>

40
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:12.814
<v Speaker 1>for someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you all in a space and you keep </v>

41
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:15.904
<v Speaker 1>everything that's not acceptable or that</v>
<v Speaker 1>might cause existential distress let's </v>

42
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:21.430
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And You keep that out.</v>

43
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.160
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's also,</v>

44
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 1>there's also a very interesting analog </v>
<v Speaker 1>between that and the genesis story,</v>

45
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:31.330
<v Speaker 1>but also between that and the role of </v>
<v Speaker 1>parenthood in general.</v>

46
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.360
<v Speaker 1>Because what you essentially do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>young children is you wall off the space</v>

47
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.920
<v Speaker 1>and you try to make the conditions </v>
<v Speaker 1>within that space optimal.</v>

48
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that you do that is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the kids,</v>

49
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.513
<v Speaker 1>your kids fall in love with life and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to be cared for properly and </v>

50
00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:53.290
<v Speaker 1>attended to and cajoled in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>into living.</v>

51
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean we know for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

52
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.930
<v Speaker 1>children who don't receive proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical care,</v>

53
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.840
<v Speaker 1>proper love is the right way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>describing it,</v>

54
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.633
<v Speaker 1>don't thrive and sometimes they die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it isn't enough to provide </v>

55
00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:11.404
<v Speaker 1>children with food and shelter</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to protect them from the elements </v>

56
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.520
<v Speaker 1>they have to be interacted with </v>
<v Speaker 1>physically.</v>

57
00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:21.820
<v Speaker 1>They have to be touched because </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise they don't live.</v>

58
00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:24.130
<v Speaker 1>And they have to be interacted with </v>
<v Speaker 1>continually.</v>

59
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.920
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that became very clear.</v>

60
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:28.653
<v Speaker 1>Well it was first learned in the late 18</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds when the mortality rate for </v>

61
00:04:33.671 --> 00:04:34.504
<v Speaker 1>orphans under one was 100%</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy in New York whose name </v>

62
00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:43.540
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately escapes me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was very curious about why this is b was</v>

63
00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:45.220
<v Speaker 1>because the children were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:04:45.221 --> 00:04:49.210
<v Speaker 1>at least receiving what you might think </v>
<v Speaker 1>of as the bare minimum of care.</v>

65
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.853
<v Speaker 1>And he journeyed to Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had heard about a nurse there named </v>

66
00:04:56.201 --> 00:05:01.201
<v Speaker 1>fat Ana who had the miraculous ability </v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep children under one alive,</v>

67
00:05:03.461 --> 00:05:04.690
<v Speaker 1>at least in her ward.</v>

68
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.130
<v Speaker 1>The mortality rate was much lower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he went there to observe what she</v>

69
00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:09.964
<v Speaker 1>was doing and all she was doing was </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking the children out of their little </v>

70
00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:14.014
<v Speaker 1>infant cribs and putting them sort of on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a carrier on her hip and just walking </v>

71
00:05:19.541 --> 00:05:20.374
<v Speaker 1>around with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she'd put that child back in </v>

72
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:25.270
<v Speaker 1>the crib and take another one out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>walk around with the child.</v>

73
00:05:25.271 --> 00:05:28.120
<v Speaker 1>And so the child got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.630
<v Speaker 1>surface contact and a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stimulation.</v>

75
00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:34.030
<v Speaker 1>And that seemed to be enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's pretty minimal,</v>

76
00:05:34.031 --> 00:05:34.864
<v Speaker 1>but it was it a lot better than nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was the first time that people </v>

77
00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:45.841
<v Speaker 1>understood explicitly that there were </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessities to childcare other than,</v>

78
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.830
<v Speaker 1>you know what you might regard as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bare minimum</v>

79
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.270
<v Speaker 1>with little rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rat pups.</v>

80
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.823
<v Speaker 1>If you take rat pups away from their </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother and you feed them and give them </v>

81
00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:03.290
<v Speaker 1>enough water and warm fail also guide.</v>

82
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.450
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that you have to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

83
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.973
<v Speaker 1>what are what the research is do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them as they take a pencil with an </v>

84
00:06:10.551 --> 00:06:13.970
<v Speaker 1>eraser on the end of it and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>massage the little rat pups with the,</v>

85
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:15.403
<v Speaker 1>with the research end of the pencil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's enough to make them feel </v>

86
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.050
<v Speaker 1>loved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose.</v>

87
00:06:21.051 --> 00:06:23.020
<v Speaker 1>And Ben,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they thrive and,</v>

88
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.900
<v Speaker 1>and there was a woman named Tiffany </v>
<v Speaker 1>Fields,</v>

89
00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.170
<v Speaker 1>I think this work was originally done by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jaak Panksepp,</v>

90
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:31.483
<v Speaker 1>the massage work with the rat pups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a woman named tiffany field </v>

91
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.123
<v Speaker 1>who started the program in Florida where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they massaged premature infants who are </v>

92
00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:43.034
<v Speaker 1>in the incubators for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was three times a day for </v>

93
00:06:46.401 --> 00:06:50.020
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happens with children,</v>

94
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.370
<v Speaker 1>these are premature infants generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are in incubators.</v>

95
00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:54.350
<v Speaker 1>What generally happens to them is first </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all,</v>

96
00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:55.184
<v Speaker 1>they lose weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really not good because </v>

97
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.033
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infants near birth are supposed to be </v>

98
00:06:59.901 --> 00:07:01.490
<v Speaker 1>packing on a lot of weight.</v>

99
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.873
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so any loss is not only the loss but </v>

100
00:07:06.591 --> 00:07:09.530
<v Speaker 1>also a decrease from the gain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

101
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:09.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

102
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:10.813
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it raises their mortality rates </v>

103
00:07:11.961 --> 00:07:12.794
<v Speaker 1>substantially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what fields and her researchers </v>

104
00:07:14.721 --> 00:07:19.520
<v Speaker 1>found that was that three minutes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>three sessions of massage for 10 minutes</v>

105
00:07:19.521 --> 00:07:20.354
<v Speaker 1>a day would the babies who were given </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would gain weight as fast as </v>

106
00:07:26.631 --> 00:07:27.464
<v Speaker 1>children who were still in the womb and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could detect positive </v>

107
00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.600
<v Speaker 1>physiological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological and so forth,</v>

108
00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:40.040
<v Speaker 1>emotional benefits six months later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very long time in them in the</v>

109
00:07:40.041 --> 00:07:42.620
<v Speaker 1>life of an infant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

110
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:45.770
<v Speaker 1>so that's all to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

111
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.633
<v Speaker 1>the role of parents is to set up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>protective wall for all intensive </v>

112
00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:57.560
<v Speaker 1>purposes around their children so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not subjected to,</v>

113
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:01.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unabated harshness of life.</v>

114
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.650
<v Speaker 1>And then to cajole them into living and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thriving.</v>

115
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:08.213
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need know that children have a place </v>

116
00:08:09.711 --> 00:08:12.170
<v Speaker 1>circuit that separate so they need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>play.</v>

117
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:17.360
<v Speaker 1>And the touch circ seems to be mediated </v>
<v Speaker 1>by all opiates.</v>

118
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:18.643
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the consequences of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if a child has scraped his or </v>

119
00:08:22.191 --> 00:08:23.024
<v Speaker 1>her knee and comes running up to you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>says fix it and you give them a hug and </v>

120
00:08:26.091 --> 00:08:26.924
<v Speaker 1>pat them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fixes it because the touch is </v>

121
00:08:29.571 --> 00:08:30.404
<v Speaker 1>actually analgesic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's also a useful thing to know </v>

122
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:35.263
<v Speaker 1>if you're ever dealing with someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's grieving because there's not much </v>

123
00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:43.160
<v Speaker 1>you can do about grief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From our cognitive perspective,</v>

124
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:46.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can help allay people's guilt</v>

125
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.880
<v Speaker 1>is if they're suffering from undue guilt</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the circumstances.</v>

126
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:53.803
<v Speaker 1>But if they're grieving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're are in pain because grief is a </v>

127
00:08:56.371 --> 00:08:58.770
<v Speaker 1>pain response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technically speaking,</v>

128
00:08:58.771 --> 00:08:59.604
<v Speaker 1>you can leave it with opiates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can also alleviate it with </v>

129
00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:02.364
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also something else worth </v>

130
00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:05.844
<v Speaker 1>knowing because sometimes you'll see </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's so deep in grief that </v>

131
00:09:09.301 --> 00:09:11.270
<v Speaker 1>they're going to hurt themselves because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

132
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:12.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's traumatizing.</v>

133
00:09:12.691 --> 00:09:15.240
<v Speaker 1>It'll produce brain damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll really do the men.</v>

134
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.313
<v Speaker 1>And that's just not helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's useful to know that </v>

135
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.890
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants can ameliorate that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

136
00:09:22.891 --> 00:09:23.641
<v Speaker 1>and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

137
00:09:23.641 --> 00:09:26.370
<v Speaker 1>people still have to go through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Natural grieving process.</v>

138
00:09:26.371 --> 00:09:27.204
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well actually the grieving process is </v>

139
00:09:30.091 --> 00:09:30.924
<v Speaker 1>the pain that the healing process is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rebuilding of a life outside of the </v>

140
00:09:36.091 --> 00:09:36.924
<v Speaker 1>person who saved who died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that takes time and effort and the </v>

141
00:09:40.621 --> 00:09:42.990
<v Speaker 1>antidepressant isn't going to interfere </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>

142
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:47.370
<v Speaker 1>So it's not self evident that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to suffer themselves three quarters</v>

143
00:09:47.371 --> 00:09:51.570
<v Speaker 1>to death in order to begin the healing </v>
<v Speaker 1>process post grief,</v>

144
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.920
<v Speaker 1>but conscious also very helpful </v>
<v Speaker 1>directly.</v>

145
00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.700
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things I recommend to </v>
<v Speaker 1>my clients who are grieving is that they</v>

146
00:09:59.701 --> 00:10:03.780
<v Speaker 1>go get massages because it's comforting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

147
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.840
<v Speaker 1>that direct human to human contact </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually has a antique grief effect.</v>

148
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.330
<v Speaker 1>So all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

149
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:17.540
<v Speaker 1>the Buddha grows up in this beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive,</v>

150
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:22.320
<v Speaker 1>safe place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But of course he'd be,</v>

151
00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:26.250
<v Speaker 1>he develops into adolescence that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>them curious.</v>

152
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:27.084
<v Speaker 1>And so he notices more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciously the existence of the walls </v>

153
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.180
<v Speaker 1>and starts to wonder what's outside.</v>

154
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.533
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

155
00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:40.240
<v Speaker 1>And so he starts to play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets farther.</v>

156
00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:44.230
<v Speaker 1>He wants to go out and he wants to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and he wants to go out.</v>

157
00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.093
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's a developmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>story too because that's exactly what </v>

158
00:10:47.381 --> 00:10:48.940
<v Speaker 1>happens with children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

159
00:10:48.941 --> 00:10:49.774
<v Speaker 1>Is that once they hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh it's probably 11 something like that </v>

160
00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.593
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean even at for their orientation </v>

161
00:10:57.341 --> 00:11:02.341
<v Speaker 1>starts to move away from the parental </v>
<v Speaker 1>unit out to the social community.</v>

162
00:11:02.591 --> 00:11:06.430
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>a child should be socialized</v>

163
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:11.083
<v Speaker 1>with regards to his or her ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with nonfamilial with people </v>

164
00:11:15.651 --> 00:11:19.130
<v Speaker 1>who aren't part of the family between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ages of two and four.</v>

165
00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.800
<v Speaker 1>So at two a child is still pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>egocentric.</v>

166
00:11:21.801 --> 00:11:24.410
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for them to play with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

167
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.610
<v Speaker 1>They can play beside them and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

168
00:11:26.611 --> 00:11:27.444
<v Speaker 1>they can play to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two year olds are actually often quite </v>

169
00:11:29.721 --> 00:11:32.360
<v Speaker 1>good at playing with babies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite interesting.</v>

170
00:11:32.361 --> 00:11:33.194
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be part of their inbuilt </v>

171
00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:35.390
<v Speaker 1>capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

172
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:41.230
<v Speaker 1>but between two and four they have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn complicated lessons.</v>

173
00:11:41.841 --> 00:11:43.970
<v Speaker 1>Like how to share.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough one.</v>

174
00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:47.270
<v Speaker 1>And because it kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

175
00:11:47.271 --> 00:11:50.180
<v Speaker 1>it involves taking the place of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other person to some degree.</v>

176
00:11:50.181 --> 00:11:52.310
<v Speaker 1>But it also involves comprehending the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

177
00:11:52.311 --> 00:11:55.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that if you lend something out,</v>

178
00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:57.520
<v Speaker 1>someone else can play with it and you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it back.</v>

179
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.100
<v Speaker 1>And that'll be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a complicated one.</v>

180
00:12:00.101 --> 00:12:04.540
<v Speaker 1>And then they also have to learn how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiate a script,</v>

181
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:07.330
<v Speaker 1>which is a ridiculously important thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to learn,</v>

182
00:12:07.331 --> 00:12:08.164
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

183
00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:13.960
<v Speaker 1>they can either do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>formally when they play,</v>

184
00:12:13.961 --> 00:12:14.794
<v Speaker 1>say a board game that has rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a simple board game or a game like </v>

185
00:12:17.411 --> 00:12:22.411
<v Speaker 1>marbles that actually has rules to which</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to subordinate themselves.</v>

186
00:12:23.411 --> 00:12:24.244
<v Speaker 1>So basically what's happening is they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving from a egocentric perspective </v>

187
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:30.880
<v Speaker 1>where they're only playing their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>game under the guys,</v>

188
00:12:30.881 --> 00:12:31.714
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under the control of their own </v>

189
00:12:32.111 --> 00:12:34.220
<v Speaker 1>motivational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

190
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.073
<v Speaker 1>structures to playing a game that two </v>
<v Speaker 1>people or more conjoined into under the </v>

191
00:12:40.031 --> 00:12:43.430
<v Speaker 1>rubric of a higher order system of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of rules and goals.</v>

192
00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:47.890
<v Speaker 1>So what they're basically doing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning to subordinate their motive,</v>

193
00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:48.813
<v Speaker 1>individual motivational states to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>state of being that allows multiple </v>

194
00:12:52.751 --> 00:12:56.110
<v Speaker 1>people to integrate their motivational </v>
<v Speaker 1>and emotional states across time.</v>

195
00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:57.490
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very sophisticated,</v>

196
00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.430
<v Speaker 1>very complicated thing to learn how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

197
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:03.010
<v Speaker 1>And then of course they also learn how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>

198
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:04.773
<v Speaker 1>how to pretend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>play and pretend and play is far more </v>

199
00:13:07.781 --> 00:13:12.700
<v Speaker 1>important than people generally realize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The typical pretend script will be,</v>

200
00:13:12.701 --> 00:13:14.650
<v Speaker 1>there's a number of kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

201
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:15.633
<v Speaker 1>two or more and they're going to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to have a little dramatic </v>

202
00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:20.613
<v Speaker 1>episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe they're going to play house </v>

203
00:13:21.881 --> 00:13:24.850
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they're all assigned roles.</v>

204
00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:25.953
<v Speaker 1>That's all from mutual agreement and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then the kids basically negotiate what </v>

205
00:13:29.351 --> 00:13:32.410
<v Speaker 1>the script is going to be and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>play it out.</v>

206
00:13:32.411 --> 00:13:33.730
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a form of thinking,</v>

207
00:13:33.731 --> 00:13:34.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

208
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.133
<v Speaker 1>it's a form of embodied thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's really interesting about it </v>

209
00:13:39.071 --> 00:13:39.904
<v Speaker 1>is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to agree on the structure of </v>

210
00:13:45.521 --> 00:13:46.870
<v Speaker 1>the gay man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the roles.</v>

211
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:47.793
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you negotiate with adults for the </v>

212
00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:52.060
<v Speaker 1>rest of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in an intimate relationship,</v>

213
00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:54.250
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what you're going to do.</v>

214
00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:56.050
<v Speaker 1>If you're negotiating properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

215
00:13:56.051 --> 00:13:56.884
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we want to have happen here in </v>

216
00:13:58.691 --> 00:14:03.640
<v Speaker 1>this space that we share and how are we </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to conduct ourselves mutually?</v>

217
00:14:03.641 --> 00:14:07.780
<v Speaker 1>So that occurs and people are really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really not good at that,</v>

218
00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.840
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it is an extended form of play.</v>

219
00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.500
<v Speaker 1>And if the relationship is going well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's all,</v>

220
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.393
<v Speaker 1>there's an element of play in it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things that makes it </v>

221
00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.770
<v Speaker 1>enjoyable instead of just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

222
00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:26.850
<v Speaker 1>tyranny and necessity so well so the </v>
<v Speaker 1>child starts to move out into the world.</v>

223
00:14:29.021 --> 00:14:31.510
<v Speaker 1>But that increases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

224
00:14:31.511 --> 00:14:32.344
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

225
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:35.110
<v Speaker 1>the voyage length in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>increases.</v>

226
00:14:35.111 --> 00:14:35.944
<v Speaker 1>Cause the other thing children do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is often but not always with </v>

227
00:14:38.771 --> 00:14:39.604
<v Speaker 1>their mothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they use her as a marker of defined </v>

228
00:14:43.451 --> 00:14:44.284
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the easiest way to think </v>

229
00:14:45.791 --> 00:14:46.624
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they screwed out from that </v>

230
00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:52.580
<v Speaker 1>marker and do some exploring until get </v>
<v Speaker 1>tired or overwhelmed.</v>

231
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:56.150
<v Speaker 1>Then they come back and they get </v>
<v Speaker 1>comforted and pat and you know,</v>

232
00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.103
<v Speaker 1>put back into a routine and then they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>all put back together and then they go </v>

233
00:15:00.471 --> 00:15:03.170
<v Speaker 1>out next time a little bit farther and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they run batch.</v>

234
00:15:03.171 --> 00:15:04.004
<v Speaker 1>And so a big chunk of what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a parent is not so much 24 seven </v>

235
00:15:08.751 --> 00:15:09.584
<v Speaker 1>monitoring as making yourself available </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a resource when the child deems </v>

236
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:16.783
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's part of why it's useful to be </v>

237
00:15:18.681 --> 00:15:20.270
<v Speaker 1>around and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

238
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.193
<v Speaker 1>if you're a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your place can be taken by another </v>

239
00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:25.940
<v Speaker 1>adult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's only true really.</v>

240
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:27.583
<v Speaker 1>If the child knows the adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like children can make multiple parent </v>

241
00:15:31.631 --> 00:15:32.464
<v Speaker 1>like bonds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one thing they hate is having their </v>

242
00:15:35.661 --> 00:15:39.150
<v Speaker 1>primary caregiver changed because that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the primary caregivers,</v>

243
00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:41.450
<v Speaker 1>their whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when you change that on them,</v>

244
00:15:41.451 --> 00:15:42.284
<v Speaker 1>you just flip them upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they can tolerate multiple </v>

245
00:15:45.561 --> 00:15:46.394
<v Speaker 1>caregivers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have a really rough time </v>

246
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:54.250
<v Speaker 1>tolerating transitions in child</v>
<v Speaker 1>care givers,</v>

247
00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:59.680
<v Speaker 1>especially the younger they are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst that is so well then you know,</v>

248
00:16:00.021 --> 00:16:02.990
<v Speaker 1>as the child progresses towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>adolescence,</v>

249
00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:08.020
<v Speaker 1>then there's another burst of </v>
<v Speaker 1>independent seeking activity pretty much</v>

250
00:16:08.781 --> 00:16:11.150
<v Speaker 1>at puberty for obvious reasons.</v>

251
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:12.643
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when the child is going to turn </v>

252
00:16:15.501 --> 00:16:20.330
<v Speaker 1>their attention almost entirely to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fitting into the social world.</v>

253
00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.790
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a form of apprenticeship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about that earlier in class.</v>

254
00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:26.533
<v Speaker 1>So you can think the child goes from </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependence to like dependence on the </v>

255
00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:36.950
<v Speaker 1>familial structure to interdependence </v>
<v Speaker 1>with other children.</v>

256
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:38.713
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that sort of would transform </v>

257
00:16:40.731 --> 00:16:45.731
<v Speaker 1>into in culturation and the development </v>
<v Speaker 1>of an idea of a cultural identity.</v>

258
00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.353
<v Speaker 1>And then perhaps there's a stage past </v>
<v Speaker 1>that where morality is defined as </v>

259
00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:56.060
<v Speaker 1>something outside of pure cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>identification.</v>

260
00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:00.570
<v Speaker 1>And that would be something more akin to</v>
<v Speaker 1>an individuation.</v>

261
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:07.210
<v Speaker 1>And that's the stage at which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a pay as Jedi and idea,</v>

262
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:13.150
<v Speaker 1>the person recognizes themselves as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>creator and modifier of rules as well as</v>

263
00:17:14.091 --> 00:17:14.924
<v Speaker 1>a follower and adherence of rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can even think to some degree </v>

264
00:17:20.751 --> 00:17:24.990
<v Speaker 1>that the divide between conservative and</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal is a divide if that sort,</v>

265
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:25.843
<v Speaker 1>now the mapping isn't precise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the conservatives tend to be low in </v>

266
00:17:29.361 --> 00:17:31.460
<v Speaker 1>openness and high in conscientiousness.</v>

267
00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.400
<v Speaker 1>So they're not that interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation.</v>

268
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:35.653
<v Speaker 1>They're interested in maintaining the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules of the game and doing well within </v>

269
00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:42.680
<v Speaker 1>that set of rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the liberals position is,</v>

270
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:43.543
<v Speaker 1>well sometimes the lip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rules themselves need to be altered </v>

271
00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:51.180
<v Speaker 1>and so you can't blindly accept the game</v>
<v Speaker 1>and follow it.</v>

272
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:54.100
<v Speaker 1>You have to be willing to adjust it when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's necessary.</v>

273
00:17:54.101 --> 00:17:57.450
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a constant tension </v>
<v Speaker 1>between those two positions.</v>

274
00:17:57.451 --> 00:18:01.670
<v Speaker 1>That's somewhat like the tension between</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was cyrus and horrors.</v>

275
00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:07.710
<v Speaker 1>If it's all conservative than things </v>
<v Speaker 1>stultify and that's not good because the</v>

276
00:18:07.711 --> 00:18:12.480
<v Speaker 1>world changes and if your static </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural system doesn't change,</v>

277
00:18:12.481 --> 00:18:16.200
<v Speaker 1>then it falls by the wayside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the Conservatives would say,</v>

278
00:18:16.201 --> 00:18:20.040
<v Speaker 1>well don't be changing more things than </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to because all you do is invite</v>

279
00:18:20.041 --> 00:18:20.874
<v Speaker 1>chaos in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say in some sense that </v>

280
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:25.013
<v Speaker 1>there's a pant on both sides of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>political continuum and the pit on the </v>

281
00:18:29.161 --> 00:18:34.161
<v Speaker 1>conservative side is stultification and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pit on the liberal side is chaos.</v>

282
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:36.283
<v Speaker 1>And so the whole polity is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>continually maneuver between chaos and </v>

283
00:18:39.991 --> 00:18:40.824
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way you do that isn't by having </v>

284
00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:43.914
<v Speaker 1>the Liberals or the Conservatives win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way you do that is by having the </v>

285
00:18:46.981 --> 00:18:51.981
<v Speaker 1>Liberals and conservatives talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as they can't talk,</v>

286
00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:53.214
<v Speaker 1>then there's trouble because they both </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand for principle that can't be </v>

287
00:18:56.731 --> 00:18:58.500
<v Speaker 1>abandoned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

288
00:18:58.501 --> 00:18:59.334
<v Speaker 1>and because the balance between chaos </v>
<v Speaker 1>and order shifts with time as the </v>

289
00:19:04.051 --> 00:19:04.884
<v Speaker 1>environment shifts awake and aware,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have to continually negotiate to </v>

290
00:19:09.901 --> 00:19:10.734
<v Speaker 1>determine exactly where that line is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not in the same place all </v>

291
00:19:13.501 --> 00:19:15.150
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

292
00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.500
<v Speaker 1>and that's not going so well at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

293
00:19:19.501 --> 00:19:20.334
<v Speaker 1>especially in the u s you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not good and who knows what will </v>

294
00:19:25.261 --> 00:19:27.270
<v Speaker 1>come of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's definitely not good.</v>

295
00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:28.883
<v Speaker 1>So all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that by the time you know a child is </v>

296
00:19:32.221 --> 00:19:33.054
<v Speaker 1>adolescent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's a fair bit of impetus to </v>

297
00:19:35.611 --> 00:19:40.611
<v Speaker 1>move out into the world beyond the </v>
<v Speaker 1>confines of the familial structure.</v>

298
00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that doesn't happen,</v>

299
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:49.100
<v Speaker 1>then generally you could infer that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the child has not had it easy.</v>

300
00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.353
<v Speaker 1>Either the child is quite dependent in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of its fundamental temperament or </v>

301
00:19:55.051 --> 00:19:59.160
<v Speaker 1>that its independence has not been </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly fostered by the parents.</v>

302
00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.013
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

303
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:05.220
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

304
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.130
<v Speaker 1>there was literature now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I haven't looked into this for,</v>

305
00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:09.093
<v Speaker 1>it's probably 20 years now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was literature that I was </v>

306
00:20:10.951 --> 00:20:14.280
<v Speaker 1>aware of when I was doing research on </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug and alcohol abuse,</v>

307
00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:19.350
<v Speaker 1>that there were two populations at risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at how children,</v>

308
00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:20.483
<v Speaker 1>adolescents use drug and alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs and alcohol in junior high and </v>

309
00:20:23.371 --> 00:20:25.500
<v Speaker 1>high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were two populations at risk.</v>

310
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:26.783
<v Speaker 1>One population was those who </v>
<v Speaker 1>experimented with everything and used </v>

311
00:20:30.481 --> 00:20:31.314
<v Speaker 1>everything to an access and all you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't take much description to </v>

312
00:20:35.671 --> 00:20:39.050
<v Speaker 1>understand where that might lead to </v>
<v Speaker 1>antisocial behavior and,</v>

313
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:39.953
<v Speaker 1>and whatever damage you might accrue by </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulating your socialization around </v>

314
00:20:44.101 --> 00:20:44.934
<v Speaker 1>alcohol for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the other group that was in trouble </v>

315
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:52.030
<v Speaker 1>with those kids who never experimented </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it was,</v>

316
00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:52.983
<v Speaker 1>you've got two kinds of pathologies </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and one pathology was a chaos </v>

317
00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:57.430
<v Speaker 1>pathology basically.</v>

318
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:59.290
<v Speaker 1>And the other one was an order </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathology.</v>

319
00:20:59.291 --> 00:21:03.370
<v Speaker 1>And the kids in the middle were ones who</v>
<v Speaker 1>had experimented to some degree.</v>

320
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.473
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because partly what adolescents are </v>

321
00:21:06.581 --> 00:21:10.420
<v Speaker 1>doing this poking the social world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world of law,</v>

322
00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:14.270
<v Speaker 1>really to see where its contours are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

323
00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:15.123
<v Speaker 1>cause part of the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well is it necessary for me to follow </v>

324
00:21:18.341 --> 00:21:19.174
<v Speaker 1>these rules?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can't be told that you have to </v>

325
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:28.930
<v Speaker 1>experiment and see what the necessity is</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the rule following.</v>

326
00:21:28.931 --> 00:21:31.630
<v Speaker 1>And that means that your parents have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>allow you,</v>

327
00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:35.110
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of freedom that</v>

328
00:21:35.111 --> 00:21:39.070
<v Speaker 1>you need to be allowed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least that's one way of looking at</v>

329
00:21:39.071 --> 00:21:39.904
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's at least some freedom that </v>

330
00:21:42.881 --> 00:21:43.714
<v Speaker 1>you have to be allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the goal of parenting is the </v>

331
00:21:46.451 --> 00:21:51.010
<v Speaker 1>production of someone who's capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking care of themselves.</v>

332
00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:52.683
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

333
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:55.990
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious that that's always the </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal of parenting,</v>

334
00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:56.913
<v Speaker 1>because some cultures are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>interdependent and there's no necessary </v>

335
00:22:00.761 --> 00:22:05.761
<v Speaker 1>presumption on the part of the parents </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the person is going to live.</v>

336
00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:10.930
<v Speaker 1>The person is going to have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of living in a fully independent</v>

337
00:22:10.931 --> 00:22:12.340
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

338
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:14.913
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what happens is the king's son gets </v>

339
00:22:17.111 --> 00:22:20.820
<v Speaker 1>curious now at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he also has a,</v>

340
00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:24.040
<v Speaker 1>a retainer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy who is with them all the time,</v>

341
00:22:24.041 --> 00:22:25.870
<v Speaker 1>who's teaching and things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

342
00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:30.750
<v Speaker 1>the gods had got wind of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the father's plan,</v>

343
00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:34.000
<v Speaker 1>and decided that they weren't going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make things as simple as he wanted it to</v>

344
00:22:34.001 --> 00:22:37.570
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the retainer is an agent of the gods.</v>

345
00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:41.830
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's always whispering in the,</v>

346
00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:44.290
<v Speaker 1>in the son's ear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well anyways,</v>

347
00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:45.813
<v Speaker 1>Buddha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the future Buddha gets curious and </v>

348
00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:51.400
<v Speaker 1>decides I'm going out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going out there.</v>

349
00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:55.960
<v Speaker 1>And so his father realizes that some </v>
<v Speaker 1>point that there's just no way that he's</v>

350
00:22:55.961 --> 00:23:00.250
<v Speaker 1>going to be able to be kept inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he pulls a fast one,</v>

351
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:02.223
<v Speaker 1>it goes out to the city surrounding the </v>
<v Speaker 1>walled city to the area surrounding the </v>

352
00:23:05.711 --> 00:23:06.544
<v Speaker 1>walled city.</v>

353
00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:07.533
<v Speaker 1>And he chases away all the homeless </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and he chases away all the </v>

354
00:23:10.481 --> 00:23:11.314
<v Speaker 1>elderly people and he chases away all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sick people and he has everybody </v>

355
00:23:14.411 --> 00:23:16.900
<v Speaker 1>spruce everything up so that it's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect shape.</v>

356
00:23:16.901 --> 00:23:17.734
<v Speaker 1>And then he aligns the streets that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddhists carriage is going to go </v>

357
00:23:21.341 --> 00:23:25.060
<v Speaker 1>through with the most attractive people </v>
<v Speaker 1>he can find all cheering.</v>

358
00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:30.130
<v Speaker 1>And so one day they opened the gates and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Buddha rides out in his,</v>

359
00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.630
<v Speaker 1>in his chariot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his cart and his,</v>

360
00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:35.450
<v Speaker 1>his retainer is behind them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

361
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:37.110
<v Speaker 1>they go down the streets and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddhist,</v>

362
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.370
<v Speaker 1>they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just a final day.</v>

363
00:23:39.371 --> 00:23:40.204
<v Speaker 1>And then someone who's ill wanders out </v>
<v Speaker 1>onto the road in front of him and he's </v>

364
00:23:45.831 --> 00:23:47.120
<v Speaker 1>looking pretty rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

365
00:23:47.121 --> 00:23:51.410
<v Speaker 1>he's very sick and it's evident just by </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at him that things are not going</v>

366
00:23:51.411 --> 00:23:54.530
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what the Buddhist stops his</v>

367
00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.230
<v Speaker 1>chariot and the shock watching this </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

368
00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:58.143
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stumble across the road and he asks his </v>

369
00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.780
<v Speaker 1>retainer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell's going on here?</v>

370
00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:05.420
<v Speaker 1>And the retainer says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

371
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:08.930
<v Speaker 1>you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this person is ill and he's,</v>

372
00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:11.030
<v Speaker 1>he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something has gone wrong with him.</v>

373
00:24:11.031 --> 00:24:15.920
<v Speaker 1>He's not functioning well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And illness is the law of mankind and it</v>

374
00:24:15.921 --> 00:24:16.754
<v Speaker 1>happens to everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the Buddhists not very happy </v>

375
00:24:18.801 --> 00:24:21.500
<v Speaker 1>about that piece of information and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bang,</v>

376
00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:22.334
<v Speaker 1>he goes back into the walled city and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just like he's running back to </v>

377
00:24:27.351 --> 00:24:29.060
<v Speaker 1>his mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

378
00:24:29.061 --> 00:24:30.710
<v Speaker 1>It's the same idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

379
00:24:30.711 --> 00:24:32.540
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a piece of information.</v>

380
00:24:32.541 --> 00:24:33.374
<v Speaker 1>He's just being offered an anomalous </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of information that's sufficient </v>

381
00:24:37.911 --> 00:24:41.560
<v Speaker 1>to shatter the structure of some of his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

382
00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:44.990
<v Speaker 1>his value hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

383
00:24:44.991 --> 00:24:45.824
<v Speaker 1>Back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

384
00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:47.373
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it takes them like six months to </v>

385
00:24:48.051 --> 00:24:51.110
<v Speaker 1>digest that piece of information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he manages it.</v>

386
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:54.290
<v Speaker 1>And then his curiosity starts to grow </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

387
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:58.370
<v Speaker 1>And so he starts harassing is farther </v>
<v Speaker 1>again about going outside again.</v>

388
00:24:58.371 --> 00:25:00.170
<v Speaker 1>So the father tries to pull the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>trick,</v>

389
00:25:00.171 --> 00:25:01.700
<v Speaker 1>but he's extra careful this time.</v>

390
00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:02.893
<v Speaker 1>He makes sure all the sick people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>rounded up and put somewhere where no </v>

391
00:25:05.061 --> 00:25:05.894
<v Speaker 1>one's going to see them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he lightens the streets again and </v>

392
00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:08.623
<v Speaker 1>the Buddha goes out and it's a beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 1>day and the streets are lined with </v>

393
00:25:12.021 --> 00:25:17.021
<v Speaker 1>cheering people and all of a sudden the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gods are involved in this.</v>

394
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:20.210
<v Speaker 1>They're playing tricks on the father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're the random,</v>

395
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.520
<v Speaker 1>that's the random uncontrollable </v>
<v Speaker 1>element,</v>

396
00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:23.354
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that's roughly </v>

397
00:25:23.961 --> 00:25:26.600
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to the snake in the garden of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eden.</v>

398
00:25:26.601 --> 00:25:30.110
<v Speaker 1>So it's the Buddhist curiosity that </v>
<v Speaker 1>drives him out.</v>

399
00:25:30.111 --> 00:25:30.944
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though his father tells him that </v>

400
00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:34.280
<v Speaker 1>it's his set it up so that he shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

401
00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:37.100
<v Speaker 1>And when he goes out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anomalous thing,</v>

402
00:25:37.101 --> 00:25:39.100
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>occurs and fractures.</v>

403
00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:40.723
<v Speaker 1>So he goes out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this time someone who's really </v>

404
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:45.980
<v Speaker 1>agent hobbles out into the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

405
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:49.460
<v Speaker 1>all gray and wrinkled and bent over and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not move and very well.</v>

406
00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:53.090
<v Speaker 1>And the Buddha is shocked out of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind again.</v>

407
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.880
<v Speaker 1>And he says to his retainer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>

408
00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:59.150
<v Speaker 1>what's up with this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And His retainer.</v>

409
00:25:59.151 --> 00:25:59.751
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

410
00:25:59.751 --> 00:26:00.860
<v Speaker 1>you know how you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

411
00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:04.190
<v Speaker 1>going from small to larger and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>how you grow.</v>

412
00:26:04.191 --> 00:26:05.024
<v Speaker 1>Well people continue to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at some point they start to age and </v>

413
00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:13.610
<v Speaker 1>things don't go so well and event and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the law of mankind.</v>

414
00:26:13.611 --> 00:26:18.611
<v Speaker 1>And so the Buddha is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's enough fun for one day and bang,</v>

415
00:26:18.741 --> 00:26:19.574
<v Speaker 1>he goes back into the walled city and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this time he stays inside for a whole </v>

416
00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:25.850
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like the rats who go out there</v>

417
00:26:25.851 --> 00:26:27.140
<v Speaker 1>and see that cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

418
00:26:27.141 --> 00:26:30.200
<v Speaker 1>and then go back to their burrow and </v>
<v Speaker 1>scream for two weeks.</v>

419
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:34.400
<v Speaker 1>He's exactly the same idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so far in a year later,</v>

420
00:26:34.401 --> 00:26:38.810
<v Speaker 1>he's more or less put himself back </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and he decides to go out again.</v>

421
00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:44.080
<v Speaker 1>And as father pose exactly the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>trick for exactly the same reasons,</v>

422
00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.033
<v Speaker 1>but this time the butsudan encounters a </v>
<v Speaker 1>funeral procession and he can see the </v>

423
00:26:51.721 --> 00:26:52.554
<v Speaker 1>body and it's lying there still in cold </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everyone is weeping and dressed in </v>

424
00:26:57.361 --> 00:27:01.110
<v Speaker 1>black and it's a terrible situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Buddha asked his retainer,</v>

425
00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:05.370
<v Speaker 1>what's up with this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And His retainer says,</v>

426
00:27:05.371 --> 00:27:07.710
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw someone who was sick and you saw</v>

427
00:27:07.711 --> 00:27:08.544
<v Speaker 1>someone who was old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like the worst case scenario for </v>

428
00:27:11.911 --> 00:27:14.610
<v Speaker 1>both of those is death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Buddhist says,</v>

429
00:27:14.611 --> 00:27:17.460
<v Speaker 1>well what's thought?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the retainer explains to him as best</v>

430
00:27:17.461 --> 00:27:21.420
<v Speaker 1>he can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well this time this is such a shock that</v>

431
00:27:21.421 --> 00:27:26.421
<v Speaker 1>he can't even go back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the wall garden so to speak.</v>

432
00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:29.723
<v Speaker 1>So as farther,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is the sort of shock that </v>

433
00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:37.320
<v Speaker 1>completely collapses his belief and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>say infantiles paradise.</v>

434
00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:40.560
<v Speaker 1>It's the death idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's the same idea that comes up in</v>

435
00:27:40.561 --> 00:27:41.331
<v Speaker 1>genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

436
00:27:41.331 --> 00:27:42.164
<v Speaker 1>Is that when Adam and eve are driven by </v>
<v Speaker 1>their curiosity to interact with this </v>

437
00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:50.430
<v Speaker 1>snake like entity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

438
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:54.990
<v Speaker 1>their realization is one of death and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that blows paradise permanently.</v>

439
00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:56.580
<v Speaker 1>They don't go back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

440
00:27:56.581 --> 00:27:59.010
<v Speaker 1>God makes it impossible for them to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

441
00:27:59.011 --> 00:27:59.844
<v Speaker 1>which is a variation in the Buddhist </v>
<v Speaker 1>story because Buddha himself decides </v>

442
00:28:03.091 --> 00:28:07.320
<v Speaker 1>that he's not going back well as farther</v>
<v Speaker 1>has one more trick up his sleeve.</v>

443
00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:08.813
<v Speaker 1>So he calls on the most attractive women</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the kingdom to go into a forest </v>

444
00:28:13.321 --> 00:28:18.321
<v Speaker 1>nearby and to disrobe and to dance </v>
<v Speaker 1>erotically and to attract and you know,</v>

445
00:28:19.171 --> 00:28:22.020
<v Speaker 1>to bring the boat of there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to attract them back into life,</v>

446
00:28:22.021 --> 00:28:22.854
<v Speaker 1>to make him feel that the pleasures of </v>
<v Speaker 1>living are sufficient so that this </v>

447
00:28:27.331 --> 00:28:29.640
<v Speaker 1>unfortunate incident can be put behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

448
00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:30.503
<v Speaker 1>But when he goes into the forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all he can think about is the </v>

449
00:28:34.471 --> 00:28:37.520
<v Speaker 1>transformation of flesh into decay and </v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

450
00:28:37.521 --> 00:28:41.280
<v Speaker 1>And that's that done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't go home again.</v>

451
00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:46.800
<v Speaker 1>And that's what starts this journey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the next thing the Buddha does as</v>

452
00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:52.370
<v Speaker 1>he becomes an add depth at all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different disciplinary traditions,</v>

453
00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:53.753
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he becomes an ascetic and he starves </v>

454
00:28:55.471 --> 00:28:56.304
<v Speaker 1>themselves so thoroughly that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see a single grain of rice </v>

455
00:28:59.791 --> 00:29:02.280
<v Speaker 1>passed down his throat and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

456
00:29:02.281 --> 00:29:03.114
<v Speaker 1>so he puts himself through martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditions and ascetic traditions and </v>

457
00:29:06.781 --> 00:29:07.614
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of religious traditions trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to in some sense put himself back </v>

458
00:29:11.371 --> 00:29:12.204
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is that his fundamental and </v>

459
00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:16.433
<v Speaker 1>naive non self conscious early belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>system is fractured completely by his </v>

460
00:29:20.111 --> 00:29:22.380
<v Speaker 1>discovery of sickness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old age and death.</v>

461
00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:27.980
<v Speaker 1>And then as a fractured entity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he then submits himself to various forms</v>

462
00:29:30.511 --> 00:29:34.410
<v Speaker 1>of discipline trying to reconstitute </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

463
00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:36.083
<v Speaker 1>None of that really succeeds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the story ends with him going </v>

464
00:29:40.651 --> 00:29:45.250
<v Speaker 1>under a tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bodhi tree and adopting that classic</v>

465
00:29:45.251 --> 00:29:46.084
<v Speaker 1>boot oppose and trying to attain </v>
<v Speaker 1>lightman enlightenment through </v>

466
00:29:49.331 --> 00:29:52.930
<v Speaker 1>meditation and self examination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he actually manages to do.</v>

467
00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:57.250
<v Speaker 1>And then he attains enlightenment and is</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a state of Nirvana,</v>

468
00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:00.730
<v Speaker 1>but decides that he can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

469
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.480
<v Speaker 1>he decides that it's immoral to stay in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

470
00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:09.310
<v Speaker 1>mode of being unless everybody can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

471
00:30:09.311 --> 00:30:10.144
<v Speaker 1>So he leaves Nervana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in some senses it's final </v>

472
00:30:12.401 --> 00:30:13.234
<v Speaker 1>temptation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He leaves Nirvana and then goes out and </v>

473
00:30:15.011 --> 00:30:19.300
<v Speaker 1>starts to teach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the story of the Buddha.</v>

474
00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.273
<v Speaker 1>So now you know the off the most obscure</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of that is what happens underneath </v>

475
00:30:25.931 --> 00:30:27.740
<v Speaker 1>the bow tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

476
00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.770
<v Speaker 1>Now there's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an,</v>

477
00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:35.420
<v Speaker 1>there's also an analog between that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens in the,</v>

478
00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:39.290
<v Speaker 1>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>

479
00:30:39.291 --> 00:30:40.124
<v Speaker 1>and narrative of Christianity because </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens with Christ is that his </v>

480
00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:49.930
<v Speaker 1>identity with God is fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifested when he ends up on a tree.</v>

481
00:30:49.931 --> 00:30:50.830
<v Speaker 1>It's different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

482
00:30:50.831 --> 00:30:55.831
<v Speaker 1>Because there's a crucifixion on a tree </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it is regarded as a tree in a,</v>

483
00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:59.830
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the mythological tradition.</v>

484
00:30:59.831 --> 00:31:04.831
<v Speaker 1>So there's an idea in symbolic </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity that Christ is crucified</v>

485
00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:09.883
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

486
00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:11.163
<v Speaker 1>on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the same tree where Adam discovered </v>

487
00:31:13.811 --> 00:31:17.020
<v Speaker 1>that he was going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a reason for that.</v>

488
00:31:17.021 --> 00:31:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason fundamentally is that,</v>

489
00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:22.513
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

490
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:27.630
<v Speaker 1>both genesis and the story of the Buddha</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the proposition that it's this,</v>

491
00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:28.870
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

492
00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:30.540
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

493
00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:34.180
<v Speaker 1>ultimate extension of self consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

494
00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:39.790
<v Speaker 1>devastates people existentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the discovery of death,</v>

495
00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:41.350
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not just that,</v>

496
00:31:41.351 --> 00:31:42.000
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

497
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:42.833
<v Speaker 1>it's vulnerability per say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just death because there are </v>

498
00:31:45.641 --> 00:31:50.641
<v Speaker 1>worse things than death and that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>that discovery of ultimate vulnerability</v>

499
00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:55.000
<v Speaker 1>that turns people into the creatures </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they are.</v>

500
00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:58.240
<v Speaker 1>And that one response to that is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>build culture,</v>

501
00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:00.070
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what happens with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddha.</v>

502
00:32:00.071 --> 00:32:01.930
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trevor's has multiple cultures,</v>

503
00:32:01.931 --> 00:32:02.764
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Becoming a master of many specific sub </v>

504
00:32:05.311 --> 00:32:06.144
<v Speaker 1>cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens in the old </v>

505
00:32:07.961 --> 00:32:08.794
<v Speaker 1>testament is that after the fall and </v>
<v Speaker 1>after the story of Adam and eve and </v>

506
00:32:12.551 --> 00:32:13.384
<v Speaker 1>after the story of Noah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are all that really before the </v>

507
00:32:15.671 --> 00:32:18.190
<v Speaker 1>flood story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are the really ancient stories.</v>

508
00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:19.263
<v Speaker 1>Then you fall into history and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the continual creation and destruction </v>

509
00:32:23.261 --> 00:32:24.940
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Israel lights,</v>

510
00:32:24.941 --> 00:32:28.080
<v Speaker 1>states and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

511
00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:31.660
<v Speaker 1>then there's a break in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>between Judaism and Christianity.</v>

512
00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:34.000
<v Speaker 1>And it's an interesting break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

513
00:32:34.001 --> 00:32:35.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm no expert in Judaism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Aye.</v>

514
00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:37.140
<v Speaker 1>Aye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aye.</v>

515
00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:38.133
<v Speaker 1>I think I've got this basically right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the Christians make a decision </v>

516
00:32:44.421 --> 00:32:48.260
<v Speaker 1>that whatever Christ represented was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>solution to the problem,</v>

517
00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.273
<v Speaker 1>not only of emergent self consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>but also for the insufficiency of </v>

518
00:32:54.111 --> 00:32:54.944
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because remember you get an empire </v>

519
00:32:57.231 --> 00:32:58.064
<v Speaker 1>building and collapsing and then empire </v>
<v Speaker 1>building and collapsing and an empire </v>

520
00:33:01.251 --> 00:33:03.340
<v Speaker 1>building and collapsing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

521
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:06.890
<v Speaker 1>one answer to that is a bigger and </v>
<v Speaker 1>better empire.</v>

522
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:08.203
<v Speaker 1>And another answer is there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong with the idea of empire as a </v>

523
00:33:11.931 --> 00:33:12.764
<v Speaker 1>solution to the initial problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that the Jews and the </v>

524
00:33:16.401 --> 00:33:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Christians basically split on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition.</v>

525
00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:21.050
<v Speaker 1>And so that's partly why,</v>

526
00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:26.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean from the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the</v>

527
00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.340
<v Speaker 1>position of Judaism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there may still be a messiah buddy,</v>

528
00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.440
<v Speaker 1>but that person is not someone who's yet</v>
<v Speaker 1>appeared.</v>

529
00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:35.323
<v Speaker 1>And then there's another proposition </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the state itself is redemptive </v>

530
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.903
<v Speaker 1>and that's played out at least in part </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Israel where the state is viewed as </v>

531
00:33:43.821 --> 00:33:44.654
<v Speaker 1>redemptive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that things will go well for the Jewish </v>

532
00:33:46.071 --> 00:33:46.904
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If an only if they can establish a </v>

533
00:33:48.441 --> 00:33:50.120
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

534
00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.550
<v Speaker 1>a skeptic would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

535
00:33:52.551 --> 00:33:55.850
<v Speaker 1>but all the things that the state was </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to keep out,</v>

536
00:33:55.851 --> 00:33:56.684
<v Speaker 1>start cropping up inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that you have to be rather </v>

537
00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:03.860
<v Speaker 1>blind not to see that that's happened to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a large degree in Israel.</v>

538
00:34:03.861 --> 00:34:05.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's happened,</v>

539
00:34:05.451 --> 00:34:08.960
<v Speaker 1>forget about the Palestinians and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabs for the time being,</v>

540
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:10.303
<v Speaker 1>but even with in Judaism itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a major fracture between the </v>

541
00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:16.460
<v Speaker 1>more orthodox Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones who are very,</v>

542
00:34:16.461 --> 00:34:17.294
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very conservative in their beliefs and </v>

543
00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:22.760
<v Speaker 1>habits and the more secular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

544
00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Westernized Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

545
00:34:24.411 --> 00:34:25.244
<v Speaker 1>it's some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the distinction between right wing </v>

546
00:34:26.931 --> 00:34:28.550
<v Speaker 1>and left wing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's been,</v>

547
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:29.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very,</v>

548
00:34:29.481 --> 00:34:34.340
<v Speaker 1>very dire advisive divisive battle </v>
<v Speaker 1>within Israel.</v>

549
00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:35.443
<v Speaker 1>And what it shows in part is that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because you establish a state </v>

550
00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:41.463
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean you can assume that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of homogeneity that will eliminate </v>

551
00:34:44.241 --> 00:34:45.074
<v Speaker 1>conflict will then rain within that </v>
<v Speaker 1>state because people within the state </v>

552
00:34:48.951 --> 00:34:49.784
<v Speaker 1>can fragment into different groups just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like states themselves can be </v>

553
00:34:52.881 --> 00:34:54.590
<v Speaker 1>representative of other groups.</v>

554
00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:57.660
<v Speaker 3>Now the,</v>

555
00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:01.860
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the symbolic meaning I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

556
00:35:01.861 --> 00:35:04.080
<v Speaker 1>or the psychological meaning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity,</v>

557
00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.273
<v Speaker 1>the idea is that the answer to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathology of the state is the constant </v>

558
00:35:10.711 --> 00:35:12.960
<v Speaker 1>renewal of the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

559
00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:15.620
<v Speaker 3>that that</v>

560
00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:19.150
<v Speaker 1>falls into alignment with the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>death and rebirth.</v>

561
00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:22.330
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if the problem is the balance between</v>

562
00:35:22.331 --> 00:35:25.840
<v Speaker 1>chaos and order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both at the state level and the,</v>

563
00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:27.850
<v Speaker 1>and the individual level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

564
00:35:27.851 --> 00:35:28.684
<v Speaker 1>well where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where should action take place in order </v>

565
00:35:32.141 --> 00:35:33.820
<v Speaker 1>to redeem the state?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

566
00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:36.280
<v Speaker 1>I would say that the central Western </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>

567
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:38.610
<v Speaker 1>and this is something emerged out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity,</v>

568
00:35:38.611 --> 00:35:39.444
<v Speaker 1>was that the way to transform the state </v>
<v Speaker 1>is through the transformation of the </v>

569
00:35:42.991 --> 00:35:46.350
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So rather than the other way around,</v>

570
00:35:46.351 --> 00:35:49.350
<v Speaker 1>which is you transform the state and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hope all the individuals follow,</v>

571
00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:50.363
<v Speaker 1>we tried that for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Soviet Union because you could </v>

572
00:35:52.501 --> 00:35:53.334
<v Speaker 1>say that the communist experiment was </v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely the attempt to modify the </v>

573
00:35:59.161 --> 00:36:01.230
<v Speaker 1>state so that the individuals would </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow.</v>

574
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Now I've been reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just bought a new book,</v>

575
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:07.583
<v Speaker 1>very cheerful book called the Black Book</v>
<v Speaker 1>of communism and it was published in </v>

576
00:36:11.761 --> 00:36:12.594
<v Speaker 1>France in 1999 and the fact that it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>published in France is particularly </v>

577
00:36:15.931 --> 00:36:20.130
<v Speaker 1>interesting because of all the European </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries with the possible exception of</v>

578
00:36:20.131 --> 00:36:20.964
<v Speaker 1>Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>communists had the largest sway over </v>

579
00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:26.430
<v Speaker 1>especially intellectual life.</v>

580
00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:28.073
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say that the life of </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals in France after World War </v>

581
00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:37.320
<v Speaker 1>II was overwhelmingly radically left </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

582
00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:39.750
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not just to have the socialist type,</v>

583
00:36:39.751 --> 00:36:41.480
<v Speaker 1>but of the communist hype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean both,</v>

584
00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:46.610
<v Speaker 1>both Italy and France had communist </v>
<v Speaker 1>parties and the French intellectuals,</v>

585
00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:47.903
<v Speaker 1>including people like Sartre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were sergeant never did belong to the </v>

586
00:36:52.801 --> 00:36:53.634
<v Speaker 1>communist party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was a supporter of the Communist </v>

587
00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:56.543
<v Speaker 1>Party and all the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the French thinkers that are </v>

588
00:36:59.161 --> 00:37:00.420
<v Speaker 1>worshiped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

589
00:37:00.421 --> 00:37:01.254
<v Speaker 1>in universities today were all radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>left wingers who were involved in the </v>

590
00:37:04.381 --> 00:37:09.381
<v Speaker 1>student riots in 1968 and their beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 1>were tantamount to communistic</v>

591
00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:16.040
<v Speaker 1>and that's not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this book was written by people,</v>

592
00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:19.820
<v Speaker 1>many of whom were former French </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual communists.</v>

593
00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:20.923
<v Speaker 1>And it was written in 1999 and I read </v>
<v Speaker 1>the foreword and two of the chapters </v>

594
00:37:23.661 --> 00:37:25.460
<v Speaker 1>last night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

595
00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:27.913
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that the person who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote the foreword claims is that it </v>

596
00:37:31.431 --> 00:37:36.080
<v Speaker 1>wasn't possible to do a real analysis of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the historical significance of communism</v>

597
00:37:36.081 --> 00:37:39.320
<v Speaker 1>until 1999 until basically the end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the century.</v>

598
00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:40.543
<v Speaker 1>Because what the Communists had done was</v>
<v Speaker 1>so obscure and so secret that there was </v>

599
00:37:44.931 --> 00:37:45.764
<v Speaker 1>no way to discover it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought that's complete rubbish </v>

600
00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:53.560
<v Speaker 1>because by 1945 or there abouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Orwell was already writing animal</v>

601
00:37:54.801 --> 00:37:57.530
<v Speaker 1>farm and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he wrote,</v>

602
00:37:57.550 --> 00:38:00.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1984 in 1948,</v>

603
00:38:00.381 --> 00:38:01.214
<v Speaker 1>he just reversed the last letters and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew perfectly well what was happening </v>

604
00:38:03.861 --> 00:38:06.720
<v Speaker 1>in the communist countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if your eyes were open,</v>

605
00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:07.573
<v Speaker 1>I would say by 1935,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could tell because that's more or </v>

606
00:38:11.391 --> 00:38:13.370
<v Speaker 1>less in the midst of the Ukrainian </v>
<v Speaker 1>famine,</v>

607
00:38:13.371 --> 00:38:15.680
<v Speaker 1>which killed some four to 6 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

608
00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:18.950
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

609
00:38:18.951 --> 00:38:19.784
<v Speaker 1>so there was the 30s then things were </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated by the fact of the Second </v>

610
00:38:23.601 --> 00:38:25.580
<v Speaker 1>World War because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

611
00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:26.803
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the radical left was fighting against </v>

612
00:38:28.791 --> 00:38:29.420
<v Speaker 1>fascism.</v>

613
00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:30.253
<v Speaker 1>Say in Spain to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and lots of European and American </v>

614
00:38:33.321 --> 00:38:34.154
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals went to Spain to against </v>
<v Speaker 1>Franco and ended up on the side roughly </v>

615
00:38:37.631 --> 00:38:38.464
<v Speaker 1>speaking of the communists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that complicated things because the </v>

616
00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Frankel faction where it's definitely </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad news.</v>

617
00:38:44.651 --> 00:38:45.484
<v Speaker 1>So it was like a prototype of World War </v>
<v Speaker 1>II because Franco was a fascist and he </v>

618
00:38:48.731 --> 00:38:51.520
<v Speaker 1>ruled until wasn't very long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

619
00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:53.553
<v Speaker 1>compared to World War Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was maybe 1989 somewhere </v>

620
00:38:57.131 --> 00:38:57.964
<v Speaker 1>around 1980 he finally died and Fred and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spain transformed itself back into a </v>

621
00:39:02.801 --> 00:39:06.760
<v Speaker 1>democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I went to Spain just before that.</v>

622
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.360
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an unbelievably poor country.</v>

623
00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:11.733
<v Speaker 1>You could stay in Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of Madrid for a dollar 50 </v>

624
00:39:14.501 --> 00:39:15.334
<v Speaker 1>at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be probably equivalent to </v>

625
00:39:17.651 --> 00:39:18.484
<v Speaker 1>about $5 now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that got you a private room with a </v>

626
00:39:21.101 --> 00:39:25.030
<v Speaker 1>shower and breakfast and wine there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheaper than water.</v>

627
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:25.863
<v Speaker 1>It was about 75 cents a bottle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something I remember very </v>

628
00:39:28.601 --> 00:39:31.510
<v Speaker 1>fondly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

629
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:35.710
<v Speaker 1>its economy was entirely devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the Spanish civil war,</v>

630
00:39:35.711 --> 00:39:36.544
<v Speaker 1>the left wing rose up against them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fascists essentially in that was a </v>

631
00:39:39.701 --> 00:39:44.190
<v Speaker 1>precursor to World War II.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when World War II emerged,</v>

632
00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:47.320
<v Speaker 1>even though Stalin had made it number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>packs with Hitler,</v>

633
00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:50.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russians joined the West as an ally.</v>

634
00:39:50.081 --> 00:39:50.914
<v Speaker 1>And so for a while there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was counterproductive in some sense </v>

635
00:39:54.101 --> 00:39:57.720
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be criticizing the,</v>

636
00:39:58.220 --> 00:39:59.053
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union to intently because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was something that needed to be </v>

637
00:40:03.401 --> 00:40:04.234
<v Speaker 1>taken care of first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's some excuse for focusing on </v>

638
00:40:08.141 --> 00:40:08.974
<v Speaker 1>the Nazi horror first and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and only then focusing on what happened </v>

639
00:40:13.691 --> 00:40:17.630
<v Speaker 1>in the communist countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still by the end of World War II,</v>

640
00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:22.000
<v Speaker 1>anybody who wanted to know could know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that basically meant was that a</v>

641
00:40:22.001 --> 00:40:22.834
<v Speaker 1>massive swath of the western,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until intelligentsia put their damn </v>

642
00:40:26.531 --> 00:40:27.364
<v Speaker 1>heads in the sand and protected regimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were so pathological that they </v>

643
00:40:31.721 --> 00:40:32.830
<v Speaker 1>defied description.</v>

644
00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:37.510
<v Speaker 1>So there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are relatively new figures in this</v>

645
00:40:37.511 --> 00:40:41.230
<v Speaker 1>black book of communism that describe </v>
<v Speaker 1>deaths.</v>

646
00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:42.723
<v Speaker 1>So you can attribute 25 million deaths </v>
<v Speaker 1>directly to the Nazi oppression and 100 </v>

647
00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:49.443
<v Speaker 1>million to communism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the bulk of that was the Soviet </v>

648
00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:55.413
<v Speaker 1>Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's 20 to 35 million </v>

649
00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:59.260
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>estimated 60 million.</v>

650
00:40:59.261 --> 00:41:01.190
<v Speaker 1>And I should also say something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>soul Jeanette's.</v>

651
00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:05.890
<v Speaker 1>So the French intellectuals who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the publication of this book,</v>

652
00:41:05.891 --> 00:41:08.140
<v Speaker 1>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a hit in France.</v>

653
00:41:08.141 --> 00:41:10.570
<v Speaker 1>It was a bestseller and very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very controversial,</v>

654
00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:13.360
<v Speaker 1>partly because people said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

655
00:41:13.361 --> 00:41:15.120
<v Speaker 1>if you criticize the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you,</v>

656
00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:16.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the radical left,</v>

657
00:41:16.301 --> 00:41:18.370
<v Speaker 1>then you give carte blanche to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical,</v>

658
00:41:18.371 --> 00:41:19.204
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course the radical right has </v>

659
00:41:20.501 --> 00:41:22.600
<v Speaker 1>become an emergent phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

660
00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:26.140
<v Speaker 1>you're going to watch it play out </v>
<v Speaker 1>because here it comes,</v>

661
00:41:26.141 --> 00:41:27.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweden,</v>

662
00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:29.590
<v Speaker 1>all the Scandinavian countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>

663
00:41:29.591 --> 00:41:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Holland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>

664
00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:33.560
<v Speaker 1>the right wing parties are coming back.</v>

665
00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:36.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's not going to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

666
00:41:36.351 --> 00:41:38.600
<v Speaker 1>the same thing is happening in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States with trump.</v>

667
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:43.250
<v Speaker 1>So the left radical left wingers in </v>
<v Speaker 1>France were saying,</v>

668
00:41:43.251 --> 00:41:44.084
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't pick on the communists even </v>

669
00:41:45.141 --> 00:41:45.974
<v Speaker 1>historically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that'll validate the claims of </v>

670
00:41:47.421 --> 00:41:48.254
<v Speaker 1>the radical right wingers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is an entirely appalling </v>

671
00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:54.170
<v Speaker 1>and pathetic argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

672
00:41:54.171 --> 00:41:56.360
<v Speaker 1>it's like saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't criticize the Nazis,</v>

673
00:41:56.361 --> 00:41:58.250
<v Speaker 1>because that'll encourage the </v>
<v Speaker 1>communists.</v>

674
00:41:58.251 --> 00:42:01.460
<v Speaker 1>It's just not an acceptable way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>comporting yourself.</v>

675
00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:04.850
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

676
00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:05.713
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was not politically correct shall we </v>

677
00:42:10.731 --> 00:42:13.740
<v Speaker 1>say to criticize the Communists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in France and,</v>

678
00:42:13.741 --> 00:42:14.574
<v Speaker 1>but that turned around to some degree by</v>
<v Speaker 1>1999 but I should also say that it was </v>

679
00:42:19.671 --> 00:42:22.250
<v Speaker 1>1974 that soldier knits and wrote his </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

680
00:42:22.251 --> 00:42:23.084
<v Speaker 1>the Gulag Archipelago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you own it to know what was </v>

681
00:42:25.011 --> 00:42:26.960
<v Speaker 1>happening in the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

682
00:42:26.961 --> 00:42:29.360
<v Speaker 1>you had to do is read that book like </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a hell of a book.</v>

683
00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:33.620
<v Speaker 1>It's 27 I think it's 2,700 pages long </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's very small type and it's,</v>

684
00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:36.110
<v Speaker 1>it's one intense piece of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

685
00:42:36.111 --> 00:42:38.540
<v Speaker 1>you don't read that as bedtime reading </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>

686
00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:43.690
<v Speaker 1>it's so draw jokingly appalling that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like permanently traumatizing.</v>

687
00:42:43.941 --> 00:42:44.774
<v Speaker 1>But if you wanted to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could've known in 1974 and more to </v>

688
00:42:49.521 --> 00:42:50.354
<v Speaker 1>the point you could have known in 1945 </v>
<v Speaker 1>he could've known in 1930 but the </v>

689
00:42:53.781 --> 00:42:58.781
<v Speaker 1>western intelligentsia basically covered</v>
<v Speaker 1>up the communist pathology,</v>

690
00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:02.960
<v Speaker 1>I would say for something on the order </v>
<v Speaker 1>of 70 years.</v>

691
00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:04.003
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been no reckoning with that </v>

692
00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:08.600
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In America,</v>

693
00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:09.740
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in European,</v>

694
00:43:09.741 --> 00:43:14.030
<v Speaker 1>higher institutions of learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things I still see,</v>

695
00:43:14.031 --> 00:43:14.864
<v Speaker 1>and I see this because I talk about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a bit in my psychology to 30 </v>

696
00:43:17.271 --> 00:43:21.230
<v Speaker 1>classes that virtually every student </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows about the Holocaust and,</v>

697
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:25.070
<v Speaker 1>and for a good reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but very,</v>

698
00:43:25.071 --> 00:43:27.650
<v Speaker 1>very few people know what happened in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet,</v>

699
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:31.910
<v Speaker 1>in the Soviet Union or certainly in </v>
<v Speaker 1>China where the French estimates are now</v>

700
00:43:31.911 --> 00:43:34.070
<v Speaker 1>65 million people.</v>

701
00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:37.620
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>

702
00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:39.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so we'll pay to us.</v>

703
00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:41.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know some things about this,</v>

704
00:43:41.511 --> 00:43:42.800
<v Speaker 1>but not very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

705
00:43:42.801 --> 00:43:46.730
<v Speaker 1>I know that you could certainly make the</v>
<v Speaker 1>claim that Mao was the greatest monster,</v>

706
00:43:46.731 --> 00:43:48.770
<v Speaker 1>whoever lived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

707
00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.080
<v Speaker 1>even though he's still a revered figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>in China,</v>

708
00:43:51.081 --> 00:43:53.300
<v Speaker 1>which is appalling figure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

709
00:43:53.301 --> 00:43:57.440
<v Speaker 1>an appalling thing all in itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

710
00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you guys noticed this </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>

711
00:43:59.331 --> 00:44:00.164
<v Speaker 1>you probably didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that was trending </v>

712
00:44:01.461 --> 00:44:05.300
<v Speaker 1>on facebook was Kim young ills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's his name.</v>

713
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:11.150
<v Speaker 1>I get all those horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wretched dictators confused because they</v>

714
00:44:11.511 --> 00:44:15.980
<v Speaker 1>all look the same and have the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>general satanic essence.</v>

715
00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:20.120
<v Speaker 1>We basically like back in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in the 80s,</v>

716
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.983
<v Speaker 1>but it might've been in the 90s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>3 million or so North Korea and starve </v>

717
00:44:24.031 --> 00:44:26.900
<v Speaker 1>to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's his name?</v>

718
00:44:26.901 --> 00:44:30.410
<v Speaker 1>The dictator came out and announced </v>
<v Speaker 1>today too,</v>

719
00:44:30.411 --> 00:44:33.270
<v Speaker 1>is North Korean population that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have to go back.</v>

720
00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:36.390
<v Speaker 1>And he said this to sucking routes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>survive.</v>

721
00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:37.733
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's demanding that every family in the </v>

722
00:44:39.961 --> 00:44:44.961
<v Speaker 1>capitol donate two pounds of rice a </v>
<v Speaker 1>month to the state warehouses.</v>

723
00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:48.060
<v Speaker 1>So you can see where communist economics</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets you.</v>

724
00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:51.750
<v Speaker 1>It's the warehouses that are supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be distributing the food to the starving</v>

725
00:44:51.751 --> 00:44:52.584
<v Speaker 1>people that are now tyrannizing them </v>
<v Speaker 1>into donating what they don't even have </v>

726
00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:59.370
<v Speaker 1>to the state warehouses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

727
00:44:59.371 --> 00:45:00.204
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the last bastion of Stalinism </v>

728
00:45:02.071 --> 00:45:05.850
<v Speaker 1>slashed Maoism and the Chinese of course</v>
<v Speaker 1>still support North Korea,</v>

729
00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:09.480
<v Speaker 1>even though it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of pathological countries</v>

730
00:45:09.481 --> 00:45:11.520
<v Speaker 1>on the face of the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

731
00:45:11.521 --> 00:45:15.090
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to give either the gold or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the silver metal to North Korea,</v>

732
00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:20.130
<v Speaker 1>no where no one has enough to eat except</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tiny proportion of,</v>

733
00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:21.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

734
00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:24.720
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably corrupt aristocracy right </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the talk.</v>

735
00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:28.740
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's treated as if he's a divinity.</v>

736
00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:31.020
<v Speaker 1>He is a kind of divinity but not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive</v>

737
00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:32.820
<v Speaker 3>kind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

738
00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:38.440
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so back to back to,</v>

739
00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:42.850
<v Speaker 1>so the idea there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

740
00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:48.010
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rectify the plight of humanity,</v>

741
00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:51.250
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good way of conceptualizing the</v>

742
00:45:51.251 --> 00:45:52.084
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the plight is laid out both in the </v>

743
00:45:53.651 --> 00:45:58.060
<v Speaker 1>story of the Buddha and in the stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we covered last week in genesis.</v>

744
00:45:58.061 --> 00:45:58.894
<v Speaker 1>It's very straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People woke up and noticed that they </v>

745
00:46:01.181 --> 00:46:04.510
<v Speaker 1>were going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more complicated than that,</v>

746
00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:08.650
<v Speaker 1>but it's because it's not just death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's vulnerability in all fronts.</v>

747
00:46:08.651 --> 00:46:12.040
<v Speaker 1>So you could say death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insanity and social judgment.</v>

748
00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:14.110
<v Speaker 1>So death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>illness,</v>

749
00:46:14.111 --> 00:46:14.944
<v Speaker 1>insanity and social judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what being self conscious means </v>

750
00:46:18.881 --> 00:46:19.714
<v Speaker 1>to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that two largest class </v>

751
00:46:21.971 --> 00:46:22.804
<v Speaker 1>of fears go along with the mythological </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories that we've been discussing </v>

752
00:46:25.541 --> 00:46:28.840
<v Speaker 1>because people are most afraid of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible mother and the dragon,</v>

753
00:46:28.841 --> 00:46:30.580
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's chaos,</v>

754
00:46:30.581 --> 00:46:31.414
<v Speaker 1>that's death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing they're most afraid </v>

755
00:46:32.891 --> 00:46:34.210
<v Speaker 1>of is tyrangiel judgment.</v>

756
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:37.720
<v Speaker 1>And you know those things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>intertangled because of course,</v>

757
00:46:37.721 --> 00:46:42.721
<v Speaker 1>if you're rejected by your culture and </v>
<v Speaker 1>forced to the bottom of the hierarchy,</v>

758
00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:45.310
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>confront it,</v>

759
00:46:45.311 --> 00:46:48.130
<v Speaker 1>chaotic death radically increases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

760
00:46:48.131 --> 00:46:51.280
<v Speaker 1>you can't really separate out rejection </v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

761
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:54.010
<v Speaker 1>from chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those are deaf.</v>

762
00:46:54.011 --> 00:46:56.260
<v Speaker 1>And you'll see this with people with </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety disorders.</v>

763
00:46:56.261 --> 00:46:59.020
<v Speaker 1>They're almost always afraid of two </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories of things.</v>

764
00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:04.180
<v Speaker 1>One is death and the illness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other is social judgment.</v>

765
00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:06.610
<v Speaker 1>So if you take the typical agoraphobic </v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

766
00:47:06.611 --> 00:47:08.170
<v Speaker 1>because she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's usually she,</v>

767
00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:11.850
<v Speaker 1>her biggest fear is that she's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a heart attack on a subway and make</v>

768
00:47:11.851 --> 00:47:14.710
<v Speaker 1>a fool of herself while she dies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

769
00:47:14.711 --> 00:47:15.810
<v Speaker 1>because that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

770
00:47:15.830 --> 00:47:18.070
<v Speaker 1>it's like the ultimate nightmare in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

771
00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:19.840
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is in fact the ultimate</v>

772
00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:20.723
<v Speaker 3>nightmare.</v>

773
00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:27.290
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with the story of the Buddha</v>

774
00:47:27.291 --> 00:47:32.020
<v Speaker 1>in part is that the ending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the enlightenment element is vague.</v>

775
00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:33.093
<v Speaker 1>It isn't clear what happens there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I have a suspicion that that story </v>

776
00:47:37.361 --> 00:47:40.780
<v Speaker 1>grew out of a far older tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the shamanic tradition.</v>

777
00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:44.620
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of the shamanic tradition</v>

778
00:47:44.621 --> 00:47:45.454
<v Speaker 1>is that the Sharman usually they take </v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of psychoactive drug in the </v>

779
00:47:50.501 --> 00:47:53.770
<v Speaker 1>Siberia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is where shamanism was most widely</v>

780
00:47:53.771 --> 00:47:57.530
<v Speaker 1>spread and most established,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drug was am anita miscarried,</v>

781
00:47:57.550 --> 00:47:58.383
<v Speaker 1>which is a particular kind of mushroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the red mushroom with the white </v>

782
00:48:01.481 --> 00:48:02.314
<v Speaker 1>caps on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite white dots on it that you see in </v>

783
00:48:03.701 --> 00:48:06.490
<v Speaker 1>fairy tales all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a reason for that.</v>

784
00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:11.740
<v Speaker 1>And and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uphold that would occupy that.</v>

785
00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:12.663
<v Speaker 1>That connection between Earth and heaven</v>
<v Speaker 1>was often a central feature of a </v>

786
00:48:15.131 --> 00:48:17.440
<v Speaker 1>shamanic ritual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that was happening</v>

787
00:48:17.441 --> 00:48:20.110
<v Speaker 1>with the showman is that when they took </v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychoactive drug,</v>

788
00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:21.333
<v Speaker 1>they would climb in the pool that </v>
<v Speaker 1>represented that connection between </v>

789
00:48:24.611 --> 00:48:25.444
<v Speaker 1>earth and have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they would go up into the </v>

790
00:48:26.441 --> 00:48:27.274
<v Speaker 1>domain of the gods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is roughly equivalent to the idea </v>

791
00:48:29.381 --> 00:48:30.670
<v Speaker 1>of Buddha reaching nirvana.</v>

792
00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:32.073
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a UN charted relationship </v>

793
00:48:36.971 --> 00:48:39.130
<v Speaker 1>between the most archaic human </v>
<v Speaker 1>religions,</v>

794
00:48:39.131 --> 00:48:39.964
<v Speaker 1>which were virtually undoubtedly </v>
<v Speaker 1>grounded in the use of very powerful </v>

795
00:48:43.811 --> 00:48:47.110
<v Speaker 1>psychoactive chemicals and the Buddhist </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition.</v>

796
00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:51.760
<v Speaker 1>And I think part of the reason that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vagueness is there is because the direct</v>

797
00:48:51.761 --> 00:48:54.940
<v Speaker 1>connection between the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>

798
00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:59.950
<v Speaker 1>the theological use of transformative </v>
<v Speaker 1>substances.</v>

799
00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:02.830
<v Speaker 1>And the doctrine per se is not being </v>
<v Speaker 1>well specified.</v>

800
00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:06.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean now you see the same thing in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in South America,</v>

801
00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:11.440
<v Speaker 1>the drug there is usually Iowasca,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is chemically actually</v>

802
00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:16.720
<v Speaker 1>am Anita Mascara's different chemicals </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Iowasca.</v>

803
00:49:16.721 --> 00:49:20.320
<v Speaker 1>IOWASCA is very much like psilocybin and</v>
<v Speaker 1>LSD.</v>

804
00:49:20.321 --> 00:49:22.480
<v Speaker 1>It has the same ring molecular </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

805
00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:26.800
<v Speaker 1>But of course when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the Amazonian Sharman take Iowasca,</v>

806
00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:31.750
<v Speaker 1>they also communicate with the ancestors</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the gods.</v>

807
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:36.370
<v Speaker 1>That's a classic shamanically</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathway.</v>

808
00:49:36.371 --> 00:49:39.550
<v Speaker 1>First communion with the ancestors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then communion with the gods,</v>

809
00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:44.790
<v Speaker 1>and it's actually based on the direct </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of the people who are putting</v>

810
00:49:45.641 --> 00:49:47.560
<v Speaker 1>themselves into this ceremony.</v>

811
00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:49.053
<v Speaker 1>So there's also some very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>connections historically between </v>

812
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:56.620
<v Speaker 1>Christianity and the use likely of </v>
<v Speaker 1>siliciden mushrooms.</v>

813
00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:57.633
<v Speaker 1>So there was a very weird book written </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1968 or thereabouts called the magic </v>

814
00:50:01.151 --> 00:50:03.270
<v Speaker 1>mushroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sacred mushroom and the cross,</v>

815
00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:08.340
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the name of it where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a linguist who identified linguistic</v>

816
00:50:09.581 --> 00:50:14.581
<v Speaker 1>patterns between the theological claims </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Christianity and the language used to</v>

817
00:50:15.701 --> 00:50:16.534
<v Speaker 1>describe mushrooms and their effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that book came out sort of at the </v>

818
00:50:20.321 --> 00:50:23.830
<v Speaker 1>height of the hippie revolution and even</v>
<v Speaker 1>though it was a serious book,</v>

819
00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:27.160
<v Speaker 1>it was sort of shunted off into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hippies wrote this category.</v>

820
00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:29.810
<v Speaker 1>It's not a hippie book at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read it a couple of times.</v>

821
00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:32.360
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea what to make of the board</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

822
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:33.553
<v Speaker 1>because it's based on like with sticks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's far outside my range of of </v>

823
00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:38.353
<v Speaker 1>competence to evaluate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you certainly can't brush it off </v>

824
00:50:41.031 --> 00:50:41.570
<v Speaker 1>lightly.</v>

825
00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:42.403
<v Speaker 1>And since then there's been all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence emerged that the use of </v>

826
00:50:46.341 --> 00:50:49.640
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms might've been central to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>too early Christianity.</v>

827
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:53.120
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental split,</v>

828
00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:58.550
<v Speaker 1>you could say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a reasonable way to look</v>

829
00:50:58.551 --> 00:50:59.384
<v Speaker 1>at it too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that once the basic problem that </v>

830
00:51:02.451 --> 00:51:05.090
<v Speaker 1>faces humanity is laid out rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly.</v>

831
00:51:05.091 --> 00:51:06.900
<v Speaker 1>And so we'll say the s the problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>month,</v>

832
00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:11.480
<v Speaker 1>painful self consciousness and knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 1>of which is a major problem,</v>

833
00:51:11.481 --> 00:51:13.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the terror management people,</v>

834
00:51:13.890 --> 00:51:14.723
<v Speaker 1>it's social psychologists who are terror</v>
<v Speaker 1>management theorists basically say that </v>

835
00:51:18.411 --> 00:51:19.244
<v Speaker 1>that's rendered people permanently </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological and that they have to use </v>

836
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:25.350
<v Speaker 1>illusion in order to defend themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>against that.</v>

837
00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:28.510
<v Speaker 1>Freud basically made the same argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

838
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.640
<v Speaker 1>when he was criticizing classical </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>

839
00:51:31.641 --> 00:51:32.930
<v Speaker 1>he basically said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

840
00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:34.153
<v Speaker 1>people are using religious nonsense </v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking as a way of shielding </v>

841
00:51:38.091 --> 00:51:38.924
<v Speaker 1>themselves against their fear of death </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're too immature to be able </v>

842
00:51:41.721 --> 00:51:42.980
<v Speaker 1>to tolerate the reality.</v>

843
00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:45.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

844
00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:46.453
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting criticism and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>found it quite compelling for quite a </v>

845
00:51:49.611 --> 00:51:53.360
<v Speaker 1>long time and I do think that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>hide in their belief systems.</v>

846
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:54.223
<v Speaker 1>But I think one of the basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>shortcomings of the Friday and ideas </v>

847
00:51:57.291 --> 00:52:01.640
<v Speaker 1>that it doesn't really account for why </v>
<v Speaker 1>people would invent the idea of hell,</v>

848
00:52:01.641 --> 00:52:04.280
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that doesn't really seem to be a</v>

849
00:52:04.281 --> 00:52:06.320
<v Speaker 1>lot more comforting than the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

850
00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:07.610
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot worse.</v>

851
00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:08.473
<v Speaker 1>It's like not only cause you to die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you die permanently or you die </v>

852
00:52:11.841 --> 00:52:15.440
<v Speaker 1>forever continually in the most painful </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible ways.</v>

853
00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:18.920
<v Speaker 1>I can't really see that as a why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why bother with that?</v>

854
00:52:18.921 --> 00:52:20.330
<v Speaker 1>If it's an illusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

855
00:52:20.331 --> 00:52:22.490
<v Speaker 1>well it's just to make the illusion more</v>
<v Speaker 1>believable.</v>

856
00:52:22.491 --> 00:52:23.324
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you have to throw to conspiracies </v>

857
00:52:25.311 --> 00:52:27.860
<v Speaker 1>together to account for a phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're,</v>

858
00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:31.180
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the onus of proof is definitely on you.</v>

859
00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:33.710
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

860
00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:36.110
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then the question is,</v>

861
00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:38.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the,</v>

862
00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:42.410
<v Speaker 1>what's the cure for the pathology that </v>
<v Speaker 1>self conscious pathology?</v>

863
00:52:42.411 --> 00:52:43.610
<v Speaker 1>And I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could say,</v>

864
00:52:43.611 --> 00:52:45.230
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two answers to that.</v>

865
00:52:45.231 --> 00:52:49.760
<v Speaker 1>And one is the building of a state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

866
00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:50.713
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's obviously that's if some </v>

867
00:52:52.701 --> 00:52:53.534
<v Speaker 1>utility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the terror management people </v>

868
00:52:55.971 --> 00:53:00.971
<v Speaker 1>tend to think of culture as </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological and as a defense mechanism</v>

869
00:53:01.581 --> 00:53:03.490
<v Speaker 1>against the fear of death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

870
00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:07.490
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an overly psychological explanation</v>

871
00:53:07.491 --> 00:53:08.324
<v Speaker 1>because obviously one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture does as well as protecting you </v>

872
00:53:11.421 --> 00:53:14.570
<v Speaker 1>from the fear of death is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect you from death.</v>

873
00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:15.733
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our culture does everything it can </v>

874
00:53:17.361 --> 00:53:22.361
<v Speaker 1>not only to protect you from death but </v>
<v Speaker 1>also to protect you from any exposure to</v>

875
00:53:22.941 --> 00:53:23.661
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

876
00:53:23.661 --> 00:53:24.494
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something the sixties </v>

877
00:53:25.951 --> 00:53:26.784
<v Speaker 1>hippies jumped up and down about two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason that we have </v>

878
00:53:28.831 --> 00:53:33.540
<v Speaker 1>psychiatric nomenclature and an entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatric system is to take people who</v>

879
00:53:33.541 --> 00:53:37.590
<v Speaker 1>are so crazy that they're disturbing off</v>
<v Speaker 1>the streets so that they don't,</v>

880
00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:38.813
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rake existential have on the people who </v>

881
00:53:41.641 --> 00:53:42.474
<v Speaker 1>are outside.</v>

882
00:53:42.810 --> 00:53:43.643
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can debate about whether or not </v>

883
00:53:44.821 --> 00:53:46.680
<v Speaker 1>that's appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

884
00:53:46.681 --> 00:53:47.514
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely the case that it's much </v>
<v Speaker 1>more difficult to walk down the street </v>

885
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:54.000
<v Speaker 1>if there's very many people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>overtly damaged.</v>

886
00:53:54.001 --> 00:53:56.790
<v Speaker 1>And expressive about it on that street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can say,</v>

887
00:53:56.791 --> 00:53:58.200
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a right to be there.</v>

888
00:53:58.410 --> 00:53:59.550
<v Speaker 1>And you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

889
00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:01.500
<v Speaker 1>the public has a right to protect </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

890
00:54:01.501 --> 00:54:04.200
<v Speaker 1>And obviously both those claims are </v>
<v Speaker 1>valid and there's,</v>

891
00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:05.243
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right way through it as a </v>

892
00:54:06.331 --> 00:54:09.990
<v Speaker 1>consequence of dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's still nonetheless the case that</v>

893
00:54:10.350 --> 00:54:11.183
<v Speaker 1>we're almost never exposed to extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>old age were never exposed to death and </v>

894
00:54:15.181 --> 00:54:17.310
<v Speaker 1>we're almost never exposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

895
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:21.780
<v Speaker 1>insanity and physical illness unless you</v>
<v Speaker 1>go into a hospital or a place like that.</v>

896
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:23.543
<v Speaker 1>So one answer to the problem that faces </v>
<v Speaker 1>mankind is the state as the answer and </v>

897
00:54:29.131 --> 00:54:30.840
<v Speaker 1>the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's,</v>

898
00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:32.400
<v Speaker 1>and then we can examine that.</v>

899
00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.233
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with that seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the state can split into something </v>

900
00:54:37.021 --> 00:54:39.330
<v Speaker 1>that's very pathological and something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't,</v>

901
00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:41.760
<v Speaker 1>those are the archetypal elements of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

902
00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:45.990
<v Speaker 1>And then you could make a case that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>the state is fully pathological,</v>

903
00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:48.480
<v Speaker 1>it's actually worse than the original </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

904
00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:51.330
<v Speaker 1>So then the question becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

905
00:54:51.331 --> 00:54:55.530
<v Speaker 1>well the state has utility what you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>to stop it from becoming corrupt.</v>

906
00:54:55.830 --> 00:54:58.440
<v Speaker 1>That's the real question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as I can tell.</v>

907
00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:00.293
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say the Egyptians </v>
<v Speaker 1>partially solved that problem when they </v>

908
00:55:04.741 --> 00:55:06.600
<v Speaker 1>started to build their mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

909
00:55:06.601 --> 00:55:08.550
<v Speaker 1>And no cyrus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they basically said,</v>

910
00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:09.743
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two principles that have to be </v>

911
00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:16.640
<v Speaker 1>at work in order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only in order to maintain the state.</v>

912
00:55:17.101 --> 00:55:20.250
<v Speaker 1>And so we'll say against Isis and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces of the underworld.</v>

913
00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:22.440
<v Speaker 1>Isis being the goddess of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>underworld,</v>

914
00:55:22.441 --> 00:55:25.380
<v Speaker 1>not the new isis is pretty damn funding </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

915
00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:26.760
<v Speaker 1>That's their initials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

916
00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:30.480
<v Speaker 1>so</v>
<v Speaker 1>the states in necessity,</v>

917
00:55:30.481 --> 00:55:34.830
<v Speaker 1>but it has to be updated as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the careful action of the</v>

918
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:37.200
<v Speaker 1>citizen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

919
00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:39.810
<v Speaker 1>by the attention of the citizen </v>
<v Speaker 1>represented by Horace.</v>

920
00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:40.913
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are many critiques of </v>

921
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:43.463
<v Speaker 1>Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say most of these come on the </v>

922
00:55:46.561 --> 00:55:47.394
<v Speaker 1>atheistic end of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who make the point that if you take the </v>

923
00:55:51.541 --> 00:55:52.374
<v Speaker 1>mythologies of Horace and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythologies of Christ and you line them </v>

924
00:55:56.011 --> 00:55:58.680
<v Speaker 1>up side by side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're virtually the same.</v>

925
00:55:59.010 --> 00:56:02.550
<v Speaker 1>So many of the mythological elements of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ's cause.</v>

926
00:56:02.551 --> 00:56:05.250
<v Speaker 1>He's half saying that the logical and </v>
<v Speaker 1>half historical,</v>

927
00:56:05.251 --> 00:56:08.070
<v Speaker 1>though the evidence for his historical </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence is very,</v>

928
00:56:08.071 --> 00:56:11.610
<v Speaker 1>very thin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's heavily mythologized.</v>

929
00:56:11.611 --> 00:56:12.444
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of the mythology that was used</v>
<v Speaker 1>to represent Christ was just taken </v>

930
00:56:14.971 --> 00:56:15.804
<v Speaker 1>completely from the mythology of horace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the atheist tick wing of </v>

931
00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:23.740
<v Speaker 1>criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>critics of Christianity say,</v>

932
00:56:23.741 --> 00:56:24.574
<v Speaker 1>well obviously that means that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity is false because it's </v>

933
00:56:27.311 --> 00:56:28.144
<v Speaker 1>central figure was just granted the </v>
<v Speaker 1>attributes of the previous Egyptian </v>

934
00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:35.073
<v Speaker 1>Daddy.</v>

935
00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:36.890
<v Speaker 4>But well,</v>

936
00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:46.750
<v Speaker 1>but I think that that criticism is </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally beside the point in,</v>

937
00:56:46.790 --> 00:56:47.623
<v Speaker 1>in the most important of ways because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideas of what characterized horace </v>

938
00:56:52.461 --> 00:56:53.294
<v Speaker 1>emerged as a consequence of a lengthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say evolutionary process to </v>

939
00:56:57.351 --> 00:57:01.520
<v Speaker 1>define what constituted the central </v>
<v Speaker 1>redeem or rubbed the state,</v>

940
00:57:01.610 --> 00:57:02.443
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that was just translated on to </v>

941
00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:05.743
<v Speaker 1>Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that that is just a continuation of </v>

942
00:57:08.481 --> 00:57:09.314
<v Speaker 1>the religious dream in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not indication that there's </v>

943
00:57:12.921 --> 00:57:16.040
<v Speaker 1>something fundamentally fraudulent about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity.</v>

944
00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:17.953
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you think that Christianity is </v>

945
00:57:20.751 --> 00:57:25.220
<v Speaker 1>based on the kind of history that </v>
<v Speaker 1>empirical historic historians regard his</v>

946
00:57:25.221 --> 00:57:27.590
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not the only kind of history.</v>

947
00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:33.460
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

948
00:57:33.461 --> 00:57:34.294
<v Speaker 1>so then I want it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk about something else in </v>

949
00:57:36.491 --> 00:57:37.900
<v Speaker 1>relationship to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

950
00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:44.510
<v Speaker 1>and this is sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>

951
00:57:45.231 --> 00:57:48.260
<v Speaker 1>this is the last part of the course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is good.</v>

952
00:57:48.261 --> 00:57:49.640
<v Speaker 1>Given that we're coming to the end.</v>

953
00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:57.390
<v Speaker 1>When I was working on these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I laid out the logic that you just,</v>

954
00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:59.160
<v Speaker 1>that I just described to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

955
00:57:59.170 --> 00:58:02.010
<v Speaker 1>to mankind as a fundamental existential </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

956
00:58:02.310 --> 00:58:05.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's a particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical claim that's made.</v>

957
00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:07.890
<v Speaker 1>The claim is made by all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>schools of thought,</v>

958
00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:09.053
<v Speaker 1>not least the existentialists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would say that that problem was </v>

959
00:58:12.391 --> 00:58:15.540
<v Speaker 1>already put very clearly in our most </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient religious writings.</v>

960
00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:18.360
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a new idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>

961
00:58:18.361 --> 00:58:22.740
<v Speaker 1>very old idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then out of that emerged,</v>

962
00:58:22.741 --> 00:58:23.574
<v Speaker 1>the idea that is state would emerge as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>medication for that fundamental </v>

963
00:58:28.801 --> 00:58:29.634
<v Speaker 1>pathology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you see that in genesis right away </v>

964
00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:33.090
<v Speaker 1>because as soon as Adam and eve have </v>
<v Speaker 1>their eyes open,</v>

965
00:58:33.091 --> 00:58:33.924
<v Speaker 1>they put on tape leafs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing they do is turn fig </v>

966
00:58:36.811 --> 00:58:38.820
<v Speaker 1>leaf is an emblem of culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

967
00:58:38.821 --> 00:58:39.654
<v Speaker 1>it's clothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so clothing is certainly one of the </v>

968
00:58:41.701 --> 00:58:43.710
<v Speaker 1>things that distinguishes us from </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

969
00:58:44.190 --> 00:58:48.480
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that we could build </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures that would protect ourselves,</v>

970
00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:49.733
<v Speaker 1>well that's what we do and they work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't necessarily solve the </v>

971
00:58:53.671 --> 00:58:58.170
<v Speaker 1>fundamental problem or at least they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't solve it permanently and they lead</v>

972
00:58:58.171 --> 00:58:59.004
<v Speaker 1>to another set of problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other set of problems is the </v>

973
00:59:00.871 --> 00:59:01.704
<v Speaker 1>pathology of the state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the state then instead of </v>

974
00:59:03.871 --> 00:59:04.704
<v Speaker 1>becoming a defense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a genuine defense or let's even say an </v>

975
00:59:07.921 --> 00:59:08.754
<v Speaker 1>adaptation to our vulnerability starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>to become an exploiter of our </v>

976
00:59:11.791 --> 00:59:14.610
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that,</v>

977
00:59:15.330 --> 00:59:18.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are roots.</v>

978
00:59:18.330 --> 00:59:20.970
<v Speaker 1>So the communist idea was a utopian </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal.</v>

979
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:24.770
<v Speaker 5>And the idea was that,</v>

980
00:59:27.250 --> 00:59:28.083
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

981
00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:32.390
<v Speaker 5>the idea was that the pathology that </v>
<v Speaker 5>characterized human beings could be laid</v>

982
00:59:32.391 --> 00:59:37.391
<v Speaker 5>at the feet of the state.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was no notion whatsoever that part</v>

983
00:59:38.541 --> 00:59:42.410
<v Speaker 5>of the pathology of being human is an </v>
<v Speaker 5>inbuilt part of being human.</v>

984
00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:43.253
<v Speaker 5>Now that's kind of an original sin claim</v>
<v Speaker 5>in some sense is that we could keep all </v>

985
00:59:46.461 --> 00:59:47.890
<v Speaker 5>the culture we want,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our new,</v>

986
00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:49.880
<v Speaker 5>it's not going to solve your problem</v>

987
00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:51.733
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

988
00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:56.550
<v Speaker 5>So the Marxist utopia and idea had its </v>
<v Speaker 5>roots in surgery,</v>

989
00:59:56.551 --> 01:00:01.320
<v Speaker 5>strains of Christian Utopian thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So because it was Saint Thomas Moore who</v>

990
01:00:01.321 --> 01:00:03.960
<v Speaker 5>wrote the first book on Utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

991
01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:04.973
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Christianity in some sense influenced </v>

992
01:00:06.451 --> 01:00:07.284
<v Speaker 5>the Utopian element of Marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was the Marxists in particular </v>

993
01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:11.513
<v Speaker 5>who decided that the reason that human </v>
<v Speaker 5>beings had problems was because of the </v>

994
01:00:14.701 --> 01:00:16.350
<v Speaker 5>organization of the state</v>

995
01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:18.173
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

996
01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:19.633
<v Speaker 5>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then there was a conclusion from </v>

997
01:00:20.931 --> 01:00:22.220
<v Speaker 5>that and the conclusion was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

998
01:00:22.221 --> 01:00:25.910
<v Speaker 5>if you just got rid of the apparent </v>
<v Speaker 5>pathology of the state,</v>

999
01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:28.880
<v Speaker 5>then people would enter into a utopian </v>
<v Speaker 5>mode of being.</v>

1000
01:00:28.881 --> 01:00:30.830
<v Speaker 5>And so what are the pathologies in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>state?</v>

1001
01:00:30.930 --> 01:00:31.763
<v Speaker 5>While there are still the things that </v>
<v Speaker 5>radical egalitarians are opposed to </v>

1002
01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:38.900
<v Speaker 5>hierarchical structure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>differential,</v>

1003
01:00:39.090 --> 01:00:40.940
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>distribution of resources,</v>

1004
01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:43.870
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty much,</v>

1005
01:00:45.210 --> 01:00:47.070
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>private ownership is part of that.</v>

1006
01:00:47.071 --> 01:00:47.904
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say that that's more like an </v>

1007
01:00:49.891 --> 01:00:54.150
<v Speaker 5>intake really that's tied integrity </v>
<v Speaker 5>within the first two problems.</v>

1008
01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:54.984
<v Speaker 5>And so then the Marxist idea was </v>
<v Speaker 5>basically on the one hand eradicate </v>

1009
01:00:58.921 --> 01:00:59.754
<v Speaker 5>prior to private property,</v>
<v Speaker 5>distribute resources equally eliminate </v>

1010
01:01:02.761 --> 01:01:03.594
<v Speaker 5>the distinctions between the classes </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they thought of classes as the </v>

1011
01:01:06.271 --> 01:01:08.580
<v Speaker 5>fundamental dividing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1012
01:01:08.581 --> 01:01:11.220
<v Speaker 5>categories of people not race like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Nazis,</v>

1013
01:01:11.221 --> 01:01:12.054
<v Speaker 5>but class.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you'd usher inna an endless </v>

1014
01:01:15.601 --> 01:01:18.720
<v Speaker 5>utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1015
01:01:18.721 --> 01:01:20.190
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stated like that.</v>

1016
01:01:20.191 --> 01:01:23.790
<v Speaker 5>It just sounds stupid and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I,</v>

1017
01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:24.743
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1018
01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:25.950
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1019
01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:29.430
<v Speaker 5>maybe that's too harsh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't really think it is in,</v>

1020
01:01:29.431 --> 01:01:33.270
<v Speaker 5>in the late 1800 stores get dusty Husky,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he knew all this was coming.</v>

1021
01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:37.950
<v Speaker 5>He absolutely knew this was coming and </v>
<v Speaker 5>God only knows how he knew it.</v>

1022
01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:41.670
<v Speaker 5>I mean human would say he was very much </v>
<v Speaker 5>in touch with the collective unconscious</v>

1023
01:01:41.671 --> 01:01:44.150
<v Speaker 5>and you could think of the collective </v>
<v Speaker 5>unconscious in some senses.</v>

1024
01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:46.470
<v Speaker 5>Like imagine that you have a system of </v>
<v Speaker 5>ideas,</v>

1025
01:01:46.830 --> 01:01:48.040
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>think you are,</v>

1026
01:01:48.090 --> 01:01:50.100
<v Speaker 5>that you articulate and you are aware </v>
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

1027
01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:53.130
<v Speaker 5>but they rest on a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1028
01:01:53.131 --> 01:01:55.200
<v Speaker 5>which is the place where the ideas are </v>
<v Speaker 5>coming from.</v>

1029
01:01:55.201 --> 01:01:58.740
<v Speaker 5>But also like the matrix out of which </v>
<v Speaker 5>the ideas emerge.</v>

1030
01:01:58.980 --> 01:01:59.813
<v Speaker 5>It's a dream like fantasy and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>something that's more or less shared by </v>

1031
01:02:02.581 --> 01:02:03.414
<v Speaker 5>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you could be farther away or closer </v>

1032
01:02:05.821 --> 01:02:09.570
<v Speaker 5>to that underlying dream like structure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the more artistic you are,</v>

1033
01:02:10.170 --> 01:02:11.003
<v Speaker 5>the more open,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say the closer you are to that </v>

1034
01:02:12.811 --> 01:02:13.070
<v Speaker 5>dream.</v>

1035
01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:16.800
<v Speaker 5>Like structure or Dostoyevsky was </v>
<v Speaker 5>immersed right inside of it.</v>

1036
01:02:16.801 --> 01:02:19.080
<v Speaker 5>And I think that was partly because he </v>
<v Speaker 5>was epileptic.</v>

1037
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:25.010
<v Speaker 5>So because epileptics have transcendent </v>
<v Speaker 5>experiences often and,</v>

1038
01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:29.880
<v Speaker 5>and suffer from an overwhelming </v>
<v Speaker 5>intensification of emotions.</v>

1039
01:02:29.881 --> 01:02:32.790
<v Speaker 5>And so that did something to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dorsey has keep it sort of put them into</v>

1040
01:02:32.791 --> 01:02:35.310
<v Speaker 5>a different category.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what it looks like to me.</v>

1041
01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:38.280
<v Speaker 5>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he knew this was coming in in his book,</v>

1042
01:02:38.281 --> 01:02:40.980
<v Speaker 5>the Devil's aptly named or the </v>
<v Speaker 5>possessed,</v>

1043
01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:43.890
<v Speaker 5>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is what's wrong with Russia.</v>

1044
01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:44.993
<v Speaker 5>Here's what's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As a consequence of our belief system </v>

1045
01:02:46.801 --> 01:02:47.634
<v Speaker 5>falling apart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's the sort of person who is </v>

1046
01:02:49.261 --> 01:02:52.350
<v Speaker 5>destined to emerge and this is what's </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to happen.</v>

1047
01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:55.380
<v Speaker 5>It's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1048
01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:59.550
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and at the same time,</v>

1049
01:02:59.551 --> 01:03:01.920
<v Speaker 5>Dostoyevsky was thinking this through </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he and miss,</v>

1050
01:03:01.921 --> 01:03:04.230
<v Speaker 5>he did most clearly in the book notes </v>
<v Speaker 5>from underground,</v>

1051
01:03:04.231 --> 01:03:07.260
<v Speaker 5>which I would highly recommend that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>read because it's very short.</v>

1052
01:03:07.261 --> 01:03:10.280
<v Speaker 5>It's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's an ultra bleed.</v>

1053
01:03:10.281 --> 01:03:13.530
<v Speaker 5>Brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the reason it's brilliant is because</v>

1054
01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:16.080
<v Speaker 5>Dostoyevsky's main character in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>book,</v>

1055
01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:17.063
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's partly informed by </v>

1056
01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:18.714
<v Speaker 5>autobiographical experience,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is a failed civil servant who is a </v>

1057
01:03:23.071 --> 01:03:23.904
<v Speaker 5>nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And who was super resentful and he's a </v>

1058
01:03:25.951 --> 01:03:27.630
<v Speaker 5>coward.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's angry,</v>

1059
01:03:27.631 --> 01:03:29.700
<v Speaker 5>resentful and cowardly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he's very,</v>

1060
01:03:29.701 --> 01:03:30.534
<v Speaker 5>very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And of course he's very proud about the </v>

1061
01:03:31.921 --> 01:03:35.400
<v Speaker 5>fact that he's smart because that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>pretty much what he has to cling on to.</v>

1062
01:03:35.401 --> 01:03:37.380
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't have a family,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't have anything else,</v>

1063
01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:38.783
<v Speaker 5>but so he's an appalling person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could say he's caught the </v>

1064
01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:43.730
<v Speaker 5>underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what's interesting is that right</v>

1065
01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:45.850
<v Speaker 2>eat</v>

1066
01:03:45.850 --> 01:03:48.010
<v Speaker 5>being caught in the underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in that chaos,</v>

1067
01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:52.690
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't degenerate right into someone</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's not allistic or totalitarian.</v>

1068
01:03:53.310 --> 01:03:54.143
<v Speaker 5>He kind of tolerates the tension and </v>
<v Speaker 5>there are certain things that emerge </v>

1069
01:03:56.741 --> 01:03:59.230
<v Speaker 5>for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for him as potential truths.</v>

1070
01:03:59.530 --> 01:04:00.363
<v Speaker 5>And so one of the things he says was </v>
<v Speaker 5>that he sort of toyed with the idea of </v>

1071
01:04:03.521 --> 01:04:08.521
<v Speaker 5>utopia and he talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he talks about the palace of crystal.</v>

1072
01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:10.533
<v Speaker 5>And so in the palace of crystal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a perfect future utopia and </v>

1073
01:04:14.590 --> 01:04:16.480
<v Speaker 5>everyone has provided with what they </v>
<v Speaker 5>need.</v>

1074
01:04:16.481 --> 01:04:20.980
<v Speaker 5>And Dostoevsky says there are so well </v>
<v Speaker 5>provided that all they have to do is eat</v>

1075
01:04:20.981 --> 01:04:24.760
<v Speaker 5>cakes and busied themselves with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>reproduction of the species all day.</v>

1076
01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:26.133
<v Speaker 5>So you could think about it as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>realization in a sense is a concrete </v>

1077
01:04:29.591 --> 01:04:32.980
<v Speaker 5>realization of an economic utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to work.</v>

1078
01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:36.520
<v Speaker 5>Everything you want is provided for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So everyone's happy.</v>

1079
01:04:36.850 --> 01:04:38.170
<v Speaker 5>And Dostoevsky says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1080
01:04:38.171 --> 01:04:41.320
<v Speaker 5>you have to be out of your mind to think</v>
<v Speaker 5>that everyone would be happy under those</v>

1081
01:04:41.321 --> 01:04:44.560
<v Speaker 5>circumstances because people are </v>
<v Speaker 5>fundamentally insane.</v>

1082
01:04:44.890 --> 01:04:47.770
<v Speaker 5>And so that if you gave people </v>
<v Speaker 5>perfection,</v>

1083
01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:51.370
<v Speaker 5>the first thing they would do once they </v>
<v Speaker 5>got bored,</v>

1084
01:04:51.390 --> 01:04:53.710
<v Speaker 5>three quarters to death,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which would take about a week,</v>

1085
01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:56.590
<v Speaker 5>is run around looking for something to </v>
<v Speaker 5>smash,</v>

1086
01:04:56.650 --> 01:04:57.483
<v Speaker 5>just to cause some trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just so that there'd be an interesting </v>

1087
01:04:59.891 --> 01:05:02.740
<v Speaker 5>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think while you can see the,</v>

1088
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:04.870
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the relationship between that and the,</v>

1089
01:05:05.050 --> 01:05:06.300
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

1090
01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:07.900
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the events in,</v>

1091
01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:10.300
<v Speaker 5>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the book of Genesis at the beginning,</v>

1092
01:05:10.301 --> 01:05:12.970
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because God tells eve don't mock up out,</v>

1093
01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:14.133
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>be satisfied with what you've got and </v>

1094
01:05:15.971 --> 01:05:16.804
<v Speaker 5>her curiosity and to go interact with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the one thing in the whole place that </v>

1095
01:05:20.651 --> 01:05:23.740
<v Speaker 5>she shouldn't interact with and then all</v>
<v Speaker 5>hell breaks loose.</v>

1096
01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:27.220
<v Speaker 5>And then you have to ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that a good thing or a bad thing?</v>

1097
01:05:27.370 --> 01:05:28.203
<v Speaker 5>And what Dostoyevsky concludes is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a good thing is it's that that </v>

1098
01:05:33.011 --> 01:05:33.844
<v Speaker 5>fundamental experience seeking </v>
<v Speaker 5>disruptive element of the human psyche </v>

1099
01:05:38.441 --> 01:05:39.274
<v Speaker 5>is actually the best thing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the idea that we could quell it's </v>

1100
01:05:42.701 --> 01:05:46.060
<v Speaker 5>operation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but by providing what's essentially a,</v>

1101
01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:47.200
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

1102
01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:49.950
<v Speaker 5>a return to the womb is something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1103
01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:50.793
<v Speaker 5>you could think about it that way where </v>
<v Speaker 5>you have no problems to think that that </v>

1104
01:05:53.561 --> 01:05:54.394
<v Speaker 5>would actually solve the problem is not </v>
<v Speaker 5>only absurdly immature but also just </v>

1105
01:06:00.371 --> 01:06:02.680
<v Speaker 5>false on the face of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think,</v>

1106
01:06:02.681 --> 01:06:05.410
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

1107
01:06:05.411 --> 01:06:07.050
<v Speaker 5>that's an amazing conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1108
01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:09.790
<v Speaker 5>think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dostoyevsky's thought that through.</v>

1109
01:06:10.090 --> 01:06:15.010
<v Speaker 5>He figured out what was wrong with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>idea of communist utopia 40 years before</v>

1110
01:06:15.011 --> 01:06:16.840
<v Speaker 5>the Russian revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1111
01:06:16.841 --> 01:06:19.660
<v Speaker 5>it's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not only did he see what was coming,</v>

1112
01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:21.820
<v Speaker 5>he saw what was wrong with it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1113
01:06:21.821 --> 01:06:23.800
<v Speaker 5>and you could say the same thing about </v>
<v Speaker 5>Nichelle though,</v>

1114
01:06:23.801 --> 01:06:24.634
<v Speaker 5>I don't think Nietzsche ever read road </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything that has the like concentrated </v>

1115
01:06:28.781 --> 01:06:31.000
<v Speaker 5>narrative punch of notes from </v>
<v Speaker 5>underground.</v>

1116
01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:34.180
<v Speaker 5>And what happens in the [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 5>notes from underground.</v>

1117
01:06:34.181 --> 01:06:39.100
<v Speaker 5>In some senses it's a novel about </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone attempting to take niches,</v>

1118
01:06:39.130 --> 01:06:39.963
<v Speaker 5>route to being a superman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of Dostoyevsky's novels or both </v>

1119
01:06:43.011 --> 01:06:43.844
<v Speaker 5>that so risk gallman caught for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in crime and punishment who heads up </v>

1120
01:06:46.571 --> 01:06:47.404
<v Speaker 5>being a murderer essentially tries to </v>
<v Speaker 5>transform himself into a Nietzschean </v>

1121
01:06:50.471 --> 01:06:51.304
<v Speaker 5>Superman beyond good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>making his own values and Dostoyevsky </v>

1122
01:06:55.301 --> 01:06:56.134
<v Speaker 5>plays that out in his conclusion is </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't break rules that you don't </v>

1123
01:06:59.651 --> 01:07:02.320
<v Speaker 5>understand because if you do something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll take you down.</v>

1124
01:07:02.530 --> 01:07:04.450
<v Speaker 5>And that's basically what happens to her</v>
<v Speaker 5>skull Nichol.</v>

1125
01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:09.370
<v Speaker 5>He kills his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the pawn broker and the pawn brokers.</v>

1126
01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:14.500
<v Speaker 5>Slave slash nice kills them with an ax.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He gets away with it,</v>

1127
01:07:15.550 --> 01:07:16.383
<v Speaker 5>he gets away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one has any idea that he does it and </v>

1128
01:07:18.221 --> 01:07:19.054
<v Speaker 5>he has access to all her money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which he promptly bernease and I think </v>

1129
01:07:21.701 --> 01:07:25.560
<v Speaker 5>in an abandoned lot and wants absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 5>nothing to do with,</v>

1130
01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:26.463
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's constantly haunted by what he's </v>

1131
01:07:27.821 --> 01:07:30.990
<v Speaker 5>done and keeps revisiting that area,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1132
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.550
<v Speaker 5>And then a prosecutor starts to suspect </v>
<v Speaker 5>him even.</v>

1133
01:07:33.551 --> 01:07:34.384
<v Speaker 5>There's no reason to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And basically subjects him to a Chinese </v>

1134
01:07:38.861 --> 01:07:39.694
<v Speaker 5>water torture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just taps him and taps him and taps </v>

1135
01:07:42.781 --> 01:07:43.614
<v Speaker 5>him and tapson and taps him until he </v>
<v Speaker 5>starts to break down and eventually can </v>

1136
01:07:46.141 --> 01:07:51.010
<v Speaker 5>facets and the cat and mouse game played</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the prosecutor and risk call Niqab is</v>

1137
01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:51.873
<v Speaker 5>absolutely psychologically terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never seen anything like that in </v>

1138
01:07:55.091 --> 01:07:55.924
<v Speaker 5>any piece of literature because </v>
<v Speaker 5>Dostoyevsky was smart enough to figure </v>

1139
01:07:58.991 --> 01:07:59.824
<v Speaker 5>out exactly how you would torment </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone with a guilty conscience and to </v>

1140
01:08:03.071 --> 01:08:03.904
<v Speaker 5>confess and the prosecutor is patient,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he just plays them like you'd play a </v>

1141
01:08:08.111 --> 01:08:08.944
<v Speaker 5>fish well and were scolding the cog </v>
<v Speaker 5>undergo so we won't worry about the end </v>

1142
01:08:13.811 --> 01:08:15.420
<v Speaker 5>of the story cause it's not that </v>
<v Speaker 5>relevant</v>

1143
01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:17.223
<v Speaker 1>in notes from underground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A similar thing happens is that this </v>

1144
01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:21.823
<v Speaker 1>narrator who is so pathological and </v>
<v Speaker 1>railing against his own cowardice and </v>

1145
01:08:24.951 --> 01:08:29.951
<v Speaker 1>his own resentment and so weakness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also not having any,</v>

1146
01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:36.080
<v Speaker 1>not granting any credence to the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a future modern utopia.</v>

1147
01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:37.333
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he tries to reconstruct his own </v>

1148
01:08:39.651 --> 01:08:40.484
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way he does that is he ends up </v>

1149
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:47.030
<v Speaker 1>in a relationship with this woman who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>been forced into prostitution,</v>

1150
01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:48.043
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a very common consequence of female </v>

1151
01:08:50.841 --> 01:08:53.360
<v Speaker 1>poverty in that era because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1152
01:08:53.361 --> 01:08:56.060
<v Speaker 1>because everyone was absolutely dirt </v>
<v Speaker 1>poor to begin with.</v>

1153
01:08:56.061 --> 01:08:59.180
<v Speaker 1>And because the alternatives were few </v>
<v Speaker 1>and far between,</v>

1154
01:08:59.181 --> 01:09:00.014
<v Speaker 1>if you fell out of your social class for</v>
<v Speaker 1>for any reason and he decides that he's </v>

1155
01:09:03.921 --> 01:09:06.470
<v Speaker 1>going to redeem her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to improve her life,</v>

1156
01:09:06.471 --> 01:09:07.304
<v Speaker 1>he's going to rescue her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the last part of the book is </v>

1157
01:09:09.291 --> 01:09:13.040
<v Speaker 1>about him trying to rescue her buddy </v>
<v Speaker 1>fails because he just doesn't,</v>

1158
01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:14.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he takes on this job,</v>

1159
01:09:14.451 --> 01:09:18.740
<v Speaker 1>which is to help someone in real trouble</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like helping someone in real trouble</v>

1160
01:09:18.741 --> 01:09:23.150
<v Speaker 1>I would say is you bloody well better be</v>
<v Speaker 1>careful before you try that because real</v>

1161
01:09:23.151 --> 01:09:24.590
<v Speaker 1>trouble is real trouble.</v>

1162
01:09:24.830 --> 01:09:28.610
<v Speaker 1>And the probability that you'll have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherewithal to help instead of making it</v>

1163
01:09:28.611 --> 01:09:30.440
<v Speaker 1>worse is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very low.</v>

1164
01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:33.110
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what happens to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sort of,</v>

1165
01:09:33.650 --> 01:09:34.483
<v Speaker 1>he attempts supposedly most both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sort of becomes narcissistic in his </v>

1166
01:09:39.141 --> 01:09:39.974
<v Speaker 1>estimation of his redemptive capability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a part of were part of him </v>

1167
01:09:43.251 --> 01:09:46.280
<v Speaker 1>is motivated by a general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a genuine desire to help.</v>

1168
01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:47.293
<v Speaker 1>But when push comes to shove,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't tolerate the responsibility </v>

1169
01:09:52.071 --> 01:09:54.560
<v Speaker 1>that would take to follow it through and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he ends up betraying her.</v>

1170
01:09:54.561 --> 01:09:57.380
<v Speaker 1>And so of course she ends up in worse </v>
<v Speaker 1>condition than she was to begin with.</v>

1171
01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:02.420
<v Speaker 1>So it's an absolutely amazing novel and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more to it.</v>

1172
01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:03.343
<v Speaker 1>And I should tell you about this too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the palace of crystal was actually a </v>

1173
01:10:06.981 --> 01:10:11.981
<v Speaker 1>reference to an actual building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the building was a building that was</v>

1174
01:10:12.471 --> 01:10:13.304
<v Speaker 1>erected in England,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in London for the world's fair that was </v>

1175
01:10:16.911 --> 01:10:17.780
<v Speaker 1>held at that point.</v>

1176
01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:21.320
<v Speaker 1>And it was the first steel and glass </v>
<v Speaker 1>building of any size.</v>

1177
01:10:21.321 --> 01:10:24.320
<v Speaker 1>And so it was a forerunner of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1178
01:10:24.321 --> 01:10:25.250
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

1179
01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:27.013
<v Speaker 1>our modern downtowns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason in part that every </v>

1180
01:10:30.651 --> 01:10:35.651
<v Speaker 1>downtown in the world looks the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it was built say between the 1950s in</v>

1181
01:10:35.901 --> 01:10:40.250
<v Speaker 1>the 1970s 1980s the seventies where in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>

1182
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:43.460
<v Speaker 1>absolutely appalling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1183
01:10:43.461 --> 01:10:45.380
<v Speaker 1>that was the new international style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1184
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:46.303
<v Speaker 1>and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was originated in Germany and it was </v>

1185
01:10:48.141 --> 01:10:53.141
<v Speaker 1>predicated on the idea that the worker </v>
<v Speaker 1>would want a bare bones structure,</v>

1186
01:10:53.211 --> 01:10:54.044
<v Speaker 1>glass tower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely devoid of in the </v>

1187
01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:58.850
<v Speaker 1>ornamentation because that was all </v>
<v Speaker 1>birdwatch nonsense.</v>

1188
01:10:59.090 --> 01:10:59.923
<v Speaker 1>And that that style should be imposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere in the world as a movement </v>

1189
01:11:02.511 --> 01:11:06.770
<v Speaker 1>towards this sort of workers utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you can see what that did.</v>

1190
01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:09.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so these,</v>

1191
01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:10.123
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you that because these </v>

1192
01:11:11.181 --> 01:11:12.014
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they stretch out and they have their </v>

1193
01:11:13.681 --> 01:11:14.880
<v Speaker 1>tentacles everywhere.</v>

1194
01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:17.670
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that new international style that was</v>

1195
01:11:17.671 --> 01:11:18.504
<v Speaker 1>certainly responsible for things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the housing projects in the United </v>

1196
01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:24.270
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which were absolute catastrophes.</v>

1197
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:25.783
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all came out of this dream up the </v>

1198
01:11:27.541 --> 01:11:30.390
<v Speaker 1>workers socialist paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1199
01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:34.680
<v Speaker 1>so Dostoevsky goes on the rampage </v>
<v Speaker 1>against that idea and on a psychological</v>

1200
01:11:34.681 --> 01:11:36.120
<v Speaker 1>basis he just says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1201
01:11:36.121 --> 01:11:36.954
<v Speaker 1>don't be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really think that human beings are </v>

1202
01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:41.730
<v Speaker 1>constructed so that if you give them </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to eat,</v>

1203
01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:43.500
<v Speaker 1>they'll be satisfied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1204
01:11:43.501 --> 01:11:44.334
<v Speaker 1>that's not what we're like at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not even close to like that were </v>

1205
01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:47.603
<v Speaker 1>full of snakes and twists and insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he makes that case very </v>

1206
01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:57.660
<v Speaker 1>straightforwardly and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only are we like that,</v>

1207
01:11:57.661 --> 01:11:58.494
<v Speaker 1>but that it's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the best thing about us that we're </v>

1208
01:12:00.211 --> 01:12:03.300
<v Speaker 1>like that some re remarkable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remarkable book.</v>

1209
01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:06.000
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1210
01:12:06.001 --> 01:12:07.230
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then we might say,</v>

1211
01:12:07.231 --> 01:12:09.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened when these utopian schemes</v>

1212
01:12:09.901 --> 01:12:10.920
<v Speaker 1>were put into action?</v>

1213
01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:12.760
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1214
01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:14.293
<v Speaker 1>and describe what happened in the Soviet</v>
<v Speaker 1>Union and the girl in the Gulag </v>

1215
01:12:16.981 --> 01:12:20.180
<v Speaker 1>archipelago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he estimated that the stent,</v>

1216
01:12:20.450 --> 01:12:25.450
<v Speaker 1>the Soviets killed 60 million people </v>
<v Speaker 1>between 1919 in 1959 roughly speaking.</v>

1217
01:12:26.581 --> 01:12:29.550
<v Speaker 1>Now people have taken them to task for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that estimate,</v>

1218
01:12:29.551 --> 01:12:33.120
<v Speaker 1>but there's no good records.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And certainly the,</v>

1219
01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:36.390
<v Speaker 1>it's between 25 and 60 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1220
01:12:36.391 --> 01:12:37.530
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1221
01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:41.730
<v Speaker 1>really does it matter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that actually the point?</v>

1222
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:45.520
<v Speaker 1>Once you're past your first 10 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've already established your,</v>

1223
01:12:45.630 --> 01:12:47.310
<v Speaker 1>your character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

1224
01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:48.171
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1225
01:12:48.171 --> 01:12:50.460
<v Speaker 1>and Stalin said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

1226
01:12:50.461 --> 01:12:53.340
<v Speaker 1>death is a tragedy and a million deaths </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a statistic,</v>

1227
01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:56.790
<v Speaker 1>which pretty much gives you some insight</v>
<v Speaker 1>into how stellan thought.</v>

1228
01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:00.780
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened in,</v>

1229
01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:02.370
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the USSR?</v>

1230
01:13:03.270 --> 01:13:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the stat for you.</v>

1231
01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:10.550
<v Speaker 1>So czar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1232
01:13:11.190 --> 01:13:15.150
<v Speaker 1>before the USSR,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia was czarist,</v>

1233
01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:16.343
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it was a monarchy like most </v>

1234
01:13:18.841 --> 01:13:19.674
<v Speaker 1>European countries were monarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except it was more futile than most </v>

1235
01:13:24.691 --> 01:13:27.540
<v Speaker 1>European countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly far more than England say,</v>

1236
01:13:27.541 --> 01:13:28.374
<v Speaker 1>or France.</v>

1237
01:13:30.150 --> 01:13:35.150
<v Speaker 1>And the radicals regarded the czar as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressor.</v>

1238
01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:39.670
<v Speaker 1>And so it was the oppression of bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 1>risks,</v>

1239
01:13:39.690 --> 01:13:40.523
<v Speaker 1>the czar and the aristocracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was partly what provided the </v>

1240
01:13:43.861 --> 01:13:44.694
<v Speaker 1>impetus for the workers slash peasants </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were mostly peasants in </v>

1241
01:13:47.791 --> 01:13:52.050
<v Speaker 1>Russia to rise up against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1242
01:13:52.410 --> 01:13:53.243
<v Speaker 1>for the sake of simplicity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're class enemies from 1825 to 19 I </v>

1243
01:14:00.721 --> 01:14:05.070
<v Speaker 1>think it was 1900 it's right around </v>
<v Speaker 1>1,975 years.</v>

1244
01:14:05.670 --> 01:14:06.503
<v Speaker 1>The czar tourists sentence 6,000 people </v>
<v Speaker 1>to death for political crimes and </v>

1245
01:14:10.651 --> 01:14:11.484
<v Speaker 1>executed thousand in the years for 1919 </v>
<v Speaker 1>to 1959 the communists killed 30 </v>

1246
01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:19.773
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when we're thinking about the </v>

1247
01:14:21.761 --> 01:14:22.594
<v Speaker 1>communist revolution as a revolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>against tyranny and a justifiable </v>

1248
01:14:26.081 --> 01:14:26.914
<v Speaker 1>revolution against tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should be very careful what it is </v>

1249
01:14:30.041 --> 01:14:32.110
<v Speaker 1>that we're defining as tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1250
01:14:32.111 --> 01:14:36.010
<v Speaker 1>if you want to know what the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>camps were like four prisoners,</v>

1251
01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:38.620
<v Speaker 1>you can read Dostoyevsky's house of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dead.</v>

1252
01:14:38.650 --> 01:14:39.483
<v Speaker 1>Because what happened to Dostoyevsky is </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was one of those people who was more </v>

1253
01:14:42.071 --> 01:14:43.480
<v Speaker 1>or less sentenced by the czar.</v>

1254
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:46.210
<v Speaker 1>He was a student radical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They throw him in prison,</v>

1255
01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:47.433
<v Speaker 1>took him out one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretended to shoot them in a firing </v>

1256
01:14:50.051 --> 01:14:51.160
<v Speaker 1>squad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>used blanks,</v>

1257
01:14:51.670 --> 01:14:52.503
<v Speaker 1>shorter them out completely there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some evidence that that's when </v>

1258
01:14:55.121 --> 01:14:58.360
<v Speaker 1>his epilepsy either started or really </v>
<v Speaker 1>became intense,</v>

1259
01:14:58.630 --> 01:15:02.530
<v Speaker 1>and then they banished him to a prison </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Siberia.</v>

1260
01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:05.890
<v Speaker 1>And the prison was full of thieves and </v>
<v Speaker 1>murderers and rapists.</v>

1261
01:15:05.891 --> 01:15:07.990
<v Speaker 1>And it was a rough place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1262
01:15:07.991 --> 01:15:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Dostoyevsky was an aristocratic guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an educated person,</v>

1263
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:13.750
<v Speaker 1>a young man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had no idea what to expect.</v>

1264
01:15:13.751 --> 01:15:15.460
<v Speaker 1>And so he wrote a book called the House </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the dead,</v>

1265
01:15:15.461 --> 01:15:16.294
<v Speaker 1>which is a very interesting book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you read the house of the dead </v>

1266
01:15:19.450 --> 01:15:20.283
<v Speaker 1>and then you read the Gulag archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think that like the house of the </v>

1267
01:15:24.791 --> 01:15:27.790
<v Speaker 1>dead was up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was up Caribbean,</v>

1268
01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Caribbean holiday camp compared to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ghoulag.</v>

1269
01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:32.313
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the prisoners in the prison camps </v>

1270
01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:38.140
<v Speaker 1>in Dostoyevsky's prison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

1271
01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:40.840
<v Speaker 1>used to go into the villages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they did,</v>

1272
01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:41.980
<v Speaker 1>they could go into the villages.</v>

1273
01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:42.813
<v Speaker 1>I mean they regarded and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they could go there to work and </v>

1274
01:15:44.831 --> 01:15:46.800
<v Speaker 1>people would come out and give them </v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

1275
01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:47.653
<v Speaker 1>Little kids would come up to them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>give them food because one of the </v>

1276
01:15:49.691 --> 01:15:50.524
<v Speaker 1>characteristics of Russian culture at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that point was that the peasants in </v>

1277
01:15:53.891 --> 01:15:58.040
<v Speaker 1>particular felt that the people who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>in prison were unfortunate,</v>

1278
01:15:58.320 --> 01:15:59.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they felt bad for them.</v>

1279
01:15:59.651 --> 01:16:02.140
<v Speaker 1>It was part of their Orthodox Christian </v>
<v Speaker 1>charity.</v>

1280
01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:05.890
<v Speaker 1>And they also felt that maybe they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>only one step from the same thing.</v>

1281
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:07.990
<v Speaker 1>And so their basic attitude was </v>
<v Speaker 1>charitable.</v>

1282
01:16:07.991 --> 01:16:10.390
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were fed in the prisons.</v>

1283
01:16:10.391 --> 01:16:10.901
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1284
01:16:10.901 --> 01:16:15.901
<v Speaker 1>it was hardly gourmet fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course everybody was so damn poor</v>

1285
01:16:15.911 --> 01:16:18.570
<v Speaker 1>at that time that that's not even a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable comparison.</v>

1286
01:16:18.571 --> 01:16:20.440
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was rough,</v>

1287
01:16:20.441 --> 01:16:21.274
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't the most imaginative Roth you </v>

1288
01:16:24.281 --> 01:16:25.114
<v Speaker 1>could possibly imagine for the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>pointless possible purpose ending up in </v>

1289
01:16:28.871 --> 01:16:31.420
<v Speaker 1>your death and likely your family's </v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

1290
01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:33.610
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1291
01:16:33.611 --> 01:16:35.770
<v Speaker 1>you got out of those camps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got out,</v>

1292
01:16:35.771 --> 01:16:37.930
<v Speaker 1>you do your sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they would let you go.</v>

1293
01:16:37.931 --> 01:16:40.720
<v Speaker 1>They might exile you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even if you were Exxon,</v>

1294
01:16:40.721 --> 01:16:41.554
<v Speaker 1>you could have a life there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was the extent of the judicial </v>

1295
01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:50.860
<v Speaker 1>and penitential tyranny of the czars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1296
01:16:50.890 --> 01:16:51.723
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that the czarist system </v>

1297
01:16:53.471 --> 01:16:58.471
<v Speaker 1>was all sweetness and light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that's relevant.</v>

1298
01:16:58.930 --> 01:16:59.763
<v Speaker 1>It was part of the feudal system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had developed organically in some </v>

1299
01:17:02.591 --> 01:17:03.424
<v Speaker 1>sense across history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Russians were sort of on the slow </v>

1300
01:17:06.641 --> 01:17:09.070
<v Speaker 1>end of the developmental curve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1301
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:13.970
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't handled a lot better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>what came afterwards.</v>

1302
01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:18.920
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the,</v>

1303
01:17:19.090 --> 01:17:23.220
<v Speaker 1>the Soviets after Lenin took over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now landon stepped in when,</v>

1304
01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:25.700
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Lennon stepped in to take power,</v>

1305
01:17:25.730 --> 01:17:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Russia was basically in chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What had happened was World War One,</v>

1306
01:17:30.921 --> 01:17:31.754
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1307
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:32.863
<v Speaker 1>a frenzy of insanity and basically mark </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the monarchical system in </v>

1308
01:17:36.921 --> 01:17:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>

1309
01:17:37.610 --> 01:17:39.080
<v Speaker 1>It also marked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1310
01:17:39.081 --> 01:17:39.914
<v Speaker 1>the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fragmentation of the Middle </v>

1311
01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:44.113
<v Speaker 1>East.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so part of the reason that the </v>

1312
01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:46.123
<v Speaker 1>Middle East is parsed up the way it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>today is because the Ottoman empire </v>

1313
01:17:48.351 --> 01:17:49.184
<v Speaker 1>collapsed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>England and France still had some </v>

1314
01:17:50.991 --> 01:17:51.824
<v Speaker 1>dominion there as victors in World War </v>
<v Speaker 1>One and they created the Middle Eastern </v>

1315
01:17:55.131 --> 01:17:57.440
<v Speaker 1>countries out of the wreckage of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ottoman empire.</v>

1316
01:17:57.650 --> 01:17:58.131
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1317
01:17:58.131 --> 01:18:00.620
<v Speaker 1>we're still playing out the consequences</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>

1318
01:18:00.621 --> 01:18:03.440
<v Speaker 1>but it's something useful to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how that came about.</v>

1319
01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:04.333
<v Speaker 1>The empire collapsed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all the monarchical empires </v>

1320
01:18:06.711 --> 01:18:08.780
<v Speaker 1>essentially collapsed after World War </v>
<v Speaker 1>One.</v>

1321
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Russia was devastated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the soldiers were,</v>

1322
01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:16.430
<v Speaker 1>were deserting the trenches on Mohs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming home.</v>

1323
01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:17.583
<v Speaker 1>Part of it because the czar had </v>
<v Speaker 1>abdicated after he took control of the </v>

1324
01:18:19.971 --> 01:18:22.490
<v Speaker 1>armed forces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things went south even further,</v>

1325
01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:23.413
<v Speaker 1>he abdicated and the new parliament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was sort of half democratic and </v>

1326
01:18:26.581 --> 01:18:31.250
<v Speaker 1>half socialist I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was starting to divide up the land among</v>

1327
01:18:31.251 --> 01:18:32.084
<v Speaker 1>the peasants.</v>

1328
01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:33.013
<v Speaker 1>And so the soldiers were very motivated </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get the hell home so that they could </v>

1329
01:18:35.511 --> 01:18:37.520
<v Speaker 1>get some of this land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the whole country,</v>

1330
01:18:37.950 --> 01:18:42.950
<v Speaker 1>the overarching political system had </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapsed and the Russians were starting</v>

1331
01:18:42.981 --> 01:18:45.530
<v Speaker 1>to organize themselves from the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 1>up at that point.</v>

1332
01:18:45.770 --> 01:18:48.790
<v Speaker 1>And there was the hints of a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>governmental structure in,</v>

1333
01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:52.760
<v Speaker 1>in Moscow in this was this democratic </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialist alliance,</v>

1334
01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:53.953
<v Speaker 1>but there was still a terrible power </v>
<v Speaker 1>vacuum and the central authorities in </v>

1335
01:18:58.071 --> 01:18:58.904
<v Speaker 1>Moscow never really seem to get control </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the country and it was into that </v>

1336
01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:03.920
<v Speaker 1>mass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Lennon step.</v>

1337
01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:05.780
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1338
01:19:05.781 --> 01:19:08.810
<v Speaker 1>sometimes when there's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily chaotic situation,</v>

1339
01:19:08.811 --> 01:19:11.240
<v Speaker 1>it just takes one seat of orders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

1340
01:19:11.241 --> 01:19:12.074
<v Speaker 1>to spread itself out everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the Yin and Yang symbol and </v>

1341
01:19:14.211 --> 01:19:15.044
<v Speaker 1>that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so the Marxist idea was that the </v>

1342
01:19:20.631 --> 01:19:24.200
<v Speaker 1>thing that made people's lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>intolerable was basically differences in</v>

1343
01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:29.120
<v Speaker 1>distribution that had been stabilized </v>
<v Speaker 1>into class differences.</v>

1344
01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:30.073
<v Speaker 1>And so the classes were basically that </v>
<v Speaker 1>proletariat and the bourgeoisie and the </v>

1345
01:19:33.531 --> 01:19:34.970
<v Speaker 1>virtual Z,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're the owners.</v>

1346
01:19:35.390 --> 01:19:36.223
<v Speaker 1>And so if you owned anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the theory was that since everything of </v>

1347
01:19:41.841 --> 01:19:42.674
<v Speaker 1>value was created by workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way you could have any excess </v>

1348
01:19:46.581 --> 01:19:50.420
<v Speaker 1>value was essentially if you stole it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you took it.</v>

1349
01:19:50.421 --> 01:19:54.200
<v Speaker 1>So you were by definition an oppressor </v>
<v Speaker 1>by definition.</v>

1350
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:55.663
<v Speaker 1>And that part of the move towards the </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialist utopia was that the Burj waze </v>

1351
01:20:02.331 --> 01:20:03.164
<v Speaker 1>would dissolve as a class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that the communists were a little </v>

1352
01:20:07.050 --> 01:20:10.710
<v Speaker 1>impatient for the spontaneous </v>
<v Speaker 1>dissolution of the bourgeoisie.</v>

1353
01:20:10.830 --> 01:20:15.090
<v Speaker 1>So what they decided to do was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>proactively dissolved it.</v>

1354
01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:16.313
<v Speaker 1>And so what the Nazis did to the Jews </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other people that they </v>

1355
01:20:19.801 --> 01:20:24.180
<v Speaker 1>persecuted for the manner in which they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were born,</v>

1356
01:20:24.181 --> 01:20:25.014
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Communists did to people who to </v>

1357
01:20:27.751 --> 01:20:28.584
<v Speaker 1>people by class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so essentially if you were educated </v>

1358
01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:33.383
<v Speaker 1>and you own any property or if someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>just didn't like you and you were a </v>

1359
01:20:36.871 --> 01:20:39.030
<v Speaker 1>little richer than anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone else,</v>

1360
01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:40.800
<v Speaker 1>you were going to be dead.</v>

1361
01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:46.670
<v Speaker 1>And so they sent wave after wave of </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical brutalized,</v>

1362
01:20:47.130 --> 01:20:47.963
<v Speaker 1>resentful mobs into the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>countryside and raped and pillaged and </v>

1363
01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:55.973
<v Speaker 1>killed everyone who was competent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so part of that was direct so that </v>

1364
01:21:02.701 --> 01:21:03.534
<v Speaker 1>you know a mob would storm your house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you have to understand that often </v>

1365
01:21:06.391 --> 01:21:07.224
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these outside agitators came into the </v>

1366
01:21:08.431 --> 01:21:09.264
<v Speaker 1>village.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was enough outside agitator so </v>

1367
01:21:10.471 --> 01:21:12.480
<v Speaker 1>that they could do the storming by </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

1368
01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:17.190
<v Speaker 1>but they would pick up adherence in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>village and those would be the adherence</v>

1369
01:21:17.191 --> 01:21:19.830
<v Speaker 1>who wanted to go out to someone's house </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1370
01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:24.480
<v Speaker 1>strip it of all its valuables and have </v>
<v Speaker 1>their way with the people inside.</v>

1371
01:21:24.481 --> 01:21:25.314
<v Speaker 1>And so you can imagine what sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that attracted the obviously the </v>

1372
01:21:28.051 --> 01:21:28.884
<v Speaker 1>highest quality of person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they'd go out to a Kulak house </v>

1373
01:21:32.011 --> 01:21:32.844
<v Speaker 1>and surrounded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now often the peasants would fight them </v>

1374
01:21:35.731 --> 01:21:39.210
<v Speaker 1>off with pitchforks trying to defend the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people inside the house.</v>

1375
01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:40.860
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that works sometime.</v>

1376
01:21:40.861 --> 01:21:41.694
<v Speaker 1>But most of the time it didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they'd go in and they take </v>

1377
01:21:43.621 --> 01:21:44.454
<v Speaker 1>everything absolutely everything out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the house and leave it with nothing and </v>

1378
01:21:48.931 --> 01:21:52.980
<v Speaker 1>then leave the people with nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then eventually those people,</v>

1379
01:21:52.981 --> 01:21:54.990
<v Speaker 1>the ones that survived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which weren't that many,</v>

1380
01:21:55.530 --> 01:21:56.363
<v Speaker 1>the government offered them the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to be taken out to Siberia </v>

1381
01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:00.113
<v Speaker 1>to start a new life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could bring two months worth of </v>

1382
01:22:01.951 --> 01:22:02.784
<v Speaker 1>food in their families and go out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But of course they didn't have two </v>

1383
01:22:04.921 --> 01:22:07.380
<v Speaker 1>months worth of food because everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>had been stolen from them.</v>

1384
01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:09.840
<v Speaker 1>And then when they go out to Siberia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was nothing left,</v>

1385
01:22:09.930 --> 01:22:10.763
<v Speaker 1>nothing there except crowded camps that </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately produced typhus and killed </v>

1386
01:22:13.891 --> 01:22:16.200
<v Speaker 1>all the children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was,</v>

1387
01:22:16.290 --> 01:22:18.540
<v Speaker 1>that was the beginning of the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>

1388
01:22:18.541 --> 01:22:20.820
<v Speaker 1>And it was lennon who did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>

1389
01:22:20.821 --> 01:22:24.720
<v Speaker 1>if you read communist revisionists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll basically say,</v>

1390
01:22:24.721 --> 01:22:25.554
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things were going all hunky dory under </v>

1391
01:22:26.581 --> 01:22:29.040
<v Speaker 1>Lennon because he had everyone's best </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest in mind.</v>

1392
01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:30.450
<v Speaker 1>And then that monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stalin,</v>

1393
01:22:30.690 --> 01:22:32.010
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>control of the party.</v>

1394
01:22:32.011 --> 01:22:32.844
<v Speaker 1>And that's when it became a cult of </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality that had nothing to do with </v>

1395
01:22:35.521 --> 01:22:36.960
<v Speaker 1>true communism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1396
01:22:36.961 --> 01:22:41.550
<v Speaker 1>that's the rationale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Lennon was just as good a monster.</v>

1397
01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:42.393
<v Speaker 1>Astella he just didn't live very long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He died in about 1920 to 1923 something </v>

1398
01:22:46.681 --> 01:22:47.514
<v Speaker 1>around that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He'd already produced style and as </v>

1399
01:22:49.711 --> 01:22:52.800
<v Speaker 1>his followup monster at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1400
01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:53.634
<v Speaker 1>and that was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things just barely got going at that </v>

1401
01:22:55.891 --> 01:22:56.724
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1402
01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:00.000
<v Speaker 1>the next thing was after they got rid of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the Kulaks,</v>

1403
01:23:00.001 --> 01:23:03.660
<v Speaker 1>they collectivize the farms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which meant if you had a farm,</v>

1404
01:23:03.661 --> 01:23:06.130
<v Speaker 1>you're some damn peasant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just got some</v>

1405
01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:07.750
<v Speaker 5>land,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1406
01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:10.330
<v Speaker 5>because your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your parents were basically,</v>

1407
01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:12.610
<v Speaker 5>they weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were basically slaves.</v>

1408
01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:15.160
<v Speaker 5>For all intents and purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were attached to the land.</v>

1409
01:23:15.161 --> 01:23:15.994
<v Speaker 5>And so you just got some land and some </v>
<v Speaker 5>of you were smart enough so that you </v>

1410
01:23:18.461 --> 01:23:19.294
<v Speaker 5>made something out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You were growing food at the same time </v>

1411
01:23:21.581 --> 01:23:23.470
<v Speaker 5>to feed everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1412
01:23:23.471 --> 01:23:24.460
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in any,</v>

1413
01:23:25.150 --> 01:23:28.960
<v Speaker 5>in any creative enterprise,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any creative enterprise whatsoever,</v>

1414
01:23:29.050 --> 01:23:32.170
<v Speaker 5>it's a minority of the people who do all</v>
<v Speaker 5>the productive work.</v>

1415
01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:33.041
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1416
01:23:33.041 --> 01:23:35.920
<v Speaker 5>if you have a hundred farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>10 of them grow half the food.</v>

1417
01:23:35.921 --> 01:23:38.950
<v Speaker 5>If you have a thousand farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>30 of them grow half the food.</v>

1418
01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:42.550
<v Speaker 5>So you go out there and you wipe out </v>
<v Speaker 5>your most productive people.</v>

1419
01:23:42.551 --> 01:23:44.560
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well guess what happens next?</v>

1420
01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:45.873
<v Speaker 5>Well you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you wipe them out and then you forcibly </v>

1421
01:23:47.651 --> 01:23:51.460
<v Speaker 5>collectivize and so everyone who had </v>
<v Speaker 5>nothing and who is completely useless,</v>

1422
01:23:51.461 --> 01:23:54.700
<v Speaker 5>it's thrilled about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the next thing that happens as well,</v>

1423
01:23:54.730 --> 01:23:56.050
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't grow any crops.</v>

1424
01:23:57.550 --> 01:24:01.180
<v Speaker 5>And so that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Food production plummeted.</v>

1425
01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:02.613
<v Speaker 5>And then</v>

1426
01:24:04.350 --> 01:24:04.690
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1427
01:24:04.690 --> 01:24:05.523
<v Speaker 5>for a variety of reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the central Soviets weren't very happy </v>

1428
01:24:07.931 --> 01:24:08.764
<v Speaker 5>with the Ukrainians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so what they decided was that they </v>

1429
01:24:10.391 --> 01:24:12.950
<v Speaker 5>were going to take all the food that the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ukrainian collected,</v>

1430
01:24:12.951 --> 01:24:13.784
<v Speaker 5>this farmers managed to grow anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which wasn't very much and ship it to </v>

1431
01:24:16.571 --> 01:24:17.404
<v Speaker 5>the cities.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so they did that and then they </v>

1432
01:24:19.211 --> 01:24:20.044
<v Speaker 5>pursue prosecuted women who would go out</v>
<v Speaker 5>into the fields with their children to </v>

1433
01:24:23.111 --> 01:24:23.944
<v Speaker 5>pick up individual grains of wheat that </v>
<v Speaker 5>the gleaners that the threshers had </v>

1434
01:24:28.241 --> 01:24:30.460
<v Speaker 5>missed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the punishment for that was that you</v>

1435
01:24:30.461 --> 01:24:31.294
<v Speaker 5>were incarcerated in a death camp and so</v>
<v Speaker 5>6 million Ukrainian starved and </v>

1436
01:24:35.650 --> 01:24:36.483
<v Speaker 5>cannibalism was so rife in the Ukraine </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the 1930s that the Soviet government </v>

1437
01:24:39.671 --> 01:24:43.120
<v Speaker 5>printed posters saying it is barbaric to</v>
<v Speaker 5>eat your children.</v>

1438
01:24:44.170 --> 01:24:46.540
<v Speaker 5>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well that's a little too little,</v>

1439
01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:50.350
<v Speaker 5>a little too late.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that was the first 6 million deaths,</v>

1440
01:24:50.380 --> 01:24:55.380
<v Speaker 5>not counting all the Russian civil war </v>
<v Speaker 5>and all the desks that went along there.</v>

1441
01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:57.760
<v Speaker 5>And that just basically got the ball </v>
<v Speaker 5>rolling,</v>

1442
01:24:58.290 --> 01:24:58.691
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1443
01:24:58.691 --> 01:24:59.524
<v Speaker 5>that was happening that the Gulag camps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that style or that Solzhenitsyn wrote </v>

1444
01:25:03.461 --> 01:25:04.294
<v Speaker 5>about were well onto being established.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's where it was in slave labor </v>

1445
01:25:08.141 --> 01:25:08.974
<v Speaker 5>camps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>roughly speaking that the Soviets </v>

1446
01:25:10.541 --> 01:25:11.374
<v Speaker 5>produced enough of their economic goods </v>
<v Speaker 5>to keep lumbering along with these </v>

1447
01:25:14.831 --> 01:25:19.180
<v Speaker 5>forest five year plan projects that made</v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone into a liar.</v>

1448
01:25:19.450 --> 01:25:21.160
<v Speaker 5>And so that's the next part of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>story.</v>

1449
01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:22.293
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

1450
01:25:25.230 --> 01:25:28.640
<v Speaker 5>Solzhenitsyn probably has done a better </v>
<v Speaker 5>job of documenting this than anyone else</v>

1451
01:25:28.641 --> 01:25:30.890
<v Speaker 5>I ever read,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

1452
01:25:30.891 --> 01:25:33.230
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's also something that orwell talked a</v>

1453
01:25:33.231 --> 01:25:34.370
<v Speaker 5>lot about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1454
01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:38.660
<v Speaker 5>I think that the best introduction to </v>
<v Speaker 5>this idea is probably 1984,</v>

1455
01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:40.280
<v Speaker 5>because it's a short book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1456
01:25:40.910 --> 01:25:43.700
<v Speaker 5>and basically what happens in 1984 is </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>

1457
01:25:43.710 --> 01:25:46.400
<v Speaker 5>it's a satire of communist </v>
<v Speaker 5>totalitarianism,</v>

1458
01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:50.300
<v Speaker 5>clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I mean expressly,</v>

1459
01:25:50.301 --> 01:25:51.134
<v Speaker 5>that's exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And basically the rule was in the </v>

1460
01:25:54.831 --> 01:25:55.664
<v Speaker 5>society of 1984 that you are not allowed</v>
<v Speaker 5>to think or say anything that wasn't </v>

1461
01:25:58.941 --> 01:26:01.670
<v Speaker 5>part of the prevailing dogma.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Times.</v>

1462
01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:06.530
<v Speaker 5>And one of the things that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 5>1984 is that there's three big blocks,</v>

1463
01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:07.393
<v Speaker 5>power blocks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're always at war with one </v>

1464
01:26:08.811 --> 01:26:10.880
<v Speaker 5>another except who they're at war with </v>
<v Speaker 5>shift.</v>

1465
01:26:10.910 --> 01:26:14.420
<v Speaker 5>So at one point it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think one of them is called Oceana,</v>

1466
01:26:14.630 --> 01:26:17.870
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but these two power blocks are at war.</v>

1467
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:20.960
<v Speaker 5>And then all of a sudden that switches,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these two power blocks are at war.</v>

1468
01:26:20.961 --> 01:26:21.794
<v Speaker 5>And so then all the history textbooks or</v>
<v Speaker 5>revised and all the news stories or </v>

1469
01:26:24.621 --> 01:26:27.470
<v Speaker 5>revised.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's as if we were always at war with</v>

1470
01:26:27.471 --> 01:26:29.480
<v Speaker 5>that particular block.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

1471
01:26:29.481 --> 01:26:34.170
<v Speaker 5>that can change on a whim.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so everyone is required to pair it,</v>

1472
01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:38.060
<v Speaker 5>the beliefs of the state and to praise </v>
<v Speaker 5>it continually.</v>

1473
01:26:38.061 --> 01:26:38.894
<v Speaker 5>No criticism whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And everyone in the entire state is an </v>

1474
01:26:42.831 --> 01:26:43.664
<v Speaker 5>informer or at least enough people so </v>
<v Speaker 5>that the probability that you're going </v>

1475
01:26:46.251 --> 01:26:47.084
<v Speaker 5>to get nailed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you ever say anything that you </v>

1476
01:26:48.141 --> 01:26:52.580
<v Speaker 5>actually think it's near 100% and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>informers are continually rewarded,</v>

1477
01:26:52.970 --> 01:26:55.010
<v Speaker 5>which is exactly what happened in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Soviet Union.</v>

1478
01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:56.083
<v Speaker 5>So if you were some nasty bit of work </v>
<v Speaker 5>with your three families in your 150 </v>

1479
01:26:59.991 --> 01:27:00.824
<v Speaker 5>square foot apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which would have been about what you </v>

1480
01:27:02.091 --> 01:27:02.924
<v Speaker 5>could expect and you were hoping that </v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe your son and daughter could have </v>

1481
01:27:05.571 --> 01:27:06.404
<v Speaker 5>their own place and you saw someone down</v>
<v Speaker 5>the hallway that you didn't like or had </v>

1482
01:27:09.531 --> 01:27:10.364
<v Speaker 5>an animus against her or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>couple of words to the proper </v>

1483
01:27:14.421 --> 01:27:15.020
<v Speaker 5>authorities.</v>

1484
01:27:15.020 --> 01:27:15.853
<v Speaker 5>And they come charging in at two in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>morning with their Jack boots and you </v>

1485
01:27:18.231 --> 01:27:19.970
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take everyone out,</v>

1486
01:27:19.971 --> 01:27:22.700
<v Speaker 5>bring them to the central prison,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shave them balled,</v>

1487
01:27:22.701 --> 01:27:25.850
<v Speaker 5>strip them of their clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>put them in ill fitting uniform,</v>

1488
01:27:25.851 --> 01:27:29.210
<v Speaker 5>and they were gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you've got their apartment.</v>

1489
01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:32.390
<v Speaker 5>So that was the basis of the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 5>state.</v>

1490
01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:34.190
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1491
01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:37.340
<v Speaker 5>you should just imagine for a while what</v>
<v Speaker 5>that would be like.</v>

1492
01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:39.620
<v Speaker 5>And so one of soldiering instance </v>
<v Speaker 5>points,</v>

1493
01:27:39.621 --> 01:27:41.750
<v Speaker 5>and this was something that was echoed </v>
<v Speaker 5>by Viktor Frankl,</v>

1494
01:27:41.751 --> 01:27:44.780
<v Speaker 5>but soldier knits and does the best job </v>
<v Speaker 5>of documenting this,</v>

1495
01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:47.630
<v Speaker 5>was that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

1496
01:27:47.631 --> 01:27:51.530
<v Speaker 5>he takes the Marxists presuppositions as</v>
<v Speaker 5>a set of axioms.</v>

1497
01:27:52.130 --> 01:27:53.930
<v Speaker 5>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1498
01:27:53.931 --> 01:27:57.950
<v Speaker 5>one possibility is that these axioms </v>
<v Speaker 5>were never put into practice property.</v>

1499
01:27:58.430 --> 01:28:00.410
<v Speaker 5>So let's look at that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he says,</v>

1500
01:28:00.411 --> 01:28:01.071
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1501
01:28:01.071 --> 01:28:01.904
<v Speaker 5>there's a couple of problems with that </v>
<v Speaker 5>because here's how the axioms were put </v>

1502
01:28:04.051 --> 01:28:04.884
<v Speaker 5>into practice in the Soviet Union </v>
<v Speaker 5>directly as a consequence of the </v>

1503
01:28:09.171 --> 01:28:12.410
<v Speaker 5>accident themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is like private property is theft.</v>

1504
01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:14.720
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Burj waze is a,</v>

1505
01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:19.460
<v Speaker 5>is a parasitical class that um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1506
01:28:19.461 --> 01:28:20.210
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1507
01:28:20.210 --> 01:28:23.000
<v Speaker 5>that everything should be collectivized </v>
<v Speaker 5>in equal among everyone.</v>

1508
01:28:23.001 --> 01:28:23.834
<v Speaker 5>Those are the basic presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that was exactly what was put into </v>

1509
01:28:26.361 --> 01:28:28.880
<v Speaker 5>practice and used as justification for </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything they did.</v>

1510
01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:31.880
<v Speaker 5>So that's a non starter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he also points out,</v>

1511
01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:32.893
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't just have the Soviet Union as </v>

1512
01:28:34.671 --> 01:28:36.920
<v Speaker 5>an example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have the Soviet Union,</v>

1513
01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:39.410
<v Speaker 5>we have China,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was even worse.</v>

1514
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:42.830
<v Speaker 5>We have Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have Cambodia where Pol Pot,</v>

1515
01:28:42.831 --> 01:28:43.664
<v Speaker 5>who was trained in France at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Sorbonne by French left wing </v>

1516
01:28:46.131 --> 01:28:46.964
<v Speaker 5>intellectuals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>went back through everyone out of the </v>

1517
01:28:48.861 --> 01:28:53.570
<v Speaker 5>city and killed one in four people in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Cambodia in the space of about 10 years.</v>

1518
01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:55.760
<v Speaker 5>And then of course we still have North </v>
<v Speaker 5>Korea.</v>

1519
01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:56.773
<v Speaker 5>And we also have the fact that the only </v>
<v Speaker 5>countries in Africa that suffered like </v>

1520
01:29:01.290 --> 01:29:02.123
<v Speaker 5>deadly famines in the 20th century were </v>
<v Speaker 5>those that were running by communist </v>

1521
01:29:05.011 --> 01:29:05.844
<v Speaker 5>dictators.</v>

1522
01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:09.390
<v Speaker 5>So how much he evidence do you need?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1523
01:29:09.391 --> 01:29:11.790
<v Speaker 5>and so people say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I've had people say this to me,</v>

1524
01:29:11.791 --> 01:29:12.270
<v Speaker 5>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1525
01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:13.103
<v Speaker 5>that wasn't true communism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think what that means is that </v>

1526
01:29:15.871 --> 01:29:20.580
<v Speaker 5>person has the following delusion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they were the leader of the Communist</v>

1527
01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:23.580
<v Speaker 5>Party at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>things would have turned out better.</v>

1528
01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:27.300
<v Speaker 5>And the probability of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

1529
01:29:27.301 --> 01:29:29.340
<v Speaker 5>if you were the sort of person who was </v>
<v Speaker 5>good,</v>

1530
01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:30.953
<v Speaker 5>the chance that you would live through </v>
<v Speaker 5>the massacres and get to the top was </v>

1531
01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:37.380
<v Speaker 5>zero.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There wasn't a chance of that,</v>

1532
01:29:37.770 --> 01:29:40.260
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the system basically produced its own</v>

1533
01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:45.090
<v Speaker 5>breed of horrible monster to lead it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there is no standing in its way.</v>

1534
01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:46.133
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you had an iota of compassion and </v>

1535
01:29:49.021 --> 01:29:51.290
<v Speaker 5>dared to express that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1536
01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:52.433
<v Speaker 5>think about what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you stand up in a system like that </v>

1537
01:29:55.381 --> 01:29:56.214
<v Speaker 5>and act compassionately,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're an immediate judge of every </v>

1538
01:29:59.011 --> 01:30:01.290
<v Speaker 5>single person around you who doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to do that.</v>

1539
01:30:01.650 --> 01:30:03.480
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to live through that,</v>

1540
01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:04.710
<v Speaker 5>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1541
01:30:04.711 --> 01:30:07.500
<v Speaker 5>they'll kick call you an enemy of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>state or whatever the hell it is.</v>

1542
01:30:07.590 --> 01:30:12.570
<v Speaker 5>You're going to be gone in no time flat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what soldier Nixon,</v>

1543
01:30:12.630 --> 01:30:13.351
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1544
01:30:13.351 --> 01:30:14.184
<v Speaker 5>so orwell made the proposition that </v>
<v Speaker 5>states like that could only exist if </v>

1545
01:30:18.571 --> 01:30:19.404
<v Speaker 5>everyone in them was trained to lie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the training was the idea of </v>

1546
01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:24.473
<v Speaker 5>training isn't exactly orwell's notion </v>
<v Speaker 5>willing to and punish if they did both </v>

1547
01:30:30.151 --> 01:30:30.984
<v Speaker 5>of those at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so that's where the idea of </v>

1548
01:30:33.151 --> 01:30:35.370
<v Speaker 5>Orwellian doublespeak comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1549
01:30:35.371 --> 01:30:37.170
<v Speaker 5>and that's when you say one thing but </v>
<v Speaker 5>mean another.</v>

1550
01:30:37.171 --> 01:30:39.660
<v Speaker 5>You say something that is in accordance </v>
<v Speaker 5>with the,</v>

1551
01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:41.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the tenants of the time,</v>

1552
01:30:41.670 --> 01:30:45.390
<v Speaker 5>but it's a euphemism to cover up </v>
<v Speaker 5>something terrible that's going on.</v>

1553
01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:46.793
<v Speaker 5>And so 1984 with the story of a person </v>
<v Speaker 5>who basically gets tangled up in that </v>

1554
01:30:52.111 --> 01:30:52.944
<v Speaker 5>and they find his worst fear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's afraid of rats and they punish him </v>

1555
01:30:57.031 --> 01:30:57.990
<v Speaker 5>with his worst fear.</v>

1556
01:30:57.990 --> 01:30:59.790
<v Speaker 5>And the way they punish him is by </v>
<v Speaker 5>putting a,</v>

1557
01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:02.010
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a muscle,</v>

1558
01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:05.310
<v Speaker 5>like a goalie mask or like an umpire's </v>
<v Speaker 5>mask on his face,</v>

1559
01:31:05.311 --> 01:31:08.850
<v Speaker 5>except it's this long.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they put a starving rack inside that</v>

1560
01:31:08.851 --> 01:31:13.470
<v Speaker 5>and tie it to his head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so that's 1984.</v>

1561
01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:17.760
<v Speaker 5>But that's exactly the sort of thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>that happened in the ghoulag prisons.</v>

1562
01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:18.793
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean perhaps not the rap thing </v>

1563
01:31:20.491 --> 01:31:22.080
<v Speaker 5>precisely,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't really matter.</v>

1564
01:31:22.350 --> 01:31:23.183
<v Speaker 5>And the other thing the Soviets did was </v>
<v Speaker 5>that if they throw you in one of their </v>

1565
01:31:25.771 --> 01:31:26.604
<v Speaker 5>prison camps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you had to sign a confession admitting </v>

1566
01:31:28.351 --> 01:31:29.184
<v Speaker 5>that you were wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was its own particular kind of </v>

1567
01:31:31.561 --> 01:31:32.630
<v Speaker 5>evil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1568
01:31:32.650 --> 01:31:35.200
<v Speaker 5>the Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they gathered you up and</v>

1569
01:31:36.780 --> 01:31:39.750
<v Speaker 5>the lines were clear cut,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was irrelevant.</v>

1570
01:31:39.870 --> 01:31:42.990
<v Speaker 5>Your innocence or guilt as a person was </v>
<v Speaker 5>irrelevant.</v>

1571
01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:44.033
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you were the member of a racial group </v>

1572
01:31:45.361 --> 01:31:47.550
<v Speaker 5>deemed unacceptable and so you were </v>
<v Speaker 5>dead.</v>

1573
01:31:47.551 --> 01:31:48.384
<v Speaker 5>But the Soviets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they actually managed to figure out how </v>

1574
01:31:49.861 --> 01:31:54.390
<v Speaker 5>to make that even worse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that not only were you destroyed as a</v>

1575
01:31:54.391 --> 01:31:57.510
<v Speaker 5>consequence of your birth but class,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not race,</v>

1576
01:31:58.020 --> 01:32:00.100
<v Speaker 5>but you had to also that you</v>

1577
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:03.010
<v Speaker 1>are an enemy of the state and sign that </v>
<v Speaker 1>before they would kill you.</v>

1578
01:32:03.130 --> 01:32:05.430
<v Speaker 1>And so most people did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm surprising,</v>

1579
01:32:05.910 --> 01:32:07.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were people who didn't,</v>

1580
01:32:07.181 --> 01:32:10.600
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were few and far between.</v>

1581
01:32:10.750 --> 01:32:14.050
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course that's not surprising.</v>

1582
01:32:14.190 --> 01:32:16.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much punishment do you think someone</v>

1583
01:32:16.571 --> 01:32:17.404
<v Speaker 1>can take and soldier Nixon's book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are stories of people who didn't </v>

1584
01:32:20.591 --> 01:32:21.810
<v Speaker 1>give in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1585
01:32:21.850 --> 01:32:24.280
<v Speaker 1>and those people are so damn tough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just can't even,</v>

1586
01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:25.653
<v Speaker 1>he said that was actually what transform</v>
<v Speaker 1>social and it's an an accounts cause he </v>

1587
01:32:27.971 --> 01:32:29.320
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1588
01:32:29.321 --> 01:32:30.154
<v Speaker 1>a moderately committed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although somewhat cynical communist on </v>

1589
01:32:32.981 --> 01:32:37.120
<v Speaker 1>entry into the counts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then he saw people in there who were</v>

1590
01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:38.073
<v Speaker 1>absolutely unwilling to falsify any of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their experience and lie no matter what </v>

1591
01:32:42.851 --> 01:32:45.490
<v Speaker 1>happened to them under any conditions </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>

1592
01:32:45.850 --> 01:32:46.683
<v Speaker 1>And he was so amazed by that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it actually produced a </v>

1593
01:32:50.861 --> 01:32:52.330
<v Speaker 1>transformation in this character.</v>

1594
01:32:52.330 --> 01:32:53.163
<v Speaker 1>And part of what the Gulag archipelago </v>
<v Speaker 1>is about is exactly that transformation </v>

1595
01:32:56.530 --> 01:32:57.363
<v Speaker 1>and his discovery of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you might describe as the </v>

1596
01:32:59.711 --> 01:33:03.970
<v Speaker 1>individual responsibility to truth in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the face of state tyranny,</v>

1597
01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:05.433
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and soldier Knutson's basic conclusion </v>

1598
01:33:07.091 --> 01:33:07.924
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a conclusion by the way the </v>

1599
01:33:09.371 --> 01:33:12.460
<v Speaker 1>Dostoyevsky had drawn 70 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>previously,</v>

1600
01:33:12.730 --> 01:33:17.680
<v Speaker 1>was that an individual who stops lying </v>
<v Speaker 1>could bring down a totalitarian state.</v>

1601
01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:19.653
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a very interesting claim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Cause Solzhenitsyn's inclusion from </v>

1602
01:33:23.381 --> 01:33:27.190
<v Speaker 1>his detailed analysis and all his </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal experience inside the camps was</v>

1603
01:33:27.191 --> 01:33:30.400
<v Speaker 1>that no matter how powerful the </v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian state was,</v>

1604
01:33:30.401 --> 01:33:34.030
<v Speaker 1>that in the final analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't stand up to actual truth.</v>

1605
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:36.183
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a very radical plane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's born out in part by his </v>

1606
01:33:40.471 --> 01:33:41.304
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of course Solzhenitsyn did tell </v>

1607
01:33:42.661 --> 01:33:43.494
<v Speaker 1>the truth and his book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Gulag Archipelago was one of the </v>

1608
01:33:47.491 --> 01:33:50.310
<v Speaker 1>things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it was the book,</v>

1609
01:33:50.311 --> 01:33:53.970
<v Speaker 1>but demolished the credibility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>communism as a political structure.</v>

1610
01:33:54.810 --> 01:33:55.830
<v Speaker 1>So he managed it.</v>

1611
01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:57.333
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1612
01:34:00.210 --> 01:34:04.650
<v Speaker 1>The first book that he wrote called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>a day in the life of Viabahn,</v>

1613
01:34:04.650 --> 01:34:05.483
<v Speaker 1>Denisovich was published in 1962 so what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened was Stalin died or was killed </v>

1614
01:34:10.621 --> 01:34:11.454
<v Speaker 1>in the late 1950s I think it was in 1957</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was somewhere between 1957 in </v>

1615
01:34:16.561 --> 01:34:17.394
<v Speaker 1>1959 and cruise chef took over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's some evidence that </v>

1616
01:34:20.461 --> 01:34:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Khrushchev and two other people killed </v>
<v Speaker 1>stolen because they thought it was going</v>

1617
01:34:23.611 --> 01:34:25.710
<v Speaker 1>to invade Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is hydrogen bombs.</v>

1618
01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:27.293
<v Speaker 1>And started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it already demonstrated quite clearly </v>

1619
01:34:28.741 --> 01:34:29.930
<v Speaker 1>that if he had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1620
01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:31.013
<v Speaker 1>drop a hydrogen bomb on Paris in London </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make sure that the Europeans got the </v>

1621
01:34:33.751 --> 01:34:34.584
<v Speaker 1>hell out of the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that wasn't something that was </v>

1622
01:34:35.671 --> 01:34:37.920
<v Speaker 1>certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was certainly willing to do.</v>

1623
01:34:40.170 --> 01:34:41.003
<v Speaker 1>So Khrushchev was one of the people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was involved at Stalin's death and he </v>

1624
01:34:43.561 --> 01:34:45.630
<v Speaker 1>took over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but cruise ship was also one of the main</v>

1625
01:34:45.631 --> 01:34:46.464
<v Speaker 1>architects of the Ukrainian famine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Khrushchev had actually developed a </v>

1626
01:34:49.531 --> 01:34:50.364
<v Speaker 1>bit of a conscience about all that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he loosened things up substantially for </v>

1627
01:34:53.551 --> 01:34:55.410
<v Speaker 1>a period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for about five years.</v>

1628
01:34:55.710 --> 01:34:56.543
<v Speaker 1>And during that time social and released</v>
<v Speaker 1>a book called one day in the life of </v>

1629
01:34:59.181 --> 01:35:00.014
<v Speaker 1>Ivan Denisovich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a story about himself and it's </v>

1630
01:35:03.261 --> 01:35:08.261
<v Speaker 1>just one day in a gulag archipelago cap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a very dreary and,</v>

1631
01:35:08.850 --> 01:35:09.683
<v Speaker 1>and wretched and horrifying book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was the first of anything like </v>

1632
01:35:12.681 --> 01:35:16.400
<v Speaker 1>that that was seen in the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And add another bit of evidence that was</v>

1633
01:35:16.401 --> 01:35:17.234
<v Speaker 1>disseminated out into the West in 1962 </v>
<v Speaker 1>which the bloody French intellectuals </v>

1634
01:35:20.811 --> 01:35:22.340
<v Speaker 1>could have picked up right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then and said,</v>

1635
01:35:22.370 --> 01:35:23.720
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1636
01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:24.673
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our glorious leader has a lot more </v>

1637
01:35:26.841 --> 01:35:28.070
<v Speaker 1>problems than we think.</v>

1638
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:30.590
<v Speaker 1>But of course that never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then,</v>

1639
01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:35.300
<v Speaker 1>and Khrushchev was actually loosening up</v>
<v Speaker 1>the strictures in the,</v>

1640
01:35:35.301 --> 01:35:36.134
<v Speaker 1>in the USSR,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he got wiped out of power in a coup </v>

1641
01:35:38.481 --> 01:35:39.314
<v Speaker 1>and taken out of power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the clamps came back down and </v>

1642
01:35:42.190 --> 01:35:45.470
<v Speaker 1>Khrushchev was sent off to live in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in exile in this Dasha.</v>

1643
01:35:45.471 --> 01:35:46.304
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember which one says his </v>
<v Speaker 1>vacation home until he died in about </v>

1644
01:35:49.491 --> 01:35:52.490
<v Speaker 1>1980 so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1645
01:35:52.491 --> 01:35:54.530
<v Speaker 1>there were a few cracks that appeared it</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly,</v>

1646
01:35:54.531 --> 01:35:55.364
<v Speaker 1>not time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course that was also at the </v>

1647
01:35:56.241 --> 01:35:57.074
<v Speaker 1>height of the Cold War because it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>1962 when Kennedy and Khrushchev faced </v>

1648
01:36:00.381 --> 01:36:02.090
<v Speaker 1>off over Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1649
01:36:02.091 --> 01:36:04.640
<v Speaker 1>that was one of the places where we got </v>
<v Speaker 1>this far away from,</v>

1650
01:36:05.210 --> 01:36:06.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>total annihilation.</v>

1651
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:10.903
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1652
01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:16.000
<v Speaker 1>How soldier Nixon's proposition was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>had people refused to lie,</v>

1653
01:36:19.370 --> 01:36:23.330
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet government could have never </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken hold or maintained itself.</v>

1654
01:36:24.930 --> 01:36:26.880
<v Speaker 1>So he believed that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1655
01:36:26.881 --> 01:36:29.610
<v Speaker 1>cause there's a lot of theories about </v>
<v Speaker 1>how a society becomes corrupt,</v>

1656
01:36:29.611 --> 01:36:30.444
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like let's say you take the example </v>

1657
01:36:32.251 --> 01:36:33.084
<v Speaker 1>of Nazi Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say it's the following orders </v>

1658
01:36:36.151 --> 01:36:37.710
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1659
01:36:38.730 --> 01:36:39.563
<v Speaker 1>The power structure is taken over by </v>
<v Speaker 1>thugs and then what you're doing when </v>

1660
01:36:43.711 --> 01:36:46.560
<v Speaker 1>you carry out the orders of the thugs is</v>

1661
01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:51.250
<v Speaker 1>merely responding out of fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a good person,</v>

1662
01:36:51.251 --> 01:36:53.500
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be put in a terrible situation and</v>

1663
01:36:53.501 --> 01:36:55.450
<v Speaker 1>there's terrible pressure being brought </v>
<v Speaker 1>to bear on you.</v>

1664
01:36:55.630 --> 01:36:57.670
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you go do the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>

1665
01:36:58.330 --> 01:36:59.163
<v Speaker 1>And so that theory is predicated on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that there's no real relationship </v>

1666
01:37:02.651 --> 01:37:03.484
<v Speaker 1>between the populous and the government </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that the government is basically </v>

1667
01:37:06.521 --> 01:37:07.354
<v Speaker 1>taken over by [inaudible] and the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who organize the coo are well </v>

1668
01:37:09.911 --> 01:37:10.744
<v Speaker 1>distributed enough and aggressive enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>to maintain authority by punishment </v>

1669
01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:16.113
<v Speaker 1>under all circumstances whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that theory is that it </v>

1670
01:37:19.961 --> 01:37:20.794
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first issue is did Hitler create </v>

1671
01:37:26.711 --> 01:37:28.750
<v Speaker 1>the Germans or did the Germans create </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler?</v>

1672
01:37:29.170 --> 01:37:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Or could you say that they were involved</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a dance?</v>

1673
01:37:32.290 --> 01:37:33.123
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must take on that because you can </v>

1674
01:37:34.111 --> 01:37:34.944
<v Speaker 1>spend a lot of times stuff what the hell</v>
<v Speaker 1>was going on in Germany and by his own </v>

1675
01:37:37.691 --> 01:37:40.630
<v Speaker 1>admission got caught up in it for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>short period of time.</v>

1676
01:37:40.631 --> 01:37:43.240
<v Speaker 1>But he said when he was there that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1677
01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:47.290
<v Speaker 1>the illness so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was so overwhelming.</v>

1678
01:37:47.291 --> 01:37:49.880
<v Speaker 1>That was virtually impossible not to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>caught up there.</v>

1679
01:37:50.170 --> 01:37:50.591
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1680
01:37:50.591 --> 01:37:51.424
<v Speaker 1>I think people underestimate the degree </v>
<v Speaker 1>to which what they think is true and </v>

1681
01:37:54.101 --> 01:37:56.070
<v Speaker 1>false is a consequence of the mill</v>

1682
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:57.300
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they'd be placed here.</v>

1683
01:37:58.200 --> 01:37:59.033
<v Speaker 5>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is partly from reading young </v>

1684
01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:01.703
<v Speaker 5>Hitler and the Germans cocreated each </v>
<v Speaker 5>other and the young Ian explanation for </v>

1685
01:38:05.431 --> 01:38:08.010
<v Speaker 5>that with something like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to update it a bit,</v>

1686
01:38:08.011 --> 01:38:12.840
<v Speaker 5>modernize it in a crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have dispersal of responsibility.</v>

1687
01:38:13.180 --> 01:38:14.013
<v Speaker 5>Everyone knows about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that means you can do whatever you </v>

1688
01:38:16.351 --> 01:38:18.420
<v Speaker 5>want in a crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can say whatever you want,</v>

1689
01:38:18.421 --> 01:38:21.510
<v Speaker 5>you can act however you want because </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to be held individually</v>

1690
01:38:21.511 --> 01:38:22.344
<v Speaker 5>responsible for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So young would say the crowd has the </v>

1691
01:38:24.511 --> 01:38:27.570
<v Speaker 5>capacity of allowing the shadow to </v>
<v Speaker 5>emerge.</v>

1692
01:38:27.930 --> 01:38:31.710
<v Speaker 5>And then he believed that what happened </v>
<v Speaker 5>was the crowd shadow had a dialogue,</v>

1693
01:38:32.010 --> 01:38:35.160
<v Speaker 5>often nonverbal with Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with Hitler's imagination.</v>

1694
01:38:35.610 --> 01:38:38.550
<v Speaker 5>And so Hitler who was a great retro </v>
<v Speaker 5>Titian,</v>

1695
01:38:39.810 --> 01:38:42.010
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if that's a word,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1696
01:38:42.730 --> 01:38:47.730
<v Speaker 5>what talk and his emotional oratory to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the crowd and the crowd would respond in</v>

1697
01:38:48.091 --> 01:38:48.840
<v Speaker 5>one way or another.</v>

1698
01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:49.673
<v Speaker 5>And so Hitler would be guided by their </v>
<v Speaker 5>response and being an imaginative </v>

1699
01:38:52.681 --> 01:38:53.514
<v Speaker 5>person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cobbling together what the crowd is </v>

1700
01:38:56.851 --> 01:39:00.570
<v Speaker 5>encouraging and him to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That produces a kind of a theory.</v>

1701
01:39:00.870 --> 01:39:03.720
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hitler is able to flesh out that theory.</v>

1702
01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:06.000
<v Speaker 5>Populous leaders do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1703
01:39:06.001 --> 01:39:06.834
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I talked to Preston manning at one </v>

1704
01:39:10.141 --> 01:39:12.390
<v Speaker 5>point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Preston manning started the reform party</v>

1705
01:39:12.391 --> 01:39:13.850
<v Speaker 5>in Alberta.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1706
01:39:14.210 --> 01:39:15.043
<v Speaker 5>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it eventually merged with the </v>

1707
01:39:17.071 --> 01:39:17.904
<v Speaker 5>conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was kind of an offshoot of the </v>

1708
01:39:19.860 --> 01:39:20.693
<v Speaker 5>Conservative Party.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's always been left and right wing </v>

1709
01:39:22.171 --> 01:39:24.420
<v Speaker 5>off shoot parties that are generated in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Canada,</v>

1710
01:39:24.450 --> 01:39:29.100
<v Speaker 5>almost always sit in the west.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I invited them to talk to a group of</v>

1711
01:39:29.101 --> 01:39:29.934
<v Speaker 5>people that I brought together to tell </v>
<v Speaker 5>us how he managed to create a whole </v>

1712
01:39:33.181 --> 01:39:34.014
<v Speaker 5>political party in like 10 years now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was the son of a premium who is the </v>

1713
01:39:38.041 --> 01:39:38.874
<v Speaker 5>right way and premium.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we had this connections and that was </v>

1714
01:39:42.001 --> 01:39:43.440
<v Speaker 5>part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he said,</v>

1715
01:39:43.441 --> 01:39:44.280
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he'd go to,</v>

1716
01:39:44.610 --> 01:39:48.520
<v Speaker 5>there was a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 5>western separatist</v>

1717
01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:53.280
<v Speaker 5>agitation at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And and people in Alberta,</v>

1718
01:39:54.210 --> 01:39:54.660
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1719
01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:55.493
<v Speaker 5>some of the political leaders thought </v>
<v Speaker 5>that that would become powerful enough </v>

1720
01:39:57.271 --> 01:40:00.240
<v Speaker 5>so that it would actually be a movement </v>
<v Speaker 5>to contend with.</v>

1721
01:40:00.241 --> 01:40:01.074
<v Speaker 5>And partly what they were doing with the</v>
<v Speaker 5>formation of the reform party was to </v>

1722
01:40:03.271 --> 01:40:05.490
<v Speaker 5>take some of the pressure off that side </v>
<v Speaker 5>of things.</v>

1723
01:40:05.910 --> 01:40:06.743
<v Speaker 5>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they started to go around to talk to </v>

1724
01:40:09.091 --> 01:40:12.510
<v Speaker 5>people in arenas mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and manny would give a speech,</v>

1725
01:40:12.511 --> 01:40:15.870
<v Speaker 5>but he said the thing that he liked best</v>
<v Speaker 5>was the question and answer at the end.</v>

1726
01:40:16.140 --> 01:40:16.973
<v Speaker 5>And then what the Reform Party did was </v>
<v Speaker 5>derived its policies from the question </v>

1727
01:40:20.911 --> 01:40:23.430
<v Speaker 5>and answer sessions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you could imagine that,</v>

1728
01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:24.293
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the crowd had concerns which were </v>

1729
01:40:25.741 --> 01:40:28.290
<v Speaker 5>allowed to be expressed in an </v>
<v Speaker 5>articulated fashion.</v>

1730
01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:29.573
<v Speaker 5>And the party built a lot of its </v>
<v Speaker 5>doctrines as a consequence of that </v>

1731
01:40:32.610 --> 01:40:33.443
<v Speaker 5>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And of course that was partly what </v>

1732
01:40:34.771 --> 01:40:35.604
<v Speaker 5>accounted for it's rapid popularity </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it was actually addressing the </v>

1733
01:40:38.311 --> 01:40:40.680
<v Speaker 5>desires of the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

1734
01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:41.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could even say,</v>

1735
01:40:41.911 --> 01:40:43.680
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's how a democracy should function,</v>

1736
01:40:44.220 --> 01:40:45.330
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

1737
01:40:47.550 --> 01:40:48.383
<v Speaker 5>but that also assumes that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>democratic systems and conventions are </v>

1738
01:40:53.381 --> 01:40:55.420
<v Speaker 5>in place to protect against,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1739
01:40:55.421 --> 01:40:56.254
<v Speaker 5>let's say just a mass movement that goes</v>
<v Speaker 5>off radically to the laughter radically </v>

1740
01:40:59.891 --> 01:41:00.724
<v Speaker 5>to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was still all taking place within a </v>

1741
01:41:02.201 --> 01:41:05.530
<v Speaker 5>perfectly functional monarchical </v>
<v Speaker 5>democracy,</v>

1742
01:41:06.130 --> 01:41:10.070
<v Speaker 5>but by his own admission and we'll,</v>

1743
01:41:11.690 --> 01:41:13.790
<v Speaker 5>the policies were shaped by the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1744
01:41:13.791 --> 01:41:14.624
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same thing happened with Hitler </v>

1745
01:41:15.201 --> 01:41:18.080
<v Speaker 5>except it happened in an underground and</v>
<v Speaker 5>pathological way.</v>

1746
01:41:18.081 --> 01:41:18.914
<v Speaker 5>And the people he was addressing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're in a hell of a lot worse shape </v>

1747
01:41:21.511 --> 01:41:23.690
<v Speaker 5>than Albertans in 1980.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1748
01:41:23.691 --> 01:41:26.210
<v Speaker 5>because they just got back from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>trenches,</v>

1749
01:41:26.660 --> 01:41:27.201
<v Speaker 5>all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1750
01:41:27.201 --> 01:41:31.280
<v Speaker 5>a huge chunk of the young men were dead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The rest that weren't,</v>

1751
01:41:31.281 --> 01:41:34.550
<v Speaker 5>were brutalized beyond belief.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The economy was in shambles.</v>

1752
01:41:34.551 --> 01:41:37.430
<v Speaker 5>The friendship imposed an incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 5>punitive,</v>

1753
01:41:37.790 --> 01:41:38.623
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1754
01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:39.120
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1755
01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:40.440
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>peace treaty,</v>

1756
01:41:41.450 --> 01:41:44.720
<v Speaker 5>Germany and lost most of its industrial,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1757
01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:48.660
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>centers as part of the redistribution of</v>

1758
01:41:48.661 --> 01:41:49.494
<v Speaker 5>land after World War One.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the whole bloody economy </v>

1759
01:41:51.661 --> 01:41:52.494
<v Speaker 5>collapsed because the German government </v>
<v Speaker 5>inflated the currency to wipe out their </v>

1760
01:41:55.051 --> 01:41:55.884
<v Speaker 5>debt to the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the allies and just reduced its </v>

1761
01:41:57.601 --> 01:41:59.970
<v Speaker 5>failure to zero.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So people were not happy,</v>

1762
01:42:00.030 --> 01:42:00.863
<v Speaker 5>they were seriously not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so that was the crowd that Hitler </v>

1763
01:42:03.241 --> 01:42:04.074
<v Speaker 5>was addressing.</v>

1764
01:42:04.730 --> 01:42:05.563
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1765
01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:14.380
<v Speaker 5>now one of the issues might be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1766
01:42:14.381 --> 01:42:15.214
<v Speaker 5>where does the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is where things get so tricky when </v>

1767
01:42:19.711 --> 01:42:22.260
<v Speaker 5>you're trying to figure out exactly how </v>
<v Speaker 5>these things are caused.</v>

1768
01:42:22.830 --> 01:42:26.580
<v Speaker 5>My sense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I took a political science degree before</v>

1769
01:42:26.581 --> 01:42:29.790
<v Speaker 5>I became a psychologist because I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>interested in this sort of thing.</v>

1770
01:42:29.791 --> 01:42:32.820
<v Speaker 5>But I became aware quite early that</v>

1771
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:37.220
<v Speaker 5>almost all the explanations that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>political scientists were offering where</v>

1772
01:42:37.221 --> 01:42:38.054
<v Speaker 5>economic and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to me that means they were all derived </v>

1773
01:42:40.161 --> 01:42:40.994
<v Speaker 5>from theories on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 5>roughly speaking because it's the left </v>

1774
01:42:42.921 --> 01:42:47.060
<v Speaker 5>that constantly claims that the primary </v>
<v Speaker 5>motivations for people are economic.</v>

1775
01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:49.610
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the right does this,</v>

1776
01:42:49.850 --> 01:42:51.670
<v Speaker 5>I won't talk about that for the moment </v>
<v Speaker 5>cause it's,</v>

1777
01:42:51.750 --> 01:42:54.410
<v Speaker 5>it's just not relevant in the context of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the university.</v>

1778
01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:55.633
<v Speaker 5>And I thought that's just not right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's all sorts of motivations that </v>

1779
01:42:57.561 --> 01:42:59.630
<v Speaker 5>people have that are economic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>

1780
01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:02.060
<v Speaker 5>there's lots of things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't take into account.</v>

1781
01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:03.113
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't take into account,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well it doesn't take into account the </v>

1782
01:43:05.811 --> 01:43:06.644
<v Speaker 5>fact that people will have a psyche and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that psyche is perfectly capable of </v>

1783
01:43:09.951 --> 01:43:12.980
<v Speaker 5>desiring good things as well as terrible</v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

1784
01:43:12.981 --> 01:43:13.820
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well what,</v>

1785
01:43:13.970 --> 01:43:16.760
<v Speaker 5>how are you going to account for that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1786
01:43:16.761 --> 01:43:19.610
<v Speaker 5>economics make someone into a suicide </v>
<v Speaker 5>bomber.</v>

1787
01:43:19.820 --> 01:43:23.360
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like economics plays a role obviously,</v>

1788
01:43:23.361 --> 01:43:26.180
<v Speaker 5>but there's lots of people who are under</v>
<v Speaker 5>severe economic pressure.</v>

1789
01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:27.740
<v Speaker 5>Do you not become,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1790
01:43:27.770 --> 01:43:30.620
<v Speaker 5>mass shooters in the United States are </v>
<v Speaker 5>suicide bombers.</v>

1791
01:43:30.860 --> 01:43:33.260
<v Speaker 5>You need a hell of a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 5>explanation than that.</v>

1792
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:38.200
<v Speaker 5>And so I was very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very interested in the uh,</v>

1793
01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:40.113
<v Speaker 5>in the moral questions that underlying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially things like what happened in </v>

1794
01:43:42.701 --> 01:43:43.534
<v Speaker 5>Nazi Germany in the concentration camps </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it seemed to me that the moral </v>

1795
01:43:46.271 --> 01:43:47.104
<v Speaker 5>question was paramount.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How could people do the sorts of things </v>

1796
01:43:50.561 --> 01:43:52.550
<v Speaker 5>that they did in the concentration </v>
<v Speaker 5>camps?</v>

1797
01:43:53.180 --> 01:43:55.700
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a psychological issue there.</v>

1798
01:43:56.630 --> 01:43:57.130
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1799
01:43:57.130 --> 01:44:00.130
<v Speaker 5>So that's when I started to read young </v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1800
01:44:00.210 --> 01:44:02.320
<v Speaker 5>and Social Netsim in particular in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Orwell.</v>

1801
01:44:02.321 --> 01:44:06.610
<v Speaker 5>And a lot of the people that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking to you about in this book,</v>

1802
01:44:06.611 --> 01:44:09.090
<v Speaker 5>I started last night,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the block book of Communism</v>

1803
01:44:11.410 --> 01:44:12.243
<v Speaker 5>in the introduction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they talked about different </v>

1804
01:44:13.301 --> 01:44:15.280
<v Speaker 5>approaches to history,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1805
01:44:15.281 --> 01:44:16.114
<v Speaker 5>and</v>

1806
01:44:17.470 --> 01:44:18.303
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is a positivist approach to </v>

1807
01:44:20.281 --> 01:44:24.150
<v Speaker 5>history where there's never any moral </v>
<v Speaker 5>judgment rendered,</v>

1808
01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:25.793
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that was the position putatively </v>

1809
01:44:28.771 --> 01:44:32.610
<v Speaker 5>taken too many people who conducted an </v>
<v Speaker 5>analysis of the 20th century.</v>

1810
01:44:33.090 --> 01:44:33.923
<v Speaker 5>But my sense is is that there's some </v>
<v Speaker 5>things that have happened that are so </v>

1811
01:44:36.331 --> 01:44:37.164
<v Speaker 5>brutal and terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but to treat that from a positivist </v>

1812
01:44:40.141 --> 01:44:43.380
<v Speaker 5>perspective is in itself a form of </v>
<v Speaker 5>complicity.</v>

1813
01:44:43.650 --> 01:44:44.483
<v Speaker 5>It's like because at some point you have</v>
<v Speaker 5>to make a decision was what happened in </v>

1814
01:44:47.791 --> 01:44:49.200
<v Speaker 5>Auschwitz,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wrong or not?</v>

1815
01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:53.300
<v Speaker 5>It's a simple question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can say it wasn't,</v>

1816
01:44:53.370 --> 01:44:54.203
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't wrong because the standards of</v>
<v Speaker 5>right and wrong are generated locally </v>

1817
01:44:57.660 --> 01:45:02.340
<v Speaker 5>and there's no ultimate standard against</v>
<v Speaker 5>which they can be judged.</v>

1818
01:45:02.700 --> 01:45:05.250
<v Speaker 5>And so there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are constructions,</v>

1819
01:45:05.251 --> 01:45:07.560
<v Speaker 5>they're local constructions of </v>
<v Speaker 5>convenience.</v>

1820
01:45:07.770 --> 01:45:10.980
<v Speaker 5>And even if you're not happy with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>results they produce,</v>

1821
01:45:11.130 --> 01:45:13.260
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't mean you get to say they </v>
<v Speaker 5>were wrong.</v>

1822
01:45:14.250 --> 01:45:15.083
<v Speaker 5>Or you can say to hell with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't care what your rationalization </v>

1823
01:45:19.081 --> 01:45:22.500
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you perform this kind of action,</v>

1824
01:45:22.710 --> 01:45:26.130
<v Speaker 5>then what you're doing is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I should also say that</v>

1825
01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:30.780
<v Speaker 5>that was actually formerly determined </v>
<v Speaker 5>after World War II,</v>

1826
01:45:30.810 --> 01:45:32.820
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because after World War II,</v>

1827
01:45:32.821 --> 01:45:35.790
<v Speaker 5>the Nazi leaders were subjected to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Nuremberg trials.</v>

1828
01:45:36.690 --> 01:45:39.480
<v Speaker 5>And that's where the idea of crimes </v>
<v Speaker 5>against humanity emerged.</v>

1829
01:45:39.810 --> 01:45:43.560
<v Speaker 5>War Crimes and crimes against humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the basic principle,</v>

1830
01:45:44.070 --> 01:45:44.903
<v Speaker 5>there's a few of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the basic principle between the eye </v>

1831
01:45:46.950 --> 01:45:47.783
<v Speaker 5>behind the idea that there can be crimes</v>
<v Speaker 5>against humanity is that it's wrong to </v>

1832
01:45:52.201 --> 01:45:55.830
<v Speaker 5>kill someone for the manner in which </v>
<v Speaker 5>they were born.</v>

1833
01:45:57.200 --> 01:45:58.033
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1834
01:45:58.100 --> 01:46:01.790
<v Speaker 5>So that's the basic principle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that could be race obviously.</v>

1835
01:46:02.260 --> 01:46:03.740
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it could be language,</v>

1836
01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:06.260
<v Speaker 5>it could be gender,</v>
<v Speaker 5>could be class,</v>

1837
01:46:06.350 --> 01:46:07.730
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's wrong.</v>

1838
01:46:08.150 --> 01:46:09.230
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

1839
01:46:09.890 --> 01:46:13.100
<v Speaker 5>A cynic would say has to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1840
01:46:13.101 --> 01:46:15.740
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Had the Germans won the war,</v>

1841
01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:16.663
<v Speaker 5>the laws would have been different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that was just the law written by the </v>

1842
01:46:18.951 --> 01:46:21.860
<v Speaker 5>victors and the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the cynic would also say,</v>

1843
01:46:22.190 --> 01:46:24.080
<v Speaker 5>well Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know exactly what you say.</v>

1844
01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:25.273
<v Speaker 5>I guess the next thing you say is you </v>
<v Speaker 5>cannot appeal to universal principles </v>

1845
01:46:28.251 --> 01:46:32.690
<v Speaker 5>that transcend culture because people </v>
<v Speaker 5>are cultural creatures only,</v>

1846
01:46:33.260 --> 01:46:34.093
<v Speaker 5>which is by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>also the claim of the radical left </v>

1847
01:46:36.710 --> 01:46:40.280
<v Speaker 5>because one of the things that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>radical left wanted to do in places like</v>

1848
01:46:40.281 --> 01:46:45.050
<v Speaker 5>the Soviet Union and China and Cambodia </v>
<v Speaker 5>and so forth was to produce the new man.</v>

1849
01:46:45.590 --> 01:46:49.990
<v Speaker 5>And the idea was wipe out the past,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really wipe it out in the model.</v>

1850
01:46:49.990 --> 01:46:53.460
<v Speaker 5>We went a long way to doing that because</v>
<v Speaker 5>part of the cultural revolution involved</v>

1851
01:46:53.610 --> 01:46:54.443
<v Speaker 5>the wholesale destruction of almost all </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the China's history prior to 1960 so </v>

1852
01:46:59.401 --> 01:47:01.050
<v Speaker 5>that's another thing that we can thank </v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1853
01:47:01.350 --> 01:47:04.650
<v Speaker 5>the radical communist sport is they </v>
<v Speaker 5>destroyed Chinese culture,</v>

1854
01:47:04.890 --> 01:47:08.040
<v Speaker 5>all that history</v>
<v Speaker 5>done.</v>

1855
01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:09.293
<v Speaker 5>And part of the reason for that was that</v>
<v Speaker 5>they idiot logically presumed that that </v>

1856
01:47:12.571 --> 01:47:16.710
<v Speaker 5>culture was transforming people into the</v>
<v Speaker 5>wrong sort of person.</v>

1857
01:47:16.890 --> 01:47:18.720
<v Speaker 5>And so we're going to wipe the slate </v>
<v Speaker 5>clean,</v>

1858
01:47:18.721 --> 01:47:19.554
<v Speaker 5>which smile was perfectly willing to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>and generate the new human being out of </v>

1859
01:47:22.891 --> 01:47:23.724
<v Speaker 5>the ashes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And underneath that is the </v>

1860
01:47:24.721 --> 01:47:27.510
<v Speaker 5>presupposition that there's no such </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing as human nature.</v>

1861
01:47:27.630 --> 01:47:28.463
<v Speaker 5>It's all cultural.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the logical conclusion from Matt or </v>

1862
01:47:31.021 --> 01:47:33.030
<v Speaker 5>Al logical conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he has a,</v>

1863
01:47:33.031 --> 01:47:33.864
<v Speaker 5>people are completely malleable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's the radical social </v>

1864
01:47:36.331 --> 01:47:37.164
<v Speaker 5>constructionist position,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I would say is also the position </v>

1865
01:47:39.631 --> 01:47:41.520
<v Speaker 5>of most academics at universities.</v>

1866
01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:44.820
<v Speaker 5>Now you know that things like gender are</v>
<v Speaker 5>socially constructed.</v>

1867
01:47:44.821 --> 01:47:45.840
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1868
01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:47.033
<v Speaker 5>it's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1869
01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:49.710
<v Speaker 5>Take your goddamn argument to its </v>
<v Speaker 5>logical conclusion.</v>

1870
01:47:50.010 --> 01:47:51.840
<v Speaker 5>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't do that.</v>

1871
01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:53.970
<v Speaker 5>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause you don't know anything about,</v>

1872
01:47:53.971 --> 01:47:54.804
<v Speaker 5>I don't know anything about history.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm completely ignorant of anything </v>

1873
01:47:57.181 --> 01:48:00.240
<v Speaker 5>outside of my little narrow domain of </v>
<v Speaker 5>specialization.</v>

1874
01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:02.790
<v Speaker 5>And who cares about the hundred million </v>
<v Speaker 5>dead people.</v>

1875
01:48:03.570 --> 01:48:04.403
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't adopt a philosophical or an </v>

1876
01:48:07.321 --> 01:48:08.154
<v Speaker 5>ideological position without being </v>
<v Speaker 5>willing to see what it's done to think </v>

1877
01:48:11.131 --> 01:48:13.320
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to think through the consequences.</v>

1878
01:48:13.321 --> 01:48:14.250
<v Speaker 5>And so you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1879
01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:17.130
<v Speaker 5>people are completely malleable from a </v>
<v Speaker 5>cultural perspective.</v>

1880
01:48:17.250 --> 01:48:18.083
<v Speaker 5>What that means is that I can decide if </v>
<v Speaker 5>I have the power to make you into </v>

1881
01:48:21.331 --> 01:48:24.480
<v Speaker 5>anything I want because it's just </v>
<v Speaker 5>arbitrary after all.</v>

1882
01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:28.740
<v Speaker 5>Or you can take a different position.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the position is fundamentally,</v>

1883
01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:29.753
<v Speaker 5>I would say this is the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 5>position of Western democracy is that </v>

1884
01:48:33.031 --> 01:48:38.031
<v Speaker 5>human beings have in Nalia inalienable </v>
<v Speaker 5>rights and an inalienable character.</v>

1885
01:48:39.870 --> 01:48:42.990
<v Speaker 5>And as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's predicated on the,</v>

1886
01:48:43.290 --> 01:48:48.290
<v Speaker 5>roughly speaking on the idea of horace,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's that idea is that the person is the</v>

1887
01:48:48.631 --> 01:48:53.460
<v Speaker 5>center of the kind of consciousness that</v>
<v Speaker 5>creates the world as it acts.</v>

1888
01:48:53.820 --> 01:48:54.653
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because one of the things I was curious </v>

1889
01:48:55.621 --> 01:48:58.410
<v Speaker 5>about when I was working on these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>

1890
01:48:58.411 --> 01:48:59.244
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1891
01:49:00.030 --> 01:49:03.300
<v Speaker 5>the communists have one world view and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Western democracies have another,</v>

1892
01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:07.530
<v Speaker 5>and you could say it's just a battle </v>
<v Speaker 5>between ideologies.</v>

1893
01:49:07.650 --> 01:49:08.483
<v Speaker 5>And you would also say under those </v>
<v Speaker 5>circumstances that all belief systems </v>

1894
01:49:10.741 --> 01:49:11.574
<v Speaker 5>are nothing but an ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's the radical social </v>

1895
01:49:13.801 --> 01:49:15.780
<v Speaker 5>constructionist viewpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1896
01:49:16.050 --> 01:49:17.620
<v Speaker 5>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1897
01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:20.790
<v Speaker 5>it's behavior isn't in some sense taken </v>
<v Speaker 5>to its extreme right?</v>

1898
01:49:21.030 --> 01:49:22.830
<v Speaker 5>Human beings are a blank slate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1899
01:49:22.831 --> 01:49:23.970
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not.</v>

1900
01:49:24.150 --> 01:49:24.983
<v Speaker 5>We know that there's enough biology </v>
<v Speaker 5>being we've studied enough biology over </v>

1901
01:49:28.981 --> 01:49:31.860
<v Speaker 5>the last hundred years so that we can </v>
<v Speaker 5>just dispense with that idea.</v>

1902
01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:34.020
<v Speaker 5>It's raw.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But anyways,</v>

1903
01:49:34.950 --> 01:49:36.870
<v Speaker 5>we'll give the devil his due.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1904
01:49:36.871 --> 01:49:41.130
<v Speaker 5>It's an ideological conflict between </v>
<v Speaker 5>communism and and the West.</v>

1905
01:49:41.250 --> 01:49:42.990
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's arbitrary.</v>

1906
01:49:43.110 --> 01:49:45.150
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter who wins,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the war is,</v>

1907
01:49:45.180 --> 01:49:47.010
<v Speaker 5>the war is between these two belief </v>
<v Speaker 5>systems.</v>

1908
01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:49.000
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why is that a flawed argument?</v>

1909
01:49:49.780 --> 01:49:50.613
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people weren't flocking into Soviet </v>

1910
01:49:51.970 --> 01:49:54.700
<v Speaker 5>Union as immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were trying desperately to escape,</v>

1911
01:49:54.730 --> 01:49:57.910
<v Speaker 5>which is why there was a wall in Germany</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if you go went over the wall,</v>

1912
01:49:57.940 --> 01:49:59.200
<v Speaker 5>they shot you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1913
01:49:59.201 --> 01:50:02.380
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't look so good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well then there's all the deaths,</v>

1914
01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:05.020
<v Speaker 5>35 million of them that seems to </v>
<v Speaker 5>indicate that,</v>

1915
01:50:05.060 --> 01:50:05.893
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a bit more happening on the </v>

1916
01:50:07.721 --> 01:50:10.210
<v Speaker 5>pathological end in one society.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then on the other.</v>

1917
01:50:10.510 --> 01:50:12.340
<v Speaker 5>And then the next thing I was curious </v>
<v Speaker 5>about is,</v>

1918
01:50:12.341 --> 01:50:13.174
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where the hell did the idea that needle </v>

1919
01:50:14.061 --> 01:50:17.890
<v Speaker 5>animal rights come from?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like is that just something arbitrary?</v>

1920
01:50:18.210 --> 01:50:22.630
<v Speaker 5>Is it just an invention or is it based </v>
<v Speaker 5>on something that's real and you know,</v>

1921
01:50:22.631 --> 01:50:23.600
<v Speaker 5>what is real meat?</v>

1922
01:50:23.740 --> 01:50:27.760
<v Speaker 5>And so that's when I started to trace </v>
<v Speaker 5>the emergence of the idea back as far as</v>

1923
01:50:27.761 --> 01:50:29.650
<v Speaker 5>I could trace it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so first of all,</v>

1924
01:50:29.651 --> 01:50:30.484
<v Speaker 5>that was political.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So maybe that manifested itself in the </v>

1925
01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:35.260
<v Speaker 5>most articulate it for him during the </v>
<v Speaker 5>enlightenment.</v>

1926
01:50:35.770 --> 01:50:39.340
<v Speaker 5>But that isn't where it started because </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the 13th century,</v>

1927
01:50:39.341 --> 01:50:41.470
<v Speaker 5>the English should come up with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>magnet card already.</v>

1928
01:50:41.471 --> 01:50:43.240
<v Speaker 5>And so there was an idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1929
01:50:43.450 --> 01:50:47.890
<v Speaker 5>the people had some sovereignty that the</v>
<v Speaker 5>monarchy was not allowed to steal.</v>

1930
01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:50.830
<v Speaker 5>And that was the origin of the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 5>parliamentary democracy.</v>

1931
01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:51.993
<v Speaker 5>But that emerged out of another idea and</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was the Judeo Christian idea that </v>

1932
01:50:55.870 --> 01:50:58.690
<v Speaker 5>everyone had value before God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>

1933
01:50:58.691 --> 01:51:00.220
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well what the hell does that mean?</v>

1934
01:51:00.221 --> 01:51:01.360
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you might say,</v>

1935
01:51:01.361 --> 01:51:02.194
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if that's the case and we've dispensed </v>

1936
01:51:03.911 --> 01:51:04.744
<v Speaker 5>with the idea of God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then the whole idea of natural rights </v>

1937
01:51:06.641 --> 01:51:09.490
<v Speaker 5>falls,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which by the way was niches prediction.</v>

1938
01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:10.473
<v Speaker 5>He thought as soon as we wiped out the </v>
<v Speaker 5>classical underlying structure that the </v>

1939
01:51:14.231 --> 01:51:16.420
<v Speaker 5>whole idea of rights would just </v>
<v Speaker 5>disintegrate.</v>

1940
01:51:16.690 --> 01:51:17.523
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's exactly what happened in the </v>

1941
01:51:19.300 --> 01:51:20.880
<v Speaker 5>Soviet Union and China and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1942
01:51:20.980 --> 01:51:24.760
<v Speaker 5>and we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might not happen here,</v>

1943
01:51:24.790 --> 01:51:27.370
<v Speaker 5>but it wouldn't surprise me if it did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1944
01:51:27.371 --> 01:51:28.300
<v Speaker 5>So then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1945
01:51:28.301 --> 01:51:29.134
<v Speaker 5>is there anything that might lead,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lend some validity in any way to that </v>

1946
01:51:32.981 --> 01:51:33.970
<v Speaker 5>claim?</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

1947
01:51:33.971 --> 01:51:38.170
<v Speaker 5>what is the claim mean that people have </v>
<v Speaker 5>value before God also?</v>

1948
01:51:38.171 --> 01:51:40.000
<v Speaker 5>So I went back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the,</v>

1949
01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:41.680
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the theological stories.</v>

1950
01:51:41.681 --> 01:51:42.514
<v Speaker 5>And the religious history and tried to </v>
<v Speaker 5>figure out exactly where this idea had </v>

1951
01:51:44.981 --> 01:51:47.560
<v Speaker 5>come from and what it meant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I found that you could just trace it</v>

1952
01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:50.260
<v Speaker 5>farther and farther and farther and </v>
<v Speaker 5>farther back.</v>

1953
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:52.900
<v Speaker 5>So you know with disappears that </v>
<v Speaker 5>Mesopotamia,</v>

1954
01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:54.513
<v Speaker 5>but then it doesn't disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because if you look at wolf packs and </v>

1955
01:51:57.521 --> 01:51:59.920
<v Speaker 5>chimp troops and social animals in </v>
<v Speaker 5>general,</v>

1956
01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:01.113
<v Speaker 5>they organize their societies as if each</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the individuals in the hierarchy you </v>

1957
01:52:04.451 --> 01:52:05.284
<v Speaker 5>have value and the wolves for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if there's a dominance dispute </v>

1958
01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:10.060
<v Speaker 5>between two wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one wins,</v>

1959
01:52:10.270 --> 01:52:14.080
<v Speaker 5>one turns its neck over and says you </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't tear up my throat.</v>

1960
01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:17.230
<v Speaker 5>And the other wolf says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now you're annoying,</v>

1961
01:52:17.231 --> 01:52:18.940
<v Speaker 5>but we'll keep you around because you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>useful.</v>

1962
01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:20.200
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's this,</v>

1963
01:52:20.201 --> 01:52:21.034
<v Speaker 5>it's the same idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The idea is that the individual has </v>

1964
01:52:23.351 --> 01:52:27.490
<v Speaker 5>integrity worth in relationship to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>group and then that's not an ideological</v>

1965
01:52:27.491 --> 01:52:28.324
<v Speaker 5>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's an idea that's based as far as I </v>

1966
01:52:30.671 --> 01:52:33.100
<v Speaker 5>can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an evolution and it's really,</v>

1967
01:52:33.101 --> 01:52:35.680
<v Speaker 5>really deep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It goes back as far as you can chase it.</v>

1968
01:52:35.890 --> 01:52:38.410
<v Speaker 5>So that means it's not just an </v>
<v Speaker 5>ideological conflict.</v>

1969
01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:39.633
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1970
01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:40.713
<v Speaker 5>maybe that's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I can't see anywhere that it's </v>

1971
01:52:42.941 --> 01:52:46.160
<v Speaker 5>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you always using</v>

1972
01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:49.100
<v Speaker 4>our</v>
<v Speaker 4>missionary?</v>

1973
01:53:03.740 --> 01:53:04.281
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1974
01:53:04.281 --> 01:53:05.810
<v Speaker 1>so that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1975
01:53:05.811 --> 01:53:08.120
<v Speaker 1>so the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1976
01:53:08.121 --> 01:53:12.230
<v Speaker 1>I parceled off one set of beliefs as </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically grounded in evolutionary,</v>

1977
01:53:12.770 --> 01:53:13.970
<v Speaker 1>in evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1978
01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make two distinctions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

1979
01:53:16.731 --> 01:53:21.050
<v Speaker 1>there's a difference between an idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's grounded in that evolution and an</v>

1980
01:53:21.051 --> 01:53:23.750
<v Speaker 1>idea that's grounded in evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>

1981
01:53:24.530 --> 01:53:26.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Marxists we're,</v>

1982
01:53:26.370 --> 01:53:27.203
<v Speaker 1>we're grounded and evolutionary theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have psychobiological </v>

1983
01:53:30.230 --> 01:53:33.200
<v Speaker 1>justifications for their claims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

1984
01:53:33.201 --> 01:53:35.660
<v Speaker 1>I know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to dispense with that first.</v>

1985
01:53:36.050 --> 01:53:37.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I was thinking,</v>

1986
01:53:38.390 --> 01:53:41.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly do ideologies do?</v>

1987
01:53:41.690 --> 01:53:42.523
<v Speaker 1>Because obviously they're also not </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructive just arbitrarily because </v>

1988
01:53:46.101 --> 01:53:48.080
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't be attractive to people if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they work.</v>

1989
01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:50.450
<v Speaker 1>They have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

1990
01:53:50.451 --> 01:53:51.284
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you look for example at Mao or </v>

1991
01:53:54.171 --> 01:53:57.020
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marks Stalin and Lenin,</v>

1992
01:53:57.050 --> 01:53:59.960
<v Speaker 1>so you could think of them as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trinity of the USSR.</v>

1993
01:54:00.290 --> 01:54:01.123
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think part of the reason that the </v>

1994
01:54:01.671 --> 01:54:04.280
<v Speaker 1>trinitarian idea worked as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

1995
01:54:04.460 --> 01:54:05.293
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a means of propaganda was because </v>

1996
01:54:07.100 --> 01:54:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Russia was an orthodox Christian country</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it had the trinitarian idea already,</v>

1997
01:54:11.610 --> 01:54:14.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lay down and it's unconscious.</v>

1998
01:54:15.260 --> 01:54:20.150
<v Speaker 1>Well you remember I showed you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagram of chaos on the outside and then</v>

1999
01:54:20.151 --> 01:54:20.984
<v Speaker 1>the great mother and then the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>father and then the individual and the </v>

2000
01:54:23.211 --> 01:54:26.780
<v Speaker 1>valence of each of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what happens with an ideology,</v>

2001
01:54:26.781 --> 01:54:27.614
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't point this out that out at the </v>

2002
01:54:28.581 --> 01:54:29.414
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's worth revisiting is that the </v>

2003
01:54:31.081 --> 01:54:35.120
<v Speaker 1>ideology capitalizes on certain aspects </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that story.</v>

2004
01:54:35.570 --> 01:54:38.270
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't tell the whole truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it stands,</v>

2005
01:54:38.271 --> 01:54:41.510
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual is all good,</v>

2006
01:54:42.410 --> 01:54:45.260
<v Speaker 1>the state is corrupt and mother nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>is good.</v>

2007
01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:46.393
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Russo and that's the </v>

2008
01:54:47.991 --> 01:54:49.850
<v Speaker 1>environmentalist movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2009
01:54:49.851 --> 01:54:50.570
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's grounded.</v>

2010
01:54:50.570 --> 01:54:53.180
<v Speaker 1>We were so in thinking via thoroughal </v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2011
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:58.510
<v Speaker 1>and then you have the officer at which </v>
<v Speaker 1>is harms and Hob says the individual is,</v>

2012
01:54:58.910 --> 01:54:59.743
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a catastrophe of conflicts and </v>

2013
01:55:01.821 --> 01:55:04.130
<v Speaker 1>aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The state has to be,</v>

2014
01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:08.990
<v Speaker 1>the state is the only thing that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly keep the individual in check.</v>

2015
01:55:08.991 --> 01:55:09.824
<v Speaker 1>And that protects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it protects us from the ultimate chaos </v>

2016
01:55:11.511 --> 01:55:12.620
<v Speaker 1>of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2017
01:55:12.621 --> 01:55:16.460
<v Speaker 1>those are both true and you can derive </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologies from them.</v>

2018
01:55:16.461 --> 01:55:19.700
<v Speaker 1>But I think their weaknesses is they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't take the other side into account.</v>

2019
01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:21.193
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that you can say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the traditions that I've been </v>

2020
01:55:24.100 --> 01:55:26.540
<v Speaker 1>describing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they've been around toola.</v>

2021
01:55:26.541 --> 01:55:28.100
<v Speaker 1>So when you look at Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2022
01:55:28.460 --> 01:55:32.480
<v Speaker 1>the story has all the elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has the adversary,</v>

2023
01:55:32.481 --> 01:55:33.590
<v Speaker 1>so that seth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2024
01:55:34.100 --> 01:55:34.933
<v Speaker 1>it has the good king and not so cyrus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it has isis as queen of the </v>

2025
01:55:38.361 --> 01:55:40.760
<v Speaker 1>underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's gone to pot like she's,</v>

2026
01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:42.890
<v Speaker 1>she's not as well differentiated in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

2027
01:55:42.891 --> 01:55:44.220
<v Speaker 1>but the elements are still there.</v>

2028
01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:46.290
<v Speaker 6>And you have horace,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it says says,</v>

2029
01:55:46.291 --> 01:55:47.124
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>life is this landscape and all these </v>

2030
01:55:49.171 --> 01:55:51.540
<v Speaker 6>characters are participate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2031
01:55:51.541 --> 01:55:52.374
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's as close as we can get to a </v>

2032
01:55:54.481 --> 01:55:57.690
<v Speaker 6>narrative truth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And part of the reason I wanted to teach</v>

2033
01:55:57.691 --> 01:56:00.900
<v Speaker 6>this course once I thought I'd figured </v>
<v Speaker 6>these things out,</v>

2034
01:56:00.901 --> 01:56:03.520
<v Speaker 6>was to provide people with a defense </v>
<v Speaker 6>against ideology.</v>

2035
01:56:03.930 --> 01:56:07.050
<v Speaker 6>It's like someone tells you it's a story</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's causal.</v>

2036
01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:09.670
<v Speaker 6>Here's how history laid itself out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2037
01:56:09.671 --> 01:56:13.050
<v Speaker 6>It's plausible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like the Russo story is plausible and so</v>

2038
01:56:13.051 --> 01:56:14.350
<v Speaker 6>is the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2039
01:56:15.090 --> 01:56:16.590
<v Speaker 6>hobbsy and story.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>

2040
01:56:16.591 --> 01:56:18.510
<v Speaker 6>not only their plausible,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're true,</v>

2041
01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:21.270
<v Speaker 6>but they're only true like this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2042
01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:22.493
<v Speaker 6>and the other one's true like this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you want to know where's the other </v>

2043
01:56:25.081 --> 01:56:25.914
<v Speaker 6>half of the story?</v>
<v Speaker 6>People are inherently good in society </v>

2044
01:56:28.231 --> 01:56:29.520
<v Speaker 6>corrupts them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

2045
01:56:30.060 --> 01:56:32.670
<v Speaker 6>People are inherently evil in society.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Regulates them.</v>

2046
01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:34.170
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's,</v>

2047
01:56:34.171 --> 01:56:35.004
<v Speaker 6>it's hard on people because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the classic idea of Western logic is </v>

2048
01:56:38.611 --> 01:56:42.300
<v Speaker 6>that one thing can't be itself and its </v>
<v Speaker 6>opposite at the same time.</v>

2049
01:56:42.780 --> 01:56:43.613
<v Speaker 6>But that only applies to unitary things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And like a human being is not a unitary </v>

2050
01:56:47.641 --> 01:56:50.400
<v Speaker 6>thing and neither is a state.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

2051
01:56:51.030 --> 01:56:53.520
<v Speaker 6>so well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so that's the best answer that I have to</v>

2052
01:56:53.521 --> 01:56:57.310
<v Speaker 6>that question</v>
<v Speaker 6>is like,</v>

2053
01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:01.320
<v Speaker 6>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's exactly what it is.</v>

2054
01:57:01.350 --> 01:57:02.183
<v Speaker 6>That's why it has its power because it </v>
<v Speaker 6>can extract it's motive power from the </v>

2055
01:57:05.641 --> 01:57:08.730
<v Speaker 6>underlying archetypes which,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which relates to them to the motivations</v>

2056
01:57:08.731 --> 01:57:09.564
<v Speaker 6>that you just described.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like there is a pronounced demand for </v>

2057
01:57:12.931 --> 01:57:16.560
<v Speaker 6>egalitarianism in human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's agreeableness,</v>

2058
01:57:16.590 --> 01:57:17.970
<v Speaker 6>the trading,</v>
<v Speaker 6>agreeableness.</v>

2059
01:57:18.270 --> 01:57:20.790
<v Speaker 6>So the more agreeable you are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the more egalitarian you are.</v>

2060
01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:21.713
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because people should share and get </v>

2061
01:57:23.101 --> 01:57:26.070
<v Speaker 6>along.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's especially true within the confines</v>

2062
01:57:26.071 --> 01:57:28.020
<v Speaker 6>of a family or tribal unit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2063
01:57:28.110 --> 01:57:30.090
<v Speaker 6>Where everyone's pulling together and </v>
<v Speaker 6>cooperate.</v>

2064
01:57:30.510 --> 01:57:32.820
<v Speaker 6>It isn't obvious to me that it's useful </v>
<v Speaker 6>ethic.</v>

2065
01:57:32.821 --> 01:57:36.960
<v Speaker 6>Once you get beyond like a kin group </v>
<v Speaker 6>size,</v>

2066
01:57:37.950 --> 01:57:42.240
<v Speaker 6>I think you need conscientiousness then </v>
<v Speaker 6>because conscientiousness is more like a</v>

2067
01:57:42.241 --> 01:57:45.510
<v Speaker 6>cold virtue and it's the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 6>supports,</v>

2068
01:57:45.750 --> 01:57:48.480
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>success in bureaucracies.</v>

2069
01:57:48.630 --> 01:57:49.463
<v Speaker 6>If you're conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you go into a large landscape of </v>

2070
01:57:51.661 --> 01:57:52.494
<v Speaker 6>unrelated people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So maybe a functional bureaucracy and </v>

2071
01:57:54.811 --> 01:57:55.644
<v Speaker 6>conscientiousness predicts your success.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But conscientiousness and agreeableness </v>

2072
01:57:59.460 --> 01:58:00.293
<v Speaker 6>are orthogonal to one another.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They do not have the same value </v>

2073
01:58:02.641 --> 01:58:05.220
<v Speaker 6>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the truth of the matter is,</v>

2074
01:58:05.221 --> 01:58:09.270
<v Speaker 6>is that they both wouldn't exist if they</v>
<v Speaker 6>weren't both necessary.</v>

2075
01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:10.673
<v Speaker 6>Egalitarianism is necessary because </v>
<v Speaker 6>otherwise the hierarchy skitzo damn </v>

2076
01:58:13.981 --> 01:58:17.970
<v Speaker 6>steep that the people at the bottom die </v>
<v Speaker 6>and the whole system collapses.</v>

2077
01:58:18.630 --> 01:58:19.463
<v Speaker 6>But agreeableness is as a universal </v>
<v Speaker 6>ethic is no good because it doesn't </v>

2078
01:58:22.891 --> 01:58:23.724
<v Speaker 6>allow for distinctions of quality and it</v>
<v Speaker 6>doesn't allow any decisions to be made </v>

2079
01:58:27.181 --> 01:58:28.014
<v Speaker 6>because if a hundred people have to come</v>
<v Speaker 6>to a consensus before action can take </v>

2080
01:58:31.171 --> 01:58:32.004
<v Speaker 6>place,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well someone with a hierarchy who's </v>

2081
01:58:35.160 --> 01:58:37.740
<v Speaker 6>invading you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're just going to wipe you out.</v>

2082
01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:42.430
<v Speaker 6>You're so slow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So there's this tension and it is partly</v>

2083
01:58:42.431 --> 01:58:43.264
<v Speaker 6>the tension between,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's the tension between the far left </v>

2084
01:58:46.871 --> 01:58:47.704
<v Speaker 6>and the right because the best marker </v>
<v Speaker 6>for the far left is agreeableness in </v>

2085
01:58:51.401 --> 01:58:55.030
<v Speaker 6>terms of a personality dimension that </v>
<v Speaker 6>predicts question.</v>

2086
01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:01.630
<v Speaker 3>You can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2087
01:59:01.980 --> 01:59:02.813
<v Speaker 3>if you have a license to sell as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>element of the culture that butter the </v>

2088
01:59:08.250 --> 01:59:09.083
<v Speaker 3>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why can't you say that's also one side </v>

2089
01:59:12.220 --> 01:59:13.053
<v Speaker 3>other side?</v>

2090
01:59:13.400 --> 01:59:14.233
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think the reason that that I don't </v>

2091
01:59:15.951 --> 01:59:19.010
<v Speaker 6>think that that's appropriate is </v>
<v Speaker 6>precisely the reason that I told you the</v>

2092
01:59:19.011 --> 01:59:19.844
<v Speaker 6>Egyptian and the Mesopotamian stories in</v>
<v Speaker 6>the first reason I told you those </v>

2093
01:59:22.851 --> 01:59:23.684
<v Speaker 6>stories was to show you that those </v>
<v Speaker 6>stories exist and they can't be taken </v>

2094
01:59:27.471 --> 01:59:28.304
<v Speaker 6>lightly because those stories are the </v>
<v Speaker 6>products of tens of thousands of years </v>

2095
01:59:31.521 --> 01:59:33.800
<v Speaker 6>of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like they're not just any old story.</v>

2096
01:59:34.280 --> 01:59:36.740
<v Speaker 6>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and what the story seemed to indicate is</v>

2097
01:59:36.741 --> 01:59:37.574
<v Speaker 6>that there has to be a dynamic </v>
<v Speaker 6>relationship between the vision of the </v>

2098
01:59:41.931 --> 01:59:44.150
<v Speaker 6>individual and the integrity of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>state.</v>

2099
01:59:44.390 --> 01:59:47.240
<v Speaker 6>It isn't saying that one of those is </v>
<v Speaker 6>more important than the other at all.</v>

2100
01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:50.510
<v Speaker 6>It's saying that in order for one to </v>
<v Speaker 6>remain healthy,</v>

2101
01:59:50.660 --> 01:59:51.493
<v Speaker 6>in order for both to remain healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there has to be a constant dialectic of </v>

2102
01:59:55.010 --> 01:59:59.060
<v Speaker 6>communication.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so then you could say,</v>

2103
01:59:59.061 --> 01:59:59.894
<v Speaker 6>and people have said this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how do you know this isn't just another </v>

2104
02:00:01.441 --> 02:00:02.274
<v Speaker 6>radiology?</v>

2105
02:00:02.950 --> 02:00:03.783
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2106
02:00:05.430 --> 02:00:06.800
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I tried to,</v>

2107
02:00:06.950 --> 02:00:11.240
<v Speaker 6>I tried to explain why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It looks to me like ideologies only take</v>

2108
02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:12.233
<v Speaker 6>an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how to define that because </v>

2109
02:00:13.041 --> 02:00:13.874
<v Speaker 6>I'm trying to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Part of that was grounded in the </v>

2110
02:00:16.311 --> 02:00:17.144
<v Speaker 6>question,</v>
<v Speaker 6>was it just the ideology that drove the </v>

2111
02:00:19.731 --> 02:00:21.800
<v Speaker 6>distinction between the West and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Soviet Union?</v>

2112
02:00:22.430 --> 02:00:26.660
<v Speaker 6>For me it was hopeless if it was because</v>
<v Speaker 6>if it was just in theology,</v>

2113
02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:32.240
<v Speaker 6>there wasn't right on either side and it</v>
<v Speaker 6>was just an endless battle.</v>

2114
02:00:32.870 --> 02:00:36.020
<v Speaker 6>It was an endless battle because one of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the things I realized was,</v>

2115
02:00:36.760 --> 02:00:37.593
<v Speaker 6>and this is was the most dismal part of </v>
<v Speaker 6>going through all this material for me </v>

2116
02:00:41.331 --> 02:00:42.164
<v Speaker 6>because I thought that that it was done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I came to the conclusion at one </v>

2117
02:00:45.891 --> 02:00:48.920
<v Speaker 6>point,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean for whatever relevance it has,</v>

2118
02:00:48.921 --> 02:00:49.754
<v Speaker 6>that the problem was unsolvable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Technically people were pathologized by </v>

2119
02:00:55.071 --> 02:00:56.240
<v Speaker 6>their self consciousness.</v>

2120
02:00:56.450 --> 02:00:57.283
<v Speaker 6>Completely understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like when someone comes to me with </v>

2121
02:00:59.451 --> 02:01:01.790
<v Speaker 6>an anxiety disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I never ask why.</v>

2122
02:01:02.180 --> 02:01:05.150
<v Speaker 6>I think no kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

2123
02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:08.930
<v Speaker 6>It's the healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>anxious people that are the mystery.</v>

2124
02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:10.910
<v Speaker 6>So it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

2125
02:01:10.911 --> 02:01:12.950
<v Speaker 6>why the hell aren't you freaking out all</v>
<v Speaker 6>the time?</v>

2126
02:01:13.010 --> 02:01:15.230
<v Speaker 6>It's a really good question.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2127
02:01:15.231 --> 02:01:17.690
<v Speaker 6>it's like you're like the rat that's in </v>
<v Speaker 6>its burrow.</v>

2128
02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:19.610
<v Speaker 6>You've explored the territory and you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>calm.</v>

2129
02:01:19.670 --> 02:01:22.880
<v Speaker 6>That does not mean you're calm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It also does not mean you're safe.</v>

2130
02:01:23.510 --> 02:01:25.280
<v Speaker 6>It just means that for some weird </v>
<v Speaker 6>reason,</v>

2131
02:01:25.281 --> 02:01:27.950
<v Speaker 6>you can act like you are and you can </v>
<v Speaker 6>undo that.</v>

2132
02:01:27.951 --> 02:01:29.600
<v Speaker 6>Like people have that undone all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>

2133
02:01:29.601 --> 02:01:30.434
<v Speaker 6>They get traumatized and then they start</v>
<v Speaker 6>questioning and that whole protective </v>

2134
02:01:33.351 --> 02:01:35.840
<v Speaker 6>structure falls apart and they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>screwed.</v>

2135
02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:37.700
<v Speaker 6>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're anxious.</v>

2136
02:01:37.701 --> 02:01:39.770
<v Speaker 6>They're in pain,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they develop bag or a phobia,</v>

2137
02:01:39.950 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 6>you</v>

2138
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:43.160
<v Speaker 5>know where they develop obsessive </v>
<v Speaker 5>compulsive disorder and you think,</v>

2139
02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:47.210
<v Speaker 5>well yeah obviously it's like someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>comes to me and says,</v>

2140
02:01:47.211 --> 02:01:50.090
<v Speaker 5>well when I go into a new building I </v>
<v Speaker 5>always check out the fire exits.</v>

2141
02:01:50.900 --> 02:01:53.150
<v Speaker 5>What are you supposed to say about that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2142
02:01:54.220 --> 02:01:55.640
<v Speaker 5>well what if the building caught on </v>
<v Speaker 5>fire?</v>

2143
02:01:55.730 --> 02:01:57.710
<v Speaker 5>Well then your dad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause you don't do that.</v>

2144
02:01:58.040 --> 02:02:00.410
<v Speaker 5>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well what's the chance of that?</v>

2145
02:02:01.100 --> 02:02:02.000
<v Speaker 5>And the person says</v>

2146
02:02:03.650 --> 02:02:08.650
<v Speaker 6>1% chance of an infinitely bad outcome </v>
<v Speaker 6>is an infinitely large risk.</v>

2147
02:02:09.380 --> 02:02:12.710
<v Speaker 6>And there's no arguing with that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like how safe should you be</v>

2148
02:02:14.250 --> 02:02:16.020
<v Speaker 5>Ken?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't argue about that.</v>

2149
02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:17.333
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

2150
02:02:23.020 --> 02:02:23.853
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2151
02:02:26.290 --> 02:02:30.070
<v Speaker 6>I think the reason that I think this </v>
<v Speaker 6>isn't an ideology is because I think you</v>

2152
02:02:30.071 --> 02:02:33.730
<v Speaker 6>can make a distinction between stories </v>
<v Speaker 6>and met a stories.</v>

2153
02:02:34.810 --> 02:02:35.643
<v Speaker 6>And a story is generally an ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a partial representation of the </v>

2154
02:02:39.581 --> 02:02:42.820
<v Speaker 6>whole.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And a Meta story is an observation about</v>

2155
02:02:42.850 --> 02:02:43.683
<v Speaker 6>the set of all possible stories.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's what I was trying to do in </v>

2156
02:02:46.751 --> 02:02:48.220
<v Speaker 6>this class.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And in the book it's like,</v>

2157
02:02:48.221 --> 02:02:49.120
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's the,</v>

2158
02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:52.270
<v Speaker 6>what's the landscape of the set of all </v>
<v Speaker 6>possible stories?</v>

2159
02:02:52.540 --> 02:02:54.040
<v Speaker 6>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2160
02:02:54.041 --> 02:02:56.710
<v Speaker 6>the structure that I laid out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now maybe that's wrong,</v>

2161
02:02:57.070 --> 02:02:57.903
<v Speaker 6>but it's an interesting structure </v>
<v Speaker 6>because everything has its place order </v>

2162
02:03:02.201 --> 02:03:04.060
<v Speaker 6>and chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 6>masculine and feminine,</v>

2163
02:03:04.150 --> 02:03:08.950
<v Speaker 6>but even more importantly good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's the landscape.</v>

2164
02:03:09.250 --> 02:03:10.180
<v Speaker 6>And then we can say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2165
02:03:10.181 --> 02:03:14.350
<v Speaker 6>you can parcel out partial stories from </v>
<v Speaker 6>now and they have functional utility and</v>

2166
02:03:14.410 --> 02:03:18.520
<v Speaker 6>potent motivational force,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're dangerously one sided.</v>

2167
02:03:18.521 --> 02:03:20.260
<v Speaker 6>Unless you've covered the entire </v>
<v Speaker 6>territory.</v>

2168
02:03:25.730 --> 02:03:30.730
<v Speaker 3>We see that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they suggest by a part of this,</v>

2169
02:03:35.391 --> 02:03:39.570
<v Speaker 3>is this the way he's like Cyrus?</v>

2170
02:03:41.430 --> 02:03:42.560
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well that's exactly,</v>

2171
02:03:42.590 --> 02:03:45.480
<v Speaker 6>that's exactly how it looks to me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It is.</v>

2172
02:03:45.570 --> 02:03:46.403
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's something that's outside </v>

2173
02:03:47.371 --> 02:03:50.520
<v Speaker 6>rationality.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's embedded nodding rationality but in</v>

2174
02:03:50.521 --> 02:03:51.354
<v Speaker 6>biology and then knows essential claim </v>
<v Speaker 6>that you'll made with regards to the </v>

2175
02:03:54.121 --> 02:03:57.150
<v Speaker 6>collective unconscious and part of his,</v>
<v Speaker 6>believe me,</v>

2176
02:03:57.151 --> 02:03:57.984
<v Speaker 6>part of what human was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and this was partly in response to what </v>

2177
02:04:00.361 --> 02:04:04.440
<v Speaker 6>was happening mostly in Nazi Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but also to some degree in the communist</v>

2178
02:04:04.441 --> 02:04:05.670
<v Speaker 6>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is he was asking,</v>

2179
02:04:06.630 --> 02:04:11.580
<v Speaker 6>does do human beings have a nature?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Are we a certain way?</v>

2180
02:04:12.420 --> 02:04:15.030
<v Speaker 6>Because if we are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then that should be taken into account.</v>

2181
02:04:15.620 --> 02:04:16.453
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you're trying to construct our </v>

2182
02:04:17.231 --> 02:04:18.064
<v Speaker 6>political systems and if we do have a </v>
<v Speaker 6>nature well what is it and how does it </v>

2183
02:04:21.481 --> 02:04:25.320
<v Speaker 6>manifest itself and what should we,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how should we take stock of that?</v>

2184
02:04:25.650 --> 02:04:26.930
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>here's a question for you guys.</v>

2185
02:04:26.940 --> 02:04:27.773
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can think about this for a minute </v>

2186
02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:30.473
<v Speaker 6>now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was a paper published a week ago </v>

2187
02:04:33.900 --> 02:04:36.060
<v Speaker 6>and it was in the International Journal </v>
<v Speaker 6>of Psychology,</v>

2188
02:04:36.061 --> 02:04:39.660
<v Speaker 6>which is the world's psychology journal </v>
<v Speaker 6>for whatever that means,</v>

2189
02:04:39.661 --> 02:04:44.520
<v Speaker 6>but it was a large scale analysis of </v>
<v Speaker 6>gender differences across culture and it</v>

2190
02:04:45.390 --> 02:04:46.223
<v Speaker 6>concluded the same thing that all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>large scale analysis of gender </v>

2191
02:04:49.231 --> 02:04:53.370
<v Speaker 6>differences across culture have </v>
<v Speaker 6>concluded in the last 15 years,</v>

2192
02:04:53.610 --> 02:04:58.610
<v Speaker 6>which is that the differences taking </v>
<v Speaker 6>trade by trade are rather small</v>

2193
02:05:01.140 --> 02:05:03.660
<v Speaker 6>quarter to a half standard deviation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which isn't,</v>

2194
02:05:03.990 --> 02:05:07.680
<v Speaker 6>it's not trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it still means that along any single</v>

2195
02:05:07.681 --> 02:05:08.514
<v Speaker 6>trait dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 6>men and women are more the same than </v>

2196
02:05:10.201 --> 02:05:11.034
<v Speaker 6>they are different.</v>

2197
02:05:13.550 --> 02:05:17.580
<v Speaker 6>And those differences maximize as </v>
<v Speaker 6>societies become more egalitarian.</v>

2198
02:05:18.510 --> 02:05:19.343
<v Speaker 6>Now you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that should have been front page news </v>

2199
02:05:20.941 --> 02:05:23.760
<v Speaker 6>when that was first discovered because </v>
<v Speaker 6>it completely,</v>

2200
02:05:23.761 --> 02:05:27.840
<v Speaker 6>if it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it completely undermines everything that</v>

2201
02:05:27.841 --> 02:05:28.674
<v Speaker 6>students have been taught by radical </v>
<v Speaker 6>left wingers since the 1960s it </v>

2202
02:05:31.651 --> 02:05:36.651
<v Speaker 6>completely invalidates the claim that </v>
<v Speaker 6>people are constructed by society.</v>

2203
02:05:38.410 --> 02:05:39.243
<v Speaker 6>Because if they're constructed by </v>
<v Speaker 6>society and you make the state </v>

2204
02:05:41.740 --> 02:05:44.530
<v Speaker 6>egalitarian,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then the gender differences disappear.</v>

2205
02:05:45.100 --> 02:05:47.950
<v Speaker 6>But that isn't what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not only do they not disappeared,</v>

2206
02:05:47.980 --> 02:05:50.380
<v Speaker 6>which would be bad enough,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they maximize,</v>

2207
02:05:50.590 --> 02:05:51.550
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's it.</v>

2208
02:05:51.610 --> 02:05:54.100
<v Speaker 6>Theory done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now you could say,</v>

2209
02:05:54.101 --> 02:05:55.750
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the research isn't that good.</v>

2210
02:05:55.810 --> 02:05:56.860
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2211
02:05:56.920 --> 02:05:57.753
<v Speaker 6>that turns out to be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Most of it's done with the big five </v>

2212
02:06:00.280 --> 02:06:04.420
<v Speaker 6>personality model,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which I hated until like broop necessity</v>

2213
02:06:04.421 --> 02:06:06.820
<v Speaker 6>made me accept because they're kept </v>
<v Speaker 6>coming.</v>

2214
02:06:06.821 --> 02:06:10.930
<v Speaker 6>And why wasn't an interesting theory to </v>
<v Speaker 6>me it's like it was annoying.</v>

2215
02:06:11.170 --> 02:06:14.110
<v Speaker 6>Bloody statistician's figure out the </v>
<v Speaker 6>structure of personality,</v>

2216
02:06:14.111 --> 02:06:15.460
<v Speaker 6>how boring,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>

2217
02:06:15.461 --> 02:06:16.294
<v Speaker 6>But when you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you analyze the psychometrics </v>

2218
02:06:18.881 --> 02:06:22.330
<v Speaker 6>you're done,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like personality as encapsulated in</v>

2219
02:06:22.331 --> 02:06:25.210
<v Speaker 6>language has five dimensions now it's a </v>
<v Speaker 6>little rough around the edges.</v>

2220
02:06:25.211 --> 02:06:25.661
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2221
02:06:25.661 --> 02:06:27.130
<v Speaker 6>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's there.</v>

2222
02:06:27.670 --> 02:06:29.560
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fine.</v>

2223
02:06:29.710 --> 02:06:32.710
<v Speaker 6>So how big are those differences?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well if you add them up,</v>

2224
02:06:33.070 --> 02:06:37.150
<v Speaker 6>which you could,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the overlap between men and women is 10%</v>

2225
02:06:37.270 --> 02:06:38.103
<v Speaker 6>that's it.</v>

2226
02:06:38.140 --> 02:06:38.973
<v Speaker 6>So that means if you constructed a </v>
<v Speaker 6>regression equation using the big five </v>

2227
02:06:42.851 --> 02:06:46.300
<v Speaker 6>personality differences to predict who </v>
<v Speaker 6>was men and women,</v>

2228
02:06:46.330 --> 02:06:47.163
<v Speaker 6>men and woman,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just on the basis of the responses to </v>

2229
02:06:48.911 --> 02:06:49.744
<v Speaker 6>the personality traits,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could identify the genders with 90% </v>

2230
02:06:52.301 --> 02:06:55.360
<v Speaker 6>accuracy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's worse than that because the new</v>

2231
02:06:55.361 --> 02:06:56.194
<v Speaker 6>study showed that not only do there are </v>
<v Speaker 6>other differences that exist in </v>

2232
02:06:59.711 --> 02:07:02.380
<v Speaker 6>personality that are that small </v>
<v Speaker 6>individually,</v>

2233
02:07:02.410 --> 02:07:05.170
<v Speaker 6>but that large in combination.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But there are differences,</v>

2234
02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:08.590
<v Speaker 6>differences in blood pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maximize in egalitarian societies,</v>

2235
02:07:08.920 --> 02:07:11.860
<v Speaker 6>differences in the market,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the dark triad traits,</v>

2236
02:07:11.861 --> 02:07:14.620
<v Speaker 6>the Makaveli Ism and I don't remember </v>
<v Speaker 6>what the other two are.</v>

2237
02:07:14.740 --> 02:07:19.690
<v Speaker 6>Maximizing Egalitarian states like all </v>
<v Speaker 6>sorts of differences maximize.</v>

2238
02:07:19.691 --> 02:07:21.460
<v Speaker 6>And then you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well why is that?</v>

2239
02:07:21.820 --> 02:07:24.550
<v Speaker 6>And then there's a simple explanation </v>
<v Speaker 6>and the simple explanation.</v>

2240
02:07:24.551 --> 02:07:29.320
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Differences between men and women have a</v>

2241
02:07:29.321 --> 02:07:31.300
<v Speaker 6>partial basis in biology.</v>

2242
02:07:32.180 --> 02:07:32.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2243
02:07:32.860 --> 02:07:36.100
<v Speaker 6>If you eradicate the cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know</v>

2244
02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:37.173
<v Speaker 5>the environmental variability by making </v>
<v Speaker 5>the state egalitarian all you leave or </v>

2245
02:07:40.571 --> 02:07:43.390
<v Speaker 5>the biological differences which </v>
<v Speaker 5>maximize,</v>

2246
02:07:43.750 --> 02:07:47.570
<v Speaker 5>it's like</v>
<v Speaker 5>dispute that.</v>

2247
02:07:47.810 --> 02:07:48.643
<v Speaker 5>How can you dispute that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like something that someone </v>

2248
02:07:51.261 --> 02:07:54.080
<v Speaker 5>planned,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one was aiming at that.</v>

2249
02:07:54.290 --> 02:07:55.940
<v Speaker 5>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's how it happened.</v>

2250
02:07:56.360 --> 02:08:00.110
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there is evidence we could say,</v>

2251
02:08:00.111 --> 02:08:00.944
<v Speaker 5>well there is powerful evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 5>people have a biological nature and </v>

2252
02:08:04.191 --> 02:08:06.560
<v Speaker 5>inbuilt nature and then we could also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you can say,</v>

2253
02:08:06.561 --> 02:08:08.120
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's take that set of data.</v>

2254
02:08:08.480 --> 02:08:09.313
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The biggest difference between men and </v>

2255
02:08:13.301 --> 02:08:14.320
<v Speaker 5>women is an interest</v>

2256
02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:16.593
<v Speaker 5>and the interest dimension seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>people versus things women are more </v>

2257
02:08:20.201 --> 02:08:22.570
<v Speaker 5>interested in people and men are more </v>
<v Speaker 5>interested in things.</v>

2258
02:08:23.110 --> 02:08:25.240
<v Speaker 5>And the difference there is about a </v>
<v Speaker 5>standard deviation.</v>

2259
02:08:25.390 --> 02:08:29.080
<v Speaker 5>It's a big difference by by </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychological standards.</v>

2260
02:08:29.890 --> 02:08:30.723
<v Speaker 5>And it's a nice finding because you know</v>
<v Speaker 5>for a while one of the claims was that </v>

2261
02:08:34.361 --> 02:08:36.610
<v Speaker 5>there were fewer women in stem </v>
<v Speaker 5>disciplines,</v>

2262
02:08:36.611 --> 02:08:37.540
<v Speaker 5>science,</v>
<v Speaker 5>technology,</v>

2263
02:08:37.541 --> 02:08:38.374
<v Speaker 5>engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mathematics was because the standard </v>

2264
02:08:40.691 --> 02:08:43.930
<v Speaker 5>deviation of male intelligence was </v>
<v Speaker 5>larger because the curve was flatter.</v>

2265
02:08:43.970 --> 02:08:44.803
<v Speaker 5>So there were more intellectually </v>
<v Speaker 5>impaired men and more sort of super </v>

2266
02:08:47.111 --> 02:08:47.944
<v Speaker 5>genius men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's a biological rationale for </v>

2267
02:08:49.901 --> 02:08:52.270
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then one of the consequences of that</v>

2268
02:08:52.271 --> 02:08:53.104
<v Speaker 5>was that if you went five standard </v>
<v Speaker 5>deviations from the mean and you needed </v>

2269
02:08:56.201 --> 02:08:57.034
<v Speaker 5>that to be like an expert physicist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was so rare that the only people </v>

2270
02:09:00.551 --> 02:09:01.384
<v Speaker 5>who were out there were men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what it's like the reason that </v>

2271
02:09:03.791 --> 02:09:04.624
<v Speaker 5>most of the people in prison are manage </v>
<v Speaker 5>because the distribution of </v>

2272
02:09:07.781 --> 02:09:11.660
<v Speaker 5>agreeableness is skewed and there's way </v>
<v Speaker 5>more disagreeable man at the extreme,</v>

2273
02:09:11.661 --> 02:09:12.820
<v Speaker 5>so they all end up in prison.</v>

2274
02:09:13.870 --> 02:09:17.290
<v Speaker 5>That argument has not been settled,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think you can just put it aside.</v>

2275
02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:18.153
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of debate about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So Larry Summers brought it up at </v>

2276
02:09:20.201 --> 02:09:21.034
<v Speaker 5>Harvard and got fired as a consequence </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then a variety of female </v>

2277
02:09:24.820 --> 02:09:29.290
<v Speaker 5>psychologist scoured the ICU literature </v>
<v Speaker 5>and made the claim that that finding was</v>

2278
02:09:29.291 --> 02:09:31.360
<v Speaker 5>questionable to say the least.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And maybe it is,</v>

2279
02:09:31.361 --> 02:09:32.680
<v Speaker 5>maybe it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't matter.</v>

2280
02:09:32.681 --> 02:09:33.550
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's debatable.</v>

2281
02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:38.260
<v Speaker 5>What you do find though is that if you </v>
<v Speaker 5>look at male and female performance,</v>

2282
02:09:38.261 --> 02:09:40.420
<v Speaker 5>say in mathematics in junior high or </v>
<v Speaker 5>high school,</v>

2283
02:09:40.421 --> 02:09:41.254
<v Speaker 5>you can find a chunk of three to four </v>
<v Speaker 5>standard deviation above the mean </v>

2284
02:09:44.291 --> 02:09:47.500
<v Speaker 5>females and none of them go into stem </v>
<v Speaker 5>studies.</v>

2285
02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:48.813
<v Speaker 5>And why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems to be because they don't want </v>

2286
02:09:51.041 --> 02:09:52.390
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2287
02:09:52.660 --> 02:09:56.080
<v Speaker 5>I like that explanation because you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

2288
02:09:56.081 --> 02:09:58.720
<v Speaker 5>if you had to have an explanation that </v>
<v Speaker 5>was palatable,</v>

2289
02:09:58.810 --> 02:09:59.710
<v Speaker 5>that would be a good one.</v>

2290
02:09:59.710 --> 02:10:00.543
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't make a claim for anything </v>

2291
02:10:02.381 --> 02:10:04.630
<v Speaker 5>that has to do with the intrinsic </v>
<v Speaker 5>differences in ability.</v>

2292
02:10:05.170 --> 02:10:06.003
<v Speaker 5>So that's kind of Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wipes out a whole deep politicizes a </v>

2293
02:10:09.071 --> 02:10:11.380
<v Speaker 5>huge chunk of the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then you could say,</v>

2294
02:10:11.381 --> 02:10:12.214
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe men and women are like different </v>

2295
02:10:15.791 --> 02:10:17.650
<v Speaker 5>things because of socialization.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2296
02:10:17.651 --> 02:10:18.484
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't say that because that isn't </v>

2297
02:10:19.451 --> 02:10:22.150
<v Speaker 5>how it worked out in Scandinavia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's the end of that argument.</v>

2298
02:10:22.151 --> 02:10:25.690
<v Speaker 5>Unless you can figure out how those </v>
<v Speaker 5>studies are wrong and like,</v>

2299
02:10:25.691 --> 02:10:26.524
<v Speaker 5>good luck to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I've never seen a credible </v>

2300
02:10:28.060 --> 02:10:28.893
<v Speaker 5>explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the next thing you could say </v>

2301
02:10:31.031 --> 02:10:31.721
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2302
02:10:31.721 --> 02:10:35.780
<v Speaker 5>regardless about men and women should be</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same.</v>

2303
02:10:36.230 --> 02:10:38.120
<v Speaker 5>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No problem.</v>

2304
02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:42.130
<v Speaker 5>You could do it if you want to make,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you want to take,</v>

2305
02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:43.273
<v Speaker 5>say you have two kids that are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are adopted out at birth and </v>

2306
02:10:46.371 --> 02:10:47.204
<v Speaker 5>they're twins,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you assess their Iq and you look at </v>

2307
02:10:49.641 --> 02:10:52.220
<v Speaker 5>it in relationship to their </v>
<v Speaker 5>socioeconomic status.</v>

2308
02:10:52.550 --> 02:10:53.383
<v Speaker 5>One kids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it ends up in a family that's poor that </v>

2309
02:10:55.461 --> 02:11:00.461
<v Speaker 5>95% of other families and other kid ends</v>
<v Speaker 5>up in a family that's richer than 95% of</v>

2310
02:11:00.981 --> 02:11:02.690
<v Speaker 5>families.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's a big difference.</v>

2311
02:11:03.410 --> 02:11:06.740
<v Speaker 5>The kid in the richer home,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll have a 15 point Iq advantage.</v>

2312
02:11:07.100 --> 02:11:08.650
<v Speaker 5>So what that basically means,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

2313
02:11:08.660 --> 02:11:09.493
<v Speaker 5>I've got the statistics a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrong here because I can't translate it </v>

2314
02:11:11.931 --> 02:11:14.420
<v Speaker 5>onto the normal distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but roughly speaking,</v>

2315
02:11:14.421 --> 02:11:18.770
<v Speaker 5>what it means is that you need a three </v>
<v Speaker 5>standard deviation move in socioeconomic</v>

2316
02:11:18.771 --> 02:11:21.140
<v Speaker 5>status to produce a one standard </v>
<v Speaker 5>deviation move.</v>

2317
02:11:21.141 --> 02:11:21.974
<v Speaker 5>In Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what it implies is that you can buy </v>

2318
02:11:24.350 --> 02:11:25.183
<v Speaker 5>transformation of Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what it also indicates is that it's </v>

2319
02:11:27.741 --> 02:11:30.530
<v Speaker 5>bloody expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's extent that makes sense,</v>

2320
02:11:30.531 --> 02:11:31.430
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could,</v>

2321
02:11:31.431 --> 02:11:32.264
<v Speaker 5>you could imagine that being the case.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you spend enough money you could </v>

2322
02:11:34.881 --> 02:11:37.620
<v Speaker 5>switch something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I would say no.</v>

2323
02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:41.360
<v Speaker 5>The farther you want to switch it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more expensive it's going to get.</v>

2324
02:11:41.480 --> 02:11:42.313
<v Speaker 5>And it's probably a curve like this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a diminishing return things so that </v>

2325
02:11:45.380 --> 02:11:47.630
<v Speaker 5>maybe the first five points would be </v>
<v Speaker 5>pretty easy.</v>

2326
02:11:47.900 --> 02:11:49.940
<v Speaker 5>The next five things are getting </v>
<v Speaker 5>expensive.</v>

2327
02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:50.953
<v Speaker 5>The five after that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really expensive and then each </v>

2328
02:11:53.691 --> 02:11:56.330
<v Speaker 5>additional one point is going to cost a </v>
<v Speaker 5>lot.</v>

2329
02:11:56.780 --> 02:11:57.613
<v Speaker 5>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fine.</v>

2330
02:11:58.670 --> 02:12:01.910
<v Speaker 5>So what that means is that even if the </v>
<v Speaker 5>differences are biological,</v>

2331
02:12:02.150 --> 02:12:05.450
<v Speaker 5>you can shift them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The question is two questions,</v>

2332
02:12:05.720 --> 02:12:08.420
<v Speaker 5>how much effort are you willing to put </v>
<v Speaker 5>in?</v>

2333
02:12:09.260 --> 02:12:10.093
<v Speaker 5>And then the next question is how much </v>
<v Speaker 5>effort do you put in before it's a </v>

2334
02:12:12.711 --> 02:12:16.400
<v Speaker 5>tyranny?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's the real question.</v>

2335
02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:19.340
<v Speaker 5>So we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2336
02:12:19.341 --> 02:12:22.460
<v Speaker 5>radically transformed the socialization </v>
<v Speaker 5>of boys and girls.</v>

2337
02:12:22.461 --> 02:12:23.294
<v Speaker 5>Now this is being called for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Before there was a guy psychologist and </v>

2338
02:12:26.641 --> 02:12:28.910
<v Speaker 5>appalling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was an appalling article.</v>

2339
02:12:28.970 --> 02:12:29.803
<v Speaker 5>I think he was a social psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which would make sense because most of </v>

2340
02:12:32.781 --> 02:12:33.614
<v Speaker 5>what they do is appalling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so he proposed that the way to </v>

2341
02:12:38.390 --> 02:12:39.223
<v Speaker 5>decrease the radical difference in </v>
<v Speaker 5>aggression rates between men and women </v>

2342
02:12:42.381 --> 02:12:45.470
<v Speaker 5>was to socialize little boys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like little girls,</v>

2343
02:12:45.830 --> 02:12:46.663
<v Speaker 5>and that's been put into practice a lot </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it will not work because what will </v>

2344
02:12:50.511 --> 02:12:51.500
<v Speaker 5>happen is that you'll,</v>

2345
02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:56.810
<v Speaker 5>you might reduce the aggression of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>average guy,</v>

2346
02:12:57.080 --> 02:12:57.913
<v Speaker 5>but you're going to pop up the </v>
<v Speaker 5>aggression of the pathological guide by </v>

2347
02:13:00.111 --> 02:13:00.944
<v Speaker 5>such a degree that it will completely </v>
<v Speaker 5>overwhelm whatever minor gains you make </v>

2348
02:13:03.501 --> 02:13:04.334
<v Speaker 5>for the typical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you're just going to produce more </v>

2349
02:13:05.601 --> 02:13:10.010
<v Speaker 5>guys that are so bad that they're like </v>
<v Speaker 5>hell band for for revenge fundamentally.</v>

2350
02:13:10.490 --> 02:13:11.840
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

2351
02:13:11.841 --> 02:13:13.310
<v Speaker 5>But you could make that case,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2352
02:13:13.311 --> 02:13:14.144
<v Speaker 5>like from a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from a scientific or political </v>

2353
02:13:15.681 --> 02:13:16.700
<v Speaker 5>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could say,</v>

2354
02:13:16.701 --> 02:13:17.534
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's worth investing in the </v>

2355
02:13:19.011 --> 02:13:21.230
<v Speaker 5>transformation of the socialization </v>
<v Speaker 5>process.</v>

2356
02:13:21.231 --> 02:13:23.990
<v Speaker 5>So we get rid of those differences.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2357
02:13:23.991 --> 02:13:25.680
<v Speaker 5>The next thing you got to ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

2358
02:13:25.790 --> 02:13:26.623
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>

2359
02:13:27.650 --> 02:13:28.483
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

2360
02:13:29.230 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 5>What's the end game?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now here's the end</v>

2361
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:35.670
<v Speaker 6>game.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Men and women will be represented 50% in</v>

2362
02:13:35.671 --> 02:13:39.780
<v Speaker 6>absolutely every occupation and there </v>
<v Speaker 6>will be zero differences in economic and</v>

2363
02:13:39.781 --> 02:13:41.160
<v Speaker 6>political power.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay?</v>

2364
02:13:41.640 --> 02:13:46.470
<v Speaker 6>That end game presumes that that outcome</v>
<v Speaker 6>has a value.</v>

2365
02:13:47.190 --> 02:13:48.480
<v Speaker 6>We know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what the value is,</v>

2366
02:13:48.481 --> 02:13:49.314
<v Speaker 6>but some valid and then the more </v>
<v Speaker 6>resources you're willing to dump into </v>

2367
02:13:52.350 --> 02:13:53.183
<v Speaker 6>attain that end,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the more valuable your acting as if it </v>

2368
02:13:56.521 --> 02:13:59.820
<v Speaker 6>is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you could think about it as a utopian</v>

2369
02:14:00.660 --> 02:14:05.490
<v Speaker 6>or Utopian in state.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I'm not complaining about the formal</v>

2370
02:14:05.491 --> 02:14:07.920
<v Speaker 6>proposition that that would be a utopian</v>
<v Speaker 6>end state.</v>

2371
02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:09.173
<v Speaker 6>What I'm complaining about is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or what I'm commenting on is who says </v>

2372
02:14:12.901 --> 02:14:16.920
<v Speaker 6>that's the desire blow come and how much</v>
<v Speaker 6>are you willing to risk to test it out?</v>

2373
02:14:18.120 --> 02:14:21.180
<v Speaker 6>So because what you'll have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially for things like interest,</v>

2374
02:14:21.181 --> 02:14:26.181
<v Speaker 6>is you'll have to punish boys for being </v>
<v Speaker 6>interested in boy things and reward them</v>

2375
02:14:26.641 --> 02:14:27.474
<v Speaker 6>for being interested in girl things and </v>
<v Speaker 6>punish girls for being interested in </v>

2376
02:14:30.841 --> 02:14:33.810
<v Speaker 6>girl things and reward them for being </v>
<v Speaker 6>interested in boy things.</v>

2377
02:14:33.900 --> 02:14:35.580
<v Speaker 6>Now I think you could do that,</v>

2378
02:14:35.980 --> 02:14:40.030
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

2379
02:14:41.770 --> 02:14:43.240
<v Speaker 6>what if they're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2380
02:14:43.330 --> 02:14:45.670
<v Speaker 6>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the differences exist.</v>

2381
02:14:46.780 --> 02:14:49.210
<v Speaker 6>Why eradicate them?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you want them eradicated?</v>

2382
02:14:49.240 --> 02:14:52.600
<v Speaker 6>Do you really want them eradicated?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you know the word eradicated?</v>

2383
02:14:52.630 --> 02:14:53.463
<v Speaker 6>That's a rough word because you just </v>
<v Speaker 6>never know how far you're going to have </v>

2384
02:14:55.511 --> 02:14:57.070
<v Speaker 6>to go to eradicate.</v>

2385
02:14:57.170 --> 02:14:59.030
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2386
02:15:00.610 --> 02:15:01.550
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's see,</v>

2387
02:15:01.551 --> 02:15:03.590
<v Speaker 3>what time is it with their habit break?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2388
02:15:03.890 --> 02:15:04.820
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's three 30.</v>

2389
02:15:06.500 --> 02:15:07.190
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no more,</v>

2390
02:15:07.190 --> 02:15:09.110
<v Speaker 3>not much point in a break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2391
02:15:09.111 --> 02:15:10.400
<v Speaker 3>So let me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2392
02:15:15.310 --> 02:15:18.770
<v Speaker 3>Neurobiology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they started doing experiments very,</v>

2393
02:15:19.470 --> 02:15:23.960
<v Speaker 3>they basically tried growing neurons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different hormones,</v>

2394
02:15:24.420 --> 02:15:27.200
<v Speaker 3>and I found that neurons growing </v>
<v Speaker 3>estrogen,</v>

2395
02:15:27.580 --> 02:15:28.413
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they grow completely differently than </v>

2396
02:15:31.130 --> 02:15:32.930
<v Speaker 3>other things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which makes sense,</v>

2397
02:15:32.931 --> 02:15:35.150
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If gender differences of biological,</v>

2398
02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:37.460
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the upshot to that is,</v>

2399
02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:41.630
<v Speaker 3>it works with sort of that theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have to add on is that,</v>

2400
02:15:42.710 --> 02:15:43.543
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are men and women with different </v>

2401
02:15:44.541 --> 02:15:47.150
<v Speaker 3>levels of hormone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not uniform across sex.</v>

2402
02:15:47.870 --> 02:15:52.160
<v Speaker 3>So when you look at how you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>raise a child,</v>

2403
02:15:53.240 --> 02:15:54.520
<v Speaker 3>you can't just say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2404
02:15:54.570 --> 02:15:56.660
<v Speaker 3>it's a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You raised him like a girl.</v>

2405
02:15:57.900 --> 02:16:00.620
<v Speaker 3>You have to look at either a hormone </v>
<v Speaker 3>levels,</v>

2406
02:16:00.621 --> 02:16:03.000
<v Speaker 3>but because you can't access those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to look at their,</v>

2407
02:16:03.090 --> 02:16:04.730
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their gender identity.</v>

2408
02:16:05.830 --> 02:16:06.960
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>While they're there,</v>

2409
02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:07.913
<v Speaker 6>but to see that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's an individual relationship </v>

2410
02:16:09.790 --> 02:16:11.260
<v Speaker 6>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2411
02:16:11.261 --> 02:16:12.640
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2412
02:16:12.910 --> 02:16:14.640
<v Speaker 6>I've had children and</v>

2413
02:16:17.140 --> 02:16:21.160
<v Speaker 6>they seem to have turned out reasonably </v>
<v Speaker 6>well and you know,</v>

2414
02:16:21.161 --> 02:16:21.994
<v Speaker 6>there was a variety of differences </v>
<v Speaker 6>between them temperamentally that I </v>

2415
02:16:25.091 --> 02:16:27.500
<v Speaker 6>observed as they were growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2416
02:16:27.970 --> 02:16:32.970
<v Speaker 6>it turns out my daughter is quite tilted</v>
<v Speaker 6>towards a feminine temperament.</v>

2417
02:16:35.400 --> 02:16:39.670
<v Speaker 6>I tested her personality multiple times.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She tests all the personalities,</v>

2418
02:16:39.910 --> 02:16:42.580
<v Speaker 6>she tests the personalities of all her </v>
<v Speaker 6>potential dates,</v>

2419
02:16:42.810 --> 02:16:44.830
<v Speaker 6>which I think is really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2420
02:16:45.460 --> 02:16:46.293
<v Speaker 6>And my son has a very masculine </v>
<v Speaker 6>temperament so he's very low in </v>

2421
02:16:48.611 --> 02:16:50.630
<v Speaker 6>agreeableness and very high emotional </v>
<v Speaker 6>stability.</v>

2422
02:16:50.631 --> 02:16:53.380
<v Speaker 6>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so I can see that manifesting itself and</v>

2423
02:16:53.381 --> 02:16:54.214
<v Speaker 6>what you do if you have a relationship </v>
<v Speaker 6>with your kids as you adjust your </v>

2424
02:16:57.371 --> 02:16:59.410
<v Speaker 6>interactions with them according to who </v>
<v Speaker 6>they are.</v>

2425
02:16:59.411 --> 02:17:00.244
<v Speaker 6>Because in principle you want,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe it seems to me then in principle </v>

2426
02:17:04.480 --> 02:17:07.420
<v Speaker 6>maybe you want who they are to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>allowed to emerge.</v>

2427
02:17:07.900 --> 02:17:10.660
<v Speaker 6>Now I think there's some evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what good parents do.</v>

2428
02:17:10.660 --> 02:17:11.493
<v Speaker 6>And the reason I think that is because </v>
<v Speaker 6>when you're looking at influences on </v>

2429
02:17:15.161 --> 02:17:18.160
<v Speaker 6>children,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can look out genetic influences,</v>

2430
02:17:18.790 --> 02:17:19.623
<v Speaker 6>non shared environmental,</v>
<v Speaker 6>various and shared environmental </v>

2431
02:17:21.941 --> 02:17:23.440
<v Speaker 6>therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So shared environment.</v>

2432
02:17:23.590 --> 02:17:24.423
<v Speaker 6>Well variants would be if you and I were</v>
<v Speaker 6>brother and sister in the same family </v>

2433
02:17:27.430 --> 02:17:28.263
<v Speaker 6>shared environmental,</v>
<v Speaker 6>various would be what was common across </v>

2434
02:17:30.611 --> 02:17:34.270
<v Speaker 6>our upbringings.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Unshared environmental variance would be</v>

2435
02:17:34.271 --> 02:17:37.510
<v Speaker 6>what was specific to you in our family </v>
<v Speaker 6>and what was specific to me.</v>

2436
02:17:37.630 --> 02:17:39.630
<v Speaker 6>And then the biological stuff is </v>
<v Speaker 6>biological.</v>

2437
02:17:39.640 --> 02:17:44.640
<v Speaker 6>What you almost always find in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>studies is that non shared environmental</v>

2438
02:17:45.161 --> 02:17:49.690
<v Speaker 6>variance is the most powerful after </v>
<v Speaker 6>biological predisposition depends on the</v>

2439
02:17:49.691 --> 02:17:50.524
<v Speaker 6>trade.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so what that seems to indicate is </v>

2440
02:17:52.091 --> 02:17:56.560
<v Speaker 6>that the general mill you in which </v>
<v Speaker 6>children is raised has hardly any effect</v>

2441
02:17:56.561 --> 02:18:00.220
<v Speaker 6>whatsoever on their,</v>
<v Speaker 6>on their treat outcomes.</v>

2442
02:18:00.460 --> 02:18:03.070
<v Speaker 6>Now you can be pessimistic or optimistic</v>
<v Speaker 6>about that.</v>

2443
02:18:03.220 --> 02:18:04.053
<v Speaker 6>If you're pessimistic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you say parenting doesn't matter and </v>

2444
02:18:06.671 --> 02:18:08.290
<v Speaker 6>people have drawn that conclusion.</v>

2445
02:18:08.290 --> 02:18:10.420
<v Speaker 6>There was a famous book written about </v>
<v Speaker 6>that a while back.</v>

2446
02:18:10.830 --> 02:18:13.630
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if you're optimistic,</v>

2447
02:18:13.631 --> 02:18:14.370
<v Speaker 6>what you say is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2448
02:18:14.370 --> 02:18:14.611
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2449
02:18:14.611 --> 02:18:14.961
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2450
02:18:14.961 --> 02:18:16.360
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't get it.</v>

2451
02:18:16.810 --> 02:18:17.643
<v Speaker 6>If you were a good parent,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you were radicchio the shared variance </v>

2452
02:18:20.110 --> 02:18:20.943
<v Speaker 6>because what you do is have an </v>
<v Speaker 6>individual relationship with each child </v>

2453
02:18:23.121 --> 02:18:25.030
<v Speaker 6>that takes into account their </v>
<v Speaker 6>temperamental,</v>

2454
02:18:25.450 --> 02:18:26.283
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>idiosyncrasies and you tailor the </v>

2455
02:18:28.121 --> 02:18:28.954
<v Speaker 6>environment to them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so the shared the shared </v>

2456
02:18:30.761 --> 02:18:33.730
<v Speaker 6>environmental various disappears because</v>
<v Speaker 6>there is no shared environment.</v>

2457
02:18:34.300 --> 02:18:35.133
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like go on 10 dates and treat each </v>

2458
02:18:38.921 --> 02:18:39.754
<v Speaker 6>man you meet or each woman you meet as </v>
<v Speaker 6>if they were exactly the same and see </v>

2459
02:18:43.781 --> 02:18:45.520
<v Speaker 6>how far you get,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2460
02:18:45.521 --> 02:18:49.630
<v Speaker 6>You're going to be one annoying person </v>
<v Speaker 6>and you know probability you're going to</v>

2461
02:18:49.631 --> 02:18:51.670
<v Speaker 6>get brushed off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what you want to do is,</v>

2462
02:18:52.210 --> 02:18:53.043
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>take the gender into account as a broad </v>

2463
02:18:54.760 --> 02:18:55.920
<v Speaker 6>template.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2464
02:18:55.990 --> 02:18:59.080
<v Speaker 6>cause you need to set up your </v>
<v Speaker 6>expectations and then rapidly Taylor the</v>

2465
02:18:59.081 --> 02:18:59.914
<v Speaker 6>hell out of that as fast as you can to </v>
<v Speaker 6>indicate that you've got some social </v>

2466
02:19:02.710 --> 02:19:04.000
<v Speaker 6>sophistication.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2467
02:19:04.001 --> 02:19:05.440
<v Speaker 6>While you do the same thing with </v>
<v Speaker 6>children.</v>

2468
02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:06.753
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So then,</v>

2469
02:19:07.270 --> 02:19:08.103
<v Speaker 6>but that still begs the question and </v>
<v Speaker 6>this is something that you guys can </v>

2470
02:19:11.351 --> 02:19:12.184
<v Speaker 6>think about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like</v>

2471
02:19:14.830 --> 02:19:16.090
<v Speaker 6>what do you do about the differences?</v>

2472
02:19:18.380 --> 02:19:19.213
<v Speaker 2>Do you leave them?</v>

2473
02:19:19.820 --> 02:19:22.620
<v Speaker 6>Do you encourage them?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's another thing you could see.</v>

2474
02:19:22.621 --> 02:19:25.720
<v Speaker 6>You could say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>see the thing that I,</v>

2475
02:19:25.750 --> 02:19:28.490
<v Speaker 6>one of the things I really dislike about</v>
<v Speaker 6>the social constructionists</v>

2476
02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:30.920
<v Speaker 5>stances,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that there was an implication that comes</v>

2477
02:19:30.921 --> 02:19:32.600
<v Speaker 5>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's the implication.</v>

2478
02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.940
<v Speaker 5>Men and women are the same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

2479
02:19:37.970 --> 02:19:40.130
<v Speaker 5>well why is that necessary?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2480
02:19:40.131 --> 02:19:44.360
<v Speaker 5>because that similarity is valuable </v>
<v Speaker 5>because otherwise white pursue it,</v>

2481
02:19:44.390 --> 02:19:45.740
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because it's valuable.</v>

2482
02:19:45.741 --> 02:19:49.490
<v Speaker 5>So people are better off with near the </v>
<v Speaker 5>same fine.</v>

2483
02:19:50.060 --> 02:19:52.040
<v Speaker 5>People are worse off when they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>different.</v>

2484
02:19:52.340 --> 02:19:53.173
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why are they worse off when they're </v>

2485
02:19:54.291 --> 02:19:55.124
<v Speaker 5>different?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about because differences are not </v>

2486
02:19:56.691 --> 02:19:57.830
<v Speaker 5>acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

2487
02:19:57.831 --> 02:20:00.950
<v Speaker 5>well play out if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Differences are not acceptable.</v>

2488
02:20:01.220 --> 02:20:02.053
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could see where that would leave in </v>

2489
02:20:03.310 --> 02:20:05.110
<v Speaker 5>no time flat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

2490
02:20:05.150 --> 02:20:05.983
<v Speaker 5>So the mere proposition that men and </v>
<v Speaker 5>women are the same in a world where </v>

2491
02:20:09.291 --> 02:20:11.780
<v Speaker 5>there are differences,</v>
<v Speaker 5>has the implication that the differences</v>

2492
02:20:11.781 --> 02:20:14.630
<v Speaker 5>are substandard and maybe even </v>
<v Speaker 5>pathological.</v>

2493
02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:16.820
<v Speaker 5>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are they really,</v>

2494
02:20:16.880 --> 02:20:17.713
<v Speaker 5>is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it the case that to the degree we </v>

2495
02:20:19.281 --> 02:20:23.090
<v Speaker 5>defer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're not mutually complimentary and not</v>

2496
02:20:23.091 --> 02:20:25.040
<v Speaker 5>acceptable?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean as individuals and gender.</v>

2497
02:20:26.970 --> 02:20:27.803
<v Speaker 3>It is true that I feel like</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to pretend that we don't have </v>

2498
02:20:32.671 --> 02:20:34.440
<v Speaker 3>to force it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time,</v>

2499
02:20:34.441 --> 02:20:36.630
<v Speaker 3>and I feel like they're are also very </v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2500
02:20:37.830 --> 02:20:42.400
<v Speaker 3>like encouraging like other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially their culture,</v>

2501
02:20:43.380 --> 02:20:46.320
<v Speaker 3>they're also be about the same time of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like say well what?</v>

2502
02:20:46.321 --> 02:20:48.450
<v Speaker 3>All the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are no differences there.</v>

2503
02:20:48.460 --> 02:20:49.171
<v Speaker 3>Also like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2504
02:20:49.171 --> 02:20:50.730
<v Speaker 3>we should multicultural.</v>

2505
02:20:50.810 --> 02:20:52.630
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have a theory about that now.</v>

2506
02:20:52.660 --> 02:20:53.493
<v Speaker 5>So we just did a study of political </v>
<v Speaker 5>correctness because we wanted to find </v>

2507
02:20:56.411 --> 02:20:56.720
<v Speaker 5>out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2508
02:20:56.720 --> 02:20:57.553
<v Speaker 5>I'll get to write with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we wanted to find out if political </v>

2509
02:20:59.501 --> 02:21:01.180
<v Speaker 5>correctness existed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2510
02:21:01.210 --> 02:21:02.043
<v Speaker 5>Is it a margin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a set of values because it might not be </v>

2511
02:21:05.260 --> 02:21:06.093
<v Speaker 5>the left planes that the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 5>political correctness exists as a </v>

2512
02:21:09.191 --> 02:21:10.024
<v Speaker 5>homogenous set of constructs is a right </v>
<v Speaker 5>wing idea and that it's just wrong that </v>

2513
02:21:13.560 --> 02:21:15.250
<v Speaker 5>this the belief side,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so diverse.</v>

2514
02:21:15.251 --> 02:21:17.290
<v Speaker 5>You can't characterize it under a single</v>
<v Speaker 5>label.</v>

2515
02:21:17.500 --> 02:21:18.333
<v Speaker 5>It's easy to test.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What you do is you get a bunch of </v>

2516
02:21:20.650 --> 02:21:21.483
<v Speaker 5>statements that appear to be on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>politically correct side and you can do </v>

2517
02:21:24.221 --> 02:21:25.054
<v Speaker 5>that relatively objectively.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We had a bunch of people generate them </v>

2518
02:21:27.191 --> 02:21:29.140
<v Speaker 5>and we took clips from news items and </v>
<v Speaker 5>all of that.</v>

2519
02:21:29.141 --> 02:21:33.790
<v Speaker 5>So over generated to set,</v>
<v Speaker 5>asked a thousand people factor,</v>

2520
02:21:33.791 --> 02:21:34.840
<v Speaker 5>analyze the results.</v>

2521
02:21:34.840 --> 02:21:35.673
<v Speaker 5>And we've got two factors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One was sort of radical egalitarianism </v>

2522
02:21:38.920 --> 02:21:42.670
<v Speaker 5>and the other was language control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2523
02:21:42.850 --> 02:21:44.950
<v Speaker 5>And we've already done this for liberals</v>
<v Speaker 5>and conservatives.</v>

2524
02:21:44.980 --> 02:21:47.260
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the liberals are high in openness and</v>

2525
02:21:47.261 --> 02:21:50.470
<v Speaker 5>low in conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>particularly orderliness.</v>

2526
02:21:51.370 --> 02:21:54.550
<v Speaker 5>The conservatives are low in openness </v>
<v Speaker 5>and high in conscientiousness,</v>

2527
02:21:54.730 --> 02:21:57.910
<v Speaker 5>particularly orderliness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they're actually mirror images of one</v>

2528
02:21:57.911 --> 02:22:01.540
<v Speaker 5>another.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The politically correct people.</v>

2529
02:22:01.870 --> 02:22:04.330
<v Speaker 5>The first dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is radical egalitarianism,</v>

2530
02:22:04.480 --> 02:22:08.170
<v Speaker 5>they're primarily agreeable and low in </v>
<v Speaker 5>conscientiousness.</v>

2531
02:22:08.890 --> 02:22:10.060
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's different.</v>

2532
02:22:10.090 --> 02:22:13.090
<v Speaker 5>They're not hyper liberals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're off on a different axis.</v>

2533
02:22:13.360 --> 02:22:14.193
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The second dimension was high </v>

2534
02:22:17.531 --> 02:22:18.400
<v Speaker 5>agreeableness.</v>

2535
02:22:19.780 --> 02:22:20.613
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2536
02:22:20.630 --> 02:22:22.520
<v Speaker 5>Low conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that right?</v>

2537
02:22:22.550 --> 02:22:24.650
<v Speaker 5>Well conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hope that's right.</v>

2538
02:22:24.800 --> 02:22:27.090
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't exactly matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And low verbal Iq.</v>

2539
02:22:28.770 --> 02:22:29.940
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

2540
02:22:31.570 --> 02:22:33.100
<v Speaker 3>there was a reason I was telling you </v>
<v Speaker 3>that</v>

2541
02:22:34.880 --> 02:22:36.290
<v Speaker 5>can ask me your question again.</v>

2542
02:22:36.440 --> 02:22:40.040
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that a lot of left wing people,</v>

2543
02:22:40.041 --> 02:22:42.350
<v Speaker 3>they're all one had they tried to claim </v>
<v Speaker 3>that every day.</v>

2544
02:22:42.540 --> 02:22:43.980
<v Speaker 5>Oh Great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good,</v>

2545
02:22:43.981 --> 02:22:44.814
<v Speaker 5>good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>good.</v>

2546
02:22:44.820 --> 02:22:47.430
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the commonality.</v>

2547
02:22:47.520 --> 02:22:48.353
<v Speaker 5>So we've always,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we felt that and people make this claim </v>

2548
02:22:50.881 --> 02:22:51.714
<v Speaker 5>that there's something about the pc </v>
<v Speaker 5>stands that leads itself to a kind of </v>

2549
02:22:54.121 --> 02:22:54.954
<v Speaker 5>authoritarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's weird because a lot of the </v>

2550
02:22:57.451 --> 02:22:58.284
<v Speaker 5>research on authoritarianism and there's</v>
<v Speaker 5>historical reasons for that was </v>

2551
02:23:01.171 --> 02:23:04.770
<v Speaker 5>predicated on the claim that </v>
<v Speaker 5>authoritarianism was necessarily a right</v>

2552
02:23:04.771 --> 02:23:05.630
<v Speaker 5>lane phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2553
02:23:05.940 --> 02:23:07.530
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the authoritarian scale,</v>

2554
02:23:07.531 --> 02:23:10.110
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was derived by Theodore Adorno,</v>

2555
02:23:10.410 --> 02:23:13.200
<v Speaker 5>who was part of a left wing think tank,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2556
02:23:13.560 --> 02:23:15.480
<v Speaker 5>what were they called?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were in Germany,</v>

2557
02:23:15.750 --> 02:23:18.360
<v Speaker 5>I'll remember their name.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was after World War Two.</v>

2558
02:23:18.361 --> 02:23:19.194
<v Speaker 5>And they had every reason for assuming </v>
<v Speaker 5>that authoritarianism was the right way </v>

2559
02:23:21.400 --> 02:23:23.460
<v Speaker 5>phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 5>except for all the things the communists</v>

2560
02:23:23.461 --> 02:23:24.330
<v Speaker 5>were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

2561
02:23:24.780 --> 02:23:25.613
<v Speaker 5>forget about that for a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then there was a huge debate in the </v>

2562
02:23:27.541 --> 02:23:29.340
<v Speaker 5>psychological literature,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really tilt,</v>

2563
02:23:29.700 --> 02:23:30.533
<v Speaker 5>still going on about whether only the </v>
<v Speaker 5>right can be authoritarian or whether </v>

2564
02:23:33.961 --> 02:23:37.470
<v Speaker 5>the left and the right can be </v>
<v Speaker 5>authoritarian has never been sorted out.</v>

2565
02:23:37.800 --> 02:23:39.060
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what we found,</v>

2566
02:23:39.510 --> 02:23:43.920
<v Speaker 5>so the conservatives were high in </v>
<v Speaker 5>orderliness and low and opens.</v>

2567
02:23:44.310 --> 02:23:45.143
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So orderliness seems to be the </v>

2568
02:23:46.471 --> 02:23:47.304
<v Speaker 5>authoritarian aspect because </v>
<v Speaker 5>conscientious people like structure and </v>

2569
02:23:51.751 --> 02:23:55.110
<v Speaker 5>they'd like to compete with instructors </v>
<v Speaker 5>and conscientiousness predicts,</v>

2570
02:23:55.260 --> 02:23:56.670
<v Speaker 5>right wing beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

2571
02:23:56.790 --> 02:23:57.623
<v Speaker 5>but it isn't industriousness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is another part of the </v>

2572
02:23:59.520 --> 02:24:01.410
<v Speaker 5>conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Its orderliness.</v>

2573
02:24:01.890 --> 02:24:02.723
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The second dimension of the politically </v>

2574
02:24:06.751 --> 02:24:07.584
<v Speaker 5>correct people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The language control was agreeable and </v>

2575
02:24:10.561 --> 02:24:12.840
<v Speaker 5>orderly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then then the Iq.</v>

2576
02:24:12.870 --> 02:24:14.370
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so this is what we think.</v>

2577
02:24:14.371 --> 02:24:15.204
<v Speaker 5>Now this is Beckman but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's a good study and we'd been </v>

2578
02:24:18.301 --> 02:24:21.090
<v Speaker 5>trying hard to pin this down and this </v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't my idea by the way.</v>

2579
02:24:21.091 --> 02:24:23.700
<v Speaker 5>This is my graduate student's idea was </v>
<v Speaker 5>not very smart idea.</v>

2580
02:24:24.150 --> 02:24:27.890
<v Speaker 5>She thought authoritarianism is driven </v>
<v Speaker 5>by orderliness.</v>

2581
02:24:28.140 --> 02:24:30.390
<v Speaker 5>Okay fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you are agreeable,</v>

2582
02:24:30.420 --> 02:24:31.253
<v Speaker 5>you are authoritarian by inclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you're disagreeable and you're </v>

2583
02:24:34.621 --> 02:24:36.210
<v Speaker 5>authoritarian by exclusion.</v>

2584
02:24:36.930 --> 02:24:37.630
<v Speaker 5>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2585
02:24:37.630 --> 02:24:38.463
<v Speaker 5>the goal is homogeneity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the right way you say all you </v>

2586
02:24:42.691 --> 02:24:43.524
<v Speaker 5>different people screw off and the left </v>
<v Speaker 5>wing says all you different people come </v>

2587
02:24:46.981 --> 02:24:50.190
<v Speaker 5>in here and be the same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>

2588
02:24:50.250 --> 02:24:51.083
<v Speaker 5>So now I think the way that that </v>
<v Speaker 5>pertains to your question is that I </v>

2589
02:24:54.721 --> 02:24:55.554
<v Speaker 5>think the left wing manages that weirdly</v>
<v Speaker 5>paradoxical viewpoint by assuming that </v>

2590
02:25:00.391 --> 02:25:01.224
<v Speaker 5>whatever differences exist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our cultural and so they can just be in </v>

2591
02:25:04.561 --> 02:25:06.210
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can just be ameliorated.</v>

2592
02:25:07.050 --> 02:25:08.490
<v Speaker 5>That's what it looks like to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2593
02:25:08.491 --> 02:25:12.840
<v Speaker 5>it really does seem</v>
<v Speaker 5>paradoxical,</v>

2594
02:25:12.900 --> 02:25:14.340
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That you can,</v>

2595
02:25:14.370 --> 02:25:18.000
<v Speaker 5>you can be for an egalitarianism and </v>
<v Speaker 5>celebrate differences.</v>

2596
02:25:18.001 --> 02:25:21.760
<v Speaker 5>And you see this turns out very weirdly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let so many people,</v>

2597
02:25:22.350 --> 02:25:24.430
<v Speaker 5>well let,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let me you an example of what happened.</v>

2598
02:25:24.431 --> 02:25:26.800
<v Speaker 5>So do you guys know who I Ayaan Hirsi </v>
<v Speaker 5>Ali is?</v>

2599
02:25:26.820 --> 02:25:27.800
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do.</v>

2600
02:25:27.830 --> 02:25:30.070
<v Speaker 5>And how many of you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2601
02:25:30.100 --> 02:25:31.230
<v Speaker 5>now if you could keep it.</v>

2602
02:25:31.320 --> 02:25:32.030
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>

2603
02:25:32.030 --> 02:25:33.670
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's quite the day I'm character.</v>

2604
02:25:33.671 --> 02:25:34.870
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hadn't heard the elite.</v>

2605
02:25:34.871 --> 02:25:36.670
<v Speaker 5>I would look her up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think she's a real hero.</v>

2606
02:25:36.671 --> 02:25:38.740
<v Speaker 5>That woman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she is tough as a bloody boot.</v>

2607
02:25:39.130 --> 02:25:39.963
<v Speaker 5>She came from Ethiopia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she escaped from an arranged marriage </v>

2608
02:25:41.981 --> 02:25:45.150
<v Speaker 5>and she was in a very hierarchical,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2609
02:25:45.160 --> 02:25:49.090
<v Speaker 5>authoritarian Muslim family.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So she had to run and she did.</v>

2610
02:25:49.091 --> 02:25:51.400
<v Speaker 5>And so that was tough man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To get away from that.</v>

2611
02:25:51.820 --> 02:25:52.653
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she had to forfeit or familial ties and </v>

2612
02:25:54.041 --> 02:25:54.874
<v Speaker 5>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then she went to the Netherlands to </v>

2613
02:25:56.291 --> 02:25:57.124
<v Speaker 5>study and the Netherlands shocked her </v>
<v Speaker 5>and she said a couple of things that </v>

2614
02:26:01.931 --> 02:26:02.764
<v Speaker 5>shocked her that I thought were so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The first thing that shocked her was </v>

2615
02:26:04.991 --> 02:26:05.824
<v Speaker 5>that she was at a bus stop and there was</v>
<v Speaker 5>a little digital sign there that said </v>

2616
02:26:08.471 --> 02:26:09.304
<v Speaker 5>when the bus was coming and then the bus</v>
<v Speaker 5>came like right at the time it was </v>

2617
02:26:12.461 --> 02:26:13.294
<v Speaker 5>supposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she couldn't believe that that could </v>

2618
02:26:14.711 --> 02:26:15.580
<v Speaker 5>actually happen.</v>

2619
02:26:15.580 --> 02:26:16.413
<v Speaker 5>And if you think about how many things </v>
<v Speaker 5>have to be going right for that to </v>

2620
02:26:18.461 --> 02:26:19.294
<v Speaker 5>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know that her detection of that </v>

2621
02:26:21.341 --> 02:26:22.174
<v Speaker 5>miracle was accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the fact that we just assume that </v>

2622
02:26:25.210 --> 02:26:28.000
<v Speaker 5>that's just shows you how well things </v>
<v Speaker 5>work.</v>

2623
02:26:28.660 --> 02:26:32.620
<v Speaker 5>And the second thing she was amazed </v>
<v Speaker 5>about was that if you ask the policeman,</v>

2624
02:26:32.621 --> 02:26:33.454
<v Speaker 5>they would help you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because in most countries policemen are </v>

2625
02:26:36.570 --> 02:26:38.590
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're just an extension of thug,</v>

2626
02:26:38.620 --> 02:26:39.970
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't get paid anything.</v>

2627
02:26:39.971 --> 02:26:41.890
<v Speaker 5>So all the money they make,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's from you.</v>

2628
02:26:42.070 --> 02:26:44.680
<v Speaker 5>And they're not there to maintain order </v>
<v Speaker 5>or to help you.</v>

2629
02:26:44.950 --> 02:26:46.900
<v Speaker 5>They're there as a control arm of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>state.</v>

2630
02:26:47.260 --> 02:26:48.093
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she went and go to liberal arts </v>

2631
02:26:48.851 --> 02:26:53.851
<v Speaker 5>education and she was very taken by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>idea of individual sovereignty,</v>

2632
02:26:56.650 --> 02:26:57.483
<v Speaker 5>roughly speaking and the enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So she turned into a really pro </v>

2633
02:26:59.801 --> 02:27:00.634
<v Speaker 5>enlightenment person and then she got </v>
<v Speaker 5>into the Dutch parliament and she also </v>

2634
02:27:04.961 --> 02:27:07.270
<v Speaker 5>had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a bit of a scandal about that,</v>

2635
02:27:07.271 --> 02:27:08.110
<v Speaker 5>which I won't go into.</v>

2636
02:27:08.770 --> 02:27:09.603
<v Speaker 5>She also had a relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was just a friendship with </v>

2637
02:27:11.981 --> 02:27:12.814
<v Speaker 5>this guy named Van Gogh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who was actually a descendant of found </v>

2638
02:27:14.911 --> 02:27:15.744
<v Speaker 5>gold.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he made this video that have naked </v>

2639
02:27:17.771 --> 02:27:20.530
<v Speaker 5>women in it with verses of the Quran </v>
<v Speaker 5>written on them.</v>

2640
02:27:20.890 --> 02:27:21.760
<v Speaker 5>And it was very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

2641
02:27:21.761 --> 02:27:22.594
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very controversial because these were </v>

2642
02:27:23.531 --> 02:27:26.080
<v Speaker 5>anti female versus at least that's what </v>
<v Speaker 5>he thought.</v>

2643
02:27:26.380 --> 02:27:30.400
<v Speaker 5>And so he got stabbed and what happened </v>
<v Speaker 5>was the guy that stabbed him,</v>

2644
02:27:30.401 --> 02:27:34.300
<v Speaker 5>it was a Muslim extremists took the </v>
<v Speaker 5>note,</v>

2645
02:27:34.301 --> 02:27:38.140
<v Speaker 5>it explained why he was being killed and</v>
<v Speaker 5>stabbed it into him.</v>

2646
02:27:38.620 --> 02:27:39.880
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that was nasty.</v>

2647
02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:42.340
<v Speaker 5>So I ended Hirsi Ali.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eventually she,</v>

2648
02:27:42.341 --> 02:27:43.174
<v Speaker 5>her life was in danger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] to such a degree and a </v>

2649
02:27:45.671 --> 02:27:46.504
<v Speaker 5>variety of things happen at home that </v>
<v Speaker 5>she had to move to the United States </v>

2650
02:27:48.671 --> 02:27:49.504
<v Speaker 5>with bodyguards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so she lives there now and she's an </v>

2651
02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:58.080
<v Speaker 5>outspoken critic of patriarchal </v>
<v Speaker 5>oppressor in the best sense.</v>

2652
02:27:58.330 --> 02:28:00.370
<v Speaker 5>Like she experienced it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was terrible.</v>

2653
02:28:00.371 --> 02:28:05.371
<v Speaker 5>Like she got away from it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and in a really remarkable and honorable</v>

2654
02:28:07.091 --> 02:28:09.760
<v Speaker 5>and admirable way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I read,</v>

2655
02:28:09.761 --> 02:28:10.594
<v Speaker 5>I in Herzliya lead before she was </v>
<v Speaker 5>politically controversial except in </v>

2656
02:28:13.451 --> 02:28:14.530
<v Speaker 5>Holland.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2657
02:28:14.531 --> 02:28:15.364
<v Speaker 5>last year Brandeis University offered </v>
<v Speaker 5>her a honorary phd and the students set </v>

2658
02:28:21.441 --> 02:28:22.274
<v Speaker 5>up a petition saying that she couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>be granted that phd because of her </v>

2659
02:28:26.511 --> 02:28:31.511
<v Speaker 5>objection to two Muslim too radical </v>
<v Speaker 5>Muslim faith and they disinvited her.</v>

2660
02:28:31.790 --> 02:28:34.250
<v Speaker 5>So that's a good example of this weird </v>
<v Speaker 5>paradox.</v>

2661
02:28:34.251 --> 02:28:37.100
<v Speaker 5>It's like I read,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I Ayaan Hirsi Ali and I thought,</v>

2662
02:28:37.101 --> 02:28:39.650
<v Speaker 5>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if anybody ever had a case to make about</v>

2663
02:28:39.651 --> 02:28:40.484
<v Speaker 5>the oppressive nature of the patriarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like as someone who had personally </v>

2664
02:28:43.161 --> 02:28:43.994
<v Speaker 5>experienced it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like you read her story and you </v>

2665
02:28:45.951 --> 02:28:46.850
<v Speaker 5>think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

2666
02:28:46.851 --> 02:28:47.684
<v Speaker 5>there's no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so then she makes this immensely </v>

2667
02:28:50.871 --> 02:28:55.100
<v Speaker 5>complex and sophisticated case for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>individual rights of women.</v>

2668
02:28:55.580 --> 02:28:56.413
<v Speaker 5>And Brandeis invites her to give her an </v>
<v Speaker 5>honorary degree and then they resend it </v>

2669
02:29:00.021 --> 02:29:00.854
<v Speaker 5>because the students complain about her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that was the radical left students </v>

2670
02:29:02.931 --> 02:29:04.610
<v Speaker 5>who were complaining.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just thought,</v>

2671
02:29:05.090 --> 02:29:07.190
<v Speaker 5>well I thought first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's amazing.</v>

2672
02:29:07.200 --> 02:29:08.840
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just can't believe that happened.</v>

2673
02:29:08.841 --> 02:29:09.674
<v Speaker 5>It's second.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't believe that that pathetic </v>

2674
02:29:11.361 --> 02:29:15.290
<v Speaker 5>university cave and withdrew their,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their invitation to her.</v>

2675
02:29:15.500 --> 02:29:16.333
<v Speaker 5>She's a tough cookie man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think she's a real hero and that </v>

2676
02:29:19.881 --> 02:29:21.770
<v Speaker 5>was irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like some students were upset,</v>

2677
02:29:21.771 --> 02:29:22.604
<v Speaker 5>they made a petition.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like who cares about Ayaan Hirsi Ali </v>

2678
02:29:24.711 --> 02:29:26.090
<v Speaker 5>and her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2679
02:29:26.780 --> 02:29:27.890
<v Speaker 5>amazing journey.</v>

2680
02:29:28.280 --> 02:29:29.113
<v Speaker 3>I've noticed that like if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I bring up friendship infringements </v>

2681
02:29:32.641 --> 02:29:36.780
<v Speaker 3>on women's rights that contradicts like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the liberal narrative of like a straight</v>

2682
02:29:36.781 --> 02:29:40.350
<v Speaker 3>white</v>
<v Speaker 3>person maybe like,</v>

2683
02:29:40.490 --> 02:29:42.590
<v Speaker 3>it's like some poor people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2684
02:29:43.280 --> 02:29:44.200
<v Speaker 3>in a very like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2685
02:29:44.210 --> 02:29:46.460
<v Speaker 3>a Muslim majority country oppressing </v>
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>

2686
02:29:46.620 --> 02:29:47.453
<v Speaker 3>if I bring that up is I feel like a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of times like the gifts cause like it </v>

2687
02:29:51.241 --> 02:29:52.950
<v Speaker 3>contradicts that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the main narrative,</v>

2688
02:29:52.951 --> 02:29:53.820
<v Speaker 3>which is impressive.</v>

2689
02:29:54.860 --> 02:29:55.693
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the prog,</v>

2690
02:29:55.720 --> 02:29:57.050
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>generally the problem,</v>

2691
02:29:57.080 --> 02:29:57.913
<v Speaker 5>the problem with a set of axiomatic </v>
<v Speaker 5>presuppositions is that you'll find </v>

2692
02:30:01.041 --> 02:30:04.340
<v Speaker 5>situations where they conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can give you another example.</v>

2693
02:30:04.700 --> 02:30:06.080
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2694
02:30:06.440 --> 02:30:08.260
<v Speaker 5>that's definitely one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2695
02:30:08.261 --> 02:30:09.350
<v Speaker 5>so you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2696
02:30:09.920 --> 02:30:13.010
<v Speaker 5>diverse ethnicity and diverse cultural </v>
<v Speaker 5>background is a plus,</v>

2697
02:30:13.011 --> 02:30:13.791
<v Speaker 5>but then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2698
02:30:13.791 --> 02:30:14.624
<v Speaker 5>well some of these practices look like </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not exactly commensurate with </v>

2699
02:30:19.011 --> 02:30:21.360
<v Speaker 5>what we would regard as appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2700
02:30:21.440 --> 02:30:24.260
<v Speaker 5>So we have a problem there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's another problem.</v>

2701
02:30:24.680 --> 02:30:27.920
<v Speaker 5>So as a of the same sort,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm using this as an example just to</v>

2702
02:30:27.921 --> 02:30:30.980
<v Speaker 5>show you how axiomatic systems produce </v>
<v Speaker 5>internal conflicts.</v>

2703
02:30:31.310 --> 02:30:32.600
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2704
02:30:34.760 --> 02:30:35.593
<v Speaker 5>the access to abortion has become </v>
<v Speaker 5>increasingly universal in western </v>

2705
02:30:39.921 --> 02:30:40.754
<v Speaker 5>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although it's backtracked a lot in the </v>

2706
02:30:41.691 --> 02:30:44.420
<v Speaker 5>US over the last 10 years for a variety </v>
<v Speaker 5>of reasons.</v>

2707
02:30:45.020 --> 02:30:47.420
<v Speaker 5>But there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a weird consequence of that.</v>

2708
02:30:48.200 --> 02:30:49.033
<v Speaker 5>And one of the consequences is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>female fetus get aborted at a much </v>

2709
02:30:51.471 --> 02:30:53.450
<v Speaker 5>higher rate than male fetuses worldwide.</v>

2710
02:30:54.080 --> 02:30:55.250
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what do you do about that?</v>

2711
02:30:55.940 --> 02:31:00.230
<v Speaker 5>Like is that acceptable or not?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because if it's not well then,</v>

2712
02:31:00.620 --> 02:31:03.740
<v Speaker 5>then there's a problem because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to face,</v>

2713
02:31:04.040 --> 02:31:06.680
<v Speaker 5>you have to face what do you have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>face?</v>

2714
02:31:06.681 --> 02:31:10.430
<v Speaker 5>Exactly that there is an ethical </v>
<v Speaker 5>question that when it comes to abortion,</v>

2715
02:31:10.880 --> 02:31:13.880
<v Speaker 5>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how if abortion is not wrong,</v>

2716
02:31:13.910 --> 02:31:17.390
<v Speaker 5>how could selective abortion pro </v>
<v Speaker 5>possibly be not wrong.</v>

2717
02:31:18.200 --> 02:31:20.940
<v Speaker 5>Like maybe you could come up with an </v>
<v Speaker 5>explanation for that,</v>

2718
02:31:20.941 --> 02:31:25.110
<v Speaker 5>but I've never seen a credible one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's just a good example of how if</v>

2719
02:31:25.111 --> 02:31:25.944
<v Speaker 5>you use an axiomatic system,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's inevitably the case where the </v>

2720
02:31:29.371 --> 02:31:34.371
<v Speaker 5>axioms collide and it's sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>am I free to offend you with my speech?</v>

2721
02:31:35.700 --> 02:31:37.720
<v Speaker 5>Two axioms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>freedom of speech and,</v>

2722
02:31:37.721 --> 02:31:39.390
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>integrity of person.</v>

2723
02:31:39.480 --> 02:31:42.120
<v Speaker 5>At what point am I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>am I in citing aggression?</v>

2724
02:31:42.840 --> 02:31:43.840
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2725
02:31:44.030 --> 02:31:45.450
<v Speaker 5>and it's also the case,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

2726
02:31:45.451 --> 02:31:46.480
<v Speaker 5>where the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why the horace.</v>

2727
02:31:46.480 --> 02:31:49.950
<v Speaker 5>So Cyrus thing is absolutely necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you can take a vote,</v>

2728
02:31:49.951 --> 02:31:53.760
<v Speaker 5>cyrus as a set of axiomatic moral </v>
<v Speaker 5>presuppositions,</v>

2729
02:31:53.910 --> 02:31:56.280
<v Speaker 5>like a list of rules like the 10 </v>
<v Speaker 5>Commandments.</v>

2730
02:31:57.180 --> 02:31:59.730
<v Speaker 5>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that not only do the rules get out of</v>

2731
02:31:59.731 --> 02:32:01.530
<v Speaker 5>date over time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2732
02:32:02.100 --> 02:32:02.933
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't worry very much about coveting </v>

2733
02:32:05.011 --> 02:32:07.290
<v Speaker 5>our neighbor's goat for example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2734
02:32:07.291 --> 02:32:09.390
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they become obsolete across time.</v>

2735
02:32:09.391 --> 02:32:10.224
<v Speaker 5>But worse than that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are situations where if you apply </v>

2736
02:32:12.781 --> 02:32:13.890
<v Speaker 5>both,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they conflict.</v>

2737
02:32:14.370 --> 02:32:16.050
<v Speaker 5>So then what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2738
02:32:16.051 --> 02:32:18.710
<v Speaker 5>the answer is you pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2739
02:32:18.711 --> 02:32:21.720
<v Speaker 5>you pay attention because you have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>mediate between the conflict.</v>

2740
02:32:21.960 --> 02:32:22.793
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>horace is also the thing that mediates </v>

2741
02:32:23.731 --> 02:32:24.564
<v Speaker 5>between the conflicts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's partly why in the </v>

2742
02:32:27.271 --> 02:32:28.104
<v Speaker 5>Mesopotamian story you have Marduk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And one of the things that Martech </v>

2743
02:32:31.501 --> 02:32:33.900
<v Speaker 5>demands when he's elevated to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>highest position,</v>

2744
02:32:34.080 --> 02:32:34.651
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2745
02:32:34.651 --> 02:32:36.570
<v Speaker 5>so that makes him ruler of all the gods.</v>

2746
02:32:36.570 --> 02:32:38.580
<v Speaker 5>And you can think about those as,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2747
02:32:38.610 --> 02:32:41.010
<v Speaker 5>integro motivational forces are </v>
<v Speaker 5>principles.</v>

2748
02:32:41.430 --> 02:32:42.263
<v Speaker 5>He gets the tablet of destinies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which means that what he represents is </v>

2749
02:32:45.631 --> 02:32:46.464
<v Speaker 5>the thing that makes the decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's often the decision between </v>

2750
02:32:49.081 --> 02:32:49.914
<v Speaker 5>two rigid approaches to right and wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so you say a chaotic approach to </v>

2751
02:32:55.561 --> 02:32:57.900
<v Speaker 5>right and wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a catastrophe.</v>

2752
02:32:58.710 --> 02:32:59.543
<v Speaker 5>And then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well you replaced that with a system of </v>

2753
02:33:00.931 --> 02:33:03.330
<v Speaker 5>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is better,</v>

2754
02:33:03.360 --> 02:33:05.850
<v Speaker 5>but the system of rules has two </v>
<v Speaker 5>potential problems.</v>

2755
02:33:05.851 --> 02:33:10.590
<v Speaker 5>One is it will age and the other is that</v>
<v Speaker 5>it produces internal conflicts.</v>

2756
02:33:10.980 --> 02:33:11.813
<v Speaker 5>So then you need a third principle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the third principle to me seems to </v>

2757
02:33:14.851 --> 02:33:16.860
<v Speaker 5>be what the Egyptians represented with </v>
<v Speaker 5>horace.</v>

2758
02:33:17.550 --> 02:33:18.383
<v Speaker 5>And then you get into a car,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get into a communicative dialogue </v>

2759
02:33:21.270 --> 02:33:22.103
<v Speaker 5>between the horace factor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is attention and the culture like </v>

2760
02:33:26.150 --> 02:33:26.983
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They mutually inform one another and </v>

2761
02:33:28.141 --> 02:33:33.090
<v Speaker 5>that keeps things structured but also </v>
<v Speaker 5>flexible enough to adapt across time.</v>

2762
02:33:33.480 --> 02:33:36.270
<v Speaker 5>And then the system has to build in </v>
<v Speaker 5>recognition for that.</v>

2763
02:33:36.271 --> 02:33:38.670
<v Speaker 5>And that's where I think the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 5>individual rights comes from.</v>

2764
02:33:39.060 --> 02:33:41.670
<v Speaker 5>It's like you have an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2765
02:33:41.671 --> 02:33:42.504
<v Speaker 5>Because you are a necessary player in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the process that keeps the forces of </v>

2766
02:33:47.280 --> 02:33:48.113
<v Speaker 5>order and chaos balanced across time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you're shutdown or oppressed or </v>

2767
02:33:51.511 --> 02:33:55.800
<v Speaker 5>not allowed to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then the society denies itself,</v>

2768
02:33:55.801 --> 02:33:59.730
<v Speaker 5>that corrected action and the correct of</v>
<v Speaker 5>micro corrections say,</v>

2769
02:33:59.970 --> 02:34:00.803
<v Speaker 5>and then what happens is it gets more </v>
<v Speaker 5>and more and more rigid and more </v>

2770
02:34:02.581 --> 02:34:03.414
<v Speaker 5>tyrannical because people have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>falsify their experience to adhere to </v>

2771
02:34:06.421 --> 02:34:07.254
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the bloody thing collapses </v>

2772
02:34:08.491 --> 02:34:11.100
<v Speaker 5>precipitously.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what happened with the Soviet</v>

2773
02:34:11.100 --> 02:34:11.933
<v Speaker 5>Union.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you either make micro corrections or </v>

2774
02:34:15.721 --> 02:34:17.830
<v Speaker 5>you accumulate error</v>

2775
02:34:18.280 --> 02:34:19.840
<v Speaker 6>and collapsed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think that,</v>

2776
02:34:20.240 --> 02:34:21.910
<v Speaker 6>so when I looked at that </v>
<v Speaker 6>psychologically,</v>

2777
02:34:21.911 --> 02:34:22.744
<v Speaker 6>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think the way that people do that in </v>

2778
02:34:24.581 --> 02:34:25.414
<v Speaker 6>their own life is that they adjust their</v>
<v Speaker 6>own psyches with micro corrections and </v>

2779
02:34:29.741 --> 02:34:30.574
<v Speaker 6>then they communicate about freely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then that's enough to keep the </v>

2780
02:34:34.091 --> 02:34:37.450
<v Speaker 6>society dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you have to let people speak.</v>

2781
02:34:38.320 --> 02:34:40.630
<v Speaker 6>So that's why the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2782
02:34:40.631 --> 02:34:41.464
<v Speaker 6>freedom of speech is a critical </v>
<v Speaker 6>characteristic of modern democratic </v>

2783
02:34:45.011 --> 02:34:45.844
<v Speaker 6>states.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like it doesn't matter what the </v>

2784
02:34:46.841 --> 02:34:48.970
<v Speaker 6>person says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's irrelevant whether they're right or</v>

2785
02:34:48.971 --> 02:34:51.160
<v Speaker 6>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't matter if they're offensive,</v>

2786
02:34:51.370 --> 02:34:53.410
<v Speaker 6>it's not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The point is,</v>

2787
02:34:53.411 --> 02:34:54.244
<v Speaker 6>is that you have to let the chatter </v>
<v Speaker 6>emerge so that you can sort the wheat </v>

2788
02:34:58.361 --> 02:35:00.940
<v Speaker 6>from the chaff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if you suppress it,</v>

2789
02:35:00.941 --> 02:35:03.340
<v Speaker 6>then the error correction mechanism goes</v>
<v Speaker 6>away.</v>

2790
02:35:08.510 --> 02:35:10.580
<v Speaker 3>Let's take the lid off political </v>
<v Speaker 3>correctness.</v>

2791
02:35:12.970 --> 02:35:15.880
<v Speaker 6>There's absolutely no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was looking today,</v>

2792
02:35:16.210 --> 02:35:18.730
<v Speaker 6>they just fired a professor at Marquette</v>
<v Speaker 6>University.</v>

2793
02:35:18.970 --> 02:35:19.481
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2794
02:35:19.481 --> 02:35:22.050
<v Speaker 6>So what</v>
<v Speaker 6>was it,</v>

2795
02:35:22.051 --> 02:35:23.680
<v Speaker 6>mark hat?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a marquette.</v>

2796
02:35:24.230 --> 02:35:25.540
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what this guy did,</v>

2797
02:35:25.541 --> 02:35:27.400
<v Speaker 6>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's a self proclaimed conservative.</v>

2798
02:35:27.401 --> 02:35:30.880
<v Speaker 6>He has a blog and he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

2799
02:35:30.881 --> 02:35:32.050
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2800
02:35:32.051 --> 02:35:32.884
<v Speaker 6>ta was teaching a course where the idea </v>
<v Speaker 6>of gay marriage came up and a student </v>

2801
02:35:36.821 --> 02:35:40.600
<v Speaker 6>approached her afterwards and said that </v>
<v Speaker 6>he had opposed gay marriage and she said</v>

2802
02:35:40.601 --> 02:35:41.434
<v Speaker 6>there wasn't something like there wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 6>going to be any discussion of that in </v>

2803
02:35:43.241 --> 02:35:44.110
<v Speaker 6>her class.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

2804
02:35:44.530 --> 02:35:47.680
<v Speaker 6>and he recorded that and then that was </v>
<v Speaker 6>released.</v>

2805
02:35:47.681 --> 02:35:50.180
<v Speaker 6>And then this character,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2806
02:35:51.100 --> 02:35:53.530
<v Speaker 6>wrote a blog and criticized the graduate</v>
<v Speaker 6>student for,</v>

2807
02:35:53.670 --> 02:35:55.780
<v Speaker 6>for not letting this guy speak.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2808
02:35:55.810 --> 02:35:59.650
<v Speaker 6>So far.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you can read the blog.</v>

2809
02:36:00.070 --> 02:36:03.040
<v Speaker 6>That caused quite a lot of trouble and </v>
<v Speaker 6>eventually he got fired.</v>

2810
02:36:03.220 --> 02:36:04.053
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So fine.</v>

2811
02:36:04.060 --> 02:36:06.670
<v Speaker 6>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I read opinions on both sides.</v>

2812
02:36:06.671 --> 02:36:09.940
<v Speaker 6>You know that the conservative critic </v>
<v Speaker 6>said,</v>

2813
02:36:09.970 --> 02:36:10.803
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is just another case of someone </v>

2814
02:36:11.591 --> 02:36:12.424
<v Speaker 6>being hounded out of his job.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the people on the left said he </v>

2815
02:36:15.701 --> 02:36:19.420
<v Speaker 6>misused his position of authority to go </v>
<v Speaker 6>after this graduate student in public.</v>

2816
02:36:19.421 --> 02:36:20.254
<v Speaker 6>And that wasn't due process.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so it wasn't his opinions that got </v>

2817
02:36:23.081 --> 02:36:26.290
<v Speaker 6>him fired.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was his failure to observe university</v>

2818
02:36:26.291 --> 02:36:27.280
<v Speaker 6>regulations.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So fine,</v>

2819
02:36:27.281 --> 02:36:28.114
<v Speaker 6>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 6>something can be said on both sides of </v>

2820
02:36:29.441 --> 02:36:32.110
<v Speaker 6>the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But then I looked at the comments,</v>

2821
02:36:32.710 --> 02:36:36.340
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>20 to one they were,</v>

2822
02:36:36.430 --> 02:36:39.790
<v Speaker 6>this is why we're voting for trump.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2823
02:36:40.450 --> 02:36:41.283
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I do believe that because trump has </v>

2824
02:36:42.341 --> 02:36:45.910
<v Speaker 6>disagreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that means he'll say anything.</v>

2825
02:36:46.600 --> 02:36:48.310
<v Speaker 6>He'll shoot off his mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he'll say anything.</v>

2826
02:36:48.400 --> 02:36:50.350
<v Speaker 6>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people don't care what he says.</v>

2827
02:36:50.710 --> 02:36:52.810
<v Speaker 6>What they care about is that he'll say </v>
<v Speaker 6>anything.</v>

2828
02:36:53.260 --> 02:36:56.800
<v Speaker 6>That's what they're going after.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they definitely see that as a,</v>

2829
02:36:58.440 --> 02:36:59.273
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a gesture of hostility towards the PC </v>

2830
02:37:02.801 --> 02:37:04.870
<v Speaker 6>left.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They say that.</v>

2831
02:37:06.100 --> 02:37:07.810
<v Speaker 6>So the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is,</v>

2832
02:37:07.811 --> 02:37:09.730
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you,</v>

2833
02:37:11.560 --> 02:37:14.350
<v Speaker 6>extremism always calls the devils out of</v>
<v Speaker 6>the closet.</v>

2834
02:37:14.770 --> 02:37:16.760
<v Speaker 6>So if you move too far to the left in </v>
<v Speaker 6>any way,</v>

2835
02:37:16.761 --> 02:37:17.594
<v Speaker 6>you Carl,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the demons of the right out and vice </v>

2836
02:37:19.491 --> 02:37:21.230
<v Speaker 6>versa.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a psychological principle.</v>

2837
02:37:21.231 --> 02:37:24.020
<v Speaker 6>It happens within people's character.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So</v>

2838
02:37:25.530 --> 02:37:25.980
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2839
02:37:25.980 --> 02:37:26.813
<v Speaker 6>I was privy to a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a line of communication between a bunch </v>

2840
02:37:31.561 --> 02:37:33.450
<v Speaker 6>of people who,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who weren't poor,</v>

2841
02:37:33.720 --> 02:37:35.670
<v Speaker 6>white trash,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so to speak.</v>

2842
02:37:36.300 --> 02:37:37.980
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the stereotypical trump's supporter.</v>

2843
02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:38.833
<v Speaker 6>These people were well ensconced in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>middle and upper middle class and </v>

2844
02:37:41.821 --> 02:37:42.654
<v Speaker 6>virtually,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they were almost all men virtually </v>

2845
02:37:43.981 --> 02:37:46.590
<v Speaker 6>to a man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They said something like,</v>

2846
02:37:46.591 --> 02:37:48.390
<v Speaker 6>the system is so raw and we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>bring it down.</v>

2847
02:37:48.720 --> 02:37:49.553
<v Speaker 6>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 6>really that's what you guys are </v>

2848
02:37:50.941 --> 02:37:54.960
<v Speaker 6>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're that reactively angry.</v>

2849
02:37:55.560 --> 02:38:00.560
<v Speaker 6>And</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2850
02:38:03.311 --> 02:38:08.311
<v Speaker 6>if you're in a marriage shape and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>you refuse to let your partner speak for</v>

2851
02:38:08.620 --> 02:38:09.453
<v Speaker 6>decades,</v>

2852
02:38:10.810 --> 02:38:11.643
<v Speaker 6>you body bit well better be careful with</v>
<v Speaker 6>make decided to speak because you're </v>

2853
02:38:14.591 --> 02:38:15.424
<v Speaker 6>going to come home one day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I used to tell this children's story in </v>

2854
02:38:17.321 --> 02:38:18.154
<v Speaker 6>this class about a guy who there's a </v>
<v Speaker 6>little dragon in the house and it's </v>

2855
02:38:20.861 --> 02:38:23.440
<v Speaker 6>ignored by everyone and it eventually </v>
<v Speaker 6>runs away with the house.</v>

2856
02:38:23.441 --> 02:38:26.140
<v Speaker 6>And so Mr Bixby,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who's the head of the household,</v>

2857
02:38:26.141 --> 02:38:30.640
<v Speaker 6>the guy who's all working comes home and</v>
<v Speaker 6>his house is gone and he's surprised the</v>

2858
02:38:30.641 --> 02:38:32.710
<v Speaker 6>house is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He asked the neighbors where it went.</v>

2859
02:38:32.711 --> 02:38:35.170
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the basic story is something like,</v>

2860
02:38:35.171 --> 02:38:37.600
<v Speaker 6>well there was something not going on so</v>
<v Speaker 6>good in that house.</v>

2861
02:38:37.601 --> 02:38:40.300
<v Speaker 6>And people ignored it and got bigger and</v>
<v Speaker 6>bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.</v>

2862
02:38:40.301 --> 02:38:41.134
<v Speaker 6>It's finally it ran away with his house.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well that happens to people all the </v>

2863
02:38:43.481 --> 02:38:44.314
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They come home and their partner has </v>

2864
02:38:45.401 --> 02:38:47.050
<v Speaker 6>packed up taking the kids and left.</v>

2865
02:38:47.050 --> 02:38:48.610
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't see that coming.</v>

2866
02:38:48.880 --> 02:38:51.560
<v Speaker 6>It's like see is the right word.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2867
02:38:51.570 --> 02:38:54.850
<v Speaker 6>what did you have a million warnings?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Likely,</v>

2868
02:38:55.180 --> 02:38:55.631
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>now,</v>

2869
02:38:55.631 --> 02:38:56.464
<v Speaker 6>now and then someone gets screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're married to someone who's </v>

2870
02:38:57.971 --> 02:39:01.660
<v Speaker 6>psychopathic and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're just doomed from the start.</v>

2871
02:39:02.050 --> 02:39:02.883
<v Speaker 6>But generally it's not that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the accumulation of a million </v>

2872
02:39:05.111 --> 02:39:08.890
<v Speaker 6>unsolved on had arguments and finally it</v>
<v Speaker 6>explodes.</v>

2873
02:39:09.430 --> 02:39:12.130
<v Speaker 6>And that's what happens when you </v>
<v Speaker 6>suppress free speech.</v>

2874
02:39:12.810 --> 02:39:13.643
<v Speaker 6>The the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for the reason you support free speech </v>

2875
02:39:15.911 --> 02:39:19.210
<v Speaker 6>is not because people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not even because it isn't.</v>

2876
02:39:19.211 --> 02:39:22.510
<v Speaker 6>Because people have a right to be heard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That isn't a dig it exactly.</v>

2877
02:39:23.680 --> 02:39:24.513
<v Speaker 6>It's the people have a right to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>stupid and ignorant and you need to </v>

2878
02:39:27.161 --> 02:39:30.850
<v Speaker 6>listen to them because then you know </v>
<v Speaker 6>where the stupid and ignorant people are</v>

2879
02:39:31.030 --> 02:39:33.730
<v Speaker 6>and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can have a discussion with them.</v>

2880
02:39:33.970 --> 02:39:37.030
<v Speaker 6>Instead they feel oppressed and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hi,</v>

2881
02:39:37.390 --> 02:39:40.810
<v Speaker 6>and then that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is not good.</v>

2882
02:39:41.320 --> 02:39:42.400
<v Speaker 6>Because they can say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2883
02:39:42.401 --> 02:39:43.234
<v Speaker 6>we're all pressed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that justifies their stupidity and </v>

2884
02:39:45.701 --> 02:39:47.740
<v Speaker 6>ignorance and it's like they are </v>
<v Speaker 6>oppressed.</v>

2885
02:39:48.160 --> 02:39:50.290
<v Speaker 6>Whether that justifies their stupidity </v>
<v Speaker 6>ignorance,</v>

2886
02:39:50.291 --> 02:39:51.124
<v Speaker 6>it's a whole different question.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you don't stop destructive morons </v>

2887
02:39:55.811 --> 02:39:59.440
<v Speaker 6>from talking ever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because the fact that you don't let them</v>

2888
02:39:59.441 --> 02:40:01.540
<v Speaker 6>talk doesn't mean that what they think </v>
<v Speaker 6>goes away.</v>

2889
02:40:01.690 --> 02:40:03.490
<v Speaker 6>Plus you don't have a chance to confront</v>
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>

2890
02:40:04.390 --> 02:40:05.223
<v Speaker 6>So</v>

2891
02:40:06.480 --> 02:40:11.480
<v Speaker 2>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

2892
02:40:13.110 --> 02:40:13.980
<v Speaker 2>we'll finish up</v>

2893
02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:16.500
<v Speaker 6>on this next week.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But here's the central idea.</v>

2894
02:40:20.250 --> 02:40:23.610
<v Speaker 6>People have an ethical responsibility to</v>
<v Speaker 6>embody horace,</v>

2895
02:40:23.640 --> 02:40:24.473
<v Speaker 6>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because we can take it out of the </v>

2896
02:40:25.531 --> 02:40:26.364
<v Speaker 6>religious context that way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because like none of you guys are </v>

2897
02:40:28.200 --> 02:40:29.910
<v Speaker 6>ancient Egypt worshipers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2898
02:40:29.911 --> 02:40:32.040
<v Speaker 6>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's irrelevant from a,</v>

2899
02:40:32.220 --> 02:40:33.053
<v Speaker 6>from a cultural perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But what the Egyptians carefully laid </v>

2900
02:40:35.491 --> 02:40:40.260
<v Speaker 6>out was the idea that it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's the force that pays attention,</v>

2901
02:40:40.500 --> 02:40:44.970
<v Speaker 6>especially to corruption and evil that </v>
<v Speaker 6>revivified as the state at its own risk.</v>

2902
02:40:44.971 --> 02:40:47.160
<v Speaker 6>Because of course horse loses nine and </v>
<v Speaker 6>the conflict,</v>

2903
02:40:47.161 --> 02:40:47.994
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's never any indication that the z </v>

2904
02:40:49.410 --> 02:40:51.690
<v Speaker 6>easy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you put yourself at risk to do it,</v>

2905
02:40:52.440 --> 02:40:53.273
<v Speaker 6>but the risk you avoid by doing it is </v>
<v Speaker 6>the ultimate degeneration of everything </v>

2906
02:40:56.281 --> 02:40:57.114
<v Speaker 6>into hell.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So there's a risk to be taken to say </v>

2907
02:40:59.821 --> 02:41:02.970
<v Speaker 6>what you think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's a moral obligation.</v>

2908
02:41:02.971 --> 02:41:06.870
<v Speaker 6>And the consequence of not doing it is </v>
<v Speaker 6>that the system deteriorates into hell.</v>

2909
02:41:07.050 --> 02:41:07.831
<v Speaker 6>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2910
02:41:07.831 --> 02:41:11.640
<v Speaker 6>is that prove it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay fine,</v>

2911
02:41:11.700 --> 02:41:12.533
<v Speaker 6>it's approved.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what happened in the communist </v>

2912
02:41:13.891 --> 02:41:15.720
<v Speaker 6>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the documentation is,</v>

2913
02:41:16.080 --> 02:41:16.913
<v Speaker 6>it's so clear that the formal rat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there are many who are form were former </v>

2914
02:41:21.990 --> 02:41:22.823
<v Speaker 6>Lee radical lefties and communists in </v>
<v Speaker 6>France who have written a book saying </v>

2915
02:41:28.021 --> 02:41:28.854
<v Speaker 6>that it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you know when you completely convert </v>

2916
02:41:31.890 --> 02:41:34.380
<v Speaker 6>reconvert the converted,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to think,</v>

2917
02:41:34.381 --> 02:41:35.214
<v Speaker 6>well maybe there's some power to that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And Social Net since basic point </v>

2918
02:41:37.561 --> 02:41:41.230
<v Speaker 6>continually was there's no way the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Soviet system could,</v>

2919
02:41:41.231 --> 02:41:42.064
<v Speaker 6>it kept its talons in people if they </v>
<v Speaker 6>would've refused to lie and the lies </v>

2920
02:41:45.031 --> 02:41:48.540
<v Speaker 6>were always,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'll face this in the workplace,</v>

2921
02:41:48.541 --> 02:41:49.374
<v Speaker 6>you wait and see it's going to come.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because what'll happen is someone will </v>

2922
02:41:52.051 --> 02:41:54.450
<v Speaker 6>come and there'll be a bit of a bully </v>
<v Speaker 6>and they'll come to you and they'll say,</v>

2923
02:41:54.660 --> 02:41:56.850
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how about if you do this work and you'll</v>

2924
02:41:56.851 --> 02:41:58.410
<v Speaker 6>think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey renee,</v>

2925
02:41:58.411 --> 02:42:01.590
<v Speaker 6>that's your work and it's not kosher </v>
<v Speaker 6>that you're giving it to me,</v>

2926
02:42:01.680 --> 02:42:02.700
<v Speaker 6>but you won't say anything.</v>

2927
02:42:02.700 --> 02:42:03.690
<v Speaker 6>You'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

2928
02:42:03.720 --> 02:42:04.471
<v Speaker 6>because you'll think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2929
02:42:04.471 --> 02:42:06.240
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to cause any trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

2930
02:42:06.570 --> 02:42:07.530
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no problem,</v>

2931
02:42:07.710 --> 02:42:09.660
<v Speaker 6>but the next time that we're comes your </v>
<v Speaker 6>way,</v>

2932
02:42:09.690 --> 02:42:10.523
<v Speaker 6>you can just remember that you </v>
<v Speaker 6>facilitated that process because you </v>

2933
02:42:12.541 --> 02:42:13.374
<v Speaker 6>didn't say anything to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And when you get your 10000th piece of </v>

2934
02:42:16.081 --> 02:42:18.660
<v Speaker 6>work and you're crushed right over and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you think,</v>

2935
02:42:18.661 --> 02:42:19.494
<v Speaker 6>why is the system so damn corrupt?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You might remember that you opened the </v>

2936
02:42:23.221 --> 02:42:27.220
<v Speaker 6>door this much with your first response </v>
<v Speaker 6>and people do that all the time and it's</v>

2937
02:42:27.221 --> 02:42:28.054
<v Speaker 6>a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a minor falsification of their </v>

2938
02:42:29.431 --> 02:42:32.190
<v Speaker 6>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And one of the things I've learned about</v>

2939
02:42:32.191 --> 02:42:33.024
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you can think about this as a good </v>

2940
02:42:34.081 --> 02:42:37.500
<v Speaker 6>guide.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you're resentful about something,</v>

2941
02:42:38.940 --> 02:42:42.330
<v Speaker 6>you're either immature or you have </v>
<v Speaker 6>something to say.</v>

2942
02:42:43.080 --> 02:42:44.790
<v Speaker 6>If you're immature,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well then you should grow up,</v>

2943
02:42:44.820 --> 02:42:47.310
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But if you have something to say,</v>

2944
02:42:48.240 --> 02:42:49.073
<v Speaker 6>you should say it because the pathology </v>
<v Speaker 6>of the system has manifested itself </v>

2945
02:42:53.671 --> 02:42:55.380
<v Speaker 6>within the domain of your experience.</v>

2946
02:42:55.380 --> 02:42:58.500
<v Speaker 6>It's right there in front of you and </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's only gone,</v>

2947
02:42:59.130 --> 02:43:02.070
<v Speaker 6>it's only tilted just this micro tilt,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2948
02:43:02.080 --> 02:43:04.110
<v Speaker 6>off kilter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you might think,</v>

2949
02:43:04.111 --> 02:43:04.944
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not going to make a fuss out of </v>

2950
02:43:05.740 --> 02:43:07.740
<v Speaker 6>because of other that because it's so </v>
<v Speaker 6>little.</v>

2951
02:43:07.890 --> 02:43:12.700
<v Speaker 6>It's like there's a book called ordinary</v>
<v Speaker 6>Germans,</v>

2952
02:43:13.270 --> 02:43:14.320
<v Speaker 6>ordinary man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sorry.</v>

2953
02:43:14.410 --> 02:43:15.243
<v Speaker 6>It's a famous book and it's a story </v>
<v Speaker 6>about this troupe of German policemen </v>

2954
02:43:20.020 --> 02:43:20.853
<v Speaker 6>who are taken to Poland once the Germans</v>
<v Speaker 6>had marched through and they were </v>

2955
02:43:23.480 --> 02:43:26.800
<v Speaker 6>birdwalk guys all race before Hitler </v>
<v Speaker 6>came to power.</v>

2956
02:43:27.070 --> 02:43:27.903
<v Speaker 6>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think you could just think about them </v>

2957
02:43:29.381 --> 02:43:32.080
<v Speaker 6>as middleclass suburbanites that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>basically who they were.</v>

2958
02:43:32.230 --> 02:43:34.170
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>average gums.</v>

2959
02:43:34.960 --> 02:43:38.680
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Banded up by taking naked women out into</v>

2960
02:43:38.681 --> 02:43:41.380
<v Speaker 6>the field who are pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 6>shooting them in the back of the head.</v>

2961
02:43:41.950 --> 02:43:42.970
<v Speaker 6>And so you think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

2962
02:43:42.971 --> 02:43:43.804
<v Speaker 6>how does that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the answer is one tiny little step </v>

2963
02:43:46.901 --> 02:43:47.710
<v Speaker 6>at a time.</v>

2964
02:43:47.710 --> 02:43:48.543
<v Speaker 6>And this is well documented in the book </v>
<v Speaker 6>because the guy who wrote the book was </v>

2965
02:43:51.941 --> 02:43:52.631
<v Speaker 6>curious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

2966
02:43:52.631 --> 02:43:56.320
<v Speaker 6>well how do you take ordinary people who</v>
<v Speaker 6>in principle are no worse or better than</v>

2967
02:43:56.321 --> 02:43:59.770
<v Speaker 6>anyone else and get them to commit </v>
<v Speaker 6>unbearable atrocities.</v>

2968
02:43:59.980 --> 02:44:03.430
<v Speaker 6>And then he walks you through it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like they're asked to do x.</v>

2969
02:44:03.431 --> 02:44:04.240
<v Speaker 6>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

2970
02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:06.610
<v Speaker 6>And then they're asked to do x plus one </v>
<v Speaker 6>and they say,</v>

2971
02:44:06.611 --> 02:44:08.530
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they were asked to do x plus two and</v>

2972
02:44:08.531 --> 02:44:09.364
<v Speaker 6>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

2973
02:44:09.490 --> 02:44:10.323
<v Speaker 6>And by the time they're an x plus a </v>
<v Speaker 6>hundred things are looking pretty </v>

2974
02:44:13.151 --> 02:44:15.310
<v Speaker 6>dismal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's getting hard to step back,</v>

2975
02:44:15.490 --> 02:44:16.323
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then then the descent instead of </v>

2976
02:44:18.401 --> 02:44:19.960
<v Speaker 6>being like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this goes like this,</v>

2977
02:44:20.020 --> 02:44:22.480
<v Speaker 6>and there's no bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's absolutely no bottom.</v>

2978
02:44:23.440 --> 02:44:25.390
<v Speaker 6>And so the trick is to nip it in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>bud.</v>

2979
02:44:25.420 --> 02:44:28.300
<v Speaker 6>And the way you do that is by being </v>
<v Speaker 6>very,</v>

2980
02:44:28.301 --> 02:44:29.134
<v Speaker 6>very careful about what you say.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then when something is not going </v>

2981
02:44:31.451 --> 02:44:32.284
<v Speaker 6>right and you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to say something and you might </v>

2982
02:44:35.231 --> 02:44:36.520
<v Speaker 6>say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well maybe I'll get fired.</v>

2983
02:44:37.090 --> 02:44:37.923
<v Speaker 6>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how the hell do you know that's not the </v>

2984
02:44:39.191 --> 02:44:41.620
<v Speaker 6>best thing that could happen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

2985
02:44:41.621 --> 02:44:44.620
<v Speaker 6>Cause if you're in a system that will </v>
<v Speaker 6>not take your feedback when you're being</v>

2986
02:44:44.621 --> 02:44:45.454
<v Speaker 6>reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then you're in a nascent tyranny and it </v>

2987
02:44:47.651 --> 02:44:48.484
<v Speaker 6>could be easily the best thing that ever</v>
<v Speaker 6>happened to you to get out of there </v>

2988
02:44:50.531 --> 02:44:52.030
<v Speaker 6>before you're crushed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Completely.</v>

2989
02:44:52.570 --> 02:44:53.403
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

2990
02:44:55.860 --> 02:44:56.520
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2991
02:44:56.520 --> 02:44:57.353
<v Speaker 6>the most sophisticated political </v>
<v Speaker 6>philosophers of the 20th century in my </v>

2992
02:45:00.031 --> 02:45:00.864
<v Speaker 6>estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>came to the conclusion that the reason </v>

2993
02:45:02.371 --> 02:45:05.730
<v Speaker 6>that horrific genocidal crimes take </v>
<v Speaker 6>places because ordinary people lie.</v>

2994
02:45:07.410 --> 02:45:11.100
<v Speaker 6>And that's a radical conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But</v>

2995
02:45:12.750 --> 02:45:14.850
<v Speaker 6>a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how could it be any different?</v>

2996
02:45:15.750 --> 02:45:17.910
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if people start,</v>

2997
02:45:18.870 --> 02:45:23.700
<v Speaker 6>if people let the system deteriorate by </v>
<v Speaker 6>not opposing it when it does,</v>

2998
02:45:25.170 --> 02:45:27.030
<v Speaker 6>how could things end up being different </v>
<v Speaker 6>than that?</v>

2999
02:45:31.490 --> 02:45:32.590
<v Speaker 6>Then I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

3000
02:45:33.370 --> 02:45:36.320
<v Speaker 6>that maps perfectly onto classical </v>
<v Speaker 6>religious ideas.</v>

3001
02:45:36.321 --> 02:45:37.360
<v Speaker 6>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we could say,</v>

3002
02:45:37.420 --> 02:45:38.950
<v Speaker 6>talk about horace and we could talk </v>
<v Speaker 6>about,</v>

3003
02:45:38.990 --> 02:45:40.540
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a martyr.</v>

3004
02:45:41.140 --> 02:45:44.710
<v Speaker 6>But the idea of logos that's underlying </v>
<v Speaker 6>Christianity is exactly the same thing.</v>

3005
02:45:44.711 --> 02:45:47.590
<v Speaker 6>Because what logos basically means is </v>
<v Speaker 6>truthful communication.</v>

3006
02:45:47.770 --> 02:45:48.603
<v Speaker 6>That's what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's the thing that in the Judeo </v>

3007
02:45:51.790 --> 02:45:52.623
<v Speaker 6>Christian tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 6>identify as people with the part of God </v>

3008
02:45:55.421 --> 02:45:57.890
<v Speaker 6>that creates order out of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

3009
02:45:58.350 --> 02:46:01.480
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's laid out clearly in the theology.</v>

3010
02:46:01.720 --> 02:46:03.580
<v Speaker 6>And the other part that goes along with </v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

3011
02:46:03.581 --> 02:46:07.390
<v Speaker 6>and this is where the story,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because the story rolls to a conclusion,</v>

3012
02:46:07.660 --> 02:46:09.890
<v Speaker 6>is that if you manifest</v>

3013
02:46:10.010 --> 02:46:13.610
<v Speaker 5>the logos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you end up being crucified and reborn.</v>

3014
02:46:14.060 --> 02:46:14.893
<v Speaker 5>But in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that can happen in small enough way so </v>

3015
02:46:18.561 --> 02:46:21.350
<v Speaker 5>that it doesn't actually have to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3016
02:46:21.351 --> 02:46:22.880
<v Speaker 5>because if you learn something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3017
02:46:22.930 --> 02:46:24.950
<v Speaker 5>if something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if something's bothering you,</v>

3018
02:46:25.520 --> 02:46:27.170
<v Speaker 5>it's bothering you need to take it </v>
<v Speaker 5>through.</v>

3019
02:46:27.620 --> 02:46:28.453
<v Speaker 5>What inevitably happens is that as you </v>
<v Speaker 5>think it through and incorporate the </v>

3020
02:46:31.041 --> 02:46:34.940
<v Speaker 5>information,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all presuppositions are forced to die.</v>

3021
02:46:35.090 --> 02:46:35.923
<v Speaker 5>And that's painful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hard on people because you have to </v>

3022
02:46:37.401 --> 02:46:39.870
<v Speaker 5>reexamine your principles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3023
02:46:39.871 --> 02:46:44.030
<v Speaker 5>at a high resolution level or a broad </v>
<v Speaker 5>level part of you is going to die,</v>

3024
02:46:44.031 --> 02:46:44.864
<v Speaker 5>especially if you need a radical change.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But maybe if you let the part die and </v>

3025
02:46:48.411 --> 02:46:51.440
<v Speaker 5>revivified,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then the whole doesn't have to die.</v>

3026
02:46:51.800 --> 02:46:52.633
<v Speaker 5>And I think that that scale,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like it works within the </v>

3027
02:46:55.311 --> 02:46:56.144
<v Speaker 5>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it also works within the </v>

3028
02:46:59.240 --> 02:47:01.820
<v Speaker 5>personalities organized into a </v>
<v Speaker 5>hierarchical state.</v>

3029
02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:02.833
<v Speaker 5>If you don't allow that</v>
<v Speaker 5>death and resurrection process to occur </v>

3030
02:47:08.060 --> 02:47:08.893
<v Speaker 5>and you suppress it enough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole state has to die and then you </v>

3031
02:47:12.531 --> 02:47:13.364
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the probability that that's going to </v>

3032
02:47:14.211 --> 02:47:16.520
<v Speaker 5>take everyone with it is very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very high.</v>

3033
02:47:17.060 --> 02:47:19.220
<v Speaker 5>So that seems like a bad long term </v>
<v Speaker 5>outcome.</v>

3034
02:47:20.390 --> 02:47:21.223
<v Speaker 4>Well.</v>
