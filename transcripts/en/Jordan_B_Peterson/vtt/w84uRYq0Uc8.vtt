1
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.160
<v Speaker 1>So I want to tell you about a book </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

2
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.770
<v Speaker 1>The book is called the Gulag </v>
<v Speaker 1>Archipelago.</v>

3
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.980
<v Speaker 1>We ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The book is called the Gulag Archipelago</v>

4
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.053
<v Speaker 1>and it's by a Russian author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet author named Alexandra Soldier </v>

5
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:30.663
<v Speaker 1>Nixon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was in the Gulag archipelago </v>

6
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.810
<v Speaker 1>concentration camp system for a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

7
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.700
<v Speaker 1>He had a very hard life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was on the</v>

8
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.603
<v Speaker 1>Russian front when the Germans invaded </v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union in the early stages of </v>

9
00:00:51.011 --> 00:00:51.844
<v Speaker 1>World War II.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Hitler and Stalin had signed a </v>

10
00:00:54.791 --> 00:00:57.020
<v Speaker 1>nonaggression pact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.260
<v Speaker 1>and Hitler invaded the Soviet Union </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

12
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>And from what I've been able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>

13
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.340
<v Speaker 1>the Soviets had prepared an invasion </v>
<v Speaker 1>force for Europe at that point,</v>

14
00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:14.850
<v Speaker 1>but we're not concerned with having to </v>
<v Speaker 1>defend their territory.</v>

15
00:01:14.851 --> 00:01:17.970
<v Speaker 1>And so they were caught completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>unawares by Hitler's move.</v>

16
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.500
<v Speaker 1>And the conditions on the Russian front </v>
<v Speaker 1>were absolutely dreadful.</v>

17
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.190
<v Speaker 1>And Soldier Nixon was a soldier on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian front,</v>

18
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:27.743
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

19
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.270
<v Speaker 1>he wrote some letters to one of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

20
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.063
<v Speaker 1>which were intercepted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>complaining about the lack of </v>

21
00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:38.274
<v Speaker 1>preparation and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and using bitter dark humor to describe </v>

22
00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:44.370
<v Speaker 1>the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

23
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.710
<v Speaker 1>the consequences of that was that he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>thrown into a work camp.</v>

24
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.113
<v Speaker 1>The Soviet system relied on work camps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those were large labor camps of </v>

25
00:01:56.581 --> 00:02:00.510
<v Speaker 1>people who were essentially enslaved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of whom were worked to death,</v>

26
00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:01.344
<v Speaker 1>often froze to death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working in conditions that were so </v>

27
00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:06.150
<v Speaker 1>dreadful that they're virtually </v>
<v Speaker 1>unimaginable.</v>

28
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.490
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn spent a very large number </v>
<v Speaker 1>of years in these camps,</v>

29
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.533
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes in a more privileged camp </v>

30
00:02:14.491 --> 00:02:17.370
<v Speaker 1>because he was an educated man and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes in worst camps.</v>

31
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.710
<v Speaker 1>He also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.570
<v Speaker 1>developed cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.680
<v Speaker 1>later and wrote a book about that called</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cancer Ward,</v>

34
00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:31.130
<v Speaker 1>which is a brilliant book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

35
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.430
<v Speaker 1>so he had a very hard life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just no way around that to be on</v>

36
00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:36.264
<v Speaker 1>the front and then to be in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration camp and then to have </v>

37
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:39.350
<v Speaker 1>cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

38
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.590
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he wrote the Gulag archipelago.</v>

39
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.083
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a book called one day in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>life of Ivan Denisovich first that was </v>

40
00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:53.210
<v Speaker 1>published in the early 1960s when there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a brief thought.</v>

41
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.940
<v Speaker 1>Stalin was pretty much out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>

42
00:02:55.941 --> 00:02:56.774
<v Speaker 1>By the end of the 1950s.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some indication that he was </v>

43
00:02:58.551 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>murdered by</v>

44
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.143
<v Speaker 2>Khrushchev.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ana Khrushchev became premier of the </v>

45
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 2>Soviet Union afters stolen and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>some indication perhaps that stellan was</v>

46
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:11.764
<v Speaker 2>either murdered by Khrushchev and a set </v>
<v Speaker 2>of his cronies or when he was very ill </v>

47
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 2>just before he died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was not helped at least by,</v>

48
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Speaker 2>wasn't provided with any medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention because of the intervention of</v>

49
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:25.834
<v Speaker 2>cruise and his cronies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there's some indication as well at </v>

50
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:29.284
<v Speaker 2>that point that Stalin who was an </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute absolutely barbaric in every </v>

51
00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:33.934
<v Speaker 2>possible way you could imagine was </v>
<v Speaker 2>planning to start a third World War and </v>

52
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 2>he was certainly capable of doing such </v>
<v Speaker 2>things because he had already imprisoned</v>

53
00:03:43.811 --> 00:03:48.811
<v Speaker 2>or killed tens of millions of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now just after Stalin died,</v>

54
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:51.904
<v Speaker 2>there was a bit of a thought in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Soviet Union with regards to internal </v>

55
00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:54.814
<v Speaker 2>repression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the early 1960s Solzhenitsyn </v>

56
00:03:57.191 --> 00:04:00.130
<v Speaker 2>published a book called one day in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>life of Ivan Denisovich,</v>

57
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.590
<v Speaker 2>which was a story about one day in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

58
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.570
<v Speaker 2>his life really inside one of these so </v>
<v Speaker 2>called Gulag archipelago camps.</v>

59
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:08.403
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he called it the Gulag archipelago </v>

60
00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:11.740
<v Speaker 2>because an archipelago is a chain of </v>
<v Speaker 2>islands.</v>

61
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.900
<v Speaker 2>And so soldier knits enlightened the </v>
<v Speaker 2>work camp system in the Soviet Union,</v>

62
00:04:16.901 --> 00:04:20.920
<v Speaker 2>which was made up of isolated camps </v>
<v Speaker 2>distributed across the entire state.</v>

63
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.100
<v Speaker 2>He likened that to a series of islands </v>
<v Speaker 2>and enhance,</v>

64
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.963
<v Speaker 2>hence the metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one day in the life of Ivan </v>

65
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.413
<v Speaker 2>Denisovich was one of the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>publications released in the Soviet </v>

66
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.850
<v Speaker 2>Union that dared make public what had </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened inside these camps,</v>

67
00:04:36.221 --> 00:04:39.640
<v Speaker 2>at least initially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that thought didn't last very long,</v>

68
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:42.820
<v Speaker 2>but that book had a tremendous effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a short book.</v>

69
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.560
<v Speaker 2>It's worth reading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

70
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.310
<v Speaker 2>after that he spent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote a number of other books,</v>

71
00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:51.430
<v Speaker 2>which are also great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a great literary figure in the same</v>

72
00:04:51.431 --> 00:04:53.680
<v Speaker 2>category,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say as tolstoy or Dostoevsky,</v>

73
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.900
<v Speaker 2>which is like really saying something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

74
00:04:55.901 --> 00:04:56.734
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those two are perhaps the greatest </v>

75
00:04:57.761 --> 00:05:01.300
<v Speaker 2>literary figures who ever lived with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible exception of Shakespeare.</v>

76
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.473
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote this book called the Gulag </v>

77
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.210
<v Speaker 2>Archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is published in three volumes,</v>

78
00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:10.450
<v Speaker 2>each of which has about 700 pages long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

79
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.130
<v Speaker 2>the first one details the origin of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>oppressive Soviet system,</v>

80
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.353
<v Speaker 2>at least in part under Lenin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's full fledged </v>

81
00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:22.590
<v Speaker 2>implementation under Stalin and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>deaths of while Sojun.</v>

82
00:05:22.591 --> 00:05:23.424
<v Speaker 2>It's an estimated the deaths in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in internal repression in the Soviet </v>

83
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.060
<v Speaker 2>Union at something approximating 60 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million between 1919 in 1959.</v>

84
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.260
<v Speaker 2>Now that doesn't count the death toll in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second world war by the way.</v>

85
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Now people have disputed those figures </v>
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>

86
00:05:37.841 --> 00:05:38.674
<v Speaker 2>but there are certainly in the tens of </v>
<v Speaker 2>millions and the low end bounds are </v>

87
00:05:41.321 --> 00:05:42.154
<v Speaker 2>probably 20 million and the high end </v>
<v Speaker 2>bounds or nearer what sole sole </v>

88
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.053
<v Speaker 2>Jeanette's an estimated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He also estimated that the same kind of </v>

89
00:05:47.921 --> 00:05:52.210
<v Speaker 2>internal repression in Maoist China cost</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 million lives.</v>

90
00:05:52.211 --> 00:05:55.990
<v Speaker 2>And so you can imagine that the genuine </v>
<v Speaker 2>historical figures,</v>

91
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.363
<v Speaker 2>again are to dispute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but somewhere between 50 and a hundred </v>

92
00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:00.650
<v Speaker 2>million people.</v>

93
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:01.483
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>surprising to me and that that I think </v>

94
00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:07.730
<v Speaker 2>is absolutely reprehensible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely reprehensible,</v>

95
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.200
<v Speaker 2>is the fact that this is not widespread </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge among students in the West.</v>

96
00:06:12.201 --> 00:06:14.300
<v Speaker 2>Any of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's because your education,</v>

97
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.433
<v Speaker 2>your historical education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you started to describe it as </v>

98
00:06:17.631 --> 00:06:19.850
<v Speaker 2>appalling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would barely scratched the surface.</v>

99
00:06:19.851 --> 00:06:20.684
<v Speaker 2>These were the most important events of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the 20th century and they're barely </v>

100
00:06:23.481 --> 00:06:26.780
<v Speaker 2>covered at all in standard historical </v>
<v Speaker 2>curriculum.</v>

101
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.853
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something I would presume about World </v>

102
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:31.663
<v Speaker 2>War II and about the terrible situation </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Nazi Germany and the death of 6 </v>

103
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:35.323
<v Speaker 2>million Gypsies and Jews and homosexuals</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the concentration camps in Nazi </v>

104
00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:42.110
<v Speaker 2>Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my experience with students has been</v>

105
00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:42.944
<v Speaker 2>that none of them know anything about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened as a consequence of the </v>

106
00:06:46.191 --> 00:06:48.590
<v Speaker 2>repression of the radical left in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>20th century.</v>

107
00:06:48.591 --> 00:06:49.424
<v Speaker 2>And I believe the reason for that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the communist system had extensive </v>

108
00:06:54.951 --> 00:06:59.450
<v Speaker 2>networks of admirers in the west,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially among intellectuals and still</v>

109
00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:02.030
<v Speaker 2>in fact does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also equally reprehensible.</v>

110
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:03.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I believe the,</v>

111
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:04.893
<v Speaker 2>that one of the consequences of that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that this element of history has been </v>

112
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:10.830
<v Speaker 2>under,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

113
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:11.743
<v Speaker 2>under,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you say under examined and </v>

114
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:15.703
<v Speaker 2>certainly very little attention has been</v>
<v Speaker 2>brought to it in a public school </v>

115
00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:19.274
<v Speaker 2>curricula.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's absolutely no excuse for </v>

116
00:07:21.021 --> 00:07:21.854
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the worst thing that happened in </v>

117
00:07:23.031 --> 00:07:23.864
<v Speaker 2>the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really saying something </v>

118
00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:27.710
<v Speaker 2>because the 20th century was about as </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad as it gets.</v>

119
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.440
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that these,</v>

120
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:31.274
<v Speaker 2>these massive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these deaths on massive scale occurred </v>

121
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.560
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that we don't know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>deep inside our bones is,</v>

122
00:07:37.561 --> 00:07:38.394
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a testament to the absolute rot of </v>

123
00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:44.210
<v Speaker 2>the education system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now you might think this is a strange</v>

124
00:07:44.211 --> 00:07:46.730
<v Speaker 2>thing to discuss in a personality </v>
<v Speaker 2>course,</v>

125
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:48.920
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have my reasons for doing it.</v>

126
00:07:48.921 --> 00:07:49.754
<v Speaker 2>That the fundamental reason is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Solzhenitsyn you might regard as an </v>

127
00:07:53.061 --> 00:07:54.020
<v Speaker 2>existentialist.</v>

128
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.860
<v Speaker 2>Now he says many of this things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same things that Viktor Frankl says.</v>

129
00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.590
<v Speaker 2>Viktor Frankl wrote a book called Man's </v>
<v Speaker 2>search for meaning,</v>

130
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.220
<v Speaker 2>which I would highly recommend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

131
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.273
<v Speaker 2>and it's a description of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the corruption that he saw leading </v>

132
00:08:07.581 --> 00:08:10.310
<v Speaker 2>into the horrors of the Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentration camp systems,</v>

133
00:08:10.311 --> 00:08:12.590
<v Speaker 2>especially within the concentration </v>
<v Speaker 2>camps itself.</v>

134
00:08:12.591 --> 00:08:13.424
<v Speaker 2>Because Frankl was very interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>what sort of psychological catastrophe </v>

135
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.823
<v Speaker 2>had to be fall a given individual before</v>
<v Speaker 2>that person was capable of acting as an </v>

136
00:08:23.571 --> 00:08:24.404
<v Speaker 2>agent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say of the Nazis in the concentration </v>

137
00:08:25.911 --> 00:08:26.744
<v Speaker 2>camp system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he concentrated particularly on </v>

138
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:29.983
<v Speaker 2>these people he called that were known </v>
<v Speaker 2>as trustees within the concentration </v>

139
00:08:33.891 --> 00:08:34.724
<v Speaker 2>camp system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who were generally Jewish individuals </v>

140
00:08:36.831 --> 00:08:40.730
<v Speaker 2>who are aiding the Nazis in their death </v>
<v Speaker 2>work inside the camps.</v>

141
00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:42.290
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what Frankl did,</v>

142
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.290
<v Speaker 2>because he was also existentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>oriented,</v>

143
00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:46.124
<v Speaker 2>was attempt to draw a parallel between </v>
<v Speaker 2>the individual psychology and the mass </v>

144
00:08:50.181 --> 00:08:51.890
<v Speaker 2>pathologies of the state.</v>

145
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:56.610
<v Speaker 2>And so the reason that I believe that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is important in a personality class</v>

146
00:08:56.611 --> 00:08:57.444
<v Speaker 2>is because it's necessary to analyze the</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between the psychological </v>

147
00:09:02.581 --> 00:09:03.414
<v Speaker 2>integrity of the individuals with is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>within a society and the propensity of </v>

148
00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:08.304
<v Speaker 2>that society to engage in say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>acts of mass atrocity or to go to go </v>

149
00:09:12.631 --> 00:09:16.020
<v Speaker 2>completely off the rails and then to </v>
<v Speaker 2>engage in acts of mass atrocity.</v>

150
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:21.000
<v Speaker 2>And so it was Frankel's contention and </v>
<v Speaker 2>also soldier Knutson's contention.</v>

151
00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:21.834
<v Speaker 2>And I would say also the contention of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vaclav Havel who eventually who was an </v>

152
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.410
<v Speaker 2>author and playwright in Czechoslovakia </v>
<v Speaker 2>and eventually became president,</v>

153
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.100
<v Speaker 2>that the fundamental linkage between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>pathology and the state,</v>

154
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:33.653
<v Speaker 2>the pathology of the state and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual was the individual's </v>

155
00:09:36.001 --> 00:09:40.040
<v Speaker 2>propensity to deceive him or herself and</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

156
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.430
<v Speaker 2>so to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fail.</v>

157
00:09:41.431 --> 00:09:42.264
<v Speaker 2>To Act in an authentic manner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a genuine and authentic matter </v>

158
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.313
<v Speaker 2>manner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to become as a consequence either </v>

159
00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:49.470
<v Speaker 2>nihilistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

160
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.633
<v Speaker 2>or because because of the incremental </v>
<v Speaker 2>weakening of character that's part and </v>

161
00:09:55.021 --> 00:09:55.854
<v Speaker 2>parcel of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of adopting an inauthentic motive being </v>

162
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:04.590
<v Speaker 2>or to turn to ideological and </v>
<v Speaker 2>totalitarian solutions as an alternative</v>

163
00:10:04.591 --> 00:10:09.180
<v Speaker 2>to living appropriately and with </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility as an individual.</v>

164
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:14.180
<v Speaker 2>So soldier Nixon in particular laid at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the feet of the Soviet citizenry,</v>

165
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:20.450
<v Speaker 2>the burden of the absolute catastrophes </v>
<v Speaker 2>that characterize that system because of</v>

166
00:10:21.001 --> 00:10:21.834
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the each individual's </v>

167
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:25.733
<v Speaker 2>propensity or proclivity within the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state to lie and deceive constantly </v>

168
00:10:29.101 --> 00:10:31.170
<v Speaker 2>about what they thought and what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>said.</v>

169
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.273
<v Speaker 2>And to be afraid to speak and to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid to think and to be afraid to </v>

170
00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:35.934
<v Speaker 2>criticize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was no wonder because criticism </v>

171
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.320
<v Speaker 2>of course was at least at at least </v>
<v Speaker 2>became an offense that was punishable by</v>

172
00:10:43.321 --> 00:10:44.154
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But these things start much more slowly </v>

173
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:47.423
<v Speaker 2>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they start with people abandoning </v>

174
00:10:49.051 --> 00:10:49.884
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their own identities and adopting a </v>

175
00:10:52.321 --> 00:10:55.620
<v Speaker 2>pathological group identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well for it,</v>

176
00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:56.454
<v Speaker 2>for any number of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one of them certainly is their </v>

177
00:10:58.711 --> 00:10:59.544
<v Speaker 2>desire to shrink for from individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility and their desire for </v>

178
00:11:02.791 --> 00:11:05.970
<v Speaker 2>ready made ideological solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm going,</v>

179
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.850
<v Speaker 2>what I'm going to do today is I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to read you a little bit about the Gulag</v>

180
00:11:08.851 --> 00:11:09.684
<v Speaker 2>archipelago and then I'm going to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>show you a sequence of videos about a </v>

181
00:11:13.561 --> 00:11:14.394
<v Speaker 2>recent event that I think does a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>good job of illustrating how this sort </v>

182
00:11:17.011 --> 00:11:17.844
<v Speaker 2>of thing works.</v>

183
00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.090
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm going to read you some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

184
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.313
<v Speaker 2>some of what I've code from the Gulag </v>
<v Speaker 2>archipelago so that you get a sense of </v>

185
00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:28.750
<v Speaker 2>what the writing is like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So soldier knits and basically he,</v>

186
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:31.770
<v Speaker 2>he committed a huge part of the Gulag </v>
<v Speaker 2>archipelago to memory,</v>

187
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:36.450
<v Speaker 2>which is really something given that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 2100 pages long and printed in like</v>

188
00:11:36.451 --> 00:11:37.284
<v Speaker 2>seven point font and the book is written</v>
<v Speaker 2>at an unbelievable level of emotional </v>

189
00:11:41.611 --> 00:11:42.540
<v Speaker 2>intensity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

190
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:43.763
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember there was a study once about </v>

191
00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:49.450
<v Speaker 2>how rats respond to cats free living </v>
<v Speaker 2>routes in,</v>

192
00:11:49.451 --> 00:11:50.284
<v Speaker 2>in their burrows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they're exposed to a cat or even to </v>

193
00:11:52.291 --> 00:11:53.124
<v Speaker 2>cat odor will run back to their burrow </v>
<v Speaker 2>and stick their nose out and scream for </v>

194
00:11:58.811 --> 00:12:00.580
<v Speaker 2>48 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

195
00:12:00.581 --> 00:12:01.414
<v Speaker 2>Which is about the equivalent of you </v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming for three months because rats </v>

196
00:12:04.301 --> 00:12:06.340
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we live about two years and well,</v>

197
00:12:06.341 --> 00:12:07.390
<v Speaker 2>that rat is screaming.</v>

198
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:11.860
<v Speaker 2>All the other rats stay in their burrow </v>
<v Speaker 2>and don't go anywhere and so they scream</v>

199
00:12:11.861 --> 00:12:12.694
<v Speaker 2>ultrasonically so you have to record it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then slow it down in order to hear </v>

200
00:12:15.551 --> 00:12:16.384
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they're not very happy about that </v>

201
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:22.860
<v Speaker 2>about cats and they actually don't need </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be exposed to cats to learn how to be</v>

202
00:12:23.681 --> 00:12:26.170
<v Speaker 2>afraid of their older.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're naturally afraid of it.</v>

203
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.450
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Solzhenitsyn's book,</v>

204
00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:31.780
<v Speaker 2>the Gulag Archipelago is like a 2100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>page screen.</v>

205
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:33.910
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very intense.</v>

206
00:12:33.911 --> 00:12:37.420
<v Speaker 2>It's a very difficult thing to read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's absolutely crucial reading.</v>

207
00:12:37.421 --> 00:12:41.050
<v Speaker 2>It's actually now part of the curriculum</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Russia in high school,</v>

208
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:42.183
<v Speaker 2>which also says something about Russian </v>
<v Speaker 2>high school as compared to say North </v>

209
00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:45.993
<v Speaker 2>American high schools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I doubt if the typical North </v>

210
00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:48.813
<v Speaker 2>American high school student reads 2100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>pages of anything during their entire </v>

211
00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:52.683
<v Speaker 2>education in high school and certainly </v>
<v Speaker 2>not something like the Gulag </v>

212
00:12:55.001 --> 00:12:57.370
<v Speaker 2>archipelago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to read you a little bit of</v>

213
00:12:57.371 --> 00:12:58.510
<v Speaker 2>background about the story.</v>

214
00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:01.000
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is a nice summary.</v>

215
00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've swiped it from Wikipedia,</v>

216
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.530
<v Speaker 2>but the Gulag archipelago is a book by </v>
<v Speaker 2>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.</v>

217
00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:10.510
<v Speaker 2>He won a Nobel prize for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the book,</v>

218
00:13:10.511 --> 00:13:11.344
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and richly deserved at about the Soviet </v>

219
00:13:12.851 --> 00:13:13.684
<v Speaker 2>forced labor camp system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The three volume book is a narrative </v>

220
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:22.210
<v Speaker 2>relying on eyewitness testimony and </v>
<v Speaker 2>primary research material as well as the</v>

221
00:13:22.211 --> 00:13:27.211
<v Speaker 2>author's own experiences in a gulag </v>
<v Speaker 2>labor camp written between 1958 and 1968</v>

222
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:33.870
<v Speaker 2>it was published in the West in 1973</v>
<v Speaker 2>and thereafter circulated in Samizdat or</v>

223
00:13:35.861 --> 00:13:39.880
<v Speaker 2>underground publication form in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Soviet Union until its appearance in the</v>

224
00:13:39.881 --> 00:13:44.110
<v Speaker 2>Russian literary journal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Novy Mir in 1989 in which a third of the</v>

225
00:13:44.111 --> 00:13:48.910
<v Speaker 2>work was published over three issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Samizdat or the underground press</v>

226
00:13:48.911 --> 00:13:50.880
<v Speaker 2>was basically photocopies or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

227
00:13:50.881 --> 00:13:51.714
<v Speaker 2>or sometimes photos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stats of band works that people would </v>

228
00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:57.970
<v Speaker 2>compile and then hand from person to </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

229
00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.113
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course the punishment for being </v>

230
00:14:00.221 --> 00:14:03.220
<v Speaker 2>caught with something like that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was extraordinarily severe,</v>

231
00:14:03.221 --> 00:14:04.054
<v Speaker 2>but the Samizdat was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose it was the precursor to the </v>

232
00:14:06.731 --> 00:14:08.530
<v Speaker 2>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

233
00:14:08.531 --> 00:14:11.180
<v Speaker 2>A slow precursor to the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

234
00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:12.693
<v Speaker 2>ghoulag or gee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you lag or ghoulag is an acronym for </v>

235
00:14:15.341 --> 00:14:16.660
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a Russian term,</v>

236
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:20.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chief administration of corrective labor</v>

237
00:14:20.801 --> 00:14:21.634
<v Speaker 2>camps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bureaucratic name of the governing </v>

238
00:14:22.721 --> 00:14:26.490
<v Speaker 2>board of the Soviet labor camp system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by Mytonomy,</v>

239
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:31.500
<v Speaker 2>that camp system itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the word archipelago compares the system</v>

240
00:14:31.631 --> 00:14:36.631
<v Speaker 2>of labor camps spread across the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 2>Union with a vast chain of islands known</v>

241
00:14:36.791 --> 00:14:39.010
<v Speaker 2>only to those who were fated to visit </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

242
00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:41.163
<v Speaker 2>Since the dissolution of the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 2>Union and the formation of the Russian </v>

243
00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:44.973
<v Speaker 2>Federation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Gulag Archipelago has been </v>

244
00:14:45.671 --> 00:14:46.504
<v Speaker 2>officially published and included in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>high school program in Russia as </v>

245
00:14:49.001 --> 00:14:51.340
<v Speaker 2>mandatory reading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Structurally,</v>

246
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:52.663
<v Speaker 2>the terrace comprises seven sections </v>
<v Speaker 2>divided in most printed volumes into </v>

247
00:14:56.541 --> 00:14:58.070
<v Speaker 2>three parts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one to two,</v>

248
00:14:58.071 --> 00:15:01.100
<v Speaker 2>three and four and five to seven at one </v>
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>

249
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.930
<v Speaker 2>the Gulag archipelago traces the history</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the system of forced labor camps that</v>

250
00:15:05.931 --> 00:15:06.764
<v Speaker 2>existed in the Soviet Union from 1918 to</v>
<v Speaker 2>1956 starting with Lenin's original </v>

251
00:15:12.471 --> 00:15:14.990
<v Speaker 2>decrees shortly after the October </v>
<v Speaker 2>Revolution,</v>

252
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:16.123
<v Speaker 2>establishing the legal and practical </v>
<v Speaker 2>framework for a series of camps where </v>

253
00:15:19.071 --> 00:15:19.904
<v Speaker 2>political prisoners and ordinary </v>
<v Speaker 2>criminals would be sentenced to forced </v>

254
00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:23.330
<v Speaker 2>labor.</v>

255
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.090
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that's quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting about the gulag camps,</v>

256
00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:26.924
<v Speaker 2>and this is something that's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>relevant to understanding of modern </v>

257
00:15:29.091 --> 00:15:29.924
<v Speaker 2>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that so ordinary criminals were put </v>

258
00:15:32.001 --> 00:15:32.834
<v Speaker 2>into the camps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we're political prisoner </v>

259
00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:35.750
<v Speaker 2>prisoners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the ordinary criminals.</v>

260
00:15:35.751 --> 00:15:37.610
<v Speaker 2>And so those would be rapists and </v>
<v Speaker 2>murderers,</v>

261
00:15:37.611 --> 00:15:38.444
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well as thieves who were engaged in </v>

262
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:41.653
<v Speaker 2>theft as an occupation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those were regarded by the Soviets as </v>

263
00:15:44.631 --> 00:15:45.464
<v Speaker 2>socially friendly elements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that was that they </v>

264
00:15:48.501 --> 00:15:49.334
<v Speaker 2>assumed that the reason that these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people had turned to crime was because </v>

265
00:15:51.681 --> 00:15:52.514
<v Speaker 2>the pr of the oppressive nature of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>previous czarist slash capitalist </v>

266
00:15:56.601 --> 00:15:57.434
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that the only reason that these </v>

267
00:15:58.701 --> 00:16:01.220
<v Speaker 2>criminals existed was because they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>been oppressed.</v>

268
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.100
<v Speaker 2>They were oppressed victims of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

269
00:16:04.101 --> 00:16:04.934
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the convenient </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences of that absolutely insane </v>

270
00:16:08.451 --> 00:16:09.284
<v Speaker 2>doctrine was that the Soviets put the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ordinary criminals in charge of the </v>

271
00:16:12.621 --> 00:16:13.454
<v Speaker 2>camps.</v>

272
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:16.580
<v Speaker 2>And these were very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very seriously bad people.</v>

273
00:16:16.581 --> 00:16:20.180
<v Speaker 2>And so you can imagine the way that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>treated the political prisoners who were</v>

274
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:24.470
<v Speaker 2>regarded as socially hostile elements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes because of their own,</v>

275
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:25.393
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically traitorous acts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more often merely as a consequence </v>

276
00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:29.473
<v Speaker 2>of their racial or ethnic identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the fact that they were related by </v>

277
00:16:33.231 --> 00:16:37.130
<v Speaker 2>birth to say people who had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful under the previous system.</v>

278
00:16:37.131 --> 00:16:37.964
<v Speaker 2>So who had any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any association with nobility or any </v>

279
00:16:40.281 --> 00:16:41.114
<v Speaker 2>association with what were known as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kulaks who were the only successful </v>

280
00:16:44.541 --> 00:16:45.374
<v Speaker 2>class of former peasants in the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 2>Union because they were regarded as </v>

281
00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:50.173
<v Speaker 2>privileged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You may have heard that word more </v>

282
00:16:51.651 --> 00:16:52.484
<v Speaker 2>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were regarded as privileged and </v>

283
00:16:54.351 --> 00:16:55.184
<v Speaker 2>therefore as enemies of the state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it didn't matter if it was your </v>

284
00:16:57.231 --> 00:16:58.064
<v Speaker 2>father or your grandfather or your great</v>
<v Speaker 2>grandfather who happened to be </v>

285
00:17:00.411 --> 00:17:03.290
<v Speaker 2>privileged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the mere fact that you were a member</v>

286
00:17:03.291 --> 00:17:06.920
<v Speaker 2>of that group was sufficient reason to </v>
<v Speaker 2>put you into a camp.</v>

287
00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:08.143
<v Speaker 2>And we're talking hundreds of thousands </v>
<v Speaker 2>or perhaps millions of people who </v>

288
00:17:10.581 --> 00:17:13.640
<v Speaker 2>underwent that fate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea and the Soviet Union was</v>

289
00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:16.220
<v Speaker 2>just because you are the member of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>class.</v>

290
00:17:16.221 --> 00:17:19.220
<v Speaker 2>Even as a consequence of your familial </v>
<v Speaker 2>association,</v>

291
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.660
<v Speaker 2>you were immediately sufficiently guilty</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be put into a camp and punished.</v>

292
00:17:23.661 --> 00:17:24.494
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the terms for the camps were often </v>

293
00:17:26.361 --> 00:17:28.010
<v Speaker 2>10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 years long.</v>

294
00:17:28.011 --> 00:17:31.220
<v Speaker 2>And if you were very fortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to have two or three of those.</v>

295
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:36.160
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Soviets really implemented and,</v>

296
00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:37.023
<v Speaker 2>and perfected the idea of class and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>this city based guilt and it's a very </v>

297
00:17:41.361 --> 00:17:42.194
<v Speaker 2>bad road to walk down and it's something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're very much engaged in at the </v>

298
00:17:45.381 --> 00:17:46.214
<v Speaker 2>moment because there's discussion </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere in North America now about </v>

299
00:17:49.261 --> 00:17:52.770
<v Speaker 2>the idea of while race predicated guilt </v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

300
00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:53.843
<v Speaker 2>and ethnic predicated guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a very bad idea to classify an </v>

301
00:17:57.871 --> 00:17:58.704
<v Speaker 2>entire group of people as guilty of </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything based on their group </v>

302
00:18:00.841 --> 00:18:01.674
<v Speaker 2>membership.</v>

303
00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:02.963
<v Speaker 2>So these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these sorts of things are things we </v>

304
00:18:04.381 --> 00:18:06.360
<v Speaker 2>haven't yet learned and certainly should</v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

305
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:08.963
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that was very </v>

306
00:18:09.481 --> 00:18:12.900
<v Speaker 2>interesting about the Soviet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially about the Gulag archipelago.</v>

307
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:13.783
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was released in the West in about </v>

308
00:18:14.791 --> 00:18:15.624
<v Speaker 2>1973 or thereabouts now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The student movement of the 1960s was </v>

309
00:18:19.981 --> 00:18:23.610
<v Speaker 2>very much influenced by Marxist and </v>
<v Speaker 2>communist doctrine.</v>

310
00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:24.623
<v Speaker 2>And that was especially the case in </v>
<v Speaker 2>France where the most reprehensible </v>

311
00:18:27.571 --> 00:18:30.000
<v Speaker 2>intellectuals of the 20th century have </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerged,</v>

312
00:18:30.001 --> 00:18:30.834
<v Speaker 2>emerged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including all the damned postmodernists </v>

313
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.710
<v Speaker 2>who've occupied the universities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

314
00:18:34.711 --> 00:18:35.544
<v Speaker 2>as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what happened essentially in France </v>

315
00:18:37.801 --> 00:18:38.634
<v Speaker 2>was that the Marxist slash communist </v>
<v Speaker 2>students were attempting to foment </v>

316
00:18:41.911 --> 00:18:43.920
<v Speaker 2>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what happened,</v>

317
00:18:43.921 --> 00:18:47.970
<v Speaker 2>and that peaked in about 1968 and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened was,</v>

318
00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:51.360
<v Speaker 2>at least in part as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>social knutson's revelations,</v>

319
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.510
<v Speaker 2>the idea that the Soviet model or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouse model,</v>

320
00:18:54.511 --> 00:18:56.790
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be used as a,</v>

321
00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:57.923
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an example of the working people's </v>

322
00:19:01.051 --> 00:19:04.420
<v Speaker 2>Utopia was completely and catastrophic </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lee,</v>

323
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.710
<v Speaker 2>and at least in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>finally undermined.</v>

324
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.150
<v Speaker 2>Now there had been received because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the western leftist intellectuals.</v>

325
00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:12.984
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from 1919 forward turned a blind eye to </v>

326
00:19:16.621 --> 00:19:18.540
<v Speaker 2>what was happening in the Soviet Union </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

327
00:19:18.541 --> 00:19:20.790
<v Speaker 2>And then they were invited there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even people,</v>

328
00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.080
<v Speaker 2>well people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are very real,</v>

329
00:19:23.081 --> 00:19:23.914
<v Speaker 2>well regarded in the west were often </v>
<v Speaker 2>invited and who were sympathetic to the </v>

330
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.180
<v Speaker 2>Soviet Union were often invited there </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a visit and the Soviets would do the</v>

331
00:19:30.181 --> 00:19:33.150
<v Speaker 2>same thing in the North Koreans do now </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they invite foreigners to visit,</v>

332
00:19:33.151 --> 00:19:33.984
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that they would set up fake </v>

333
00:19:35.881 --> 00:19:40.881
<v Speaker 2>places for them to visit called Potemkin</v>
<v Speaker 2>villages where everyone was thriving and</v>

334
00:19:41.521 --> 00:19:42.354
<v Speaker 2>doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That Nazis did the same thing with the </v>

335
00:19:43.621 --> 00:19:46.530
<v Speaker 2>concentration camps to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the ones they established for</v>

336
00:19:46.531 --> 00:19:47.400
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they had,</v>

337
00:19:47.401 --> 00:19:48.234
<v Speaker 2>would invite dimwitted leftist Western </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectuals to come to the Soviet </v>

338
00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:55.000
<v Speaker 2>Union and see the wonderful paradise </v>
<v Speaker 2>that had been set up for everyone,</v>

339
00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.840
<v Speaker 2>which was a complete and your facade and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sham.</v>

340
00:19:58.050 --> 00:19:58.883
<v Speaker 2>And then they would go back to the West </v>
<v Speaker 2>and report on how the utopia was </v>

341
00:20:01.111 --> 00:20:04.230
<v Speaker 2>progressing precisely according to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Marxist doctorates.</v>

342
00:20:04.231 --> 00:20:05.064
<v Speaker 2>And we knew from the 1930s forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause Malcolm muggeridge did this to </v>

343
00:20:08.491 --> 00:20:11.430
<v Speaker 2>begin with who investigated what was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on in the Soviet Union,</v>

344
00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.810
<v Speaker 2>I think for the Manchester Guardian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he started reporting in 19 in the,</v>

345
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:20.950
<v Speaker 2>in the late 19 tans and then the early </v>
<v Speaker 2>1920s if I remember correctly,</v>

346
00:20:20.971 --> 00:20:23.400
<v Speaker 2>it was approximately in that period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a bit later,</v>

347
00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:24.893
<v Speaker 2>he recorded what was happening when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Soviets attempted to collect </v>

348
00:20:27.281 --> 00:20:29.370
<v Speaker 2>collectivize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the peasant farmers.</v>

349
00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:34.230
<v Speaker 2>And so what they did was take all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who were previously pet surfs,</v>

350
00:20:34.231 --> 00:20:35.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only a couple of decades previously,</v>

351
00:20:35.971 --> 00:20:37.980
<v Speaker 2>which was not much better than being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>slave.</v>

352
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:38.993
<v Speaker 2>You're basically property and that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening until about 1880 or </v>

353
00:20:41.671 --> 00:20:43.920
<v Speaker 2>thereabouts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The serfs were emancipated.</v>

354
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:46.230
<v Speaker 2>Many of them ended up holding their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>land.</v>

355
00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:46.470
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

356
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:49.240
<v Speaker 2>So the land was from the nobles to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>peasantry.</v>

357
00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:53.380
<v Speaker 2>That was something that tolstoy was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leo tolstoy was involved in,</v>

358
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.830
<v Speaker 2>and by the time the Soviet revolution </v>
<v Speaker 2>came around,</v>

359
00:20:56.831 --> 00:21:01.831
<v Speaker 2>which would be at the latter part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>19 teens after the first world war,</v>

360
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:06.310
<v Speaker 2>the peasant class had actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>established farms,</v>

361
00:21:06.311 --> 00:21:08.080
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>varying productivity.</v>

362
00:21:08.081 --> 00:21:08.914
<v Speaker 2>Some of the peasant farmers were very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very good at being farmers and produced </v>

363
00:21:12.581 --> 00:21:16.060
<v Speaker 2>a huge proportion of Russia's and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ukraine's food.</v>

364
00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:19.360
<v Speaker 2>Because one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll talk about this later as the class</v>

365
00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:21.420
<v Speaker 2>progressed is one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll find if the,</v>

366
00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.670
<v Speaker 2>if you look at creative production in </v>
<v Speaker 2>any domain,</v>

367
00:21:24.671 --> 00:21:26.770
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Artistic Domain,</v>

368
00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.710
<v Speaker 2>food production,</v>
<v Speaker 2>novels,</v>

369
00:21:29.711 --> 00:21:31.330
<v Speaker 2>written novels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sold,</v>

370
00:21:31.331 --> 00:21:33.850
<v Speaker 2>money generated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>number of companies generated,</v>

371
00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:36.700
<v Speaker 2>number of goals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scored in hockey,</v>

372
00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:39.820
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any number of paintings,</v>

373
00:21:39.821 --> 00:21:41.800
<v Speaker 2>painted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>number of compositions written,</v>

374
00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:42.634
<v Speaker 2>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where where the fundamental underlying </v>

375
00:21:45.821 --> 00:21:47.350
<v Speaker 2>measure is human productivity.</v>

376
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.183
<v Speaker 2>What you find is that a very tiny </v>
<v Speaker 2>percentage of people produce almost all </v>

377
00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.010
<v Speaker 2>the output.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called a pareto distribution,</v>

378
00:21:54.011 --> 00:21:54.441
<v Speaker 2>p,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

379
00:21:54.441 --> 00:21:54.891
<v Speaker 2>r,</v>
<v Speaker 2>e,</v>

380
00:21:54.891 --> 00:21:55.724
<v Speaker 2>t,</v>
<v Speaker 2>O,</v>

381
00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:59.410
<v Speaker 2>and it was studied in detail in </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific productivity by someone named</v>

382
00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:00.910
<v Speaker 2>Desal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a price.</v>

383
00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:03.260
<v Speaker 2>It's a square root law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's the law.</v>

384
00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.173
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the number of people who </v>

385
00:22:06.251 --> 00:22:07.540
<v Speaker 2>are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are,</v>

386
00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:10.990
<v Speaker 2>who are in a given domain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are producing in a given domain,</v>

387
00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:14.680
<v Speaker 2>the square root of the people produce </v>
<v Speaker 2>half the product.</v>

388
00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:18.490
<v Speaker 2>So that means if you have 10 employees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three of them do half the work,</v>

389
00:22:18.491 --> 00:22:22.450
<v Speaker 2>but if you have 10,000 employees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hundred of them do half the work,</v>

390
00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:23.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very,</v>

391
00:22:23.951 --> 00:22:24.784
<v Speaker 2>very vicious statistic and you won't </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn about that in psychology for </v>

392
00:22:27.551 --> 00:22:28.384
<v Speaker 2>reasons I have no idea about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you learn about the normal </v>

393
00:22:30.641 --> 00:22:32.650
<v Speaker 2>distribution and not the prieto </v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution,</v>

394
00:22:32.651 --> 00:22:35.350
<v Speaker 2>but pareto distributions govern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

395
00:22:35.351 --> 00:22:36.184
<v Speaker 2>the distribution of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why 1% of the people in the </v>

396
00:22:39.641 --> 00:22:40.474
<v Speaker 2>general population have the overwhelming</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of money and one 10th of that 1% </v>

397
00:22:44.591 --> 00:22:46.570
<v Speaker 2>has almost all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

398
00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:47.403
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's like the richest hundred</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the world have as much money </v>

399
00:22:51.131 --> 00:22:53.680
<v Speaker 2>as the bottom two and a half billion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you think,</v>

400
00:22:53.681 --> 00:22:55.870
<v Speaker 2>well that's a terrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And perhaps it is.</v>

401
00:22:55.871 --> 00:22:56.704
<v Speaker 2>But what you have to understand is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that law governs the distribution of </v>

402
00:23:00.161 --> 00:23:02.950
<v Speaker 2>creative production across all creative </v>
<v Speaker 2>domains,</v>

403
00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:05.290
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like a natural law.</v>

404
00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:06.760
<v Speaker 2>And we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll talk about that more,</v>

405
00:23:06.761 --> 00:23:09.100
<v Speaker 2>but imagine what happens when you play </v>
<v Speaker 2>monopoly.</v>

406
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:12.130
<v Speaker 2>You've all played monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens when you play monopoly?</v>

407
00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:14.950
<v Speaker 2>One person ends up with all the money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

408
00:23:14.951 --> 00:23:17.470
<v Speaker 2>Then you play another game of monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens?</v>

409
00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:22.000
<v Speaker 2>One person ends up with all the money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually the inevitable consequence</v>

410
00:23:22.001 --> 00:23:24.970
<v Speaker 2>of multiple trades that are conducted </v>
<v Speaker 2>randomly.</v>

411
00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:28.240
<v Speaker 2>So if you take a thousand people and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get them to play a trading game,</v>

412
00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:29.253
<v Speaker 2>you get each give them $100 say or $10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have to trade with another </v>

413
00:23:32.501 --> 00:23:36.850
<v Speaker 2>person by flipping a coin I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the coin toss you give me a dollar,</v>

414
00:23:36.851 --> 00:23:38.080
<v Speaker 2>you win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I give you a dollar.</v>

415
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:39.063
<v Speaker 2>If we all play that long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one person will end up with all the </v>

416
00:23:41.171 --> 00:23:43.660
<v Speaker 2>money and everyone else will end up with</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero.</v>

417
00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:45.003
<v Speaker 2>So it's a deeply built feature of </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems of creative production and no </v>

418
00:23:49.641 --> 00:23:50.474
<v Speaker 2>one really knows what to do about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of course the danger is is that </v>

419
00:23:52.761 --> 00:23:57.410
<v Speaker 2>all the resources get funneled to a tiny</v>
<v Speaker 2>minority of people at the top and a huge</v>

420
00:23:57.411 --> 00:23:59.930
<v Speaker 2>section of the population stacks up at </v>
<v Speaker 2>zero.</v>

421
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:05.470
<v Speaker 2>But to blame that on the oppressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature of a given system is to radically</v>

422
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:07.970
<v Speaker 2>underestimate the complexity of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

423
00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.013
<v Speaker 2>No one actually knows how to effectively</v>
<v Speaker 2>shovel resources from the minority that </v>

424
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:17.210
<v Speaker 2>that controls almost everything to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>majority.</v>

425
00:24:17.211 --> 00:24:20.240
<v Speaker 2>That has almost nothing in any </v>
<v Speaker 2>consistent way.</v>

426
00:24:20.241 --> 00:24:21.074
<v Speaker 2>Because as you shovel money down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it tends to move right back up and it's </v>

427
00:24:24.291 --> 00:24:25.670
<v Speaker 2>a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

428
00:24:25.671 --> 00:24:29.600
<v Speaker 2>the reason I'm telling you about that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>because after the peasants were,</v>

429
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:32.120
<v Speaker 2>were granted their land and started to </v>
<v Speaker 2>become farmers,</v>

430
00:24:32.121 --> 00:24:35.240
<v Speaker 2>a tiny minority of them became extremely</v>
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>

431
00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:39.550
<v Speaker 2>And those people produced almost all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the food for Russia and Ukraine.</v>

432
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:40.423
<v Speaker 2>So what happened in the 1920s when </v>
<v Speaker 2>bloody lennon came along and </v>

433
00:24:43.371 --> 00:24:44.204
<v Speaker 2>collectivize the farms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that they defined the Kulaks who </v>

434
00:24:46.251 --> 00:24:47.084
<v Speaker 2>were these tiny minority of successful </v>
<v Speaker 2>farmers who maybe had a brick house and </v>

435
00:24:50.421 --> 00:24:51.254
<v Speaker 2>were able to hire a couple of people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>had some land and some livestock and </v>

436
00:24:54.651 --> 00:24:58.910
<v Speaker 2>were very productive people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They defined them as socially unfriendly</v>

437
00:24:58.911 --> 00:24:59.744
<v Speaker 2>elements and they sent groups of </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectuals out into the towns to </v>

438
00:25:02.061 --> 00:25:05.810
<v Speaker 2>collectivize the farms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea was that while you would</v>

439
00:25:05.811 --> 00:25:06.644
<v Speaker 2>pool your land and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everyone would farm it collectively </v>

440
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:13.940
<v Speaker 2>and the land was taken away of course </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the tiny minority of people who are</v>

441
00:25:13.941 --> 00:25:17.180
<v Speaker 2>actually productive and had actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>managed to own much of the land.</v>

442
00:25:17.181 --> 00:25:19.430
<v Speaker 2>So you have to imagine how that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>occur.</v>

443
00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:20.623
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's in the 1920s it's after the </v>

444
00:25:22.701 --> 00:25:25.670
<v Speaker 2>world after World War One rushes in </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty bad shape.</v>

445
00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:26.503
<v Speaker 2>The villages are full of brutalized men </v>
<v Speaker 2>who have post traumatic stress disorder </v>

446
00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:32.720
<v Speaker 2>and lots of people who are not doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>well at all.</v>

447
00:25:32.721 --> 00:25:35.090
<v Speaker 2>And the bloody intellectuals come into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the town and they say,</v>

448
00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:36.103
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those successful farmers up the street </v>

449
00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:38.623
<v Speaker 2>that you've always been pretty jealous </v>
<v Speaker 2>about in your useless manner while </v>

450
00:25:42.141 --> 00:25:45.500
<v Speaker 2>they're actually pigs and demons who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>stealing from you.</v>

451
00:25:45.501 --> 00:25:46.334
<v Speaker 2>So why don't you come out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll form a nice little mob and we'll </v>

452
00:25:48.081 --> 00:25:51.290
<v Speaker 2>take everything they've got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly what happened.</v>

453
00:25:51.291 --> 00:25:52.124
<v Speaker 2>And all those people were killed or </v>
<v Speaker 2>raped or set off to Siberia in the </v>

454
00:25:54.981 --> 00:25:57.850
<v Speaker 2>middle of the bloody winter where there </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't even anything for them to,</v>

455
00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:00.830
<v Speaker 2>to anywhere for them to live or anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>for them to eat.</v>

456
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:01.783
<v Speaker 2>So they all died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the consequence of that was a </v>

457
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:07.310
<v Speaker 2>few years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>6 million people starved to death in the</v>

458
00:26:07.311 --> 00:26:08.144
<v Speaker 2>Ukraine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Malcolm Muggeridge had been </v>

459
00:26:09.471 --> 00:26:13.130
<v Speaker 2>reporting on that since the 1930s and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the,</v>

460
00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:14.443
<v Speaker 2>that was the first wind really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the west God of exactly what was </v>

461
00:26:17.151 --> 00:26:18.440
<v Speaker 2>happening in the Soviet Union.</v>

462
00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.513
<v Speaker 2>But even at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that bloody left wing intellectuals in </v>

463
00:26:21.651 --> 00:26:22.484
<v Speaker 2>North America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're so damn clueless and in Europe </v>

464
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:26.020
<v Speaker 2>that they never paid much attention to </v>
<v Speaker 2>it with,</v>

465
00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.860
<v Speaker 2>with the exception of certain number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like George Orwell who wrote 1984</v>

466
00:26:30.861 --> 00:26:31.970
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a,</v>

467
00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:35.120
<v Speaker 2>and a animal farm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is of course a discussion.</v>

468
00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:38.510
<v Speaker 2>The main pig in animal farm is stallon </v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

469
00:26:38.511 --> 00:26:39.344
<v Speaker 2>And it's a story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an allegory about the Russian </v>

470
00:26:41.811 --> 00:26:44.670
<v Speaker 2>revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whose basic motif is,</v>

471
00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:45.653
<v Speaker 2>we're all equal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But of course some all animals are </v>

472
00:26:47.761 --> 00:26:50.130
<v Speaker 2>equal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some are more equal than others.</v>

473
00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:53.300
<v Speaker 2>And that's the motif.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the Motif of animal farms.</v>

474
00:26:53.301 --> 00:26:55.380
<v Speaker 2>So there had been warnings all the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>

475
00:26:55.381 --> 00:26:56.214
<v Speaker 2>right from the beginning of the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolution to the West about exactly </v>

476
00:26:58.861 --> 00:26:59.694
<v Speaker 2>what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But because communists and Marxists </v>

477
00:27:02.171 --> 00:27:03.004
<v Speaker 2>videology is very good at Adlink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the the week binds of idiot </v>

478
00:27:06.121 --> 00:27:06.954
<v Speaker 2>intellectuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a huge section of the </v>

479
00:27:08.521 --> 00:27:11.130
<v Speaker 2>population who was fomenting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose,</v>

480
00:27:11.131 --> 00:27:13.590
<v Speaker 2>against the standard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it?</v>

481
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:15.150
<v Speaker 2>Political,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological,</v>

482
00:27:15.151 --> 00:27:17.120
<v Speaker 2>and social order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who were,</v>

483
00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.073
<v Speaker 2>we're absolutely committed to the ethic </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's encased in statements like from </v>

484
00:27:22.201 --> 00:27:25.110
<v Speaker 2>each according to his ability to each </v>
<v Speaker 2>according to his need,</v>

485
00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:28.860
<v Speaker 2>which sounds perfectly wonderful if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about it for about 15 seconds.</v>

486
00:27:28.861 --> 00:27:29.694
<v Speaker 2>But if you think about it for six months</v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes unbelievably murderous and it's </v>

487
00:27:33.451 --> 00:27:35.610
<v Speaker 2>reaching and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the intent.</v>

488
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.010
<v Speaker 2>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the French,</v>

489
00:27:38.011 --> 00:27:38.844
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seem to be particularly opaque to </v>

490
00:27:40.951 --> 00:27:42.540
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you an example.</v>

491
00:27:42.541 --> 00:27:43.374
<v Speaker 2>So the doctrine of Pol Pot in Cambodia </v>
<v Speaker 2>that also killed about 6 million people </v>

492
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:49.423
<v Speaker 2>hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what they did in Cambodia once the </v>

493
00:27:51.301 --> 00:27:52.134
<v Speaker 2>revolution occurred was decided that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone in the city were parasites on </v>

494
00:27:55.291 --> 00:27:56.124
<v Speaker 2>the countryside because the countryside </v>
<v Speaker 2>full of farmers was where the primary </v>

495
00:27:58.531 --> 00:27:59.364
<v Speaker 2>production was taking place and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>regarded the city dwellers as parasites </v>

496
00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:06.060
<v Speaker 2>on that fundamental production.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they basically emptied out the cities</v>

497
00:28:06.061 --> 00:28:06.894
<v Speaker 2>and up sent all the people in the cities</v>
<v Speaker 2>out to work in the country as forced </v>

498
00:28:10.351 --> 00:28:10.740
<v Speaker 2>labor.</v>

499
00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:11.573
<v Speaker 2>And 6 million people died there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the chief architect of that bloody </v>

500
00:28:14.701 --> 00:28:19.290
<v Speaker 2>project got his phd from the Sorbonne </v>
<v Speaker 2>and said exactly what he was going to do</v>

501
00:28:19.291 --> 00:28:20.124
<v Speaker 2>when he went back to Cambodia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was cheered along by the French </v>

502
00:28:22.411 --> 00:28:24.870
<v Speaker 2>intellectuals who thought that that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>just a fine idea.</v>

503
00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.273
<v Speaker 2>So that's all background for why I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>think any of you guys really know much </v>

504
00:28:29.191 --> 00:28:31.800
<v Speaker 2>about 20th century history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

505
00:28:31.801 --> 00:28:32.634
<v Speaker 2>what happened in the 1970s when when </v>
<v Speaker 2>Solzhenitsyn published the Gulag </v>

506
00:28:36.751 --> 00:28:40.230
<v Speaker 2>archipelago was that it was so </v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant,</v>

507
00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:41.093
<v Speaker 2>the book and so overwhelming and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional and intellectual and </v>

508
00:28:45.241 --> 00:28:46.074
<v Speaker 2>historical power that it became </v>
<v Speaker 2>impossible for anyone to continue to </v>

509
00:28:51.451 --> 00:28:52.284
<v Speaker 2>claim that Marxism slash communism had </v>
<v Speaker 2>any intellectual or ethical integrity </v>

510
00:28:57.570 --> 00:28:59.610
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was done,</v>

511
00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.950
<v Speaker 2>it was done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's part of the reason why he won</v>

512
00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.340
<v Speaker 2>the Nobel Prize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And part of the reason,</v>

513
00:29:05.341 --> 00:29:07.470
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why the Soviet Union collapsed,</v>

514
00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:11.820
<v Speaker 2>because once word got out about exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>what was actually going on,</v>

515
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.360
<v Speaker 2>there was no way of making a coherent </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument in favor of say,</v>

516
00:29:15.361 --> 00:29:17.940
<v Speaker 2>exporting the Worker's revolution around</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

517
00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:18.803
<v Speaker 2>It's like the consequence of that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>well documented by Solzhenitsyn and see </v>

518
00:29:22.601 --> 00:29:23.434
<v Speaker 2>it in the western intellectuals tried to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make excuses for what had happened in </v>

519
00:29:27.361 --> 00:29:28.194
<v Speaker 2>the Soviet Union by blaming it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Stalins cultive personality perversion </v>

520
00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.530
<v Speaker 2>of the original accurate Marxist </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctrines.</v>

521
00:29:36.531 --> 00:29:37.860
<v Speaker 2>So they basically said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

522
00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:42.370
<v Speaker 2>Lennon had Lenin lived cause he died </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite young and was replaced by Stellan.</v>

523
00:29:42.371 --> 00:29:43.204
<v Speaker 2>Had Lenin lived,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the promised utopia would have been </v>

524
00:29:45.461 --> 00:29:46.294
<v Speaker 2>delivered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Solzhenitsyn being an absolute </v>

525
00:29:47.801 --> 00:29:48.634
<v Speaker 2>genius documented the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>number one b between the axioms of </v>

526
00:29:53.921 --> 00:29:54.754
<v Speaker 2>Marxist and communist thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the laws that were generated </v>

527
00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.353
<v Speaker 2>primarily by Lenin and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the construction of these camps and </v>

528
00:30:01.781 --> 00:30:04.000
<v Speaker 2>the d Kulak ization and all the mass </v>
<v Speaker 2>murders.</v>

529
00:30:04.001 --> 00:30:04.834
<v Speaker 2>He documented the causal relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>between them and laid them clearly at </v>

530
00:30:08.621 --> 00:30:10.750
<v Speaker 2>the feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not have stellan but of Lennon.</v>

531
00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:13.650
<v Speaker 2>And so that was also a major blow </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it,</v>

532
00:30:13.651 --> 00:30:14.484
<v Speaker 2>it undermined the remaining argument of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the left way radical left wing </v>

533
00:30:18.131 --> 00:30:19.860
<v Speaker 2>apologists in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

534
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:20.703
<v Speaker 2>in the West for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the viability of Marxist slash </v>

535
00:30:24.071 --> 00:30:25.090
<v Speaker 2>communist doctrines.</v>

536
00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:28.660
<v Speaker 2>And you still hear people today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many people when they're faced with the,</v>

537
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:29.651
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're,</v>

538
00:30:29.651 --> 00:30:30.484
<v Speaker 2>if they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're Marxist in their orientation </v>

539
00:30:32.111 --> 00:30:32.944
<v Speaker 2>and they're faced with the data </v>
<v Speaker 2>pertaining to what happened in the </v>

540
00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:36.670
<v Speaker 2>Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll say something like,</v>

541
00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:37.653
<v Speaker 2>well that wasn't real Marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that you might </v>

542
00:30:40.181 --> 00:30:41.710
<v Speaker 2>answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well fine,</v>

543
00:30:41.711 --> 00:30:42.544
<v Speaker 2>except that in every bloody country in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world where that doctrine was </v>

544
00:30:45.371 --> 00:30:46.660
<v Speaker 2>implemented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new,</v>

545
00:30:46.661 --> 00:30:49.880
<v Speaker 2>regardless of the wide cultural </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences between the culture,</v>

546
00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.760
<v Speaker 2>say the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>China,</v>

547
00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:52.713
<v Speaker 2>Cambodia and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly the same thing happened every </v>

548
00:30:56.141 --> 00:30:56.974
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we still have a great example of </v>

549
00:30:58.331 --> 00:30:59.164
<v Speaker 2>that today in the form of North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've ever looked at a </v>

550
00:31:02.261 --> 00:31:04.420
<v Speaker 2>map of the world at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

551
00:31:04.421 --> 00:31:06.400
<v Speaker 2>you can get a map of the entire globe at</v>
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

552
00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.980
<v Speaker 2>You look at South Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's lit up like jewels.</v>

553
00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:09.813
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing but light like the east </v>
<v Speaker 2>coast of the United States and Canada </v>

554
00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:13.173
<v Speaker 2>and North Korea is dark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that 50 60 </v>

555
00:31:17.561 --> 00:31:18.394
<v Speaker 2>years of barbaric communist despotic </v>
<v Speaker 2>rule means a country that's completely </v>

556
00:31:22.571 --> 00:31:23.404
<v Speaker 2>in an industrialized where every single </v>
<v Speaker 2>person is male nourished or starving to </v>

557
00:31:27.401 --> 00:31:28.234
<v Speaker 2>death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where everyone lives in terror all the </v>

558
00:31:29.741 --> 00:31:30.574
<v Speaker 2>time and where there's nothing but the </v>
<v Speaker 2>continual production of labor in labor </v>

559
00:31:34.211 --> 00:31:36.790
<v Speaker 2>camps just like in the Soviet Union and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Maoist China.</v>

560
00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:38.043
<v Speaker 2>So if we were willing to pay attention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could still see examples of that </v>

561
00:31:40.391 --> 00:31:42.250
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not an anomaly.</v>

562
00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:43.683
<v Speaker 2>North Korea is exactly what you'd expect</v>
<v Speaker 2>given the doctrines upon which it's </v>

563
00:31:46.241 --> 00:31:48.040
<v Speaker 2>founded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

564
00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.830
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so more on the ghoulag.</v>

565
00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.480
<v Speaker 2>At one level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Gulag archipelago traces the history</v>

566
00:31:59.481 --> 00:32:00.314
<v Speaker 2>of forced labor camps that existed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Soviet Union from 1918 to 1956 </v>

567
00:32:04.731 --> 00:32:05.564
<v Speaker 2>started with Lenin's original decrees </v>
<v Speaker 2>shortly after the October Revolution </v>

568
00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:10.003
<v Speaker 2>establishing the legal and practical </v>
<v Speaker 2>framework for a series of camps where </v>

569
00:32:12.591 --> 00:32:13.424
<v Speaker 2>political prisoners and ordinary </v>

<v Speaker 2>context of the development of the </v>

<v Speaker 2>Greater Gulag system with particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to the legal and bureaucratic </v>

<v Speaker 2>development.</v>

<v Speaker 2>in 1956 the time of Nikita Khrushchev </v>
<v Speaker 2>secret speech at the 20th Party Congress</v>

575
00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:39.740
<v Speaker 2>denouncing Stalin's personality cult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his power,</v>

576
00:32:39.741 --> 00:32:42.620
<v Speaker 2>and the surveillance that pervaded the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stele and error.</v>

577
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:46.910
<v Speaker 2>Though the speech was not published in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the USSR for a long time,</v>

578
00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:50.630
<v Speaker 2>it was a break with the most atrocious </v>
<v Speaker 2>practices of the Gulag system.</v>

579
00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.970
<v Speaker 2>Solzhenitsyn was aware,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>

580
00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:54.133
<v Speaker 2>that the outlines of the system had </v>
<v Speaker 2>survived and could be revived and </v>

581
00:32:56.871 --> 00:32:58.430
<v Speaker 2>expanded by future leaders.</v>

582
00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:03.920
<v Speaker 2>Despite the efforts by soldier knits and</v>
<v Speaker 2>and others to confront the legacy of the</v>

583
00:33:03.921 --> 00:33:04.754
<v Speaker 2>ghoulag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reality of the camps remained taboo </v>

584
00:33:06.681 --> 00:33:07.514
<v Speaker 2>until the 1980s well crew share of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Communist Party and the Soviet Union </v>

585
00:33:11.421 --> 00:33:12.254
<v Speaker 2>supporters in the West viewed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ghoulag is a deviation of the of Stalin </v>

586
00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:17.893
<v Speaker 2>Solzhenitsyn and many among the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposition tended to view it as a </v>

587
00:33:19.461 --> 00:33:23.660
<v Speaker 2>systematic fault of Soviet political </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture and an inevitable outcome of the</v>

588
00:33:23.661 --> 00:33:24.494
<v Speaker 2>Bolshevik political project.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Parallel to this historical and legal </v>

589
00:33:28.431 --> 00:33:29.264
<v Speaker 2>narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Solzhenitsyn follows the typical course </v>

00:33:31.041 --> 00:33:34.580
<v Speaker 2>of a Zack,</v>

00:34:51.381 --> 00:34:52.214
<v Speaker 2>as coauthor of the book,</v>

612
00:34:55.401 --> 00:34:56.234
<v Speaker 2>poetically reintroduces his character of</v>

613
00:35:00.231 --> 00:35:03.530
<v Speaker 2>of the book when questioned by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>book's author,</v>

614
00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:04.393
<v Speaker 2>if he has faithfully recounted the story</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Gulag Denisovich now apparently </v>

<v Speaker 2>volume of firsthand testimony in primary</v>
<v Speaker 2>documentation that social knits and </v>

617
00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:20.443
<v Speaker 2>managed to assemble in the Gulag </v>
<v Speaker 2>archipelago made all subsequent Soviet </v>

618
00:35:24.081 --> 00:35:27.200
<v Speaker 2>and kgb attempts to discredit the work </v>
<v Speaker 2>useless.</v>

619
00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:28.513
<v Speaker 2>Much of the impact of the tree ties </v>
<v Speaker 2>stems from the closely detailed stories </v>

620
00:35:32.271 --> 00:35:35.870
<v Speaker 2>of interrogation routines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prison indignities,</v>

621
00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:39.570
<v Speaker 2>and especially section three camp </v>
<v Speaker 2>massacres,</v>

622
00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:40.523
<v Speaker 2>massacres and inhuman practices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There had been works about the Soviet </v>

623
00:35:44.101 --> 00:35:44.934
<v Speaker 2>prison camp system before and its </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence had been known to the Western </v>

624
00:35:47.761 --> 00:35:48.594
<v Speaker 2>public since the 1930s however,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never before had the general reading </v>

625
00:35:52.201 --> 00:35:55.290
<v Speaker 2>public been brought face to face with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the horrors of the Gulag.</v>

626
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:58.860
<v Speaker 2>In this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The controversy surrounding this text in</v>

627
00:35:58.861 --> 00:35:59.694
<v Speaker 2>particular was largely due to the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>soldier knits and definitively and </v>

628
00:36:03.691 --> 00:36:08.691
<v Speaker 2>painstakingly laid the theoretical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>legal and practical origins of the Gulag</v>

629
00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:11.220
<v Speaker 2>System at Lennon's feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not Stalin's.</v>

630
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:12.383
<v Speaker 2>According to Solzhenitsyn testimony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stalin merely amplified a concentration </v>

631
00:36:16.201 --> 00:36:17.034
<v Speaker 2>camp system that was already in place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is significant as many western </v>

632
00:36:20.701 --> 00:36:21.534
<v Speaker 2>intellectuals viewed the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentration camp system as a </v>

633
00:36:24.351 --> 00:36:25.184
<v Speaker 2>stalinists aberration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>soldier knits and documented that the </v>

634
00:36:28.021 --> 00:36:28.854
<v Speaker 2>Soviet government could not govern </v>
<v Speaker 2>without the threat of imprisonment and </v>

635
00:36:32.041 --> 00:36:36.240
<v Speaker 2>that Soviet economy depended on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>productivity of the forced labor camps,</v>

636
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:37.103
<v Speaker 2>especially in so far as the development </v>
<v Speaker 2>and construction of public works and </v>

637
00:36:40.291 --> 00:36:41.040
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure.</v>

638
00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:41.873
<v Speaker 2>We're concerned this put into doubt the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire moral standing of the Soviet </v>

639
00:36:45.961 --> 00:36:49.920
<v Speaker 2>system in western Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The book eventually contributed strongly</v>

640
00:36:49.921 --> 00:36:54.600
<v Speaker 2>to a need for rethinking of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>historical role of Lennon with the Gulag</v>

641
00:36:54.601 --> 00:36:58.710
<v Speaker 2>Archipelago Lenin's political and </v>
<v Speaker 2>historical legacy became problematic.</v>

642
00:36:58.820 --> 00:36:59.653
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>problematic and his and the those </v>

643
00:37:01.951 --> 00:37:02.784
<v Speaker 2>factions of western Communist parties </v>
<v Speaker 2>who still based their economic and </v>

644
00:37:05.371 --> 00:37:08.280
<v Speaker 2>political ideology on Lennon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're faced with,</v>

645
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:10.680
<v Speaker 2>we're left with a heavy burden of proof </v>
<v Speaker 2>against them.</v>

646
00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:12.173
<v Speaker 2>George F Kennan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the influential US diplomat called the </v>

647
00:37:14.911 --> 00:37:17.710
<v Speaker 2>Gulag archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most powerful thing,</v>

648
00:37:17.711 --> 00:37:22.050
<v Speaker 2>google indictment of a political regime </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever to be levied in modern times.</v>

649
00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:25.410
<v Speaker 2>The book was published at a time when </v>
<v Speaker 2>many communists in the west.</v>

650
00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:28.680
<v Speaker 2>We're already rethinking their </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships with the USSR.</v>

651
00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:29.663
<v Speaker 2>As many were deeply disappointed by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 in </v>

652
00:37:34.861 --> 00:37:35.694
<v Speaker 2>Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sparked discussions not only about </v>

653
00:37:37.141 --> 00:37:40.890
<v Speaker 2>Lennon ism but also how to deal with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>memory of World War II.</v>

654
00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:45.720
<v Speaker 2>In an interview with German weekly Zeit </v>
<v Speaker 2>British historian,</v>

655
00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:46.643
<v Speaker 2>Orlando,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fiji has asserted that many ghoulag </v>

656
00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:49.943
<v Speaker 2>inmates he interviewed for his research </v>
<v Speaker 2>identified so strongly with the book's </v>

657
00:37:53.401 --> 00:37:54.234
<v Speaker 2>contents that they became unable to </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinguish between their own </v>

658
00:37:56.371 --> 00:37:57.204
<v Speaker 2>experiences and what they read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Gulag archipelago spoke for a whole </v>

659
00:38:00.481 --> 00:38:03.120
<v Speaker 2>nation and was the voice of those who </v>
<v Speaker 2>had suffered</v>

660
00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:05.963
<v Speaker 2>after the KGB had confiscated a social </v>
<v Speaker 2>knutson's materials in Moscow during </v>

661
00:38:09.871 --> 00:38:14.871
<v Speaker 2>1957 to 1967 the preparatory drafts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Gulag archipelago,</v>

662
00:38:15.391 --> 00:38:16.224
<v Speaker 2>we're turning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turned into finished manuscripts </v>

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.033
<v Speaker 2>sometimes in hiding at his friend's </v>

665
00:38:26.161 --> 00:38:30.060
<v Speaker 2>1945 Solzhenitsyn had befriended Arnold </v>

673
00:38:56.591 --> 00:38:57.424
<v Speaker 1>In 1991 the KGB seized one of the only </v>

675
00:39:08.651 --> 00:39:09.484
<v Speaker 1>of the other copies this they achieved </v>

00:39:35.831 --> 00:39:36.664
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but had decided to release the work </v>

684
00:39:38.261 --> 00:39:41.080
<v Speaker 1>about 10 days earlier than he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>expected.</v>

685
00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:42.093
<v Speaker 1>News of the nature of the work </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately caused a stir and </v>

686
00:39:44.111 --> 00:39:47.860
<v Speaker 1>translations into many other languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>followed within the next few months,</v>

687
00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:50.380
<v Speaker 1>sometimes produced in a race against </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

688
00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:53.920
<v Speaker 1>American Thomas Whitney produced the </v>
<v Speaker 1>English version.</v>

689
00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:54.933
<v Speaker 1>The English and French translations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>volume one appeared in the spring and </v>

690
00:39:57.131 --> 00:40:02.131
<v Speaker 1>summer of 1974 Solzhenitsyn had wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>the manuscript to be published in Russia</v>

691
00:40:02.681 --> 00:40:03.514
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but knew this was impossible under </v>

692
00:40:04.721 --> 00:40:08.980
<v Speaker 1>conditions then extent the work made a </v>
<v Speaker 1>profound impact internationally.</v>

693
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:11.920
<v Speaker 1>Not only did it provoke energetic debate</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the West,</v>

694
00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:12.913
<v Speaker 1>a mere six weeks after the work had left</v>
<v Speaker 1>breezy and presses soldier nets and </v>

695
00:40:15.731 --> 00:40:16.564
<v Speaker 1>himself was forced into exile because </v>
<v Speaker 1>possession of the manuscript incurred </v>

696
00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:23.440
<v Speaker 1>the risk of a long prison sentence for </v>
<v Speaker 1>anti-soviet activities.</v>

697
00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:27.400
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn never worked on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>manuscript in complete form since he was</v>

698
00:40:27.401 --> 00:40:28.234
<v Speaker 1>under constant kgb surveillance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He worked on only one part of the </v>

699
00:40:31.001 --> 00:40:34.330
<v Speaker 1>manuscript at a time so as not to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>the full book into jeopardy.</v>

700
00:40:34.331 --> 00:40:36.880
<v Speaker 1>If he happened to be arrested for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>

701
00:40:36.881 --> 00:40:37.714
<v Speaker 1>he secretive the various parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>work throughout Moscow and the </v>

702
00:40:40.061 --> 00:40:43.030
<v Speaker 1>surrounding countryside in the care of </v>
<v Speaker 1>trusted friends.</v>

703
00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.560
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes purportedly visiting them on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

704
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:46.503
<v Speaker 1>on the social calls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually working on the manuscript </v>

705
00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:50.043
<v Speaker 1>in their homes.</v>

706
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.900
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

707
00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:55.680
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now I want to show you some things.</v>

708
00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:59.310
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'll see how it goes.</v>

709
00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:01.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to show you something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened recently.</v>

710
00:41:01.951 --> 00:41:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Some of you may be aware of this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of you not.</v>

711
00:41:04.921 --> 00:41:05.754
<v Speaker 1>So this is a video about there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a town meeting that a number </v>

712
00:41:11.881 --> 00:41:13.010
<v Speaker 1>of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

713
00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:14.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spoke out,</v>

714
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:20.030
<v Speaker 1>including one shopkeeper from New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And after the meeting he was interviewed</v>

715
00:41:23.671 --> 00:41:25.290
<v Speaker 1>by the PR,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the press,</v>

716
00:41:25.291 --> 00:41:26.124
<v Speaker 1>the TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the attendees at the meeting </v>

717
00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 1>was upset about the fact that the press </v>
<v Speaker 1>was concentrating on him</v>

718
00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:37.580
<v Speaker 2>instead of concentrating on what she </v>
<v Speaker 2>regarded as the issues at hand.</v>

719
00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:40.550
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to play this for you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>begin with.</v>

720
00:41:40.551 --> 00:41:41.384
<v Speaker 2>Now what I'm trying to show you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to show you what it means for </v>

721
00:41:43.821 --> 00:41:44.654
<v Speaker 2>someone to be ideologically possessed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you can tell when you're talking </v>

722
00:41:48.981 --> 00:41:51.470
<v Speaker 2>to someone like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because this is something I learned from</v>

723
00:41:51.471 --> 00:41:52.304
<v Speaker 2>reading soldier Netsim is because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can predict absolutely everything </v>

724
00:41:54.891 --> 00:41:55.724
<v Speaker 2>they're going to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you know the algorithmic </v>

725
00:41:57.591 --> 00:41:59.870
<v Speaker 2>substructure of their political </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology,</v>

726
00:41:59.871 --> 00:42:02.780
<v Speaker 2>which is usually predicated on about </v>
<v Speaker 2>five or six axioms.</v>

727
00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:06.800
<v Speaker 2>You can use the axioms to automatically </v>
<v Speaker 2>generate speech content.</v>

728
00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:07.813
<v Speaker 2>You don't even have to hear the person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can just predict what they're going </v>

729
00:42:10.251 --> 00:42:11.084
<v Speaker 2>to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that alleviates any </v>

730
00:42:12.531 --> 00:42:15.080
<v Speaker 2>responsibility whatsoever they have for </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>

731
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:16.063
<v Speaker 2>And it also allows them to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have full control and full </v>

732
00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:20.780
<v Speaker 2>knowledge over the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only for controlling,</v>

733
00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:21.633
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for all knowledge about the entire </v>

734
00:42:23.061 --> 00:42:23.894
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also the capacity to distinguish </v>

735
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:26.503
<v Speaker 2>without a moment's thought between those</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are on the side of the good and </v>

736
00:42:28.971 --> 00:42:29.804
<v Speaker 2>those who are not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's where the danger really </v>

737
00:42:31.371 --> 00:42:32.660
<v Speaker 2>comes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

738
00:42:32.661 --> 00:42:33.740
<v Speaker 2>we'll take a look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

739
00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:39.960
<v Speaker 4>so right now</v>
<v Speaker 4>the news is</v>

740
00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:47.650
<v Speaker 4>a person whose daughter</v>
<v Speaker 4>was a heroin addict.</v>

741
00:42:49.091 --> 00:42:52.870
<v Speaker 4>And I think what he said in his public </v>
<v Speaker 4>comments and he's pro bunker,</v>

742
00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:54.143
<v Speaker 4>he's probably cops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so he's the one getting interviewed </v>

743
00:42:56.831 --> 00:43:01.420
<v Speaker 4>and there were like a million people who</v>
<v Speaker 4>have spoken about how they've been,</v>

744
00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:02.740
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>abused by the cops,</v>

745
00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:04.890
<v Speaker 4>that they're not being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not being spoken to you.</v>

746
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:06.960
<v Speaker 4>I don't need the person who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>

747
00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:10.900

<v Speaker 4>So they got this and that's the one that</v>

748

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:26.450

00:47:36.671 --> 00:47:41.671
<v Speaker 5>we're disrupting being loud a crime</v>
<v Speaker 5>for herself.</v>

800
00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:45.660
<v Speaker 5>I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

801
00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:47.860
<v Speaker 5>you don't understand anything.</v>

802
00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:54.920
<v Speaker 1>So this got a lot of attention online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just so you know.</v>

803
00:47:54.921 --> 00:47:59.300
<v Speaker 1>And so then she responded because she </v>
<v Speaker 1>was quite intensely criticized.</v>

804
00:47:59.301 --> 00:48:00.134
<v Speaker 1>So here's her response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I want you to listen to how she </v>

805
00:48:02.001 --> 00:48:02.834
<v Speaker 1>speaks.</v>

806
00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:06.730
<v Speaker 4>My name is Anna and I'm doing this video</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we need to talk.</v>

807
00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:08.073
<v Speaker 4>It's become clear to me that a great </v>
<v Speaker 4>deal of us suffer from the illness of </v>

808
00:48:10.391 --> 00:48:12.820
<v Speaker 4>patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's not just the men who suffer.</v>

809
00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:14.800
<v Speaker 4>Women can be patriarchal too,</v>

810
00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:21.800
<v Speaker 6>really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But why would they be patriarchal?</v>

811
00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:26.210
<v Speaker 6>Tore to other women?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a stupid,</v>

812
00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:26.360
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

813
00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:29.690
<v Speaker 4>So many things in our system today come </v>
<v Speaker 4>from patriarchy,</v>

814
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:32.000
<v Speaker 4>including racism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>colonialism,</v>

815
00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:33.830
<v Speaker 4>capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>classism,</v>

816
00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:35.300
<v Speaker 4>and of course sex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

817
00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:39.110
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She thinks she knows everything.</v>

818
00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:40.123
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All these experts with our degrees can </v>

819
00:48:41.421 --> 00:48:45.110
<v Speaker 6>just go home.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One thing to remember though,</v>

820
00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:48.200
<v Speaker 6>it's hard to see something when we're </v>
<v Speaker 6>really close to it.</v>

821
00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:49.333
<v Speaker 6>You have to step back sometimes look at </v>
<v Speaker 6>a system critically to see what others </v>

822
00:48:53.031 --> 00:48:55.670
<v Speaker 6>might be seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if she's done.</v>

823
00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:00.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm a woman of color,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm going to talk about my experience</v>

824
00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:01.693
<v Speaker 4>that many other marginalized people such</v>
<v Speaker 4>as indigenous peoples and Queer and </v>

825
00:49:05.181 --> 00:49:08.390
<v Speaker 4>transgender people and gender </v>
<v Speaker 4>nonconforming people will have their own</v>

826
00:49:08.391 --> 00:49:09.710
<v Speaker 4>thoughts on this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Also</v>

827
00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:15.090
<v Speaker 6>indigenous who and what the hell is </v>
<v Speaker 6>gender nonconforming?</v>

828
00:49:15.371 --> 00:49:18.310
<v Speaker 6>What are all these labels?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is she even talking about?</v>

829
00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:21.280
<v Speaker 6>Why is this woman thinks she can speak </v>
<v Speaker 6>for everyone?</v>

830
00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:23.140
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who the hell is she anyways?</v>

831
00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:24.670
<v Speaker 6>What a drama queen</v>

832
00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:28.800
<v Speaker 4>challenge is that it is very hard for </v>
<v Speaker 4>those who are marginalized such as women</v>

833
00:49:28.801 --> 00:49:29.634
<v Speaker 4>of color to express how they feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>without being called the angry brown </v>

834
00:49:33.391 --> 00:49:36.840
<v Speaker 4>woman or the angry black woman or the </v>
<v Speaker 4>nagging woman.</v>

835
00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:38.540
<v Speaker 6>Oh crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My God,</v>

836
00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:39.383
<v Speaker 6>she just won't stop talking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But sometimes I do wonder what women of </v>

837
00:49:42.151 --> 00:49:45.150
<v Speaker 6>color thinking when I make a cross </v>
<v Speaker 6>racial or sexual joke in front of them.</v>

838
00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:46.920
<v Speaker 6>And then I say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just kidding.</v>

839
00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:49.620
<v Speaker 6>And then afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why do they always turn me down?</v>

840
00:49:49.621 --> 00:49:50.610
<v Speaker 6>When I asked him to dinner,</v>

841
00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:54.590
<v Speaker 4>it's because of a phenomenon called </v>
<v Speaker 4>white fragility and male fragility.</v>

842
00:49:55.310 --> 00:49:58.340
<v Speaker 4>White liberals and men in general have </v>
<v Speaker 4>been told over and over again,</v>

843
00:49:58.580 --> 00:49:59.413
<v Speaker 4>but if they just never used the n word </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they never talk about race and then </v>

844
00:50:01.811 --> 00:50:05.030
<v Speaker 4>never physically molest anyone and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not racist or sexist.</v>

845
00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:06.103
<v Speaker 4>So when I point out that actually the </v>
<v Speaker 4>system of power we live in ensures that </v>

846
00:50:09.411 --> 00:50:10.244
<v Speaker 4>all white people are racist and all men </v>
<v Speaker 4>are sexist because they profit from a </v>

847
00:50:14.001 --> 00:50:16.910
<v Speaker 4>system that marginalizes people of color</v>
<v Speaker 4>and non males.</v>

848
00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:18.133
<v Speaker 4>They attack me just as they've attacked </v>
<v Speaker 4>women of color for centuries to retain </v>

849
00:50:22.041 --> 00:50:23.060
<v Speaker 4>the power structure.</v>

850
00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:26.710
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she's the sexiest one.</v>

851
00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:28.320
<v Speaker 6>She's the racist more.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>

852
00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:30.610
<v Speaker 6>Why does she hate me?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

853
00:50:30.611 --> 00:50:31.444
<v Speaker 6>So I make more money because I'm a man </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I have a lot of privilege and my </v>

854
00:50:35.711 --> 00:50:39.490
<v Speaker 6>voice matters at every sphere of life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I didn't ask for that.</v>

855
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:40.833
<v Speaker 6>That doesn't make me racist or sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She talks as if men don't have any </v>

856
00:50:43.831 --> 00:50:46.500
<v Speaker 6>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I haven't had a raise in three years.</v>

857
00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:47.311
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

858
00:50:47.311 --> 00:50:48.144
<v Speaker 6>I haven't spoken up for women or done </v>
<v Speaker 6>anything constructive to help women or </v>

859
00:50:51.721 --> 00:50:52.554
<v Speaker 6>people of color and I take my privileges</v>
<v Speaker 6>without question and I live happily in </v>

860
00:50:57.301 --> 00:51:01.110
<v Speaker 6>my own little bubble,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that doesn't mean that I profit from</v>

861
00:51:01.111 --> 00:51:03.210
<v Speaker 6>their suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not my fault.</v>

862
00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:05.730
<v Speaker 6>They're marginalized.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't marginalize them,</v>

863
00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:08.280
<v Speaker 6>so why should I do anything to help </v>
<v Speaker 6>them?</v>

864
00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:09.503
<v Speaker 6>Just because I make more money,</v>
<v Speaker 6>have access to all the education and </v>

865
00:51:12.931 --> 00:51:15.300
<v Speaker 6>resources and housing and jobs.</v>

866
00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:18.603
<v Speaker 4>Recently I was sexually harassed by a </v>
<v Speaker 4>man in public on camera and the new </v>

867
00:51:22.891 --> 00:51:26.650
<v Speaker 4>stations posted the video without my </v>
<v Speaker 4>permission with the question,</v>

868
00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:32.010
<v Speaker 4>do you consider this sexual harassment?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This led to a lot of people attacking me</v>

869
00:51:32.081 --> 00:51:33.970
<v Speaker 4>and going off to me all over social </v>
<v Speaker 4>media.</v>

870
00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:38.470
<v Speaker 4>This is what patriarchy does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It causes everyone to attack the victim.</v>

871
00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:42.910
<v Speaker 4>The one who is most vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This protects the system of power,</v>

872
00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:44.073
<v Speaker 6>which is male sexual dominance.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How do we even know she's telling the </v>

873
00:51:47.231 --> 00:51:48.064
<v Speaker 6>truth about sex or harassment?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I saw that video and the online </v>

874
00:51:50.531 --> 00:51:51.364
<v Speaker 6>reactions from all the men and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they were threatening rape and violence </v>

875
00:51:55.210 --> 00:51:58.240
<v Speaker 6>and death all while accusing her of </v>
<v Speaker 6>overreacting.</v>

876
00:51:58.810 --> 00:51:59.643
<v Speaker 6>But just because she's putting her </v>
<v Speaker 6>physical safety on the line to talk </v>

877
00:52:01.991 --> 00:52:03.970
<v Speaker 6>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't mean she's right.</v>

878
00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:07.420
<v Speaker 4>The main complaint that I raised my </v>
<v Speaker 4>voice,</v>

879
00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:08.853
<v Speaker 4>they questioned my sanity because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>spoke up a patriarchal society wants </v>

880
00:52:13.210 --> 00:52:14.320
<v Speaker 4>women to shut up.</v>

881
00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:15.353
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now the next thing that happened was </v>

882
00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:18.533
<v Speaker 1>she started a funding campaign to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help her out and get her to spread </v>

883
00:52:22.021 --> 00:52:23.280
<v Speaker 1>her message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

884
00:52:23.281 --> 00:52:24.290
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

885
00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:29.130
<v Speaker 1>that was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what happened was this guy here</v>

886
00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:34.470
<v Speaker 1>decided that he was going to start a </v>
<v Speaker 1>funding campaign for humongous.</v>

887
00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:35.993
<v Speaker 1>And so he started a cam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a funding campaign on a website devoted </v>

888
00:52:39.421 --> 00:52:41.640
<v Speaker 1>to funding such projects and they shut </v>
<v Speaker 1>him down.</v>

889
00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:47.070
<v Speaker 1>So then he started another funding </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign and he raised $140,000.</v>

890
00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:50.430
<v Speaker 1>And so this is his interview with </v>
<v Speaker 1>humongous,</v>

891
00:52:50.530 --> 00:52:51.680
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let me turn up my mic,</v>

892
00:52:51.681 --> 00:52:53.780
<v Speaker 7>rudy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and let's see if that helps you.</v>

893
00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:56.930
<v Speaker 7>Is this better?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is that better?</v>

894
00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:58.370
<v Speaker 7>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>brother.</v>

895
00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:00.193
<v Speaker 7>So you said you were,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you were working this morning blowing </v>

896
00:53:02.181 --> 00:53:03.410
<v Speaker 7>leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

897
00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:04.253
<v Speaker 7>so I was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

898
00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:08.030
<v Speaker 7>in downtown Bellevue and Seattle blowing</v>
<v Speaker 7>what us,</v>

899
00:53:08.330 --> 00:53:10.490
<v Speaker 7>what a salt of the earth man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

900
00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:12.173
<v Speaker 7>Jessica pledge $130,000.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And he's out there blown some fucking </v>

901
00:53:15.771 --> 00:53:18.050
<v Speaker 7>leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Y'All can learn something from your boy.</v>

902
00:53:18.051 --> 00:53:19.640
<v Speaker 7>Humongous here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>God Damn,</v>

903
00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:21.410
<v Speaker 7>you don't look,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we got a new president.</v>

904
00:53:21.411 --> 00:53:25.260
<v Speaker 7>But that didn't mean that the leaves </v>
<v Speaker 7>don't need to be still picked up.</v>

905
00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:27.540
<v Speaker 7>Rudy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how are you feeling right now?</v>

906
00:53:27.541 --> 00:53:29.400
<v Speaker 7>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I feel loved.</v>

907
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:31.710
<v Speaker 7>I am really,</v>
<v Speaker 7>truly grateful.</v>

908
00:53:31.711 --> 00:53:32.544
<v Speaker 7>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not last weekend I was little trogger </v>

909
00:53:35.911 --> 00:53:38.620
<v Speaker 7>and broke down.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Ready for your eviction.</v>

910
00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:43.050
<v Speaker 7>I'm looking out at the sky and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 7>thinking,</v>

911
00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:45.860
<v Speaker 7>I think I'm kind of screwed today,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>

912
00:53:46.090 --> 00:53:50.880
<v Speaker 7>So I took myself down to a church and I </v>
<v Speaker 7>went and prayed.</v>

913
00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:52.373
<v Speaker 7>I went and did confession,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but my confession didn't meet the </v>

914
00:53:54.241 --> 00:53:57.660

1007
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:18.583
<v Speaker 1>so this is from the Gulag archipelago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of my informants has told me how </v>

1008
00:58:22.281 --> 00:58:26.690
<v Speaker 1>executions were carried out at a deck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a camp on the pitcher river.</v>

1009
00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:28.873
<v Speaker 1>They would take the opposition members </v>
<v Speaker 1>with their things out of the camp </v>

1010
00:58:32.661 --> 00:58:33.494
<v Speaker 1>compound on prisoner transport at night </v>
<v Speaker 1>and outside the camp pound stood the </v>

1011
00:58:36.831 --> 00:58:37.664
<v Speaker 1>small house of the third section,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the condemned man or taken into a room </v>

1012
00:58:41.511 --> 00:58:44.720
<v Speaker 1>one at a time and they're the camp get </v>
<v Speaker 1>guards sprang on them.</v>

1013
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:45.703
<v Speaker 1>Their mouths were stuffed with something</v>
<v Speaker 1>soft and their arms were bound with </v>

1014
00:58:49.431 --> 00:58:50.264
<v Speaker 1>cords behind their backs and see these </v>
<v Speaker 1>were political prisoners who oppose the </v>

1015
00:58:53.181 --> 00:58:55.430
<v Speaker 1>Soviet system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the condemned man.</v>

1016
00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:56.563
<v Speaker 1>Then they were led out into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>courtyard where harnessed carts were </v>

1017
00:58:58.581 --> 00:58:59.414
<v Speaker 1>waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bound prisoners were piled on the </v>

1018
00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:05.360
<v Speaker 1>carts from five to seven at a time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>driven off to the Gorkha,</v>

1019
00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:06.463
<v Speaker 1>the camp cemetery on arrival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were tipped into big pits that had </v>

1020
00:59:09.801 --> 00:59:12.440
<v Speaker 1>already been prepared and buried alive,</v>

1021
00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:17.070
<v Speaker 1>not out of brutality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1022
00:59:17.730 --> 00:59:21.590
<v Speaker 1>it had been ascertained that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>dragging and them,</v>

1023
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:25.100
<v Speaker 1>it was much easier to cope with living </v>
<v Speaker 1>people then with corpses.</v>

1024
00:59:25.450 --> 00:59:26.283
<v Speaker 1>The work went on for many nights at Atac</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is how are the moral political </v>

1025
00:59:30.771 --> 00:59:35.771
<v Speaker 1>unity of our party was achieved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is from Viktor Frankl,</v>

1026
00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:40.340
<v Speaker 1>from his experiences in the Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration camps.</v>

1027
00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:45.820
<v Speaker 1>The most ghastly moment of the 24 hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>of camp life was the awakening when at a</v>

1028
00:59:46.881 --> 00:59:47.714
<v Speaker 1>still nocturnal hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The three shrill blows of a whistle </v>

1029
00:59:50.271 --> 00:59:51.104
<v Speaker 1>Taurus pity leslie from are exhausted </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep and from the longings in our </v>

1030
00:59:54.561 --> 00:59:55.394
<v Speaker 1>dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We then began the tussle with our wet </v>

1031
00:59:56.911 --> 01:00:00.050
<v Speaker 1>shoes into which we could scarcely force</v>
<v Speaker 1>our feet,</v>

1032
01:00:00.051 --> 01:00:00.884
<v Speaker 1>which were swollen and sore with edema </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there were the usual moans and </v>

1033
01:00:04.791 --> 01:00:05.624
<v Speaker 1>groans about petty troubles such as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>snapping of wires which replaced shoe </v>

1034
01:00:10.221 --> 01:00:11.054
<v Speaker 1>laces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one morning I heard someone whom I </v>

1035
01:00:12.711 --> 01:00:13.544
<v Speaker 1>knew to be brave and dignified cry like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a child because he finally had to go to </v>

1036
01:00:17.571 --> 01:00:20.540
<v Speaker 1>the snowy marching grounds in his bare </v>
<v Speaker 1>feet</v>

1037
01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:27.140
<v Speaker 1>as his shoes were too shrunk and for him</v>
<v Speaker 1>to wear in those ghastly moments,</v>

1038
01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:28.493
<v Speaker 1>I found a little bit of comfort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a small piece of bread which I drew out </v>

1039
01:00:31.771 --> 01:00:34.620
<v Speaker 1>of my pocket and munched with absorbed </v>
<v Speaker 1>delight</v>

1040
01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:42.840
<v Speaker 1>from Solzhenitsyn</v>
<v Speaker 1>in cold lower than 60 degrees below zero</v>

1041
01:00:45.930 --> 01:00:48.090
<v Speaker 1>work days were written off.</v>

1042
01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:51.090
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on such days,</v>

1043
01:00:51.091 --> 01:00:51.924
<v Speaker 1>the records showed that the workers had </v>
<v Speaker 1>not gone out to work because 60 below </v>

1044
01:00:55.711 --> 01:00:56.544
<v Speaker 1>was the cutoff for work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they chased them out anyways and </v>

1045
01:00:59.401 --> 01:01:02.730
<v Speaker 1>whatever they squeezed out of them on </v>
<v Speaker 1>those days was added to the other days.</v>

1046
01:01:02.850 --> 01:01:07.850
<v Speaker 1>Thereby raising the percentages and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>survival medical section wrote off those</v>

1047
01:01:08.821 --> 01:01:09.654
<v Speaker 1>who froze to death on such cool days on </v>
<v Speaker 1>some other basis and the ones who were </v>

1048
01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:13.794
<v Speaker 1>left who could no longer walk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>restraining every sinew to crawl along </v>

1049
01:01:18.181 --> 01:01:19.014
<v Speaker 1>on all fours on the way back to camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the convoy simply shot so that they </v>

1050
01:01:23.251 --> 01:01:25.890
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't escape before they could come </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to get them.</v>

1051
01:01:28.590 --> 01:01:33.050
<v Speaker 1>This is from William Blake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh rose,</v>

1052
01:01:33.170 --> 01:01:34.003
<v Speaker 1>thou art sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The invisible worm that flies in the </v>

1053
01:01:37.761 --> 01:01:38.594
<v Speaker 1>night in the howling storm at found out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>died bad of crimson joy and his dark </v>

1054
01:01:43.611 --> 01:01:45.920
<v Speaker 1>secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love does die.</v>

1055
01:01:45.921 --> 01:01:46.754
<v Speaker 1>Life Destroy</v>
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn Mac Beth self </v>

1056
01:01:51.921 --> 01:01:56.921
<v Speaker 1>justifications for his murders were </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeble and his conscience devoured him.</v>

1057
01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:58.633
<v Speaker 1>Even I ego was a little lamb to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination and spiritual strength of </v>

1058
01:02:02.121 --> 01:02:05.510
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare's evildoers stopped short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a dozen corpses.</v>

1059
01:02:05.810 --> 01:02:07.760
<v Speaker 1>That was because they add no ideology</v>

1060
01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:10.143
<v Speaker 1>ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is what gives evil doing its long </v>

1061
01:02:12.971 --> 01:02:13.804
<v Speaker 1>sought justification and gives the evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>doer that necessary steadfastness and </v>

1062
01:02:18.371 --> 01:02:23.250
<v Speaker 1>determination</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the social theory which helps to</v>

1063
01:02:23.251 --> 01:02:24.084
<v Speaker 1>make this act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His Act seemed good instead of bad in </v>

1064
01:02:26.791 --> 01:02:27.624
<v Speaker 1>his own and other's eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was how the agents of the </v>

1065
01:02:29.131 --> 01:02:32.460
<v Speaker 1>inquisition fortified their wills by </v>
<v Speaker 1>invoking Christianity.</v>

1066
01:02:32.610 --> 01:02:33.443
<v Speaker 1>The conqueror is a foreign lands by </v>
<v Speaker 1>extolling the grand year of their </v>

1067
01:02:35.971 --> 01:02:38.460
<v Speaker 1>motherland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the colonizers by civilization,</v>

1068
01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:42.480
<v Speaker 1>the Nazis by race and the Jacobins early</v>
<v Speaker 1>and late by equality,</v>

1069
01:02:42.481 --> 01:02:45.330
<v Speaker 1>brotherhood and the happiness of future </v>
<v Speaker 1>generations.</v>

1070
01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:48.390
<v Speaker 1>Without evildoers there would have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>new archipelago,</v>

1071
01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:54.170
<v Speaker 1>fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire</v>

1072
01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.130
<v Speaker 1>branches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crackle,</v>

1073
01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:02.230
<v Speaker 1>and the night wind of late autumn blows </v>
<v Speaker 1>the flame of the bonfire back and forth.</v>

1074
01:03:02.770 --> 01:03:06.670
<v Speaker 1>The compound is dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm alone at the bonfire and I can bring</v>

1075
01:03:06.671 --> 01:03:10.520
<v Speaker 1>it still some more carpenter shavings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The compound here is a privileged one,</v>

1076
01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:14.620
<v Speaker 1>so privileged that it is almost as if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>were out in freedom.</v>

1077
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:19.480
<v Speaker 1>This is an island of paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the Marfino [inaudible],</v>

1078
01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:20.463
<v Speaker 1>a scientific institutes staffed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>prisoners and its most privileged </v>

1079
01:03:23.951 --> 01:03:25.750
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one is overseeing me,</v>

1080
01:03:25.870 --> 01:03:29.410
<v Speaker 1>calling me to a sale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chasing me away from the bonfire.</v>

1081
01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:32.380
<v Speaker 1>And even then it is chilly in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>penetrating wind,</v>

1082
01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:37.450
<v Speaker 1>but she who has already been standing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wind for hours,</v>

1083
01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:40.210
<v Speaker 1>her arms straight down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her head drooping,</v>

1084
01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:43.360
<v Speaker 1>weeping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then growing numb and still,</v>

1085
01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:46.630
<v Speaker 1>and then again she begs pity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asley citizen chief,</v>

1086
01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:50.620
<v Speaker 1>please forgive me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will do it again.</v>

1087
01:03:51.610 --> 01:03:55.870
<v Speaker 1>The wind carries her moan to me just as </v>
<v Speaker 1>if she were moaning next to my ear.</v>

1088
01:03:56.170 --> 01:04:01.170
<v Speaker 1>The citizen chief of the gate house </v>
<v Speaker 1>fires up his stove and does not answer.</v>

1089
01:04:02.290 --> 01:04:03.123
<v Speaker 1>This was the gate house of the camp next</v>
<v Speaker 1>to us from which workers came into our </v>

1090
01:04:06.941 --> 01:04:07.774
<v Speaker 1>compound to lay water pipes into repair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The old ramshackle seminary building </v>

1091
01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:13.743
<v Speaker 1>cross for me beyond the artfully </v>
<v Speaker 1>intertwined many stranded barbed wire </v>

1092
01:04:17.771 --> 01:04:18.604
<v Speaker 1>barricade and two steps away from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gate house beneath the bright lantern </v>

1093
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:27.630
<v Speaker 1>stood the punished girl head hanging the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wind tugging at her gray work skirt,</v>

1094
01:04:29.770 --> 01:04:33.970
<v Speaker 1>her feet growing numb from the cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thin scarf over her head.</v>

1095
01:04:34.810 --> 01:04:35.643
<v Speaker 1>It had been warm during the day when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they had been digging a ditch on our </v>

1096
01:04:38.051 --> 01:04:43.051
<v Speaker 1>territory and another girl slipping down</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a ravine had crawled her way to the</v>

1097
01:04:44.141 --> 01:04:44.974
<v Speaker 1>Vladi Keno highway and escaped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guard had bungled and Moscow city </v>

1098
01:04:49.091 --> 01:04:51.760
<v Speaker 1>buses ran right along the highway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they call it on,</v>

1099
01:04:51.761 --> 01:04:55.360
<v Speaker 1>it was too late to catch her and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>raised the alarm.</v>

1100
01:04:55.990 --> 01:05:00.990
<v Speaker 1>Amine dark major arrived and shouted </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if they failed to catch the girl,</v>

1101
01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:06.460
<v Speaker 1>the entire camp would be deprived visits</v>
<v Speaker 1>and parcels for a whole month because of</v>

1102
01:05:06.461 --> 01:05:07.294
<v Speaker 1>her escape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the woman brigadiers went into a </v>

1103
01:05:10.541 --> 01:05:11.374
<v Speaker 1>rage and they were all shouting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them in particular who kept </v>

1104
01:05:14.141 --> 01:05:16.900
<v Speaker 1>viciously rolling her eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1105
01:05:16.901 --> 01:05:18.280
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they capture the bitch.</v>

1106
01:05:18.281 --> 01:05:21.130
<v Speaker 1>I hope they take scissors and clip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clip,</v>

1107
01:05:21.131 --> 01:05:21.964
<v Speaker 1>clip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take off all her hair in front of the </v>

1108
01:05:23.561 --> 01:05:26.860
<v Speaker 1>lineup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This wasn't something she had thought up</v>

1109
01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:27.753
<v Speaker 1>herself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was the way they punished women in </v>

1110
01:05:29.291 --> 01:05:30.124
<v Speaker 1>the ghoulag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the girl who was now standing </v>

1111
01:05:32.501 --> 01:05:36.460
<v Speaker 1>outside the gate house in the cold had </v>
<v Speaker 1>sighed and said instead,</v>

1112
01:05:37.810 --> 01:05:41.530
<v Speaker 1>at least she can have a good time out in</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom for all of us.</v>

1113
01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:46.270
<v Speaker 1>The jailer overheard what she had said </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was now being punished.</v>

1114
01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:48.820
<v Speaker 1>Everyone else had been taken off to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>camp,</v>

1115
01:05:49.030 --> 01:05:49.863
<v Speaker 1>but she had been set outside there to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand at attention in front of the gate </v>

1116
01:05:53.871 --> 01:05:54.430
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

1117
01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:57.970
<v Speaker 1>This had been at 6:00 PM and now it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>11:00 PM</v>

1118
01:05:59.470 --> 01:06:01.330
<v Speaker 1>she tried to shift from one foot to </v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

1119
01:06:01.331 --> 01:06:03.100
<v Speaker 1>but the guards stuck out his head and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouted,</v>

1120
01:06:03.101 --> 01:06:06.910
<v Speaker 1>stand at attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whore or else it will be worse for you,</v>

1121
01:06:07.830 --> 01:06:10.990
<v Speaker 1>and now she was not moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only weeping.</v>

1122
01:06:12.250 --> 01:06:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Forgive me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>citizen chief,</v>

1123
01:06:13.601 --> 01:06:17.290
<v Speaker 1>let me into the camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't do it anymore,</v>

1124
01:06:19.210 --> 01:06:22.690
<v Speaker 1>but even in the camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one was about to say to her,</v>

1125
01:06:23.130 --> 01:06:24.070
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>idiot,</v>

1126
01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:25.513
<v Speaker 1>come on in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason they were keeping her out </v>

1127
01:06:27.851 --> 01:06:28.684
<v Speaker 1>there for so long with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next day was Sunday and she would </v>

1128
01:06:31.511 --> 01:06:35.470
<v Speaker 1>not be needed for work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Such a straw,</v>

1129
01:06:35.471 --> 01:06:36.910
<v Speaker 1>blonde,</v>
<v Speaker 1>naive,</v>

1130
01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:38.313
<v Speaker 1>uneducated slip of a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'd been imprisoned for some spool of </v>

1131
01:06:42.461 --> 01:06:45.670
<v Speaker 1>thread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a dangerous thought.</v>

1132
01:06:45.671 --> 01:06:46.504
<v Speaker 1>You express their little sister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to teach you a lesson for the </v>

1133
01:06:49.301 --> 01:06:52.180
<v Speaker 1>rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fire,</v>

1134
01:06:53.350 --> 01:06:58.350
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We fought the war and we looked into the</v>

1135
01:06:58.571 --> 01:07:01.360
<v Speaker 1>bonfires to see what kind of victory it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be.</v>

1136
01:07:02.890 --> 01:07:06.130
<v Speaker 1>The wind wafted a glowing husk from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bonfire</v>

1137
01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:11.570
<v Speaker 1>to that flame and new girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I promise the whole wide world will read</v>

1138
01:07:11.571 --> 01:07:12.404
<v Speaker 1>about you.</v>

1139
01:07:14.590 --> 01:07:15.423
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1140
01:07:15.590 --> 01:07:18.260
<v Speaker 1>This is from John Milton from paradise </v>
<v Speaker 1>lost</v>

1141
01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:22.853
<v Speaker 1>for wince,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but from the author of all ill could </v>

1142
01:07:27.481 --> 01:07:31.800
<v Speaker 1>spring so deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a malice to confound the race of mankind</v>

1143
01:07:31.801 --> 01:07:36.801
<v Speaker 1>in one route and earth with hell to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mingle and involve done all to spite the</v>

1144
01:07:38.071 --> 01:07:43.071
<v Speaker 1>great creator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shall despair.</v>

1145
01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:46.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1146
01:07:46.610 --> 01:07:48.830
<v Speaker 1>there is no creature loves me and if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>die,</v>

1147
01:07:48.831 --> 01:07:50.690
<v Speaker 1>no soul will pity me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nay.</v>

1148
01:07:50.691 --> 01:07:53.690
<v Speaker 1>Wherefore should day since that I myself</v>
<v Speaker 1>find it in myself,</v>

1149
01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:58.440
<v Speaker 1>no pity to myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Shakespeare</v>

1150
01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:01.983
<v Speaker 1>soldier knits and describes his </v>
<v Speaker 1>reactions and actions of staunch </v>

1151
01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:05.163
<v Speaker 1>Communist Party members imprisoned and </v>
<v Speaker 1>devoured by the system and they support </v>

1152
01:08:08.451 --> 01:08:13.451
<v Speaker 1>it and produced frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The camp system vacuumed people up.</v>

1153
01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:15.423
<v Speaker 1>Really any concern whatsoever for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>niceties of individual guilt or </v>

1154
01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:21.313
<v Speaker 1>innocence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as Stellan and his henchmen were </v>

1155
01:08:23.721 --> 01:08:24.554
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was probably something that you </v>

1156
01:08:25.921 --> 01:08:26.754
<v Speaker 1>were guilty about at some point in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>past and there were no shortage of </v>

1157
01:08:29.481 --> 01:08:32.750
<v Speaker 1>people to inform on you regardless of </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you had done anything.</v>

1158
01:08:32.751 --> 01:08:36.080
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that used to happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the collective apartment buildings of</v>

1159
01:08:36.081 --> 01:08:39.620
<v Speaker 1>which there were nowhere near enough of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so multiple families would end up living</v>

1160
01:08:39.621 --> 01:08:42.020
<v Speaker 1>in the same tiny apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1161
01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:46.310
<v Speaker 1>was that if you could inform on someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the hall who,</v>

1162
01:08:46.610 --> 01:08:47.443
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe refused to return the quarter cup </v>

1163
01:08:49.341 --> 01:08:51.530
<v Speaker 1>of salt you had lent them or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1164
01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:52.513
<v Speaker 1>If you would inform on them and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>family would be carted away to the </v>

1165
01:08:55.371 --> 01:08:58.460
<v Speaker 1>concentration camp system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you got to have their apartment.</v>

1166
01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:02.210
<v Speaker 1>And so in East Germany at the height of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet system,</v>

1167
01:09:02.211 --> 01:09:03.044
<v Speaker 1>one out of three people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one out of every three people was a </v>

1168
01:09:04.821 --> 01:09:08.090
<v Speaker 1>government informer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that meant if you had a family of</v>

1169
01:09:08.091 --> 01:09:10.670
<v Speaker 1>six people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were two people in every room that</v>

1170
01:09:10.671 --> 01:09:11.504
<v Speaker 1>you were ever in who are ready to say to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the authorities anything you ever had </v>

1171
01:09:14.991 --> 01:09:15.824
<v Speaker 1>the temerity to speak and perhaps to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell them all sorts of things that you </v>

1172
01:09:18.681 --> 01:09:22.190
<v Speaker 1>didn't even do because there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>requirement if you are in former,</v>

1173
01:09:22.191 --> 01:09:25.820
<v Speaker 1>to ensure that you had something to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>every time you came into inform.</v>

1174
01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:30.253
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't matter if you were a devout </v>

1175
01:09:31.191 --> 01:09:32.024
<v Speaker 1>communist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because from time to time your door </v>

1176
01:09:33.951 --> 01:09:34.784
<v Speaker 1>would be kicked down at 3:00 AM in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning and people would come in with </v>

1177
01:09:36.591 --> 01:09:37.424
<v Speaker 1>Jack boots and get you dressed as </v>
<v Speaker 1>rapidly as they possibly could and take </v>

1178
01:09:40.461 --> 01:09:42.920
<v Speaker 1>you away when you were still half awake </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>

1179
01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:43.873
<v Speaker 1>to the prison in the middle of the city </v>
<v Speaker 1>and strip you of your clothes and give </v>

1180
01:09:46.431 --> 01:09:49.700
<v Speaker 1>you things that didn't fit and shave </v>
<v Speaker 1>your head and take you off to a camp and</v>

1181
01:09:49.701 --> 01:09:51.380
<v Speaker 1>you'd never get to see your family </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

1182
01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:52.513
<v Speaker 1>And that happened to millions of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it happened to staunch communists </v>

1183
01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:58.820
<v Speaker 1>just like it happened to people who in </v>
<v Speaker 1>principle,</v>

1184
01:09:58.821 --> 01:09:59.654
<v Speaker 1>we're opposed to the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Solzhenitsyn thought that the </v>

1185
01:10:01.641 --> 01:10:04.880
<v Speaker 1>staunch communist party members who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>thrown into the camps had the worst time</v>

1186
01:10:04.881 --> 01:10:05.714
<v Speaker 1>of edit of everyone because the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who'd already decided that the system </v>

1187
01:10:08.961 --> 01:10:11.120
<v Speaker 1>was corrupt weren't really surprised </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it happened,</v>

1188
01:10:11.121 --> 01:10:12.380
<v Speaker 1>even though it was still terrible.</v>

1189
01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:15.680
<v Speaker 1>But the Communist Party members had </v>
<v Speaker 1>given their whole life to the system and</v>

1190
01:10:15.681 --> 01:10:17.540
<v Speaker 1>then they were picked up just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone else.</v>

1191
01:10:17.541 --> 01:10:20.990
<v Speaker 1>And he had a very hard time with them </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they came to prison because most of</v>

1192
01:10:20.991 --> 01:10:24.290
<v Speaker 1>them assumed that a terrible mistake had</v>
<v Speaker 1>been made.</v>

1193
01:10:24.291 --> 01:10:26.150
<v Speaker 1>And that if they just wrote the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1194
01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:29.180
<v Speaker 1>and con contacted their former friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>who would know,</v>

1195
01:10:29.181 --> 01:10:30.620
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have nothing to do with them,</v>

1196
01:10:30.890 --> 01:10:33.890
<v Speaker 1>that the error would be rectified in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>soon would be released.</v>

1197
01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:34.753
<v Speaker 1>So they also assumed that everyone else </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the camps was completely guilty and </v>

1198
01:10:38.211 --> 01:10:39.044
<v Speaker 1>was there for good reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise the beloved party </v>

1199
01:10:40.911 --> 01:10:41.744
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have put them there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for some reason they had been in </v>

1200
01:10:43.761 --> 01:10:47.560
<v Speaker 1>prison because they were innocent </v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that they were innocent</v>

1201
01:10:47.561 --> 01:10:48.394
<v Speaker 1>and soldiers [inaudible] and his friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to play a game with people like </v>

1202
01:10:51.441 --> 01:10:52.274
<v Speaker 1>that because he didn't exactly know how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to treat them because on the one hand </v>

1203
01:10:54.710 --> 01:10:56.030
<v Speaker 1>they were victims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly.</v>

1204
01:10:56.030 --> 01:10:57.230
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand,</v>

1205
01:10:57.231 --> 01:10:58.064
<v Speaker 1>they were part of the system that had </v>
<v Speaker 1>perpetrated precisely the horrors that </v>

1206
01:11:00.861 --> 01:11:01.694
<v Speaker 1>were visited on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when they first came in and were </v>

1207
01:11:03.831 --> 01:11:08.660
<v Speaker 1>still chalked full of communist Dogma </v>
<v Speaker 1>and totalitarian thought and judgemental</v>

1208
01:11:08.661 --> 01:11:09.494
<v Speaker 1>in every possible way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and his friends would have fun </v>

1209
01:11:11.331 --> 01:11:12.164
<v Speaker 1>pointing out all the shortages and </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophes of the Soviet system and </v>

1210
01:11:15.241 --> 01:11:20.241
<v Speaker 1>then let them run through their </v>
<v Speaker 1>algorithmic ideology and until the point</v>

1211
01:11:20.251 --> 01:11:21.084
<v Speaker 1>of absurdity and then really not spend </v>
<v Speaker 1>much time communicating with them until </v>

1212
01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:25.013
<v Speaker 1>they broke down and decided that things </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't so good for them or everybody </v>

1213
01:11:29.131 --> 01:11:29.964
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And more or less entered the common run </v>

1214
01:11:32.071 --> 01:11:37.071
<v Speaker 1>of humanity once again</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say that things were hard for them is</v>

1215
01:11:39.661 --> 01:11:43.110
<v Speaker 1>to say almost nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were incapable of assimilating such</v>

1216
01:11:43.111 --> 01:11:44.940
<v Speaker 1>a blow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a downfall,</v>

1217
01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:50.480
<v Speaker 1>and from their own people to from their </v>
<v Speaker 1>only dear party and from all appearances</v>

1218
01:11:50.671 --> 01:11:52.500
<v Speaker 1>for nothing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>

1219
01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:55.920
<v Speaker 1>they'd been guilty of nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as the party was concerned,</v>

1220
01:11:56.850 --> 01:12:01.850
<v Speaker 1>nothing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was painful for them to such a degree</v>

1221
01:12:02.161 --> 01:12:06.270
<v Speaker 1>that it was considered taboo among them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and comradely task.</v>

1222
01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:07.193
<v Speaker 1>What were you in prison for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only squeamish generation of </v>

1223
01:12:09.781 --> 01:12:12.210
<v Speaker 1>prisoners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rest of us with tongues hanging out.</v>

1224
01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:13.193
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't wait to tell the story to every</v>
<v Speaker 1>chance newcomer we met and to the whole </v>

1225
01:12:16.861 --> 01:12:19.560
<v Speaker 1>cell as if it were an anecdote.</v>

1226
01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:21.140
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1227
01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:24.250
<v Speaker 1>Here is the sort of people they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>Olga sleazy,</v>

1228
01:12:24.251 --> 01:12:25.084
<v Speaker 1>Oseberg's husband had already been </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrested and they had come to carry out </v>

1229
01:12:28.601 --> 01:12:29.434
<v Speaker 1>a search and arrest her too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The search lasted for hours and she </v>

1230
01:12:33.341 --> 01:12:34.174
<v Speaker 1>spent those remaining four hours sorting</v>
<v Speaker 1>out the minutes of the congress of </v>

1231
01:12:38.321 --> 01:12:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Staccato vites of the bristle and brush </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry,</v>

1232
01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:44.560
<v Speaker 1>of which she had been secretary until </v>
<v Speaker 1>the previous day.</v>

1233
01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:45.813
<v Speaker 1>The incomplete state of the minute </v>
<v Speaker 1>troubled her more than her children who </v>

1234
01:12:50.351 --> 01:12:51.184
<v Speaker 1>she was now leaving forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the interrogator conducting the </v>

1235
01:12:53.711 --> 01:12:57.280
<v Speaker 1>search could not resist telling her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on now,</v>

1236
01:12:58.090 --> 01:13:03.040
<v Speaker 1>say farewell to your children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the sort of people they were</v>

1237
01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:05.493
<v Speaker 1>a letter from her 15 year old daughter </v>
<v Speaker 1>came to yell is a veta set cova and the </v>

1238
01:13:10.871 --> 01:13:14.560
<v Speaker 1>cows and prison for long term prisoners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mama,</v>

1239
01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:15.730
<v Speaker 1>tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write to me.</v>

1240
01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:20.500
<v Speaker 1>Are you guilty or not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope you weren't guilty because then I</v>

1241
01:13:20.501 --> 01:13:21.334
<v Speaker 1>won't join the Komsomol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was the Soviet youth </v>

1242
01:13:24.370 --> 01:13:25.203
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't join the Komsomol and I won't </v>

1243
01:13:27.461 --> 01:13:30.310
<v Speaker 1>forgive them because of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you are guilty,</v>

1244
01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:33.130
<v Speaker 1>I won't write you any more and I will </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate you.</v>

1245
01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:36.793
<v Speaker 1>And the mother was stricken by remorse </v>
<v Speaker 1>in her damp grave like cell with it's </v>

1246
01:13:40.611 --> 01:13:41.444
<v Speaker 1>dim little lamp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could her daughter live without the </v>

1247
01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:44.813
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]?</v>

1248
01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:48.630
<v Speaker 1>How could she be permitted to hate </v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet power?</v>

1249
01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Better that she should hate me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she wrote,</v>

1250
01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:54.270
<v Speaker 1>I am guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enter the Komsomol.</v>

1251
01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:56.273
<v Speaker 1>How could it be anything but hard?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was more than the human heart could </v>

1252
01:13:59.251 --> 01:14:04.251
<v Speaker 1>bear to fall beneath the beloved acts </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then have to justify its wisdom.</v>

1253
01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:07.830
<v Speaker 1>But that is the price a man pays for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

1254
01:14:07.831 --> 01:14:12.190
<v Speaker 1>His God given sole to human dogma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even today,</v>

1255
01:14:12.191 --> 01:14:17.191
<v Speaker 1>any orthodox communist will affirm that </v>
<v Speaker 1>set Cova acted correctly even today.</v>

1256
01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:19.593
<v Speaker 1>They cannot be convinced that it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is precisely the perversion of </v>

1257
01:14:23.441 --> 01:14:28.000
<v Speaker 1>small forces that the mother perverted </v>
<v Speaker 1>her daughter and harmed her soul.</v>

1258
01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:29.013
<v Speaker 1>Here's the sort of people they were yt </v>
<v Speaker 1>gave sincere testimony against her </v>

1259
01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:35.080
<v Speaker 1>husband,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything to aid the party.</v>

1260
01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:37.383
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how one could pity them if at least now </v>

1261
01:14:40.071 --> 01:14:43.570
<v Speaker 1>they had come to comprehend their former</v>
<v Speaker 1>wretchedness.</v>

1262
01:14:43.690 --> 01:14:44.523
<v Speaker 1>This whole chapter could have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>written quite differently if today they </v>

1263
01:14:46.811 --> 01:14:49.240
<v Speaker 1>had at least forsaken their earlier </v>
<v Speaker 1>views,</v>

1264
01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:53.410
<v Speaker 1>but it happened the way Marea Daniel and</v>
<v Speaker 1>had dreamed it would.</v>

1265
01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:55.323
<v Speaker 1>If I leave here someday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to live as if nothing had </v>

1266
01:14:58.871 --> 01:15:03.010
<v Speaker 1>taken place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Loyalty in our view,</v>

1267
01:15:03.011 --> 01:15:03.844
<v Speaker 1>it is just plain pigheadedness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These devote to the theory of </v>

1268
01:15:07.751 --> 01:15:11.650
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>construed loyalty to that development to</v>

1269
01:15:11.651 --> 01:15:14.560
<v Speaker 1>mean renunciation of any personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>development whatsoever.</v>

1270
01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:18.190
<v Speaker 1>As Nikolai Adamovich villain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chuck said,</v>

1271
01:15:18.191 --> 01:15:23.191
<v Speaker 1>after serving 17 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we believed in the party and we were not</v>

1272
01:15:24.101 --> 01:15:28.690
<v Speaker 1>mistaken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this loyalty or pigheadedness?</v>

1273
01:15:29.050 --> 01:15:29.883
<v Speaker 1>It was not for show and not out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypocrisy that they argued in the cells </v>

1274
01:15:33.010 --> 01:15:34.840
<v Speaker 1>in defense of all the government's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actions.</v>

1275
01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:35.793
<v Speaker 1>They needed idiot logical arguments in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order in order to hold onto a sense of </v>

1276
01:15:39.911 --> 01:15:43.450
<v Speaker 1>their own rightness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise insanity.</v>

1277
01:15:43.451 --> 01:15:46.870
<v Speaker 1>It was not far off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you a story.</v>

1278
01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:52.370
<v Speaker 1>It was a story in genesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the last story in genesis.</v>

1279
01:15:52.371 --> 01:15:54.620
<v Speaker 1>It's called the Tower of Babel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a store,</v>

1280
01:15:54.621 --> 01:15:55.454
<v Speaker 1>very story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>short story and it occurs after the </v>

1281
01:15:57.951 --> 01:16:02.951
<v Speaker 1>story of Noah and the flood</v>
<v Speaker 1>flood stories by the way,</v>

1282
01:16:03.381 --> 01:16:04.214
<v Speaker 1>or</v>

1283
01:16:04.990 --> 01:16:05.823
<v Speaker 1>universally distributed except among </v>
<v Speaker 1>desert dwellers who have no experience </v>

1284
01:16:10.150 --> 01:16:10.983
<v Speaker 1>on which to hang the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Murcia Eliana who wrote a great </v>

1285
01:16:14.381 --> 01:16:16.960
<v Speaker 1>series of books called the history of </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious ideas,</v>

1286
01:16:17.230 --> 01:16:21.120
<v Speaker 1>documented the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

1287
01:16:21.450 --> 01:16:23.610
<v Speaker 1>the central narrative structure of flood</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

1288
01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:29.260
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>human settlement and it's washed away by</v>

1289
01:16:29.581 --> 01:16:32.580
<v Speaker 1>a flood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the flood is generally envisioned as</v>

1290
01:16:32.610 --> 01:16:37.320
<v Speaker 1>a consequence of God's judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that the,</v>

1291
01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:38.333
<v Speaker 1>if you take the flood stories that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>distributed worldwide and you boil them </v>

1292
01:16:40.951 --> 01:16:43.770
<v Speaker 1>down to pull out their architect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypal substructure,</v>

1293
01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:47.130
<v Speaker 1>you'll find that there are fundamentally</v>
<v Speaker 1>two reasons that a flood,</v>

1294
01:16:47.131 --> 01:16:48.570
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>curves and Elliot,</v>

1295
01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:51.690
<v Speaker 1>it says that it's the tendency of things</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fall apart,</v>

1296
01:16:53.010 --> 01:16:55.740
<v Speaker 1>combined with the proclivity of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings to sin.</v>

1297
01:16:56.370 --> 01:16:58.500
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it means something.</v>

1298
01:16:58.501 --> 01:16:59.760
<v Speaker 1>This means something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so,</v>

1299
01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:01.530
<v Speaker 1>it means that</v>

1300
01:17:03.790 --> 01:17:06.220
<v Speaker 1>everything is subject to entropic decay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1301
01:17:06.430 --> 01:17:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Things fall apart of their own accord </v>
<v Speaker 1>across time.</v>

1302
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:11.300
<v Speaker 1>That's why you have to always fix </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1303
01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:13.880
<v Speaker 1>So if it's complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be maintained.</v>

1304
01:17:14.450 --> 01:17:15.283
<v Speaker 1>And so you can think about that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to say New Orleans before </v>

1305
01:17:18.321 --> 01:17:20.180
<v Speaker 1>the hurricane because people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1306
01:17:20.181 --> 01:17:24.620
<v Speaker 1>the hurricane caused a flood that </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroyed much of New Orleans,</v>

1307
01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:28.850
<v Speaker 1>and so that's an act of God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of looking at it,</v>

1308
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a random natural event.</v>

1309
01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:34.280
<v Speaker 1>But then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1310
01:17:34.281 --> 01:17:37.250
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Dutch,</v>

1311
01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:39.950
<v Speaker 1>their country's mostly underwater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1312
01:17:39.951 --> 01:17:40.784
<v Speaker 1>So they have these huge dykes to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sea back and they build the dike so </v>

1313
01:17:44.091 --> 01:17:44.924
<v Speaker 1>that only one storm every 10,000 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be of sufficient magnitude to </v>

1314
01:17:49.851 --> 01:17:53.420
<v Speaker 1>partially breach the dikes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's their engineering tolerance level</v>

1315
01:17:53.450 --> 01:17:58.450
<v Speaker 1>one storm in every 10,000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The US Army Corps of Engineers knew that</v>

1316
01:17:59.181 --> 01:18:03.860
<v Speaker 1>the dykes in New Orleans were built to </v>
<v Speaker 1>withstand one storm every hundred years,</v>

1317
01:18:03.890 --> 01:18:05.480
<v Speaker 1>the biggest storm every hundred years.</v>

1318
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:06.583
<v Speaker 1>And people knew that they weren't built </v>
<v Speaker 1>to proper tolerance and much of the </v>

1319
01:18:10.041 --> 01:18:15.041
<v Speaker 1>money that was hypothetically supposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be diverted or or,</v>

1320
01:18:15.411 --> 01:18:16.244
<v Speaker 1>or an assigned to the rebuilding and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintenance of the dikes disappeared </v>

1321
01:18:20.421 --> 01:18:21.254
<v Speaker 1>because of corruption in New Orleans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is in one of the most corrupt </v>

1322
01:18:24.051 --> 01:18:26.840
<v Speaker 1>states in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you might say,</v>

1323
01:18:26.841 --> 01:18:30.410
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did the flood destroyed New Orleans?</v>

1324
01:18:30.411 --> 01:18:31.670
<v Speaker 1>And one answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1325
01:18:31.850 --> 01:18:34.280
<v Speaker 1>it was a hurricane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other answer is no,</v>

1326
01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:35.653
<v Speaker 1>it was corrupt officials who weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to what they were </v>

1327
01:18:38.511 --> 01:18:41.450
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be paying attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the flood came.</v>

1328
01:18:41.690 --> 01:18:44.960
<v Speaker 1>And that's the meaning of the stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the sins of men,</v>

1329
01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:45.973
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the capacity of people to turn </v>

1330
01:18:47.841 --> 01:18:48.674
<v Speaker 1>a blind eye to their responsibilities </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they know perfectly well that </v>

1331
01:18:51.141 --> 01:18:51.974
<v Speaker 1>something needs to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you don't do what needs to be </v>

1332
01:18:54.591 --> 01:18:58.880
<v Speaker 1>done and something comes along to wipe </v>
<v Speaker 1>you out and it's perfectly reasonable to</v>

1333
01:18:58.881 --> 01:19:03.881
<v Speaker 1>view that as a judgment on your refusal </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do what you knew to be right.</v>

1334
01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:06.253
<v Speaker 1>So that's the flood story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the tower of Babel is a very </v>

1335
01:19:09.231 --> 01:19:10.220
<v Speaker 1>interesting story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

1336
01:19:10.221 --> 01:19:11.054
<v Speaker 1>very short.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is that it just starts </v>

1337
01:19:14.151 --> 01:19:16.250
<v Speaker 1>pretty much abruptly after the flood </v>
<v Speaker 1>story ends.</v>

1338
01:19:16.251 --> 01:19:17.084
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a story about the decision that </v>

1339
01:19:19.431 --> 01:19:22.010
<v Speaker 1>human beings take to build a mighty </v>
<v Speaker 1>building like a huge,</v>

1340
01:19:22.011 --> 01:19:26.960
<v Speaker 1>huge edifice that would reach all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way up to the heavens to supplant God,</v>

1341
01:19:27.290 --> 01:19:30.890
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is that the building</v>

1342
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:33.350
<v Speaker 1>is built higher and higher and higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>and higher.</v>

1343
01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:34.393
<v Speaker 1>And God gets annoyed about this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>divides everyone who's building the </v>

1344
01:19:38.811 --> 01:19:42.230
<v Speaker 1>building into small groups who speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>different languages,</v>

1345
01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:45.980
<v Speaker 1>who then disperse in the construction </v>
<v Speaker 1>project comes to a halt.</v>

1346
01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:48.680
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very strange story,</v>

1347
01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:51.020
<v Speaker 1>but here's one way of thinking about it.</v>

1348
01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Larger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you build a system,</v>

1349
01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:04.810
<v Speaker 1>the more there is a proclivity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>worship it as if it's everything.</v>

1350
01:20:05.290 --> 01:20:06.123
<v Speaker 1>That's the story of the geology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's you want to build a comprehensive </v>

1351
01:20:09.150 --> 01:20:12.930
<v Speaker 1>utopian system that supplants anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcended.</v>

1352
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:14.730
<v Speaker 1>You want to build it as large as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

1353
01:20:14.731 --> 01:20:17.580
<v Speaker 1>So when it companies encompasses </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone,</v>

1354
01:20:18.210 --> 01:20:19.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens as it grows?</v>

1355
01:20:20.130 --> 01:20:21.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it incorporates more and more people,</v>

1356
01:20:21.841 --> 01:20:25.500
<v Speaker 1>but the people within it become more and</v>
<v Speaker 1>more different from one another.</v>

1357
01:20:26.130 --> 01:20:29.730
<v Speaker 1>And so essentially they start speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>different languages.</v>

1358
01:20:30.030 --> 01:20:30.863
<v Speaker 1>And so the entire project of raising </v>
<v Speaker 1>this massive edifice to supplant </v>

1359
01:20:33.841 --> 01:20:38.841
<v Speaker 1>everything disperses into chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to a halt.</v>

1360
01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's one story.</v>

1361
01:20:40.591 --> 01:20:44.250
<v Speaker 1>So here's another story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a story that John Milton wrote.</v>

1362
01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:48.330
<v Speaker 1>John Milton wrote paradise lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the prime,</v>

1363
01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:50.250
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1364
01:20:50.250 --> 01:20:54.450
<v Speaker 1>Literary masterpieces of the last</v>

1365
01:20:55.970 --> 01:20:56.960
<v Speaker 1>500 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1366
01:20:56.990 --> 01:21:01.990
<v Speaker 1>here's what Milton Dick Milton said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to justify the ways of God</v>

1367
01:21:02.601 --> 01:21:05.000
<v Speaker 1>to man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was his purpose.</v>

1368
01:21:05.001 --> 01:21:07.730
<v Speaker 1>And so what he was trying to do was take</v>
<v Speaker 1>a look at the world,</v>

1369
01:21:07.731 --> 01:21:08.564
<v Speaker 1>the way it's constituted with all its </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering and malevolence and </v>

1370
01:21:10.581 --> 01:21:11.414
<v Speaker 1>corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to make a case why it was still </v>

1371
01:21:14.391 --> 01:21:17.210
<v Speaker 1>acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he did the first,</v>

1372
01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:18.583
<v Speaker 1>what you might think about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic study of malevolence and </v>

1373
01:21:20.811 --> 01:21:21.644
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So around the corpus of biblical </v>

1374
01:21:25.641 --> 01:21:28.640
<v Speaker 1>writings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is an idea of heaven and hell.</v>

1375
01:21:28.670 --> 01:21:31.820
<v Speaker 1>And they're not referred too much within</v>
<v Speaker 1>the corpus of biblical writings,</v>

1376
01:21:31.821 --> 01:21:36.200
<v Speaker 1>but there are what you might describe as</v>
<v Speaker 1>legends that have compiled around them.</v>

1377
01:21:36.590 --> 01:21:37.423
<v Speaker 1>So their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their stories that never became </v>

1378
01:21:39.231 --> 01:21:41.030
<v Speaker 1>canonical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are stories,</v>

1379
01:21:41.031 --> 01:21:43.820
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the idea that God's highest angel,</v>

1380
01:21:43.821 --> 01:21:45.530
<v Speaker 1>who was Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucifer,</v>

1381
01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:47.780
<v Speaker 1>the bringer of light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spirit of rationality,</v>

1382
01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:48.913
<v Speaker 1>fomented rebellion against God and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Heaven and was passed into hell as a </v>

1383
01:21:51.441 --> 01:21:52.274
<v Speaker 1>consequence.</v>

1384
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:54.410
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1385
01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:57.080
<v Speaker 1>Milton wrote this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rise of the nation states,</v>

1386
01:21:57.081 --> 01:21:57.914
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's this idea that there's this </v>

1387
01:22:00.171 --> 01:22:01.004
<v Speaker 1>idea that there's this tension between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the political and ideological and </v>

1388
01:22:07.221 --> 01:22:08.054
<v Speaker 1>rational constructions of the rational </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind and the sort of transcendent </v>

1389
01:22:11.810 --> 01:22:15.710
<v Speaker 1>mythology that guides human </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>

1390
01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:21.100
<v Speaker 1>And that Satan as God's highest as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>highest angel in God's heavenly kingdom,</v>

1391
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:23.143
<v Speaker 1>is a personification of the tendency of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rational mind to produce </v>

1392
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:29.720
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian systems and then to fall in</v>
<v Speaker 1>love with them.</v>

1393
01:22:30.050 --> 01:22:30.883
<v Speaker 1>So to produce a system that encompasses </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything like the tower of Babel so </v>

1394
01:22:34.101 --> 01:22:37.460
<v Speaker 1>that nothing outside the system is </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to exist.</v>

1395
01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:38.773
<v Speaker 1>While Milton's intuition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he collected the stories about </v>

1396
01:22:41.001 --> 01:22:41.834
<v Speaker 1>Satanic rebellion that had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulating across centuries from far </v>

1397
01:22:44.301 --> 01:22:48.170
<v Speaker 1>before Christianity was even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was even constituted,</v>

1398
01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:53.560
<v Speaker 1>turned this into a great poetic drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his hypothesis was that the,</v>

1399
01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:55.033
<v Speaker 1>the element of the psyche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say the spiritual element of the </v>

1400
01:22:57.411 --> 01:22:58.244
<v Speaker 1>psyche that characterize the rational </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind would by its proclivity to produce </v>

1401
01:23:02.841 --> 01:23:06.880
<v Speaker 1>these totalizing systems and op itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>into hell.</v>

1402
01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:08.493
<v Speaker 1>And so you could think about it as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>prophetic visualization of what was </v>

1403
01:23:12.611 --> 01:23:13.444
<v Speaker 1>going to come down the centuries after </v>
<v Speaker 1>Milton wrote because the poet's get </v>

1404
01:23:19.031 --> 01:23:21.580
<v Speaker 1>there before the philosophers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the artists get there.</v>

1405
01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Maybe before the poets and philosophers </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow in their wake.</v>

1406
01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:26.313
<v Speaker 1>The poets are the people who have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>visions of what's coming farthest down </v>

1407
01:23:29.171 --> 01:23:32.290
<v Speaker 1>the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is from Milton.</v>

1408
01:23:33.370 --> 01:23:38.350
<v Speaker 1>This is describing Satan after he's cast</v>
<v Speaker 1>into hell because of his rebellion,</v>

1409
01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:39.513
<v Speaker 1>his totalitarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the consequence of his totalitarian </v>

1410
01:23:42.731 --> 01:23:43.564
<v Speaker 1>rationalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For now the thought both of lost </v>

1411
01:23:45.341 --> 01:23:48.520
<v Speaker 1>happiness and lasting pain torments him </v>
<v Speaker 1>round.</v>

1412
01:23:48.730 --> 01:23:49.563
<v Speaker 1>He throws his baleful eyes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>witnessed huge affliction and dismay </v>

1413
01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:57.610
<v Speaker 1>mixed with obdurate pride in steadfast </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate as once at once,</v>

1414
01:23:57.790 --> 01:24:01.300
<v Speaker 1>as far as angels can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He views the dismal situation,</v>

1415
01:24:01.301 --> 01:24:02.770
<v Speaker 1>waste and wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dungeon,</v>

1416
01:24:02.771 --> 01:24:06.520
<v Speaker 1>horrible on all sides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>round as one great furnace.</v>

1417
01:24:06.521 --> 01:24:11.230
<v Speaker 1>Flamed yet from those flames,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no light but rather dark lists.</v>

1418
01:24:11.231 --> 01:24:14.830
<v Speaker 1>Darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>visible served only to discover sites of</v>

1419
01:24:14.831 --> 01:24:15.664
<v Speaker 1>whoa regions of sorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doleful shades where peace and rest can </v>

1420
01:24:19.661 --> 01:24:22.030
<v Speaker 1>never dwell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hope never comes.</v>

1421
01:24:22.031 --> 01:24:22.864
<v Speaker 1>That comes to all but torture without </v>
<v Speaker 1>end still urges and a fiery deluge fed </v>

1422
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:32.140
<v Speaker 1>with ever burning sulfur unconsumed such</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

1423
01:24:32.141 --> 01:24:35.500
<v Speaker 1>Eternal Justice had prepared for those </v>
<v Speaker 1>rebellious here,</v>

1424
01:24:35.501 --> 01:24:36.334
<v Speaker 1>their prison ordained in utter darkness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and their portion set as far removed </v>

1425
01:24:40.601 --> 01:24:45.550
<v Speaker 1>from God and light of Heaven as from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>center thrice to the utmost pole.</v>

1426
01:24:47.170 --> 01:24:52.170
<v Speaker 1>It's an existentialist claim or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the existentialist plate</v>

1427
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:55.783
<v Speaker 9>that the</v>

1428
01:24:57.610 --> 01:24:58.443
<v Speaker 1>conditions of human life are such that </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering is an integral part of </v>

1429
01:25:01.991 --> 01:25:02.824
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's an important thing to </v>

1430
01:25:04.871 --> 01:25:09.871
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also a viewpoint shared by the bulk</v>

1431
01:25:10.031 --> 01:25:12.040
<v Speaker 1>of the great religious systems of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1432
01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Life is suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1433
01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:16.293
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one reason is because of society's </v>

1434
01:25:20.051 --> 01:25:21.940
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1435
01:25:22.330 --> 01:25:23.163
<v Speaker 1>Every single one of us has</v>
<v Speaker 1>traits and features and and quirks and </v>

1436
01:25:30.761 --> 01:25:31.594
<v Speaker 1>idiosyncrasies that are far from ideal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that are judged by the standards of </v>

1437
01:25:38.981 --> 01:25:39.814
<v Speaker 1>society as insufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you suffer because of your </v>

1438
01:25:44.321 --> 01:25:45.154
<v Speaker 1>imperfect insufficiency in the eyes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>others and you can certainly make the </v>

1439
01:25:48.491 --> 01:25:52.600
<v Speaker 1>claim that fairly frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's arbitrary.</v>

1440
01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:53.553
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the claim that society is </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical and judgmental and it needs </v>

1441
01:25:57.371 --> 01:26:02.371
<v Speaker 1>to be constantly week constituted so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the tyrannical element doesn't take</v>

1442
01:26:05.241 --> 01:26:06.074
<v Speaker 1>full control and fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to stay awake so that that </v>

1443
01:26:08.541 --> 01:26:09.374
<v Speaker 1>doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is it doesn't matter what </v>

1444
01:26:12.891 --> 01:26:13.724
<v Speaker 1>society it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they vary in the degree of </v>

1445
01:26:15.561 --> 01:26:16.394
<v Speaker 1>their tyranny.</v>

1446
01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:17.233
<v Speaker 1>The mere fact that your group together </v>
<v Speaker 1>with other people and have to come up </v>

1447
01:26:19.821 --> 01:26:20.654
<v Speaker 1>with a common value structure in order </v>
<v Speaker 1>to live together means that many of the </v>

1448
01:26:23.631 --> 01:26:26.480
<v Speaker 1>things that characterize you are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be suboptimal.</v>

1449
01:26:26.810 --> 01:26:27.643
<v Speaker 1>And so the price you pay for social </v>
<v Speaker 1>being is that much of you is deemed </v>

1450
01:26:32.450 --> 01:26:34.730
<v Speaker 1>insufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1451
01:26:34.731 --> 01:26:35.564
<v Speaker 1>hopefully there are various ways that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be within the society that's </v>

1452
01:26:37.781 --> 01:26:42.781
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently diverse so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>find a place where what's good about you</v>

1453
01:26:42.861 --> 01:26:43.694
<v Speaker 1>in the eyes of others and perhaps in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own eyes can flourish of its own </v>

1454
01:26:47.421 --> 01:26:50.150
<v Speaker 1>accord because you don't have to be good</v>
<v Speaker 1>at everything.</v>

1455
01:26:50.151 --> 01:26:52.820
<v Speaker 1>If you can be good at at one thing well </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>

1456
01:26:52.850 --> 01:26:57.200
<v Speaker 1>that might allow you your niche and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully a healthy society allow us for</v>

1457
01:26:57.220 --> 01:26:58.053
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly societies can become so </v>

1458
01:26:59.121 --> 01:27:00.380
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't.</v>

1459
01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:01.933
<v Speaker 1>So you can lay one source of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering out the feet of tyrannical </v>

1460
01:27:04.851 --> 01:27:05.690
<v Speaker 1>social structures.</v>

1461
01:27:05.690 --> 01:27:06.523
<v Speaker 1>But the other element of it clearly is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mere fact of the arbitrary ness of </v>

1462
01:27:12.291 --> 01:27:13.124
<v Speaker 1>the natural world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a lifespan that's going to be </v>

1463
01:27:15.591 --> 01:27:16.424
<v Speaker 1>counted in the number of decades that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can count on two hands and that has </v>

1464
01:27:20.841 --> 01:27:24.080
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do technically with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyranny of the social structure.</v>

1465
01:27:24.081 --> 01:27:24.914
<v Speaker 1>Now you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we got our act together more </v>

1466
01:27:26.571 --> 01:27:27.404
<v Speaker 1>completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps you could live longer and fair </v>

1467
01:27:28.851 --> 01:27:29.684
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact of the limits of your </v>

1468
01:27:31.011 --> 01:27:34.670
<v Speaker 1>lifespan and the suffering that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily a consequence of that,</v>

1469
01:27:34.671 --> 01:27:39.110
<v Speaker 1>the death of your parents and the death </v>
<v Speaker 1>of most people that you will know before</v>

1470
01:27:39.111 --> 01:27:44.111
<v Speaker 1>you means that that part of suffering is</v>
<v Speaker 1>an integral part of existence itself.</v>

1471
01:27:46.250 --> 01:27:49.820
<v Speaker 1>And so that can't be laid at his feet of</v>
<v Speaker 1>an insufficient social structure,</v>

1472
01:27:49.821 --> 01:27:52.280
<v Speaker 1>except in so far as it's tyrannical and </v>
<v Speaker 1>blind.</v>

1473
01:27:52.490 --> 01:27:55.250
<v Speaker 1>It's a condition of existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then by the same token,</v>

1474
01:27:55.251 --> 01:27:56.084
<v Speaker 1>you have your own responsibility for </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of your unnecessary suffering </v>

1475
01:27:59.931 --> 01:28:00.764
<v Speaker 1>because there's things you could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing to make your life better and to </v>

1476
01:28:03.621 --> 01:28:04.454
<v Speaker 1>make life better for other people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know perfectly well that you're not </v>

1477
01:28:07.071 --> 01:28:07.850
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

1478
01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:08.683
<v Speaker 1>And so if you stopped doing all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary things that make your life </v>

1479
01:28:12.441 --> 01:28:13.274
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it would improve to some degree </v>

1480
01:28:14.661 --> 01:28:18.530
<v Speaker 1>that is not ready computable because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know how far you could push that.</v>

1481
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:19.663
<v Speaker 1>So there's three reasons why you suffer </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one is well look at you and the way </v>

1482
01:28:23.571 --> 01:28:25.070
<v Speaker 1>you're built.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's inevitable.</v>

1483
01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:27.650
<v Speaker 1>There's not very much of you and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of everything else.</v>

1484
01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:29.053
<v Speaker 1>And so you just don't last that long and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fragile across multiple domains </v>

1485
01:28:32.691 --> 01:28:33.524
<v Speaker 1>and then you're harshly treated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>society and there is no doubt about </v>

1486
01:28:35.691 --> 01:28:37.910
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's responsibility that can</v>

1487
01:28:37.911 --> 01:28:38.744
<v Speaker 1>be laid at your own feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the existential take on that in </v>

1488
01:28:41.571 --> 01:28:44.480
<v Speaker 1>the thing that all these diverse people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've been talking about,</v>

1489
01:28:44.481 --> 01:28:48.170
<v Speaker 1>including Viktor Frankl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn as well</v>

1490
01:28:48.171 --> 01:28:50.220
<v Speaker 1>as um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1491
01:28:50.270 --> 01:28:51.103
<v Speaker 1>Kierkegaard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche and Dostoevsky and the people </v>

1492
01:28:52.551 --> 01:28:53.384
<v Speaker 1>that I've already talked to you about is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the proper pathway through that is </v>

1493
01:28:57.801 --> 01:29:02.490
<v Speaker 1>to adopt the mode of</v>
<v Speaker 1>authentic being.</v>

1494
01:29:03.630 --> 01:29:04.463
<v Speaker 1>And that is something like refusing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>participate in the lie in deception and </v>

1495
01:29:09.991 --> 01:29:14.160
<v Speaker 1>the lie to Orient your speech as much as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can towards the truth.</v>

1496
01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:16.073
<v Speaker 1>And to take responsibility for your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>life and perhaps also for the lives of </v>

1497
01:29:18.991 --> 01:29:19.824
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's something about that that's </v>

1498
01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:22.733
<v Speaker 1>meaningful and responsible and noble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also serves to mitigate the very </v>

1499
01:29:27.571 --> 01:29:28.404
<v Speaker 1>suffering that produces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say that nihilism or the flee into the </v>

1500
01:29:31.861 --> 01:29:33.870
<v Speaker 1>arms of fleet or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the,</v>

1501
01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:37.680
<v Speaker 1>or the escape into the arms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarians to begin with.</v>

1502
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:39.383
<v Speaker 1>You need something to shelter you </v>
<v Speaker 1>against your own vulnerability and you </v>

1503
01:29:44.011 --> 01:29:44.844
<v Speaker 1>can adopt a comprehensive description of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality that's formulated for you by </v>

1504
01:29:48.631 --> 01:29:49.464
<v Speaker 1>someone else that neatly divides the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world into those who are innocent and </v>

1505
01:29:53.131 --> 01:29:53.964
<v Speaker 1>perhaps innocent victims and those who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are guilty and perhaps the perpetrators </v>

1506
01:29:57.001 --> 01:29:59.550
<v Speaker 1>of the suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But none of that has anything to do with</v>

1507
01:29:59.551 --> 01:29:59.850
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1508
01:29:59.850 --> 01:30:01.890
<v Speaker 1>And in addition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's simply not,</v>

1509
01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:03.413
<v Speaker 1>it's not a reasonable way of assessing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world that the suffering is built </v>

1510
01:30:07.290 --> 01:30:10.020
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why the AA,</v>

1511
01:30:10.021 --> 01:30:12.540
<v Speaker 1>there's an existentialist insistence </v>
<v Speaker 1>upon that.</v>

1512
01:30:12.541 --> 01:30:13.720
<v Speaker 1>So that for the Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ian's,</v>

1513
01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:16.770
<v Speaker 1>the psychoanalysts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even for people like Carl Rogers,</v>

1514
01:30:16.771 --> 01:30:17.604
<v Speaker 1>to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a situation that's </v>

1515
01:30:20.941 --> 01:30:23.730
<v Speaker 1>characterized by psychopathology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's something wrong with you,</v>

1516
01:30:23.731 --> 01:30:24.564
<v Speaker 1>mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a consequence of something gone </v>

1517
01:30:26.281 --> 01:30:27.114
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's not the existentialist take </v>

1518
01:30:28.741 --> 01:30:31.380
<v Speaker 1>the existentialists take is now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just how it is.</v>

1519
01:30:31.710 --> 01:30:32.543
<v Speaker 1>That's just how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to necessarily have done </v>

1520
01:30:35.341 --> 01:30:38.070
<v Speaker 1>anything wrong for things to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely out of control.</v>

1521
01:30:38.850 --> 01:30:42.750
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrifying doctrine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a hopeless doctrine because</v>

1522
01:30:42.751 --> 01:30:44.760
<v Speaker 1>it still says that there's a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

1523
01:30:44.761 --> 01:30:45.594
<v Speaker 1>There is a pathway forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pathway forward is to adopt a mode of </v>

1524
01:30:48.871 --> 01:30:49.704
<v Speaker 1>being that has some nobility so that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can tolerate yourself and perhaps even </v>

1525
01:30:54.751 --> 01:30:55.584
<v Speaker 1>have some respect for yourself as </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's capable of standing up in </v>

1526
01:30:59.281 --> 01:31:01.980
<v Speaker 1>the face of that terrible vulnerability </v>
<v Speaker 1>and suffering.</v>

1527
01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:06.030
<v Speaker 1>And that the pathway forward as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the existentialists are concerned is by,</v>

1528
01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:08.820
<v Speaker 1>well certainly by the avoidance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>deceit,</v>

1529
01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:09.713
<v Speaker 1>particularly in language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also by the adoption of </v>

1530
01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:13.733
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for the conditions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence in some attempt on your part </v>

1531
01:31:16.741 --> 01:31:17.574
<v Speaker 1>to actually rectify them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing that's so interesting </v>

1532
01:31:19.471 --> 01:31:22.080
<v Speaker 1>about that is there were up to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

1533
01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:24.690
<v Speaker 1>and some of this is from clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

1534
01:31:24.691 --> 01:31:25.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take people,</v>

1535
01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:26.903
<v Speaker 1>and I've told you this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you expose them voluntarily to </v>

1536
01:31:29.161 --> 01:31:31.710
<v Speaker 1>things that they are avoiding and are </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid of,</v>

1537
01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:32.573
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they know they need to overcome in </v>

1538
01:31:33.601 --> 01:31:36.060
<v Speaker 1>order to meet their goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their self defined goals.</v>

1539
01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:37.193
<v Speaker 1>If you can teach people to stand up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the face of the things they're afraid </v>

1540
01:31:39.841 --> 01:31:40.674
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get stronger and you don't know </v>

1541
01:31:42.781 --> 01:31:43.614
<v Speaker 1>what the upper limits to that are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you might ask yourself like if </v>

1542
01:31:46.081 --> 01:31:46.914
<v Speaker 1>for 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't avoid doing what you knew </v>

1543
01:31:49.621 --> 01:31:52.290
<v Speaker 1>you needed to do by the death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by your own definitions,</v>

1544
01:31:52.291 --> 01:31:54.570
<v Speaker 1>right within the value structure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've created,</v>

1545
01:31:54.690 --> 01:31:57.720
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that you've done that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you be like?</v>

1546
01:31:59.530 --> 01:32:00.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1547
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:01.053
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are remarkable people who come </v>

1548
01:32:02.021 --> 01:32:02.854
<v Speaker 2>into the world from time to time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people who do find out over </v>

1549
01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:10.060
<v Speaker 2>decades long periods what they could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like if they were who they were.</v>

1550
01:32:10.270 --> 01:32:11.103
<v Speaker 2>If they said if they spoke their being </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward and they get stronger and </v>

1551
01:32:16.301 --> 01:32:18.820
<v Speaker 2>stronger and stronger and we don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>the limits to that.</v>

1552
01:32:18.821 --> 01:32:21.310
<v Speaker 2>We do not know the limits to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you could say,</v>

1553
01:32:21.311 --> 01:32:21.911
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in part,</v>

1554
01:32:21.911 --> 01:32:22.744
<v Speaker 2>perhaps the reason that you're suffering</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbearably can be left at your feet </v>

1555
01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:28.810
<v Speaker 2>because you're not everything you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>be and you know it.</v>

1556
01:32:29.140 --> 01:32:29.973
<v Speaker 2>And of course that's a terrible thing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>admit and it's a terrible thing to </v>

1557
01:32:32.471 --> 01:32:34.960
<v Speaker 2>consider,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's real promise in it,</v>

1558
01:32:34.990 --> 01:32:36.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it means that</v>

1559
01:32:37.870 --> 01:32:40.610
<v Speaker 2>perhaps there's another way that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could look at the world in a number,</v>

1560
01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:42.970
<v Speaker 2>another way that you could act in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1561
01:32:42.970 --> 01:32:43.803
<v Speaker 2>So what it would reflect back to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be much better than what it </v>

1562
01:32:45.701 --> 01:32:49.180
<v Speaker 2>reflects back to you now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the second part of that is,</v>

1563
01:32:49.181 --> 01:32:50.014
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine that many people did that </v>

1564
01:32:51.911 --> 01:32:54.010
<v Speaker 2>because we've done a lot as human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>

1565
01:32:54.011 --> 01:32:56.860
<v Speaker 2>We've done a lot of remarkable things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I told you already,</v>

1566
01:32:56.920 --> 01:32:58.930
<v Speaker 2>I think before the today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1567
01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:00.033
<v Speaker 2>about 250,000 people will be lifted out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of abject poverty and about 300,000 </v>

1568
01:33:04.271 --> 01:33:08.440
<v Speaker 2>people a attached to the electrical </v>
<v Speaker 2>power grid or making people were lifting</v>

1569
01:33:08.441 --> 01:33:09.274
<v Speaker 2>people out of poverty collectively at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>faster rate that's ever occurred in the </v>

1570
01:33:11.891 --> 01:33:12.724
<v Speaker 2>history of humankind by a huge margin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's been going on unbelievably </v>

1571
01:33:16.571 --> 01:33:21.571
<v Speaker 2>quickly since the year 2000 the UN had </v>
<v Speaker 2>planned to have poverty between 2000 and</v>

1572
01:33:21.971 --> 01:33:22.804
<v Speaker 2>2015 and it was accomplished by 2013 so </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's inequality developing in many </v>

1573
01:33:28.451 --> 01:33:31.300
<v Speaker 2>places and you hear lots of political </v>
<v Speaker 2>agitation about that.</v>

1574
01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:32.313
<v Speaker 2>But overall the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tide is lifting everyone up and </v>

1575
01:33:35.111 --> 01:33:35.944
<v Speaker 2>that's a great thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we have no idea how fast we could </v>

1576
01:33:37.451 --> 01:33:40.960
<v Speaker 2>multiply that if people got their act </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and really aimed at it.</v>

1577
01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:42.101
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1578
01:33:42.101 --> 01:33:42.934
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my experience is with people that were </v>

1579
01:33:45.101 --> 01:33:48.370
<v Speaker 2>probably running at about 51% of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity.</v>

1580
01:33:48.670 --> 01:33:49.211
<v Speaker 2>Something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1581
01:33:49.211 --> 01:33:50.044
<v Speaker 2>you can think about this yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I often ask undergraduates how many </v>

1582
01:33:54.130 --> 01:33:56.440
<v Speaker 2>hours a day you waste or how many hours </v>
<v Speaker 2>a week you waste.</v>

1583
01:33:56.860 --> 01:33:59.950
<v Speaker 2>The classic answer is something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>four to six hours a day,</v>

1584
01:34:00.370 --> 01:34:02.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inefficient studying,</v>

1585
01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:04.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching things on youtube that not only</v>

1586
01:34:04.901 --> 01:34:05.734
<v Speaker 2>do you not want to watch that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even care about that make you feel </v>

1587
01:34:07.781 --> 01:34:09.940
<v Speaker 2>horrible about watching after you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>

1588
01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:13.210
<v Speaker 2>that's probably four hours right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you think,</v>

1589
01:34:13.211 --> 01:34:16.960
<v Speaker 2>well that's 2025 hours a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a hundred hours a month.</v>

1590
01:34:16.961 --> 01:34:18.910
<v Speaker 2>That's two and a half full work weeks.</v>

1591
01:34:19.090 --> 01:34:24.090
<v Speaker 2>It's half a year of work weeks per year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if your time is worth $20 an hour,</v>

1592
01:34:25.031 --> 01:34:25.864
<v Speaker 2>which is a radical underestimate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably more like 50 if you think </v>

1593
01:34:28.391 --> 01:34:32.560
<v Speaker 2>about it in terms of deferred wages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're wasting 20 hours a week,</v>

1594
01:34:32.650 --> 01:34:33.483
<v Speaker 2>you're racing $50,000 a year and you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that right now and it's because </v>

1595
01:34:37.841 --> 01:34:38.674
<v Speaker 2>you're young wasting $50,000 a year as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>way bigger catastrophe than it would be </v>

1596
01:34:41.831 --> 01:34:44.500
<v Speaker 2>for me to waste it because I'm not going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to last nearly as long.</v>

1597
01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:46.750
<v Speaker 2>And so if your life isn't everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be,</v>

1598
01:34:46.751 --> 01:34:47.584
<v Speaker 2>you could ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what would happen if you just </v>

1599
01:34:49.061 --> 01:34:52.300
<v Speaker 2>stopped wasting the opportunities that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are in front of you?</v>

1600
01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:55.660
<v Speaker 2>You'd be who knows how much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>efficient,</v>

1601
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:59.330
<v Speaker 2>10 times more efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 times more efficient.</v>

1602
01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:03.170
<v Speaker 2>That's the burrito distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have no idea how efficient,</v>

1603
01:35:03.171 --> 01:35:05.480
<v Speaker 2>efficient people get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's completely,</v>

1604
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:06.890
<v Speaker 2>it's off the charts.</v>

1605
01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:09.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1606
01:35:09.090 --> 01:35:09.923
<v Speaker 2>Well and if we all got her act together </v>
<v Speaker 2>collectively and stopped making things </v>

1607
01:35:13.261 --> 01:35:16.020
<v Speaker 2>worse because that's another thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>people do all the time.</v>

1608
01:35:16.230 --> 01:35:19.170
<v Speaker 2>Not only do they not do what they should</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make things better,</v>

1609
01:35:19.290 --> 01:35:20.123
<v Speaker 2>they actively attempt to make things </v>
<v Speaker 2>worse because they're spiteful or </v>

1610
01:35:22.591 --> 01:35:23.424
<v Speaker 2>resentful or arrogant or deceitful or or</v>
<v Speaker 2>homicidal or genocidal or all of those </v>

1611
01:35:29.101 --> 01:35:29.934
<v Speaker 2>things all</v>

1612
01:35:30.700 --> 01:35:33.760
<v Speaker 2>bundled together in an absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathological package.</v>

1613
01:35:34.180 --> 01:35:37.990
<v Speaker 2>If people stopped really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really trying just to make things worse,</v>

1614
01:35:38.170 --> 01:35:41.080
<v Speaker 2>we have no idea how much better they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would get just because of that.</v>

1615
01:35:41.890 --> 01:35:42.723
<v Speaker 2>So there's this weird dynamic that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the existential system of ideas </v>

1616
01:35:46.031 --> 01:35:49.240
<v Speaker 2>between human vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social judgment,</v>

1617
01:35:49.780 --> 01:35:51.490
<v Speaker 2>both of which are are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

1618
01:35:51.730 --> 01:35:52.563
<v Speaker 2>are major causes of suffering and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>failure of individuals to adopt the </v>

1619
01:35:55.901 --> 01:35:58.810
<v Speaker 2>responsibility that they know they </v>
<v Speaker 2>should adopt.</v>

1620
01:35:59.110 --> 01:36:02.740
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing that's interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>too is that like one of the,</v>

1621
01:36:02.741 --> 01:36:06.160
<v Speaker 2>another thing I've asked often asked my </v>
<v Speaker 2>undergraduate classes is,</v>

1622
01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:07.593
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this idea that if people have </v>

1623
01:36:09.191 --> 01:36:10.690
<v Speaker 2>that people have a conscience</v>

1624
01:36:11.630 --> 01:36:13.700
<v Speaker 2>and you know what the conscience is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1625
01:36:13.970 --> 01:36:14.803
<v Speaker 2>it's this feeling or voice you have in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your head just before you do something </v>

1626
01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:19.873
<v Speaker 2>that you know is stupid telling you that</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably you shouldn't do that stupid </v>

1627
01:36:23.271 --> 01:36:25.940
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to listen to it strangely</v>

1628
01:36:25.941 --> 01:36:28.730
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you go ahead and do it anyways.</v>

1629
01:36:28.731 --> 01:36:29.564
<v Speaker 2>And then of course exactly what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscience told you was going to happen </v>

1630
01:36:32.121 --> 01:36:35.660
<v Speaker 2>inevitably happen so that you'll feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>even stupider about it than you would if</v>

1631
01:36:35.661 --> 01:36:37.380
<v Speaker 2>it happened by accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you knew,</v>

1632
01:36:37.381 --> 01:36:39.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew this was going to happen,</v>

1633
01:36:39.770 --> 01:36:43.250
<v Speaker 2>I got a warning it was going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I went and did it anyways.</v>

1634
01:36:43.251 --> 01:36:46.580
<v Speaker 2>And the funny thing too is that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscience operates within people and we</v>

1635
01:36:46.581 --> 01:36:48.770
<v Speaker 2>really don't understand what the hell </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is.</v>

1636
01:36:50.250 --> 01:36:51.090
<v Speaker 2>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1637
01:36:51.091 --> 01:36:51.924
<v Speaker 2>what would happen if you abided by your </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscience for five years or for 10 </v>

1638
01:36:54.631 --> 01:36:57.000
<v Speaker 2>years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What sort of position might you be in?</v>

1639
01:36:57.001 --> 01:36:57.834
<v Speaker 2>What sort of family might you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what sort of relationship might you be </v>

1640
01:37:00.391 --> 01:37:01.224
<v Speaker 2>able to forge?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can be bloody sure that a </v>

1641
01:37:03.091 --> 01:37:08.091
<v Speaker 2>relationship that's forged on the basis </v>
<v Speaker 2>of who you actually are is going to be a</v>

1642
01:37:08.341 --> 01:37:09.174
<v Speaker 2>lot stronger and more welcome than one </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's forged on the basis of who you </v>

1643
01:37:12.151 --> 01:37:13.440
<v Speaker 2>aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1644
01:37:13.441 --> 01:37:14.274
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means that the person you're with </v>

1645
01:37:15.241 --> 01:37:16.074
<v Speaker 2>has to deal with the full force of you </v>
<v Speaker 2>in all your ability and your </v>

1646
01:37:19.831 --> 01:37:21.420
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very,</v>

1647
01:37:21.421 --> 01:37:25.440
<v Speaker 2>very difficult thing to negotiate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you do negotiate it well,</v>

1648
01:37:25.441 --> 01:37:27.090
<v Speaker 2>at least you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have something,</v>

1649
01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:30.300
<v Speaker 2>you have somewhere solid to stand and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have somewhere to live.</v>

1650
01:37:30.301 --> 01:37:31.134
<v Speaker 2>You have a real life and it's a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>basis upon which to bring children into </v>

1651
01:37:35.341 --> 01:37:36.300
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1652
01:37:36.301 --> 01:37:37.134
<v Speaker 2>because you can have an actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with them instead of </v>

1653
01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:43.530
<v Speaker 2>torturing them half to death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what happens in a tremendous,</v>

1654
01:37:44.190 --> 01:37:46.830
<v Speaker 2>a tremendously large minority of cases.</v>

1655
01:37:48.330 --> 01:37:50.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more than that too because,</v>

1656
01:37:50.101 --> 01:37:50.934
<v Speaker 2>and this is what I'll close with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is why I wanted to introduce </v>

1657
01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:54.540
<v Speaker 2>Solzhenitsyn's writings to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>

1658
01:37:54.810 --> 01:37:55.643
<v Speaker 2>because it isn't merely that your fate </v>
<v Speaker 2>depends on whether or not you get your </v>

1659
01:37:59.701 --> 01:38:00.534
<v Speaker 2>act together and to what degree you </v>
<v Speaker 2>decide that you're going to live out </v>

1660
01:38:03.991 --> 01:38:07.080
<v Speaker 2>your own genuine being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't only your fate,</v>

1661
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:09.810
<v Speaker 2>it's the fate of everyone that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>networked with.</v>

1662
01:38:10.110 --> 01:38:11.310
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

1663
01:38:11.311 --> 01:38:13.620
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's 9 billion,</v>

1664
01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:14.513
<v Speaker 2>7 billion people in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to peak at about 9 billion </v>

1665
01:38:16.981 --> 01:38:19.080
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it'll decline rapidly,</v>

1666
01:38:19.081 --> 01:38:21.660
<v Speaker 2>but 7 billion people in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and who are you?</v>

1667
01:38:21.661 --> 01:38:24.900
<v Speaker 2>You're just one little dust mote among </v>
<v Speaker 2>that 7 billion.</v>

1668
01:38:24.901 --> 01:38:27.150
<v Speaker 2>And so it really doesn't matter what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do or don't do,</v>

1669
01:38:27.151 --> 01:38:27.984
<v Speaker 2>but that's simply not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the wrong model because you're at </v>

1670
01:38:31.231 --> 01:38:34.890
<v Speaker 2>the center of a network,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a node in a network.</v>

1671
01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:35.873
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's even more true now that we have </v>

1672
01:38:36.811 --> 01:38:38.120
<v Speaker 2>social media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll,</v>

1673
01:38:38.121 --> 01:38:38.954
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll know a thousand people at least </v>

1674
01:38:40.441 --> 01:38:41.274
<v Speaker 2>over the course of your life and they'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>know a thousand people each and that </v>

1675
01:38:43.621 --> 01:38:47.910
<v Speaker 2>puts you one person away from 1,000,002 </v>
<v Speaker 2>persons away from a billion.</v>

1676
01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:51.420
<v Speaker 2>And so that's how you're connected and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things you do,</v>

1677
01:38:51.630 --> 01:38:56.010
<v Speaker 2>they're like dropping a stone in a pond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ripples move outward and they affect</v>

1678
01:38:56.011 --> 01:38:58.950
<v Speaker 2>things in ways that you can't fully </v>
<v Speaker 2>comprehend.</v>

1679
01:38:58.951 --> 01:38:59.784
<v Speaker 2>And it means that the things that you do</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that you don't do are far more </v>

1680
01:39:02.671 --> 01:39:07.050
<v Speaker 2>important than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you act that way,</v>

1681
01:39:07.051 --> 01:39:07.884
<v Speaker 2>of course the terror of realizing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it actually starts to matter </v>

1682
01:39:10.711 --> 01:39:11.970
<v Speaker 2>what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>

1683
01:39:11.971 --> 01:39:14.910
<v Speaker 2>well that's better than living a </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningless existence.</v>

1684
01:39:14.970 --> 01:39:18.540
<v Speaker 2>It's better for it to matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean if you really ask yourself,</v>

1685
01:39:18.541 --> 01:39:20.640
<v Speaker 2>would you be so sure if you had the </v>
<v Speaker 2>choice?</v>

1686
01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:23.490
<v Speaker 2>I can live with no responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>

1687
01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:24.473
<v Speaker 2>The price I pay is that nothing matters </v>
<v Speaker 2>or I can reverse it and everything </v>

1688
01:39:28.321 --> 01:39:29.154
<v Speaker 2>matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I have to take the responsibility </v>

1689
01:39:31.261 --> 01:39:32.094
<v Speaker 2>that's associated with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not so obvious to me that people </v>

1690
01:39:34.621 --> 01:39:37.440
<v Speaker 2>would take the meaningful path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1691
01:39:37.441 --> 01:39:38.131
<v Speaker 2>When you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1692
01:39:38.131 --> 01:39:38.964
<v Speaker 2>nihilists suffer dreadfully because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no meaning in their life and </v>

1693
01:39:40.891 --> 01:39:41.880
<v Speaker 2>they still suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1694
01:39:41.881 --> 01:39:44.160
<v Speaker 2>but the advantages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have no responsibility.</v>

1695
01:39:44.910 --> 01:39:45.743
<v Speaker 2>So that's the payoff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I actually think that's the </v>

1696
01:39:47.041 --> 01:39:47.851
<v Speaker 2>motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>

1697
01:39:47.851 --> 01:39:49.380
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't help being nihilistic.</v>

1698
01:39:49.381 --> 01:39:51.300
<v Speaker 2>All my belief systems have collapsed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1699
01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:52.350
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>

1700
01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:53.873
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you've just allowed them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>collapse because it's a hell of a lot </v>

1701
01:39:55.441 --> 01:39:56.274
<v Speaker 2>easier than acting them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the price you pay is some </v>

1702
01:39:58.130 --> 01:39:58.963
<v Speaker 2>meaningless suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you can always whine about that and </v>

1703
01:40:00.331 --> 01:40:03.720
<v Speaker 2>people will feel sorry for you and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the option of taking the pathway of</v>

1704
01:40:03.721 --> 01:40:04.180
<v Speaker 2>the martyr.</v>

1705
01:40:04.180 --> 01:40:06.450
<v Speaker 2>So that's a pretty good deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All things considered,</v>

1706
01:40:06.690 --> 01:40:07.523
<v Speaker 2>especially when the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the alternative is to bear your </v>

1707
01:40:11.431 --> 01:40:14.670
<v Speaker 2>burden properly and to live forthrightly</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>

1708
01:40:14.671 --> 01:40:15.504
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's Sojitz and figured out and so </v>

1709
01:40:16.801 --> 01:40:19.380
<v Speaker 2>many people in the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just him,</v>

1710
01:40:19.381 --> 01:40:24.360
<v Speaker 2>even though he's the best example is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you live a pathological life,</v>

1711
01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:28.500
<v Speaker 2>you pathologize your society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if enough people do that,</v>

1712
01:40:28.501 --> 01:40:33.120
<v Speaker 2>then it's hell really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>

1713
01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:37.120
<v Speaker 2>And you can read the Gulag archipelago </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have the fortitude,</v>

1714
01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:37.973
<v Speaker 2>fortitude to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you'll see exactly what hell is </v>

1715
01:40:39.841 --> 01:40:40.674
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you can decide if that's a </v>

1716
01:40:41.881 --> 01:40:44.700
<v Speaker 2>place you'd like to visit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or even more importantly,</v>

1717
01:40:44.701 --> 01:40:45.534
<v Speaker 2>if it's a light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's a place you'd like to visit and </v>

1718
01:40:47.401 --> 01:40:51.360
<v Speaker 2>take all your family and friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's what happened in the 20th</v>

1719
01:40:51.361 --> 01:40:52.194
<v Speaker 2>century.</v>

1720
01:40:57.020 --> 01:41:01.640
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
