<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.030
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen people since the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>time I was.</v>

3
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.040
<v Speaker 2>I was originally planning to speak to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you about responsibility.</v>

4
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:28.623
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to suggest that you should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>leery of trusting people whose primary </v>

5
00:00:33.911 --> 00:00:34.744
<v Speaker 2>concern here's to be their own rights or</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rights of the hypothetically </v>

6
00:00:38.711 --> 00:00:39.544
<v Speaker 2>oppressed groups that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically could by no means </v>

7
00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:45.940
<v Speaker 2>necessarily to speak for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still want to do that.</v>

8
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.830
<v Speaker 2>It's better for young people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrate on the responsibility rather</v>

9
00:00:50.831 --> 00:00:54.790
<v Speaker 2>than the rights they've been cared for </v>
<v Speaker 2>all their lives,</v>

10
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.713
<v Speaker 2>but other people being as of yet unable </v>
<v Speaker 2>to give back to the world what it takes </v>

11
00:00:59.771 --> 00:01:00.604
<v Speaker 2>to mature their survival.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not merely initiative obligation </v>

12
00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:06.640
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Young people,</v>

13
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.593
<v Speaker 2>not only young people need meaning in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their lives as well as do regard from </v>

14
00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:12.304
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meaning is to be following in </v>

15
00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:14.974
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People find meaning and the </v>

16
00:01:17.111 --> 00:01:19.720
<v Speaker 2>responsibility of their careers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their families,</v>

17
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.380
<v Speaker 2>their friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chairman,</v>

18
00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:24.580
<v Speaker 2>the work they do for others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the education they pursued,</v>

19
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.533
<v Speaker 2>the voluntary obligations they undertake</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the suffering they endeavor to </v>

20
00:01:29.141 --> 00:01:29.974
<v Speaker 2>reduce.</v>

21
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.750
<v Speaker 2>It's not the rights that are granted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you by others so that you can be awarded</v>

22
00:01:34.751 --> 00:01:35.584
<v Speaker 2>your rewards and privileges that will </v>
<v Speaker 2>make your limited and mortal life </v>

23
00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:41.470
<v Speaker 2>worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

24
00:01:41.471 --> 00:01:42.304
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sacrifices you make to the highest </v>

25
00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:47.650
<v Speaker 2>good that you can conceptualize and </v>
<v Speaker 2>strive to attain.</v>

26
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.130
<v Speaker 2>Beware the peddlers of rights and wish </v>
<v Speaker 2>to turn you into someone who is similar,</v>

27
00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:54.870
<v Speaker 2>Tanium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asleep,</v>

28
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.020
<v Speaker 2>privileged and victimized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why narcissistic,</v>

29
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.180
<v Speaker 2>noisy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>demanding,</v>

30
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.770
<v Speaker 2>chronically unhappy and of little use to</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves or other people.</v>

31
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:07.703
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort yourselves out shoulder your </v>

32
00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:14.170
<v Speaker 2>responsibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make yourself useful to others.</v>

33
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.573
<v Speaker 2>Find the heaviest burden you can bear </v>
<v Speaker 2>and bear it stoically forthrightly and </v>

34
00:02:20.411 --> 00:02:21.244
<v Speaker 2>admirably.</v>

35
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.280
<v Speaker 2>Having dealt with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll turn it to something that I believe</v>

36
00:02:27.281 --> 00:02:30.730
<v Speaker 2>is more pressing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're all here because you're concerned</v>

37
00:02:30.731 --> 00:02:31.564
<v Speaker 2>about the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm concerned about the future too </v>

38
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.780
<v Speaker 2>because of that concern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel it necessary to say a few words,</v>

39
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.153
<v Speaker 2>which I'm still trying to formulate </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly about the newest form of </v>

40
00:02:42.581 --> 00:02:45.520
<v Speaker 2>political pathology to manifest itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this.</v>

41
00:02:45.521 --> 00:02:46.354
<v Speaker 2>Our district,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they confused in chaotic Western </v>

42
00:02:48.071 --> 00:02:50.020
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Truly.</v>

43
00:02:50.021 --> 00:02:52.750
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should not say newest.</v>

44
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.420
<v Speaker 2>I should stay say in stamp the </v>
<v Speaker 2>resurgence of an exceptionally dangerous</v>

45
00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.283
<v Speaker 2>logically and thoroughly discredited </v>
<v Speaker 2>older ideal one the dude entire </v>

46
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:09.710
<v Speaker 2>societies and huge populations to </v>
<v Speaker 2>unnecessary suffering and the bloody and</v>

47
00:03:09.711 --> 00:03:12.820
<v Speaker 2>done fortunate and all too forgotten </v>
<v Speaker 2>from 20th century.</v>

48
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.853
<v Speaker 2>The idea equality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reasonable value placed among other </v>

49
00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:21.970
<v Speaker 2>values,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again the dog,</v>

50
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.823
<v Speaker 2>but he only made it to the highest place</v>
<v Speaker 2>and promoted blindly later with an </v>

51
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:28.150
<v Speaker 2>undertone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>undeserved,</v>

52
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:29.640
<v Speaker 2>nuorder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Devon's resentment,</v>

53
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 2>jealousy spike in hate.</v>

54
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.280
<v Speaker 2>It's not just equality and it's more of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Banal.</v>

55
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.770
<v Speaker 2>Next prestige is not merely equality of </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity.</v>

56
00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:43.771
<v Speaker 2>To say that I don't talk about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>equity and quality of outcome,</v>

57
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate can rapid wolf in the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>caring,</v>

58
00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:50.720
<v Speaker 2>the sheep's clothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's line of equity is being raised as a</v>

59
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.620
<v Speaker 2>group and it's the very social justice </v>
<v Speaker 2>warriors,</v>

60
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:54.573
<v Speaker 2>the very postmodern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neo Marxists activist activists whose </v>

61
00:03:56.471 --> 00:03:59.260
<v Speaker 2>words I despise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're waiving it everywhere.</v>

62
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.560
<v Speaker 2>The danger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this presents can barely be overstated.</v>

63
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.200
<v Speaker 2>It needs to be stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I spoke at mcmaster university last</v>

64
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.033
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the profane chapters students under the </v>

65
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:12.124
<v Speaker 2>spell of the reprehensible professors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideological idiocy insisted </v>

66
00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:19.330
<v Speaker 2>repetitively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is where we draw the line.</v>

67
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.310
<v Speaker 2>This is where we draw the line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is where we draw the line referring</v>

68
00:04:24.311 --> 00:04:25.144
<v Speaker 2>to my hypothetical bigotry and uncaring </v>
<v Speaker 2>attitude towards the individuals they </v>

69
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:29.363
<v Speaker 2>reported to represent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Today I want to draw a line of my own </v>

70
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.240
<v Speaker 2>and I encourage you to join me.</v>

71
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.073
<v Speaker 2>In doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to bring the confused </v>

72
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.333
<v Speaker 2>historically ignorant and resentful </v>
<v Speaker 2>purveyors of the terrible doctrine of </v>

73
00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 2>equality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of outcome to a halt.</v>

74
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.923
<v Speaker 2>We have to draw a line before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>functional structures that make up our </v>

75
00:04:49.601 --> 00:04:53.200
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our underminded damaged beyond repair.</v>

76
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.920
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to talk to you today about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the great errors,</v>

77
00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:57.754
<v Speaker 2>the self,</v>
<v Speaker 2>righteously caring attitude of the </v>

78
00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:00.364
<v Speaker 2>equity purveyors hide within the </v>
<v Speaker 2>confines of their low resolution in </v>

79
00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:08.050
<v Speaker 2>cautious elder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rhythmic ideological propaganda.</v>

80
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.663
<v Speaker 2>I cannot present a complete argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can at least help like the </v>

81
00:05:11.861 --> 00:05:16.060
<v Speaker 2>territory that must be mapped in more </v>
<v Speaker 2>detail and publicize broadly</v>

82
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.483
<v Speaker 2>for Dan takes hypothetically well </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning people on the left had been </v>

83
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:22.834
<v Speaker 2>beating the drum for a society where </v>
<v Speaker 2>equality of opportunity is the norm by </v>

84
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.053
<v Speaker 2>large.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is also a goal supported by people </v>

85
00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:32.200
<v Speaker 2>in the political center and on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

86
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.640
<v Speaker 2>Society is better served in individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>better provided with the means of moving</v>

87
00:05:36.641 --> 00:05:41.620
<v Speaker 2>forward forthrightly and with hope when </v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitrary impediments to the realization</v>

88
00:05:41.621 --> 00:05:45.550
<v Speaker 2>of their abilities are eliminated to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>degree that is possible.</v>

89
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.883
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the elimination of inequities </v>

90
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.680
<v Speaker 2>related to opportunity is something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>must be attempted with all new carer.</v>

91
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.103
<v Speaker 2>The ability to raise children </v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughtfully and carefully and to </v>

92
00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:02.420
<v Speaker 2>provide them with high quality </v>
<v Speaker 2>education,</v>

93
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:03.283
<v Speaker 2>social networks and the opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>develop their own skills and interests </v>

94
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.980
<v Speaker 2>is not something equally distributed </v>
<v Speaker 2>among all parents.</v>

95
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:11.723
<v Speaker 2>It's beans that some children will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>provided with opportunities that others </v>

96
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.273
<v Speaker 2>will lack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Governmental or other organizations may </v>

97
00:06:17.691 --> 00:06:19.940
<v Speaker 2>attempt to provide redress for such </v>
<v Speaker 2>inequality,</v>

98
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.983
<v Speaker 2>but that's done at some risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A substantial proportion of what has </v>

99
00:06:24.111 --> 00:06:28.850
<v Speaker 2>done positively for children and good </v>
<v Speaker 2>families occurs at such a young age.</v>

100
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:29.773
<v Speaker 2>The government intervention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however well meaning would mean </v>

101
00:06:32.331 --> 00:06:35.830
<v Speaker 2>invasion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>occupation and colonization of the sound</v>

102
00:06:35.831 --> 00:06:39.380
<v Speaker 2>salmon to a degree like they do produce </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative consequences.</v>

103
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.620
<v Speaker 2>It's far outweigh whatever positive good</v>
<v Speaker 2>might be done.</v>

104
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.490
<v Speaker 2>A good rule is done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be that nervous society,</v>

105
00:06:45.491 --> 00:06:46.324
<v Speaker 2>you should strive to do whatever good to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be done for disadvantaged children and </v>

106
00:06:49.491 --> 00:06:50.510
<v Speaker 2>their parents.</v>

107
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.230
<v Speaker 2>It does not civil tediously interfere </v>
<v Speaker 2>with or make more difficult.</v>

108
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.093
<v Speaker 2>The Goodman is already being done by </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents who are skilled and fortunate </v>

109
00:06:58.161 --> 00:06:58.994
<v Speaker 2>enough to do the demanding job in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>admirable and socially productive </v>

110
00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:02.954
<v Speaker 2>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Substandard debate between those on the </v>

111
00:07:05.271 --> 00:07:06.104
<v Speaker 2>left interested in broad scale social </v>
<v Speaker 2>interventions to improve life quality </v>

112
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:10.723
<v Speaker 2>for those who are less fortunate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>those on the right who wish to protect </v>

113
00:07:13.581 --> 00:07:17.540
<v Speaker 2>and maintain the integrity and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights of the family must continue.</v>

114
00:07:17.541 --> 00:07:18.374
<v Speaker 2>I'm cramming so that the dangers that </v>
<v Speaker 2>lurk on the unmoderated extremes can be </v>

115
00:07:21.921 --> 00:07:25.460
<v Speaker 2>minimized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to let any children suffer</v>

116
00:07:25.461 --> 00:07:29.060
<v Speaker 2>unnecessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want the abilities and skills.</v>

117
00:07:29.061 --> 00:07:31.910
<v Speaker 2>They might develop an offer to society </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be wasted,</v>

118
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:33.403
<v Speaker 2>but we don't want impersonal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>large scale systems suffering from the </v>

119
00:07:37.431 --> 00:07:38.264
<v Speaker 2>pathologies of gigantism to interfere </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the function of the basic family </v>

120
00:07:42.051 --> 00:07:42.884
<v Speaker 2>unit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which despite me to this inadequacies </v>

121
00:07:44.751 --> 00:07:48.770
<v Speaker 2>has yet to be replaced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even conceptually I anything remotely as</v>

122
00:07:48.771 --> 00:07:49.604
<v Speaker 2>functional.</v>

123
00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.190
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

124
00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:52.023
<v Speaker 2>The provision of universal secondary and</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a degree postsecondary education has </v>

125
00:07:56.341 --> 00:07:57.174
<v Speaker 2>11th the planes deal substantially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The safety net provided by universal </v>

126
00:08:01.631 --> 00:08:05.720
<v Speaker 2>healthcare plays the same role as does </v>
<v Speaker 2>the offering of old age pension,</v>

127
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.250
<v Speaker 2>disability allowances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unemployment insurance and welfare.</v>

128
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:10.863
<v Speaker 2>Although individuals across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>political spectrum continue to debate </v>

129
00:08:13.601 --> 00:08:14.434
<v Speaker 2>the details of size and implementation </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with such benefits of income </v>

130
00:08:18.461 --> 00:08:21.760
<v Speaker 2>redistribution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is substantial agreement among all</v>

131
00:08:21.761 --> 00:08:23.590
<v Speaker 2>regarding the essential utility.</v>

132
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.000
<v Speaker 2>It might be also noted that there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative as well as liberal and left</v>

133
00:08:30.001 --> 00:08:33.970
<v Speaker 2>wing arguments to be made in favor of </v>
<v Speaker 2>some flattening of income inequality.</v>

134
00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:35.223
<v Speaker 2>The data indicating that serious crime </v>
<v Speaker 2>including most important they nail on </v>

135
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.393
<v Speaker 2>male homicide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe driven to levels that threatened </v>

136
00:08:42.821 --> 00:08:43.654
<v Speaker 2>social stability when inequality </v>
<v Speaker 2>increases beyond some hypothetical </v>

137
00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:47.734
<v Speaker 2>optimum are solid and persuasive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thus there is a case to be made for </v>

138
00:08:51.941 --> 00:08:52.774
<v Speaker 2>enhanced social stability through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent of at least opportunity and </v>

139
00:08:57.091 --> 00:08:57.924
<v Speaker 2>perhaps I didn't come stuff as well as </v>
<v Speaker 2>the case that is made by more or less </v>

140
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:04.470
<v Speaker 2>bleeding individuals on behalf of </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstract fairness.</v>

141
00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:08.700
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are already questionable practices</v>

142
00:09:08.701 --> 00:09:11.910
<v Speaker 2>associated with improvement of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>quality of opportunity,</v>

143
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.730
<v Speaker 2>of equality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of opportunity that it be set in place.</v>

144
00:09:14.731 --> 00:09:15.564
<v Speaker 2>In addition to those over you noted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these include most particular the so </v>

145
00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:20.094
<v Speaker 2>called affirmative action programs that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have become almost universally </v>

146
00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:23.664
<v Speaker 2>instantiated into higher replaced within</v>
<v Speaker 2>promotion processes that characterize </v>

147
00:09:26.851 --> 00:09:27.684
<v Speaker 2>most large,</v>
<v Speaker 2>large modern institutions in place </v>

148
00:09:31.861 --> 00:09:35.640
<v Speaker 2>theoretically to provide redress for </v>
<v Speaker 2>historical inequalities.</v>

149
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.553
<v Speaker 2>Shows is the history of slavery that </v>
<v Speaker 2>characterize the American black </v>

150
00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:39.744
<v Speaker 2>population some six generations ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps a case can be named for such </v>

151
00:09:44.641 --> 00:09:45.474
<v Speaker 2>things as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although they are associated with clear </v>

152
00:09:47.101 --> 00:09:47.934
<v Speaker 2>dangers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most egregious of these is the </v>

153
00:09:49.681 --> 00:09:50.514
<v Speaker 2>insistence tied it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take me to the claims of those enamored </v>

154
00:09:54.811 --> 00:09:55.644
<v Speaker 2>with postmodern identity politics that </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain group oriented aspects of human </v>

155
00:09:59.041 --> 00:10:01.710
<v Speaker 2>identities such as race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex,</v>

156
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:02.693
<v Speaker 2>and now sexual proclivity of gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity are sufficiently real and </v>

157
00:10:06.091 --> 00:10:09.030
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the judgment of people on the grounds</v>

158
00:10:09.031 --> 00:10:09.864
<v Speaker 2>of the individual competence alone </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be suspended in favor of ill </v>

159
00:10:13.141 --> 00:10:13.974
<v Speaker 2>defined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Planes of social justice are the minor </v>

160
00:10:16.381 --> 00:10:17.214
<v Speaker 2>and these include statements in job </v>
<v Speaker 2>postings indicating that applications </v>

161
00:10:20.401 --> 00:10:21.234
<v Speaker 2>from individuals with certain specified </v>
<v Speaker 2>group level attributes are particularly </v>

162
00:10:25.171 --> 00:10:26.004
<v Speaker 2>welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What dangers are associated with such </v>

163
00:10:28.981 --> 00:10:31.230
<v Speaker 2>practices?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

164
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.153
<v Speaker 2>the first is that specified particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>welcome on the part of some groups </v>

165
00:10:36.121 --> 00:10:36.954
<v Speaker 2>clearly implies less welcome on the part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of others as the postmodern theorists </v>

166
00:10:40.921 --> 00:10:41.754
<v Speaker 2>who push such things forward would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>first to point out such thinkers </v>

167
00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:46.044
<v Speaker 2>constantly make the claim that value </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure is by necessity exclude and </v>

168
00:10:49.951 --> 00:10:50.910
<v Speaker 2>should be flattened.</v>

169
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:51.743
<v Speaker 2>For that reason they don't extend the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same rationale to attempts to hire a </v>

170
00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:56.490
<v Speaker 2>preferentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

171
00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:57.413
<v Speaker 2>because the Marxism that lurks behind </v>
<v Speaker 2>there hypothetically pure postmodern </v>

172
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.433
<v Speaker 2>reasoning justifies identification of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people by group identity and selection </v>

173
00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:06.414
<v Speaker 2>on that basis because of its insistence </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the dialectic of oppressor and </v>

174
00:11:09.901 --> 00:11:13.620
<v Speaker 2>oppressed characterized as all so called</v>
<v Speaker 2>power structures.</v>

175
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:15.503
<v Speaker 2>The second problem is that only a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrow subset of the wide range of </v>

176
00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:19.644
<v Speaker 2>potential group identities and therefore</v>
<v Speaker 2>group paid qualities can possibly be </v>

177
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:28.590
<v Speaker 2>identified and rectified by such </v>
<v Speaker 2>practices privileging those alphabets of</v>

178
00:11:28.591 --> 00:11:31.590
<v Speaker 2>group identity above all others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

179
00:11:31.591 --> 00:11:32.424
<v Speaker 2>using the hollowing terminology of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodernists themselves means </v>

180
00:11:35.221 --> 00:11:39.960
<v Speaker 2>instantiate those and those and only </v>
<v Speaker 2>those elements as vitally characteristic</v>

181
00:11:39.961 --> 00:11:44.961
<v Speaker 2>of the individuals in question to </v>
<v Speaker 2>encourage or select on the basis of race</v>

182
00:11:46.501 --> 00:11:47.334
<v Speaker 2>and sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other is sacred descriptors of </v>

183
00:11:49.531 --> 00:11:50.364
<v Speaker 2>the modern anti individual left is </v>
<v Speaker 2>similar tediously to insist that those </v>

184
00:11:54.461 --> 00:11:57.640
<v Speaker 2>are the categories upon which people </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be judged.</v>

185
00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.133
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't take much in the way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence and insight to see how </v>

186
00:12:02.891 --> 00:12:03.724
<v Speaker 2>easily this process can be reversed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>used in the opposite direction by those </v>

187
00:12:08.051 --> 00:12:08.884
<v Speaker 2>on the radical right who might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>inclined to insist that ration sex are </v>

188
00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:13.534
<v Speaker 2>precisely the relevant categories by </v>
<v Speaker 2>which people should be judged for the </v>

189
00:12:17.351 --> 00:12:21.170
<v Speaker 2>very purposes of exclusion and </v>
<v Speaker 2>prejudicial discrimination.</v>

190
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:24.970
<v Speaker 2>Those on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically oppose with sauce for the</v>

191
00:12:24.971 --> 00:12:26.800
<v Speaker 2>goose is sauce for the Gander.</v>

192
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.033
<v Speaker 2>Such a reversal is making itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>currently manifest in the increasing </v>

193
00:12:33.821 --> 00:12:36.370
<v Speaker 2>proclivity of those attacked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

194
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:41.430
<v Speaker 2>for their quote white privilege and </v>
<v Speaker 2>quote to start insisting on their racial</v>

195
00:12:41.441 --> 00:12:42.274
<v Speaker 2>identity as a primary hallmark and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>shift from guilt to overt claims of </v>

196
00:12:47.441 --> 00:12:51.370
<v Speaker 2>supremacy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else could we get possibly expect?</v>

197
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:52.623
<v Speaker 2>Something very similar happened with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>black power and black is beautiful </v>

198
00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:56.374
<v Speaker 2>movements in the late sixties and early </v>
<v Speaker 2>seventies the third problem is the </v>

199
00:13:01.361 --> 00:13:02.194
<v Speaker 2>tendency for demands for equality of </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to devolve evermore rapidly </v>

200
00:13:06.521 --> 00:13:07.354
<v Speaker 2>in serious into demands for equity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has now become defined as </v>

201
00:13:10.901 --> 00:13:12.820
<v Speaker 2>equality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not opportunity,</v>

202
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:13.683
<v Speaker 2>but the outcome itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is happening currently at a rate </v>

203
00:13:16.901 --> 00:13:21.460
<v Speaker 2>that beggars belief give the absolute </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophes that social,</v>

204
00:13:21.461 --> 00:13:22.294
<v Speaker 2>economic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and political policies predicated on </v>

205
00:13:24.521 --> 00:13:27.340
<v Speaker 2>equality of outcome have produced in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>past.</v>

206
00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:32.470
<v Speaker 2>What does equity mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's predicated on two ideas,</v>

207
00:13:32.471 --> 00:13:33.304
<v Speaker 2>each more pernicious than the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first is that all social </v>

208
00:13:36.101 --> 00:13:36.934
<v Speaker 2>institutions must produce outcomes of </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever sort that are precisely equal </v>

209
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.870
<v Speaker 2>across all possible group identities.</v>

210
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:49.210
<v Speaker 2>The second is that social institutions </v>
<v Speaker 2>that do not produce those equal outcomes</v>

211
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.600
<v Speaker 2>do not produce them because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>institutional racism,</v>

212
00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:54.730
<v Speaker 2>sexism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or other ism.</v>

213
00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:55.773
<v Speaker 2>That is as well characteristic of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>explicit and implicit prejudices of </v>

214
00:14:00.281 --> 00:14:03.480
<v Speaker 2>those individuals who make up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>institutions of questions.</v>

215
00:14:03.481 --> 00:14:04.314
<v Speaker 2>Health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a number of logical reasons </v>

216
00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:09.940
<v Speaker 2>why sex demands cannot be net and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not desirable.</v>

217
00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:10.803
<v Speaker 2>Even in principle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Surrounding those logical reasons is a </v>

218
00:14:13.631 --> 00:14:18.631
<v Speaker 2>plethora of historical data indicating </v>
<v Speaker 2>most recently in Venezuela that economic</v>

219
00:14:19.841 --> 00:14:24.340
<v Speaker 2>policies predicated on the idea of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>radical equality are catastrophic.</v>

220
00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:25.533
<v Speaker 2>Even genocidal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll start with the logical reasons to </v>

221
00:14:29.861 --> 00:14:33.820
<v Speaker 2>determine whether or not a given </v>
<v Speaker 2>institution is inequitable.</v>

222
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:34.833
<v Speaker 2>The institution is first stratified </v>
<v Speaker 2>according to the hypothetical privilege </v>

223
00:14:38.861 --> 00:14:39.694
<v Speaker 2>and power get awards to different </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals who occupied different </v>

224
00:14:42.581 --> 00:14:43.414
<v Speaker 2>positions within it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the demographic makeup of those </v>

225
00:14:47.591 --> 00:14:50.650
<v Speaker 2>strata are analyzed along lines of </v>
<v Speaker 2>racial,</v>

226
00:14:50.651 --> 00:14:51.484
<v Speaker 2>ethnic and gender identity as well as </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual proclivity and contrast it with </v>

227
00:14:56.511 --> 00:14:57.344
<v Speaker 2>the demographics that have obtain in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>general population surrounding the </v>

228
00:15:00.681 --> 00:15:01.640
<v Speaker 2>institution.</v>

229
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

230
00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.540
<v Speaker 2>What is wrong with this</v>

231
00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.360
<v Speaker 1>first</v>

232
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:10.240
<v Speaker 2>section?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Analysis are predicated on the idea that</v>

233
00:15:10.241 --> 00:15:15.241
<v Speaker 2>institutions primarily the function to </v>
<v Speaker 2>distribute resources and reward.</v>

234
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.983
<v Speaker 2>That's only one of the many functions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a hallmark of the kind of </v>

235
00:15:20.261 --> 00:15:24.220
<v Speaker 2>ideologically rigid conceptualization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dry such assessments.</v>

236
00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.113
<v Speaker 2>Then only one factor is ever considered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This makes being right and being self </v>

237
00:15:29.381 --> 00:15:32.230
<v Speaker 2>righteous above it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very straight forward manner,</v>

238
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:33.543
<v Speaker 2>radically and observing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reducing the cognitive demands that a </v>

239
00:15:35.921 --> 00:15:38.410
<v Speaker 2>truly comprehensive analysis would </v>
<v Speaker 2>require.</v>

240
00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:39.483
<v Speaker 2>Complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchical social organizations are </v>

241
00:15:42.431 --> 00:15:43.264
<v Speaker 2>not simply your mechanisms for </v>
<v Speaker 2>distributing resources and rewards nor </v>

242
00:15:47.981 --> 00:15:51.990
<v Speaker 2>are they in case it needs to be said </v>
<v Speaker 2>merely structures of power,</v>

243
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:56.380
<v Speaker 2>privilege and oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are in part of course both of these</v>

244
00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.860
<v Speaker 2>until radica societies they be mostly </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

245
00:15:59.861 --> 00:16:03.270
<v Speaker 2>Both of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my name is functional.</v>

246
00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.070
<v Speaker 2>It's free societies</v>

247
00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.430
<v Speaker 2>such as those that primarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>characterize the west.</v>

248
00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:11.293
<v Speaker 2>Despite it's flaws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are also structures of </v>

249
00:16:13.521 --> 00:16:18.521
<v Speaker 2>responsibility and production.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The evidence for this is overwhelming by</v>

250
00:16:19.161 --> 00:16:24.161
<v Speaker 2>historical and current world standards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People in the West will house and wealth</v>

251
00:16:25.241 --> 00:16:26.900
<v Speaker 2>stay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

252
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.033
<v Speaker 2>we're more currently threatened Michael </v>
<v Speaker 2>obesity than by starvation with few </v>

253
00:16:32.181 --> 00:16:35.500
<v Speaker 2>exceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone has indoor plumbing,</v>

254
00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:36.363
<v Speaker 2>central heating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>access to education and connections to </v>

255
00:16:39.231 --> 00:16:40.064
<v Speaker 2>the worldwide web,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which provides on an entirely rely on a </v>

256
00:16:42.931 --> 00:16:47.931
<v Speaker 2>basis more information at lower cost and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this ever been available previously.</v>

257
00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:53.450
<v Speaker 2>The fact that the West does this with </v>
<v Speaker 2>great efficiency comparatively speaking,</v>

258
00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:54.343
<v Speaker 2>can be seen in the fact that immigrants </v>
<v Speaker 2>move virtually without exception from </v>

259
00:16:58.141 --> 00:17:03.141
<v Speaker 2>the great balls of dysfunctional to </v>
<v Speaker 2>radica societies from all over the world</v>

260
00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.740
<v Speaker 2>to the comparatively freedom productive </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries of Europe,</v>

261
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.890
<v Speaker 2>North America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia and New Zealand.</v>

262
00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:11.750
<v Speaker 2>And not the reverse.</v>

263
00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.410
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

264
00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.113
<v Speaker 2>are complex social tools of production </v>
<v Speaker 2>make and do things and we'll report </v>

265
00:17:25.581 --> 00:17:26.414
<v Speaker 2>bleed maybe and do things the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>want regardless of what might be </v>

266
00:17:30.561 --> 00:17:33.560
<v Speaker 2>regarded as their consumers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Triviality.</v>

267
00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:38.620
<v Speaker 2>No centrally planned economy produces a </v>
<v Speaker 2>selection of shampoos or toothbrushes or</v>

268
00:17:39.501 --> 00:17:40.334
<v Speaker 2>automatic and watch blinders were kite </v>
<v Speaker 2>surfing kinds of things or lightweight </v>

269
00:17:43.431 --> 00:17:44.264
<v Speaker 2>bicycles or video games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A hardy minded and judgmental social </v>

270
00:17:47.661 --> 00:17:52.530
<v Speaker 2>justice advocate might dispute this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Such a hyper productionist trivial,</v>

271
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:57.330
<v Speaker 2>but it's still very likely to spend </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours per day texting his or her friends</v>

272
00:17:57.331 --> 00:17:58.164
<v Speaker 2>and desirable political cliches on </v>
<v Speaker 2>expensive I iphones and androids one </v>

273
00:18:03.241 --> 00:18:04.074
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meat is another man's poison is by no </v>

274
00:18:06.301 --> 00:18:07.134
<v Speaker 2>means clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who should judge whether something that </v>

275
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.473
<v Speaker 2>someone else desires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe acceptably produced in a world </v>

276
00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:15.480
<v Speaker 2>where absolute privation still exists.</v>

277
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.880
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

278
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.713
<v Speaker 2>Because our hierarchical organizations </v>
<v Speaker 2>make new things that people want and </v>

279
00:18:22.441 --> 00:18:24.570
<v Speaker 2>because the people differ in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>competence.</v>

280
00:18:24.571 --> 00:18:25.404
<v Speaker 2>In doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different people experience different </v>

281
00:18:27.481 --> 00:18:31.740
<v Speaker 2>demand for their services.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We adjudicate such demand with pay.</v>

282
00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:32.693
<v Speaker 2>This is the alternative to slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you are producing things that people </v>

283
00:18:37.801 --> 00:18:38.634
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you are entitled to charge what </v>

284
00:18:40.621 --> 00:18:41.454
<v Speaker 2>people are willing to pay for your </v>
<v Speaker 2>services or to refuse to provide such </v>

285
00:18:45.181 --> 00:18:48.060
<v Speaker 2>services at your whim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you choose,</v>

286
00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:52.920
<v Speaker 2>you get this privilege because what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>provide for other people as value and it</v>

287
00:18:52.921 --> 00:18:57.150
<v Speaker 2>is therefore useful for other people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>encourage you to continue to provide it.</v>

288
00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.133
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to buy your offering </v>
<v Speaker 2>either anymore than you have to produce </v>

289
00:19:01.171 --> 00:19:02.004
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although that's not the very definition </v>

290
00:19:03.721 --> 00:19:07.110
<v Speaker 2>of freedom is certainly constitutes an </v>
<v Speaker 2>important element of freedom.</v>

291
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:08.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

292
00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.800
<v Speaker 2>Because some people are more confident </v>
<v Speaker 2>making or doing those things,</v>

293
00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.650
<v Speaker 2>they can demand a higher price for their</v>
<v Speaker 2>participation.</v>

294
00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.070
<v Speaker 2>This is because of what they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>offering,</v>

295
00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.140
<v Speaker 2>not because of what they intrinsically </v>
<v Speaker 2>deserve.</v>

296
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.633
<v Speaker 2>It may be the case that I'm early </v>
<v Speaker 2>elements of identity determined to some </v>

297
00:19:27.081 --> 00:19:31.790
<v Speaker 2>degree the differential probability that</v>
<v Speaker 2>any given individual will come to occupy</v>

298
00:19:31.791 --> 00:19:35.180
<v Speaker 2>a place for he or she can offer the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fruits of their labor.</v>

299
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:36.103
<v Speaker 2>But if there's also the case that their </v>
<v Speaker 2>skill at production is a major </v>

300
00:19:38.331 --> 00:19:39.164
<v Speaker 2>contributor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the demonstrated empirically </v>

301
00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.060
<v Speaker 2>complex jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>administrative,</v>

302
00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.180
<v Speaker 2>managerial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nonacademic required,</v>

303
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:47.103
<v Speaker 2>high intelligence and high levels of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>big five personality trait </v>

304
00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:50.863
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness that most careful of </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychometric investigations into such </v>

305
00:19:54.831 --> 00:19:55.664
<v Speaker 2>things have clearly demonstrated that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>combination of intelligence and </v>

306
00:19:58.611 --> 00:19:59.444
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which can both be accurately measured </v>

307
00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:06.560
<v Speaker 2>correlates at about 0.6 with longterm </v>
<v Speaker 2>life success in such occupations,</v>

308
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:07.663
<v Speaker 2>some of the remaining variation in </v>
<v Speaker 2>success can be attributed to random </v>

309
00:20:10.461 --> 00:20:11.294
<v Speaker 2>factors such as health and even </v>
<v Speaker 2>counterproductive of fair systemic </v>

310
00:20:15.711 --> 00:20:16.544
<v Speaker 2>prejudice alone with a fair degree of </v>
<v Speaker 2>measurement error as productivity and </v>

311
00:20:19.761 --> 00:20:22.280
<v Speaker 2>success for notoriously hard to </v>
<v Speaker 2>quantify.</v>

312
00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:23.240
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nonetheless,</v>

313
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:24.103
<v Speaker 2>correlations of that magnitude are </v>
<v Speaker 2>exceptionally rare in the social and </v>

314
00:20:27.021 --> 00:20:31.250
<v Speaker 2>health sciences and they are not to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>easily and carelessly dismissed.</v>

315
00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:32.623
<v Speaker 2>The same thing can be said with regards </v>
<v Speaker 2>to success and entrepreneurial and </v>

316
00:20:35.211 --> 00:20:36.044
<v Speaker 2>creative endeavors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which when complex also require </v>

317
00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:42.200
<v Speaker 2>intelligence but demand big five traits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>openness,</v>

318
00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:43.093
<v Speaker 2>which is a dimension indexing capacity </v>
<v Speaker 2>to produce novel ideas and perceptual </v>

319
00:20:46.521 --> 00:20:47.354
<v Speaker 2>frames.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To the degree that traits obviously </v>

320
00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:54.430
<v Speaker 2>logically lead to productive success </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually predict steps to success.</v>

321
00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:59.290
<v Speaker 2>The systems in which success such </v>
<v Speaker 2>success manifests itself can be regarded</v>

322
00:20:59.291 --> 00:21:02.860
<v Speaker 2>as examples of fair and reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 2>gauge.</v>

323
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.233
<v Speaker 2>It should also be pointed out that many </v>
<v Speaker 2>said games exist so that people who are </v>

324
00:21:07.781 --> 00:21:12.781
<v Speaker 2>not conscientious or intelligent work </v>
<v Speaker 2>creative still have the chance to win it</v>

325
00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:14.043
<v Speaker 2>popularity and say it desire for vision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>time in the formulation of close </v>

326
00:21:18.341 --> 00:21:21.260
<v Speaker 2>interpersonal relationships are in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>provision of safety,</v>

327
00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:22.123
<v Speaker 2>insecurity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these other domains of potential </v>

328
00:21:23.711 --> 00:21:24.544
<v Speaker 2>achievement or differentially valued by </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in accordance with their </v>

329
00:21:26.951 --> 00:21:29.020
<v Speaker 2>intrinsic traits of personality.</v>

330
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:33.880
<v Speaker 2>This means that a person who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>primarily agreeable for example,</v>

331
00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:34.743
<v Speaker 2>may well choose to maximize their </v>
<v Speaker 2>engagement in interpersonal </v>

332
00:21:37.541 --> 00:21:41.260
<v Speaker 2>relationships out the cost of career or </v>
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurial success,</v>

333
00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.500
<v Speaker 2>and who is to say that's not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable trade off.</v>

334
00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:46.223
<v Speaker 2>It is also the case that there are many </v>
<v Speaker 2>more elements of group identity that </v>

335
00:21:49.961 --> 00:21:50.794
<v Speaker 2>must be reasonably considered if the </v>
<v Speaker 2>case could be made that the elements of </v>

336
00:21:54.431 --> 00:21:56.290
<v Speaker 2>race and sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

337
00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:57.183
<v Speaker 2>must be considered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are differentially successful </v>

338
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:04.660
<v Speaker 2>because they are older.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Older people are wealthier.</v>

339
00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:05.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

340
00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:06.813
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they've had their whole life to </v>

341
00:22:07.721 --> 00:22:10.690
<v Speaker 2>generate wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that fair or unfair?</v>

342
00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.480
<v Speaker 2>Should it be rectified or is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable?</v>

343
00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.540
<v Speaker 2>There are younger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're better at sports.</v>

344
00:22:16.541 --> 00:22:17.374
<v Speaker 2>If you're younger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're more likely to attract sexual </v>

345
00:22:18.911 --> 00:22:19.744
<v Speaker 2>partners if you're younger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some things are better for men and some </v>

346
00:22:22.441 --> 00:22:23.274
<v Speaker 2>things are better for women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some things are better for attractive </v>

347
00:22:25.691 --> 00:22:26.380
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

348
00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.213
<v Speaker 2>Some things are better for people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are up the majority race or religion or </v>

349
00:22:30.221 --> 00:22:31.054
<v Speaker 2>tribe or language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some things are more accessible to </v>

350
00:22:35.021 --> 00:22:37.540
<v Speaker 2>unattractive people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so character acting,</v>

351
00:22:37.541 --> 00:22:39.610
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>falls into that category.</v>

352
00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:43.420
<v Speaker 2>People have different interests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have different education.</v>

353
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:44.343
<v Speaker 2>People have different levels of mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>and physical health and people </v>

354
00:22:46.841 --> 00:22:49.930
<v Speaker 2>differentially regulate their use of </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs and alcohol.</v>

355
00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:50.793
<v Speaker 2>Those are all dimensions upon which </v>
<v Speaker 2>people can be categorized by group and </v>

356
00:22:54.071 --> 00:22:56.110
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason to privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 2>race,</v>

357
00:22:56.111 --> 00:22:57.910
<v Speaker 2>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual identity,</v>

358
00:22:57.911 --> 00:23:01.770
<v Speaker 2>gender identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender expression and um,</v>

359
00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:08.830
<v Speaker 2>above these other dimensions of group </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity which are equally valuable,</v>

360
00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:12.340
<v Speaker 2>which are equally valid and play into </v>
<v Speaker 2>who we important role.</v>

361
00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.210
<v Speaker 2>People judge different outcomes as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different worth,</v>

362
00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:19.030
<v Speaker 2>love children's leisure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>

363
00:23:19.031 --> 00:23:20.860
<v Speaker 2>duty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>surface pleasure,</v>

364
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:22.630
<v Speaker 2>aesthetics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>novelty,</v>

365
00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:23.493
<v Speaker 2>spirituality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these factors and many more to </v>

366
00:23:26.591 --> 00:23:27.424
<v Speaker 2>determine inequitable outcomes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How then should people be properly </v>

367
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:34.300
<v Speaker 2>categorized to ensure equity?</v>

368
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.793
<v Speaker 2>Even a small set of entities can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>categorized in near infinite number of </v>

369
00:23:38.981 --> 00:23:39.814
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's going to measure all these </v>

370
00:23:40.871 --> 00:23:41.704
<v Speaker 2>differences?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's going to determine which of them </v>

371
00:23:43.991 --> 00:23:44.824
<v Speaker 2>are important and which of a mark who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to measure the outcomes and some </v>

372
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.153
<v Speaker 2>of the up to complicate issues further,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is going to determine whether they </v>

373
00:23:53.871 --> 00:23:58.640
<v Speaker 2>are biologically instantiated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>socially constructed or mere choice?</v>

374
00:23:58.670 --> 00:23:59.503
<v Speaker 2>Apparently like gender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they mutable or fixed and </v>

375
00:24:03.711 --> 00:24:04.544
<v Speaker 2>deterministic if they're immutable </v>
<v Speaker 2>merely as a matter of choice as </v>

376
00:24:08.601 --> 00:24:10.350
<v Speaker 2>legislation in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

377
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:11.780
<v Speaker 2>incest is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

378
00:24:11.781 --> 00:24:12.614
<v Speaker 2>with regards to gender identity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>gender expression that should those </v>

379
00:24:15.741 --> 00:24:19.640
<v Speaker 2>differences and also be regarded as </v>
<v Speaker 2>relevant determinants of an equity.</v>

380
00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:20.863
<v Speaker 2>If people could make change their hope </v>
<v Speaker 2>categorization merely as a consequence </v>

381
00:24:24.261 --> 00:24:25.094
<v Speaker 2>of an act of will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you consider that a relevant </v>

382
00:24:27.291 --> 00:24:30.260
<v Speaker 2>category to determine levels of </v>
<v Speaker 2>inequality?</v>

383
00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:34.070
<v Speaker 2>Furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's going to measure and determine the</v>

384
00:24:34.071 --> 00:24:34.904
<v Speaker 2>rewards?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are we going to insist that everyone </v>

385
00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:42.730
<v Speaker 2>must be equally posture and outgoing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>equally assertive and enthusiastic,</v>

386
00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:43.993
<v Speaker 2>equally private and introverted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carrington polite or demanding and </v>

387
00:24:47.991 --> 00:24:50.300
<v Speaker 2>competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>industrious and orderly,</v>

388
00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.670
<v Speaker 2>creative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in ideas.</v>

389
00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:56.090
<v Speaker 2>What are those outcomes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Less important or less worthy of note,</v>

390
00:24:56.091 --> 00:24:59.120
<v Speaker 2>that corporate position or economic </v>
<v Speaker 2>compensation,</v>

391
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:03.880
<v Speaker 2>are we going to swallow without </v>
<v Speaker 2>question?</v>

392
00:25:03.881 --> 00:25:04.714
<v Speaker 2>The idea that career position in </v>
<v Speaker 2>monetary gain or the old be Jenkin </v>

393
00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:11.550
<v Speaker 2>values that exist that should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>considered that are worthy of merit.</v>

394
00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:16.950
<v Speaker 2>It's a very strange thing for those on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the radical left to insist that the very</v>

395
00:25:17.081 --> 00:25:17.914
<v Speaker 2>criteria by which large corporations </v>
<v Speaker 2>judge the utility of individuals are </v>

396
00:25:22.031 --> 00:25:25.420
<v Speaker 2>precisely those that should be used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>assess equality of outcomes,</v>

397
00:25:25.421 --> 00:25:30.040
<v Speaker 2>fairness and diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say it again.</v>

398
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:35.430
<v Speaker 2>It isn't what you deserve for intrinsic </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons that determines your outcome.</v>

399
00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:40.120
<v Speaker 2>It's the word that others attributed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>your offerings.</v>

400
00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:45.210
<v Speaker 2>Think of an offering on Ebay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No sellers says,</v>

401
00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:46.563
<v Speaker 2>I am Azur Bay Sham and my mother was had</v>
<v Speaker 2>mother has Alzheimer's and I'm not well </v>

402
00:25:51.341 --> 00:25:52.174
<v Speaker 2>educated but I tall and strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although not very attractive and I was </v>

403
00:25:55.721 --> 00:25:58.330
<v Speaker 2>bullied as a child but I'm quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>musical.</v>

404
00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:59.193
<v Speaker 2>Although I only have one print and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>slightly overweight and prone to </v>

405
00:26:02.471 --> 00:26:03.304
<v Speaker 2>anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have to pay the $50 for my </v>

406
00:26:05.711 --> 00:26:07.360
<v Speaker 2>secondhand crock pot.</v>

407
00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:13.970
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

408
00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:19.603
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead I have this item and you don't </v>

409
00:26:23.421 --> 00:26:24.254
<v Speaker 2>care who I am and I don't care who you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are except that I would describe it </v>

410
00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:31.340
<v Speaker 2>honestly and ship it and you will pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>

411
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:36.500
<v Speaker 2>You can agree on a mutually beneficial </v>
<v Speaker 2>price that's trade.</v>

412
00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:41.510
<v Speaker 2>The reward runs both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trade is not charity.</v>

413
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:43.063
<v Speaker 2>Trade is mutually beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trade does not and cannot rectify </v>

414
00:26:47.071 --> 00:26:47.904
<v Speaker 2>historical or biological injustices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can only hardly and momentarily </v>

415
00:26:52.921 --> 00:26:53.754
<v Speaker 2>satisfying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people engaged in the particular </v>

416
00:26:55.771 --> 00:26:56.604
<v Speaker 2>trade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Attempts to redistribute through trade </v>

417
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.593
<v Speaker 2>tend to kick it back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that is the way people there </v>

418
00:27:03.781 --> 00:27:08.781
<v Speaker 2>have now lost an average of 18 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cuba can barely feed itself.</v>

419
00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:13.020
<v Speaker 2>Everything is running down and barely </v>
<v Speaker 2>functional.</v>

420
00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:14.393
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the most comical things </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen in recent years was the motor </v>

421
00:27:17.191 --> 00:27:22.191
<v Speaker 2>convoy transferring Fidel Castro's </v>
<v Speaker 2>damned corpse to the,</v>

422
00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.030
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

423
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:27.500
<v Speaker 2>to the cemetery breaking down in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of the front</v>

424
00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:28.403
<v Speaker 1>session.</v>

425
00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:37.180
<v Speaker 2>Everything is run down in Belize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>functionable.</v>

426
00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:38.253
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the problem of distribution is </v>

427
00:27:40.451 --> 00:27:44.980
<v Speaker 2>so complex that it has to be outsourced </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the collective intelligence.</v>

428
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:46.023
<v Speaker 2>Knows person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>group of persons or imaginable </v>

429
00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:54.400
<v Speaker 2>computational device can perform the </v>
<v Speaker 2>calculations of the price.</v>

430
00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:59.520
<v Speaker 2>The measurements can even be made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is because of the price of anything</v>

431
00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:03.400
<v Speaker 2>is dependent on the price of everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

432
00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:08.760
<v Speaker 2>And to make it worse is always shifting </v>
<v Speaker 2>flawed as the free market system is.</v>

433
00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:11.013
<v Speaker 2>We don't have anything better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's say instead we transfer </v>

434
00:28:15.711 --> 00:28:18.160
<v Speaker 2>determination of power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>status,</v>

435
00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:21.190
<v Speaker 2>privilege and desire to a group of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

436
00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:22.683
<v Speaker 2>What group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we regulate their biases and </v>

437
00:28:25.331 --> 00:28:28.240
<v Speaker 2>correct for the rape?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's how do we limit their power,</v>

438
00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:31.840
<v Speaker 2>how do we protect ourselves against </v>
<v Speaker 2>their ideologies and hatred?</v>

439
00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:32.683
<v Speaker 2>And entrance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we discriminate the desire to </v>

440
00:28:35.531 --> 00:28:36.364
<v Speaker 2>help the unfortunate from the wish to </v>
<v Speaker 2>destroying the weld constituted and </v>

441
00:28:40.931 --> 00:28:41.950
<v Speaker 2>successful?</v>

442
00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:43.563
<v Speaker 2>We don't and we can't and we won't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we'll have those basket political </v>

443
00:28:50.711 --> 00:28:53.860
<v Speaker 2>maneuvering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most convinced of their righteousness,</v>

444
00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:57.670
<v Speaker 2>least aware of their ignorance and </v>
<v Speaker 2>limitations of knowledge.</v>

445
00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:58.783
<v Speaker 2>And Sue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most filled with resentment and hatred </v>

446
00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:04.840
<v Speaker 2>will instantly rise to dominate such </v>
<v Speaker 2>positions.</v>

447
00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:09.010
<v Speaker 2>And then all hell will break on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we know this?</v>

448
00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:14.400
<v Speaker 2>Because it already happened and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed 100 million people.</v>

449
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:18.400
<v Speaker 2>And maybe I'm told the others destitute </v>
<v Speaker 2>and miserable,</v>

450
00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:23.520
<v Speaker 2>and it just about destroyed the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We already ran this experiment and fail,</v>

451
00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:30.100
<v Speaker 2>and then we ran it again and it fail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we ran it again.</v>

452
00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:33.820
<v Speaker 2>And then they fail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we replicated the failure.</v>

453
00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:34.743
<v Speaker 2>No one who was not eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your rent would dare to experiment </v>

454
00:29:38.291 --> 00:29:39.910
<v Speaker 2>concepts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things again,</v>

455
00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:44.470
<v Speaker 2>unless they were malevolent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So which it is,</v>

456
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:49.500
<v Speaker 2>which isn't youth purveyor as an equity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You merchants of yesterday's poison.</v>

457
00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.240
<v Speaker 2>Are you ignorant or 1100</v>

458
00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:57.760
