1
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.640
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to read something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature road in the first part of beyond</v>

2
00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:14.060
<v Speaker 1>good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a section called the prejudices</v>

3
00:00:14.061 --> 00:00:19.061
<v Speaker 1>of philosophers and it's a really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>example of the dance density.</v>

4
00:00:19.871 --> 00:00:24.450
<v Speaker 1>The of this book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the ways of conceptualizing</v>

5
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:27.090
<v Speaker 1>beyond good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is true for most great</v>

6
00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:27.924
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

7
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.090
<v Speaker 1>it's true [inaudible] works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that</v>

8
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.223
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

9
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.390
<v Speaker 1>author of the work</v>
<v Speaker 1>collects unconsciously collects patterns</v>

10
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.400
<v Speaker 1>from his or her interaction with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and then give them initial</v>

11
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:51.390
<v Speaker 1>formulation</v>

12
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.670
<v Speaker 1>and the patterns can be deep and</v>
<v Speaker 1>multilevel.</v>

13
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.950
<v Speaker 1>And the initial formulation translates</v>
<v Speaker 1>them into not so much ideas as into the</v>

14
00:01:06.711 --> 00:01:11.711
<v Speaker 1>seeds of future ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the more poetic the author happens</v>

15
00:01:12.621 --> 00:01:15.860
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more the case that his or her</v>

16
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.460
<v Speaker 1>writings contain within it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The seeds of future ideas and one of the</v>

17
00:01:21.771 --> 00:01:26.450
<v Speaker 1>romantic philosophers are authors and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think niche industry have ski or are in</v>

18
00:01:26.451 --> 00:01:30.680
<v Speaker 1>some sense foremost among them are</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly notable.</v>

19
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.710
<v Speaker 1>Further ability to do exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in this particular paragraph,</v>

20
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.190
<v Speaker 1>this particular paragraph not only</v>
<v Speaker 1>serves as an example of that,</v>

21
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.180
<v Speaker 1>but it also serves as the self conscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflection on that because Nietzsche is</v>

22
00:01:46.311 --> 00:01:51.311
<v Speaker 1>writing a paragraph here that is full of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the seeds of ideas that will actually</v>

23
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.570
<v Speaker 1>bloom and flower to a great degree in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century,</v>

24
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.590
<v Speaker 1>but well he cymbalta caneously revealing</v>
<v Speaker 1>these those ideas.</v>

25
00:02:00.591 --> 00:02:04.160
<v Speaker 1>He's also telling you exactly how he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it and how it is that philosophers</v>

26
00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:04.880
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

27
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.000
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a spectacular accomplishment.</v>

28
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to read it probably phrase by</v>
<v Speaker 1>phrase and then take it apart because</v>

29
00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:16.850
<v Speaker 1>it's so dance and beyond good and evil</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like that.</v>

30
00:02:16.851 --> 00:02:19.280
<v Speaker 1>It's neat you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Nisha was writing beyond good and</v>

31
00:02:19.281 --> 00:02:23.750
<v Speaker 1>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't very well and because of that</v>

32
00:02:23.751 --> 00:02:27.080
<v Speaker 1>he had to spend a lot of time thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not very much time writing and</v>

33
00:02:27.081 --> 00:02:30.410
<v Speaker 1>because he was also brilliant beyond</v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehension,</v>

34
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.920
<v Speaker 1>his ability to distill what he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking into incredibly rich phrases is</v>

35
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.360
<v Speaker 1>I think it's some sense it's beyond</v>
<v Speaker 1>parallel.</v>

36
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean often if I'm reading a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it has any utility at all market,</v>

37
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.940
<v Speaker 1>usually I fold over the top of the page</v>
<v Speaker 1>or sometimes put a yellow sticky note on</v>

38
00:02:52.941 --> 00:02:55.580
<v Speaker 1>it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I find a place where there's an idea</v>

39
00:02:55.581 --> 00:02:58.320
<v Speaker 1>that's worth returning to that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

40
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.820
<v Speaker 1>it's particularly worth understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can't do that with a book like</v>

41
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 1>beyond good and evil because what ends</v>
<v Speaker 1>up happening is you have to mark every</v>

42
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:10.800
<v Speaker 1>sentence and obviously marking every</v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence isn't any better than not</v>

43
00:03:10.801 --> 00:03:13.720
<v Speaker 1>marking any sentences at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

44
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.890
<v Speaker 1>I guess I also might as well tell you</v>
<v Speaker 1>why it is worth bothering with a book</v>

45
00:03:27.891 --> 00:03:31.590
<v Speaker 1>like this at all because it's a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult book and it,</v>

46
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.330
<v Speaker 1>it's also the sort of book that will</v>
<v Speaker 1>rattle you up so neat.</v>

47
00:03:35.331 --> 00:03:38.520
<v Speaker 1>You is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is very interested in the problem of</v>

48
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.720
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem of value fundamentally</v>

49
00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:46.721
<v Speaker 1>is not the problem of what is the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>made out or even how does the world</v>

50
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.800
<v Speaker 1>function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are more in some sense more</v>

51
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.150
<v Speaker 1>specifically scientific questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how is it that you should conduct</v>

52
00:03:56.151 --> 00:03:58.760
<v Speaker 1>yourself in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How should you act?</v>

53
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.450
<v Speaker 1>And people act towards aims in a sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're active creatures and we're</v>

54
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:10.310
<v Speaker 1>moving from one point to another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're moving towards things that we</v>

55
00:04:10.311 --> 00:04:13.670
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means that we're guided by our</v>

56
00:04:13.671 --> 00:04:18.671
<v Speaker 1>desires and we're not only guided by</v>
<v Speaker 1>designers in so as we have individual</v>

57
00:04:18.801 --> 00:04:23.801
<v Speaker 1>desires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're guided by the structure that</v>

58
00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.920
<v Speaker 1>consists of how those desires are</v>
<v Speaker 1>related to one another.</v>

59
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.490
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a room full of people,</v>

60
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.400
<v Speaker 1>say a room full of children,</v>

61
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.810
<v Speaker 1>they're active and they're each pursuing</v>
<v Speaker 1>their individual desires.</v>

62
00:04:39.811 --> 00:04:44.790
<v Speaker 1>But at some point they may choose to</v>
<v Speaker 1>organize themselves into a game and if</v>

63
00:04:44.791 --> 00:04:48.900
<v Speaker 1>they organize themselves into a game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing for all intents and</v>

64
00:04:48.901 --> 00:04:52.650
<v Speaker 1>purposes is producing a little society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little micro society.</v>

65
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.880
<v Speaker 1>And within that micro society they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>deciding what desires will be currently</v>

66
00:04:57.901 --> 00:05:00.960
<v Speaker 1>expressed and how they'll exist in</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to one another.</v>

67
00:05:00.961 --> 00:05:05.961
<v Speaker 1>And that means that they can cooperate</v>
<v Speaker 1>without too much conflict and that they</v>

68
00:05:06.721 --> 00:05:10.480
<v Speaker 1>can jointly move towards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

69
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.650
<v Speaker 1>a joint ame without</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

70
00:05:15.951 --> 00:05:18.810
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and gather all the benefits that might</v>

71
00:05:18.811 --> 00:05:21.990
<v Speaker 1>be associated with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that might be the accomplishment of</v>

72
00:05:21.991 --> 00:05:22.980
<v Speaker 1>the Ame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

73
00:05:22.981 --> 00:05:26.700
<v Speaker 1>But it also might be just the enjoyment</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's to be had in the pursuit of that</v>

74
00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:29.790
<v Speaker 1>activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now people do that</v>

75
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.990
<v Speaker 1>socially because we have to do that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to get along with other people</v>

76
00:05:36.991 --> 00:05:40.050
<v Speaker 1>because our designers have to be melded</v>
<v Speaker 1>with those of other people.</v>

77
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:45.290
<v Speaker 1>But we also do in psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those two things exist in a dance</v>

78
00:05:45.331 --> 00:05:48.210
<v Speaker 1>because as I'm interacting with other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

79
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.770
<v Speaker 1>the demands of the fact that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>interacting make require each of us to</v>

80
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.770
<v Speaker 1>arrange our desires in a way that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptable to everyone else.</v>

81
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.040
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing that we're also</v>

82
00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:07.970
<v Speaker 1>observing the process by which those</v>
<v Speaker 1>desires are ordered.</v>

83
00:06:07.971 --> 00:06:11.840
<v Speaker 1>And then we internalize that process and</v>
<v Speaker 1>use that to order our own desires.</v>

84
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:17.140
<v Speaker 1>And then so there's a constant</v>
<v Speaker 1>mutually informative dance between the</v>

85
00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:20.840
<v Speaker 1>individual and the group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the culmination of that is the</v>

86
00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:24.470
<v Speaker 1>organization of society and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneous organization of the psyche.</v>

87
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:30.250
<v Speaker 1>And it's that process that needs you is</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about in these paragraphs.</v>

88
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Now you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

89
00:06:34.731 --> 00:06:38.810
<v Speaker 1>what's the utility of articulating such</v>
<v Speaker 1>things?</v>

90
00:06:38.811 --> 00:06:43.811
<v Speaker 1>And conceptualizing them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding them and the answer in</v>

91
00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:45.440
<v Speaker 1>some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's straight forward.</v>

92
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.620
<v Speaker 1>If you don't want to run a foul of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own desires,</v>

93
00:06:50.621 --> 00:06:55.060
<v Speaker 1>you have to organize them</v>
<v Speaker 1>because some of them are short term and</v>

94
00:06:55.061 --> 00:06:59.070
<v Speaker 1>some of them are medium term and some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them are long term and some of the main</v>

95
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.740
<v Speaker 1>this and some of the main that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't necessarily the case that</v>

96
00:07:02.741 --> 00:07:06.910
<v Speaker 1>those desires allow for mutual</v>
<v Speaker 1>fulfillment.</v>

97
00:07:06.911 --> 00:07:09.940
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're very interested in pursuing</v>

98
00:07:09.941 --> 00:07:13.750
<v Speaker 1>a sexual relationship with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're also very interested in</v>

99
00:07:13.751 --> 00:07:16.270
<v Speaker 1>having a family and some stability in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>

100
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.620
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you're interested in pursuing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual relationship with a whole</v>

101
00:07:20.621 --> 00:07:23.320
<v Speaker 1>sequence of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're also interested in having a</v>

102
00:07:23.321 --> 00:07:28.240
<v Speaker 1>family of stabilizing your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not obvious that those desires can</v>

103
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.370
<v Speaker 1>exist in the same universe without</v>
<v Speaker 1>producing what you might think about as</v>

104
00:07:33.371 --> 00:07:35.350
<v Speaker 1>a war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of that might be a</v>

105
00:07:35.351 --> 00:07:38.620
<v Speaker 1>psychological more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of it's also going to be a war</v>

106
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.180
<v Speaker 1>that actually occurs in existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

107
00:07:43.181 --> 00:07:46.480
<v Speaker 1>you're fighting through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>contradictory consequences of wanting to</v>

108
00:07:46.481 --> 00:07:50.200
<v Speaker 1>pursue many people and formulate a</v>
<v Speaker 1>stable relationship with one person.</v>

109
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.110
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason that you want to</v>

110
00:07:55.111 --> 00:07:59.280
<v Speaker 1>think about these sorts of things is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you think about them and get</v>

111
00:07:59.281 --> 00:08:04.281
<v Speaker 1>your thoughts and your value system</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligently and coherently cogently</v>

112
00:08:08.251 --> 00:08:12.750
<v Speaker 1>laid out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then when you act out that value system</v>

113
00:08:12.751 --> 00:08:15.510
<v Speaker 1>in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to run into less conflict</v>

114
00:08:15.511 --> 00:08:18.780
<v Speaker 1>and less uncertainty and less misery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to have a higher</v>

115
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.810
<v Speaker 1>probability of getting what it is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want.</v>

116
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.100
<v Speaker 1>But you're also going to have a higher</v>
<v Speaker 1>probability of getting what you want in</v>

117
00:08:26.101 --> 00:08:31.101
<v Speaker 1>a way that allows you to cooperate with</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people without entering into too</v>

118
00:08:31.291 --> 00:08:35.190
<v Speaker 1>much conflict with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in some sense,</v>

119
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.250
<v Speaker 1>the purpose that you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason that you think are the</v>

120
00:08:38.251 --> 00:08:43.251
<v Speaker 1>purpose of thinking is so that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort out how you're going to move</v>

121
00:08:44.131 --> 00:08:49.131
<v Speaker 1>forward in the world without having to</v>
<v Speaker 1>directly run headlong into all the</v>

122
00:08:50.641 --> 00:08:53.820
<v Speaker 1>obstacles that you might run into if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were doing such a thing blindly.</v>

123
00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.650
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

124
00:08:55.651 --> 00:09:00.651
<v Speaker 1>why would you bother reading philosophy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The philosophy written by someone who's</v>

125
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.040
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>

126
00:09:03.041 --> 00:09:08.041
<v Speaker 1>is that they can help you think these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things through in a manner that you</v>

127
00:09:08.851 --> 00:09:11.250
<v Speaker 1>would not be capable of doing on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>own.</v>

128
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Nisha,</v>

129
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult to estimate how</v>

130
00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:21.060
<v Speaker 1>intelligent needs you it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I suspect he was perhaps one in a</v>

131
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:24.060
<v Speaker 1>billion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would put him far beyond the</v>

132
00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:29.061
<v Speaker 1>99.999 percentile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a massive difference between</v>

133
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:35.540
<v Speaker 1>the ability of people to think as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>move farther and farther out into the</v>

134
00:09:36.511 --> 00:09:40.650
<v Speaker 1>extremes of intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you have the writings of</v>

135
00:09:40.651 --> 00:09:45.480
<v Speaker 1>someone who's one in a billion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can interact with those</v>

136
00:09:45.481 --> 00:09:49.590
<v Speaker 1>writings in a way that enables you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you'll put the time into</v>

137
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:56.330
<v Speaker 1>benefit from the spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact of that intelligence nature was</v>

138
00:09:56.461 --> 00:10:00.510
<v Speaker 1>a full professor by the time he was 24</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a time when he didn't even have to</v>

139
00:10:00.511 --> 00:10:04.080
<v Speaker 1>write this dissertation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just made him a full professor at a</v>

140
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:06.690
<v Speaker 1>time where that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that never happened.</v>

141
00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:17.140
<v Speaker 1>So this is what he has to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the prejudice is a philosopher.</v>

142
00:10:17.141 --> 00:10:19.090
<v Speaker 1>So just the first chapter of that,</v>

143
00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.550
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond good and evil,</v>

144
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:27.920
<v Speaker 1>it has gradually become clear to me what</v>
<v Speaker 1>every Greek philosophy up until now has</v>

145
00:10:28.351 --> 00:10:33.351
<v Speaker 1>consistent of namely the confession of</v>
<v Speaker 1>its originator and the species of</v>

146
00:10:34.381 --> 00:10:37.440
<v Speaker 1>involuntary and unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>autobiography.</v>

147
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:40.363
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

148
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.960
<v Speaker 1>that's deceptive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a deceptively simple sentence.</v>

149
00:10:44.961 --> 00:10:48.040
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's not a particularly</v>
<v Speaker 1>simple sentence because it,</v>

150
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:52.490
<v Speaker 1>it stands on a tab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What people generally assume about the</v>

151
00:10:52.491 --> 00:10:53.630
<v Speaker 1>process of thinking.</v>

152
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.850
<v Speaker 1>You generally think that when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

153
00:10:57.851 --> 00:11:00.010
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned before,</v>

154
00:11:00.011 --> 00:11:04.510
<v Speaker 1>the structure of the objective world</v>
<v Speaker 1>niches is making an entirely different</v>

155
00:11:04.511 --> 00:11:07.660
<v Speaker 1>point here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what he's fundamentally doing is</v>

156
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:11.410
<v Speaker 1>treating the philosopher not as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rational being,</v>

157
00:11:11.411 --> 00:11:15.010
<v Speaker 1>but as a living being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a big difference between</v>

158
00:11:15.011 --> 00:11:17.770
<v Speaker 1>being a rational being and being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>living being.</v>

159
00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're living being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your primary goal is to do whatever it</v>

160
00:11:21.131 --> 00:11:23.650
<v Speaker 1>is that furthers your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a rational being,</v>

161
00:11:23.651 --> 00:11:28.120
<v Speaker 1>then your primary goal is to do whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that a rational being Mike Duke,</v>

162
00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:32.950
<v Speaker 1>and you could say that the living being</v>
<v Speaker 1>should first and foremost be a rational</v>

163
00:11:32.951 --> 00:11:35.770
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in some sense that's the message of</v>

164
00:11:35.771 --> 00:11:37.930
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Western enlightenment.</v>

165
00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.500
<v Speaker 1>But it's by no means self evident that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the case.</v>

166
00:11:41.501 --> 00:11:43.330
<v Speaker 1>And it's certainly not something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche,</v>

167
00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.300
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche doesn't believe that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are rational beings as certainly not a</v>

168
00:11:47.301 --> 00:11:51.130
<v Speaker 1>primarily and more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he isn't exactly convinced that they</v>

169
00:11:51.131 --> 00:11:52.060
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

170
00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:57.090
<v Speaker 1>so for example of nature's most famous</v>
<v Speaker 1>maximums is that truth serves life and</v>

171
00:11:59.231 --> 00:12:03.520
<v Speaker 1>that's a very difficult different idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the purpose of truth say is the</v>

172
00:12:03.521 --> 00:12:05.770
<v Speaker 1>accurate representation of the objective</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

173
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.010
<v Speaker 1>Those aren't the same thing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you could ask,</v>

174
00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:10.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean for truth to serve</v>

175
00:12:10.721 --> 00:12:13.270
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you construed truth that way,</v>

176
00:12:13.271 --> 00:12:15.730
<v Speaker 1>what would truth look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

177
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:20.470
<v Speaker 1>the mere statement that truths should</v>
<v Speaker 1>serve life doesn't offer you the answers</v>

178
00:12:20.471 --> 00:12:22.180
<v Speaker 1>to those questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

179
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:27.750
<v Speaker 1>it's the beginning of a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphysics.</v>

180
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:32.400
<v Speaker 1>And in some sense of metaphysics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is say the universe within which a</v>

181
00:12:32.401 --> 00:12:37.401
<v Speaker 1>philosopher might operate a metaphysics</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the initial structure of</v>

182
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:43.290
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions within which a view of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is organized.</v>

183
00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:50.590
<v Speaker 1>One presupposition might be human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>are rational and that we're attempting</v>

184
00:12:50.591 --> 00:12:55.591
<v Speaker 1>to formulate and improve our sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the objective world,</v>

185
00:12:55.751 --> 00:12:57.340
<v Speaker 1>our formulation with the objective</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

186
00:12:57.341 --> 00:13:01.480
<v Speaker 1>And another would be that you would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>so aren't rational or irrational,</v>

187
00:13:01.481 --> 00:13:04.030
<v Speaker 1>and that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're motivated to do is to live</v>

188
00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:07.900
<v Speaker 1>whatever that means and that the purpose</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our thinking and our philosophy</v>

189
00:13:07.901 --> 00:13:11.800
<v Speaker 1>should be to facilitate our living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's Nietzsche's,</v>

190
00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:16.860
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the foundation</v>
<v Speaker 1>blocks of niches,</v>

191
00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.890
<v Speaker 1>philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's a moral philosopher,</v>

192
00:13:20.891 --> 00:13:23.680
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because morality is about values and the</v>

193
00:13:23.681 --> 00:13:26.650
<v Speaker 1>values essentially values are,</v>

194
00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.180
<v Speaker 1>you could say values are what you aim</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

195
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:34.270
<v Speaker 1>but it's more complicated than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Values actually constitute the lens</v>

196
00:13:34.271 --> 00:13:37.690
<v Speaker 1>through which you view the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's partly what you're aiming APP,</v>

197
00:13:37.691 --> 00:13:41.500
<v Speaker 1>but it's also partly your conception of</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you are now and where you are.</v>

198
00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:46.420
<v Speaker 1>And it's also partly your conception of</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you're going to get to where it is</v>

199
00:13:46.421 --> 00:13:51.421
<v Speaker 1>that you want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also partly the psychological</v>

200
00:13:52.151 --> 00:13:56.440
<v Speaker 1>system that you use to parse up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world so that it reveals to you the</v>

201
00:13:56.441 --> 00:13:58.860
<v Speaker 1>pathway that you can take to get to what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want.</v>

202
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.230
<v Speaker 1>Value is all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's more than that because you</v>

203
00:14:02.231 --> 00:14:06.240
<v Speaker 1>could say that you have added value</v>
<v Speaker 1>which contains all of that.</v>

204
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.440
<v Speaker 1>But then you can say that you have a set</v>
<v Speaker 1>of values,</v>

205
00:14:08.441 --> 00:14:11.710
<v Speaker 1>which is the arrangement of all about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can say that you have a set</v>

206
00:14:11.711 --> 00:14:14.080
<v Speaker 1>of values that's the range,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of all of that,</v>

207
00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.480
<v Speaker 1>that you have to arrange with other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

208
00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:20.550
<v Speaker 1>And then you could say that you have all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and you have to arrange it without</v>

209
00:14:20.551 --> 00:14:23.830
<v Speaker 1>a people and you have to arrange it</v>
<v Speaker 1>across different spans of time.</v>

210
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Because what you want today and what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want next week and what you want next</v>

211
00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.380
<v Speaker 1>month are not necessarily at the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

212
00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:31.990
<v Speaker 1>And one does not necessarily lead into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other.</v>

213
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:36.280
<v Speaker 1>So to be a moral philosopher is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>examine how that,</v>

214
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.240
<v Speaker 1>what that system is and how it operates</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how it came about.</v>

215
00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.850
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that nature says is it</v>

216
00:14:42.851 --> 00:14:46.120
<v Speaker 1>has gradually become clear to me what</v>
<v Speaker 1>every Greek philosophy up until now as</v>

217
00:14:46.121 --> 00:14:50.410
<v Speaker 1>consistent up namely the confession of</v>
<v Speaker 1>its originator and a species of</v>

218
00:14:50.411 --> 00:14:52.730
<v Speaker 1>involuntary and unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>autobiography.</v>

219
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:57.470
<v Speaker 1>So his claim fundamentally is that no</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter what the philosopher thinks he's</v>

220
00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.510
<v Speaker 1>doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's reading philosophy.</v>

221
00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:04.660
<v Speaker 1>What he's actually doing is revealing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and articulating his Ba.</v>

222
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.060
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

223
00:15:08.061 --> 00:15:11.690
<v Speaker 1>where did that be income from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>

224
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.100
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly it's,</v>

225
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:16.070
<v Speaker 1>you could consider it a biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>function in so far,</v>

226
00:15:16.071 --> 00:15:20.150
<v Speaker 1>is that we have value structures that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are built into us that are the process.</v>

227
00:15:20.151 --> 00:15:23.150
<v Speaker 1>We would say the process of a very long</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary history.</v>

228
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:28.570
<v Speaker 1>But because you're also a cultural</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon and because the manner in</v>

229
00:15:28.581 --> 00:15:33.080
<v Speaker 1>which you've arranged your values and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your desires has been conditioned to the</v>

230
00:15:33.081 --> 00:15:38.081
<v Speaker 1>last degree by the process of</v>
<v Speaker 1>enculturation that you were subjected to</v>

231
00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.553
<v Speaker 1>when you</v>

232
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:46.630
<v Speaker 1>can fast and an autobiographical manner</v>
<v Speaker 1>and articulate that what you're also</v>

233
00:15:46.631 --> 00:15:51.631
<v Speaker 1>doing is re capitulating the entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of your culture.</v>

234
00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:53.230
<v Speaker 1>It's in you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

235
00:15:53.231 --> 00:15:56.800
<v Speaker 1>well where is it in you and that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it do you mean part of it</v>

236
00:15:56.801 --> 00:16:01.801
<v Speaker 1>means is that you act out in a pattern</v>
<v Speaker 1>of behavior and that pattern of behavior</v>

237
00:16:02.141 --> 00:16:06.880
<v Speaker 1>is like a dance that someone is</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifesting to a symphonic score.</v>

238
00:16:06.881 --> 00:16:11.881
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievably complicated and it has</v>
<v Speaker 1>its psychological elements.</v>

239
00:16:11.951 --> 00:16:14.050
<v Speaker 1>And some of those are conscious and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them aren't.</v>

240
00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.140
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are just implicit in</v>
<v Speaker 1>embedded in the way you act and the way</v>

241
00:16:17.141 --> 00:16:19.090
<v Speaker 1>you perceive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what the philosopher is attempting</v>

242
00:16:19.091 --> 00:16:24.091
<v Speaker 1>to do is to reveal those to himself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to articulate them so that the entire</v>

243
00:16:24.911 --> 00:16:27.250
<v Speaker 1>structure can be analyzed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

244
00:16:27.251 --> 00:16:32.251
<v Speaker 1>So nature's first proposition is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>when a philosopher is thinking that what</v>

245
00:16:32.621 --> 00:16:36.070
<v Speaker 1>he's doing is not thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's revealing himself and an</v>

246
00:16:36.071 --> 00:16:39.340
<v Speaker 1>autobiographical sense under the guise</v>
<v Speaker 1>of rational thinking,</v>

247
00:16:39.341 --> 00:16:41.590
<v Speaker 1>and so then it becomes something more</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a story.</v>

248
00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:43.373
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

249
00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:47.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any governors all about in the first two</v>

250
00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:50.750
<v Speaker 1>phrases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that gives you some example,</v>

251
00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.180
<v Speaker 1>some indication of what this book is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like</v>

252
00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.920
<v Speaker 1>the species of involuntary and</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious autobiography.</v>

253
00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a more complicated idea too</v>

254
00:17:04.261 --> 00:17:05.250
<v Speaker 1>because you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

255
00:17:05.251 --> 00:17:09.930
<v Speaker 1>why would someone be driven in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>involuntary way and an unconscious way</v>

256
00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:13.440
<v Speaker 1>to describe their autobiography?</v>

257
00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:15.183
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

258
00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.250
<v Speaker 1>that's a very complicated question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be that one of the reasons that</v>

259
00:17:19.251 --> 00:17:22.070
<v Speaker 1>people value one another is because we</v>

260
00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:28.510
<v Speaker 1>engage in the process of sharing deeply</v>
<v Speaker 1>autobiographical information.</v>

261
00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:32.620
<v Speaker 1>You tell me your story and I tell you my</v>
<v Speaker 1>story and you might say,</v>

262
00:17:32.621 --> 00:17:32.961
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

263
00:17:32.961 --> 00:17:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Why do we even bother with such things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that as well.</v>

264
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:40.300
<v Speaker 1>If you can tell me about the pain and</v>
<v Speaker 1>tragedy that you've encountered,</v>

265
00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:45.160
<v Speaker 1>then that gives me a better way of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gives me a better vision of the</v>

266
00:17:45.161 --> 00:17:49.030
<v Speaker 1>dangers of the world without actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>having to expose myself to those</v>

267
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:50.730
<v Speaker 1>dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except in simulation.</v>

268
00:17:50.731 --> 00:17:53.430
<v Speaker 1>I might feel sorry for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might feel bad about your tragic</v>

269
00:17:53.431 --> 00:17:56.040
<v Speaker 1>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not bleeding for them.</v>

270
00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.700
<v Speaker 1>And then there's always the possibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you'll also tell me how you solved</v>

271
00:17:59.701 --> 00:18:02.760
<v Speaker 1>your problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which case I can either avoid that</v>

272
00:18:02.761 --> 00:18:06.120
<v Speaker 1>problem entirely or if I do encounter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can solve it without having to go</v>

273
00:18:06.121 --> 00:18:08.520
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it took you decades to formulate</v>

274
00:18:08.521 --> 00:18:12.450
<v Speaker 1>your solution to that problem and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can tell me your story and then I have</v>

275
00:18:12.451 --> 00:18:16.110
<v Speaker 1>the information and so that's part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what human beings are always trading.</v>

276
00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:19.740
<v Speaker 1>That's why we talked to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we can communicate and so</v>

277
00:18:19.741 --> 00:18:20.401
<v Speaker 1>neat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would say,</v>

278
00:18:20.401 --> 00:18:20.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

279
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.740
<v Speaker 1>it's involuntary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious,</v>

280
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:27.570
<v Speaker 1>involuntary unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's alluding to the fact that that</v>

281
00:18:27.571 --> 00:18:31.410
<v Speaker 1>proclivity is so deeply embedded in</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that desire to,</v>

282
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.040
<v Speaker 1>to make an autobiographical recounting</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

283
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:38.103
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

284
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:42.810
<v Speaker 1>it serves as the kind of motivation that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't question for doing almost</v>

285
00:18:42.811 --> 00:18:45.060
<v Speaker 1>everything that we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

286
00:18:45.061 --> 00:18:48.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean people do such things as a 10</v>

287
00:18:48.451 --> 00:18:51.000
<v Speaker 1>movies in place and they usually do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happily,</v>

288
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:54.360
<v Speaker 1>especially if the movie or the play is</v>
<v Speaker 1>of high quality.</v>

289
00:18:54.361 --> 00:18:56.940
<v Speaker 1>And the same thing happens when people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are reading novels.</v>

290
00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:03.500
<v Speaker 1>They're attracted to such things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a built in value and it's very</v>

291
00:19:03.501 --> 00:19:06.290
<v Speaker 1>rarely the case that people will ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>question why it is that they're doing</v>

292
00:19:06.291 --> 00:19:07.460
<v Speaker 1>such things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

293
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:10.670
<v Speaker 1>you see this quite commonly with</v>
<v Speaker 1>students who were first introduced to</v>

294
00:19:10.671 --> 00:19:12.750
<v Speaker 1>the study of literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

295
00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:18.180
<v Speaker 1>the introduction of the idea that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should analyze what it is that you're</v>

296
00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:24.910
<v Speaker 1>engaged in when you're reading actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes as unwelcome news to most people</v>

297
00:19:25.761 --> 00:19:29.450
<v Speaker 1>who are inclined towards fiction because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to interfere with the</v>

298
00:19:29.451 --> 00:19:31.280
<v Speaker 1>process of engagement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

299
00:19:31.281 --> 00:19:36.050
<v Speaker 1>automatic unconscious engagement with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the material by detaching themselves and</v>

300
00:19:36.051 --> 00:19:37.910
<v Speaker 1>having to think about what they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

301
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:41.600
<v Speaker 1>So that's why it's an involuntary and</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>

302
00:19:41.601 --> 00:19:42.290
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

303
00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:44.690
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the things within which</v>

304
00:19:44.691 --> 00:19:48.980
<v Speaker 1>thought operates rather than what are</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things on which thought operates.</v>

305
00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:56.080
<v Speaker 1>Then he says the moral or immoral</v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose in which every philosophy has</v>

306
00:19:56.081 --> 00:19:58.120
<v Speaker 1>constituted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

307
00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:03.330
<v Speaker 1>the moral or immoral purpose in every</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy has constituted the true</v>

308
00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:08.020
<v Speaker 1>vital germ out of which the entire plant</v>
<v Speaker 1>has always grown.</v>

309
00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a hell of a thing to say too,</v>

310
00:20:10.571 --> 00:20:14.230
<v Speaker 1>because what Nietzsche is alluding to</v>
<v Speaker 1>there in some senses that</v>

311
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:20.583
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

312
00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:25.770
<v Speaker 1>the philosopher Kant help and that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be in some sense also the person who was</v>

313
00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:30.310
<v Speaker 1>recounting their autobiography can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>help but tell you what they're up to,</v>

314
00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:35.140
<v Speaker 1>even though they might not know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is something that you own</v>

315
00:20:35.141 --> 00:20:37.340
<v Speaker 1>because you almost have Carl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll know the site.</v>

316
00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:39.490
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysts was a great student of</v>

317
00:20:39.491 --> 00:20:44.491
<v Speaker 1>nature and you came to believe that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>all inhabit and stories,</v>

318
00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:47.890
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his stories.</v>

319
00:20:47.891 --> 00:20:50.890
<v Speaker 1>We didn't happen to who were actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>the structures of value within which we</v>

320
00:20:50.891 --> 00:20:54.220
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that those stories essentially had</v>

321
00:20:54.221 --> 00:20:58.570
<v Speaker 1>an ethic or a moral and then you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can start thinking about what the</v>

322
00:20:58.571 --> 00:21:01.810
<v Speaker 1>ethics and the morals might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you kind of have some sense of that</v>

323
00:21:01.811 --> 00:21:04.150
<v Speaker 1>because there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's comedic stories and tragic</v>

324
00:21:04.151 --> 00:21:07.360
<v Speaker 1>stories and there's evil characters in</v>
<v Speaker 1>good characters and so forth.</v>

325
00:21:07.361 --> 00:21:10.660
<v Speaker 1>Those are architectural characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But part of the point that Nietzsche is</v>

326
00:21:10.661 --> 00:21:13.660
<v Speaker 1>attempting to make here is that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher is in fact aiming it</v>

327
00:21:13.661 --> 00:21:17.260
<v Speaker 1>something with his life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all of his actions.</v>

328
00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.890
<v Speaker 1>He might not even know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but partly what he's doing in his</v>

329
00:21:20.891 --> 00:21:25.510
<v Speaker 1>attempt to philosophize is to articulate</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in reveal it to himself and to</v>

330
00:21:25.511 --> 00:21:26.344
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

331
00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.250
<v Speaker 1>So then the question becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

332
00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.730
<v Speaker 1>what is it that the person is up to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say in some sense that's the</v>

333
00:21:35.731 --> 00:21:37.070
<v Speaker 1>ultimate question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So neat.</v>

334
00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:40.110
<v Speaker 1>You here in this paragraph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is also dealing with the,</v>

335
00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:44.940
<v Speaker 1>with the ultimate question in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which might be well to what is your</v>

336
00:21:44.941 --> 00:21:46.260
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

337
00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:47.551
<v Speaker 1>and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

338
00:21:47.551 --> 00:21:49.050
<v Speaker 1>it's not aimed at anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's it.</v>

339
00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:51.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't seem to have any coherent set of</v>

340
00:21:51.841 --> 00:21:53.040
<v Speaker 1>beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I believe.</v>

341
00:21:53.041 --> 00:21:57.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in anything either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's not the case because if you</v>

342
00:21:57.361 --> 00:21:59.460
<v Speaker 1>didn't believe in anything you couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

343
00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:03.750
<v Speaker 1>you have to believe in something to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to see because you point your eyes</v>

344
00:22:03.751 --> 00:22:07.050
<v Speaker 1>and things and you can't organize your</v>
<v Speaker 1>vision without having a name.</v>

345
00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:11.250
<v Speaker 1>And so the very act of interacting with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world presupposes an ethic.</v>

346
00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:16.020
<v Speaker 1>And then all those micro ethics that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>contain within,</v>

347
00:22:16.021 --> 00:22:18.660
<v Speaker 1>you are organized into some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

348
00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.550
<v Speaker 1>either badly or well.</v>

349
00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:25.040
<v Speaker 1>And that structure roughly has an aim</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might know it and you might not,</v>

350
00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:26.810
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean it isn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

351
00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:30.390
<v Speaker 1>so what other thing that needs he is</v>
<v Speaker 1>alluding to is that you believe things</v>

352
00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:32.650
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you think you believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

353
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:36.570
<v Speaker 1>In fact believing them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unknowing you believe them aren't even</v>

354
00:22:36.571 --> 00:22:39.630
<v Speaker 1>the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the people believe all sorts of</v>

355
00:22:39.631 --> 00:22:43.410
<v Speaker 1>things that they don't know about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that partly what they're doing when</v>

356
00:22:43.411 --> 00:22:46.020
<v Speaker 1>they're doing philosophy is to try and</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what those things are.</v>

357
00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:46.531
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

358
00:22:46.531 --> 00:22:48.810
<v Speaker 1>when you can also ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well where did they come from?</v>

359
00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:50.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think partly came from you,</v>

360
00:22:50.971 --> 00:22:53.520
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an old thing.</v>

361
00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Your physical form is three and a half</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion years old and you're the process</v>

362
00:22:58.831 --> 00:23:02.400
<v Speaker 1>of all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of the death and struggling that</v>

363
00:23:02.401 --> 00:23:07.401
<v Speaker 1>went along the entire course of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>three and a half billion years is you</v>

364
00:23:07.621 --> 00:23:08.850
<v Speaker 1>carry that with you.</v>

365
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:14.270
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that inside you is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the consequence of the entire cultural</v>

366
00:23:15.091 --> 00:23:18.420
<v Speaker 1>history of complex life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all inside youtube.</v>

367
00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.780
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of that's articulated more or less,</v>

368
00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:25.650
<v Speaker 1>some of act without dramatized</v>
<v Speaker 1>represented and fiction and that sort of</v>

369
00:23:25.651 --> 00:23:27.630
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then some of it's articulated,</v>

370
00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:33.110
<v Speaker 1>but there's way more at the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it is fully articulate and so god</v>

371
00:23:33.481 --> 00:23:36.240
<v Speaker 1>only knows what you're up to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

372
00:23:36.241 --> 00:23:37.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who cares?</v>

373
00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with that is that you care</v>

374
00:23:39.481 --> 00:23:41.640
<v Speaker 1>because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the definition of caring.</v>

375
00:23:41.641 --> 00:23:45.430
<v Speaker 1>And second of all that determines that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

376
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:50.090
<v Speaker 1>the way that you will move through your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life and everything that happens to you.</v>

377
00:23:50.091 --> 00:23:53.720
<v Speaker 1>That's good or evil or good or bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be a consequence of the</v>

378
00:23:53.721 --> 00:23:55.910
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of that ethic in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

379
00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:01.610
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now nature is saying something else</v>

380
00:24:01.611 --> 00:24:04.790
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he says the moral or immoral</v>

381
00:24:04.791 --> 00:24:08.690
<v Speaker 1>purpose in whichever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the moral or immoral purpose in every</v>

382
00:24:08.691 --> 00:24:13.250
<v Speaker 1>philosophy has constituted the true</v>
<v Speaker 1>vital germ out of which the entire plant</v>

383
00:24:13.251 --> 00:24:17.720
<v Speaker 1>is always grown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's saying that the philosopher can't</v>

384
00:24:17.721 --> 00:24:22.250
<v Speaker 1>help but reveal his aim in his writings</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he's saying something else,</v>

385
00:24:22.251 --> 00:24:26.760
<v Speaker 1>which is that even might be malevolent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

386
00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:31.400
<v Speaker 1>modern people aren't very comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 1>with ideas like malevolence because</v>

387
00:24:31.401 --> 00:24:36.401
<v Speaker 1>malevolence is an idea that's related to</v>
<v Speaker 1>evil and modern people think of</v>

388
00:24:36.951 --> 00:24:39.380
<v Speaker 1>themselves as beyond good and evil to</v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree.</v>

389
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:42.740
<v Speaker 1>They don't believe in the reality of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those concepts.</v>

390
00:24:42.741 --> 00:24:46.190
<v Speaker 1>And of course in this book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beaches also questioning our,</v>

391
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:50.120
<v Speaker 1>at least our a priori presuppositions</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what do they need the lar.</v>

392
00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:53.870
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean that he doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that they don't exist.</v>

393
00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.980
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean that he doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that they don't exist.</v>

394
00:24:57.981 --> 00:24:58.940
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's,</v>

395
00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:03.840
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

396
00:25:03.841 --> 00:25:06.660
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the things I've thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>about when I was thinking about when</v>

397
00:25:06.661 --> 00:25:09.180
<v Speaker 1>I've thought about how Hitler died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

398
00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Hitler died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler committed suicide in a bunker</v>

399
00:25:13.861 --> 00:25:16.160
<v Speaker 1>underneath Berlin when Europe was</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflamed.</v>

400
00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:18.820
<v Speaker 2>And so one</v>

401
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:25.630
<v Speaker 1>conclusion that a psychoanalytically</v>
<v Speaker 1>minded historian could derive from that</v>

402
00:25:25.821 --> 00:25:29.900
<v Speaker 1>is that's what he wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

403
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:35.230
<v Speaker 1>And then that opens up an entire binder</v>
<v Speaker 1>of vast nest of snakes because one of</v>

404
00:25:36.291 --> 00:25:37.900
<v Speaker 1>the things that you might ask is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

405
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:40.190
<v Speaker 1>how is it that someone would desire</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

406
00:25:40.191 --> 00:25:41.960
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could that even be desired?</v>

407
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:44.210
<v Speaker 1>Is that actually something that anyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>could even desire?</v>

408
00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:46.940
<v Speaker 1>Then you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

409
00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.420
<v Speaker 1>why is it that someone would design</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

410
00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:54.680
<v Speaker 1>And then the next thing you might ask is</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a human being could desire that and</v>

411
00:25:54.681 --> 00:25:57.890
<v Speaker 1>hit there was a human being then exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that say about you?</v>

412
00:25:58.790 --> 00:25:59.541
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

413
00:25:59.541 --> 00:26:03.140
<v Speaker 1>I could never desire is such a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But following along that train of the</v>

414
00:26:03.141 --> 00:26:05.930
<v Speaker 1>argument that we've been laying out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like what makes you think you're a</v>

415
00:26:05.931 --> 00:26:07.910
<v Speaker 1>reliable judge of what it is that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to.</v>

416
00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.820
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

417
00:26:10.821 --> 00:26:15.821
<v Speaker 1>so now we've unpack three sentences and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll continue on with the same</v>

418
00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:22.030
<v Speaker 1>paragraph.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed to understand how the most</v>

419
00:26:22.131 --> 00:26:26.570
<v Speaker 1>abstract metaphysical assertions of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher have been arrived out.</v>

420
00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:32.760
<v Speaker 1>It is always well and why is to first</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask oneself what morality do they or</v>

421
00:26:33.861 --> 00:26:37.730
<v Speaker 1>does he a mat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what the question is,</v>

422
00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:39.020
<v Speaker 1>what's the first enough to,</v>

423
00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:41.423
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

424
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.290
<v Speaker 1>there's an entire nest of snakes</v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath that sentence,</v>

425
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:51.350
<v Speaker 1>that sequence of propositions as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of them is,</v>

426
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean that people are up to</v>

427
00:27:05.041 --> 00:27:07.430
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean that they're aiming at</v>

428
00:27:07.431 --> 00:27:12.431
<v Speaker 1>something</v>
<v Speaker 1>accordingly?</v>

429
00:27:13.661 --> 00:27:17.440
<v Speaker 1>I do not believe that an impulse to</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledgist the farther of philosophy</v>

430
00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:20.950
<v Speaker 1>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another impulse here as elsewhere has</v>

431
00:27:20.951 --> 00:27:25.630
<v Speaker 1>only made use of knowledge and mistaken</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge as an instrument.</v>

432
00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever considers the fundamental</v>

433
00:27:28.931 --> 00:27:32.230
<v Speaker 1>impulses of man with a view to</v>
<v Speaker 1>determining how far they leave here</v>

434
00:27:32.231 --> 00:27:33.640
<v Speaker 1>after this inspiring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

435
00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:38.650
<v Speaker 1>this is why this is going to require it</v>
<v Speaker 1>editing it so complicated to go through</v>

436
00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:46.690
<v Speaker 1>accordingly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not believe that an impulse to</v>

437
00:27:46.691 --> 00:27:48.340
<v Speaker 1>knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the farther up philosophy,</v>

438
00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:53.470
<v Speaker 1>but then another impulse here is</v>
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere has only made use of knowledge</v>

439
00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:56.500
<v Speaker 1>and mistaken knowledge as an instrument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

440
00:27:56.501 --> 00:28:00.550
<v Speaker 1>so let's take that apart accordingly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not believe that an impulse to</v>

441
00:28:00.551 --> 00:28:05.200
<v Speaker 1>knowledge is the farther off philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the claims,</v>

442
00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:07.560
<v Speaker 1>I suppose this would be an enlightened</v>
<v Speaker 1>human claim,</v>

443
00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:13.150
<v Speaker 1>is that people do have to drive to</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge and that that drive is in fact</v>

444
00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:16.840
<v Speaker 1>what underlies the production of such</v>
<v Speaker 1>things as philosophy,</v>

445
00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:22.420
<v Speaker 1>but need to questions that because he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to bring us back to consideration</v>

446
00:28:22.421 --> 00:28:27.421
<v Speaker 1>of the fact that you can't separate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophers mind from the philosophers</v>

447
00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:32.070
<v Speaker 1>being he's first and foremost the living</v>
<v Speaker 1>creature and the,</v>

448
00:28:32.071 --> 00:28:34.450
<v Speaker 1>he's up to something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the question is,</v>

449
00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:39.520
<v Speaker 1>what is it that he's up to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can see the earliest</v>

450
00:28:39.521 --> 00:28:43.960
<v Speaker 1>manifestations in a paragraph like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what later developed into</v>

451
00:28:43.961 --> 00:28:48.961
<v Speaker 1>deconstructionists thought and that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was mostly French continental</v>

452
00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:53.230
<v Speaker 1>philosophers who pursued that particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>line of reasoning.</v>

453
00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:58.450
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is derived exactly from this kind of</v>

454
00:28:58.451 --> 00:29:01.990
<v Speaker 1>statement by nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

455
00:29:01.991 --> 00:29:03.580
<v Speaker 1>someone like Garrett,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say</v>

456
00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.870
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter what the content of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the text is.</v>

457
00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.560
<v Speaker 1>What matters is that the text can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>used as a tool for power.</v>

458
00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.710
<v Speaker 1>And then whether the person who wrote</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tax knew it or not,</v>

459
00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:17.890
<v Speaker 1>that's what they were doing and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were doing it in a way to privilege</v>

460
00:29:17.891 --> 00:29:21.100
<v Speaker 1>themselves above other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really,</v>

461
00:29:21.101 --> 00:29:23.470
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental deconstructionist plain</v>

462
00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:26.890
<v Speaker 1>and it's a powerful claim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an utterly corrupt claim,</v>

463
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:30.610
<v Speaker 1>but it's a really powerful claim and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's related directly to the sorts of</v>

464
00:29:30.611 --> 00:29:34.660
<v Speaker 1>things that need you was referring to in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this paragraph.</v>

465
00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:36.730
<v Speaker 1>What is it that the person is truly up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to?</v>

466
00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>deconstructionist claim is that it's an,</v>

467
00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:43.630
<v Speaker 1>it's an open invitation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cynicism to thoughtless citizens.</v>

468
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:47.950
<v Speaker 1>I can just make the presupposition that</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is that you're telling me,</v>

469
00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:51.340
<v Speaker 1>you're you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're telling me merely to dominate</v>

470
00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:54.370
<v Speaker 1>regardless of what it is that you claim</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be doing.</v>

471
00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with that approach is that</v>

472
00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:05.400
<v Speaker 1>it's predicated on the implicit</v>
<v Speaker 1>assumption that the only value that</v>

473
00:30:05.401 --> 00:30:08.970
<v Speaker 1>people actually have is the value is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>desire to dominate.</v>

474
00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:12.510
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's a purely like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be the case.</v>

475
00:30:12.511 --> 00:30:17.160
<v Speaker 1>And I also think that it's even</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable to posit that to some degree</v>

476
00:30:17.161 --> 00:30:20.490
<v Speaker 1>that it is the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to take that from a contributing</v>

477
00:30:20.491 --> 00:30:24.630
<v Speaker 1>factor and to make that the highest God</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's essentially what the</v>

478
00:30:24.631 --> 00:30:28.650
<v Speaker 1>deconstructionists are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are entirely different things and</v>

479
00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:30.600
<v Speaker 1>you have to be aware of people who</v>

480
00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:37.660
<v Speaker 1>take a single causal element and</v>
<v Speaker 1>elevated to the stature of single</v>

481
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:41.120
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive cause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

482
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:45.800
<v Speaker 1>it's more reasonable to assume that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are complex in their motivation.</v>

483
00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:50.810
<v Speaker 1>So many different strands of biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cultural motivation are in some</v>

484
00:30:51.141 --> 00:30:53.840
<v Speaker 1>sense primary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens is that they come</v>

485
00:30:53.841 --> 00:30:57.620
<v Speaker 1>together to weave the kind of tapestry</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than to make the automatic</v>

486
00:30:57.621 --> 00:31:01.550
<v Speaker 1>assumption that you can reduce the</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire set of human motivations to a</v>

487
00:31:01.551 --> 00:31:04.070
<v Speaker 1>single principle like that power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>

488
00:31:04.071 --> 00:31:08.210
<v Speaker 1>I would say niche is also responsible to</v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree for the deconstructionist</v>

489
00:31:08.211 --> 00:31:11.540
<v Speaker 1>claim that it's power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because one of his most famous</v>

490
00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:16.720
<v Speaker 1>utterances was that the fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivating force in life is the will to</v>

491
00:31:16.971 --> 00:31:21.470
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he wasn't so much because nature is</v>

492
00:31:21.471 --> 00:31:24.860
<v Speaker 1>a subtle thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't so much attempting to reduce</v>

493
00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:29.780
<v Speaker 1>human motivation to power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was attempting to redefine what it</v>

494
00:31:29.781 --> 00:31:33.770
<v Speaker 1>was that we conceptualize downs power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas that isn't what the</v>

495
00:31:33.771 --> 00:31:37.190
<v Speaker 1>deconstructionists circling and all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because fundamentally they're Marxists</v>

496
00:31:37.191 --> 00:31:40.910
<v Speaker 1>and they believe that you know who they</v>
<v Speaker 1>is ensconced themselves within an</v>

497
00:31:40.911 --> 00:31:45.911
<v Speaker 1>economic viewpoint where within a</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical viewpoint where economics</v>

498
00:31:46.641 --> 00:31:51.641
<v Speaker 1>is paramount and where all that matters</v>
<v Speaker 1>is power construed as socioeconomic</v>

499
00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:56.620
<v Speaker 1>domination fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

500
00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.840
<v Speaker 1>and that's in turn is embedded in</v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphysics.</v>

501
00:31:59.841 --> 00:32:02.690
<v Speaker 1>That's even deeper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a metaphysics that presume that</v>

502
00:32:02.691 --> 00:32:06.770
<v Speaker 1>people are fundamentally materialists</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of those things are quick in a</v>

503
00:32:06.771 --> 00:32:08.600
<v Speaker 1>lot of those things are highly</v>
<v Speaker 1>questionable.</v>

504
00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:25.250
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to skip ahead a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the paragraph.</v>

505
00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:30.380
<v Speaker 1>When Nietzsche talks about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the motivations of,</v>

506
00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:36.130
<v Speaker 1>you would consider them</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who were working in the middle</v>

507
00:32:36.131 --> 00:32:39.710
<v Speaker 1>ranks of bureaucracies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they're scientific or otherwise.</v>

508
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:43.550
<v Speaker 1>So they're in some sense acting as cogs</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a particular machine.</v>

509
00:32:43.551 --> 00:32:45.830
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what he's describing here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says</v>

510
00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:54.620
<v Speaker 1>in the case of scholars or in the case</v>
<v Speaker 1>of really scientific men,</v>

511
00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:00.650
<v Speaker 1>it may be there may really be such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing as an impulse to knowledge,</v>

512
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:06.190
<v Speaker 1>some kind of small independent clockwork</v>
<v Speaker 1>which when well wellmed out works away</v>

513
00:33:06.621 --> 00:33:11.621
<v Speaker 1>industriously to that end without the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of the scholarly impulses taking</v>

514
00:33:11.751 --> 00:33:16.751
<v Speaker 1>any material park there in the actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>interests of the scholar therefore are</v>

515
00:33:17.061 --> 00:33:22.061
<v Speaker 1>generally in quite another direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is the family or in moneymaking more</v>

516
00:33:22.101 --> 00:33:25.160
<v Speaker 1>in politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is in fact almost indifferent at what</v>

517
00:33:25.161 --> 00:33:29.030
<v Speaker 1>point of research his little machine is</v>
<v Speaker 1>place and whether the hopefully young</v>

518
00:33:29.031 --> 00:33:32.780
<v Speaker 1>worker becomes a good fill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ologist someone who studied the origin</v>

519
00:33:32.781 --> 00:33:35.180
<v Speaker 1>of words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mushroom specialist or a chemist.</v>

520
00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:37.850
<v Speaker 1>He's not characterized becoming this by</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

521
00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:40.640
<v Speaker 1>He's not characterized by becoming this</v>
<v Speaker 1>or that</v>

522
00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:47.890
<v Speaker 1>niches point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are fundamentally is that even</v>

523
00:33:47.891 --> 00:33:52.891
<v Speaker 1>when you do analyze people who in whom</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the wheel to knowledge might</v>

524
00:33:54.941 --> 00:33:57.970
<v Speaker 1>actually be operative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though he wouldn't be willing to</v>

525
00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:02.980
<v Speaker 1>granted the status of highest motivating</v>
<v Speaker 1>power that even in those people where</v>

526
00:34:03.551 --> 00:34:07.300
<v Speaker 1>that Wilton all does exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that that is in turn</v>

527
00:34:07.301 --> 00:34:11.980
<v Speaker 1>subordinated to some other principle</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's higher than the value hierarchy</v>

528
00:34:11.981 --> 00:34:13.030
<v Speaker 1>is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very high.</v>

529
00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:16.870
<v Speaker 1>And it's hard to tell exactly what that</v>
<v Speaker 1>additional principle might be,</v>

530
00:34:16.871 --> 00:34:20.320
<v Speaker 1>but he points out such things as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're primarily interested in</v>

531
00:34:20.321 --> 00:34:24.310
<v Speaker 1>serving the interests of their family or</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're primarily interested in making</v>

532
00:34:24.311 --> 00:34:27.610
<v Speaker 1>money or maybe they're primarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in status and maybe they're</v>

533
00:34:27.611 --> 00:34:30.760
<v Speaker 1>interested in status status becomes it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it makes them more sexually</v>

534
00:34:30.761 --> 00:34:33.310
<v Speaker 1>attractive and that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

535
00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:34.173
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

536
00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:41.560
<v Speaker 1>the question of what is it that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>lurking in the background is always</v>

537
00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:43.970
<v Speaker 1>paramount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

538
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:47.303
<v Speaker 2>there</v>

539
00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:53.220
<v Speaker 1>detour in this particular paragraph,</v>

540
00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:58.293
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

541
00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:03.530
<v Speaker 1>whoever considers the fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 1>impulses of man with a view to</v>

542
00:35:03.531 --> 00:35:08.270
<v Speaker 1>determining how far they may have here</v>
<v Speaker 1>acted as inspiring Jenai</v>

543
00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:14.210
<v Speaker 1>or his demons will find that they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>all practice philosophy at one time or</v>

544
00:35:14.211 --> 00:35:16.730
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that each of them would have been</v>

545
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:21.740
<v Speaker 1>only too glad to look upon itself as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate end of existence and the</v>

546
00:35:21.741 --> 00:35:24.710
<v Speaker 1>legitimate lord over all of the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>impulses.</v>

547
00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:29.150
<v Speaker 1>That's another like the beyond good and</v>
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>

548
00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:32.210
<v Speaker 1>To think of it as a book is a really</v>
<v Speaker 1>foolish</v>

549
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.333
<v Speaker 2>framework.</v>

550
00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:41.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause this is what a book is.</v>

551
00:35:41.581 --> 00:35:43.340
<v Speaker 1>When people think about a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

552
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:45.210
<v Speaker 1>it's like a material entity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

553
00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:50.820
<v Speaker 1>it's eight inches high and six inches</v>
<v Speaker 1>wide and two inches thick and weighs a</v>

554
00:35:50.821 --> 00:35:53.040
<v Speaker 1>pound and it's made out of paper and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's between two,</v>

555
00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.530
<v Speaker 1>two covers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

556
00:35:55.531 --> 00:35:58.270
<v Speaker 1>And that's a materialist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the eight priority,</v>

557
00:35:58.271 --> 00:36:03.271
<v Speaker 1>sort of axiomatic view of book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nature's beyond good and evil isn't a</v>

558
00:36:04.321 --> 00:36:08.370
<v Speaker 1>book at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a series of bombs and each sentence</v>

559
00:36:08.371 --> 00:36:12.240
<v Speaker 1>is a ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And each sentence blows things up that</v>

560
00:36:12.241 --> 00:36:15.810
<v Speaker 1>people don't even know exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that with this</v>

561
00:36:15.811 --> 00:36:16.920
<v Speaker 1>sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

562
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:19.680
<v Speaker 1>here's how he's conceptualizing human</v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

563
00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:24.210
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing he talks about is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the FA,</v>

564
00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.680
<v Speaker 1>there are fundamental impulses that</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>

565
00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.080
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that begs a question.</v>

566
00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean by impulse and what do</v>

567
00:36:32.311 --> 00:36:33.480
<v Speaker 1>you mean by fundamental?</v>

568
00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:37.920
<v Speaker 1>And both of those are extraordinarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated problems.</v>

569
00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:41.310
<v Speaker 1>So an impulse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think of an impulse as it drive.</v>

570
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:44.160
<v Speaker 1>You could think about it as a biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>instinct.</v>

571
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.760
<v Speaker 1>They could think about it as a name or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>goal.</v>

572
00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:50.040
<v Speaker 1>You could think about it as an act of</v>
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>

573
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's endless questions that that,</v>

574
00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:57.930
<v Speaker 1>hang off that question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we could start with the idea that we</v>

575
00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:02.010
<v Speaker 1>perhaps can't define it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we are willing to go with the</v>

576
00:37:02.011 --> 00:37:04.110
<v Speaker 1>proposition that people do have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>impulses.</v>

577
00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:06.840
<v Speaker 1>And I think maybe that's manifest to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

578
00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Most particularly when you're attempting</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do something voluntarily and</v>

579
00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:15.900
<v Speaker 1>something in voluntarily interferes with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

580
00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:18.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe you're sitting down to to try</v>

581
00:37:18.961 --> 00:37:23.940
<v Speaker 1>to get some work done in the work is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>of any particular intrinsic interest but</v>

582
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.310
<v Speaker 1>you regarded as necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

583
00:37:26.311 --> 00:37:28.860
<v Speaker 1>necessary element in some higher order</v>
<v Speaker 1>scheme.</v>

584
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:32.700
<v Speaker 1>And so you're attempting to organize</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself so you will in fact concentrate</v>

585
00:37:32.701 --> 00:37:36.150
<v Speaker 1>on that particular relatively mundane</v>
<v Speaker 1>activity.</v>

586
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:40.080
<v Speaker 1>But what you find when you sit down to</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually engage in that is you can't do</v>

587
00:37:40.081 --> 00:37:43.110
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to go do the dishes or you have</v>

588
00:37:43.111 --> 00:37:46.830
<v Speaker 1>to clean under the bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you have to have a sexual fantasy or</v>

589
00:37:46.831 --> 00:37:49.050
<v Speaker 1>you or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or there's some other thing that you</v>

590
00:37:49.051 --> 00:37:51.510
<v Speaker 1>could do that's useful but that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't normally do,</v>

591
00:37:51.511 --> 00:37:55.350
<v Speaker 1>that you'll go do instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or that you fall asleep or that you get</v>

592
00:37:55.351 --> 00:37:57.840
<v Speaker 1>hungry or like there's an endless number</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

593
00:37:58.110 --> 00:38:02.730
<v Speaker 1>let's call them impulses that might</v>
<v Speaker 1>arise to interfere with your conscious</v>

594
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.530
<v Speaker 1>movement forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

595
00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:05.970
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are those things?</v>

596
00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:12.230
<v Speaker 1>While nature certainly conceptualizes</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human being as a place where those</v>

597
00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:16.980
<v Speaker 1>things live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he does mean live too because it</v>

598
00:38:16.981 --> 00:38:21.981
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't refer it to the misdeed demons</v>
<v Speaker 1>are or Jeanie's without introducing the</v>

599
00:38:23.371 --> 00:38:25.680
<v Speaker 1>metaphor conception of something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

600
00:38:25.681 --> 00:38:29.460
<v Speaker 1>And so partly what needs to reveals in</v>
<v Speaker 1>no sentences is that he conceptualized</v>

601
00:38:29.461 --> 00:38:34.260
<v Speaker 1>as a human being as the dwelling place</v>
<v Speaker 1>of spirits.</v>

602
00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:36.000
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

603
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.420
<v Speaker 1>some of them are Gv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say that's the root word of</v>

604
00:38:39.421 --> 00:38:42.240
<v Speaker 1>genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the terribly powerful thing that</v>

605
00:38:42.241 --> 00:38:44.790
<v Speaker 1>exists in the terribly small</v>
<v Speaker 1>compartment,</v>

606
00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:46.380
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have to call forth.</v>

607
00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:50.130
<v Speaker 1>And some of them are demons and demons</v>
<v Speaker 1>are things that have their own</v>

608
00:38:50.131 --> 00:38:53.370
<v Speaker 1>autonomous will and the generally aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>aiming for the good.</v>

609
00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.670
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so those are all things need.</v>

610
00:38:56.671 --> 00:38:59.580
<v Speaker 1>She just lays out as implicit parts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sentence.</v>

611
00:38:59.581 --> 00:39:02.880
<v Speaker 1>So we activates all those ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you know it or not,</v>

612
00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:05.310
<v Speaker 1>in your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that you processed the</v>

613
00:39:05.311 --> 00:39:07.620
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those things start to take on a life</v>

614
00:39:07.621 --> 00:39:09.450
<v Speaker 1>of a row of their own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those ideas.</v>

615
00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.433
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

616
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:17.050
<v Speaker 1>then he adds another dimension of</v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity to that by saying,</v>

617
00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:19.620
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're full of demons and,</v>

618
00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:24.770
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Jeannie's and they're all doing</v>

619
00:39:25.151 --> 00:39:27.520
<v Speaker 1>their own thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that happens to be.</v>

620
00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:32.050
<v Speaker 1>But each of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if left to their own devices,</v>

621
00:39:32.051 --> 00:39:35.560
<v Speaker 1>would attempt to remake the entire world</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there</v>

622
00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:38.013
<v Speaker 2>form.</v>

623
00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:43.940
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought of this from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a narrative point of view or from a</v>

624
00:39:45.871 --> 00:39:47.780
<v Speaker 1>symbolic point of view in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

625
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:48.240
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

626
00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.380
<v Speaker 1>in old stories and folktales and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairytales,</v>

627
00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:51.630
<v Speaker 1>you often have a,</v>

628
00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:54.580
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cyclops</v>

629
00:39:55.680 --> 00:40:00.680
<v Speaker 1>one night giants and there's a sexual</v>
<v Speaker 1>connotation to that which is,</v>

630
00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.170
<v Speaker 1>which is apropos that the psychoanalysts</v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

631
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:09.140
<v Speaker 1>would certainly point out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the one idea is that this thing is</v>

632
00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:14.200
<v Speaker 1>gigantic and wants one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's another way that Nietzsche</v>

633
00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:17.780
<v Speaker 1>is conceptualizing the fundamental</v>

634
00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:25.250
<v Speaker 1>structure of the human psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a dwelling place full of one I</v>

635
00:40:25.251 --> 00:40:27.710
<v Speaker 1>giants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're constantly,</v>

636
00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:30.010
<v Speaker 1>while one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one way of looking at is they're</v>

637
00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:33.380
<v Speaker 1>constantly at war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them wants to be the largest one.</v>

638
00:40:33.381 --> 00:40:36.620
<v Speaker 1>I giant and dominate everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then one of the things that,</v>

639
00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:38.660
<v Speaker 1>so in each,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes that argument further and he</v>

640
00:40:38.661 --> 00:40:41.480
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only is this always happening in</v>

641
00:40:41.481 --> 00:40:44.380
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then if you look at philosophy,</v>

642
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.750
<v Speaker 1>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it's a continual revelation of the</v>

643
00:40:47.751 --> 00:40:52.751
<v Speaker 1>attempt of some singular minded psychic</v>
<v Speaker 1>monster psychological monster to</v>

644
00:40:54.951 --> 00:40:59.480
<v Speaker 1>dominate the entire psychological</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure that are for the entire</v>

645
00:40:59.481 --> 00:41:01.490
<v Speaker 1>cultural structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And therefore the entire world.</v>

646
00:41:01.491 --> 00:41:05.690
<v Speaker 1>And then you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see in that the entire religious</v>

647
00:41:05.691 --> 00:41:10.691
<v Speaker 1>structure struggle of mankind to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>this vast polytheistic vision of reality</v>

648
00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:18.290
<v Speaker 1>and to organize it into some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>monotheistic,</v>

649
00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:22.400
<v Speaker 1>an integrated structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you could also consider</v>

650
00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:27.730
<v Speaker 1>indistinguishable from the civilizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the impulse that operates in human</v>

651
00:41:28.671 --> 00:41:30.980
<v Speaker 1>beings to become civilized.</v>

652
00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Because on the one it might be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible thing that one,</v>

653
00:41:35.301 --> 00:41:38.660
<v Speaker 1>one eyed monster emerge as to attempt to</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominate all the others.</v>

654
00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:41.390
<v Speaker 1>But then on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no difference between that and</v>

655
00:41:41.391 --> 00:41:45.710
<v Speaker 1>organizing something because to organize</v>
<v Speaker 1>something is to bring it all into a</v>

656
00:41:45.711 --> 00:41:50.711
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical structure with some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>singular value at the forefront.</v>

657
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:53.240
<v Speaker 1>And then the question might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

658
00:41:53.241 --> 00:41:56.930
<v Speaker 1>what should that singular value b and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then neat you would.</v>

659
00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:00.860
<v Speaker 1>That ties the whole argument back into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first sentences that he wrote at the</v>

660
00:42:00.861 --> 00:42:02.360
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the paragraph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

661
00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:05.180
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it that the philosopher is up</v>

662
00:42:05.181 --> 00:42:07.670
<v Speaker 1>to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the force that he serving?</v>

663
00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:11.030
<v Speaker 1>What is that unifying impulse?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of looking at it.</v>

664
00:42:11.031 --> 00:42:14.870
<v Speaker 1>If there's a unifying impulse and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only fallen prey to some internal</v>

665
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:17.930
<v Speaker 1>email,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's a unifying impulse to bring</v>

666
00:42:17.931 --> 00:42:21.860
<v Speaker 1>all of this together into some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>functional structure,</v>

667
00:42:21.861 --> 00:42:23.630
<v Speaker 1>what exactly might that look like?</v>

668
00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:31.400
<v Speaker 1>For every impulse is imperious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as such attempts to philosophize,</v>

669
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:36.670
<v Speaker 1>that's part of that sort of niches idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>of will to power in in its nascent form.</v>

670
00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:45.280
<v Speaker 1>All of these unconscious entities that</v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabit the human psyche are all alive</v>

671
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:49.490
<v Speaker 1>and they're trying to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to,</v>

672
00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:53.750
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to climb up the dominance</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and dominate because of course</v>

673
00:42:53.751 --> 00:42:57.950
<v Speaker 1>that's partly what lights does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because let's say from an evolutionary</v>

674
00:42:57.951 --> 00:43:01.880
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is probably more true for males</v>

675
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:06.910
<v Speaker 1>because there were less</v>
<v Speaker 1>effective in their attempts to replicate</v>

676
00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:13.280
<v Speaker 1>the distinction between climbing up a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hard keep,</v>

677
00:43:13.281 --> 00:43:16.370
<v Speaker 1>whatever that might happen to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And success is,</v>

678
00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:21.560
<v Speaker 1>there may be no distinction at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

679
00:43:21.561 --> 00:43:23.880
<v Speaker 1>well that just shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's nothing but willpower.</v>

680
00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:28.400
<v Speaker 1>But</v>
<v Speaker 1>that still doesn't answer one of the</v>

681
00:43:28.401 --> 00:43:33.370
<v Speaker 1>most fundamental questions is that power</v>
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to what?</v>

682
00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

683
00:43:39.781 --> 00:43:40.870
<v Speaker 1>So you can shut that off.</v>
