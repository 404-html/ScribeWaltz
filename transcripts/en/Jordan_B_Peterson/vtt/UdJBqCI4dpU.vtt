1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.520
<v Speaker 1>There are coffees that have the drawings</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you should have 343 pages and how,</v>

3
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.940
<v Speaker 1>how many drones are there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Susan,</v>

4
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:11.040
<v Speaker 1>you have the many of drawings at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>back of your book</v>

5
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.400
<v Speaker 1>for four drawings</v>
<v Speaker 1>living in the middle.</v>

6
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

7
00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:26.520
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's different,</v>

8
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.330
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll do the origin the way</v>

9
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.593
<v Speaker 1>you might want to put those into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>backs of your book because that's what </v>

10
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.250
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's good.</v>

11
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.460
<v Speaker 1>That looks like everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at 14 people,</v>

12
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.980
<v Speaker 1>so that's a good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

13
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:54.981
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to lecture for awhile and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then what you should have read today was</v>

14
00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.013
<v Speaker 1>the preface of the thing that you picked</v>
<v Speaker 1>up from noman coffee and the first </v>

15
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:05.760
<v Speaker 1>chapter which is called maps of </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

16
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.083
<v Speaker 1>In terms of this book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be reading it now and also </v>

17
00:01:16.991 --> 00:01:21.590
<v Speaker 1>for the next class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll go over this in some detail too,</v>

18
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.980
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll start,</v>

19
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.560
<v Speaker 1>if you have any questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel free to ask them.</v>

20
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.633
<v Speaker 1>I'll try to leave at least half an hour </v>
<v Speaker 1>up to hand open for general discussion </v>

21
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.490
<v Speaker 1>and really like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.473
<v Speaker 1>feel free to stop me at any point if </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying doesn't make any sense </v>

23
00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>or if you have some relevant associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>

24
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.533
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the first thing we have to figure </v>

25
00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:55.920
<v Speaker 1>out basically is what it is that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about in this course.</v>

26
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.233
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so we have to establish the </v>

27
00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:01.254
<v Speaker 1>domain of inquiry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's basically the purpose of today's </v>

28
00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:05.310
<v Speaker 1>lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

29
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.770
<v Speaker 1>the reason I got interested in this sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing as I mentioned to you last week</v>

30
00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:11.604
<v Speaker 1>was because I am interested in figuring </v>
<v Speaker 1>out why people are motivated to commit </v>

31
00:02:15.211 --> 00:02:16.044
<v Speaker 1>acts of aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really atrocious acts of aggression </v>

32
00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:21.210
<v Speaker 1>because that's the kind of I'm really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in in defense of their,</v>

33
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.040
<v Speaker 1>of their belief systems.</v>

34
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Probably mast if you can pull in </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere over there because they needed</v>

35
00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:32.444
<v Speaker 1>a closer with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you guys could just cram together </v>

36
00:02:36.271 --> 00:02:37.530
<v Speaker 1>a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you would,</v>

37
00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:41.170
<v Speaker 1>maybe we</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a few more people in here.</v>

38
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.873
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

39
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.200
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does everybody here have,</v>

40
00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:53.220
<v Speaker 1>is some of us</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>

41
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.870
<v Speaker 1>And does everybody have this book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

42
00:02:57.871 --> 00:03:01.130
<v Speaker 1>Is there anybody that wants this book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

43
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.800
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi</v>

44
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Noman</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>

45
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.150
<v Speaker 1>If you talked to the people that have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>clue,</v>

46
00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:43.984
<v Speaker 1>they're binding it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have been getting bound copies </v>

47
00:03:46.961 --> 00:03:50.260
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't get a phone call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell them it's supposed to be filed.</v>

48
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.273
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you don't want to pack that thing </v>

49
00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:56.210
<v Speaker 1>around them about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

50
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.800
<v Speaker 1>I know they're doing the Mona order only</v>
<v Speaker 1>basis now.</v>

51
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I ordered eight for the</v>

52
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.790
<v Speaker 1>copies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

53
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.993
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I didn't expect to get rid of 45 </v>

54
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.003
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So did you get one that didn't have any </v>

55
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.520
<v Speaker 1>high order?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're doing now.</v>

56
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.330
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also teach it at the extension school.</v>

57
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

58
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.553
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're done with procedural issues </v>

59
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.840
<v Speaker 1>theoretically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

60
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well reverse myself here again.</v>

61
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what we're going to talk about today,</v>

62
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.953
<v Speaker 1>let's start the story again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got interested in what I'm going to </v>

63
00:04:40.721 --> 00:04:41.554
<v Speaker 1>teach you about cause I was interested </v>
<v Speaker 1>in looking at motivation for social </v>

64
00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:44.374
<v Speaker 1>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I can get you to shut the door so </v>

65
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.850
<v Speaker 1>disturb the whole smaller</v>
<v Speaker 1>Illinois</v>

66
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.510
<v Speaker 1>with regards to the videotape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can ignore it,</v>

67
00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:12.430
<v Speaker 1>that would be best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no real purpose to it.</v>

68
00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:15.460
<v Speaker 1>I want the videotape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like you're going to be,</v>

69
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.290
<v Speaker 1>your comments are going to be one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

70
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.630
<v Speaker 1>Anyone tried to just know to worry about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

71
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.570
<v Speaker 1>Right</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I started giving some consideration</v>

72
00:05:29.351 --> 00:05:31.800
<v Speaker 1>to the problem of motivation for social </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict.</v>

73
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:34.543
<v Speaker 1>So I was interested in why people become</v>
<v Speaker 1>rigid in their ideological </v>

74
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:39.940
<v Speaker 1>identifications and their cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>identities.</v>

75
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.500
<v Speaker 1>And I was interested in really why </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals do that.</v>

76
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:45.363
<v Speaker 1>So I started to get interested in what </v>
<v Speaker 1>role social identity plays in </v>

77
00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:50.860
<v Speaker 1>information processing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is hence the title of this course,</v>

78
00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:51.694
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of wording and useless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is everyone knows that we </v>

79
00:05:56.261 --> 00:05:58.590
<v Speaker 1>have social identities and ideological </v>
<v Speaker 1>identities.</v>

80
00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:59.900
<v Speaker 1>They're religious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their cultural,</v>

81
00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:01.010
<v Speaker 1>their intellectual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

82
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:06.170
<v Speaker 1>But nobody's really paid much attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>to study how the representations of that</v>

83
00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:07.820
<v Speaker 1>cultural identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

84
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.290
<v Speaker 1>alter the manner in which we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we feel emotion,</v>

85
00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:13.124
<v Speaker 1>which perceive and by which we act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested in how our internal </v>

86
00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:20.840
<v Speaker 1>representations of our culture modulator</v>
<v Speaker 1>or emotional expression,</v>

87
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.820
<v Speaker 1>that's the best way to point and say you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

88
00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:25.640
<v Speaker 1>your brain basically is programmed as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're socialized.</v>

89
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:27.523
<v Speaker 1>That's what socialization is for and </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously it's socialization that </v>

90
00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:30.884
<v Speaker 1>instills cultural identity and equally </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously the process of socialization </v>

91
00:06:34.551 --> 00:06:35.384
<v Speaker 1>that leads to cultural identity must </v>
<v Speaker 1>have some impact on the way you think </v>

92
00:06:38.151 --> 00:06:38.984
<v Speaker 1>and obviously leave that on the way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind functions and the way that </v>

93
00:06:42.471 --> 00:06:43.304
<v Speaker 1>your brain functions and see North </v>
<v Speaker 1>American neuropsychologists have been </v>

94
00:06:47.661 --> 00:06:48.494
<v Speaker 1>loath to give any consideration to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of notion to think that cultural </v>

95
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:52.244
<v Speaker 1>transformations might have some direct </v>
<v Speaker 1>impact on physiological function by the </v>

96
00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.570
<v Speaker 1>time the Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By contrast,</v>

97
00:06:59.571 --> 00:07:00.404
<v Speaker 1>this has been a central tenant of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>nurses neuropsychological theories </v>

98
00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:03.254
<v Speaker 1>basically since since day one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is particularly true with regards </v>

99
00:07:06.261 --> 00:07:09.680
<v Speaker 1>to Alexander Luria and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

100
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.130
<v Speaker 1>what's his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gods scheme.</v>

101
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Now you can think about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite obvious if you think about it</v>

102
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.290
<v Speaker 1>for a second with regards to something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

103
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.880
<v Speaker 1>the capacity to read silently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here's the case that,</v>

104
00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.280
<v Speaker 1>well this is a relatively new talent.</v>

105
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean literacy is a new talent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

106
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Most people weren't able to read 500 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

107
00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:32.810
<v Speaker 1>It's only been 500 years and only for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit of that,</v>

108
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:33.853
<v Speaker 1>that the capacity to read has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>widespread and the capacity to read </v>

109
00:07:37.401 --> 00:07:41.390
<v Speaker 1>silently is a relatively new development</v>
<v Speaker 1>in human history.</v>

110
00:07:41.391 --> 00:07:42.224
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a cute your thing if you think </v>

111
00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:45.080
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that nonetheless,</v>

112
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:49.160
<v Speaker 1>the capacity to read silently localizes </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a specific part of the brain,</v>

113
00:07:49.161 --> 00:07:49.994
<v Speaker 1>which is to say it's as if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the brain that's evolved for </v>

114
00:07:53.631 --> 00:07:54.464
<v Speaker 1>that purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same place and everybody more </v>

115
00:07:56.451 --> 00:07:57.284
<v Speaker 1>or less their individual variations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are differences when people are </v>

116
00:07:59.781 --> 00:08:02.300
<v Speaker 1>lateralized differently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all that aside,</v>

117
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:03.283
<v Speaker 1>if you learn to read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a part of your brain that </v>

118
00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:05.474
<v Speaker 1>specializes for that and it's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>much the same place in every way and it </v>

119
00:08:08.151 --> 00:08:13.151
<v Speaker 1>wasn't there or wasn't doing that sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of activity 2000 years ago.</v>

120
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:14.870
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read at one point,</v>

121
00:08:14.871 --> 00:08:15.704
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where the reference to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like so many things that I make </v>

122
00:08:19.221 --> 00:08:20.054
<v Speaker 1>reference to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've had at one point that people </v>

123
00:08:21.441 --> 00:08:24.050
<v Speaker 1>thought Julius Caesar was a magician in </v>
<v Speaker 1>part.</v>

124
00:08:24.051 --> 00:08:25.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was obviously a remarkable </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

125
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:27.710
<v Speaker 1>but in part because he can read </v>
<v Speaker 1>silently,</v>

126
00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.130
<v Speaker 1>he didn't have to read a loud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it wasn't just reading.</v>

127
00:08:31.131 --> 00:08:31.964
<v Speaker 1>That was remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was being able to read without </v>

128
00:08:33.111 --> 00:08:34.580
<v Speaker 1>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

129
00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:39.230
<v Speaker 1>the point of all of this is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain,</v>

130
00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:40.064
<v Speaker 1>this is [inaudible] view of the brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally is your brain is an organ </v>

131
00:08:42.531 --> 00:08:45.690
<v Speaker 1>that produces sub organs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>culturally specific subordinates,</v>

132
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:46.573
<v Speaker 1>not it's that's it's remarkable capacity</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it can generate new molecules </v>

133
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:53.743
<v Speaker 1>that are specialized for certain tasks </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of environmental </v>

134
00:08:56.941 --> 00:09:00.360
<v Speaker 1>programming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an interesting sort of notion,</v>

135
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:04.270
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that at some level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiological there analysis,</v>

136
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.720
<v Speaker 1>at least your culture determines how </v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain works.</v>

137
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.340
<v Speaker 1>Now it's very classic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

138
00:09:08.341 --> 00:09:09.960
<v Speaker 1>your brain is very plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you were a child.</v>

139
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.823
<v Speaker 1>You can sustain immense amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cortical damage in childhood and still </v>

140
00:09:14.401 --> 00:09:16.020
<v Speaker 1>grow up normally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

141
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:19.080
<v Speaker 1>if you're a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very epileptic as a child,</v>

142
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.980
<v Speaker 1>sometimes what surgeons will do is take </v>
<v Speaker 1>out a whole hemisphere,</v>

143
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:24.083
<v Speaker 1>the whole right hemisphere gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And children who have hemisphere </v>

144
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.230
<v Speaker 1>activities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're done young enough,</v>

145
00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:31.710
<v Speaker 1>still grow up to be relatively normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite normal.</v>

146
00:09:31.711 --> 00:09:32.544
<v Speaker 1>In fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are other cases too where </v>

147
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.433
<v Speaker 1>people are hydrocephalic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which basically means that they're </v>

148
00:09:36.241 --> 00:09:39.990
<v Speaker 1>ventricles don't vamped properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

149
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.940
<v Speaker 1>and cerebral spinal fluid builds up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sculpt.</v>

150
00:09:42.941 --> 00:09:45.840
<v Speaker 1>So these people often have stalls that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are slightly larger than normal,</v>

151
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:49.140
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what steel case.</v>

152
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.093
<v Speaker 1>And they end up with a skull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's essentially full of liquid with a </v>

153
00:09:53.281 --> 00:09:54.114
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very thin layer of brain tissue around </v>

154
00:09:55.861 --> 00:09:58.320
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this all of liquid.</v>

155
00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:59.280
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

156
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.113
<v Speaker 1>there are a number of case reports of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who have like 5% of the aquatic </v>

157
00:10:03.721 --> 00:10:06.930
<v Speaker 1>and tissue intact who have high </v>
<v Speaker 1>functioning intelligence,</v>

158
00:10:06.931 --> 00:10:08.910
<v Speaker 1>his normal personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the point is,</v>

159
00:10:08.911 --> 00:10:11.220
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the higher cortical levels of</v>

160
00:10:11.221 --> 00:10:14.610
<v Speaker 1>your writing are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very functionally flexible.</v>

161
00:10:14.611 --> 00:10:16.890
<v Speaker 1>We can childhood now by the time you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>an adult,</v>

162
00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:18.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pattern changes a little bit done,</v>

163
00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.070
<v Speaker 1>kind of looks like your brain dies into </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's adult configuration.</v>

164
00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:22.953
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting we look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say you have way more </v>

165
00:10:24.961 --> 00:10:27.840
<v Speaker 1>neurons that you need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially right before you're born.</v>

166
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.910
<v Speaker 1>And a environment prunes your brain down</v>
<v Speaker 1>to its adult configuration.</v>

167
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:37.200
<v Speaker 1>So although of course you develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>connections as well,</v>

168
00:10:37.201 --> 00:10:38.760
<v Speaker 1>but you lose a lot of neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

169
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:41.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the time you're an adult,</v>

170
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.110
<v Speaker 1>you're brain is nowhere near as flexible</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it was when you were a child.</v>

171
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:45.953
<v Speaker 1>And if you sustain damage to certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of your brain that are already </v>

172
00:10:48.721 --> 00:10:50.070
<v Speaker 1>specialized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well and you know,</v>

173
00:10:50.071 --> 00:10:52.350
<v Speaker 1>then you have the damage and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>work around all that,</v>

174
00:10:52.351 --> 00:10:55.760
<v Speaker 1>but it can still be really prominent</v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

175
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.440
<v Speaker 1>So that's sort of the market and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

176
00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.333
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the department because it is the </v>

177
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:03.330
<v Speaker 1>rent adapts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas the body,</v>

178
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:04.770
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a great comment.</v>

179
00:11:04.771 --> 00:11:06.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you start thinking about that,</v>

180
00:11:06.211 --> 00:11:08.490
<v Speaker 1>it has really revolutionary implication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can say,</v>

181
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.473
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I have an idea that's really radical </v>

182
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:15.210
<v Speaker 1>and saying in a sense that changes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>configuration of my Cortex,</v>

183
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:19.440
<v Speaker 1>I can transmit that maybe not to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe your brain is already fixed,</v>

184
00:11:19.441 --> 00:11:20.274
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put down the generations and alter the </v>

185
00:11:21.841 --> 00:11:23.340
<v Speaker 1>structure of brains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand spores.</v>

186
00:11:23.341 --> 00:11:24.174
<v Speaker 1>So you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

187
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.150
<v Speaker 1>ideas can spread through a population </v>
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>

188
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.800
<v Speaker 1>That's a lamarche and sprint.</v>

189
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.430
<v Speaker 1>But even more interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is speculative of course,</v>

190
00:11:32.431 --> 00:11:33.264
<v Speaker 1>but let's say that Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are certain types of revolutions </v>

191
00:11:36.991 --> 00:11:40.590
<v Speaker 1>in thought that are actually the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of biological mutations.</v>

192
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:41.910
<v Speaker 1>So you could see that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

193
00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:42.803
<v Speaker 1>you're a particularly odd sort of person</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the genetic perspective and as a </v>

194
00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:48.300
<v Speaker 1>consequence you think in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very unique manner.</v>

195
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:49.463
<v Speaker 1>But the thing that's so interesting is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you can still communicate those </v>

196
00:11:52.381 --> 00:11:55.510
<v Speaker 1>thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the effect of that genetic mutation</v>

197
00:11:55.511 --> 00:11:56.344
<v Speaker 1>can be transmitted throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population without any biological </v>

198
00:11:58.391 --> 00:12:01.130
<v Speaker 1>alteration at the genetic level at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

199
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.013
<v Speaker 1>that's really something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's interesting because it </v>

200
00:12:04.061 --> 00:12:04.894
<v Speaker 1>means that the consequences of genetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>mutations on combination can spread </v>

201
00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:11.410
<v Speaker 1>through a population as fast as </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication can move.</v>

202
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.390
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

203
00:12:13.391 --> 00:12:14.224
<v Speaker 1>the Lamarckian does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody know what Lamar can </v>

204
00:12:15.791 --> 00:12:17.140
<v Speaker 1>transmission is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

205
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:21.340
<v Speaker 1>Lamarck was the character who thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the reason that that you could,</v>

206
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.370
<v Speaker 1>you could transmit acquired </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristics.</v>

207
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:25.203
<v Speaker 1>So the reason drafts that long the x is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it kept trying to stretch their </v>

208
00:12:28.601 --> 00:12:29.640
<v Speaker 1>net is basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

209
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.633
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they transmitted the capacity to do </v>

210
00:12:32.651 --> 00:12:33.484
<v Speaker 1>the stretching to their offspring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can transmit acquired </v>

211
00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:39.250
<v Speaker 1>characteristics down the genetic line </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's no,</v>

212
00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:40.720
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>

213
00:12:40.721 --> 00:12:41.554
<v Speaker 1>But that's what Lamar thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he wasn't completely wrong because </v>

214
00:12:43.541 --> 00:12:44.374
<v Speaker 1>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is how this sort of transmission </v>

215
00:12:45.581 --> 00:12:49.360
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's non genetically mediated cumulation</v>

216
00:12:49.361 --> 00:12:52.930
<v Speaker 1>of biological resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's very interesting.</v>

217
00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:53.590
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

218
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:55.180
<v Speaker 1>that's a good comment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

219
00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:57.610
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

220
00:12:57.611 --> 00:12:59.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of,</v>

221
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.300
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's some of the background of why I'm</v>

222
00:13:01.301 --> 00:13:04.810
<v Speaker 1>interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the neuropsychology of culture.</v>

223
00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.460
<v Speaker 1>And if you're interested in that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

224
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:08.500
<v Speaker 1>you want to read the golf ski and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to read Luria.</v>

225
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:09.543
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the Russians are really </v>

226
00:13:10.571 --> 00:13:11.404
<v Speaker 1>interested in the effect of culture on </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognition and the regulation of emotion </v>

227
00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:15.893
<v Speaker 1>on as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for a long time they were five </v>

228
00:13:18.461 --> 00:13:19.294
<v Speaker 1>decades of hand of North American Europe</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of exploring this sort of </v>

229
00:13:21.821 --> 00:13:22.654
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

230
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:26.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exactly sure why that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that is the case.</v>

231
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.860
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

232
00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:33.940
<v Speaker 1>Well the first thing that I started to </v>
<v Speaker 1>started to realize I guess,</v>

233
00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.330
<v Speaker 1>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is sort of an emergent realization.</v>

234
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:38.583
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't something that happened early </v>
<v Speaker 1>on when I was trying to develop these </v>

235
00:13:41.201 --> 00:13:43.920
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It became a way of making them clearer.</v>

236
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.273
<v Speaker 1>I started giving some consideration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess to the old philosophical </v>

237
00:13:48.401 --> 00:13:53.401
<v Speaker 1>distinction between facts and values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no</v>

238
00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.630
<v Speaker 1>values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could say value.</v>

239
00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:03.670
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of it in the domain of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be and uh,</v>

240
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:06.063
<v Speaker 1>or ethics and a fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's kind of in the domain of </v>

241
00:14:09.971 --> 00:14:14.920
<v Speaker 1>what actually is or what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what was more,</v>

242
00:14:14.921 --> 00:14:16.030
<v Speaker 1>what could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

243
00:14:16.031 --> 00:14:20.770
<v Speaker 1>taking the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>present and future consideration as long</v>

244
00:14:20.771 --> 00:14:24.310
<v Speaker 1>be known in philosophical circles that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make any,</v>

245
00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:27.130
<v Speaker 1>you can't draw any conclusions about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what should be,</v>

246
00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.880
<v Speaker 1>what ought to be from an analysis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>

247
00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.130
<v Speaker 1>which is to say you can't derive an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ought from an nice,</v>

248
00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:37.840
<v Speaker 1>and there's some sort of divide there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can sort of think of have this.</v>

249
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.033
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just knowing the particulars of the </v>

250
00:14:40.451 --> 00:14:43.150
<v Speaker 1>situation doesn't mean that you know how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to act there.</v>

251
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.970
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's really where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>division takes place,</v>

252
00:14:45.971 --> 00:14:46.804
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that come out with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>description of the characteristics of a </v>

253
00:14:49.361 --> 00:14:50.194
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like let's say you were from a lower </v>

254
00:14:52.131 --> 00:14:55.790
<v Speaker 1>working class family and you buy some </v>
<v Speaker 1>Miss Fortune.</v>

255
00:14:55.791 --> 00:14:56.624
<v Speaker 1>You have to go to La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Tuxedo ball where there'll be nothing </v>

256
00:15:01.971 --> 00:15:04.490
<v Speaker 1>but rich people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't really know how to act.</v>

257
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:08.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can describe the circumstances,</v>

258
00:15:08.091 --> 00:15:11.270
<v Speaker 1>you basically know what it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to encounter.</v>

259
00:15:11.271 --> 00:15:12.104
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't tell you anything at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all about how it is that you should </v>

260
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:15.793
<v Speaker 1>conduct yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing that's kind of </v>

261
00:15:16.821 --> 00:15:19.700
<v Speaker 1>interesting about that is that how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should conduct yourself.</v>

262
00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:23.340
<v Speaker 1>And this ties in directly to what we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to talk about today's game.</v>

263
00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.120
<v Speaker 1>You want to or what goal you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue.</v>

264
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to decide that a priority.</v>

265
00:15:29.031 --> 00:15:30.440
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to go to this party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

266
00:15:30.441 --> 00:15:32.480
<v Speaker 1>well I don't like people like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>

267
00:15:32.481 --> 00:15:36.670
<v Speaker 1>They're all capitalists exploiters and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they deserve my contempt.</v>

268
00:15:36.671 --> 00:15:39.530
<v Speaker 1>And so I'll go there and act miserably </v>
<v Speaker 1>and make everyone just like,</v>

269
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:41.660
<v Speaker 1>and that would be perfectly fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's an,</v>

270
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.420
<v Speaker 1>that's an odd as far as you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>

271
00:15:43.421 --> 00:15:46.800
<v Speaker 1>that's some moral injunction and if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>accept that line of reasoning,</v>

272
00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:47.663
<v Speaker 1>you're going to act one way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if your other line of reasoning as </v>

273
00:15:49.341 --> 00:15:50.174
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I have something to learn in this </v>

274
00:15:50.781 --> 00:15:52.490
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just shut up and watch.</v>

275
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:53.563
<v Speaker 1>Then what towards the tubes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ot under those circumstances to </v>

276
00:15:55.681 --> 00:15:58.550
<v Speaker 1>something completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know you can switch around.</v>

277
00:15:58.551 --> 00:16:03.100
<v Speaker 1>What the should be is by determining </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it is that you want to go.</v>

278
00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.300
<v Speaker 1>That's obviously not something you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>do with Fox,</v>

279
00:16:05.301 --> 00:16:08.520
<v Speaker 1>like whether you want to be liked or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you want to be hostile.</v>

280
00:16:08.521 --> 00:16:13.521
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing to do with like be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective aspects of the situation.</v>

281
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:15.650
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a real,</v>

282
00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.300
<v Speaker 1>so that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem.</v>

283
00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:21.110
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of the background.</v>

284
00:16:21.111 --> 00:16:22.250
<v Speaker 1>So let's go into this.</v>

285
00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:26.573
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

286
00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:30.930
<v Speaker 1>we all know that people have belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>

287
00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:35.370
<v Speaker 1>but we don't really know as far as I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell what that means.</v>

288
00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin belief system.</v>

289
00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:45.160
<v Speaker 1>This analysis sort of suggest that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't such thing is there,</v>

290
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.320
<v Speaker 1>there's no such thing as they belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>system is at the very minimum,</v>

291
00:16:48.321 --> 00:16:50.150
<v Speaker 1>my belief system is composed of two </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements,</v>

292
00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:50.993
<v Speaker 1>which is your description of how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world is from the factual perspective </v>

293
00:16:54.231 --> 00:16:56.870
<v Speaker 1>and also your description of how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world should be.</v>

294
00:16:56.871 --> 00:17:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Or You could say your interpretation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality of phenomena.</v>

295
00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:01.693
<v Speaker 1>It also your interpretation of how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should act with regards to those </v>

296
00:17:03.741 --> 00:17:05.990
<v Speaker 1>phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at the very least when you're talking</v>

297
00:17:05.991 --> 00:17:06.824
<v Speaker 1>about beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about something that has </v>

298
00:17:07.581 --> 00:17:12.581
<v Speaker 1>to constituent elements</v>
<v Speaker 1>always be known for a long time.</v>

299
00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:13.873
<v Speaker 1>Now it strikes me that there's a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an analogous division in human </v>

300
00:17:19.281 --> 00:17:21.960
<v Speaker 1>cognition between fact and value that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you wait,</v>

301
00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:25.220
<v Speaker 1>describe that as the division between </v>
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>

302
00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:27.783
<v Speaker 1>Math.</v>

303
00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.113
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

304
00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:36.813
<v Speaker 1>We don't really fight with people over </v>
<v Speaker 1>what things are from the scientific </v>

305
00:17:39.911 --> 00:17:43.810
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in part because</v>

306
00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:46.613
<v Speaker 1>unless you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I emotionally identified with your </v>

307
00:17:48.361 --> 00:17:51.150
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which basically means unless you're,</v>

308
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:56.190
<v Speaker 1>you imbued your theory with dreams of </v>
<v Speaker 1>career for example,</v>

309
00:17:56.191 --> 00:18:00.150
<v Speaker 1>or dreams of prestige or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you scientific theories pretty</v>

310
00:18:00.151 --> 00:18:03.270
<v Speaker 1>much as good as the next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that from the scientific</v>

311
00:18:03.271 --> 00:18:04.920
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all facts are equivalent.</v>

312
00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.890
<v Speaker 1>They don't have any intrinsic emotional </v>
<v Speaker 1>significance.</v>

313
00:18:07.891 --> 00:18:08.724
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to be objective with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to your description of the </v>

314
00:18:10.801 --> 00:18:13.110
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't really have to fight about what</v>

315
00:18:13.111 --> 00:18:14.970
<v Speaker 1>the world is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From a scientific perspective.</v>

316
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:19.110
<v Speaker 1>It's partly because there's not so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion involved in it.</v>

317
00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.810
<v Speaker 1>All that happens sometimes that's more </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a contamination.</v>

318
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:23.970
<v Speaker 1>Then something central to the scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>enterprise.</v>

319
00:18:23.971 --> 00:18:25.170
<v Speaker 1>People are always trying to get rid of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

320
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:26.183
<v Speaker 1>You don't mess around with your data to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it turn out the way you want it to </v>

321
00:18:28.651 --> 00:18:29.484
<v Speaker 1>because the way you want things to turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>out has nothing to do with the </v>

322
00:18:31.921 --> 00:18:34.200
<v Speaker 1>scientific enterprise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in part.</v>

323
00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:36.413
<v Speaker 1>The other thing is from the scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective is we have a method of </v>

324
00:18:39.391 --> 00:18:41.370
<v Speaker 1>solving arguments in the scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

325
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.620
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can put whatever you're competing.</v>

326
00:18:43.621 --> 00:18:44.454
<v Speaker 1>Hypotheses are about the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things to a task and in a sense if you </v>

327
00:18:48.241 --> 00:18:49.074
<v Speaker 1>can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're talking about is probably </v>

328
00:18:49.951 --> 00:18:54.390
<v Speaker 1>not scientific at all or that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>funding at the very least.</v>

329
00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.330
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot of emotion and tangled</v>

330
00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.650
<v Speaker 1>into scientific viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

331
00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:00.120
<v Speaker 1>second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there is a problem,</v>

332
00:19:00.121 --> 00:19:01.560
<v Speaker 1>a dispute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a very,</v>

333
00:19:01.561 --> 00:19:02.394
<v Speaker 1>very formalized mechanism for working it</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and people are usually willing to </v>

334
00:19:05.671 --> 00:19:08.160
<v Speaker 1>abide by that because well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it works.</v>

335
00:19:08.161 --> 00:19:08.994
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's demonstrated its utility from the </v>

336
00:19:10.831 --> 00:19:13.350
<v Speaker 1>pragmatic perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus it's comprehensible.</v>

337
00:19:13.351 --> 00:19:14.610
<v Speaker 1>You can outline all the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

338
00:19:14.611 --> 00:19:17.390
<v Speaker 1>we really have a strategy for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even have to be very bright to</v>

339
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.233
<v Speaker 1>scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is be very thorough </v>

340
00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:23.910
<v Speaker 1>and follow the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a making explicit,</v>

341
00:19:23.911 --> 00:19:27.700
<v Speaker 1>the scientific procedure that happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 500 years ago there boats,</v>

342
00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:29.123
<v Speaker 1>we know how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know how to come up with a </v>

343
00:19:31.441 --> 00:19:32.274
<v Speaker 1>description of the world from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensory perspective that everyone can </v>

344
00:19:35.491 --> 00:19:36.220
<v Speaker 1>agree with them.</v>

345
00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.310
<v Speaker 2>We're less okay.</v>

346
00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:42.160
<v Speaker 1>That isn't what we fight with people.</v>

347
00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:43.493
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

348
00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:49.380
<v Speaker 1>What's important to us is not what </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are so much as what they mean and</v>

349
00:19:49.541 --> 00:19:53.320
<v Speaker 1>so then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well in a sense what does meaning me?</v>

350
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:54.423
<v Speaker 1>And that's much the same as asking what </v>
<v Speaker 1>is an emotion or what is a motivational </v>

351
00:19:58.031 --> 00:20:01.900
<v Speaker 1>state or what does it drive state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These things of what we have proved very</v>

352
00:20:01.901 --> 00:20:02.734
<v Speaker 1>difficult to nail down in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the meaning of meaning but well </v>

353
00:20:06.991 --> 00:20:08.890
<v Speaker 1>aren't going to give you a provisional </v>
<v Speaker 1>definition.</v>

354
00:20:08.891 --> 00:20:12.340
<v Speaker 1>And that is the meeting of something has</v>
<v Speaker 1>its implication for behavior.</v>

355
00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:14.283
<v Speaker 1>And I mean that literally and behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the act of propelling your body </v>

356
00:20:17.621 --> 00:20:18.454
<v Speaker 1>through space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's at least one dimension of </v>

357
00:20:20.351 --> 00:20:21.184
<v Speaker 1>meeting.</v>

358
00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.790
<v Speaker 1>There are more profound levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>

359
00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.060
<v Speaker 1>You could also say that something is </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful.</v>

360
00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:35.450
<v Speaker 1>If it has implications for the Schema </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you use to generate behaviors,</v>

361
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:38.580
<v Speaker 1>that's a more profound piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

362
00:20:38.581 --> 00:20:39.414
<v Speaker 1>Something that's more profoundly </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful cause then a phenomenon and </v>

363
00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:45.450
<v Speaker 1>event that occurs can change your </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction to hold classes of the fans.</v>

364
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:46.463
<v Speaker 1>That's a really been phenomenal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we are not going to discuss that so </v>

365
00:20:49.061 --> 00:20:49.894
<v Speaker 1>much today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll just stick with the simple </v>

366
00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:54.430
<v Speaker 1>definition meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is implication for behavior and,</v>

367
00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:59.320
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give an example in the chapter that</v>

368
00:20:59.321 --> 00:21:03.550
<v Speaker 1>you were to read today about a girl</v>
<v Speaker 1>little girl,</v>

369
00:21:03.551 --> 00:21:07.330
<v Speaker 1>three years old or whatever she is </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploring her environment.</v>

370
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.320
<v Speaker 1>We tend to think that when someone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploring their environment,</v>

371
00:21:11.321 --> 00:21:12.154
<v Speaker 1>what they're trying to do is map the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensory properties of that which </v>

372
00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:18.340
<v Speaker 1>surrounds them and that's how we think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the girl in the example I use,</v>

373
00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:19.413
<v Speaker 1>well what she's wandering around </v>
<v Speaker 1>touching things and poking about using </v>

374
00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:24.720
<v Speaker 1>all the exploratory tools that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't heard disposal,</v>

375
00:21:24.721 --> 00:21:29.030
<v Speaker 1>some of which she thinks up and some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what she coffees and she approaches a an</v>

376
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:34.070
<v Speaker 1>antique table and on top of the table </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was a very fragile green glass</v>

377
00:21:34.871 --> 00:21:35.704
<v Speaker 1>antique vase and she reaches up to touch</v>
<v Speaker 1>it in the course of her exploratory </v>

378
00:21:38.951 --> 00:21:41.740
<v Speaker 1>activity and your mother immediately </v>
<v Speaker 1>shrieked no,</v>

379
00:21:41.741 --> 00:21:42.580
<v Speaker 1>don't touch that.</v>

380
00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:43.413
<v Speaker 1>Comes over and grabs her hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulls it back six zero nine and it says </v>

381
00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:50.860
<v Speaker 1>that's not something for you to touch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you see</v>

382
00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:53.673
<v Speaker 1>the girl has just discovered something </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what that thing is from the </v>

383
00:21:56.951 --> 00:21:59.170
<v Speaker 1>motivational perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say,</v>

384
00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:03.220
<v Speaker 1>well you can view that object is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that has sensory properties,</v>

385
00:22:03.221 --> 00:22:06.040
<v Speaker 1>but you can also view it as something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has motivational significance.</v>

386
00:22:06.041 --> 00:22:06.874
<v Speaker 1>Then the motivational significance in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this case for that child is ambivalent </v>

387
00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:12.250
<v Speaker 1>because the thing is interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's green and it's shining.</v>

388
00:22:12.251 --> 00:22:13.084
<v Speaker 1>The draws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the explorer Tory candidates candidacy </v>

389
00:22:14.591 --> 00:22:16.330
<v Speaker 1>out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she wants to approach it,</v>

390
00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's also something that's linked </v>
<v Speaker 1>with punishment.</v>

391
00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:20.283
<v Speaker 1>So that's an ambivalent phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much of what we do when we map our </v>

392
00:22:23.381 --> 00:22:25.990
<v Speaker 1>environments is map them for </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational significance.</v>

393
00:22:25.991 --> 00:22:26.824
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're so good at being </v>

394
00:22:27.581 --> 00:22:28.414
<v Speaker 1>scientists or we have become so good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>being scientist for the last 500 years </v>

395
00:22:31.361 --> 00:22:32.020
<v Speaker 1>or so.</v>

396
00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.820
<v Speaker 1>We tend to think that when we mapped the</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

397
00:22:33.821 --> 00:22:36.190
<v Speaker 1>what we're mapping it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four is it sensory properties,</v>

398
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.900
<v Speaker 1>but as far as I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

399
00:22:37.901 --> 00:22:41.020
<v Speaker 1>you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals are not scientists,</v>

400
00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.420
<v Speaker 1>so whatever they're doing is not a can </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide.</v>

401
00:22:43.421 --> 00:22:44.254
<v Speaker 1>It's accepted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more primitive and it's more </v>

402
00:22:45.671 --> 00:22:46.504
<v Speaker 1>permanent form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever animals are doing is more like </v>

403
00:22:48.401 --> 00:22:50.780
<v Speaker 1>whenever it was that we were doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>before we became sides.</v>

404
00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:51.640
<v Speaker 1>So you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

405
00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:52.493
<v Speaker 1>what was that we were doing whenever </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was 150,000 years ago or 250,000 </v>

406
00:22:56.351 --> 00:22:59.560
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we still managed to Mac the environments</v>

407
00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.960
<v Speaker 1>because we can live in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously we're all still here,</v>

408
00:23:01.961 --> 00:23:02.794
<v Speaker 1>so our relatives were pretty good at our</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestors were pretty good at doing </v>

409
00:23:04.871 --> 00:23:05.704
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We weren't doing it from the scientific </v>

410
00:23:06.761 --> 00:23:08.440
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are doing something else.</v>

411
00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:10.443
<v Speaker 1>What we were doing is mapping the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment for implications for </v>

412
00:23:12.161 --> 00:23:12.994
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

413
00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:17.620
<v Speaker 1>You see it when you really want to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this good and heart because if you</v>

414
00:23:17.621 --> 00:23:18.490
<v Speaker 1>think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

415
00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.353
<v Speaker 1>it'll start changing the way you view </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world because it answers some </v>

416
00:23:22.811 --> 00:23:25.060
<v Speaker 1>strange questions that are otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult answers.</v>

417
00:23:25.061 --> 00:23:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you stop asking questions about,</v>

418
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:31.533
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the scientific perspective that </v>

419
00:23:33.041 --> 00:23:35.170
<v Speaker 1>you're surrounded by a certified of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mysteries.</v>

420
00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:37.180
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing you comprehend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

421
00:23:37.181 --> 00:23:40.720
<v Speaker 1>In your field of experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more questions about the factual</v>

422
00:23:40.721 --> 00:23:41.554
<v Speaker 1>nature of things wherever you look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes you ask questions and </v>

423
00:23:43.961 --> 00:23:48.961
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you don't know what is it that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stops us in any given circumstance.</v>

424
00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:50.923
<v Speaker 1>You can't answer that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you start thinking about how it is </v>

425
00:23:52.341 --> 00:23:53.174
<v Speaker 1>that people think scientifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can only answer it if you start </v>

426
00:23:55.521 --> 00:23:56.354
<v Speaker 1>thinking about how does that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>think from the motivational perspective </v>

427
00:23:58.821 --> 00:24:02.480
<v Speaker 1>because I can tell you that you'll stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>asking questions.</v>

428
00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Say about like I don't know any of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>very well,</v>

429
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:06.403
<v Speaker 1>at least at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that I don't know what you're </v>

430
00:24:07.881 --> 00:24:12.830
<v Speaker 1>very well isn't compelling me to do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount of exploration because</v>

431
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:13.783
<v Speaker 1>I know you well enough so that I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>predict your behavior in this </v>

432
00:24:15.831 --> 00:24:16.664
<v Speaker 1>circumstance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that I have a very </v>

433
00:24:18.261 --> 00:24:19.094
<v Speaker 1>detailed vision in my mind of where this</v>
<v Speaker 1>next two hours is going to go in terms </v>

434
00:24:23.781 --> 00:24:28.520
<v Speaker 1>of the whole two hour period in every </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of sub temporal aspect of that down</v>

435
00:24:28.521 --> 00:24:29.354
<v Speaker 1>to the immediate present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as long as none of you violate my </v>

436
00:24:32.001 --> 00:24:32.834
<v Speaker 1>preset positions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to ask any questions about </v>

437
00:24:34.851 --> 00:24:37.790
<v Speaker 1>you cause I've taught you math and </v>
<v Speaker 1>likewise for me,</v>

438
00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.040
<v Speaker 1>as long as things go according to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>predictions,</v>

439
00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.630
<v Speaker 1>you know the world and the thing you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to predict is the,</v>

440
00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:46.250
<v Speaker 1>the effect that your behavior has on </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena.</v>

441
00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:49.400
<v Speaker 1>In terms of motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

442
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:52.040
<v Speaker 1>so you can just sort of keep that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

443
00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.190
<v Speaker 1>So look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

444
00:24:55.191 --> 00:24:56.024
<v Speaker 1>we think two different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One way is being formalized and that's </v>

445
00:24:58.341 --> 00:25:01.270
<v Speaker 1>the scientific way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the scientific enterprise is,</v>

446
00:25:01.271 --> 00:25:02.104
<v Speaker 1>is the attempt to come up with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate description of the sensory </v>

447
00:25:05.241 --> 00:25:09.230
<v Speaker 1>properties of phenomena in so far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>those are collectively apprehensible.</v>

448
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:10.303
<v Speaker 1>But just to say that we want to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what things are from the sensory </v>

449
00:25:12.771 --> 00:25:13.604
<v Speaker 1>perspective and we engage in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate an exercise to determine </v>

450
00:25:17.091 --> 00:25:17.924
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if I want to figure out what </v>

451
00:25:18.651 --> 00:25:22.370
<v Speaker 1>this is from the scientific perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>is much more effective.</v>

452
00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:24.283
<v Speaker 1>If I could have a thousand people </v>
<v Speaker 1>working on it all at once and we're all </v>

453
00:25:26.541 --> 00:25:29.270
<v Speaker 1>communicating our knowledge and we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>build out a very detailed picture of the</v>

454
00:25:29.271 --> 00:25:30.104
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the only reason we want to do that </v>

455
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:32.263
<v Speaker 1>so that we can track the motivational </v>
<v Speaker 1>significance of things more accurate to </v>

456
00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:36.403
<v Speaker 1>say once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why does an animal care if something is </v>

457
00:25:39.011 --> 00:25:40.130
<v Speaker 1>green rather than red?</v>

458
00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:41.743
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may be because being able to </v>

459
00:25:43.191 --> 00:25:44.024
<v Speaker 1>discriminate colors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally we're finally means more </v>

460
00:25:46.281 --> 00:25:49.790
<v Speaker 1>accurate mapping of the motivational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational relevance.</v>

461
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:52.880
<v Speaker 1>Just to say that if you can only see in </v>
<v Speaker 1>black and white for example,</v>

462
00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:59.030
<v Speaker 1>if something that's the same hue red is </v>
<v Speaker 1>poisoning as something edible green,</v>

463
00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.160
<v Speaker 1>well you've had it cause you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinguish them.</v>

464
00:26:01.161 --> 00:26:03.800
<v Speaker 1>If you can want to see black and white </v>
<v Speaker 1>know if you can see color,</v>

465
00:26:03.801 --> 00:26:06.320
<v Speaker 1>which means you can make a finer level </v>
<v Speaker 1>of sensory discrimination.</v>

466
00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.470
<v Speaker 1>You can keep better track of where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>good things are,</v>

467
00:26:09.471 --> 00:26:11.930
<v Speaker 1>where the bad things are and as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm concerned,</v>

468
00:26:11.931 --> 00:26:14.900
<v Speaker 1>that's really why we do science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the final analysis when you get like,</v>

469
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:15.823
<v Speaker 1>cause you've got to ask what's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation for doing all these kinds of </v>

470
00:26:17.511 --> 00:26:19.120
<v Speaker 1>things and looking at the fruit flies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

471
00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:19.963
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to keep track of where the </v>

472
00:26:21.591 --> 00:26:22.424
<v Speaker 1>motivational significance is up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things are and we can do that better by </v>

473
00:26:25.311 --> 00:26:26.144
<v Speaker 1>making finer and finer discriminations </v>
<v Speaker 1>between things because then we could </v>

474
00:26:28.611 --> 00:26:29.444
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this thing is that and this thing </v>

475
00:26:31.191 --> 00:26:34.580
<v Speaker 1>is that and it's useful to be able to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

476
00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:38.090
<v Speaker 1>What I don't understand the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between interest and value.</v>

477
00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.740
<v Speaker 1>When a cat made me value the food days </v>
<v Speaker 1>batty,</v>

478
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:43.640
<v Speaker 1>that is not necessarily interested it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

479
00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:44.723
<v Speaker 1>but still he places value on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't understand the word how that </v>

480
00:26:46.801 --> 00:26:47.634
<v Speaker 1>works out.</v>

481
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Well things we are interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that have value.</v>

482
00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.730
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think that I value having </v>
<v Speaker 1>interests.</v>

483
00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:03.453
<v Speaker 1>So is normally don't think about food is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's interesting if you're a food </v>

484
00:27:06.991 --> 00:27:09.690
<v Speaker 1>deprived and it's not if you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it depends on your,</v>

485
00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.330
<v Speaker 1>it depends on your current state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation.</v>

486
00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:16.630
<v Speaker 1>So you can never identify anything is </v>
<v Speaker 1>having interest as an,</v>

487
00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:17.513
<v Speaker 1>an intrinsic aspect of that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something we'll cover in more </v>

488
00:27:20.311 --> 00:27:23.070
<v Speaker 1>detail too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if something is valuable to you,</v>

489
00:27:23.071 --> 00:27:23.904
<v Speaker 1>your interest in the weather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the valence is positive or negative so </v>

490
00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.980
<v Speaker 1>that interests can fluctuate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>

491
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:30.720
<v Speaker 1>and when you ask a question like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

492
00:27:30.721 --> 00:27:34.140
<v Speaker 1>you want to make sure that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>discriminated in your own mind.</v>

493
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.780
<v Speaker 1>The difference between the two terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're using.</v>

494
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:40.020
<v Speaker 1>So there's obviously some overlap </v>
<v Speaker 1>between interest and value.</v>

495
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:43.650
<v Speaker 1>It strikes me that probably what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>referring to is that um,</v>

496
00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:45.173
<v Speaker 1>the things that have no specify </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological significance but that are </v>

497
00:27:48.391 --> 00:27:50.130
<v Speaker 1>unpredictable are interesting.</v>

498
00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:52.203
<v Speaker 1>Something like food is valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might be able to say that the </v>

499
00:27:53.991 --> 00:27:57.960
<v Speaker 1>interest is the more general phenomena </v>
<v Speaker 1>of value before it's being discriminated</v>

500
00:27:57.961 --> 00:28:00.250
<v Speaker 1>into its sub components.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

501
00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.820
<v Speaker 1>Cause if something unexpected happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it attracts your interest,</v>

502
00:28:02.821 --> 00:28:03.654
<v Speaker 1>which means that you value it but you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have no determination of the value of </v>

503
00:28:06.171 --> 00:28:07.004
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can only say here is something that </v>

504
00:28:08.341 --> 00:28:09.174
<v Speaker 1>I didn't predict and then the purpose of</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration is to is to put it into the </v>

505
00:28:12.631 --> 00:28:15.030
<v Speaker 1>appropriate boxes or something that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to,</v>

506
00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:16.013
<v Speaker 1>you want to give some consideration to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause that's like in a sense that's one </v>

507
00:28:18.061 --> 00:28:18.894
<v Speaker 1>of the most fundamental things that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>want you to to to learn is that when we </v>

508
00:28:23.011 --> 00:28:23.844
<v Speaker 1>classify things using exploration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not attributing meaning to </v>

509
00:28:26.881 --> 00:28:27.714
<v Speaker 1>something that has a neutral background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're taking something that has a very </v>

510
00:28:30.751 --> 00:28:35.070
<v Speaker 1>broad range of nonspecific meaning and </v>
<v Speaker 1>restricting it to something specific.</v>

511
00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:37.650
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

512
00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:38.573
<v Speaker 1>we'll make it more cooperative and take </v>
<v Speaker 1>a wrap by the tail and you drop them </v>

513
00:28:40.921 --> 00:28:43.800
<v Speaker 1>into a new cage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interest is everywhere.</v>

514
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:46.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not one specific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The racks going to sit there like this.</v>

515
00:28:46.831 --> 00:28:47.664
<v Speaker 1>First of all it's going to be paralyzed </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it doesn't move like it's motor </v>

516
00:28:49.411 --> 00:28:51.480
<v Speaker 1>systems are inhibited by its anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

517
00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.030
<v Speaker 1>It is not moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason it's not moving,</v>

518
00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:57.660
<v Speaker 1>well the rab doesn't know this but this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is what we would presume the reason it's</v>

519
00:28:57.661 --> 00:28:58.494
<v Speaker 1>not moving is because</v>
<v Speaker 1>in novel territory there may be a </v>

520
00:29:02.191 --> 00:29:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Predator and if you don't move and </v>
<v Speaker 1>predators can't see it,</v>

521
00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:05.933
<v Speaker 1>so the route of sits there like this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it'll sniff a little bit cause </v>

522
00:29:07.621 --> 00:29:08.970
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't draw any attention to </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

523
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:14.120
<v Speaker 1>And if nothing happens that kills it </v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly it starts to unwind a little bit.</v>

524
00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.190
<v Speaker 1>And then it's the systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bda curiosity,</v>

525
00:29:17.191 --> 00:29:18.024
<v Speaker 1>which are the incentive reward systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>technically start driving the route </v>

526
00:29:20.611 --> 00:29:21.444
<v Speaker 1>around and the rattle explorer and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's trying to do is reduce the </v>

527
00:29:24.091 --> 00:29:29.091
<v Speaker 1>nonspecific value of the novel </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment to something specified,</v>

528
00:29:29.251 --> 00:29:30.720
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you could say in a sense.</v>

529
00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:32.970
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything here that will hurt </v>
<v Speaker 1>me?</v>

530
00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:36.420
<v Speaker 1>So it's looking for punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually looking to avoid them.</v>

531
00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:37.830
<v Speaker 1>But once they know where the hell they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

532
00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:40.230
<v Speaker 1>is there anything here that will make me</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxious,</v>

533
00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:41.183
<v Speaker 1>which is to say is there anything here </v>
<v Speaker 1>that signifies that the punishment is </v>

534
00:29:43.361 --> 00:29:46.990
<v Speaker 1>likely?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything here that I can eat or</v>

535
00:29:46.991 --> 00:29:50.980
<v Speaker 1>they will otherwise satisfy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I consuming Tory requirements or</v>

536
00:29:50.981 --> 00:29:51.814
<v Speaker 1>is there anything here that will signify</v>
<v Speaker 1>the presence of something that will </v>

537
00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:57.760
<v Speaker 1>satisfy by conservatory reprivatise </v>
<v Speaker 1>those are four categories.</v>

538
00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.340
<v Speaker 1>Punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction,</v>

539
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.310
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And hope basically.</v>

540
00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.433
<v Speaker 1>And what the route is trying to do is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>restrict the indeterminate significance </v>

541
00:30:07.991 --> 00:30:10.930
<v Speaker 1>of the normal circumstance to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>discriminant category.</v>

542
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.033
<v Speaker 1>Which is to say it wants to know exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>where all the things that have </v>

543
00:30:15.401 --> 00:30:16.234
<v Speaker 1>determined value are located.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly it's going to map nothing cause </v>

544
00:30:19.991 --> 00:30:20.750
<v Speaker 1>that's the alternative.</v>

545
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:24.730
<v Speaker 1>Calculates no relevance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most of the things around you,</v>

546
00:30:24.731 --> 00:30:26.700
<v Speaker 1>our map into that box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you'd think,</v>

547
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:27.543
<v Speaker 1>well your reactions in this room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the phenomena in this room or </v>

548
00:30:29.951 --> 00:30:32.330
<v Speaker 1>not attracting your attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean you can,</v>

549
00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:36.700
<v Speaker 1>you can divert your attention to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you like those things,</v>

550
00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:39.550
<v Speaker 1>those are irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how had I not pointed them out?</v>

551
00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps you'd remember they were there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps what they signify.</v>

552
00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:44.463
<v Speaker 1>Nothing from the motivational </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective so you've mapped them is </v>

553
00:30:46.991 --> 00:30:49.840
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant in most of the things you map</v>
<v Speaker 1>are mapped as irrelevant.</v>

554
00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:52.900
<v Speaker 1>That is now they start with no started </v>
<v Speaker 1>out as novel.</v>

555
00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:57.860
<v Speaker 1>That's the fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the old position and</v>

556
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:27.850
<v Speaker 1>does the historical progression guess</v>

557
00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:43.060
<v Speaker 1>say for the sake of argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scientific method was establish more</v>

558
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:44.820
<v Speaker 1>last 500 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

559
00:31:44.821 --> 00:31:45.654
<v Speaker 1>well it was at that point where are our </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological models of reality and our </v>

560
00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.750
<v Speaker 1>scientific split.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

561
00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:54.953
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to ask you to swallow a </v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition for the time being and </v>

562
00:31:58.021 --> 00:31:58.854
<v Speaker 1>that presupposition is that town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll take me a while to explain the </v>

563
00:32:01.891 --> 00:32:06.050
<v Speaker 1>logic behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

564
00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.450
<v Speaker 1>you know how you get scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

565
00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:10.403
<v Speaker 1>It's basically talk to you explicitly </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can read experiments and you </v>

566
00:32:13.711 --> 00:32:17.370
<v Speaker 1>read theories and so on are the explicit</v>
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>

567
00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:20.670
<v Speaker 1>but how you pick up knowledge of how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>act well,</v>

568
00:32:20.671 --> 00:32:23.100
<v Speaker 1>that's not quite as explicit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as easy to figure out.</v>

569
00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:24.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously you model,</v>

570
00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:27.570
<v Speaker 1>we know that children pick up a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation by modeling behavior,</v>

571
00:32:27.571 --> 00:32:29.640
<v Speaker 1>which is basic English is a big coffee </v>
<v Speaker 1>adults,</v>

572
00:32:29.641 --> 00:32:32.250
<v Speaker 1>and that basically means they watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>adults act,</v>

573
00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:33.293
<v Speaker 1>move their bodies who space and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>duplicate those patterns of action any </v>

574
00:32:35.761 --> 00:32:36.594
<v Speaker 1>generalized from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's one way behavioral wisdom </v>

575
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.620
<v Speaker 1>transmitting.</v>

576
00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:40.453
<v Speaker 1>Some of it's explicit as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in terms of the receipt of </v>

577
00:32:42.771 --> 00:32:43.604
<v Speaker 1>rewards and punishments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because parents will modulate their </v>

578
00:32:46.281 --> 00:32:47.114
<v Speaker 1>children's behavior by engaging in </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivationally significant interactions </v>

579
00:32:50.211 --> 00:32:51.044
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least that's what you should do if </v>

580
00:32:51.711 --> 00:32:52.544
<v Speaker 1>you're a parent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your primary responsibility in a </v>

581
00:32:55.161 --> 00:32:55.994
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what we mean when we say that </v>

582
00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:58.963
<v Speaker 1>you're paying attention to someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It basically means that you're </v>

583
00:33:00.381 --> 00:33:02.660
<v Speaker 1>modulating their behavior with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>

584
00:33:02.661 --> 00:33:07.250
<v Speaker 1>with your emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fuck a child will monitor,</v>

585
00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:11.870
<v Speaker 1>our parent will monitor his child and </v>
<v Speaker 1>react positively when something that the</v>

586
00:33:11.871 --> 00:33:14.510
<v Speaker 1>parent wants to happen happens and </v>
<v Speaker 1>native glee.</v>

587
00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.630
<v Speaker 1>When something happens that the parent </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want to happen.</v>

588
00:33:16.631 --> 00:33:17.464
<v Speaker 1>So the child's behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's just the classical </v>

589
00:33:19.581 --> 00:33:20.414
<v Speaker 1>reinforcement theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically you exchange rewards and </v>

590
00:33:22.431 --> 00:33:25.190
<v Speaker 1>punishments and threats and promises and</v>
<v Speaker 1>more human behavior.</v>

591
00:33:25.191 --> 00:33:27.320
<v Speaker 1>We do that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your interpersonal interactions,</v>

592
00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:29.983
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the reason why people </v>
<v Speaker 1>with personality disorders can sort of </v>

593
00:33:31.791 --> 00:33:36.220
<v Speaker 1>have an uncanny effect on which is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say if your personality disorder,</v>

594
00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:39.800
<v Speaker 1>do you have a really potent expectation </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how someone else will behave?</v>

595
00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.410
<v Speaker 1>Usually like a son of a bitch?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally.</v>

596
00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:43.753
<v Speaker 1>And if someone with a personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder encounter someone who doesn't </v>

597
00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:47.083
<v Speaker 1>back like that and they're a challenge </v>
<v Speaker 1>to their belief system and even with </v>

598
00:33:49.281 --> 00:33:51.860
<v Speaker 1>personality disorders are extremely good</v>
<v Speaker 1>at turning.</v>

599
00:33:51.861 --> 00:33:55.880
<v Speaker 1>Everyone may meet into the same person </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they already met and they do that I</v>

600
00:33:55.881 --> 00:33:59.360
<v Speaker 1>think by exchanging very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very subtle and covert reinforcements,</v>

601
00:33:59.361 --> 00:34:01.990
<v Speaker 1>which is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're engaged with me.</v>

602
00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:02.893
<v Speaker 1>I have a personality disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time you act properly I'll ignore </v>

603
00:34:05.181 --> 00:34:08.310
<v Speaker 1>you or say something contemptuous or </v>
<v Speaker 1>look away or do something quite saddled.</v>

604
00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.430
<v Speaker 1>And every time you act like a miserable </v>
<v Speaker 1>bastard,</v>

605
00:34:10.431 --> 00:34:13.700
<v Speaker 1>which is what I expect all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least pay some attention and possibly</v>

606
00:34:13.701 --> 00:34:16.940
<v Speaker 1>even reinforce you covertly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'll find if you get close to me,</v>

607
00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:18.013
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like you've been distorted </v>

608
00:34:19.101 --> 00:34:19.934
<v Speaker 1>by a gravitational field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As your behavior starts getting pulled </v>

609
00:34:21.801 --> 00:34:22.940
<v Speaker 1>in strange directions.</v>

610
00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:27.450
<v Speaker 1>We do that to each other all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things you might consider</v>

611
00:34:27.451 --> 00:34:31.580
<v Speaker 1>it as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our societies are very large.</v>

612
00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:33.423
<v Speaker 1>We're all engaged in these patterns of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mutually modifying interactions and </v>

613
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.530
<v Speaker 1>something emerges from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stable,</v>

614
00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:42.950
<v Speaker 1>and I guess I would say that the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to teach you about mythologies</v>

615
00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:47.030
<v Speaker 1>are the things that I do as stable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emergent properties from risk,</v>

616
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:50.030
<v Speaker 1>from centuries of reciprocal </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction.</v>

617
00:34:50.390 --> 00:34:51.223
<v Speaker 1>So if we're engaged in some pursuit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to modify me and I'm going </v>

618
00:34:54.201 --> 00:34:55.034
<v Speaker 1>to modify you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and neither of us really know precisely </v>

619
00:34:57.381 --> 00:34:58.214
<v Speaker 1>what that means because we're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious of all the reasons that we do </v>

620
00:35:01.041 --> 00:35:02.660
<v Speaker 1>everything and have to spend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

621
00:35:02.661 --> 00:35:04.100
<v Speaker 1>it's bad enough if there's only two of </v>
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

622
00:35:04.101 --> 00:35:04.934
<v Speaker 1>but if there's like 50 of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you can imagine that </v>

623
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:08.023
<v Speaker 1>calculating all the permutations of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interactions becomes virtually </v>

624
00:35:10.581 --> 00:35:11.414
<v Speaker 1>impossible.</v>

625
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:12.343
<v Speaker 1>The point is we will settle into some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of stable configuration or </v>

626
00:35:15.561 --> 00:35:16.394
<v Speaker 1>important or will disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the options and a human </v>

627
00:35:20.601 --> 00:35:21.434
<v Speaker 1>societies do so settle into stable </v>
<v Speaker 1>configurations and we don't really </v>

628
00:35:23.901 --> 00:35:26.270
<v Speaker 1>understand how that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we,</v>

629
00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:28.423
<v Speaker 1>we have developed the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>describe those configurations without </v>

630
00:35:31.461 --> 00:35:32.294
<v Speaker 1>understanding and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that makes up a big part of </v>

631
00:35:33.711 --> 00:35:34.544
<v Speaker 1>mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So miss are the stories we tell </v>

632
00:35:36.471 --> 00:35:37.304
<v Speaker 1>ourselves how we behave when we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know how it is that we behave or even </v>

633
00:35:40.081 --> 00:35:44.340
<v Speaker 1>why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when a file that when you know things</v>

634
00:35:44.341 --> 00:35:46.110
<v Speaker 1>to consider in the future,</v>

635
00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.900
<v Speaker 1>let's go back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

636
00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:05.300
<v Speaker 1>Was there some connection between what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

637
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:06.583
<v Speaker 1>the distinction you were just making him</v>
<v Speaker 1>the declarative declarative memory that </v>

638
00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:11.810
<v Speaker 1>just talks about yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

639
00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll discuss.</v>

640
00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:15.140
<v Speaker 1>We'll discuss that in some detail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the is,</v>

641
00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:17.750
<v Speaker 1>so you have these three separate memory </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>

642
00:36:17.751 --> 00:36:21.130
<v Speaker 1>One of them's knowing non declarative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which basically it's nonrepresentational</v>

643
00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:22.280
<v Speaker 1>ducks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the procedural system,</v>

644
00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.290
<v Speaker 1>procedural memory governance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your motor output.</v>

645
00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.390
<v Speaker 1>If it's habitual under an employee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

646
00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:27.403
<v Speaker 1>You use your procedural memory to walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>with because walking is way too </v>

647
00:36:29.451 --> 00:36:32.150
<v Speaker 1>complicated to do as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

648
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:36.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's such a complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you can't think about how to walk.</v>

649
00:36:36.381 --> 00:36:37.580
<v Speaker 1>It's a habit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a skill.</v>

650
00:36:37.581 --> 00:36:39.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you play the piano,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know a piece off by heart,</v>

651
00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:41.173
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you think about it while your</v>
<v Speaker 1>fingers stumble over themselves because </v>

652
00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:45.310
<v Speaker 1>it's too complicated to think about.</v>

653
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:48.680
<v Speaker 1>You can't handle all that information in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your interactive conscious.</v>

654
00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:49.693
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've coded a lot of behavioral </v>

655
00:36:50.841 --> 00:36:53.420
<v Speaker 1>information in our procedural systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

656
00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:55.760
<v Speaker 1>it's not declarative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not representation.</v>

657
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:57.560
<v Speaker 1>It's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

658
00:36:57.590 --> 00:36:58.423
<v Speaker 1>I think part of what a story is is it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the representation of the patterns of </v>

659
00:37:02.451 --> 00:37:04.610
<v Speaker 1>behavior that are coded in a procedural </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>

660
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:07.870
<v Speaker 1>So you see when we're engaged in any </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of interaction,</v>

661
00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:08.713
<v Speaker 1>you and I are both modifying the </v>
<v Speaker 1>contents of our procedural memory </v>

662
00:37:11.391 --> 00:37:16.391
<v Speaker 1>systems by exchanging to put it very </v>
<v Speaker 1>harshly by exchanging reinforcements.</v>

663
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:19.610
<v Speaker 1>We do not understand the nature of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern.</v>

664
00:37:19.611 --> 00:37:20.444
<v Speaker 1>That's the outcome of that exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we can watch it and that's what the </v>

665
00:37:23.961 --> 00:37:25.480
<v Speaker 1>story is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's our,</v>

666
00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.840
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's our,</v>

667
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:27.703
<v Speaker 1>our episodic memory system that kicks up</v>
<v Speaker 1>images basically cause we'll get it </v>

668
00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:32.653
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your right hemisphere is good at </v>

669
00:37:33.461 --> 00:37:35.100
<v Speaker 1>recognizing patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

670
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:36.290
<v Speaker 1>and your behaviors.</v>

671
00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:39.430
<v Speaker 1>Behaviors have patterns obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you can predict behaviors.</v>

672
00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:42.013
<v Speaker 1>One of the ways that we make those </v>
<v Speaker 1>patens explicit is by making images of </v>

673
00:37:45.201 --> 00:37:48.570
<v Speaker 1>them and then describing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's basically my story and we,</v>

674
00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:49.413
<v Speaker 1>you get a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically what you're doing is you're </v>

675
00:37:50.781 --> 00:37:54.350
<v Speaker 1>using words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>activate images of behaviors.</v>

676
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:56.023
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to instill behavioral </v>

677
00:37:57.501 --> 00:38:00.890
<v Speaker 1>patterns by doing that anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't understand the story.</v>

678
00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.980
<v Speaker 1>That's all BS.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of stories we tell our kids</v>

679
00:38:03.981 --> 00:38:08.680
<v Speaker 1>that we have a little foggy snowstorms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fairy Tales would like that.</v>

680
00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:09.913
<v Speaker 1>Very peculiar stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the kids are interested in them and </v>

681
00:38:11.961 --> 00:38:13.830
<v Speaker 1>they'll listen to them over and over and</v>
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

682
00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:15.753
<v Speaker 1>And that's because there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information in those stories like that </v>

683
00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:22.250
<v Speaker 1>or than you can possibly imagine all </v>
<v Speaker 1>embedded in those stories.</v>

684
00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:26.300
<v Speaker 1>And the person who's listening to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't understand it and the person was</v>

685
00:38:26.301 --> 00:38:27.134
<v Speaker 1>telling it doesn't understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the inflammation is still </v>

686
00:38:29.661 --> 00:38:30.494
<v Speaker 1>transmitted.</v>

687
00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:32.270
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very peculiar.</v>

688
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:35.090
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I started thinking about that because</v>

689
00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:35.973
<v Speaker 1>was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well when I started understanding that </v>

690
00:38:37.871 --> 00:38:40.900
<v Speaker 1>religious systems of thought actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>had some meaning,</v>

691
00:38:40.901 --> 00:38:41.734
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the stories they were telling were </v>

692
00:38:42.551 --> 00:38:44.530
<v Speaker 1>accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I couldn't figure out,</v>

693
00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:45.520
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they are accurate,</v>

694
00:38:45.521 --> 00:38:48.430
<v Speaker 1>how the hell did they develop?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If no one understands what they mean,</v>

695
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:49.840
<v Speaker 1>if which is impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

696
00:38:49.841 --> 00:38:50.674
<v Speaker 1>It's like how do you develop a system of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought in the absence of any </v>

697
00:38:53.711 --> 00:38:55.840
<v Speaker 1>understanding of what the system means?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

698
00:38:55.841 --> 00:38:58.120
<v Speaker 1>that seems like a complete with insulin </v>
<v Speaker 1>and with our problem,</v>

699
00:38:58.750 --> 00:38:59.770
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

700
00:38:59.771 --> 00:39:00.604
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

701
00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:01.573
<v Speaker 1>you don't point about something similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>with dream to set up a dream will </v>

702
00:39:04.301 --> 00:39:08.530
<v Speaker 1>sometimes give you a premonition of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>future state and he didn't mean that you</v>

703
00:39:08.531 --> 00:39:10.600
<v Speaker 1>could interpret the future by reading </v>
<v Speaker 1>your dreams.</v>

704
00:39:10.601 --> 00:39:14.210
<v Speaker 1>He meant that the thing that you will </v>
<v Speaker 1>become is in,</v>

705
00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:15.213
<v Speaker 1>in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>operative now it's in its nascent form </v>

706
00:39:18.641 --> 00:39:23.350
<v Speaker 1>and on that nascent form has more to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with dream structure and imagination.</v>

707
00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:25.940
<v Speaker 1>And it does with anything explicit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can interpret your dream,</v>

708
00:39:25.941 --> 00:39:27.940
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you can see where it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're headed.</v>

709
00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:29.590
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the same mystery.</v>

710
00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:30.603
<v Speaker 1>How is it that your brain can know where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be when you can't even </v>

711
00:39:32.591 --> 00:39:33.424
<v Speaker 1>understand what that means?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's why there's multiple memory </v>

712
00:39:35.471 --> 00:39:36.304
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Theory is really useful because you can </v>

713
00:39:37.541 --> 00:39:38.374
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

714
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:40.330
<v Speaker 1>look at social animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

715
00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:44.080
<v Speaker 1>Like a wolf obviously does not have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>declarative representation of the nature</v>

716
00:39:44.081 --> 00:39:45.610
<v Speaker 1>of its social structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

717
00:39:45.611 --> 00:39:48.910
<v Speaker 1>it knows who's white on the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and knows how to behave,</v>

718
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.790
<v Speaker 1>but it can't describe it's patterns of </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

719
00:39:51.791 --> 00:39:55.660
<v Speaker 1>They're not conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning they're not representational,</v>

720
00:39:55.661 --> 00:39:56.494
<v Speaker 1>they're not declared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're still there and they're </v>

721
00:39:58.091 --> 00:40:01.060
<v Speaker 1>there because they've been selected for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Darwinian perspective.</v>

722
00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:02.163
<v Speaker 1>It's like these patterns of interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's certain patterns of social </v>

723
00:40:04.151 --> 00:40:04.840
<v Speaker 1>interaction.</v>

724
00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:08.470
<v Speaker 1>They're stable over time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They emerge as a consequence of a social</v>

725
00:40:08.471 --> 00:40:09.304
<v Speaker 1>interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they emerge way before the groups </v>

726
00:40:12.101 --> 00:40:12.934
<v Speaker 1>that have the patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what the patterns are and </v>

727
00:40:15.461 --> 00:40:16.294
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our attempts to spin stories are </v>

728
00:40:18.191 --> 00:40:19.024
<v Speaker 1>descriptions of those patterns of action</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we understand what they are </v>

729
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:23.460
<v Speaker 1>giving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example of that same,</v>

730
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:25.063
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have said that everything in </v>

731
00:40:26.921 --> 00:40:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Freud is in Shakespeare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing about about Shakespeare is</v>

732
00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.520
<v Speaker 1>that nothing in Shakespeare's explicit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still all story,</v>

733
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:35.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was great spinner of drama,</v>

734
00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:38.200
<v Speaker 1>all Shakespeare's plays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plays,</v>

735
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:41.710
<v Speaker 1>which was a reference to behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All Shakespeare's plays are</v>

736
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:44.343
<v Speaker 1>images of patterns of action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can say what Freud did in so far as </v>

737
00:40:47.261 --> 00:40:50.950
<v Speaker 1>you grant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's theorizing Craig's is make an image</v>

738
00:40:50.951 --> 00:40:51.784
<v Speaker 1>of a pattern of behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explicit representation from the </v>

739
00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:57.250
<v Speaker 1>perspective of some manner from </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective of words.</v>

740
00:40:57.730 --> 00:40:59.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same with maths.</v>

741
00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:02.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean we miss her full of wisdom about </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>

742
00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.300
<v Speaker 1>but it hasn't yet been made explicit.</v>

743
00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:06.413
<v Speaker 1>And now the problem with us of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that we think we know our hands are </v>

744
00:41:09.071 --> 00:41:09.904
<v Speaker 1>full of a lot of bizarre nonsense and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes it very difficult for us to </v>

745
00:41:12.341 --> 00:41:14.740
<v Speaker 1>figure out what it me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that brings me back to this.</v>

746
00:41:14.741 --> 00:41:16.130
<v Speaker 1>This is where I'm telling you this whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

747
00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:16.973
<v Speaker 1>It's 500 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scientific methodology was four </v>

748
00:41:21.011 --> 00:41:23.770
<v Speaker 1>formalized when we found out very </v>
<v Speaker 1>rapidly.</v>

749
00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:25.143
<v Speaker 1>Let me read you something from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's talking about the typical attitude </v>

750
00:41:28.331 --> 00:41:29.164
<v Speaker 1>that commit evil individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the Orthodox Christian media </v>

751
00:41:31.091 --> 00:41:31.924
<v Speaker 1>evil individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to realize that hundred </v>

752
00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:35.380
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the in Europe site,</v>

753
00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:36.373
<v Speaker 1>although there might've been sectarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences within the Christian </v>

754
00:41:38.631 --> 00:41:41.280
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in most cases you are Christian.</v>

755
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:44.840
<v Speaker 1>Not because that's what you believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because the world that you lived in,</v>

756
00:41:44.841 --> 00:41:45.674
<v Speaker 1>was it Christian world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like you had 15 different </v>

757
00:41:47.991 --> 00:41:48.824
<v Speaker 1>belief systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of which were equally coherent to </v>

758
00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:51.650
<v Speaker 1>sort of choose between.</v>

759
00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:55.070
<v Speaker 1>It was that the world you inhabit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was Christian.</v>

760
00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.320
<v Speaker 1>That was the explanation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

761
00:41:57.860 --> 00:41:59.690
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young said,</v>

762
00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:03.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't till culture start mixing.</v>

763
00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:05.420
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't take like a Muslim if you're a</v>

764
00:42:05.421 --> 00:42:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you've met one.</v>

765
00:42:06.771 --> 00:42:09.410
<v Speaker 1>And if they're not around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the issue doesn't even come up.</v>

766
00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:10.603
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see how totally different than </v>

767
00:42:13.001 --> 00:42:14.930
<v Speaker 1>the world appear to medieval man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For him,</v>

768
00:42:14.931 --> 00:42:15.764
<v Speaker 1>the Earth was eternally fixed and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest in the center of the universe and </v>

769
00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:21.070
<v Speaker 1>circled by the course of a son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's statistically,</v>

770
00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:23.180
<v Speaker 1>there's stone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more men.</v>

771
00:42:23.181 --> 00:42:25.700
<v Speaker 1>We're all children of God under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>loving care of the most high,</v>

772
00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:27.710
<v Speaker 1>who prepared them for an eternal </v>
<v Speaker 1>blessedness,</v>

773
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.823
<v Speaker 1>and they all knew exactly what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>should do and how they should conduct </v>

774
00:42:30.531 --> 00:42:33.260
<v Speaker 1>themselves in order to rise from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>corruptible world.</v>

775
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:37.460
<v Speaker 1>Do an incorruptible and joyous </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence,</v>

776
00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:41.180
<v Speaker 1>such a life no longer seems real to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even in our dreams.</v>

777
00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Natural sciences long ago torn this </v>
<v Speaker 1>lovely veil to shreds.</v>

778
00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:49.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least you know at the,</v>

779
00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:50.443
<v Speaker 1>from a fundamental perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know perfectly well that the earth </v>

780
00:42:52.381 --> 00:42:53.214
<v Speaker 1>was not the center of the cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least not in the way that it was </v>

781
00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:57.590
<v Speaker 1>procedure from the medieval perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was very,</v>

782
00:42:57.591 --> 00:43:01.460
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly after the scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>methodology became formulated.</v>

783
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:02.503
<v Speaker 1>Scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're generating observations like mad </v>

784
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:05.983
<v Speaker 1>that seemed to exist in direct conflict </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the most fundamental statements of </v>

785
00:43:09.441 --> 00:43:11.220
<v Speaker 1>religious systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

786
00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:12.283
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the sun was at the center </v>

787
00:43:13.911 --> 00:43:17.180
<v Speaker 1>of the will of the universe originally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

788
00:43:17.181 --> 00:43:19.010
<v Speaker 1>we don't even believe that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just some,</v>

789
00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>semio obscure star,</v>

790
00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:21.843
<v Speaker 1>not all that particularly powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often some backwater corner of one </v>

791
00:43:24.351 --> 00:43:25.184
<v Speaker 1>galaxy among hundreds of billions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>galaxies in the universe that's so big </v>

792
00:43:28.071 --> 00:43:29.780
<v Speaker 1>that you can't even comprehend.</v>

793
00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:31.123
<v Speaker 1>So I mean that's a different picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course the logical conclusion to </v>

794
00:43:34.551 --> 00:43:35.384
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the to say the so same sort of thing </v>

795
00:43:36.501 --> 00:43:37.334
<v Speaker 1>happened to Galileo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The heavens were supposed to be perfect </v>

796
00:43:38.901 --> 00:43:40.610
<v Speaker 1>from the medieval perspective and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>never plan.</v>

797
00:43:40.611 --> 00:43:41.444
<v Speaker 1>It was supposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to have a perfectly circular </v>

798
00:43:44.211 --> 00:43:48.110
<v Speaker 1>orbit even because of the circle was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most perfect of figures and the moon was</v>

799
00:43:48.111 --> 00:43:50.750
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be something that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely without blemish.</v>

800
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:51.703
<v Speaker 1>Since it was part of the heavenly order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Galileo with his telescope showed that </v>

801
00:43:54.891 --> 00:43:55.724
<v Speaker 1>there were mountains on the moon and </v>
<v Speaker 1>praise that he attempted to demonstrate </v>

802
00:43:57.951 --> 00:43:58.784
<v Speaker 1>this to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to look through the telescope </v>

803
00:43:59.361 --> 00:44:00.194
<v Speaker 1>because for there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for reasons that we're going to discuss </v>

804
00:44:02.451 --> 00:44:04.280
<v Speaker 1>that this course continues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point is,</v>

805
00:44:04.281 --> 00:44:05.114
<v Speaker 1>is that very rapidly after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>formalization of the scientific </v>

806
00:44:07.671 --> 00:44:08.504
<v Speaker 1>methodology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our ability to regard mythic </v>

807
00:44:11.961 --> 00:44:14.990
<v Speaker 1>descriptions of the world as valid was </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially destroyed.</v>

808
00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:18.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is,</v>

809
00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:20.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like you to think about this and</v>

810
00:44:20.991 --> 00:44:21.824
<v Speaker 1>see if there's anything wrong with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation because it seems so simple </v>

811
00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:24.443
<v Speaker 1>that it's observed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think we made a big mistake of </v>

812
00:44:26.451 --> 00:44:27.284
<v Speaker 1>logic somewhere along way because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>made the presupposition that what we </v>

813
00:44:30.291 --> 00:44:31.124
<v Speaker 1>were doing when we were doing science </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the same thing that we were doing </v>

814
00:44:33.211 --> 00:44:37.890
<v Speaker 1>when we were doing religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that what religion was,</v>

815
00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:41.800
<v Speaker 1>was an attempt to describe the world in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same terms or are,</v>

816
00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:42.420
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

817
00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:45.450
<v Speaker 1>tending to the same phenomenon that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>attend to when we're doing science.</v>

818
00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:47.700
<v Speaker 1>So then we have the general attitude </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

819
00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:50.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what religion was at bask was sort of a,</v>

820
00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.013
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a science with an abysmally poor </v>

821
00:44:53.881 --> 00:44:55.890
<v Speaker 1>methodology based on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

822
00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.410
<v Speaker 1>erratic and unpredictable and biased </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

823
00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:00.240
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>observations.</v>

824
00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:04.560
<v Speaker 1>There were all designed to produce a </v>
<v Speaker 1>given an all the religious people seem,</v>

825
00:45:04.561 --> 00:45:05.394
<v Speaker 1>you seem to have a sort of swollen that </v>
<v Speaker 1>more or less whole as far as I can tell </v>

826
00:45:09.661 --> 00:45:10.494
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

827
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:14.520
<v Speaker 1>obviously these are generalizations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurosurgeon exceptions,</v>

828
00:45:14.521 --> 00:45:15.354
<v Speaker 1>but people still seem to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was that religious religion </v>

829
00:45:17.431 --> 00:45:19.170
<v Speaker 1>is doing is the same thing that science </v>
<v Speaker 1>is doing.</v>

830
00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:20.003
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a different viewpoint in the </v>

831
00:45:21.751 --> 00:45:22.584
<v Speaker 1>same plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get these weird arguments say </v>

832
00:45:24.111 --> 00:45:27.300
<v Speaker 1>between fundamentalist Christians and </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary biologists,</v>

833
00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:33.520
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about different worlds </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they don't know on either side,</v>

834
00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:34.463
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that</v>

835
00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:36.953
<v Speaker 1>I want to tell you at least in part what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nature of the world that the miss </v>

836
00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:45.450
<v Speaker 1>described is and how it differs from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific world.</v>

837
00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:50.810
<v Speaker 1>And the basic premise of this is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>why medstar concerned about is the world</v>

838
00:45:51.181 --> 00:45:54.580
<v Speaker 1>that you act the act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he's trying to describes.</v>

839
00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:56.160
<v Speaker 1>So miffed tells you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

840
00:45:56.161 --> 00:45:56.994
<v Speaker 1>here's how human experience is </v>
<v Speaker 1>structured with regards to how you </v>

841
00:46:01.621 --> 00:46:04.050
<v Speaker 1>should act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that big a surprise.</v>

842
00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:04.943
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion is concerned with morality and </v>

843
00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:07.193
<v Speaker 1>morality is the study of how the APP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it doesn't seem like such a major </v>

844
00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:11.363
<v Speaker 1>leap in some regards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems peculiar that people </v>

845
00:46:13.501 --> 00:46:14.334
<v Speaker 1>couldn't have figured out</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a general like in a general sense </v>

846
00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:19.163
<v Speaker 1>that what religions were doing and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>science we're doing where we're not </v>

847
00:46:21.301 --> 00:46:23.130
<v Speaker 1>really convince her they weren't in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same domain.</v>

848
00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:25.830
<v Speaker 1>Science is concerned with facts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>

849
00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:30.120
<v Speaker 1>Stories are concerned to value and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know a story has a moral right.</v>

850
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:31.980
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're supposed to derive </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the story.</v>

851
00:46:31.981 --> 00:46:34.140
<v Speaker 1>You take primitive stories like aesop's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fables,</v>

852
00:46:34.141 --> 00:46:34.974
<v Speaker 1>the is made explicit at the end here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the characters and acting out </v>

853
00:46:37.471 --> 00:46:38.304
<v Speaker 1>their roles and here's the behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 1>information you're supposed to derive </v>

854
00:46:40.861 --> 00:46:43.320
<v Speaker 1>from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Analyze the story for the moral.</v>

855
00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:46.620
<v Speaker 1>The moral is in the light of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior which you just received.</v>

856
00:46:46.621 --> 00:46:47.454
<v Speaker 1>How it is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it that you should adjust your </v>

857
00:46:48.961 --> 00:46:49.794
<v Speaker 1>ongoing behavior?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the kind of information that </v>

858
00:46:51.361 --> 00:46:52.194
<v Speaker 1>stories have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stories provide you with information </v>

859
00:46:54.031 --> 00:46:54.864
<v Speaker 1>about how to act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the information about the </v>

860
00:46:56.371 --> 00:46:58.950
<v Speaker 1>motivational significance of things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations.</v>

861
00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:03.150
<v Speaker 1>And when you have a story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good story about a given situation,</v>

862
00:47:03.151 --> 00:47:03.984
<v Speaker 1>you know how to ask and knowing how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>act inhibits your anxiety because </v>

863
00:47:07.711 --> 00:47:09.540
<v Speaker 1>knowing how to act means that we need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do something.</v>

864
00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:10.373
<v Speaker 1>You can predict outcome and as long as </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are predictable outcomes all </v>

865
00:47:12.631 --> 00:47:14.280
<v Speaker 1>around you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>

866
00:47:14.281 --> 00:47:15.114
<v Speaker 1>anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's knowing how to act and inhibits </v>

867
00:47:17.851 --> 00:47:19.120
<v Speaker 1>your anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say,</v>

868
00:47:19.121 --> 00:47:19.954
<v Speaker 1>well then it's not much of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition that it's stories that </v>

869
00:47:23.401 --> 00:47:24.234
<v Speaker 1>inhibits your anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that none of us are made </v>

870
00:47:26.071 --> 00:47:26.904
<v Speaker 1>anxious by any of the other people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this room is fundamentally because you </v>

871
00:47:29.651 --> 00:47:32.170
<v Speaker 1>share the same stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we act in a predictable way.</v>

872
00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:38.720
<v Speaker 1>So when you mess with someone's story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're messing up the structure they use</v>

873
00:47:38.721 --> 00:47:41.800
<v Speaker 1>to attribute determinant significance to</v>
<v Speaker 1>objects and situations.</v>

874
00:47:42.570 --> 00:47:46.570
<v Speaker 1>And</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can mess with someone's story nearly</v>

875
00:47:46.571 --> 00:47:50.110
<v Speaker 1>by behaving in your own peculiarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>culturally determined way.</v>

876
00:47:50.111 --> 00:47:53.890
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't to be among foreigners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to say anything.</v>

877
00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:54.863
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the words sufficient are perhaps even </v>

878
00:47:56.771 --> 00:47:57.604
<v Speaker 1>more potent than behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just your mere existence poses a </v>

879
00:48:00.761 --> 00:48:01.750
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of threat.</v>

880
00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

881
00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:08.663
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he observes something similar to what </v>

882
00:48:11.531 --> 00:48:13.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>About a hundred years ago we said,</v>

883
00:48:13.331 --> 00:48:14.500
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm [inaudible],</v>

884
00:48:14.650 --> 00:48:17.330
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've worked,</v>

885
00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:18.373
<v Speaker 1>we've like pouring the intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>foundations out of Christianity using </v>

886
00:48:22.901 --> 00:48:23.734
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we all run around acting like </v>

887
00:48:25.751 --> 00:48:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Christians more or less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is his employment.</v>

888
00:48:28.931 --> 00:48:30.610
<v Speaker 1>He started about Europeans here a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred years.</v>

889
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:33.640
<v Speaker 1>So this is peculiar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

890
00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:36.370
<v Speaker 1>you might debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can think to yourself,</v>

891
00:48:36.371 --> 00:48:38.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't act like a Christian or whatever</v>

892
00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:40.900
<v Speaker 1>it is that your particular religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>background has to me.</v>

893
00:48:40.901 --> 00:48:41.734
<v Speaker 1>But of course that's really quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous because you did not advance </v>

894
00:48:44.041 --> 00:48:45.460
<v Speaker 1>all your behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

895
00:48:45.461 --> 00:48:46.990
<v Speaker 1>you probably imagined almost none of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

896
00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:48.093
<v Speaker 1>most of them are copied their coffee </v>
<v Speaker 1>from your parents or from other people </v>

897
00:48:50.531 --> 00:48:51.570
<v Speaker 1>that you matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

898
00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:53.400
<v Speaker 1>from significant others throughout your </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole life,</v>

899
00:48:53.401 --> 00:48:54.300
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from books he read,</v>

900
00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:56.110
<v Speaker 1>from movies you've watched and so on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so forth.</v>

901
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:57.303
<v Speaker 1>In so far as you are inculturated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your behaviors are not your only </v>

902
00:49:00.311 --> 00:49:02.290
<v Speaker 1>advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the whole purpose of college.</v>

903
00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:04.600
<v Speaker 1>He had to invent every one of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors.</v>

904
00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:06.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd never get anywhere.</v>

905
00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:07.413
<v Speaker 1>So you coffee behaviors that have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulated by humanity over large </v>

906
00:49:10.661 --> 00:49:11.494
<v Speaker 1>periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whether you think you have a </v>

907
00:49:13.241 --> 00:49:14.860
<v Speaker 1>religious based morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>

908
00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:18.010
<v Speaker 1>It's really knowing the issue because </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do,</v>

909
00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:20.463
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

910
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Human human society as being religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>for like</v>

911
00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:29.830
<v Speaker 1>veering or nearing the hundred percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>of its entire developmental history.</v>

912
00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:34.370
<v Speaker 1>You don't shake that in 500 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean really</v>

913
00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:39.950
<v Speaker 1>religions to boldly be explicitly </v>
<v Speaker 1>tumbling down the cents</v>

914
00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:47.800
<v Speaker 1>per hundred years with the rise of big </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological systems to replace.</v>

915
00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:51.880
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as I'm concerned,</v>

916
00:49:51.881 --> 00:49:52.714
<v Speaker 1>the system like communism or any </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian system mass just get </v>

917
00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:58.980
<v Speaker 1>replaced with religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

918
00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Nisha said when one gives up Christian </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief,</v>

919
00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:04.773
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thereby deprives oneself with the </v>

920
00:50:06.491 --> 00:50:07.324
<v Speaker 1>right to Christian morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity's the system consistently </v>

921
00:50:11.231 --> 00:50:12.064
<v Speaker 1>thought out and complete view of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If one breaks out of been a fundamental </v>

922
00:50:14.891 --> 00:50:17.350
<v Speaker 1>idea like the belief in God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

923
00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:19.840
<v Speaker 1>on their by breaks the whole thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces.</v>

924
00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:23.300
<v Speaker 1>What is nothing of any consequence left </v>
<v Speaker 1>in one's hands.</v>

925
00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:24.903
<v Speaker 1>Christianity presupposes the man does </v>
<v Speaker 1>not know and cannot know what is good </v>

926
00:50:27.711 --> 00:50:29.770
<v Speaker 1>for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what evil he believes in God.</v>

927
00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:32.870
<v Speaker 1>God alone knows Christian morality is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>command.</v>

928
00:50:32.871 --> 00:50:37.040
<v Speaker 1>It's the region is transcendental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beyond all criticism at all,</v>

929
00:50:37.041 --> 00:50:39.800
<v Speaker 1>right to criticize or possess as truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>or we have got is truth.</v>

930
00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:42.320
<v Speaker 1>It stands or falls with the belief in </v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

931
00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:45.770
<v Speaker 1>If modern westerners really do believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>they know of their own accord,</v>

932
00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:50.800
<v Speaker 1>intuitively what is good and evil</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they consequently take,</v>

933
00:50:51.201 --> 00:50:54.020
<v Speaker 1>they no longer have need of Christianity</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a guarantee morality.</v>

934
00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:58.700
<v Speaker 1>That is merely the consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ascendancy of Christian evaluation</v>

935
00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:02.543
<v Speaker 1>and an expression of the strength and </v>
<v Speaker 1>depth of this ascendancy so that the </v>

936
00:51:05.061 --> 00:51:05.894
<v Speaker 1>origin of modern morality has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>forgotten and the highly conditional </v>

937
00:51:08.601 --> 00:51:11.750
<v Speaker 1>nature of its way to exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no longer felt on Nietzsche is basically</v>

938
00:51:11.751 --> 00:51:12.584
<v Speaker 1>saying is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you might think that you </v>

939
00:51:16.791 --> 00:51:17.624
<v Speaker 1>can have a morality without a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're talking about crystal </v>

940
00:51:19.761 --> 00:51:21.860
<v Speaker 1>morality in this particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstance,</v>

941
00:51:21.861 --> 00:51:25.340
<v Speaker 1>but it can be any morality is derive </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a system that was predicated on the</v>

942
00:51:25.341 --> 00:51:27.290
<v Speaker 1>notion that there was some </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendental Va.</v>

943
00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:29.053
<v Speaker 1>The fact that you can think that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a morality that will last without </v>

944
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:36.430
<v Speaker 1>that belief is proof of how potent that </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief system is actually means.</v>

945
00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:40.430
<v Speaker 1>It has worked so well and protects you </v>
<v Speaker 1>still so well</v>

946
00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:47.360
<v Speaker 1>that you can be incarcerate Lee </v>
<v Speaker 1>convinced of its lack of necessity.</v>

947
00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:49.023
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I noticed in your footnote on that and </v>

948
00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:52.760
<v Speaker 1>hear that you said you had originally </v>
<v Speaker 1>said been English.</v>

949
00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:53.893
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

950
00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:55.490
<v Speaker 1>what's he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know this,</v>

951
00:51:55.491 --> 00:52:00.491
<v Speaker 1>I know this applies for up to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>character of belief systems in general,</v>

952
00:52:00.681 --> 00:52:01.514
<v Speaker 1>but if he was referring to wasn't or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what's he to the sort of moral </v>

953
00:52:05.211 --> 00:52:07.640
<v Speaker 1>realist philosophers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

954
00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:11.570
<v Speaker 1>To beat that English tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think was about the same time.</v>

955
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:13.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was irritated by attempts to,</v>

956
00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:14.713
<v Speaker 1>to argue that we're already have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rational basis and it was in fact </v>

957
00:52:17.481 --> 00:52:20.150
<v Speaker 1>derived as a consequences of rational </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought and you're going to see it.</v>

958
00:52:20.151 --> 00:52:22.490
<v Speaker 1>It's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then normally that normally that you</v>

959
00:52:22.491 --> 00:52:23.324
<v Speaker 1>can see it and that it's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's how it was originally </v>

960
00:52:25.611 --> 00:52:26.444
<v Speaker 1>derived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that reasonable people </v>

961
00:52:28.161 --> 00:52:28.994
<v Speaker 1>got together and rationally decided that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how they should conduct their </v>

962
00:52:31.881 --> 00:52:32.810
<v Speaker 1>affairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

963
00:52:32.811 --> 00:52:33.351
<v Speaker 1>neat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said,</v>

964
00:52:33.351 --> 00:52:35.150
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't look at the historical record.</v>

965
00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:38.420
<v Speaker 1>You behave first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you figure it out.</v>

966
00:52:38.421 --> 00:52:40.430
<v Speaker 1>And there's huge gaps of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

967
00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:41.373
<v Speaker 1>of tens of centuries between figuring </v>
<v Speaker 1>out how to behave or between acting and </v>

968
00:52:45.561 --> 00:52:48.110
<v Speaker 1>then later being able to say how it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have.</v>

969
00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:49.460
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

970
00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:52.730
<v Speaker 1>he thought that the English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're putting the cart before the horse</v>

971
00:52:54.730 --> 00:52:59.600
<v Speaker 1>in the man's man having no vision for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

972
00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:01.850
<v Speaker 1>for the length of historical development</v>

973
00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:03.393
<v Speaker 3>so I can not happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you make declarative </v>

974
00:53:04.731 --> 00:53:06.740
<v Speaker 3>representations of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then for instance,</v>

975
00:53:06.741 --> 00:53:07.574
<v Speaker 3>when a new person and you teach them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>declared what you teach them verbal </v>

976
00:53:10.761 --> 00:53:15.560
<v Speaker 3>stories about the religion for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does that get into their behavior?</v>

977
00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:18.620
<v Speaker 3>I need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that then by listening to the stories</v>

978
00:53:18.621 --> 00:53:19.454
<v Speaker 3>about that they actually learn the </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior of the procedural level of how </v>

979
00:53:22.071 --> 00:53:24.080
<v Speaker 3>to ask and without believing.</v>

980
00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a good question to me.</v>

981
00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly what impact,</v>

982
00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:34.500
<v Speaker 1>watching stories that has on behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

983
00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:35.753
<v Speaker 1>I think really what watch the stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably does too is reconfigure your </v>

984
00:53:39.331 --> 00:53:43.320
<v Speaker 1>conceptions of the present and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future so that the motivation,</v>

985
00:53:43.321 --> 00:53:47.460
<v Speaker 1>the significance of things shifts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has a consequence on your behavior.</v>

986
00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:50.820
<v Speaker 1>Although,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you also have to realize that,</v>

987
00:53:50.821 --> 00:53:51.654
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies and books and so on portray </v>

988
00:53:53.461 --> 00:53:57.360
<v Speaker 1>heroes and heroes are more wireless for </v>
<v Speaker 1>emulation.</v>

989
00:53:57.450 --> 00:54:00.780
<v Speaker 1>And a model for emulation is essentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone to be annotated.</v>

990
00:54:00.781 --> 00:54:01.614
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think that you can write off </v>
<v Speaker 1>the direct impact of the story on </v>

991
00:54:05.221 --> 00:54:07.020
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when kids play,</v>

992
00:54:07.021 --> 00:54:08.100
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they,</v>

993
00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:10.170
<v Speaker 1>when they pretend that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

994
00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:14.040
<v Speaker 1>what they're basically doing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>embodying and imaginative representation</v>

995
00:54:14.041 --> 00:54:16.650
<v Speaker 1>of a pattern of action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what that is,</v>

996
00:54:16.651 --> 00:54:18.630
<v Speaker 1>what their play does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in part.</v>

997
00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:21.960
<v Speaker 1>So there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some direct effect,</v>

998
00:54:21.961 --> 00:54:26.961
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting this neat,</v>

999
00:54:31.501 --> 00:54:32.041
<v Speaker 1>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1000
00:54:32.041 --> 00:54:35.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have no rational reason for having a,</v>

1001
00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:39.300
<v Speaker 1>for continuing to behave in the way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we behaved in the past,</v>

1002
00:54:39.330 --> 00:54:40.163
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Judeo Christian presuppositions in </v>

1003
00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:46.590
<v Speaker 1>European society because we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in the funds miracle.</v>

1004
00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:48.313
<v Speaker 1>You don't believe in the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>premises of the system by which those </v>

1005
00:54:50.911 --> 00:54:52.680
<v Speaker 1>moral rules we're generating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can say,</v>

1006
00:54:52.681 --> 00:54:53.514
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity Judeo Christianity is a </v>

1007
00:54:55.471 --> 00:55:00.471
<v Speaker 1>tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tree of recent positions.</v>

1008
00:55:01.381 --> 00:55:04.530
<v Speaker 1>Then the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we live out here in the branches and</v>

1009
00:55:04.531 --> 00:55:07.560
<v Speaker 1>the most fundamental presupposition is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is a god.</v>

1010
00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:11.370
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you break the tree at that point,</v>

1011
00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:14.530
<v Speaker 1>then the whole tree is dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just don't know it.</v>

1012
00:55:14.531 --> 00:55:16.770
<v Speaker 1>It might take a long time to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she would say,</v>

1013
00:55:16.771 --> 00:55:18.450
<v Speaker 1>and this was basically his theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1014
00:55:18.690 --> 00:55:19.523
<v Speaker 1>that's why people in the 20th century </v>
<v Speaker 1>were so unbelievably susceptible to </v>

1015
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:24.503
<v Speaker 1>rationally ideologies like fascism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>communism rationally described </v>

1016
00:55:27.421 --> 00:55:31.110
<v Speaker 1>ideologists because well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1017
00:55:31.830 --> 00:55:32.663
<v Speaker 1>because their foundation can be made </v>
<v Speaker 1>very unstable by destruction at this </v>

1018
00:55:38.221 --> 00:55:41.060
<v Speaker 1>point in their presumption hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

1019
00:55:41.061 --> 00:55:41.894
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't an inhibitory network in a </v>

1020
00:55:43.501 --> 00:55:45.660
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think of it as a methodology for</v>

1021
00:55:45.661 --> 00:55:48.030
<v Speaker 1>keeping anxiety under control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When this goes well,</v>

1022
00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:52.830
<v Speaker 1>that whole thing is cast into doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The the grand inquisitor,</v>

1023
00:55:55.510 --> 00:56:00.060
<v Speaker 1>the trunk of the tree was not god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then it had been captured.</v>

1024
00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:04.320
<v Speaker 1>The grand inquisitor is planning</v>
<v Speaker 1>foundation of the society.</v>

1025
00:56:04.330 --> 00:56:05.163
<v Speaker 1>Had been captured by the RG,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious and spiritual aspect that </v>

1026
00:56:12.121 --> 00:56:14.590
<v Speaker 1>became be potentiated just undermine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1027
00:56:14.591 --> 00:56:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1028
00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:16.350
<v Speaker 1>That's fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1029
00:56:16.351 --> 00:56:17.880
<v Speaker 1>that's something that we'll have to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1030
00:56:18.330 --> 00:56:19.163
<v Speaker 1>Talk about.</v>

1031
00:56:21.350 --> 00:56:22.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1032
00:56:22.651 --> 00:56:24.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to answer that right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

1033
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.720
<v Speaker 2>will just answer briefly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can say,</v>

1034
00:56:25.721 --> 00:56:26.554
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the belief in God is the belief in two </v>

1035
00:56:27.371 --> 00:56:29.080
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is authority,</v>

1036
00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:34.740
<v Speaker 2>and the other is process of adaptation </v>
<v Speaker 2>is simply and the priests,</v>

1037
00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:39.430
<v Speaker 2>to the degree that the priest and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dostoevsky story encapsulate this,</v>

1038
00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:43.000
<v Speaker 2>this was theoretically made unnecessary </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1039
00:56:43.001 --> 00:56:45.280
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll tell you what the world is like.</v>

1040
00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:49.330
<v Speaker 2>That's all you need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you remember Dostoevsky story to the</v>

1041
00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:50.163
<v Speaker 2>Grand Inquisitor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he met Christ out the back door because </v>

1042
00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:53.830
<v Speaker 2>that's why that's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Story means standing,</v>

1043
00:56:53.831 --> 00:56:54.664
<v Speaker 2>but does it as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though the grand inquisitor is a </v>

1044
00:56:56.981 --> 00:56:58.240
<v Speaker 2>fascist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally,</v>

1045
00:56:58.241 --> 00:56:59.380
<v Speaker 2>it's representative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1046
00:56:59.381 --> 00:57:00.214
<v Speaker 2>in that story of the Catholic church,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tremendously potent authoritarian </v>

1047
00:57:02.951 --> 00:57:07.951
<v Speaker 2>structure with sufficient flexibility to</v>
<v Speaker 2>allow them the active process,</v>

1048
00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:12.160
<v Speaker 2>some small measure of freedom in which </v>
<v Speaker 2>to operate.</v>

1049
00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:16.190
<v Speaker 2>What'd you say?</v>

1050
00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:18.863
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it goes to ask you a story that the </v>

1051
00:57:19.741 --> 00:57:22.230
<v Speaker 1>process is Christ in the grand </v>
<v Speaker 1>inquisitor.</v>

1052
00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:24.090
<v Speaker 1>He's the act of spiritual.</v>

1053
00:57:27.930 --> 00:57:28.763
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1054
00:57:29.350 --> 00:57:30.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the act of spiritual process as </v>

1055
00:57:31.461 --> 00:57:33.470
<v Speaker 1>opposed to the static structure of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>church,</v>

1056
00:57:33.471 --> 00:57:35.770
<v Speaker 1>which is basically once in government </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

1057
00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:38.060
<v Speaker 1>it's trying to make things or disorders.</v>

1058
00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:39.980
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1059
00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:43.603
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1060
00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:48.180
<v Speaker 1>many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as I'm concerned,</v>

1061
00:57:48.181 --> 00:57:49.014
<v Speaker 1>we have a split in the recognizance </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and the split is between </v>

1062
00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:54.173
<v Speaker 1>what we assume to be true from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific perspective and how we're </v>

1063
00:57:57.001 --> 00:57:57.834
<v Speaker 1>willing to govern our actions because </v>
<v Speaker 1>their actions are still governed by </v>

1064
00:57:59.821 --> 00:58:03.030
<v Speaker 1>mythological presuppositions that we no </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer presumed to be valid.</v>

1065
00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:06.090
<v Speaker 1>We're still learning to accept them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we also know that they're useful.</v>

1066
00:58:06.091 --> 00:58:08.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1067
00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:12.240
<v Speaker 1>Western democracy is predicated on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>notion of the natural right,</v>

1068
00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:14.510
<v Speaker 1>and the natural writers a transcendental</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

1069
00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:16.410
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's been able to pin the damn thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

1070
00:58:16.411 --> 00:58:18.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we found is we can't do without it.</v>

1071
00:58:18.830 --> 00:58:20.760
<v Speaker 1>I know at the basis of natural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1072
00:58:20.761 --> 00:58:21.594
<v Speaker 1>is the idea that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about you that's more </v>

1073
00:58:24.151 --> 00:58:27.380
<v Speaker 1>or less incomprehensible that I have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have respect for.</v>

1074
00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:30.210
<v Speaker 1>Although I can't categorize it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't describe it rationally.</v>

1075
00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:34.980
<v Speaker 1>If I act like it's not there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things immediately go very badly astray.</v>

1076
00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:37.620
<v Speaker 1>The notion of natural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean people have tried to come up with</v>

1077
00:58:37.650 --> 00:58:40.080
<v Speaker 1>rational explanations for the natural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1078
00:58:40.081 --> 00:58:44.370
<v Speaker 1>But that's foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's foolish because like every system</v>

1079
00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:47.340
<v Speaker 1>at the base of every system is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition.</v>

1080
00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:51.510
<v Speaker 1>That's because say well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's because you don't know everything</v>

1081
00:58:51.850 --> 00:58:53.410
<v Speaker 1>and because you don't know everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that means,</v>

1082
00:58:53.411 --> 00:58:56.520
<v Speaker 1>but whatever you do has to be predicated</v>
<v Speaker 1>on some preset positions,</v>

1083
00:58:56.521 --> 00:58:56.851
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1084
00:58:56.851 --> 00:58:57.684
<v Speaker 1>you have to take a leap of faith at some</v>
<v Speaker 1>point that the presupposition of the </v>

1085
00:59:00.901 --> 00:59:05.901
<v Speaker 1>national right tree is that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something valuable about the individual</v>

1086
00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:11.160
<v Speaker 1>and it's once you accept that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like a rule of the game,</v>

1087
00:59:11.161 --> 00:59:13.890
<v Speaker 1>we'll just play that game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're valuable and I'm valuable.</v>

1088
00:59:13.891 --> 00:59:16.170
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Given that premise,</v>

1089
00:59:16.171 --> 00:59:18.060
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole bunch of necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusions.</v>

1090
00:59:18.061 --> 00:59:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Those are our main goal of the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>body of our natural rights.</v>

1091
00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:23.720
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1092
00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:27.710
<v Speaker 1>once you've accepted this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can rationally derive those,</v>

1093
00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:29.713
<v Speaker 1>but you can't provide rational </v>
<v Speaker 1>underpinnings for that because that's </v>

1094
00:59:32.241 --> 00:59:35.810
<v Speaker 1>just in the sense it's in a sense it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just an arbitrary decision.</v>

1095
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:39.050
<v Speaker 1>It's just a game rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you want to play the game.</v>

1096
00:59:39.350 --> 00:59:40.770
<v Speaker 1>If you want to play this particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>

1097
00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:41.633
<v Speaker 1>you have to accept that rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's arbitrary now </v>

1098
00:59:43.290 --> 00:59:44.123
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a real reason why that </v>

1099
00:59:45.201 --> 00:59:47.480
<v Speaker 1>particular phenomenon emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's fundamental.</v>

1100
00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:49.910
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing I want to do in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this course.</v>

1101
00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Sorry I jump all over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what that's like.</v>

1102
00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:59.600
<v Speaker 1>I want to show you that this precept </v>
<v Speaker 1>position is not arbitrary,</v>

1103
01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:00.943
<v Speaker 1>that it's a necessary emergent property </v>
<v Speaker 1>of successful patterns of social </v>

1104
01:00:04.071 --> 01:00:06.090
<v Speaker 1>interaction and then even if you wipe it</v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

1105
01:00:06.091 --> 01:00:06.924
<v Speaker 1>he would pop back up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I you say say that emphasis on </v>

1106
01:00:09.591 --> 01:00:12.770
<v Speaker 1>individual work is the hallmark of any </v>
<v Speaker 1>society bedside,</v>

1107
01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:16.970
<v Speaker 1>properly functioning and stable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stable in the long term and also capable</v>

1108
01:00:16.971 --> 01:00:20.630
<v Speaker 1>of updating itself when it's necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it'll just pop up over and over</v>

1109
01:00:20.631 --> 01:00:21.464
<v Speaker 1>and over again of its own accord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that'll help us get away from the </v>

1110
01:00:25.701 --> 01:00:28.550
<v Speaker 1>idea that morality is arbitrary in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

1111
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:30.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old argument system,</v>

1112
01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:32.180
<v Speaker 1>no matter what moral rule you can think </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1113
01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:33.043
<v Speaker 1>there's some society somewhere on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet who does exactly the opposite </v>

1114
01:00:35.631 --> 01:00:36.464
<v Speaker 1>thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>equal have used that sort of </v>

1115
01:00:38.841 --> 01:00:39.674
<v Speaker 1>argumentation to too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that sort of evidence to argue that </v>

1116
01:00:42.291 --> 01:00:43.124
<v Speaker 1>there's no such thing as as </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendental morality that that's a </v>

1117
01:00:46.281 --> 01:00:47.270
<v Speaker 1>useless pursuit.</v>

1118
01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:50.900
<v Speaker 1>Nature's point was people say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1119
01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:52.693
<v Speaker 1>they're willing also to undermine their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own belief systems by pointing out </v>

1120
01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:56.890
<v Speaker 1>obvious things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

1121
01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:58.700
<v Speaker 1>if you shoot a rocket far enough open </v>
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>

1122
01:00:58.701 --> 01:01:01.430
<v Speaker 1>you open going to find having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so God's not out there.</v>

1123
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:05.960
<v Speaker 1>We still act like our moral systems have</v>
<v Speaker 1>value in their useful and it really does</v>

1124
01:01:05.961 --> 01:01:07.990
<v Speaker 1>appear that acting that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works.</v>

1125
01:01:07.991 --> 01:01:09.670
<v Speaker 1>So then you have to wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it works.</v>

1126
01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:12.320
<v Speaker 1>You know what's at the basis of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's really interesting,</v>

1127
01:01:12.321 --> 01:01:14.180
<v Speaker 1>like when I first started thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>these ideas,</v>

1128
01:01:14.430 --> 01:01:15.263
<v Speaker 1>there was still a lot of debate on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world scene in the sense of how it is </v>

1129
01:01:17.721 --> 01:01:19.250
<v Speaker 1>that we should conduct two affairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1130
01:01:19.251 --> 01:01:22.790
<v Speaker 1>at the very least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two major sources of,</v>

1131
01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:27.410
<v Speaker 1>or two major bodies of ideas that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1132
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:31.070
<v Speaker 1>in like deadlocked competition and one </v>
<v Speaker 1>was authoritarian,</v>

1133
01:01:31.071 --> 01:01:33.860
<v Speaker 1>more or less the communists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the communist bloc.</v>

1134
01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:34.773
<v Speaker 1>They had the way of their head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their notions of how to configure the </v>

1135
01:01:36.321 --> 01:01:37.154
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there was our side and you </v>

1136
01:01:38.561 --> 01:01:39.394
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were basically at each other's </v>

1137
01:01:39.951 --> 01:01:40.784
<v Speaker 1>throats and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was very disturbing to me at the </v>

1138
01:01:42.471 --> 01:01:46.460
<v Speaker 1>time that have sort of all fallen apart </v>
<v Speaker 1>now with any luck.</v>

1139
01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:47.603
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does seem that whatever it is that </v>

1140
01:01:49.671 --> 01:01:50.504
<v Speaker 1>we're doing in the West seems to work at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least better than anything else anybody </v>

1141
01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:54.493
<v Speaker 1>can come up with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Nietzsche was already in this </v>

1142
01:01:58.251 --> 01:02:01.020
<v Speaker 1>morality has tried sitting there </v>
<v Speaker 1>origins,</v>

1143
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:03.940
<v Speaker 1>you can't have it if you don't accept </v>
<v Speaker 1>the transcendental origins,</v>

1144
01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:04.783
<v Speaker 1>you might think you have it past that </v>
<v Speaker 1>just proves that you don't understand </v>

1145
01:02:06.981 --> 01:02:07.814
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1146
01:02:08.310 --> 01:02:12.020
<v Speaker 1>it's also the case that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this morality,</v>

1147
01:02:12.021 --> 01:02:15.110
<v Speaker 1>which has transcended dental origins </v>
<v Speaker 1>works</v>

1148
01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:19.430
<v Speaker 1>and it also seems to be the case that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's preset positions.</v>

1149
01:02:34.270 --> 01:02:35.103
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1150
01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:46.340
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to borrow some time for </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion.</v>

1151
01:02:46.341 --> 01:02:47.180
<v Speaker 1>So I just want to</v>

1152
01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:59.600
<v Speaker 2>covered too</v>
<v Speaker 2>slow.</v>

1153
01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:16.880
<v Speaker 1>Is Concerned with morality is how to act</v>

1154
01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:22.740
<v Speaker 1>neat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pointed out a hundred years ago that</v>

1155
01:03:22.741 --> 01:03:23.574
<v Speaker 1>Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that there was morality was a </v>

1156
01:03:25.231 --> 01:03:27.690
<v Speaker 1>much more difficult problem to solve </v>
<v Speaker 1>then which,</v>

1157
01:03:27.810 --> 01:03:28.643
<v Speaker 1>and he was right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess in a sense the fact that there </v>

1158
01:03:34.351 --> 01:03:36.810
<v Speaker 1>is morality is the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the questions that we're going to</v>

1159
01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:39.210
<v Speaker 1>give us facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is there a morality?</v>

1160
01:03:40.290 --> 01:03:43.740
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean that there is morality</v>
<v Speaker 1>and given that there is morality,</v>

1161
01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:47.350
<v Speaker 1>is there anything that can be said about</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's universal across morality?</v>

1162
01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:48.200
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

1163
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:49.063
<v Speaker 1>that's another thing is we know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>within a different moral systems there </v>

1164
01:03:51.901 --> 01:03:54.810
<v Speaker 1>are differences of opinion about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be done.</v>

1165
01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:55.793
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>across moral system there are </v>

1166
01:03:56.941 --> 01:03:58.580
<v Speaker 1>differences of opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if any,</v>

1167
01:03:58.581 --> 01:04:02.070
<v Speaker 1>about what should be done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that there are moral system</v>

1168
01:04:02.071 --> 01:04:04.190
<v Speaker 1>seems to be a universal of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

1169
01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:05.083
<v Speaker 1>So there's something universal in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>domain of morality at the level of </v>

1170
01:04:07.951 --> 01:04:11.970
<v Speaker 1>analysis that says that every human </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture has a morality on.</v>

1171
01:04:11.970 --> 01:04:12.803
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of interested in looking at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>metal structure of the morality is to </v>

1172
01:04:16.411 --> 01:04:17.244
<v Speaker 1>see if there's anything that we could </v>
<v Speaker 1>pull out that is common to the ball </v>

1173
01:04:19.201 --> 01:04:23.490
<v Speaker 1>because that would give us some idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what morality is and if we want to</v>

1174
01:04:23.491 --> 01:04:24.324
<v Speaker 1>come to agreement in the long term about</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it is that we should conduct our </v>

1175
01:04:26.881 --> 01:04:27.714
<v Speaker 1>affairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in part lesson or propensity to </v>

1176
01:04:29.551 --> 01:04:32.520
<v Speaker 1>engage the social conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me to be reasonable,</v>

1177
01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:33.533
<v Speaker 1>to be useful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to apprehend rationally what </v>

1178
01:04:36.091 --> 01:04:41.091
<v Speaker 1>the basis for the fact of morality yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the methodology here is Bob,</v>

1179
01:04:41.131 --> 01:04:43.740
<v Speaker 1>we're going to look at some neuro </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology because I'm interested in,</v>

1180
01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:48.330
<v Speaker 1>in what modern research has to say about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way we regulate our emotions.</v>

1181
01:04:48.331 --> 01:04:50.310
<v Speaker 1>So that's one domain of evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to cover.</v>

1182
01:04:50.311 --> 01:04:53.820
<v Speaker 1>The other domain is comparative </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythologies strap.</v>

1183
01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:54.953
<v Speaker 1>We're going to look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>mythologies from different cultures and </v>

1184
01:04:58.681 --> 01:04:59.514
<v Speaker 1>see if we can extract from them what </v>
<v Speaker 1>their essential structure is to see if </v>

1185
01:05:03.001 --> 01:05:04.980
<v Speaker 1>there are any commonalities and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

1186
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:09.480
<v Speaker 1>So that's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was basically the notion.</v>

1187
01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:10.893
<v Speaker 1>Say the basic issue here is how can the </v>
<v Speaker 1>current state of experience be </v>

1188
01:05:15.481 --> 01:05:18.340
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized in abstraction regards to</v>
<v Speaker 1>its meeting?</v>

1189
01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:19.780
<v Speaker 1>It's just the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1190
01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:20.800
<v Speaker 1>that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what,</v>

1191
01:05:20.801 --> 01:05:21.634
<v Speaker 1>knowing how to act meet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the significance of the </v>

1192
01:05:25.331 --> 01:05:26.164
<v Speaker 1>phenomena that you currently apprehend?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say meaning means implication for </v>

1193
01:05:29.651 --> 01:05:31.810
<v Speaker 1>behavioral output logically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

1194
01:05:31.811 --> 01:05:35.260
<v Speaker 1>myth presents information relevant to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most fundamental moral problems,</v>

1195
01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:36.273
<v Speaker 1>which is what should be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the question that stories are </v>

1196
01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:39.513
<v Speaker 1>trying to answer how you should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it that you should act but </v>

1197
01:05:43.391 --> 01:05:46.330
<v Speaker 1>desirable future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the object of what should be,</v>

1198
01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:47.980
<v Speaker 1>can only be conceptualized,</v>

1199
01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.553
<v Speaker 2>sorry</v>

1200
01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:07.630
<v Speaker 1>can only be conceptualized in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to the present,</v>

1201
01:06:07.631 --> 01:06:10.780
<v Speaker 1>which serves at least as a necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>point of contrast and comparison,</v>

1202
01:06:10.781 --> 01:06:12.010
<v Speaker 1>which is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1203
01:06:12.011 --> 01:06:14.560
<v Speaker 1>if you think that things should be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular way,</v>

1204
01:06:14.561 --> 01:06:15.394
<v Speaker 1>you're always conceiving that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to the way that you </v>

1205
01:06:17.051 --> 01:06:19.690
<v Speaker 1>conceive of them being now and those two</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1206
01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:23.990
<v Speaker 1>What's this kind of a peculiar aspect of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this form of cognition,</v>

1207
01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:24.893
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You evaluate your presence state in </v>

1208
01:06:27.431 --> 01:06:28.264
<v Speaker 1>terms of your ideal future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also evaluate your ideal future </v>

1209
01:06:31.331 --> 01:06:32.164
<v Speaker 1>in terms of your presence state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a constant interaction going </v>

1210
01:06:34.391 --> 01:06:35.224
<v Speaker 1>between the two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why poverty for example is </v>

1211
01:06:38.711 --> 01:06:42.940
<v Speaker 1>relative and I think it's relative in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of its socioeconomic effects.</v>

1212
01:06:42.941 --> 01:06:43.774
<v Speaker 1>It's where you are in the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy to determines the effect of </v>

1213
01:06:46.091 --> 01:06:49.300
<v Speaker 1>socioeconomic status rather than your </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute level of material.</v>

1214
01:06:49.301 --> 01:06:50.134
<v Speaker 1>Wellbeing is something that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>really worth considering for a </v>

1215
01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:54.850
<v Speaker 1>psychologist when they talk about ses </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

1216
01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:56.313
<v Speaker 1>well to give you one example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the black community in the u s </v>

1217
01:06:58.811 --> 01:07:03.811
<v Speaker 1>which is a population that's frequently </v>
<v Speaker 1>studied with regards to the consequences</v>

1218
01:07:04.601 --> 01:07:05.434
<v Speaker 1>of low socioeconomic status as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>population group constitutes the 13th </v>

1219
01:07:09.851 --> 01:07:11.590
<v Speaker 1>most wealthy nation on the planet.</v>

1220
01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.113
<v Speaker 1>You can also sign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's kind of interesting when </v>

1221
01:07:14.291 --> 01:07:16.180
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking about things in absolute</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms.</v>

1222
01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:20.110
<v Speaker 1>It's also the case that even the poorest</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in North American society,</v>

1223
01:07:20.111 --> 01:07:20.944
<v Speaker 1>you know with exception of people who've</v>
<v Speaker 1>fallen completely out of the world have </v>

1224
01:07:24.191 --> 01:07:28.410
<v Speaker 1>access to two technologies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The 200 years ago were non existence.</v>

1225
01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:29.253
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not talking about computers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about like heat and running </v>

1226
01:07:31.091 --> 01:07:33.040
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So poverty,</v>

1227
01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:36.160
<v Speaker 1>that's just one example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poverty is where are,</v>

1228
01:07:36.161 --> 01:07:39.880
<v Speaker 1>you are construe with respect to where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be.</v>

1229
01:07:40.210 --> 01:07:42.910
<v Speaker 1>And there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously there's some level of absolute</v>

1230
01:07:42.911 --> 01:07:43.744
<v Speaker 1>poverty too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you don't get enough to eat </v>

1231
01:07:45.010 --> 01:07:45.843
<v Speaker 1>well that brings everything to a halt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But point is is that you can't conceive </v>

1232
01:07:48.971 --> 01:07:49.804
<v Speaker 1>of where you are from the effect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective without also conceiving of </v>

1233
01:07:52.511 --> 01:07:54.530
<v Speaker 1>where you could be in vice versa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1234
01:07:56.250 --> 01:07:59.260
<v Speaker 1>mass to answer the following stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

1235
01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:00.273
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the nature of the current state </v>

1236
01:08:01.401 --> 01:08:03.670
<v Speaker 1>of experience from the motivational </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

1237
01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:08.530
<v Speaker 1>what should be to what Angie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd be moving and how can we get there?</v>

1238
01:08:08.830 --> 01:08:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

1239
01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:11.410
<v Speaker 1>I showed you last week is faith.</v>

1240
01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a story as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell.</v>

1241
01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:24.420
<v Speaker 1>Now you want to use your imagination for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a minute saying his dad snores.</v>

1242
01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Just the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also a kingdom.</v>

1243
01:08:27.850 --> 01:08:28.683
<v Speaker 1>What a ridiculous thing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could imagine that there's a castle </v>

1244
01:08:33.681 --> 01:08:37.940
<v Speaker 1>wall around that and that what surrounds</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is hostile territory.</v>

1245
01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:40.760
<v Speaker 1>So that can be viewed as sometimes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythologies.</v>

1246
01:08:40.761 --> 01:08:41.594
<v Speaker 1>It's viewed as a notion might be one way</v>
<v Speaker 1>of looking at it might be viewed as </v>

1247
01:08:44.211 --> 01:08:45.044
<v Speaker 1>barbarian lands are dark forces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is is the out heres where </v>

1248
01:08:48.051 --> 01:08:48.884
<v Speaker 1>things that you can't predict take place</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody who shares your story is </v>

1249
01:08:52.731 --> 01:08:54.470
<v Speaker 1>predictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They live inside your kingdom,</v>

1250
01:08:54.890 --> 01:08:57.760
<v Speaker 1>everybody outside is contaminated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos basically.</v>

1251
01:08:57.761 --> 01:08:58.594
<v Speaker 1>But you see why that is is even in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>class is we have a vision of where the </v>

1252
01:09:01.641 --> 01:09:04.340
<v Speaker 1>class is going to go both over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>course of the whole semester.</v>

1253
01:09:04.341 --> 01:09:05.360
<v Speaker 1>And just today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1254
01:09:05.530 --> 01:09:08.900
<v Speaker 1>we have a vision of how it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress and how we can,</v>

1255
01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:09.793
<v Speaker 1>how we can save ourselves in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to all the others in this </v>

1256
01:09:11.601 --> 01:09:14.660
<v Speaker 1>class and exactly what's going to happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what the plan is.</v>

1257
01:09:14.661 --> 01:09:15.494
<v Speaker 1>And so as far as we're concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we compose a unit and we're a unit </v>

1258
01:09:18.651 --> 01:09:19.484
<v Speaker 1>because we can predict all each other's </v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors and we can predict each </v>

1259
01:09:21.531 --> 01:09:23.420
<v Speaker 1>other's behaviors cause we all have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same story.</v>

1260
01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:25.640
<v Speaker 1>That's what the story is.</v>

1261
01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:29.900
<v Speaker 1>How does this tie in with mythology?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one thing,</v>

1262
01:09:29.901 --> 01:09:30.734
<v Speaker 1>I haven't said anything about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do I think this all has anything to </v>

1263
01:09:33.531 --> 01:09:36.440
<v Speaker 1>do with mythology?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a glaring question.</v>

1264
01:09:36.890 --> 01:09:38.540
<v Speaker 1>That's why you look at the Christian </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint.</v>

1265
01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:41.240
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say map it onto the structure.</v>

1266
01:09:41.241 --> 01:09:42.074
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity gives you a picture of </v>

1267
01:09:43.161 --> 01:09:43.994
<v Speaker 1>Matt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what miss dew and Christianity </v>

1268
01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:48.193
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1269
01:09:48.830 --> 01:09:53.830
<v Speaker 1>what is man</v>
<v Speaker 1>contaminated by original sin?</v>

1270
01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:57.823
<v Speaker 1>That's a hereditary retained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have it whether you deserve it or </v>

1271
01:10:01.131 --> 01:10:02.060
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's they're</v>

1272
01:10:05.090 --> 01:10:09.860
<v Speaker 1>in desperate need of redemption and </v>
<v Speaker 1>living in a sea of</v>

1273
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:13.430
<v Speaker 1>chaos and misery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>

1274
01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:17.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a pretty negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a pretty negative summary,</v>

1275
01:10:17.871 --> 01:10:20.180
<v Speaker 1>but it'll do for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the present purposes,</v>

1276
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:23.930
<v Speaker 1>that's our presence state like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we don't want to trivialize this,</v>

1277
01:10:23.931 --> 01:10:25.610
<v Speaker 1>that the Christian perspective basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1278
01:10:25.611 --> 01:10:26.444
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something fundamentally screwed </v>

1279
01:10:27.771 --> 01:10:28.604
<v Speaker 1>up with the world.</v>

1280
01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:31.220
<v Speaker 1>Human beings do not fit here really </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

1281
01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:32.060
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

1282
01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:34.670
<v Speaker 1>we pose a constant question to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>

1283
01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:36.950
<v Speaker 1>We don't understand our place in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of things.</v>

1284
01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:39.050
<v Speaker 1>We're always doing things that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

1285
01:10:40.010 --> 01:10:42.620
<v Speaker 1>There's a central mystery here that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't solved.</v>

1286
01:10:43.050 --> 01:10:43.883
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a trivial conception and </v>

1287
01:10:45.361 --> 01:10:46.194
<v Speaker 1>people laugh about original sin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What sort of weird consent concept of </v>

1288
01:10:49.981 --> 01:10:50.721
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this says,</v>

1289
01:10:50.721 --> 01:10:51.554
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about human beings </v>

1290
01:10:52.191 --> 01:10:53.840
<v Speaker 1>that we don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes them evil.</v>

1291
01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:54.913
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't just lack of socioeconomic goods </v>

1292
01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:06.350
<v Speaker 1>mass best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then there's also some image of the</v>

1293
01:11:06.351 --> 01:11:11.180
<v Speaker 1>ideal future and that's paradise</v>
<v Speaker 1>or heaven</v>

1294
01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:13.793
<v Speaker 1>or even the Kingdom of Heaven on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be something that's </v>

1295
01:11:17.011 --> 01:11:19.560
<v Speaker 1>purely spiritual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual.</v>

1296
01:11:19.561 --> 01:11:20.394
<v Speaker 1>That means in a sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means my domain of the imagination </v>

1297
01:11:24.781 --> 01:11:25.620
<v Speaker 1>and you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1298
01:11:26.490 --> 01:11:28.920
<v Speaker 1>paradise is the archetype of the ideal </v>
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>

1299
01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:29.813
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that whenever you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>committing an action of any sort to act </v>

1300
01:11:33.481 --> 01:11:36.300
<v Speaker 1>means to have a prayer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means to say that you are here and</v>

1301
01:11:36.301 --> 01:11:37.134
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go here and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral routines to bring that </v>

1302
01:11:39.781 --> 01:11:44.130
<v Speaker 1>transformation about whatever act you </v>
<v Speaker 1>undertake has that structure.</v>

1303
01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:44.993
<v Speaker 1>So you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1304
01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:45.953
<v Speaker 1>the collection of acts as a whole has </v>
<v Speaker 1>that structure to act is to adopt the </v>

1305
01:11:49.301 --> 01:11:50.610
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say,</v>

1306
01:11:50.611 --> 01:11:51.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could</v>

1307
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:57.240
<v Speaker 1>abstract out from all of the particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>notions of your ideal future.</v>

1308
01:11:57.420 --> 01:12:00.330
<v Speaker 1>Some abstract that met a notion of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal.</v>

1309
01:12:00.690 --> 01:12:01.523
<v Speaker 1>And that would be paradox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why you can see how these </v>

1310
01:12:04.291 --> 01:12:09.150
<v Speaker 1>myths sorts in fills the notion that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is some sort of ideal,</v>

1311
01:12:09.151 --> 01:12:09.984
<v Speaker 1>let something that's inherent to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can build your ideal well just </v>

1312
01:12:14.341 --> 01:12:17.520
<v Speaker 1>by imagining what the best of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible situations could be.</v>

1313
01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:19.920
<v Speaker 1>And Christian morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1314
01:12:20.190 --> 01:12:21.023
<v Speaker 1>is the acceptable procedures by which </v>
<v Speaker 1>the unbearable present can be </v>

1315
01:12:25.561 --> 01:12:28.350
<v Speaker 1>transformed into the ideal future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you share that well,</v>

1316
01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:32.590
<v Speaker 1>then you're part of a community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a community means that you're walled</v>

1317
01:12:32.591 --> 01:12:33.424
<v Speaker 1>in with all these other people who think</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you and all the barbarian hordes </v>

1318
01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:38.250
<v Speaker 1>and the discord and a male companion.</v>

1319
01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:41.460
<v Speaker 1>The unpredictability that's outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

1320
01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:44.420
<v Speaker 1>So that's a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while that was,</v>

1321
01:12:44.590 --> 01:12:45.810
<v Speaker 1>that was a religious story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

1322
01:12:45.811 --> 01:12:47.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the communist stories like that,</v>

1323
01:12:49.710 --> 01:12:52.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's pretty outdated story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kindness in many ways.</v>

1324
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:57.090
<v Speaker 1>The current situation is characterized </v>
<v Speaker 1>by a socioeconomic inequality.</v>

1325
01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:00.860
<v Speaker 1>That's a consequence of class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The class struggle that we,</v>

1326
01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:02.043
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can erect to heaven on earth by </v>

1327
01:13:03.781 --> 01:13:06.690
<v Speaker 1>distributing income and opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 1>equitably.</v>

1328
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:09.450
<v Speaker 1>We have to undergo a period of </v>
<v Speaker 1>intermediate and chaos,</v>

1329
01:13:09.451 --> 01:13:11.190
<v Speaker 1>which we'll get to later to bring that </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

1330
01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:12.540
<v Speaker 1>etc. Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1331
01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:13.673
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in one of the things that's happened to </v>

1332
01:13:14.191 --> 01:13:14.941
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

1333
01:13:14.941 --> 01:13:18.840
<v Speaker 1>many European communities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is an appalling thing,</v>

1334
01:13:18.841 --> 01:13:21.650
<v Speaker 1>is that when their religious structures </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapsed,</v>

1335
01:13:21.651 --> 01:13:22.484
<v Speaker 1>the first thing they do is replace them </v>
<v Speaker 1>with like far more idiotic political </v>

1336
01:13:25.981 --> 01:13:27.600
<v Speaker 1>utopias.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as far as,</v>

1337
01:13:27.601 --> 01:13:29.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean this has happened in many places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened in Russia.</v>

1338
01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:32.970
<v Speaker 1>How in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it happened to China,</v>

1339
01:13:33.630 --> 01:13:36.870
<v Speaker 1>I think it's happening pullback as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a matter of fact as well.</v>

1340
01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:39.953
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I think when it came to </v>

1341
01:13:41.701 --> 01:13:43.680
<v Speaker 1>quality last Roman Catholicism and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1342
01:13:43.681 --> 01:13:44.514
<v Speaker 1>the late fifties and now we think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>if the political situation was just </v>

1343
01:13:47.341 --> 01:13:48.174
<v Speaker 1>transformed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the world would turn into a </v>

1344
01:13:49.351 --> 01:13:50.184
<v Speaker 1>utopian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens when people lose </v>

1345
01:13:52.081 --> 01:13:54.180
<v Speaker 1>their religious beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the first thing.</v>

1346
01:13:54.181 --> 01:13:56.640
<v Speaker 1>They do use these cause there's a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>hole there.</v>

1347
01:13:56.641 --> 01:13:59.100
<v Speaker 1>But okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the,</v>

1348
01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:01.770
<v Speaker 1>that's the simple story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can say,</v>

1349
01:14:01.771 --> 01:14:04.140
<v Speaker 1>well there's more to the story in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

1350
01:14:04.530 --> 01:14:08.760
<v Speaker 1>There's also transformational grammar </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that kind of looks like this.</v>

1351
01:14:08.810 --> 01:14:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1352
01:14:10.770 --> 01:14:13.130
<v Speaker 1>it's w go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to ask you why,</v>

1353
01:14:13.390 --> 01:14:15.910
<v Speaker 1>why you chose to call the president </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbearable.</v>

1354
01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:17.073
<v Speaker 1>I mean that seems to have such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>striking implies a really strong effect </v>

1355
01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:22.360
<v Speaker 1>instead of letting it be imperfect or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1356
01:14:22.361 --> 01:14:23.200
<v Speaker 1>well it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1357
01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:24.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you say?</v>

1358
01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:26.410
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of satirical I guess.</v>

1359
01:14:26.410 --> 01:14:27.243
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always trying to change it no </v>

1360
01:14:27.821 --> 01:14:28.930
<v Speaker 1>matter what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1361
01:14:28.931 --> 01:14:30.070
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1362
01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:31.113
<v Speaker 1>Really quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read this really funny story in the </v>

1363
01:14:33.401 --> 01:14:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Atlantic magazine needs a weaken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hated liking it because,</v>

1364
01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:39.010
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did like,</v>

1365
01:14:39.011 --> 01:14:41.200
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1366
01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:42.213
<v Speaker 1>so this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a travel writer and he goes on one </v>

1367
01:14:43.331 --> 01:14:48.070
<v Speaker 1>of these cruises and everything's done </v>
<v Speaker 1>for absolutely everything.</v>

1368
01:14:48.071 --> 01:14:49.900
<v Speaker 1>It's like if he goes and goes swimming </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning,</v>

1369
01:14:49.930 --> 01:14:52.120
<v Speaker 1>in the morning and he sits down on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>beach chair,</v>

1370
01:14:52.121 --> 01:14:52.954
<v Speaker 1>he gets a towel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy there that's higher just </v>

1371
01:14:54.131 --> 01:14:56.980
<v Speaker 1>to make sure he has a tell and if he </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets up to walk around the pool,</v>

1372
01:14:57.430 --> 01:15:00.700
<v Speaker 1>the same guy's job is to go and get his </v>
<v Speaker 1>talent and replace it with another one.</v>

1373
01:15:00.730 --> 01:15:01.563
<v Speaker 1>I mean he doesn't have to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said he could eat at the restaurant </v>

1374
01:15:04.330 --> 01:15:08.650
<v Speaker 1>18 times a day and if he didn't feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like walking up to the restaurant and he</v>

1375
01:15:08.651 --> 01:15:09.484
<v Speaker 1>could call room service and get whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wanted and it would be there in 10 </v>

1376
01:15:11.351 --> 01:15:12.184
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

1377
01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:14.560
<v Speaker 1>As he said for the first three or four </v>
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>

1378
01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:17.830
<v Speaker 1>he was really guilty about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he couldn't stand the fact that,</v>

1379
01:15:18.090 --> 01:15:20.350
<v Speaker 1>well it's often uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people from the third world,</v>

1380
01:15:20.351 --> 01:15:21.970
<v Speaker 1>often man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he ships by the way,</v>

1381
01:15:21.971 --> 01:15:23.290
<v Speaker 1>because they weren't cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

1382
01:15:23.291 --> 01:15:27.010
<v Speaker 1>he was real guilty about having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being waited on hand and foot basically.</v>

1383
01:15:27.011 --> 01:15:29.380
<v Speaker 1>And so for the first two or three days </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was sort of racked by guilt.</v>

1384
01:15:29.381 --> 01:15:31.570
<v Speaker 1>But by the end he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is quick funny,</v>

1385
01:15:31.571 --> 01:15:32.404
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the end of the trip having adjusted </v>

1386
01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:35.913
<v Speaker 1>to his new circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was finding himself increasingly </v>

1387
01:15:39.221 --> 01:15:42.370
<v Speaker 1>irritated by the fact that when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>called for room service and they brought</v>

1388
01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:43.204
<v Speaker 1>him a sandwich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always put it too close to the </v>

1389
01:15:44.651 --> 01:15:47.700
<v Speaker 1>little decorative orange slice and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>edge of the guts.</v>

1390
01:15:47.701 --> 01:15:50.150
<v Speaker 1>Soggy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1391
01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:50.993
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1392
01:15:52.230 --> 01:15:53.250
<v Speaker 1>this is very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

1393
01:15:53.260 --> 01:15:54.560
<v Speaker 1>that's when people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you know,</v>

1394
01:15:54.561 --> 01:15:55.394
<v Speaker 1>he would just to sort of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your expectations of just to bounce the </v>

1395
01:15:58.151 --> 01:16:02.080
<v Speaker 1>situation and then you construe the </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational significance of events with</v>

1396
01:16:02.081 --> 01:16:04.660
<v Speaker 1>regards to that that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualization.</v>

1397
01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:07.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's kind of why I put that as like</v>

1398
01:16:07.091 --> 01:16:07.924
<v Speaker 1>for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unbearable president was the fact </v>

1399
01:16:09.131 --> 01:16:09.490
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1400
01:16:09.490 --> 01:16:13.410
<v Speaker 1>of the corner of his sandwich was soggy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was ready Urinetown of himself for,</v>

1401
01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:15.340
<v Speaker 1>for reacting in this manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he said,</v>

1402
01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:17.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just what people are like when we</v>

1403
01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:18.473
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're set of expectations alters </v>

1404
01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:23.710
<v Speaker 1>the valence of phenomena instantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes.</v>

1405
01:16:23.711 --> 01:16:25.790
<v Speaker 1>And that's why the Buddhists in part </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

1406
01:16:25.810 --> 01:16:27.100
<v Speaker 1>the world is my ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1407
01:16:27.101 --> 01:16:29.130
<v Speaker 1>You just generate a story about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>should happen.</v>

1408
01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:32.860
<v Speaker 1>You can switch the valence of phenomena </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually,</v>

1409
01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:35.830
<v Speaker 1>virtually at will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not entirely.</v>

1410
01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:37.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still certain constraints.</v>

1411
01:16:37.961 --> 01:16:38.794
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always trying to run from this </v>

1412
01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:44.980
<v Speaker 1>incense to get to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what your situation is</v>

1413
01:16:45.340 --> 01:16:46.173
<v Speaker 1>and this is permanent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that thing just moves more or less </v>

1414
01:16:48.161 --> 01:16:50.550
<v Speaker 1>with you wherever you move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1415
01:16:50.551 --> 01:16:52.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the simple story.</v>

1416
01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:56.720
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the more complex story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we'll talk about it in detail.</v>

1417
01:16:58.140 --> 01:17:00.130
<v Speaker 1>So when you have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the known,</v>

1418
01:17:00.131 --> 01:17:01.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an ideology,</v>

1419
01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:05.050
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1420
01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.390
<v Speaker 1>if something interferes with 20 year </v>
<v Speaker 1>plans,</v>

1421
01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:09.800
<v Speaker 1>something unexpected happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just switch to another plan.</v>

1422
01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:11.413
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I started again interferes with a </v>

1423
01:17:12.891 --> 01:17:15.290
<v Speaker 1>more fundamental precept position like </v>
<v Speaker 1>who you are,</v>

1424
01:17:15.291 --> 01:17:17.660
<v Speaker 1>where you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then this whole thing can come crumbling</v>

1425
01:17:17.661 --> 01:17:19.610
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's represented here.</v>

1426
01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:22.800
<v Speaker 1>And this is transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation,</v>

1427
01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:23.693
<v Speaker 1>grammar in since I guess it's how </v>
<v Speaker 1>conception a can turn it to conception </v>

1428
01:17:28.041 --> 01:17:29.000
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that,</v>

1429
01:17:29.310 --> 01:17:30.143
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's belief systems will shift </v>

1430
01:17:31.461 --> 01:17:33.870
<v Speaker 1>radically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you also need a structure for</v>

1431
01:17:34.830 --> 01:17:35.663
<v Speaker 2>mmm,</v>

1432
01:17:39.810 --> 01:17:42.080
<v Speaker 1>you have a belief system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing and you need one.</v>

1433
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:43.183
<v Speaker 1>But you also need a process by which </v>
<v Speaker 1>your belief system is outdated because </v>

1434
01:17:46.730 --> 01:17:47.563
<v Speaker 1>your belief system is supposed to map </v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment and the environment </v>

1435
01:17:49.941 --> 01:17:50.774
<v Speaker 1>keeps changing and now and then you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to undergo a fundamental revolution in </v>

1436
01:17:54.771 --> 01:17:56.420
<v Speaker 1>your beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's basically what this is.</v>

1437
01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:00.590
<v Speaker 1>When you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1438
01:18:00.591 --> 01:18:03.110
<v Speaker 1>you know the example I gave you will </v>
<v Speaker 1>read about it in detail.</v>

1439
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:04.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1440
01:18:04.821 --> 01:18:06.020
<v Speaker 1>there's a little story in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this,</v>

1441
01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:09.410
<v Speaker 1>in the book about this guy who was going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a meeting and he's going to be a real</v>

1442
01:18:09.411 --> 01:18:12.500
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This meeting is elevators late,</v>

1443
01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:13.393
<v Speaker 1>so he thinks he's going to be right in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the elevators late three </v>

1444
01:18:15.501 --> 01:18:16.334
<v Speaker 1>of distressing because he's construing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the significance of that with </v>

1445
01:18:18.471 --> 01:18:20.750
<v Speaker 1>relationship to his meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that makes them mad.</v>

1446
01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:21.583
<v Speaker 1>Nays down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes up in front of the building and </v>

1447
01:18:22.830 --> 01:18:25.020
<v Speaker 1>now he's kind of late to his meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a few blocks away.</v>

1448
01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:28.580
<v Speaker 1>Like anybody who gets in his way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes a massive little old ladies are</v>

1449
01:18:28.581 --> 01:18:29.414
<v Speaker 1>lovers out for a stroll or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He construes their existence with </v>

1450
01:18:33.891 --> 01:18:34.724
<v Speaker 1>regards to his plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you had lots of time while they </v>

1451
01:18:37.161 --> 01:18:39.110
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't bother him at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that he's late makes them a</v>

1452
01:18:39.111 --> 01:18:40.580
<v Speaker 1>bowl of irritation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1453
01:18:42.930 --> 01:18:45.150
<v Speaker 1>when the elevator doesn't show up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes to shift plan,</v>

1454
01:18:45.190 --> 01:18:47.900
<v Speaker 1>he goes down the stairs and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a minor league irritation.</v>

1455
01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:49.273
<v Speaker 1>Well say when he gets back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's done with his meeting and his boss </v>

1456
01:18:51.981 --> 01:18:55.730
<v Speaker 1>calls me into the office and set aside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fired,</v>

1457
01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:56.893
<v Speaker 1>you're incompetent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the worst employee we've ever </v>

1458
01:18:58.611 --> 01:19:00.290
<v Speaker 1>had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1459
01:19:00.650 --> 01:19:02.630
<v Speaker 1>he had visions of being a star in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>

1460
01:19:02.631 --> 01:19:05.000
<v Speaker 1>was evaluating everything with regards </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that.</v>

1461
01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:07.580
<v Speaker 1>It's still being quite irritated about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact,</v>

1462
01:19:07.581 --> 01:19:10.670
<v Speaker 1>say the elevator wouldn't show up like </v>
<v Speaker 1>now something's really make it happen to</v>

1463
01:19:10.671 --> 01:19:13.370
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a major league discrepancy.</v>

1464
01:19:13.371 --> 01:19:13.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1465
01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:15.860
<v Speaker 1>it's blown out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A few fundamental precept positions.</v>

1466
01:19:16.190 --> 01:19:19.580
<v Speaker 1>It's knocked out his version of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of who he is and what he's doing,</v>

1467
01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:21.960
<v Speaker 1>where he's going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's blown in.</v>

1468
01:19:21.961 --> 01:19:22.794
<v Speaker 1>The whole structure uses to interpret </v>
<v Speaker 1>the motivational significance of </v>

1469
01:19:25.131 --> 01:19:29.210
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon and that means that it's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>event that's not be emotionally neutral,</v>

1470
01:19:29.211 --> 01:19:30.120
<v Speaker 1>has taken place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

1471
01:19:30.290 --> 01:19:32.840
<v Speaker 1>it's an event that has a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of emotional significance.</v>

1472
01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:34.910
<v Speaker 1>He's very anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's very depressed.</v>

1473
01:19:35.150 --> 01:19:35.983
<v Speaker 1>It's like you could say in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'll try to outline this more </v>

1474
01:19:37.731 --> 01:19:40.970
<v Speaker 1>details because motivational systems are</v>
<v Speaker 1>no longer regulated.</v>

1475
01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:42.013
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't know what anything means </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore and when you don't know what </v>

1476
01:19:43.911 --> 01:19:46.310
<v Speaker 1>anything means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything makes you anxious.</v>

1477
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.863
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem.</v>

1478
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.450
<v Speaker 1>Actually this represents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's down here,</v>

1479
01:19:50.530 --> 01:19:52.430
<v Speaker 1>everything's gone chaotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said,</v>

1480
01:19:52.670 --> 01:19:56.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who I am anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that happens to people you know.</v>

1481
01:19:56.511 --> 01:19:59.570
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to reevaluate your whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>past and your present and your future,</v>

1482
01:19:59.571 --> 01:20:00.404
<v Speaker 1>your whole story shifts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything changes and maybe you can do </v>

1483
01:20:02.751 --> 01:20:03.584
<v Speaker 1>that or maybe you cut your throat </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that happens to people too and </v>

1484
01:20:05.621 --> 01:20:08.550
<v Speaker 1>everything falls down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just can't handle it.</v>

1485
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.720
<v Speaker 1>They're overwhelmed by their negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions and that kills them.</v>

1486
01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:14.700
<v Speaker 1>That's the end of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1487
01:20:14.701 --> 01:20:18.030
<v Speaker 1>let's say he pops back out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a little bit more humbled as time.</v>

1488
01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:19.033
<v Speaker 1>Figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he didn't like his God damn job </v>

1489
01:20:20.041 --> 01:20:21.690
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should have done something he wanted</v>

1490
01:20:21.691 --> 01:20:22.524
<v Speaker 1>to do a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it wouldn't be in such a bastard </v>

1491
01:20:23.761 --> 01:20:24.594
<v Speaker 1>and got fired in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His conceptions of who he is and why he </v>

1492
01:20:28.831 --> 01:20:33.090
<v Speaker 1>wants to be have changed because my </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions are reregulated.</v>

1493
01:20:33.090 --> 01:20:35.670
<v Speaker 1>He interprets the world from a slightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>different perspective,</v>

1494
01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:38.550
<v Speaker 1>but the metal structure of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective is still the safe.</v>

1495
01:20:38.710 --> 01:20:39.543
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was here in this kind of structure </v>

1496
01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:42.413
<v Speaker 1>when he was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's still in this kind of structure </v>

1497
01:20:44.401 --> 01:20:45.234
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just what the contents of the </v>

1498
01:20:46.381 --> 01:20:48.810
<v Speaker 1>structure and difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a stability,</v>

1499
01:20:49.730 --> 01:20:50.563
<v Speaker 1>there's a stability and structure as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well as flexibility for change within </v>

1500
01:20:53.191 --> 01:20:54.024
<v Speaker 1>the structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the big mythological story by </v>

1501
01:20:56.551 --> 01:20:57.970
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Set us up.</v>

1502
01:20:58.410 --> 01:21:01.260
<v Speaker 1>You can look at this all sorts of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll try to diagram this out later.</v>

1503
01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:05.340
<v Speaker 1>These are castles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kingdoms.</v>

1504
01:21:05.490 --> 01:21:07.890
<v Speaker 1>Say this is a dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1505
01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:10.290
<v Speaker 1>and then we'll discuss that in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>detail later.</v>

1506
01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:12.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you're in a corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1507
01:21:12.751 --> 01:21:15.600
<v Speaker 1>you share a dream with everybody in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation and you arrange yourself and</v>

1508
01:21:15.601 --> 01:21:16.434
<v Speaker 1>a power hierarchy to attain the goals of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the corporation to get from here to </v>

1509
01:21:19.951 --> 01:21:20.610
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1510
01:21:20.610 --> 01:21:21.443
<v Speaker 1>You move up the dominance hierarchy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in your best interest under those </v>

1511
01:21:23.731 --> 01:21:24.564
<v Speaker 1>circumstances to keep the corporation </v>
<v Speaker 1>going and also to prop yourself up the </v>

1512
01:21:27.211 --> 01:21:28.044
<v Speaker 1>levels of the dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a dominance hierarchy here </v>

1513
01:21:30.571 --> 01:21:34.340
<v Speaker 1>and the king of the dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's the CEO or whatever,</v>

1514
01:21:34.370 --> 01:21:35.203
<v Speaker 1>Hayes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the active representative of the </v>

1515
01:21:36.871 --> 01:21:37.704
<v Speaker 1>ideal future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which makes him the king basically from </v>

1516
01:21:39.781 --> 01:21:42.030
<v Speaker 1>the mythological perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

1517
01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:45.060
<v Speaker 1>so that's a community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a dragon.</v>

1518
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:47.143
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of looking at a dragon is</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that there's in a cave and </v>

1519
01:21:49.770 --> 01:21:52.200
<v Speaker 1>it's very dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it sits on something very promising.</v>

1520
01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:53.760
<v Speaker 1>Cord of treasure.</v>

1521
01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:57.353
<v Speaker 1>Dragons are the places that an almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>events emerged from say their </v>

1522
01:22:00.721 --> 01:22:04.140
<v Speaker 1>representations of the chaos that </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounds predictable territory.</v>

1523
01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:05.303
<v Speaker 1>The thing about chaos is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>threatening and policies at the same </v>

1524
01:22:07.651 --> 01:22:12.651
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1525
01:22:16.130 --> 01:22:16.963
<v Speaker 1>and it seems that the majority of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior is not able to be planned or </v>

1526
01:22:21.391 --> 01:22:22.560
<v Speaker 1>formulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Declaratively.</v>

1527
01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptive behavior</v>

1528
01:22:27.630 --> 01:22:28.463
<v Speaker 1>inside the little circles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I meant really my plan is that like </v>

1529
01:22:31.591 --> 01:22:32.424
<v Speaker 1>you draw on in your reservoir of </v>
<v Speaker 1>habitual behaviors and put them into </v>

1530
01:22:35.521 --> 01:22:38.610
<v Speaker 1>play to retain certain and so it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>even the guy rushing to the meeting,</v>

1531
01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:41.180
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have to think about how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>walk like that's a hope.</v>

1532
01:22:41.210 --> 01:22:43.320
<v Speaker 1>Those sequences of behaviors are already</v>
<v Speaker 1>habitual.</v>

1533
01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:44.340
<v Speaker 1>He just says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1534
01:22:45.090 --> 01:22:45.923
<v Speaker 1>the plan is I will walk there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that that's all I meant by that is </v>

1535
01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:50.333
<v Speaker 1>that you just have like your </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualization of your present state </v>

1536
01:22:54.151 --> 01:22:57.390
<v Speaker 1>is somewhat general and so as your </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualization of your ideal future,</v>

1537
01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:58.433
<v Speaker 1>but do you have specific plans to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>you from one state to another and you </v>

1538
01:23:02.161 --> 01:23:03.900
<v Speaker 1>can shift between the felt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

1539
01:23:03.901 --> 01:23:06.200
<v Speaker 1>this is a simplistic viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It that structure.</v>

1540
01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:09.060
<v Speaker 1>We'll look at the real structure of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>much later in the court stuff.</v>

1541
01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:10.533
<v Speaker 1>That's all I mean by it's just those are</v>
<v Speaker 1>sub routines that will enable you to </v>

1542
01:23:14.801 --> 01:23:15.790
<v Speaker 1>pursue your goal.</v>

1543
01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:17.153
<v Speaker 3>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what if you're doing something that </v>

1544
01:23:18.850 --> 01:23:21.310
<v Speaker 3>isn't adapted behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not something like walking,</v>

1545
01:23:21.311 --> 01:23:23.390
<v Speaker 3>it's something like trying to make a </v>
<v Speaker 3>good impression.</v>

1546
01:23:25.130 --> 01:23:25.963
<v Speaker 3>But what if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if you're taking some sort of </v>

1547
01:23:27.731 --> 01:23:31.360
<v Speaker 3>mythical knowledge that you've gotten </v>
<v Speaker 3>about how to make things work out,</v>

1548
01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:32.433
<v Speaker 3>but you can't formulate that the plan </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you have this goal and this is how </v>

1549
01:23:35.501 --> 01:23:37.870
<v Speaker 3>you're getting there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have a plan together that way.</v>

1550
01:23:37.871 --> 01:23:41.850
<v Speaker 3>You're just trying to get their hope on </v>
<v Speaker 3>a psychoanalysis,</v>

1551
01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:44.590
<v Speaker 3>but you can have plants that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a representation now,</v>

1552
01:23:44.650 --> 01:23:45.483
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean isn't that,</v>

1553
01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:46.493
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it only plans but even representations </v>

1554
01:23:47.591 --> 01:23:48.550
<v Speaker 1>of the ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1555
01:23:49.390 --> 01:23:50.680
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1556
01:23:50.681 --> 01:23:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Well it depends on your left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their level of representation.</v>

1557
01:23:54.610 --> 01:23:57.730
<v Speaker 1>So you can have fantasies that could </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't made explicit like this.</v>

1558
01:23:57.731 --> 01:23:58.780
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this,</v>

1559
01:23:58.781 --> 01:24:01.930
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a fantasy and so is this,</v>

1560
01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.310
<v Speaker 1>it's the fantasies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy here,</v>

1561
01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:08.730
<v Speaker 1>the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a motivational fit guide,</v>

1562
01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:11.440
<v Speaker 1>your motivational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational judgments,</v>

1563
01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:15.640
<v Speaker 1>your dreams about the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know what you're doing,</v>

1564
01:24:15.641 --> 01:24:18.120
<v Speaker 1>then you engage in exploratory behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1565
01:24:18.130 --> 01:24:19.120
<v Speaker 1>So it can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1566
01:24:19.121 --> 01:24:21.340
<v Speaker 1>I have this idea of future in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know how to get there.</v>

1567
01:24:21.710 --> 01:24:25.900
<v Speaker 1>Then you try out different patterns and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just that's something we'll discuss next</v>

1568
01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:27.100
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a,</v>

1569
01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:29.610
<v Speaker 1>that's a default positions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know where I want to go on,</v>

1570
01:24:29.611 --> 01:24:33.050
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know how to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So since I don't know how it,</v>

1571
01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:35.650
<v Speaker 1>since I don't know what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can I do?</v>

1572
01:24:36.810 --> 01:24:38.860
<v Speaker 1>That's a of a question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the answer is,</v>

1573
01:24:38.861 --> 01:24:41.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that is you start engaging</v>

1574
01:24:41.351 --> 01:24:46.351
<v Speaker 1>in exploratory behaviors of various </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts to make what you want to happen,</v>

1575
01:24:46.871 --> 01:24:47.704
<v Speaker 1>start happening.</v>

1576
01:24:49.330 --> 01:24:51.340
<v Speaker 3>That syncs the things that you do know </v>
<v Speaker 3>how to do that.</v>

1577
01:24:51.341 --> 01:24:52.600
<v Speaker 3>You don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know how to do.</v>

1578
01:24:52.810 --> 01:24:53.643
<v Speaker 3>They just fall inside that little tickle</v>
<v Speaker 3>on top like things that you're doing </v>

1579
01:24:56.441 --> 01:24:58.600
<v Speaker 3>without being aware of planning to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>then that way.</v>

1580
01:24:58.601 --> 01:24:59.434
<v Speaker 3>But you're doing them</v>

1581
01:24:59.590 --> 01:25:00.423
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would form sub routines of this </v>

1582
01:25:01.721 --> 01:25:03.420
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

1583
01:25:03.421 --> 01:25:04.160
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like,</v>

1584
01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:04.993
<v Speaker 1>you use what you know how to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>automatically in your attempt to do </v>

1585
01:25:09.521 --> 01:25:11.470
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is that you want to accomplish,</v>

1586
01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:12.423
<v Speaker 1>like walking or moving your hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you sequence those behaviors </v>

1587
01:25:15.851 --> 01:25:20.570
<v Speaker 1>that you already know how to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm in describing the first circle,</v>

1588
01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:23.480
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you basically described a kingdom,</v>

1589
01:25:23.490 --> 01:25:27.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>With an authoritarian rule and whatever.</v>

1590
01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:28.073
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to go into and during the </v>

1591
01:25:29.401 --> 01:25:31.140
<v Speaker 1>class what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of works best?</v>

1592
01:25:31.170 --> 01:25:32.230
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1593
01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:37.140
<v Speaker 1>you've also described elsewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember how democracy works and</v>

1594
01:25:37.350 --> 01:25:38.183
<v Speaker 1>how it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there isn't a general generalized </v>

1595
01:25:39.421 --> 01:25:40.220
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1596
01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:41.053
<v Speaker 1>but people have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hierarchy and there are certain </v>

1597
01:25:42.721 --> 01:25:44.090
<v Speaker 1>specializations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1598
01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:45.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1599
01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:45.863
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're still doing really introductory </v>

1600
01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:49.440
<v Speaker 1>introductory work can we will go into </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1601
01:25:49.470 --> 01:25:50.303
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

1602
01:25:50.670 --> 01:25:52.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause what I want to do is find out,</v>

1603
01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:56.820
<v Speaker 1>well this is the myth of the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1604
01:25:57.540 --> 01:25:59.250
<v Speaker 1>this is the sit up there with it.</v>

1605
01:25:59.550 --> 01:26:02.280
<v Speaker 1>It's this story that myths referred to </v>
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>

1606
01:26:02.281 --> 01:26:03.114
<v Speaker 1>particularly as the structure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptive structures and how they </v>

1607
01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:10.250
<v Speaker 1>transformed and when the myth is when </v>
<v Speaker 1>math is describing the world,</v>

1608
01:26:10.490 --> 01:26:11.323
<v Speaker 1>that's what it's describing said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well this is from the mythological </v>

1609
01:26:13.941 --> 01:26:14.774
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world is constructed of the </v>

1610
01:26:15.951 --> 01:26:18.730
<v Speaker 1>distinction between chaos and order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like before chaos,</v>

1611
01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:19.573
<v Speaker 1>in order divided,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have anything and you could </v>

1612
01:26:21.141 --> 01:26:24.020
<v Speaker 1>send them all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is chaos and this is order by order</v>

1613
01:26:24.021 --> 01:26:24.854
<v Speaker 1>is also something that has to transform </v>
<v Speaker 1>because anything orderly that doesn't </v>

1614
01:26:27.681 --> 01:26:31.640
<v Speaker 1>change dies because it's hard to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly why that is.</v>

1615
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Because things change and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep up with them is the simple answer.</v>

1616
01:26:35.241 --> 01:26:38.120
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just the as the case.</v>

1617
01:26:38.510 --> 01:26:41.540
<v Speaker 1>So the mythical world is the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always stable,</v>

1618
01:26:41.541 --> 01:26:44.780
<v Speaker 1>which is to say there's an unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's chaos.</v>

1619
01:26:44.781 --> 01:26:48.470
<v Speaker 1>It has a certain effect of Valence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is frightening and promising.</v>

1620
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:50.390
<v Speaker 1>That's always there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unknown.</v>

1621
01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:52.730
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the no and that's your </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

1622
01:26:52.731 --> 01:26:54.320
<v Speaker 1>That's the story you shared with </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>

1623
01:26:54.321 --> 01:26:57.380
<v Speaker 1>That's your procedures to bring about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want to bring about.</v>

1624
01:26:57.670 --> 01:26:59.600
<v Speaker 1>That's your kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's always there.</v>

1625
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:02.450
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a process that mediates</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the two.</v>

1626
01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:04.730
<v Speaker 1>That's you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's always there.</v>

1627
01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Those are the three constituent elements</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world,</v>

1628
01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:11.800
<v Speaker 1>chaos order and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the hero actually hold on those,</v>

1629
01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:15.530
<v Speaker 1>those all out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're split into positive and negative</v>

1630
01:27:15.531 --> 01:27:19.460
<v Speaker 1>representations and mythologies as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the mythological world.</v>

1631
01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:21.890
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's as far as I can tell,</v>

1632
01:27:21.891 --> 01:27:24.800
<v Speaker 1>it's a per ticket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said completely code internally,</v>

1633
01:27:24.801 --> 01:27:28.100
<v Speaker 1>coherent representation of experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it includes,</v>

1634
01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:29.893
<v Speaker 1>it's concentrates on if effect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Valence and motivational significance </v>

1635
01:27:32.601 --> 01:27:37.601
<v Speaker 1>rather than on sensor structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what sort of things would affect your</v>

1636
01:27:37.831 --> 01:27:41.270
<v Speaker 1>content is the new adaptive structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1637
01:27:41.271 --> 01:27:42.104
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean by what sorts of </v>

1638
01:27:42.771 --> 01:27:43.160
<v Speaker 1>things?</v>

1639
01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:43.993
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>w what would influence a particular </v>

1640
01:27:45.201 --> 01:27:49.940
<v Speaker 1>shape that it takes a particular story </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it tells hopefully past experience.</v>

1641
01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:53.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean these are like these are </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasies,</v>

1642
01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:55.460
<v Speaker 1>but to the degree that someone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>

1643
01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:56.503
<v Speaker 1>their fantasies that are constructed on </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge that's generated as a </v>

1644
01:27:59.481 --> 01:28:03.290
<v Speaker 1>consequence of past endeavors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say like you're doing something</v>

1645
01:28:03.291 --> 01:28:06.440
<v Speaker 1>and you have to fail in a major way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an unexpected way.</v>

1646
01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:07.693
<v Speaker 1>Well hopefully what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that basically means that there's a </v>

1647
01:28:10.341 --> 01:28:11.174
<v Speaker 1>bunch of information about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstance that you failed to either </v>

1648
01:28:13.581 --> 01:28:16.040
<v Speaker 1>notice or to adapt to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it means.</v>

1649
01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:19.100
<v Speaker 1>If a failure comes as a big surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a general rule,</v>

1650
01:28:19.190 --> 01:28:20.023
<v Speaker 1>you're not paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So hopefully what happens when this is </v>

1651
01:28:22.371 --> 01:28:24.920
<v Speaker 1>reconstructed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what sort of on a higher plane is</v>

1652
01:28:24.921 --> 01:28:28.970
<v Speaker 1>that all of the anomalous information </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you didn't take into account?</v>

1653
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:32.660
<v Speaker 1>Probably because it was threatening is </v>
<v Speaker 1>now incorporated in here.</v>

1654
01:28:33.050 --> 01:28:37.760
<v Speaker 1>So hopefully that sounds like koons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is not exactly that.</v>

1655
01:28:37.761 --> 01:28:39.560
<v Speaker 1>What Kuhn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what Kuhn was describing.</v>

1656
01:28:39.561 --> 01:28:43.250
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's normal science,</v>

1657
01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:44.113
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1658
01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:46.550
<v Speaker 1>Max Revolutionary Side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

1659
01:28:46.551 --> 01:28:51.551
<v Speaker 1>What Kuhn found basically was this </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure in science,</v>

1660
01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:52.653
<v Speaker 1>but what Kuhn found was only a </v>
<v Speaker 1>substructure of a much broader process </v>

1661
01:28:56.181 --> 01:28:57.014
<v Speaker 1>of adaptation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a mythic structure of </v>

1662
01:28:59.271 --> 01:29:00.500
<v Speaker 1>science then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1663
01:29:00.501 --> 01:29:01.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean what,</v>

1664
01:29:01.621 --> 01:29:02.454
<v Speaker 1>what tune was describing is how </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive systems stabilize and </v>

1665
01:29:05.551 --> 01:29:08.640
<v Speaker 1>restructure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the scientific domain.</v>

1666
01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:09.840
<v Speaker 1>But you could just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1667
01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:10.733
<v Speaker 1>cognitive systems stabilize and </v>
<v Speaker 1>restructure no matter what we're </v>

1668
01:29:14.611 --> 01:29:16.370
<v Speaker 1>applying to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So cool.</v>

1669
01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:20.320
<v Speaker 1>I now this is a very strange quirk of </v>
<v Speaker 1>history because you sadness,</v>

1670
01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:23.420
<v Speaker 1>like in 19 both 1930 said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1671
01:29:23.610 --> 01:29:27.090
<v Speaker 1>this is not a religious systems progress</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can't,</v>

1672
01:29:27.091 --> 01:29:29.790
<v Speaker 1>first reasons I cannot understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one seemed to notice that.</v>

1673
01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:30.833
<v Speaker 1>And then coon said at 1962 or 61 this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>how scientific systems transforming it </v>

1674
01:29:35.161 --> 01:29:38.550
<v Speaker 1>was like what was the revelation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

1675
01:29:38.610 --> 01:29:39.443
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's easier for people to accept </v>

1676
01:29:42.151 --> 01:29:42.984
<v Speaker 1>and understand probably in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific domain because we feel that </v>

1677
01:29:44.761 --> 01:29:47.980
<v Speaker 1>we understand that type of knowledge and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do because the rules are,</v>

1678
01:29:48.100 --> 01:29:50.850
<v Speaker 1>or explicit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's harder to understand how this works</v>

1679
01:29:50.851 --> 01:29:52.980
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about they elance.</v>

1680
01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:54.473
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1681
01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:57.420
<v Speaker 1>But the thing you have to remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I'm trying to,</v>

1682
01:29:57.421 --> 01:30:00.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to make this argument is as </v>
<v Speaker 1>concrete as possible.</v>

1683
01:30:01.220 --> 01:30:02.053
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt Damon says you have to because you </v>

1684
01:30:03.711 --> 01:30:07.580
<v Speaker 1>have to know how to behave and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get what you need out of the world.</v>

1685
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:12.260
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a structure for doing that.</v>

1686
01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:14.270
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's of primary importance.</v>

1687
01:30:14.271 --> 01:30:15.800
<v Speaker 1>That's why we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while we're alive,</v>

1688
01:30:15.850 --> 01:30:17.750
<v Speaker 1>everything else is just an adjunct to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1689
01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:19.910
<v Speaker 1>So when you're looking at this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

1690
01:30:19.911 --> 01:30:20.744
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at the most fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of cognition as far as I can </v>

1691
01:30:23.361 --> 01:30:24.194
<v Speaker 1>tell.</v>

1692
01:30:24.570 --> 01:30:26.180
<v Speaker 2>And you're,</v>

1693
01:30:26.260 --> 01:30:29.800
<v Speaker 1>you're basically the purpose of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognition as far as I can tell,</v>

1694
01:30:30.010 --> 01:30:32.740
<v Speaker 1>it's to regulate emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we have,</v>

1695
01:30:33.670 --> 01:30:36.610
<v Speaker 1>that's what it's good for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to not be in pain.</v>

1696
01:30:36.670 --> 01:30:37.503
<v Speaker 1>We want to not be anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to have a future that's full of </v>

1697
01:30:40.361 --> 01:30:41.194
<v Speaker 1>hope and and satisfaction and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>always trying to adjust our models of </v>

1698
01:30:44.261 --> 01:30:45.094
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully to ensure that battle curves </v>

1699
01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:51.430
<v Speaker 1>when we do more specific cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>exercises like sites,</v>

1700
01:30:51.460 --> 01:30:53.610
<v Speaker 1>well that's a subspecialty </v>
<v Speaker 1>specialization.</v>

1701
01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:55.840
<v Speaker 1>It's very useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully it's very useful.</v>

1702
01:30:56.710 --> 01:30:57.550
<v Speaker 1>It's dangerous too.</v>

1703
01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:01.113
<v Speaker 2>Other questions?</v>

1704
01:31:04.650 --> 01:31:07.400
<v Speaker 1>You may just say that the second is more</v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptive than the fall.</v>

1705
01:31:07.410 --> 01:31:11.160
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully it doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be,</v>

1706
01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:12.653
<v Speaker 1>you don't describe something that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>called retro regressive reestablishment </v>

1707
01:31:15.781 --> 01:31:16.614
<v Speaker 1>of the Persona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is you're trying to do something </v>

1708
01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:23.410
<v Speaker 1>and you fail and when you reorganize </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself sphere of the taxes,</v>

1709
01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:24.313
<v Speaker 1>much more constricted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like you can get worse as a </v>

1710
01:31:27.081 --> 01:31:27.914
<v Speaker 1>consequence of this if you just cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>all that anomalous information that you </v>

1711
01:31:32.361 --> 01:31:34.820
<v Speaker 1>haven't processed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just let that in.</v>

1712
01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:35.893
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't change you by letting it in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to adjust your behavior to the </v>

1713
01:31:39.681 --> 01:31:42.260
<v Speaker 1>anomalous territory and that takes a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1714
01:31:42.290 --> 01:31:43.123
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of ingenuity and a lot of hard </v>

1715
01:31:43.881 --> 01:31:45.530
<v Speaker 1>work and that's why fried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1716
01:31:45.531 --> 01:31:47.150
<v Speaker 1>fried found by the end of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1717
01:31:47.151 --> 01:31:51.620
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mira consciousness doesn't entail cure.</v>

1718
01:31:52.250 --> 01:31:54.560
<v Speaker 1>Well that's because just knowing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1719
01:31:54.561 --> 01:31:55.570
<v Speaker 1>there isn't the trick.</v>

1720
01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:59.060
<v Speaker 1>The trick is if there's a threat that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment,</v>

1721
01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:01.600
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say people find you obnoxious,</v>

1722
01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:05.020
<v Speaker 1>generally flow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that isn't what you want.</v>

1723
01:32:05.021 --> 01:32:08.230
<v Speaker 1>It's interfering with your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your future as well.</v>

1724
01:32:08.231 --> 01:32:09.064
<v Speaker 1>The problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just knowing that people will find you </v>

1725
01:32:10.391 --> 01:32:11.410
<v Speaker 1>have nauseous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's normal.</v>

1726
01:32:11.411 --> 01:32:12.244
<v Speaker 1>That useful to assimilate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>information is to take it in and move </v>

1727
01:32:17.950 --> 01:32:18.783
<v Speaker 1>differently and respond differently so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that other people are no longer that </v>

1728
01:32:24.371 --> 01:32:26.590
<v Speaker 1>category of things that's hostile </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards you.</v>

1729
01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:30.340
<v Speaker 1>So it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just heightened consciousness,</v>

1730
01:32:30.341 --> 01:32:34.480
<v Speaker 1>it's like total reconstruction of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral outputs.</v>

1731
01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:35.433
<v Speaker 1>You have to learn to pay attention and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to listen to and to have some respect </v>

1732
01:32:38.651 --> 01:32:40.860
<v Speaker 1>for somebody else's story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

1733
01:32:42.460 --> 01:32:44.470
<v Speaker 1>the new system also depends on what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>available.</v>

1734
01:32:44.471 --> 01:32:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you can repress me.</v>

1735
01:32:45.931 --> 01:32:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Is Your path available to talk to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>about double the ideologies around?</v>

1736
01:32:50.230 --> 01:32:51.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1737
01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:52.010
<v Speaker 1>because that's true.</v>

1738
01:32:52.010 --> 01:32:56.090
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to about what's there is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're proud of.</v>

1739
01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:57.610
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1740
01:32:57.670 --> 01:32:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

1741
01:32:58.570 --> 01:32:59.121
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why.</v>

1742
01:32:59.121 --> 01:33:01.840
<v Speaker 1>And how brainwashing institutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically work.</v>

1743
01:33:01.930 --> 01:33:02.763
<v Speaker 1>Will they toss the nautilus information </v>
<v Speaker 1>on you until you crack and then they </v>

1744
01:33:06.071 --> 01:33:10.060
<v Speaker 1>just throw a new system out to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When she grabbed onto immediately it,</v>

1745
01:33:10.061 --> 01:33:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Koreans did that during effectively two </v>
<v Speaker 1>American prisoners of war in the fifties</v>

1746
01:33:14.590 --> 01:33:15.700
<v Speaker 1>so now I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1747
01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:18.280
<v Speaker 1>it's not just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how the army works.</v>

1748
01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:23.700
<v Speaker 1>It's how fraternities work in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a more minimal sands.</v>

1749
01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:26.180
<v Speaker 1>That's how initiation ceremony </v>
<v Speaker 1>ceremonies.</v>

1750
01:33:26.980 --> 01:33:29.230
<v Speaker 1>So it's not always negative that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will curse.</v>

1751
01:33:29.231 --> 01:33:30.064
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only negative if what your hand is </v>

1752
01:33:32.470 --> 01:33:33.303
<v Speaker 1>less useful than what you had</v>
<v Speaker 1>or less useful than what you could have </v>

1753
01:33:38.100 --> 01:33:39.220
<v Speaker 1>constructed yourself.</v>

1754
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:47.590
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that was sort of randomly.</v>

1755
01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:57.120
<v Speaker 3>Any other questions?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the process of coming up with the</v>

1756
01:33:57.671 --> 01:33:58.504
<v Speaker 3>whole system like that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that imply that you should have </v>

1757
01:34:00.761 --> 01:34:05.380
<v Speaker 3>power over it or that it's exploration?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What</v>

1758
01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:11.740
<v Speaker 3>are you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where are you in?</v>

1759
01:34:13.770 --> 01:34:18.760
<v Speaker 3>Can you talk about you're here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're the thing that moves from here to</v>

1760
01:34:18.761 --> 01:34:21.160
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>

1761
01:34:21.161 --> 01:34:23.560
<v Speaker 3>if you're the person who comes up with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this system,</v>

1762
01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:24.473
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1763
01:34:25.690 --> 01:34:26.870
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1764
01:34:26.900 --> 01:34:30.980
<v Speaker 1>That's why the way is the proper path of</v>
<v Speaker 1>life from a mythological perspective.</v>

1765
01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:35.600
<v Speaker 1>And who identify with the way is instead</v>
<v Speaker 1>of identifying with this,</v>

1766
01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:36.813
<v Speaker 1>where are with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing that they're temporary is to </v>

1767
01:34:39.801 --> 01:34:40.634
<v Speaker 1>identify with this because it's the only</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that's constant across the </v>

1768
01:34:44.900 --> 01:34:46.340
<v Speaker 1>constant spans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

1769
01:34:46.341 --> 01:34:47.174
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no one territory and there's </v>

1770
01:34:49.071 --> 01:34:49.904
<v Speaker 1>unknown territory and there's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process by which what is generated out </v>

1771
01:34:52.491 --> 01:34:54.290
<v Speaker 1>of the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you said,</v>

1772
01:34:54.291 --> 01:34:56.030
<v Speaker 1>well where does the individual fit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>

1773
01:34:56.031 --> 01:35:00.740
<v Speaker 1>where are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well if you're doing this voluntarily,</v>

1774
01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:01.913
<v Speaker 1>then you're identifying with the process</v>
<v Speaker 1>by which cultural information is </v>

1775
01:35:04.491 --> 01:35:07.130
<v Speaker 1>generated rather than with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>information itself.</v>

1776
01:35:07.370 --> 01:35:11.600
<v Speaker 1>So that makes you always on the always </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the proper locale,</v>

1777
01:35:11.601 --> 01:35:13.460
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to construct the world.</v>

1778
01:35:13.670 --> 01:35:15.830
<v Speaker 1>That's where it will be less wear will </v>
<v Speaker 1>be interesting.</v>

1779
01:35:16.340 --> 01:35:18.860
<v Speaker 1>Occurrence is taking place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a proper place to live.</v>

1780
01:35:19.060 --> 01:35:19.893
<v Speaker 1>I'll give,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll close with that as an example of </v>

1781
01:35:21.471 --> 01:35:21.921
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

1782
01:35:21.921 --> 01:35:24.820
<v Speaker 1>well here's another symbol that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>all familiar with</v>

1783
01:35:28.610 --> 01:35:32.750
<v Speaker 1>that that's dao and down means two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1784
01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:35.810
<v Speaker 1>It either means the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on the translation,</v>

1785
01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:39.500
<v Speaker 1>the way which is that or it means </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>

1786
01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:43.820
<v Speaker 1>So to live in Dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to live in meaning.</v>

1787
01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:48.020
<v Speaker 1>And this symbol is a symbol of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>totality of the world.</v>

1788
01:35:48.410 --> 01:35:49.840
<v Speaker 1>And why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus,</v>

1789
01:35:49.850 --> 01:35:54.850
<v Speaker 1>because this is chaos and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually give it the feminine connotation</v>

1790
01:35:55.641 --> 01:35:58.280
<v Speaker 1>for reasons that we'll discuss later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is ordered</v>

1791
01:36:00.350 --> 01:36:01.183
<v Speaker 1>and it's chaos and it's the split </v>
<v Speaker 1>between chaos and order and the mutual </v>

1792
01:36:04.311 --> 01:36:05.144
<v Speaker 1>coexistence that makes the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this dog is black because anything </v>

1793
01:36:11.451 --> 01:36:13.550
<v Speaker 1>orderly can immediately be turned into </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>

1794
01:36:13.551 --> 01:36:14.384
<v Speaker 1>more or less unpredictably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes by your own efforts and </v>

1795
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:21.440
<v Speaker 1>chaos can also be turned in order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why this little dog is white.</v>

1796
01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:24.380
<v Speaker 1>Also by your own efforts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exploration does that.</v>

1797
01:36:25.140 --> 01:36:25.973
<v Speaker 1>And Dow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the man who lives in down lives on </v>

1798
01:36:28.140 --> 01:36:33.140
<v Speaker 1>deadline with one foot in order and one </v>
<v Speaker 1>foot in chaos and the reason for that.</v>

1799
01:36:35.931 --> 01:36:38.000
<v Speaker 1>So that's where all the interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are happening.</v>

1800
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:39.860
<v Speaker 1>That's where the information is flowing.</v>

1801
01:36:40.100 --> 01:36:42.230
<v Speaker 1>If you're all here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you predict everything,</v>

1802
01:36:42.650 --> 01:36:43.483
<v Speaker 1>well that's secure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's boring and it's not just </v>

1803
01:36:45.861 --> 01:36:47.480
<v Speaker 1>boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Symbolic,</v>

1804
01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:48.663
<v Speaker 1>it defines boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no new information happening </v>

1805
01:36:51.711 --> 01:36:52.910
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're here,</v>

1806
01:36:52.911 --> 01:36:53.744
<v Speaker 1>well there are so overwhelmed with new </v>
<v Speaker 1>information that that you can't do </v>

1807
01:36:57.381 --> 01:36:59.810
<v Speaker 1>anything with it and you want to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1808
01:37:00.530 --> 01:37:03.200
<v Speaker 1>And if you're here and you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1809
01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:06.920
<v Speaker 1>you're paying attention to anomalous </v>
<v Speaker 1>information always.</v>

1810
01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:11.510
<v Speaker 1>You're allowing that to destabilize this</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure when it's necessary,</v>

1811
01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:12.673
<v Speaker 1>they have to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the hero in the belly of the </v>

1812
01:37:14.151 --> 01:37:14.871
<v Speaker 1>beast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1813
01:37:14.871 --> 01:37:19.020
<v Speaker 1>are the sun would packs it's way out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dragon at night and back up.</v>

1814
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:21.343
<v Speaker 1>So that's the path of the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in terms of systems that are stable </v>

1815
01:37:25.071 --> 01:37:29.210
<v Speaker 1>over time and an authoritarian system </v>
<v Speaker 1>says this is not necessary.</v>

1816
01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:33.640
<v Speaker 1>So if the case as things change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a system that's property,</v>

1817
01:37:33.650 --> 01:37:34.483
<v Speaker 1>government said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we need this but we also need this </v>

1818
01:37:39.110 --> 01:37:39.943
<v Speaker 1>and therefore we're going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>allow a certain amount of disorder into </v>

1819
01:37:42.651 --> 01:37:45.560
<v Speaker 1>the system so that flexibility can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintained.</v>

1820
01:37:47.610 --> 01:37:48.630
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1821
01:37:48.690 --> 01:37:52.160
<v Speaker 1>the trick is belts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like too much novelty.</v>

1822
01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:55.800
<v Speaker 1>Everything degenerates too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>

1823
01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:57.660
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Petrifies.</v>

1824
01:37:57.870 --> 01:37:58.703
<v Speaker 1>You wore the right on the proper edge </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the way that you can tell you're on </v>

1825
01:38:02.811 --> 01:38:05.220
<v Speaker 1>the edge when you were interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's,</v>

1826
01:38:05.221 --> 01:38:06.780
<v Speaker 1>that's the sign that says you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1827
01:38:06.781 --> 01:38:09.330
<v Speaker 1>there's an effect of sign post that </v>
<v Speaker 1>tells you when you're here.</v>

1828
01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:11.970
<v Speaker 1>If you're here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're interested.</v>

1829
01:38:12.450 --> 01:38:14.070
<v Speaker 1>If you're here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're terrified.</v>

1830
01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:15.240
<v Speaker 1>You're here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your board,</v>

1831
01:38:15.450 --> 01:38:20.450
<v Speaker 1>it would be right in the middle of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that means your brain is on and</v>

1832
01:38:20.670 --> 01:38:21.503
<v Speaker 1>it's optimal in an optimal manner </v>
<v Speaker 1>because your sensory systems are </v>

1833
01:38:24.661 --> 01:38:26.880
<v Speaker 1>probably heightened because you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit anxious.</v>

1834
01:38:27.270 --> 01:38:29.530
<v Speaker 1>You're doing a lot of exploration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We find it that pleasurable,</v>

1835
01:38:29.531 --> 01:38:32.340
<v Speaker 1>like last left frontal activation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like that.</v>

1836
01:38:32.550 --> 01:38:35.970
<v Speaker 1>That's incentive reward pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what cocaine does to you is this.</v>

1837
01:38:36.510 --> 01:38:37.740
<v Speaker 1>When you're here you're on.</v>

1838
01:38:39.220 --> 01:38:41.070
<v Speaker 1>It's analgesic too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of interesting.</v>

1839
01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:43.410
<v Speaker 1>There's no work flow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1840
01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:46.470
<v Speaker 1>It's not quite though because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with things like flow,</v>

1841
01:38:46.471 --> 01:38:47.304
<v Speaker 1>and this is Joseph Campbell's thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is they're always talking about </v>

1842
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:55.020
<v Speaker 1>following your happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not right to get here.</v>

1843
01:38:55.410 --> 01:39:00.390
<v Speaker 1>What you have to do is look at things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you hate from is no one would buy a</v>

1844
01:39:00.391 --> 01:39:04.560
<v Speaker 1>book that tells them that it's a flow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

1845
01:39:04.561 --> 01:39:06.480
<v Speaker 1>but this is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a major problem.</v>

1846
01:39:06.810 --> 01:39:07.643
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with new age philosophy in </v>

1847
01:39:08.911 --> 01:39:09.744
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the normally that you have to face </v>

1848
01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:13.783
<v Speaker 1>and the a priori motivational </v>
<v Speaker 1>significance of an anomaly is terror </v>

1849
01:39:20.650 --> 01:39:23.640
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise people would be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>flow all the time and they're not,</v>

1850
01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:56.720
<v Speaker 2>it</v>
<v Speaker 2>looks expensive.</v>
