1
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.183
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm talking today with Dr Michael </v>

2
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:19.303
<v Speaker 1>Shermer and darker Schermer is among </v>
<v Speaker 1>other things the publisher of skeptic </v>

3
00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:23.054
<v Speaker 1>magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly for our purposes </v>

4
00:00:25.011 --> 00:00:27.170
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is also the author of this book,</v>

5
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.063
<v Speaker 1>New Book and were heaven on Earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to talk about this today in </v>

6
00:00:32.931 --> 00:00:33.764
<v Speaker 1>some detail and so I'm going to turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>this over to Dr Sherman who's going to </v>

7
00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:39.500
<v Speaker 1>tell you some things about himself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then we're going to have a discussion,</v>

8
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.353
<v Speaker 1>is going to outline this book and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have a discussion about </v>

9
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why he wrote it and what it contains and</v>

10
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.760
<v Speaker 1>what the implications are and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

11
00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:50.230
<v Speaker 1>So over to you Michael Jordan.</v>

12
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.180
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for having me on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

13
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.943
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the book is kind of an extension of my </v>

14
00:00:56.051 --> 00:00:58.690
<v Speaker 2>previous work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of my books when I write them,</v>

15
00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:00.690
<v Speaker 2>they kind of push off from the previous </v>
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>

16
00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:02.740
<v Speaker 2>so going all the way back to my first </v>
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>

17
00:01:02.741 --> 00:01:03.574
<v Speaker 2>white people believe were things which </v>
<v Speaker 2>was about the supernatural and </v>

18
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.300
<v Speaker 2>paranormal and and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then then that led to how we believe,</v>

19
00:01:10.301 --> 00:01:11.134
<v Speaker 2>which was white people believe in God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then if you don't believe in the </v>

20
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.510
<v Speaker 2>supernatural and you don't believe in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>deity,</v>

21
00:01:16.511 --> 00:01:19.120
<v Speaker 2>what about morality?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I wrote two books on math and science</v>

22
00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:21.340
<v Speaker 2>of good and evil and the moral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our last book,</v>

23
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:22.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then,</v>

24
00:01:22.811 --> 00:01:25.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of covering all the big subjects,</v>

25
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a skeptical,</v>

26
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:28.443
<v Speaker 2>scientific perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The afterlife is obviously a huge one </v>

27
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.940
<v Speaker 2>and I haven't really dealt with that too</v>
<v Speaker 2>much in my previous books.</v>

28
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.980
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that I'm in my sixties,</v>

29
00:01:35.981 --> 00:01:37.750
<v Speaker 2>I guess you could say I'm cramming for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the final</v>

30
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:40.623
<v Speaker 2>thinking about these big issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not something that I obsess </v>

31
00:01:42.431 --> 00:01:44.480
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not terrorized by death like,</v>

32
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.413
<v Speaker 2>like some people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's a super interesting </v>

33
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.780
<v Speaker 2>subject because it's obviously a part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the human condition.</v>

34
00:01:52.781 --> 00:01:53.614
<v Speaker 2>It's something people do think about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And apparently we're the only species </v>

35
00:01:57.161 --> 00:01:57.994
<v Speaker 2>that can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although I have a chapter in heavens on </v>

36
00:01:59.831 --> 00:02:02.560
<v Speaker 2>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on animals that grieve clearly.</v>

37
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.550
<v Speaker 2>Quite a few mammals do grieve and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have some sense of loss,</v>

38
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.320
<v Speaker 2>death and grief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

39
00:02:08.321 --> 00:02:11.650
<v Speaker 2>for fellow group members or family </v>
<v Speaker 2>members that die,</v>

40
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.410
<v Speaker 2>but it's not clear that they understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>that their moral.</v>

41
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I,</v>

42
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.963
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had covered the possibility that </v>

43
00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:19.204
<v Speaker 2>neanderthals were self aware of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>mortality because of grave goods that </v>

44
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:23.463
<v Speaker 2>have been found,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although that's hard to fossil fossil </v>

45
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.270
<v Speaker 2>fossilization of bots is difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpret,</v>

46
00:02:28.271 --> 00:02:31.030
<v Speaker 2>but it seems reasonable that they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sense of that.</v>

47
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.420
<v Speaker 2>But in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

48
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.760
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I deal with the,</v>

49
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

50
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.030
<v Speaker 2>the monotheisms versions of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>afterlife,</v>

51
00:02:40.031 --> 00:02:42.370
<v Speaker 2>Heaven and mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Judaism,</v>

52
00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:43.204
<v Speaker 2>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam that mainly because you sort of </v>

53
00:02:45.101 --> 00:02:47.620
<v Speaker 2>have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although mine's a science book and those</v>

54
00:02:47.621 --> 00:02:48.454
<v Speaker 2>are sort of low hanging fruit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>atheists have already kind of picked </v>

55
00:02:51.181 --> 00:02:53.380
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't spend a lot of time on that.</v>

56
00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:58.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm focused more on scientific attempts </v>
<v Speaker 2>to achieve and mortality and science.</v>

57
00:02:58.091 --> 00:03:01.000
<v Speaker 2>So actually start with what does it seem</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a scientist,</v>

58
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.583
<v Speaker 2>Deepak Chopra,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worldview of sort of western Buddhism </v>

59
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there is the idea of birth,</v>

60
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:09.964
<v Speaker 2>death and afterlife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Life before life is all kind of </v>

61
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.680
<v Speaker 2>meaningless because it's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness in a deep box worldview as</v>

62
00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:18.990
<v Speaker 2>he puts it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

63
00:03:18.991 --> 00:03:19.824
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness is the ontological </v>

64
00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 2>primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't get underneath it a,</v>

65
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:25.443
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the scientific attempt to explain it by </v>

66
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:27.784
<v Speaker 2>material means will always fail because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not where consciousness wise </v>

67
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.210
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

68
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.163
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks to my wife actually delved into </v>

69
00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:40.000
<v Speaker 2>his world view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Deepak and I have class for 20 years and</v>

70
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:43.380
<v Speaker 2>I've called his worldview woo and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pseudoscience and,</v>

71
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.253
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been kind of at odds at each </v>

72
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as it changes,</v>

73
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.650
<v Speaker 1>he's sort of the main,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

74
00:03:49.651 --> 00:03:50.484
<v Speaker 1>intellectual force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's unreasonable to say </v>

75
00:03:52.501 --> 00:03:53.334
<v Speaker 1>the main intellectual force behind the </v>
<v Speaker 1>new age movement or associated with the </v>

76
00:03:56.251 --> 00:03:57.300
<v Speaker 1>new age movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>

77
00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.633
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly one of the most prominent </v>

78
00:04:00.291 --> 00:04:02.090
<v Speaker 2>ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a huge following.</v>

79
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.493
<v Speaker 2>He goes on Oprah and talks about these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and Dr Oz or whoever and you </v>

80
00:04:07.261 --> 00:04:08.310
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has a lot of following.</v>

81
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.500
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

82
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.370
<v Speaker 2>so my wife and I actually went down to </v>
<v Speaker 2>his center or center in Carlsbad,</v>

83
00:04:13.371 --> 00:04:15.410
<v Speaker 2>California and spent some time there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get,</v>

84
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.263
<v Speaker 2>we delved into meditation and Yoga and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tea and the chanting and all that </v>

85
00:04:19.101 --> 00:04:20.810
<v Speaker 2>stuff just to kind of see what it's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

86
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.090
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

87
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.933
<v Speaker 2>I think there's something there in terms</v>
<v Speaker 2>of behavioral change that is how it </v>

88
00:04:25.161 --> 00:04:27.710
<v Speaker 2>affects your body and your mind and your</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>

89
00:04:27.711 --> 00:04:30.670
<v Speaker 2>And I could definitely see something to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and um,</v>

90
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.821
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

91
00:04:31.821 --> 00:04:34.940
<v Speaker 2>but also the difficult part that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that feedback and I have had is the same</v>

92
00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:39.941
<v Speaker 2>problem that most scientists have with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>new age beliefs but not just that,</v>

93
00:04:40.011 --> 00:04:43.500
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of non western traditions that,</v>

94
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.510
<v Speaker 2>what Deepak calls the eastern wisdom </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditions that it's the language,</v>

95
00:04:47.511 --> 00:04:48.620
<v Speaker 2>the difficulty of language.</v>

96
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.800
<v Speaker 2>We have to use words to communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

97
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.710
<v Speaker 2>and the words you use matter at some </v>
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>

98
00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:58.340
<v Speaker 2>You have to be able to be talking on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same level with words.</v>

99
00:04:58.341 --> 00:05:01.470
<v Speaker 2>So when Deepak says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

100
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.240
<v Speaker 2>the ontological primitive or </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness is the womb of creation,</v>

101
00:05:05.241 --> 00:05:05.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are,</v>

102
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:06.763
<v Speaker 2>it sounds sort of metaphorical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he means something very specific by </v>

103
00:05:09.201 --> 00:05:10.790
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can't get at that,</v>

104
00:05:10.791 --> 00:05:11.624
<v Speaker 2>then you're wasting your time talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm Deepak and I have kind of become </v>

105
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.973
<v Speaker 2>friends and we were constantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicating just to try to see if we </v>

106
00:05:18.201 --> 00:05:22.730
<v Speaker 2>can find some ground where we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the same plane.</v>

107
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.530
<v Speaker 2>And so I think I've a learned a lot from</v>
<v Speaker 2>him in that,</v>

108
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.533
<v Speaker 2>in that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so my chapters devoted to him on </v>

109
00:05:28.641 --> 00:05:31.580
<v Speaker 2>that and the general eastern wisdom </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditions,</v>

110
00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:33.980
<v Speaker 2>you know that when you die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I always ask them,</v>

111
00:05:33.981 --> 00:05:34.670
<v Speaker 2>well where do you go?</v>

112
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.500
<v Speaker 2>And he says the wrong question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

113
00:05:36.501 --> 00:05:38.230
<v Speaker 2>you've just returned to where you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

114
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:39.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because when people ask me,</v>

115
00:05:39.981 --> 00:05:41.690
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think happens after you die?</v>

116
00:05:41.691 --> 00:05:44.600
<v Speaker 2>My standard kind of quip is the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

117
00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.760
<v Speaker 2>You go to the same place you were before</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were born.</v>

118
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.690
<v Speaker 2>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't anywhere before I was born.</v>

119
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.640
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you'll be nowhere after you die,</v>

120
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.500
<v Speaker 2>but for Deepak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>time and consciousness kind of overrides</v>

121
00:05:57.501 --> 00:06:02.450
<v Speaker 2>the concept of time at the beginning of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your consciousness just returns to where</v>

122
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:03.284
<v Speaker 2>it was and that the physical body and </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain is just a temporary instantiation </v>

123
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:09.403
<v Speaker 2>of consciousness into physical be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it just goes back to some other </v>

124
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.480
<v Speaker 2>place and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and near as I can figure,</v>

125
00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:17.330
<v Speaker 2>we don't have the words to even conceive</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what that means.</v>

126
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.940
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the western language,</v>

127
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.380
<v Speaker 2>the way scientists talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't really capture what he's talking</v>

128
00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:28.050
<v Speaker 2>about in that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's why I think we kind of hit</v>

129
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:33.070
<v Speaker 2>an epistemological wall there where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to actually get into introspection,</v>

130
00:06:33.381 --> 00:06:34.214
<v Speaker 2>meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that the deeper parts of that </v>

131
00:06:36.471 --> 00:06:40.040
<v Speaker 2>tradition that I've never been able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>really get into personally.</v>

132
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:44.990
<v Speaker 2>So I can't say I understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I kind of see where he's coming</v>

133
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:45.830
<v Speaker 2>from in that regard.</v>

134
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:47.263
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let me ask you some questions about </v>

135
00:06:48.471 --> 00:06:49.304
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first might have to do with this </v>

136
00:06:51.921 --> 00:06:55.130
<v Speaker 1>idea of the ontological primacy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

137
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.053
<v Speaker 1>Say now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I've learned from </v>

138
00:06:57.771 --> 00:07:00.920
<v Speaker 1>studying mythology is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological worldview,</v>

139
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:01.783
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the mythological worldview </v>

140
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:08.300
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizes the world as a place to </v>
<v Speaker 1>act rather than as a place of things.</v>

141
00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:09.134
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of like Steven g dot j Dot </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gould's idea of two magistarium don't </v>

142
00:07:12.981 --> 00:07:13.814
<v Speaker 1>overlap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a moral magistarium materialist </v>

143
00:07:16.041 --> 00:07:19.250
<v Speaker 1>magistarium say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's been striking to me,</v>

144
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:20.323
<v Speaker 1>looking at the architect will </v>
<v Speaker 1>foundations of mythological thinking </v>

145
00:07:22.521 --> 00:07:23.354
<v Speaker 1>that in the in the scientific worldview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there seemed to be two fundamental </v>

146
00:07:27.321 --> 00:07:29.920
<v Speaker 1>causal elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say nature and nurture,</v>

147
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.660
<v Speaker 1>something like that or biology and </v>
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>

148
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:33.763
<v Speaker 1>and then technically sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 1>western academics argue about the </v>

149
00:07:38.571 --> 00:07:43.340
<v Speaker 1>relative contribution of each to any </v>
<v Speaker 1>given a existential phenomena.</v>

150
00:07:43.341 --> 00:07:46.400
<v Speaker 1>But in the mythological worldview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always three actors.</v>

151
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:47.503
<v Speaker 1>There's nature usually personified as </v>
<v Speaker 1>female or experienced as female because </v>

152
00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.370
<v Speaker 1>personified isn't quite the right word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's culture,</v>

153
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.600
<v Speaker 1>but there's also the individual and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual seems to be the same thing as</v>

154
00:07:59.601 --> 00:08:01.410
<v Speaker 1>the conscious actor and that would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hero,</v>

155
00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:05.150
<v Speaker 1>the dragon slaying hero say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's that.</v>

156
00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.910
<v Speaker 1>There is a kind of primacy given to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

157
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:08.893
<v Speaker 1>So in the oldest creation myths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you always see this interplay between </v>

158
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.333
<v Speaker 1>the mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often mother earth and the father that </v>

159
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:16.573
<v Speaker 1>the sky and then the hero who separates </v>
<v Speaker 1>the two and somehow brings and </v>

160
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.433
<v Speaker 1>perversely in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although being their product clearly as </v>

161
00:08:24.861 --> 00:08:28.520
<v Speaker 1>the offspring is also the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>gives rise to them mouth the same.</v>

162
00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:29.923
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it seems to be something that's in </v>

163
00:08:32.691 --> 00:08:33.524
<v Speaker 1>keeping in some sense with our lived </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences that we confront the social </v>

164
00:08:37.251 --> 00:08:41.900
<v Speaker 1>world obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our beneficiaries and victims of it,</v>

165
00:08:41.901 --> 00:08:45.260
<v Speaker 1>and we confront the natural world in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same manner,</v>

166
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:46.243
<v Speaker 1>but we also seem to be a gentek actors </v>
<v Speaker 1>and without us as a Gentek actor is the </v>

167
00:08:51.651 --> 00:08:53.690
<v Speaker 1>idea that there's a reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to,</v>

168
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:58.590
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be full of paradoxical holes</v>
<v Speaker 1>like reality without a conscious actor.</v>

169
00:08:58.590 --> 00:08:59.940
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's the sort of statement</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

170
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.000
<v Speaker 1>that generates the thinking that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>referred to as characteristic of,</v>

171
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.830
<v Speaker 1>of Deepak Chopra and the people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who make those sorts of claims.</v>

172
00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:09.930
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

173
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.870
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your,</v>

174
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.800
<v Speaker 1>what's your take on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on consciousness and its role in being.</v>

175
00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one hand,</v>

176
00:09:19.621 --> 00:09:24.230
<v Speaker 2>it's everything because it's what I tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I tell Deepak,</v>

177
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:25.950
<v Speaker 2>what I write about in that chapter is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

178
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:27.163
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're familiar with the anthropic </v>

179
00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:30.460
<v Speaker 2>principle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I call this the,</v>

180
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.200
<v Speaker 2>that the week consciousness principle </v>
<v Speaker 2>that without consciousness,</v>

181
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.870
<v Speaker 2>without consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing exists.</v>

182
00:09:36.871 --> 00:09:37.704
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the points that he makes </v>

183
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.340
<v Speaker 2>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you personally,</v>

184
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.000
<v Speaker 2>if we're dead or we're not conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world doesn't exist for our brains,</v>

185
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:46.200
<v Speaker 2>it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

186
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:47.910
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

187
00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:49.620
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he goes further than that.</v>

188
00:09:49.621 --> 00:09:50.454
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I call the strong </v>

189
00:09:51.451 --> 00:09:52.740
<v Speaker 2>consciousness principle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

190
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:53.993
<v Speaker 2>that consciousness has required.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our consciousness is required for </v>

191
00:09:57.091 --> 00:10:01.660
<v Speaker 2>material things to exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there I have a discussion of what</v>

192
00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:03.003
<v Speaker 2>a Donald Hoffman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cognitive scientists at UC Irvine </v>

193
00:10:05.881 --> 00:10:07.640
<v Speaker 2>calls is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

194
00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:10.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the interface perception theory.</v>

195
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:12.600
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno if you're familiar with this,</v>

196
00:10:12.601 --> 00:10:13.434
<v Speaker 2>but his analogy is like your laptop </v>
<v Speaker 2>screen here and you'd have these icons </v>

197
00:10:17.191 --> 00:10:21.150
<v Speaker 2>on the screen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the little trashcan icon looks like</v>

198
00:10:21.151 --> 00:10:21.750
<v Speaker 2>a trash can.</v>

199
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.400
<v Speaker 2>But of course there's no trash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get the open,</v>

200
00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:25.680
<v Speaker 2>the open your laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no trash can.</v>

201
00:10:25.681 --> 00:10:26.430
<v Speaker 2>And there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

202
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:27.263
<v Speaker 2>these are just kind of icons that </v>
<v Speaker 2>represent something that we think of as </v>

203
00:10:30.361 --> 00:10:31.500
<v Speaker 2>a trash can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

204
00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:32.880
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

205
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:34.250
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets to the problem of,</v>

206
00:10:34.251 --> 00:10:35.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it's like to be a bat,</v>

207
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.120
<v Speaker 2>a famous thought experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

208
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:40.860
<v Speaker 2>if like bolted on some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some huge years.</v>

209
00:10:40.861 --> 00:10:45.090
<v Speaker 2>And I and I had an echolocation system </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the neural processes to process that</v>

210
00:10:45.091 --> 00:10:45.924
<v Speaker 2>information and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have some sense of what it's </v>

211
00:10:48.091 --> 00:10:48.924
<v Speaker 2>like to be a vet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it had everything on to actually be </v>

212
00:10:52.351 --> 00:10:54.670
<v Speaker 2>a bet that I would just be a bat and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't even be,</v>

213
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.630
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't even know I was a human </v>
<v Speaker 2>wondering what it's like to be a bad.</v>

214
00:10:57.631 --> 00:10:59.850
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at some level we can't actually know,</v>

215
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:01.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

216
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.340
<v Speaker 2>what it's like to be something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you,</v>

217
00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:04.783
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Deepak and I and these kinds of </v>

218
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:06.653
<v Speaker 2>traditions like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we hit this system logical wall of </v>

219
00:11:09.361 --> 00:11:10.194
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult to say what you mean by </v>

220
00:11:11.521 --> 00:11:12.354
<v Speaker 2>certain things.</v>

221
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.513
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you get down to the </v>

222
00:11:15.071 --> 00:11:16.300
<v Speaker 1>fundamentals of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

223
00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:20.520
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty clear that the things that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let.</v>

224
00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.373
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at that user interface idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So obviously what happens when you're </v>

225
00:11:25.631 --> 00:11:29.620
<v Speaker 1>looking at a computer screen is that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity of the screen is reduced to a</v>

226
00:11:29.621 --> 00:11:32.900
<v Speaker 1>set of icons that can serve as tools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

227
00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:33.903
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's a reasonable way</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thinking about how we look at the </v>

228
00:11:35.831 --> 00:11:36.664
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is</v>

229
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.940
<v Speaker 2>Theory is that natural selection didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>select our brains to,</v>

230
00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:44.110
<v Speaker 2>to record an accurate representation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>

231
00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:45.423
<v Speaker 2>like a scientific model will attempts to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get ever closer to what reality is </v>

232
00:11:47.771 --> 00:11:51.080
<v Speaker 2>really like no natural selection just </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants us to escape predators.</v>

233
00:11:51.081 --> 00:11:51.914
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter what they look like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the icon in your brain of breads </v>

234
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.250
<v Speaker 2>that spraying or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as you survive,</v>

235
00:11:57.251 --> 00:11:58.084
<v Speaker 2>that's all that matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is why we're so easily deceived </v>

236
00:12:00.611 --> 00:12:03.360
<v Speaker 2>by illusions and magic tricks and things</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that that,</v>

237
00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:05.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our brains aren't really wired to,</v>

238
00:12:05.581 --> 00:12:08.170
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to represent reality as it really is,</v>

239
00:12:08.171 --> 00:12:09.260
<v Speaker 2>whatever that means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

240
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:11.613
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say that without human </v>

241
00:12:13.161 --> 00:12:16.760
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the iconic reality that we inhabit would</v>

242
00:12:16.761 --> 00:12:18.150
<v Speaker 1>not exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

243
00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:23.160
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Slightly is that is I told them.</v>

244
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.490
<v Speaker 2>So let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

245
00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.030
<v Speaker 2>what's it like to be adults in it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

246
00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.390
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So some kind of echolocation system.</v>

247
00:12:29.391 --> 00:12:30.750
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and his point is,</v>

248
00:12:30.751 --> 00:12:31.250
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

249
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sharks are dangerous.</v>

250
00:12:32.641 --> 00:12:33.760
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

251
00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:35.340
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they avoid charts.</v>

252
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:36.183
<v Speaker 2>But the question is what does a shark </v>
<v Speaker 2>look like in a Dolphin's brain versus </v>

253
00:12:39.211 --> 00:12:41.440
<v Speaker 2>what it looks like in our brain?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

254
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:42.653
<v Speaker 2>it's probably quite different and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>really have no idea what a shark looks </v>

255
00:12:44.881 --> 00:12:45.714
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two adults,</v>

256
00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:46.853
<v Speaker 2>but I do know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there really are shirts and they really </v>

257
00:12:48.361 --> 00:12:49.194
<v Speaker 2>have sharp things on one end and a tail </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the other and they're eating </v>

258
00:12:51.661 --> 00:12:54.640
<v Speaker 2>machines and you should avoid them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

259
00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:55.400
<v Speaker 2>that's awesome.</v>

260
00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.233
<v Speaker 1>So that's actually a weakness of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>icon claim I would say because it looks </v>

261
00:13:01.011 --> 00:13:03.140
<v Speaker 1>to me like here's the twist on it,</v>

262
00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:09.610
<v Speaker 1>what we see in our conscious experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our functional icons,</v>

263
00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:11.773
<v Speaker 1>but they were also low resolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations of the things that are </v>

264
00:13:14.871 --> 00:13:15.704
<v Speaker 1>actually there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that computer icons </v>

265
00:13:19.191 --> 00:13:22.370
<v Speaker 1>are low resolution representations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that are there.</v>

266
00:13:22.371 --> 00:13:23.204
<v Speaker 1>They're just functional icons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might be wrong about that because </v>

267
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:31.310
<v Speaker 1>because it's hard to to conjure up that </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis on the fly.</v>

268
00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:32.900
<v Speaker 1>But the trash can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

269
00:13:32.901 --> 00:13:33.734
<v Speaker 1>on your desktop is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a low resolution </v>

270
00:13:36.981 --> 00:13:37.814
<v Speaker 1>representations of an actual trashcan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a computer trash even though it </v>

271
00:13:41.061 --> 00:13:45.440
<v Speaker 1>functions the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I like the icon idea,</v>

272
00:13:45.441 --> 00:13:46.274
<v Speaker 1>but I think it misses some element of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual relationship between the </v>

273
00:13:49.371 --> 00:13:52.880
<v Speaker 1>perception and the reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We definitely see in low resolution,</v>

274
00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:57.010
<v Speaker 1>which is why we can stand animated </v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures like say the simpsons,</v>

275
00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:57.993
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

276
00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.590
<v Speaker 1>where everything is one extremely low </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolution,</v>

277
00:14:00.591 --> 00:14:01.424
<v Speaker 1>but that makes no functional difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>to us whatsoever and we definitely see </v>

278
00:14:04.821 --> 00:14:05.654
<v Speaker 1>and hear in low resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the resolution like what we see or </v>

279
00:14:08.751 --> 00:14:09.584
<v Speaker 1>something like instead of icons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're more like thumbnails that are </v>

280
00:14:12.501 --> 00:14:14.750
<v Speaker 1>functional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good analogy.</v>

281
00:14:14.751 --> 00:14:15.584
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I like it because the thumbnail </v>

282
00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:22.520
<v Speaker 1>thumbnail actually is an unbiased </v>
<v Speaker 1>sampling of the actual</v>

283
00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:24.750
<v Speaker 1>object,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

284
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Because a photograph is relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbiased sample of an object and you can</v>

285
00:14:28.711 --> 00:14:30.410
<v Speaker 1>compress it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

286
00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:34.740
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell it and what you're doing is</v>

287
00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:40.010
<v Speaker 1>blurring out distinctions between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're blurring out distinctions between</v>

288
00:14:40.051 --> 00:14:40.884
<v Speaker 1>different aspects of it without,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without losing the relationship between </v>

289
00:14:44.221 --> 00:14:45.750
<v Speaker 1>the parks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

290
00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:47.370
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all.</v>

291
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.560
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in a way much of science operates at</v>

292
00:14:50.561 --> 00:14:52.920
<v Speaker 2>a metaphorical level that string,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

293
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:53.833
<v Speaker 2>have you ever seen a string theory </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary that didn't have violence </v>

294
00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.220
<v Speaker 2>featured in it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that,</v>

295
00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:00.680
<v Speaker 2>that the compute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that brain is like a computer.</v>

296
00:15:00.681 --> 00:15:03.920
<v Speaker 2>It's like a dual processor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like quantum information,</v>

297
00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:05.523
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't because we have to talk and we </v>

298
00:15:07.941 --> 00:15:11.840
<v Speaker 2>have to transfer the literal meaning of </v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphors to move something from here to</v>

299
00:15:11.841 --> 00:15:14.060
<v Speaker 2>there in the original Greek.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

300
00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to capture some idea that's</v>

301
00:15:16.881 --> 00:15:17.714
<v Speaker 2>really hard to get that buy something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're very familiar with some part of </v>

302
00:15:21.941 --> 00:15:22.774
<v Speaker 2>the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had two that addresses some of the </v>

303
00:15:24.051 --> 00:15:25.550
<v Speaker 2>issues you've dealt with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

304
00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:26.413
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with some of your recent conversations </v>

305
00:15:29.031 --> 00:15:31.820
<v Speaker 2>with people as we're operating at </v>
<v Speaker 2>different levels.</v>

306
00:15:31.821 --> 00:15:34.040
<v Speaker 2>So with Deepak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

307
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.560
<v Speaker 2>pounds me with articles about quantum </v>
<v Speaker 2>physics,</v>

308
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:37.890
<v Speaker 2>so you don't.</v>

309
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:39.583
<v Speaker 2>Material stuff is really just energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Atoms are mostly empty space and so </v>

310
00:15:43.911 --> 00:15:44.810
<v Speaker 2>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

311
00:15:44.811 --> 00:15:45.644
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this table is actually mostly empty </v>

312
00:15:47.631 --> 00:15:49.730
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all true,</v>

313
00:15:49.731 --> 00:15:50.564
<v Speaker 2>but we don't live at the quantum level </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the federal level where I'm sitting </v>

314
00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:57.200
<v Speaker 2>in a chair and I'm not passing through </v>
<v Speaker 2>it because at that,</v>

315
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:58.490
<v Speaker 2>at this level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

316
00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:03.500
<v Speaker 2>it's not the same as the quantum level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think making that distinction,</v>

317
00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:04.460
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

318
00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:08.300
<v Speaker 2>helps clarify a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like when you talk about the truth to</v>

319
00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:13.210
<v Speaker 2>be found in a biblical stories are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or literary stories like dusty Eskie or,</v>

320
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:17.750
<v Speaker 2>or Shakespeare or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a material scientist says,</v>

321
00:16:17.751 --> 00:16:18.501
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

322
00:16:18.501 --> 00:16:21.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean something different by truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that one of you is right,</v>

323
00:16:21.771 --> 00:16:22.604
<v Speaker 2>the other's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just that these are different </v>

324
00:16:23.331 --> 00:16:26.680
<v Speaker 2>levels or different ways of talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

325
00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Think about them as different tool kits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that.</v>

326
00:16:31.451 --> 00:16:32.540
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Different toolkits.</v>

327
00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:33.403
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

328
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Classic American pragmatist is that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of these things as tools.</v>

329
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:41.820
<v Speaker 1>There's a scientific tool kit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

330
00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.350
<v Speaker 1>there's a tool kit for action in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and they overlap,</v>

331
00:16:45.351 --> 00:16:46.340
<v Speaker 1>but they're not the same.</v>

332
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:49.390
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call this,</v>

333
00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:51.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elvis error,</v>

334
00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:54.900
<v Speaker 2>alvie singer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that character in woody Allen's film.</v>

335
00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:56.123
<v Speaker 2>I'm Annie Hall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's that funny scene where </v>

336
00:16:59.060 --> 00:16:59.893
<v Speaker 2>there's a flashback that where he's in </v>
<v Speaker 2>childhood and he's refused to do his </v>

337
00:17:03.331 --> 00:17:04.164
<v Speaker 2>homework and he's depressed and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother takes him to the doctor or </v>

338
00:17:06.121 --> 00:17:07.440
<v Speaker 2>psychiatrist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever he is.</v>

339
00:17:07.441 --> 00:17:08.360
<v Speaker 2>And okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

340
00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:09.510
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you depressed?</v>

341
00:17:09.511 --> 00:17:12.690
<v Speaker 2>Alberice is because I found out that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>universe is expanding.</v>

342
00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:15.810
<v Speaker 2>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if the universe is expanding and</v>

343
00:17:15.811 --> 00:17:18.630
<v Speaker 2>then eventually it's all gonna blow up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and nothing means anything.</v>

344
00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.550
<v Speaker 2>Other names,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adam?</v>

345
00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:24.760
<v Speaker 2>We live in Brooklyn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brooklyn's not expanding hallmark.</v>

346
00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:29.140
<v Speaker 1>That's a nice observation I think too </v>
<v Speaker 1>because.</v>

347
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:30.250
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

348
00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:32.520
<v Speaker 1>Let's go back to the conceptualization </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>

349
00:17:32.521 --> 00:17:34.660
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that we've agreed </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

350
00:17:34.661 --> 00:17:35.494
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want to lose track of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thread because I think it's useful is </v>

351
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:42.830
<v Speaker 1>that we do see an iconic reality and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>icons have practical utility,</v>

352
00:17:43.301 --> 00:17:44.134
<v Speaker 1>but they also bear some one to one </v>
<v Speaker 1>correspondence with the thing in itself </v>

353
00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:51.210
<v Speaker 1>and it's low resolution is a nice way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about.</v>

354
00:17:51.211 --> 00:17:53.940
<v Speaker 1>So they're low resolution icons with </v>
<v Speaker 1>functional utility.</v>

355
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:58.980
<v Speaker 1>Now the question would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then that makes clear is that without</v>

356
00:17:58.981 --> 00:18:02.420
<v Speaker 1>human consciousness all that disappears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

357
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:03.683
<v Speaker 1>Then the question is partly what is </v>
<v Speaker 1>there outside of that functional iconic </v>

358
00:18:08.581 --> 00:18:09.414
<v Speaker 1>representation and so that would be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>old question of the thing in itself and </v>

359
00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:13.283
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think you could say with some </v>

360
00:18:14.821 --> 00:18:19.821
<v Speaker 1>justification that the thing in itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>is in potential something that collapses</v>

361
00:18:20.101 --> 00:18:24.300
<v Speaker 1>across time and space so that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and nothing at the same time,</v>

362
00:18:24.301 --> 00:18:26.850
<v Speaker 1>which is I guess that's an eastern </v>
<v Speaker 1>claim.</v>

363
00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:27.683
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a Dallas claim and I like it </v>

364
00:18:30.211 --> 00:18:34.160
<v Speaker 1>because the problem with the or one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the issues that,</v>

365
00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.510
<v Speaker 1>and this is associated with the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn.</v>

366
00:18:36.511 --> 00:18:41.511
<v Speaker 1>It's not only does lb lb or lv lv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only does healthy live in Brooklyn,</v>

367
00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.620
<v Speaker 1>he lives in Brooklyn now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

368
00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:47.493
<v Speaker 1>And so it's spatially located and </v>
<v Speaker 1>temporarily located and so his mother's </v>

369
00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.920
<v Speaker 1>objection is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

370
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:56.660
<v Speaker 1>don't pick a reference point that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything right now irrelevant,</v>

371
00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:57.953
<v Speaker 1>which I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really good practical </v>

372
00:18:58.831 --> 00:18:59.664
<v Speaker 1>psychological advice because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that leads people down the path </v>

373
00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:03.684
<v Speaker 1>of nihilism is this claim that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>observation that you can pick a time </v>

374
00:19:07.361 --> 00:19:10.680
<v Speaker 1>frame of analysis that makes your </v>
<v Speaker 1>current action useless.</v>

375
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to care in a million years?</v>

376
00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:17.310
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that argues it,</v>

377
00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without God,</v>

378
00:19:18.481 --> 00:19:22.590
<v Speaker 2>without some sort of external source for</v>
<v Speaker 2>morality and meaning nothing,</v>

379
00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.920
<v Speaker 2>nothing we do matters because in $15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million years,</v>

380
00:19:25.921 --> 00:19:26.754
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the heat death of the universe or </v>

381
00:19:27.811 --> 00:19:30.360
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't live 15 billion years from now,</v>

382
00:19:30.361 --> 00:19:33.720
<v Speaker 2>we live now here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what we do does matter,</v>

383
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:34.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

384
00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.890
<v Speaker 2>so thesis would argue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

385
00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:40.470
<v Speaker 2>the theodicy problem without God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no right or wrong,</v>

386
00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:44.910
<v Speaker 2>whatever Stalin did or Hitler did is </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly fine because of the heat death</v>

387
00:19:44.911 --> 00:19:45.750
<v Speaker 2>of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

388
00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:46.584
<v Speaker 2>it's not fine because the people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are suffering in the Gulag archipelago </v>

389
00:19:49.771 --> 00:19:50.604
<v Speaker 2>or in the gas chambers at Auschwitz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not thinking about 15 billion </v>

390
00:19:54.241 --> 00:19:55.074
<v Speaker 2>years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're living right here and right now </v>

391
00:19:56.491 --> 00:20:00.060
<v Speaker 2>the torture is really doing wrong by </v>
<v Speaker 2>these standards.</v>

392
00:20:00.061 --> 00:20:00.894
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the level at which we're talking about </v>

393
00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.473
<v Speaker 2>is everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is why in the heavens on earth </v>

394
00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:07.163
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm concerned about the obsession with </v>

395
00:20:08.671 --> 00:20:11.340
<v Speaker 2>the people obsessing too much about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>afterlife.</v>

396
00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.770
<v Speaker 2>Not just religious people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but scientists.</v>

397
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.390
<v Speaker 2>So what I call it at the afterlife or </v>
<v Speaker 2>atheist,</v>

398
00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:18.243
<v Speaker 2>this is the core of my book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is really about all the cryonics people </v>

399
00:20:22.291 --> 00:20:25.980
<v Speaker 2>in the transhumanists and the singular </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tarion's and the extropians and the,</v>

400
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:27.583
<v Speaker 2>and the people that are gonna Upload </v>
<v Speaker 2>your mind into a computer and turn it </v>

401
00:20:30.211 --> 00:20:31.140
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

402
00:20:31.141 --> 00:20:32.850
<v Speaker 2>ray Kurzweil and all these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

403
00:20:32.851 --> 00:20:33.684
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're almost gurus when you go to </v>

404
00:20:34.741 --> 00:20:35.820
<v Speaker 2>these conferences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

405
00:20:35.821 --> 00:20:36.654
<v Speaker 2>it's like we get to live forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are the generation that gets to live </v>

406
00:20:39.031 --> 00:20:39.864
<v Speaker 2>for</v>

407
00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:41.243
<v Speaker 1>some of them think they're the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the generation that's going to </v>

408
00:20:43.111 --> 00:20:47.100
<v Speaker 1>instantiate the daily in the form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>computational entity as well.</v>

409
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:48.210
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

410
00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:50.320
<v Speaker 2>Kurzweil even as a funny line about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

411
00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.380
<v Speaker 2>is there a god?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

412
00:20:52.381 --> 00:20:54.940
<v Speaker 2>if there's going to be pretty soon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as we hit the singularity</v>

413
00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:01.200
<v Speaker 2>singularity assignments and it reminds </v>
<v Speaker 2>me of what I was religious.</v>

414
00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to be an evangelical.</v>

415
00:21:02.801 --> 00:21:07.210
<v Speaker 2>I went to Pepperdine University,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a Church of Christ school.</v>

416
00:21:07.211 --> 00:21:10.690
<v Speaker 2>I was really into it and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and going to church and all that stuff,</v>

417
00:21:10.691 --> 00:21:12.470
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go to the singularity summit.</v>

418
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.121
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

419
00:21:13.121 --> 00:21:13.954
<v Speaker 2>I'm back in church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's Ray Kurzweil grew up there </v>

420
00:21:16.841 --> 00:21:21.770
<v Speaker 2>telling us we are the first generation </v>
<v Speaker 2>that will live forever and you know,</v>

421
00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:23.830
<v Speaker 2>operate a gray,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this radical life extension.</v>

422
00:21:23.831 --> 00:21:24.621
<v Speaker 2>The scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

423
00:21:24.621 --> 00:21:25.454
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's on record saying the first person </v>

424
00:21:26.531 --> 00:21:30.370
<v Speaker 2>to live a thousand years is born now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this alive now?</v>

425
00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:31.283
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's two elements to the heaven </v>

426
00:21:33.721 --> 00:21:34.554
<v Speaker 1>issue that we can discuss them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one is the belief in the existence </v>

427
00:21:37.621 --> 00:21:42.380
<v Speaker 1>of heaven and the other is the positing </v>
<v Speaker 1>of heaven as an Ame.</v>

428
00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:45.570
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are interestingly related.</v>

429
00:21:45.571 --> 00:21:46.404
<v Speaker 1>So from my perspective from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things as far as I'd been </v>

430
00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:50.843
<v Speaker 1>able to tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that allows us to </v>

431
00:21:53.011 --> 00:21:53.844
<v Speaker 1>transform the reality that's too </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated to perceive into these </v>

432
00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:58.913
<v Speaker 1>functional low resolution icon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say is the name have to aim </v>

433
00:22:03.481 --> 00:22:05.220
<v Speaker 1>right and you have to aim with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>

434
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:06.063
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're also extraordinarily good at </v>

435
00:22:07.381 --> 00:22:10.140
<v Speaker 1>detecting how other people aim with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their eyes.</v>

436
00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:15.810
<v Speaker 1>So the question is always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

437
00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.320
<v Speaker 1>where should you a?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the answer to that archetype,</v>

438
00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.000
<v Speaker 1>I would say biologically for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter,</v>

439
00:22:21.001 --> 00:22:24.060
<v Speaker 1>is that you should aim up because why </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hell would you aim down?</v>

440
00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:27.030
<v Speaker 1>Down is hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right down is where the suffering is,</v>

441
00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:27.983
<v Speaker 1>down is where the malevolence is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you aim up and architecturally op is </v>

442
00:22:32.101 --> 00:22:35.370
<v Speaker 1>heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that I can't,</v>

443
00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:36.573
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that there's some </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility that it was impossible for </v>

444
00:22:39.451 --> 00:22:40.284
<v Speaker 1>human beings to discover the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something that we seem to have </v>

445
00:22:43.111 --> 00:22:43.944
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that was prefrontal extension </v>

446
00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:48.210
<v Speaker 1>ended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the expansion of the prefrontal</v>

447
00:22:48.211 --> 00:22:49.044
<v Speaker 1>cortex and its deep wiring with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>visual cortex that actually enabled us </v>

448
00:22:52.261 --> 00:22:54.390
<v Speaker 1>to foresee the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

449
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:57.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you can foresee the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future without,</v>

450
00:22:57.690 --> 00:22:58.523
<v Speaker 1>without stumbling upon the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>heaven at the same time because having </v>

451
00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:08.460
<v Speaker 1>that sense becomes the best possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>future and you're aiming at,</v>

452
00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:09.563
<v Speaker 1>you're aiming at a better future and </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're ending out a better </v>

453
00:23:12.001 --> 00:23:12.834
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of compelled to also </v>

454
00:23:14.251 --> 00:23:16.200
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle,</v>

455
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:21.480
<v Speaker 1>like the platonic ideal of the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then that future potential starts</v>

456
00:23:21.691 --> 00:23:24.360
<v Speaker 1>to become a kind of a reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

457
00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:26.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a super good point.</v>

458
00:23:26.591 --> 00:23:27.241
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

459
00:23:27.241 --> 00:23:28.074
<v Speaker 2>my concern about obsessing too much </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the next life is you're going to </v>

460
00:23:31.561 --> 00:23:34.290
<v Speaker 2>miss out on this life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is where you live right now.</v>

461
00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:35.670
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

462
00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:37.830
<v Speaker 2>but that's different from aiming at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

463
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:39.990
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a book on moral progress,</v>

464
00:23:39.991 --> 00:23:41.040
<v Speaker 2>the moral arc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

465
00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:44.850
<v Speaker 2>aiming for incremental improvements in </v>
<v Speaker 2>civil rights,</v>

466
00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.260
<v Speaker 2>health and longevity and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

467
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:50.100
<v Speaker 2>and ridding ourselves of disease and </v>
<v Speaker 2>war.</v>

468
00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:50.963
<v Speaker 2>These are all admirable goals and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>should keep doing that aiming for </v>

469
00:23:53.781 --> 00:23:56.930
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I do like the metaphor of it is,</v>

470
00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:01.130
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's because we're a social </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchical species.</v>

471
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:01.731
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

472
00:24:01.731 --> 00:24:04.370
<v Speaker 1>I think that's why the pyramids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that.</v>

473
00:24:04.371 --> 00:24:06.500
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what the pyramids </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent with her,</v>

474
00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.000
<v Speaker 1>with her gold cap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

475
00:24:08.001 --> 00:24:08.550
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

476
00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:09.770
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

477
00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.280
<v Speaker 1>and the Washington monument is the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

478
00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:13.123
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

479
00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:17.140
<v Speaker 2>Or The pyramid of hierarchy of needs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so on.</v>

480
00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:23.020
<v Speaker 2>At the end of my chapter on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a model theisms versions of Heaven,</v>

481
00:24:23.021 --> 00:24:23.854
<v Speaker 2>I float the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably won't be accepted by </v>

482
00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:27.920
<v Speaker 2>evangelicals and fundamentalists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was,</v>

483
00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:28.813
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Jesus talked about the kingdom is </v>

484
00:24:30.551 --> 00:24:33.810
<v Speaker 2>within,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned this,</v>

485
00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:34.653
<v Speaker 2>not as not as often as I would've liked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think he's referring to the fact </v>

486
00:24:38.141 --> 00:24:38.974
<v Speaker 2>that heaven is within us in the sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we should be aiming to improve </v>

487
00:24:42.311 --> 00:24:43.640
<v Speaker 2>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

488
00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:44.593
<v Speaker 2>that Christians have an atheist of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflicted over this passage where he </v>

489
00:24:47.621 --> 00:24:49.330
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

490
00:24:49.331 --> 00:24:50.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matthew Sixteen,</v>

491
00:24:50.441 --> 00:24:51.940
<v Speaker 2>Twenty six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say unto you,</v>

492
00:24:51.941 --> 00:24:52.774
<v Speaker 2>there are some standing here which will </v>
<v Speaker 2>not taste death until they see the son </v>

493
00:24:55.091 --> 00:24:57.280
<v Speaker 2>of man coming in his kingdom and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

494
00:24:57.281 --> 00:24:58.430
<v Speaker 2>of course atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ha,</v>

495
00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:01.100
<v Speaker 2>he's still not here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

496
00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:03.610
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what if he meant something else that</v>

497
00:25:03.611 --> 00:25:06.190
<v Speaker 2>happened is not a place to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a way to be here.</v>

498
00:25:06.191 --> 00:25:06.830
<v Speaker 2>And now I'm</v>

499
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:07.663
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very,</v>

500
00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:09.573
<v Speaker 1>what would you call?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not so viewpoint that I think is </v>

501
00:25:11.591 --> 00:25:13.690
<v Speaker 1>very much worth pursuing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would also.</v>

502
00:25:13.691 --> 00:25:16.720
<v Speaker 1>But I also think there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply strange about that too,</v>

503
00:25:16.721 --> 00:25:17.554
<v Speaker 1>because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that if a psychological state </v>

504
00:25:22.361 --> 00:25:25.120
<v Speaker 1>becomes profound enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starts to become a social state.</v>

505
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:28.720
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say that that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Kingdom of God that's within,</v>

506
00:25:28.721 --> 00:25:30.430
<v Speaker 1>which is something tolstoy wrote a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

507
00:25:30.431 --> 00:25:33.190
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a book that he wrote,</v>

508
00:25:33.191 --> 00:25:36.550
<v Speaker 1>a book called the Kingdom of God is </v>
<v Speaker 1>within us and that profoundly influenced</v>

509
00:25:36.551 --> 00:25:37.384
<v Speaker 1>Mahatma Gandhi by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they had lengthy correspondence </v>

510
00:25:39.191 --> 00:25:41.640
<v Speaker 1>which was part of the reason that Gandhi</v>
<v Speaker 1>became an unknown.</v>

511
00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:46.630
<v Speaker 1>Use nonviolent resistance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right in his fight against the English.</v>

512
00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:49.430
<v Speaker 1>It's was quite interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that there is.</v>

513
00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:52.780
<v Speaker 1>There is</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

514
00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:58.180
<v Speaker 1>It's something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe when you go to a concert,</v>

515
00:25:58.181 --> 00:25:59.014
<v Speaker 1>it's a great concert and you're having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very profound psychological experience </v>

516
00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:02.763
<v Speaker 1>of unity and harmony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of course is what you get into </v>

517
00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.330
<v Speaker 1>concert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if the experience is profound enough</v>

518
00:26:07.331 --> 00:26:08.164
<v Speaker 1>psychologically and individually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also starts to encompass and envelop </v>

519
00:26:11.681 --> 00:26:12.640
<v Speaker 1>the people around you.</v>

520
00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:14.043
<v Speaker 1>And so I think the Kingdom of God that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ was talking about with something </v>

521
00:26:16.721 --> 00:26:18.670
<v Speaker 1>like this is why I like jumped piaget so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

522
00:26:18.671 --> 00:26:19.504
<v Speaker 1>It's something like the pig and </v>
<v Speaker 1>equilibrated state where things are </v>

523
00:26:22.121 --> 00:26:22.954
<v Speaker 1>working out really well for you when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're deeply immersed in a meaningful </v>

524
00:26:25.361 --> 00:26:27.460
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>

525
00:26:27.461 --> 00:26:28.294
<v Speaker 1>that meeting is structured so that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>maximally beneficial for the people who </v>

526
00:26:31.151 --> 00:26:35.410
<v Speaker 1>are immediately around you and for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are distantly related to you.</v>

527
00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:38.370
<v Speaker 1>And so everything stacks up and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's some.</v>

528
00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.273
<v Speaker 1>That's something like the idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ladder to have under the stairway to </v>

529
00:26:41.801 --> 00:26:44.400
<v Speaker 1>heaven today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything stacking up properly.</v>

530
00:26:44.401 --> 00:26:46.530
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

531
00:26:46.531 --> 00:26:47.364
<v Speaker 1>I think when people experience that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where the metaphysics </v>

532
00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:52.250
<v Speaker 1>touches the material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that when people.</v>

533
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.750
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly that precisely dot yes,</v>

534
00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:55.643
<v Speaker 1>precisely that.</v>

535
00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:57.803
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you notice that the demons are </v>

536
00:26:58.711 --> 00:27:01.440
<v Speaker 1>upside down going down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

537
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:02.333
<v Speaker 1>Which is exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly the right way to </v>

538
00:27:04.171 --> 00:27:05.004
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that when people have an </v>

539
00:27:07.111 --> 00:27:07.944
<v Speaker 1>experience of that stacking of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they also have an intimation of </v>

540
00:27:13.261 --> 00:27:16.020
<v Speaker 1>immortality that goes along with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's embodied.</v>

541
00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.153
<v Speaker 1>And that that's partly why the </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical speculations about the </v>

542
00:27:19.741 --> 00:27:22.680
<v Speaker 1>reality of the Kingdom of Heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be merged because it's not just</v>

543
00:27:22.681 --> 00:27:23.514
<v Speaker 1>conceptual right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is embodied experience and people </v>

544
00:27:27.421 --> 00:27:28.254
<v Speaker 1>report the same thing when they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendental experiences of various </v>

545
00:27:30.691 --> 00:27:31.524
<v Speaker 1>sorts and those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we know from a scientific </v>

546
00:27:33.451 --> 00:27:34.284
<v Speaker 1>perspective that those can be very </v>
<v Speaker 1>reliably induced with the use of agents </v>

547
00:27:37.021 --> 00:27:37.854
<v Speaker 1>like psilocybin and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been really fascinated by what's </v>

548
00:27:40.891 --> 00:27:41.724
<v Speaker 1>been happening at Johns Hopkins Hospital</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the Psilocybin experimenters </v>

549
00:27:44.791 --> 00:27:45.624
<v Speaker 1>because one of the most recent things </v>
<v Speaker 1>they showed was that if you take people </v>

550
00:27:49.051 --> 00:27:49.884
<v Speaker 1>dying of cancer and you give them </v>
<v Speaker 1>psilocybin and they have a mystical </v>

551
00:27:53.281 --> 00:27:55.530
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something like an experience of</v>

552
00:27:55.531 --> 00:27:59.810
<v Speaker 1>the Kingdom of God on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also eternally at the same time that</v>

553
00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:03.100
<v Speaker 1>they lose their fear of death or that at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least it's much modified.</v>

554
00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a hell of a finding.</v>

555
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:07.050
<v Speaker 1>That's really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just,</v>

556
00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:08.153
<v Speaker 1>you can't just walk away from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>easily because that's a hell of a thing </v>

557
00:28:10.501 --> 00:28:11.334
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to treat.</v>

558
00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:13.043
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a chapter on that in heavens on </v>

559
00:28:15.491 --> 00:28:17.220
<v Speaker 2>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on near death experiences.</v>

560
00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:19.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

561
00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:20.460
<v Speaker 2>but we're talking about two different </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

562
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:21.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

563
00:28:21.561 --> 00:28:22.394
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the transitioning from life to death in </v>

564
00:28:25.231 --> 00:28:30.231
<v Speaker 2>the most pain free or anxiety reduced </v>
<v Speaker 2>state is more progress,</v>

565
00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:32.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>medical progress,</v>

566
00:28:32.221 --> 00:28:36.600
<v Speaker 2>psychological progress or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm all for Psilocybin,</v>

567
00:28:36.601 --> 00:28:39.540
<v Speaker 2>does it or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then great,</v>

568
00:28:39.541 --> 00:28:40.374
<v Speaker 2>we should do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of people that claim </v>

569
00:28:42.211 --> 00:28:43.044
<v Speaker 2>more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is opening the doors of </v>

570
00:28:44.911 --> 00:28:45.744
<v Speaker 2>perception into another world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually out there and that those </v>

571
00:28:49.891 --> 00:28:53.760
<v Speaker 2>of us who have not taken acid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just simply can't know.</v>

572
00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:57.600
<v Speaker 2>So now we now we get at this question of</v>
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>

573
00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:58.463
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of my columns and scientific </v>

574
00:29:00.331 --> 00:29:03.240
<v Speaker 2>American and I recently wrote called </v>
<v Speaker 2>what is truth anyway?</v>

575
00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:04.553
<v Speaker 2>I mean when I say like I prefer dark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark chocolate and you prefer milk </v>

576
00:29:08.161 --> 00:29:09.320
<v Speaker 2>chocolate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

577
00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:10.860
<v Speaker 2>there is no truth.</v>

578
00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:14.220
<v Speaker 2>That is to be discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Years is true for you mind street for me</v>

579
00:29:14.221 --> 00:29:15.054
<v Speaker 2>or I say stairway to heaven is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest rock song of all time and you </v>

580
00:29:17.581 --> 00:29:17.911
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

581
00:29:17.911 --> 00:29:18.744
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freebird is better than stairway to </v>

582
00:29:19.891 --> 00:29:21.540
<v Speaker 2>heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we argue about that,</v>

583
00:29:21.541 --> 00:29:22.374
<v Speaker 2>but there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no experiment we're going to </v>

584
00:29:23.371 --> 00:29:24.204
<v Speaker 2>run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so as we start to move along these </v>

585
00:29:26.521 --> 00:29:27.354
<v Speaker 2>lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when Deepak Chopra tells me </v>

586
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.720
<v Speaker 2>meditation works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

587
00:29:30.721 --> 00:29:34.110
<v Speaker 2>so if it works for you or it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>work for me,</v>

588
00:29:34.111 --> 00:29:34.944
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are still in that state of </v>

589
00:29:35.791 --> 00:29:36.624
<v Speaker 2>internal truths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what we want to know in sciences </v>

590
00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:39.723
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or 67 percent of people that do an hour </v>

591
00:29:43.001 --> 00:29:43.834
<v Speaker 2>of meditation a day under these </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions have reduced stress hormones </v>

592
00:29:47.921 --> 00:29:48.754
<v Speaker 2>and blood pressure and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some measurable way that's different </v>

593
00:29:51.641 --> 00:29:53.560
<v Speaker 2>than just an internal state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

594
00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we're talking about,</v>

595
00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.313
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just working on Torque for striving to </v>

596
00:29:58.901 --> 00:30:02.260
<v Speaker 2>better ourselves or some kind of heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you mean just,</v>

597
00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:03.593
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphorically so that I can better </v>

598
00:30:05.351 --> 00:30:06.184
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's different than there's an actual </v>

599
00:30:07.991 --> 00:30:11.920
<v Speaker 2>place you can go to a that's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>there after we die.</v>

600
00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:16.210
<v Speaker 2>And so I think this is where scientists </v>
<v Speaker 2>go on way.</v>

601
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:20.980
<v Speaker 1>You also start messing about with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of place in a way that,</v>

602
00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:22.063
<v Speaker 1>that that's the problem with having </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussions about fundamental realities </v>

603
00:30:24.401 --> 00:30:25.234
<v Speaker 1>and know when you said another thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Christ said was the Kingdom of </v>

604
00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Heaven is spread upon Earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But men do not see it and that's,</v>

605
00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:35.980
<v Speaker 1>that's something that's akin to the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Kingdom of God is within you,</v>

606
00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:36.873
<v Speaker 1>although it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a strange twist on it because it </v>

607
00:30:39.161 --> 00:30:39.994
<v Speaker 1>also adds an element of externality or </v>
<v Speaker 1>physicality to it and an element of </v>

608
00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:44.733
<v Speaker 1>immediacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not something that's forestalled into </v>

609
00:30:46.181 --> 00:30:48.100
<v Speaker 1>the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wonder,</v>

610
00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.800
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my wild or moments of speculation,</v>

611
00:30:50.801 --> 00:30:55.600
<v Speaker 1>I have this notion that if things stack </v>
<v Speaker 1>up properly,</v>

612
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.823
<v Speaker 1>so imagine that you're immersed in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very deeply meaningful experience and </v>

613
00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:02.290
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's operating.</v>

614
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:03.303
<v Speaker 1>It's indicating that harmony has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>established between multiple levels of </v>

615
00:31:05.981 --> 00:31:08.470
<v Speaker 1>being simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that can.</v>

616
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:13.360
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that can put you in a place </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's profound enough or deep enough so</v>

617
00:31:13.361 --> 00:31:17.050
<v Speaker 1>that the structure of time and space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it still starts to warp around that.</v>

618
00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:19.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that that's A.</v>

619
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.160
<v Speaker 1>I can't formulate that well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's something.</v>

620
00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:25.053
<v Speaker 1>There's something about it that seems to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me to be correct about that because </v>

621
00:31:27.401 --> 00:31:31.660
<v Speaker 1>people have intimations of immortality </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have intimations of,</v>

622
00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.750
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of heavenly and hellish abodes as well,</v>

623
00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:36.400
<v Speaker 1>and they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not.</v>

624
00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:39.190
<v Speaker 1>They're not the simple kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrational,</v>

625
00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:40.403
<v Speaker 1>even rational fundamentalist beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 1>that often people talk about when </v>

626
00:31:42.941 --> 00:31:43.774
<v Speaker 1>they're discussing religious belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are more reflected in direct </v>

627
00:31:46.091 --> 00:31:48.370
<v Speaker 1>experience and it's not easy to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of them.</v>

628
00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:50.133
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you delve into the literature on </v>

629
00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.113
<v Speaker 2>Judaism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity and Islam and their </v>

630
00:31:53.231 --> 00:31:56.860
<v Speaker 2>versions of the afterlife and heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're quite different and the Jews are</v>

631
00:31:56.861 --> 00:32:00.160
<v Speaker 2>far less obsessed with going some place </v>
<v Speaker 2>after death.</v>

632
00:32:00.161 --> 00:32:01.670
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>originally they had,</v>

633
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:03.790
<v Speaker 2>they were going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no place at all.</v>

634
00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:04.803
<v Speaker 2>Show was just nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just he returned to where you </v>

635
00:32:06.851 --> 00:32:09.310
<v Speaker 2>were before you were alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just no place,</v>

636
00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

637
00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.780
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that religion is far more focused on the</v>

638
00:32:13.781 --> 00:32:16.780
<v Speaker 2>here and now we have a moral duty to </v>
<v Speaker 2>help people,</v>

639
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:17.703
<v Speaker 2>the poor and so on now and to live </v>
<v Speaker 2>better lives and more lives of dignity </v>

640
00:32:21.851 --> 00:32:26.851
<v Speaker 2>and honor and now and Christianity </v>
<v Speaker 2>really started off more like that.</v>

641
00:32:27.551 --> 00:32:28.384
<v Speaker 2>Then kind of morphed over the centuries </v>
<v Speaker 2>and particularly in fundamentalist and </v>

642
00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:35.470
<v Speaker 2>evangelicals in the 20th century toward </v>
<v Speaker 2>this place we're to go</v>

643
00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:38.470
<v Speaker 2>after we die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

644
00:32:38.471 --> 00:32:39.304
<v Speaker 2>You kind of had the schism in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity today between the kind of </v>

645
00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:43.373
<v Speaker 2>the fundamentalists that are constantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about the afterlife and </v>

646
00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.760
<v Speaker 2>accepting Jesus and they're focused on </v>
<v Speaker 2>missionary,</v>

647
00:32:49.761 --> 00:32:50.594
<v Speaker 2>working in diverting people versus say </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the Rick Warren's of the world </v>

648
00:32:53.511 --> 00:32:58.020
<v Speaker 2>that want to put their money into a soup</v>
<v Speaker 2>kitchens and helping the poor and,</v>

649
00:32:58.021 --> 00:32:58.530
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

650
00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:03.530
<v Speaker 2>and Christians have a moral duty to help</v>
<v Speaker 2>those in need and not so much focused on</v>

651
00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:06.360
<v Speaker 2>the next life.</v>

652
00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:08.511
<v Speaker 1>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

653
00:33:08.511 --> 00:33:09.344
<v Speaker 1>because there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are real dangers associated with </v>

654
00:33:10.911 --> 00:33:11.744
<v Speaker 1>both those kinds of conceptualizations </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean you alluded to one danger that was </v>

655
00:33:15.771 --> 00:33:16.604
<v Speaker 1>associated with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call those who are concerned more </v>

656
00:33:18.621 --> 00:33:21.470
<v Speaker 1>with the immediate present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the,</v>

657
00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.750
<v Speaker 1>that's starting to manifest itself in </v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

658
00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:24.673
<v Speaker 1>in these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

659
00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:26.680
<v Speaker 1>technological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immortal,</v>

660
00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:28.700
<v Speaker 1>immortalists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're saying,</v>

661
00:33:28.701 --> 00:33:29.534
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should transform the nature of being </v>

662
00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:32.293
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily radically right here and</v>
<v Speaker 1>now so that we have heaven in the </v>

663
00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:36.200
<v Speaker 1>mortality here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

664
00:33:36.201 --> 00:33:37.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we lose by doing that?</v>

665
00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:38.693
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a question that's worth </v>

666
00:33:40.071 --> 00:33:43.850
<v Speaker 1>asking because if we're trans human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we lose being human.</v>

667
00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.760
<v Speaker 1>And it may be that we actually don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to lose being human,</v>

668
00:33:46.761 --> 00:33:49.410
<v Speaker 1>even though being human means suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>and malevolent,</v>

669
00:33:49.411 --> 00:33:51.800
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very hard question.</v>

670
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:54.130
<v Speaker 1>But then the Christians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what we're.</v>

671
00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:56.810
<v Speaker 1>She went after the Christian since it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>such an hour.</v>

672
00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:57.733
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

673
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:58.783
<v Speaker 1>if you despise the current world and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave everything to be rectified in the </v>

674
00:34:03.621 --> 00:34:04.454
<v Speaker 1>afterlife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you just abandoned life itself and </v>

675
00:34:05.991 --> 00:34:09.460
<v Speaker 1>you're really traders to life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so how,</v>

676
00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:13.160
<v Speaker 1>how does steer through those to shoot </v>
<v Speaker 1>two shows,</v>

677
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:17.150
<v Speaker 1>let's say is thing or to cliff's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very difficult proposition.</v>

678
00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:20.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's my message in the book to,</v>

679
00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:21.643
<v Speaker 2>to the military and the cryonics and </v>
<v Speaker 2>transhumanism and so on is I'm glad </v>

680
00:34:26.951 --> 00:34:28.520
<v Speaker 2>you're working on this problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

681
00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:29.653
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or don't you want to live to be a </v>

682
00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.610
<v Speaker 2>thousand years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my response is look,</v>

683
00:34:33.611 --> 00:34:38.611
<v Speaker 2>just get me to 90 without cancer and 100</v>
<v Speaker 2>without Alzheimer's on 110 without being</v>

684
00:34:39.431 --> 00:34:41.500
<v Speaker 2>plugged into machines and lying in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bed.</v>

685
00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:42.753
<v Speaker 2>Because that's not a life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so and so I'm glad people are </v>

686
00:34:46.571 --> 00:34:48.400
<v Speaker 2>working on like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the best diet?</v>

687
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:52.900
<v Speaker 2>How much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What can we do to improve our memory and</v>

688
00:34:52.901 --> 00:34:53.734
<v Speaker 2>so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all great and I'm glad and I'm </v>

689
00:34:57.101 --> 00:35:00.190
<v Speaker 2>glad Kurzweil is now the chief engineer </v>
<v Speaker 2>of all Google.</v>

690
00:35:00.191 --> 00:35:02.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's got some resources to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something about this,</v>

691
00:35:02.561 --> 00:35:05.320
<v Speaker 2>but that this focus on living a thousand</v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

692
00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.193
<v Speaker 2>your first one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may miss that little incremental </v>

693
00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:11.350
<v Speaker 2>things we can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also you're missing out now.</v>

694
00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:15.850
<v Speaker 2>There's this fell on my right about in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the book I'm on Ray Kurzweil.</v>

695
00:35:15.851 --> 00:35:17.920
<v Speaker 2>It's a little kind of biographical film </v>
<v Speaker 2>of him.</v>

696
00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:22.120
<v Speaker 2>I'll transcendent man and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly talking about,</v>

697
00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.033
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>living forever and so on and he's </v>

698
00:35:24.521 --> 00:35:28.120
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with his father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His father died when he was 51,</v>

699
00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:29.603
<v Speaker 2>father was 50 ones and and ray was kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of missed out having a father figure </v>

700
00:35:33.581 --> 00:35:38.581
<v Speaker 2>because the father was always working </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Ray was a real entrepreneur achiever</v>

701
00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:40.103
<v Speaker 2>from his teenage years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he was always working and the film </v>

702
00:35:43.021 --> 00:35:43.854
<v Speaker 2>kind of follows him around collecting </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything he can about his father and </v>

703
00:35:46.111 --> 00:35:49.110
<v Speaker 2>he keeps it in the basement of his house</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he wants to resurrect his father and</v>

704
00:35:49.111 --> 00:35:50.810
<v Speaker 2>a computer and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

705
00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:51.653
<v Speaker 2>boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freud would have a field day with this </v>

706
00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:55.080
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's something,</v>

707
00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:58.330
<v Speaker 2>there's something going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This sort of rose focus on.</v>

708
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:59.703
<v Speaker 1>I see this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is strange dichotomy and attitude </v>

709
00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.393
<v Speaker 1>that you just described.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even characterizing use that in my own </v>

710
00:36:06.281 --> 00:36:11.020
<v Speaker 1>life because I'm very interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies that stave off aging,</v>

711
00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:12.003
<v Speaker 1>dietary manipulations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have this machine in my basement </v>

712
00:36:14.891 --> 00:36:15.724
<v Speaker 1>that's intense pulse light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>late intense pulse light machine that's </v>

713
00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:22.810
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable skin rejuvenator like it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>an absolute miracle.</v>

714
00:36:22.811 --> 00:36:25.620
<v Speaker 1>This machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it'll take,</v>

715
00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:28.750
<v Speaker 1>it'll take sun damage from your skin </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>

716
00:36:28.751 --> 00:36:30.400
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and force rejuvenation.</v>

717
00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:33.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like using photoshop on your skin.</v>

718
00:36:33.761 --> 00:36:35.500
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

719
00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:36.070
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

720
00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:37.330
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I think,</v>

721
00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:38.523
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it interesting to do everything </v>

722
00:36:39.941 --> 00:36:40.774
<v Speaker 1>possible to prolong youth in life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time there's another </v>

723
00:36:44.351 --> 00:36:47.380
<v Speaker 1>part of me that's thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

724
00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:52.600
<v Speaker 1>this is something I wrote about it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this new book that I'm publishing.</v>

725
00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:57.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm just thinking about socrates and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to accept his death.</v>

726
00:36:57.890 --> 00:36:58.723
<v Speaker 1>Knowing what socrates seems to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>revealed in his acceptance of his death </v>

727
00:37:02.201 --> 00:37:05.550
<v Speaker 1>was that if you live your life properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you,</v>

728
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:08.500
<v Speaker 1>you've maybe you've lived your life in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense,</v>

729
00:37:08.501 --> 00:37:10.450
<v Speaker 1>you've exhausted it in some sense.</v>

730
00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:14.530
<v Speaker 1>The question is if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you live the thousand years,</v>

731
00:37:14.531 --> 00:37:16.510
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly what,</v>

732
00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:19.450
<v Speaker 1>what exactly would you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

733
00:37:19.451 --> 00:37:22.300
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had kids and I loved having kids,</v>

734
00:37:22.301 --> 00:37:24.910
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't have them again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I wouldn't do that again,</v>

735
00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:27.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I have a grandchild and that's fine,</v>

736
00:37:27.821 --> 00:37:31.110
<v Speaker 1>but that's a new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've had a career and I,</v>

737
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:32.263
<v Speaker 1>as I get older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of having 10 more careers </v>

738
00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:39.460
<v Speaker 1>seems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like I'm not interested in it,</v>

739
00:37:39.461 --> 00:37:42.580
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't grip me the same way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have,</v>

740
00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:45.730
<v Speaker 1>say 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I wonder,</v>

741
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000
<v Speaker 1>like I wonder if it is the case that </v>
<v Speaker 1>life is in some sense structured so that</v>

742
00:37:51.701 --> 00:37:54.640
<v Speaker 1>its finitude as necessary and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that should be</v>

743
00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:58.300
<v Speaker 1>well casually transcended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say.</v>

744
00:37:58.990 --> 00:37:59.823
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the transhumanists would respond to </v>

745
00:38:00.781 --> 00:38:01.680
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

746
00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:05.220
<v Speaker 2>that you're just used to this idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>only living 80,</v>

747
00:38:05.221 --> 00:38:07.170
<v Speaker 2>90 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you're done,</v>

748
00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:08.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we would adjust to that.</v>

749
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:09.623
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe</v>

750
00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:15.000
<v Speaker 1>the question would be who would be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>weed that would adjust to that?</v>

751
00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would no longer okay to get there.</v>

752
00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:19.343
<v Speaker 2>We would no longer be human there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea of the transhumanist </v>

753
00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:24.800
<v Speaker 2>singularitarian people is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is truly,</v>

754
00:38:24.801 --> 00:38:26.690
<v Speaker 2>you're not human anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have brain,</v>

755
00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:32.090
<v Speaker 2>like the cochlear implant for hearing is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kind of brain transplant device.</v>

756
00:38:32.091 --> 00:38:32.924
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to ramp that up and put in </v>

757
00:38:35.471 --> 00:38:37.600
<v Speaker 2>your cortex and you'd hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sent centrally,</v>

758
00:38:37.601 --> 00:38:40.840
<v Speaker 2>have wikipedia in your brain and for </v>
<v Speaker 2>instant access and,</v>

759
00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:45.550
<v Speaker 2>and that it would truly bring new </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning to what it means to be human.</v>

760
00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:48.293
<v Speaker 1>You could also argue that that's a form </v>
<v Speaker 1>of death because if you transform </v>

761
00:38:51.751 --> 00:38:54.210
<v Speaker 1>yourself so radically that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>unrecognizable,</v>

762
00:38:54.211 --> 00:38:55.044
<v Speaker 1>then what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's the continuity with what you </v>

763
00:38:57.271 --> 00:38:58.860
<v Speaker 1>once were?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

764
00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:01.950
<v Speaker 1>this was one of the reasons I have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>real sympathy for many reasons.</v>

765
00:39:01.951 --> 00:39:02.784
<v Speaker 1>I have many reasons for this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of them that I have very much </v>

766
00:39:04.771 --> 00:39:05.970
<v Speaker 1>sympathy for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea,</v>

767
00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.073
<v Speaker 1>the Christian idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's that's associated with the </v>

768
00:39:09.181 --> 00:39:10.014
<v Speaker 1>mortality of the resurrection of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>body because the Christians insisted </v>

769
00:39:13.141 --> 00:39:16.010
<v Speaker 1>that this is not some sort of abstract </v>
<v Speaker 1>lights like it's.</v>

770
00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:16.873
<v Speaker 1>It's not uploaded into a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not blowing out all of your </v>

771
00:39:20.401 --> 00:39:21.980
<v Speaker 1>limitations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>

772
00:39:21.981 --> 00:39:22.814
<v Speaker 1>you might ask what the resurrected body </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be and of course that's a </v>

773
00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:27.330
<v Speaker 1>particularity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a perfectly fine question,</v>

774
00:39:27.331 --> 00:39:29.430
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>

775
00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:35.310
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't move you around.</v>

776
00:39:35.311 --> 00:39:36.144
<v Speaker 1>The fact that there was a question that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was really to be grappled with there </v>

777
00:39:38.881 --> 00:39:39.714
<v Speaker 1>because what the Christians were trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do was to have their taken either to </v>

778
00:39:42.871 --> 00:39:44.340
<v Speaker 1>in some sense and to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

779
00:39:44.341 --> 00:39:49.341
<v Speaker 1>there's some absolute utility to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>limitation that is imposed upon you by a</v>

780
00:39:49.831 --> 00:39:51.480
<v Speaker 1>mortal frame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

781
00:39:51.481 --> 00:39:52.314
<v Speaker 1>That's the characteristic element of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being human and that perhaps there's a </v>

782
00:39:54.961 --> 00:39:57.600
<v Speaker 1>way of having that in transcending it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time.</v>

783
00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:59.870
<v Speaker 1>Now what that would look like is </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously vitamins,</v>

784
00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:01.513
<v Speaker 2>deal with that and heavens on earth to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a chapter on the soul and post </v>

785
00:40:04.771 --> 00:40:05.604
<v Speaker 2>descartes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christians became more doulas before </v>

786
00:40:07.621 --> 00:40:08.454
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were more focused on the physical </v>

787
00:40:09.331 --> 00:40:10.164
<v Speaker 2>resurrection of the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are still some Christians today </v>

788
00:40:12.481 --> 00:40:14.880
<v Speaker 2>who think that they'll physically be </v>
<v Speaker 2>resurrected,</v>

789
00:40:14.881 --> 00:40:15.714
<v Speaker 2>but most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of them are journalists and it's </v>

790
00:40:17.291 --> 00:40:19.710
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just this kind of nonphysical thing</v>

791
00:40:19.711 --> 00:40:20.544
<v Speaker 2>that goes and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and be and is with God and Jesus and so </v>

792
00:40:23.521 --> 00:40:24.560
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

793
00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:25.310
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

794
00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:26.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they actually debate this</v>

795
00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:30.570
<v Speaker 2>question of identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with identity.</v>

796
00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:31.673
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

797
00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:33.840
<v Speaker 2>if you're physically resurrected in </v>
<v Speaker 2>heaven,</v>

798
00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:35.910
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's there?</v>

799
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:37.223
<v Speaker 2>How old are you get?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of them actually have an </v>

800
00:40:39.061 --> 00:40:39.930
<v Speaker 2>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're 30,</v>

801
00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:41.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like the ideal age physically,</v>

802
00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:46.030
<v Speaker 2>I suppose mentally and also Jesus was 30</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's</v>

803
00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:48.870
<v Speaker 2>maybe okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

804
00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:50.680
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then the question is,</v>

805
00:40:50.681 --> 00:40:51.514
<v Speaker 2>is an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I asked this question for the mindup </v>

806
00:40:53.821 --> 00:40:55.120
<v Speaker 2>loaders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the transhumanist,</v>

807
00:40:55.121 --> 00:40:58.490
<v Speaker 2>it's like there is no fixed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

808
00:40:58.491 --> 00:41:02.460
<v Speaker 2>all your cells in your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And almost all of the atoms in your body</v>

809
00:41:02.461 --> 00:41:03.294
<v Speaker 2>are recycled about every decade or so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there is no defined physical self of </v>

810
00:41:07.321 --> 00:41:07.950
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

811
00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:10.570
<v Speaker 2>the thesis ship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you replace all the wood and the ship,</v>

812
00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:11.633
<v Speaker 2>we still call it,</v>

813
00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:15.850
<v Speaker 1>of structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was Schrodinger's Turret,</v>

814
00:41:15.851 --> 00:41:16.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

815
00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.180
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

816
00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:17.681
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

817
00:41:17.681 --> 00:41:21.160
<v Speaker 2>So it's the pattern of information that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is your memories,</v>

818
00:41:21.161 --> 00:41:22.690
<v Speaker 2>your memory cells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>memory cells.</v>

819
00:41:22.691 --> 00:41:23.524
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

820
00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:24.401
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

821
00:41:24.401 --> 00:41:27.220
<v Speaker 2>That's better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at what age?</v>

822
00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:28.083
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I have memories now that I </v>

823
00:41:29.201 --> 00:41:30.034
<v Speaker 2>didn't have when I was 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what happens if I'm resurrected at </v>

824
00:41:32.201 --> 00:41:34.340
<v Speaker 2>age 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas all the memories of my last.</v>

825
00:41:34.341 --> 00:41:37.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm 63 now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so as 33 years of memories,</v>

826
00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:40.030
<v Speaker 2>I want those too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so does the.</v>

827
00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:40.873
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can have all those memories but </v>

828
00:41:41.691 --> 00:41:42.524
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the memories I have now at 63 of when I </v>

829
00:41:45.141 --> 00:41:45.974
<v Speaker 2>was 30 are very different than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>memories when I was 30 of what I was </v>

830
00:41:49.311 --> 00:41:52.910
<v Speaker 2>like at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there is no fixed set of memories</v>

831
00:41:52.911 --> 00:41:53.744
<v Speaker 2>even that represents you because those </v>
<v Speaker 2>are constantly edited and changed and </v>

832
00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:58.670
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

833
00:41:58.671 --> 00:41:59.504
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I understand when I had that 10 </v>

834
00:42:01.311 --> 00:42:03.830
<v Speaker 2>years as a bike racer in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 2>eighties,</v>

835
00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:04.731
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

836
00:42:04.731 --> 00:42:05.564
<v Speaker 2>I was just sort of going through and </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing my thing and now I see in context </v>

837
00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:09.560
<v Speaker 2>what that meant for my life.</v>

838
00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:12.860
<v Speaker 2>But I didn't know it at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true for everything we do.</v>

839
00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.113
<v Speaker 2>That's why I was laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People write memoirs in their twenties </v>

840
00:42:15.861 --> 00:42:16.694
<v Speaker 2>or thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

841
00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:19.190
<v Speaker 2>how can you write a memoir?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have no idea what you're doing</v>

842
00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:22.820
<v Speaker 2>now is going to be in 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in religious.</v>

843
00:42:22.821 --> 00:42:23.654
<v Speaker 2>So both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both scientific attempts at immortality </v>

844
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.070
<v Speaker 2>or the afterlife or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And religious,</v>

845
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:29.590
<v Speaker 2>they have the same problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

846
00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:32.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is up there that's been resurrected</v>

847
00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:33.253
<v Speaker 2>because there is no fixed self.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a constantly dynamic changing </v>

848
00:42:35.601 --> 00:42:38.090
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's one more problem.</v>

849
00:42:38.091 --> 00:42:40.280
<v Speaker 2>That idea with the point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>self appeal of these cells.</v>

850
00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:41.061
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

851
00:42:41.061 --> 00:42:45.080
<v Speaker 2>you and I looking out through your eyes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Jordan go to sleep tonight.</v>

852
00:42:45.081 --> 00:42:47.390
<v Speaker 2>You wake up tomorrow morning and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>groggy for a few minutes,</v>

853
00:42:47.391 --> 00:42:48.224
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your,</v>

854
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:52.340
<v Speaker 2>your point of view returns and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the singularity people,</v>

855
00:42:52.341 --> 00:42:52.791
<v Speaker 2>they think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

856
00:42:52.791 --> 00:42:53.624
<v Speaker 2>we'll copy all your memories and put </v>
<v Speaker 2>them in a computer and then we'll turn </v>

857
00:42:56.211 --> 00:42:58.970
<v Speaker 2>it on and you'll wake up and you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be looking out through the little</v>

858
00:42:58.971 --> 00:42:59.600
<v Speaker 2>camera hold.</v>

859
00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:01.460
<v Speaker 2>They're like Johnny Depp in </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendence.</v>

860
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:03.230
<v Speaker 2>And you'll be in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

861
00:43:03.231 --> 00:43:04.064
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would your point of view all of a </v>

862
00:43:06.801 --> 00:43:07.634
<v Speaker 2>sudden leap from your current body into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the computer in the same sense that </v>

863
00:43:11.451 --> 00:43:15.050
<v Speaker 2>instead of sacrificing your brain and </v>
<v Speaker 2>slicing it up and scanning,</v>

864
00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:18.230
<v Speaker 2>this is the current thoughts scanning </v>
<v Speaker 2>every synapse.</v>

865
00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:19.453
<v Speaker 2>What if in a hundred years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had a sophisticated MRI machine that </v>

866
00:43:22.331 --> 00:43:26.330
<v Speaker 2>could scan your brain and scan every </v>
<v Speaker 2>single synapse and reproduce it,</v>

867
00:43:26.331 --> 00:43:29.240
<v Speaker 2>and we had a computer big enough with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Moore's law doubling and so on.</v>

868
00:43:29.241 --> 00:43:30.074
<v Speaker 2>It would be enough to just reproduced </v>
<v Speaker 2>your entire connectome and turned it on </v>

869
00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:35.120
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

870
00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:35.953
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's still standing there right next to </v>

871
00:43:37.851 --> 00:43:41.620
<v Speaker 2>the computer and they turn it on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not all of a sudden on computer.</v>

872
00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:45.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's other problems with that too,</v>

873
00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:46.613
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

874
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:49.103
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have more neurons in your autonomic </v>

875
00:43:52.471 --> 00:43:55.020
<v Speaker 1>nervous system then you have in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>central nervous system.</v>

876
00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.033
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

877
00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:03.280
<v Speaker 2>brain isn't in your head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just your brain.</v>

878
00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:05.440
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you haven't extended buddy,</v>

879
00:44:05.441 --> 00:44:08.530
<v Speaker 2>so you to the chronic biotics people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they love up the head.</v>

880
00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:09.730
<v Speaker 2>We're just going to clone your butt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

881
00:44:09.731 --> 00:44:12.370
<v Speaker 2>This is getting too complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You really need the whole body.</v>

882
00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:13.423
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's.</v>

883
00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:17.160
<v Speaker 1>That's the physical resurrection issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the idea that,</v>

884
00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:19.700
<v Speaker 1>and I think that you put your finger on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the flaw in,</v>

885
00:44:19.701 --> 00:44:20.700
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

886
00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:21.683
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the new way more tap in the new </v>

887
00:44:23.161 --> 00:44:24.570
<v Speaker 1>immortality crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

888
00:44:24.571 --> 00:44:26.510
<v Speaker 1>they think if they really are </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cartesians,</v>

889
00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.710
<v Speaker 1>they think of your consciousness is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's.</v>

890
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:30.023
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're confused about it in some </v>

891
00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:33.600
<v Speaker 1>because they think of it as a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>soul,</v>

892
00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:34.643
<v Speaker 1>which would be a pattern and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern is only instantiated in the </v>

893
00:44:36.901 --> 00:44:37.740
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

894
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:38.783
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physiologically that's just not the </v>

895
00:44:39.721 --> 00:44:40.720
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

896
00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:42.720
<v Speaker 1>what about the hormones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about.</v>

897
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:44.063
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things going on in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain that aren't easily reducible to </v>

898
00:44:48.091 --> 00:44:48.924
<v Speaker 1>synaptic patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you consider also its </v>

899
00:44:50.851 --> 00:44:53.520
<v Speaker 1>connection with the body and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>consider that.</v>

900
00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:54.893
<v Speaker 1>It's so good.</v>

901
00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:55.853
<v Speaker 2>Even worse than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because not only are we all of those </v>

902
00:44:57.751 --> 00:45:00.930
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are also social beings and so there's</v>

903
00:45:00.931 --> 00:45:01.764
<v Speaker 2>all the interactions we have and have </v>
<v Speaker 2>had with all the other people in our </v>

904
00:45:04.921 --> 00:45:07.230
<v Speaker 2>lives or neighbors or strangers or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

905
00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:08.363
<v Speaker 2>so you have all those binary digits that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be captured of all the </v>

906
00:45:10.801 --> 00:45:13.020
<v Speaker 2>interactions going back in your whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

907
00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:15.750
<v Speaker 2>not just your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all of the social,</v>

908
00:45:15.751 --> 00:45:16.561
<v Speaker 2>cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>political,</v>

909
00:45:16.561 --> 00:45:17.394
<v Speaker 2>economic forces that have been grinding </v>
<v Speaker 2>along for centuries that shape who we </v>

910
00:45:20.281 --> 00:45:22.550
<v Speaker 2>are and the kind of world we live in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

911
00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.270
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to create a virtual </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>

912
00:45:24.271 --> 00:45:26.730
<v Speaker 2>a holodeck that regrade saw that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

913
00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:30.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean this would be a huge computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially.</v>

914
00:45:30.121 --> 00:45:32.190
<v Speaker 2>It would be the universe is what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would need.</v>

915
00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:35.470
<v Speaker 1>What we ended up with a map that's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>as big as the territory.</v>

916
00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:36.540
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

917
00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:38.160
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big problem.</v>

918
00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:41.690
<v Speaker 1>You wrote a book about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's going to fold it up.</v>

919
00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:44.190
<v Speaker 1>Where are you going to put it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the big</v>

920
00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:48.270
<v Speaker 2>like that Steven Wright line about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a map of the United States.</v>

921
00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:49.200
<v Speaker 2>Actual size.</v>

922
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to fold up.</v>

923
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:54.140
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

924
00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:55.100
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

925
00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:58.970
<v Speaker 1>so let me ask you a couple more personal</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions if you don't mind.</v>

926
00:45:58.971 --> 00:46:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Now you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned,</v>

927
00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:02.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>briefly during our,</v>

928
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:04.770
<v Speaker 1>during our conversation that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

929
00:46:04.771 --> 00:46:05.690
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were,</v>

930
00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:06.543
<v Speaker 1>you're from a pretty fundamentalist </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian background and you became a </v>

931
00:46:09.741 --> 00:46:11.660
<v Speaker 1>skeptic and you've been pursuing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

932
00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:14.330
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with well adamantly,</v>

933
00:46:14.331 --> 00:46:18.440
<v Speaker 1>let's say for a very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So two questions is what,</v>

934
00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:19.963
<v Speaker 1>what put you on that path and what do </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think your positive function as a </v>

935
00:46:24.291 --> 00:46:25.550
<v Speaker 1>skeptic is?</v>

936
00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:28.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so first of all,</v>

937
00:46:28.031 --> 00:46:28.864
<v Speaker 2>my family wasn't religious at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't antireligious to just </v>

938
00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:32.643
<v Speaker 2>wasn't a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I became interested in it in the early </v>

939
00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:36.753
<v Speaker 2>seventies when I was in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was sort of the early development </v>

940
00:46:39.521 --> 00:46:41.830
<v Speaker 2>of the Evangelical Movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States.</v>

941
00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:45.370
<v Speaker 2>So I called born again movement and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no affiliation with any church</v>

942
00:46:45.371 --> 00:46:48.520
<v Speaker 2>or particular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all recognize that organized religion</v>

943
00:46:48.521 --> 00:46:52.210
<v Speaker 2>was probably not great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just sort of a one on one.</v>

944
00:46:52.211 --> 00:46:55.000
<v Speaker 2>It's just you and Jesus and the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and God and so on.</v>

945
00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:56.313
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was that whole Jesus Christ </v>

946
00:46:58.841 --> 00:47:00.520
<v Speaker 2>superstar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Timing and all that,</v>

947
00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:05.440
<v Speaker 2>but I took this really seriously and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>went to pepperdine and I took courses in</v>

948
00:47:05.441 --> 00:47:06.274
<v Speaker 2>the Old Testament and New Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read everything cs Lewis wrote to the </v>

949
00:47:08.711 --> 00:47:11.950
<v Speaker 2>course in the writings of Cs Lewis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was into it then.</v>

950
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:14.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at pepperdine you're in the bubble of,</v>

951
00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:15.603
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Christian worldview is totally </v>

952
00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:20.830
<v Speaker 2>consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's internally coherent,</v>

953
00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:22.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>until you're outside the bubble.</v>

954
00:47:22.781 --> 00:47:27.700
<v Speaker 2>So when I went to a secular university </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to study experimental psychology,</v>

955
00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:30.243
<v Speaker 2>not only was that more of a grounding in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the scientific method of understanding </v>

956
00:47:33.311 --> 00:47:34.480
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just for fun.</v>

957
00:47:34.481 --> 00:47:36.010
<v Speaker 2>I took courses in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

958
00:47:36.011 --> 00:47:38.680
<v Speaker 2>I took courses in evolutionary theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of a creationist.</v>

959
00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:40.810
<v Speaker 2>I remember sitting there thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

960
00:47:40.811 --> 00:47:41.950
<v Speaker 2>this stuff is real.</v>

961
00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:45.213
<v Speaker 2>But then I took a course in anthropology</v>
<v Speaker 2>and comparative mythology and that kind </v>

962
00:47:49.871 --> 00:47:50.704
<v Speaker 2>of opened up my eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I sort of went through my Joseph </v>

963
00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:55.150
<v Speaker 2>Campbell stage and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the myth of the hero.</v>

964
00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:57.120
<v Speaker 2>I read the hero of a thousand faces and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

965
00:47:57.121 --> 00:47:57.611
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

966
00:47:57.611 --> 00:47:58.444
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a different way of looking at </v>

967
00:48:00.881 --> 00:48:02.590
<v Speaker 2>things than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than pure scientific way,</v>

968
00:48:02.591 --> 00:48:05.470
<v Speaker 2>but it's also different from a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these religious traditions,</v>

969
00:48:05.471 --> 00:48:06.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>

970
00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:07.473
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of told me that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular religion I was in a wrong to </v>

971
00:48:12.611 --> 00:48:14.260
<v Speaker 2>ask is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it right or wrong?</v>

972
00:48:14.261 --> 00:48:17.330
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a completely different thing and it</v>

973
00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:19.053
<v Speaker 2>just wasn't working for me anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I enjoyed the scientific way of </v>

974
00:48:21.701 --> 00:48:22.534
<v Speaker 2>thinking about the world and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounded by people that it's not that </v>

975
00:48:24.971 --> 00:48:28.570
<v Speaker 2>they were atheists in graduate school </v>
<v Speaker 2>and after that it's like,</v>

976
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:30.640
<v Speaker 2>remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is now the late seventies.</v>

977
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:35.590
<v Speaker 2>And then when I went to graduate school </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the second time for my phd in history</v>

978
00:48:35.591 --> 00:48:37.700
<v Speaker 2>of science of late eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

979
00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:39.370
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole eighth science,</v>

980
00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:40.420
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>atheist,</v>

981
00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.920
<v Speaker 2>atheism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't a thing.</v>

982
00:48:41.921 --> 00:48:42.754
<v Speaker 2>No one really talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like a big thing you have to </v>

983
00:48:44.621 --> 00:48:45.550
<v Speaker 2>decide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>

984
00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:48.510
<v Speaker 2>are you at the eastern atheist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one really talked about that.</v>

985
00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:52.390
<v Speaker 2>And so my focus is really on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>science and understanding things.</v>

986
00:48:52.391 --> 00:48:53.224
<v Speaker 2>Now the problem with being a sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual historian of science </v>

987
00:48:56.861 --> 00:48:57.694
<v Speaker 2>psychologists like I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're interested in study in </v>

988
00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:02.080
<v Speaker 2>beliefs like I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

989
00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:04.780
<v Speaker 2>and then also being a public </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual is the publisher of skeptic</v>

990
00:49:04.781 --> 00:49:05.614
<v Speaker 2>magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I write this column for scientific </v>

991
00:49:06.671 --> 00:49:07.504
<v Speaker 2>American every month I got to </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially debunk something or analyze </v>

992
00:49:10.241 --> 00:49:13.920
<v Speaker 2>something is it kind of puts you in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>role of like,</v>

993
00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:15.790
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to say if this is right or wrong,</v>

994
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:19.060
<v Speaker 2>this is true or false or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something in between.</v>

995
00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:19.970
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

996
00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:20.803
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm constantly on this kind of razor </v>

997
00:49:21.821 --> 00:49:22.654
<v Speaker 2>edge between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just am curious observer of people's </v>

998
00:49:26.951 --> 00:49:28.510
<v Speaker 2>beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then on the other hand,</v>

999
00:49:28.511 --> 00:49:31.900
<v Speaker 2>I have actually have to pass judgment </v>
<v Speaker 2>and writing every month.</v>

1000
00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:34.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this one correct or not correct?</v>

1001
00:49:34.151 --> 00:49:36.070
<v Speaker 2>Or something in between them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1002
00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:37.580
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some might,</v>

1003
00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:40.390
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's at that different levels.</v>

1004
00:49:40.391 --> 00:49:41.224
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I'm just talking about </v>

1005
00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:44.220
<v Speaker 2>people's beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other Times I'm at,</v>

1006
00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:46.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually kind of forced to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1007
00:49:46.061 --> 00:49:48.190
<v Speaker 2>I think this is probably true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're probably not true.</v>

1008
00:49:49.170 --> 00:49:49.800
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1009
00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:50.790
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1010
00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:51.653
<v Speaker 2>I listened to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to listen to that first podcast </v>

1011
00:49:53.711 --> 00:49:58.711
<v Speaker 2>you do with Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so difficult to get through again to me,</v>

1012
00:50:00.071 --> 00:50:00.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two hours,</v>

1013
00:50:00.851 --> 00:50:01.684
<v Speaker 2>you were just talking past each other at</v>
<v Speaker 2>different levels of Sam's laser focused </v>

1014
00:50:05.441 --> 00:50:06.274
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1015
00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:07.393
<v Speaker 2>people behave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they act on certain beliefs and the </v>

1016
00:50:10.991 --> 00:50:11.824
<v Speaker 2>obvious one flying planes into buildings</v>
<v Speaker 2>is because you have a certain belief </v>

1017
00:50:14.171 --> 00:50:15.910
<v Speaker 2>that leads to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1018
00:50:15.911 --> 00:50:16.420
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

1019
00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:17.253
<v Speaker 2>And it would be good if people didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe these things that lead them to </v>

1020
00:50:18.761 --> 00:50:20.750
<v Speaker 2>do those kinds of violent acts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1021
00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:21.723
<v Speaker 2>but there's a whole nother level you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about beliefs that have nothing to </v>

1022
00:50:24.401 --> 00:50:26.950
<v Speaker 2>do with leading to violence or so on and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to.</v>

1023
00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:27.943
<v Speaker 2>It just depends on what's your goal when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about this particular </v>

1024
00:50:31.251 --> 00:50:32.800
<v Speaker 2>thing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1025
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:34.250
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1026
00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:35.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

1027
00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:38.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm good friends with Stephen Jay Gould </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1028
00:50:38.751 --> 00:50:43.751
<v Speaker 2>I was sympathetic to his noma</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the sense that the world's already to</v>

1029
00:50:44.061 --> 00:50:46.550
<v Speaker 2>tribal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if we can calm everybody down,</v>

1030
00:50:46.551 --> 00:50:48.470
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>

1031
00:50:48.471 --> 00:50:49.304
<v Speaker 2>I do think science and reason Kennan </v>
<v Speaker 2>form and maybe even in some cases </v>

1032
00:50:52.191 --> 00:50:55.190
<v Speaker 2>determined human values and moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions,</v>

1033
00:50:55.191 --> 00:50:57.790
<v Speaker 2>right and wrong and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've written quite a bit about that too,</v>

1034
00:50:58.190 --> 00:51:01.520
<v Speaker 2>and so again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of a different level of what</v>

1035
00:51:01.521 --> 00:51:05.120
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about and what the goals </v>
<v Speaker 2>are at that particular moment.</v>

1036
00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:06.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1037
00:51:06.601 --> 00:51:08.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean the skeptic when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

1038
00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:12.480
<v Speaker 1>when I think of a skeptic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a strange leap of course,</v>

1039
00:51:12.481 --> 00:51:17.481
<v Speaker 1>but there's a scene in revelation where </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ comes back and he comes back with</v>

1040
00:51:18.031 --> 00:51:18.864
<v Speaker 1>a sword coming out of his mouth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where he divides the damn didn't </v>

1041
00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:24.420
<v Speaker 1>save and that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also an image of the logos,</v>

1042
00:51:24.421 --> 00:51:25.254
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word that brings forth order out of </v>

1043
00:51:27.271 --> 00:51:30.090
<v Speaker 1>chaos because hardly what you do as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>skeptic.</v>

1044
00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:34.920
<v Speaker 1>It isn't so much that you dam the untrue</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you rescued the truth and that's</v>

1045
00:51:34.921 --> 00:51:38.250
<v Speaker 1>really necessary for people because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to stand on a rock.</v>

1046
00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:42.120
<v Speaker 1>And now one of the big problems I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>with new age movement,</v>

1047
00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:43.113
<v Speaker 1>and I've kind of started this </v>
<v Speaker 1>technically looking at the way that </v>

1048
00:51:44.941 --> 00:51:45.774
<v Speaker 1>creative people think because there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative people who are critically </v>

1049
00:51:48.001 --> 00:51:48.834
<v Speaker 1>minded and there are creative people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not critically minded and non </v>

1050
00:51:52.261 --> 00:51:53.094
<v Speaker 1>critically minded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Creativity seems more associated with </v>

1051
00:51:55.261 --> 00:51:56.094
<v Speaker 1>mental illness and psychopathology or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be able to discriminate </v>

1052
00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:02.040
<v Speaker 1>between what's worth saving and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't so to speak.</v>

1053
00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:03.233
<v Speaker 1>And that's what a good skeptic does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause a skeptic isn't necessarily </v>

1054
00:52:05.521 --> 00:52:06.780
<v Speaker 1>someone who says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1055
00:52:06.781 --> 00:52:10.200
<v Speaker 1>this is all false.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A good skeptic is someone who says,</v>

1056
00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:13.140
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a kernel of truth here,</v>

1057
00:52:13.141 --> 00:52:15.770
<v Speaker 1>but it's deeply buried under layers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>layers of,</v>

1058
00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:16.933
<v Speaker 1>of rust and nonsense that needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>burned away or polished away so that we </v>

1059
00:52:20.341 --> 00:52:22.080
<v Speaker 1>can get to what's absolutely essential.</v>

1060
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:24.343
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So back to where you were saying before </v>

1061
00:52:25.941 --> 00:52:30.200
<v Speaker 2>about striving upwards towards something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that heaven up there,</v>

1062
00:52:30.201 --> 00:52:31.700
<v Speaker 2>whatever that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1063
00:52:31.810 --> 00:52:33.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course we don't want to go for utopia</v>

1064
00:52:33.831 --> 00:52:38.720
<v Speaker 2>because there's no such place to get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that causes catastrophes in history.</v>

1065
00:52:38.721 --> 00:52:39.554
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the idea of making the world a more </v>

1066
00:52:42.891 --> 00:52:45.860
<v Speaker 2>rational place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a good goal and this is the kind</v>

1067
00:52:45.861 --> 00:52:48.310
<v Speaker 2>of thing that we do at skeptic magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1068
00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:49.333
<v Speaker 2>what do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We promote science and reason and </v>

1069
00:52:50.751 --> 00:52:51.584
<v Speaker 2>critical thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You write about critical thinking and </v>

1070
00:52:53.211 --> 00:52:54.930
<v Speaker 2>this is what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1071
00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:57.320
<v Speaker 2>so we're all working on that and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's good.</v>

1072
00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:58.543
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1073
00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:01.803
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

1074
00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:03.360
<v Speaker 2>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1075
00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:05.370
<v Speaker 2>when we talk about literature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1076
00:53:05.371 --> 00:53:07.550
<v Speaker 2>this return to the books of the Bible or</v>
<v Speaker 2>dusty,</v>

1077
00:53:07.551 --> 00:53:08.384
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or if we want to make our listeners' </v>

1078
00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:13.340
<v Speaker 2>heads explode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ian Rand and Atlas Shrug.</v>

1079
00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:19.190
<v Speaker 2>Why have people by the tens of millions </v>
<v Speaker 2>purchased her books?</v>

1080
00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:21.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literary critics say they're awful,</v>

1081
00:53:21.231 --> 00:53:22.064
<v Speaker 2>they're terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Novels are not well written and her </v>

1082
00:53:23.601 --> 00:53:26.070
<v Speaker 2>fingers are black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And her philosophy is wrong.</v>

1083
00:53:26.071 --> 00:53:27.870
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But ask yourself,</v>

1084
00:53:27.871 --> 00:53:30.330
<v Speaker 2>why do tens of millions of people love </v>
<v Speaker 2>those books?</v>

1085
00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:33.600
<v Speaker 2>And it's because she's doing something </v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

1086
00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:36.480
<v Speaker 2>She's not trying to spread the world the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way it actually is,</v>

1087
00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:37.343
<v Speaker 2>but that the way it could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these are the things we've done </v>

1088
00:53:39.691 --> 00:53:40.680
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Communism,</v>

1089
00:53:40.681 --> 00:53:41.514
<v Speaker 2>socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because she came out of that Russian </v>

1090
00:53:43.021 --> 00:53:46.530
<v Speaker 2>background and so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her figures like John Golf,</v>

1091
00:53:46.531 --> 00:53:49.150
<v Speaker 2>these are kind of ideal things to strive</v>
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>

1092
00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1093
00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:51.253
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that her fingers are archetypal </v>

1094
00:53:52.501 --> 00:53:54.240
<v Speaker 1>heroes have a certain form.</v>

1095
00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:58.650
<v Speaker 2>If we could bring it back to some real </v>
<v Speaker 2>world example.</v>

1096
00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:01.930
<v Speaker 2>I just recently recently started </v>
<v Speaker 2>following a Jocko willink.</v>

1097
00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:06.280
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm never going to be Jocko willink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1098
00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:09.790
<v Speaker 2>I got his book and I read one page a day</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1099
00:54:09.810 --> 00:54:10.990
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of like,</v>

1100
00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:11.471
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1101
00:54:11.471 --> 00:54:14.110
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get up at six in the morning and</v>

1102
00:54:14.111 --> 00:54:15.940
<v Speaker 2>get out there on your bike riding with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the guys.</v>

1103
00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:16.893
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I see tacos page and he's good </v>

1104
00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:21.480
<v Speaker 2>at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1105
00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:25.340
<v Speaker 2>So in a way it's not describing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world in a scientific way of it's,</v>

1106
00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:30.100
<v Speaker 2>it's sending a different message,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you should strive to be this,</v>

1107
00:54:30.130 --> 00:54:32.170
<v Speaker 2>even if you don't make it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just do it,</v>

1108
00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:33.620
<v Speaker 2>do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything.</v>

1109
00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:36.790
<v Speaker 2>And that's a different sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different goal.</v>

1110
00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:38.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think to that.</v>

1111
00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:40.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>

1112
00:54:40.671 --> 00:54:41.504
<v Speaker 1>with regards to again round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the criticism leveled at her </v>

1113
00:54:43.611 --> 00:54:44.444
<v Speaker 1>that her characters are too black and </v>
<v Speaker 1>white is correct because I think that </v>

1114
00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:51.620
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that distinguishes </v>
<v Speaker 1>great literature from propaganda is that</v>

1115
00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:55.700
<v Speaker 1>in great literature most of the conflict</v>
<v Speaker 1>is within rather than between.</v>

1116
00:54:56.810 --> 00:54:57.471
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1117
00:54:57.471 --> 00:54:58.304
<v Speaker 1>and the problem with Ayn rand is all her</v>
<v Speaker 1>good characters are the same good </v>

1118
00:55:01.131 --> 00:55:04.940
<v Speaker 1>character and all her bad characters are</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same bad character and,</v>

1119
00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:07.650
<v Speaker 1>and there's no overlap between them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a curiosity,</v>

1120
00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:08.603
<v Speaker 1>there's an architectural purity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that compromises its utility as </v>

1121
00:55:12.171 --> 00:55:13.280
<v Speaker 1>literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say</v>

1122
00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:16.770
<v Speaker 2>alternation makes his point in Gulag </v>
<v Speaker 2>archipelago where he says,</v>

1123
00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:18.360
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if only the world,</v>

1124
00:55:18.361 --> 00:55:21.100
<v Speaker 2>we're simply black and white and we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>take the bad people and,</v>

1125
00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:23.730
<v Speaker 2>and isolate them somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is,</v>

1126
00:55:23.731 --> 00:55:26.270
<v Speaker 2>is you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all have darkness and evil</v>

1127
00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:27.953
<v Speaker 1>last line between good and evil runs </v>
<v Speaker 1>down every heart that says famous </v>

1128
00:55:31.341 --> 00:55:33.340
<v Speaker 1>sprays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was something he experienced very</v>

1129
00:55:33.341 --> 00:55:36.440
<v Speaker 1>deeply and is also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also pride,</v>

1130
00:55:36.670 --> 00:55:38.230
<v Speaker 1>primordial true</v>

1131
00:55:40.890 --> 00:55:42.370
<v Speaker 2>analyze literature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this as well.</v>

1132
00:55:42.371 --> 00:55:47.350
<v Speaker 2>There's a body of literature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary literary analysis in which,</v>

1133
00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:48.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1134
00:55:48.430 --> 00:55:51.010
<v Speaker 2>Pete pinker writes about this at the end</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the blank slate,</v>

1135
00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:53.710
<v Speaker 2>which he talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1136
00:55:53.711 --> 00:55:54.544
<v Speaker 2>what these novels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these sophisticated novels in which the </v>

1137
00:55:57.221 --> 00:55:59.050
<v Speaker 2>characters are rich and deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1138
00:55:59.051 --> 00:55:59.884
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have all these good characters and </v>

1139
00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:03.070
<v Speaker 2>bad characters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristics and so on.</v>

1140
00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:04.660
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1141
00:56:04.661 --> 00:56:05.494
<v Speaker 2>and we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can glean from that in a sense that </v>

1142
00:56:07.331 --> 00:56:09.160
<v Speaker 2>the novelists were ahead of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive.</v>

1143
00:56:09.161 --> 00:56:10.700
<v Speaker 2>This is his point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the novelist.</v>

1144
00:56:10.701 --> 00:56:12.190
<v Speaker 2>We're about a century ahead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>excitement,</v>

1145
00:56:12.191 --> 00:56:15.940
<v Speaker 2>give scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>figuring out of human nature</v>

1146
00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:18.160
<v Speaker 1>or maybe a thousand years ahead,</v>

1147
00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:22.150
<v Speaker 2>modern literature anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1148
00:56:22.530 --> 00:56:23.363
<v Speaker 2>so we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can gain a lot from there and not </v>

1149
00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:27.640
<v Speaker 2>just the rich emotional experience of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading a good novel,</v>

1150
00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:28.793
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually teasing out this is what </v>

1151
00:56:29.921 --> 00:56:32.350
<v Speaker 2>some of these evolutionary literary </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are trying to do.</v>

1152
00:56:32.351 --> 00:56:35.710
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's certain themes that </v>
<v Speaker 2>come up over and over and over again.</v>

1153
00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:37.810
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not totally random.</v>

1154
00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:40.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlike the postmodernists,</v>

1155
00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:45.220
<v Speaker 2>there actually are a certain real </v>
<v Speaker 2>meanings that the author intended.</v>

1156
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:47.223
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem with the </v>

1157
00:56:47.731 --> 00:56:50.970
<v Speaker 1>postmodernists technically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought a lot about this,</v>

1158
00:56:50.971 --> 00:56:53.910
<v Speaker 1>is that they got their initial criticism</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1159
00:56:53.911 --> 00:56:54.744
<v Speaker 1>which is that there's an infinite number</v>
<v Speaker 1>of ways of interpreting a finite set of </v>

1160
00:56:57.511 --> 00:56:59.850
<v Speaker 1>phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there isn't an,</v>

1161
00:56:59.970 --> 00:57:00.803
<v Speaker 1>there isn't a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there isn't an infinite number of valid </v>

1162
00:57:02.731 --> 00:57:07.731
<v Speaker 1>ways of interpreting a finite set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena and that's where you get right</v>

1163
00:57:08.131 --> 00:57:08.964
<v Speaker 1>back into the issue of circulation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the interpretation around these great </v>

1164
00:57:13.381 --> 00:57:15.830
<v Speaker 1>underlying architectural themes that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>built in,</v>

1165
00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:16.693
<v Speaker 1>in large part right into our biology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read a really interesting analysis of </v>

1166
00:57:20.401 --> 00:57:21.470
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1167
00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:24.120
<v Speaker 1>of the symbol of the dragon a while </v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

1168
00:57:24.121 --> 00:57:27.090
<v Speaker 1>and I can't conjure up the name of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book unfortunately,</v>

1169
00:57:27.091 --> 00:57:30.510
<v Speaker 1>but his hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was a very good one,</v>

1170
00:57:30.511 --> 00:57:35.511
<v Speaker 1>was that a dragon is a Metta Predator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's the symbol for Predator and,</v>

1171
00:57:38.790 --> 00:57:39.720
<v Speaker 1>but it's more than that.</v>

1172
00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:40.553
<v Speaker 1>But the Predator is tree snake bird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the fundamental predators have </v>

1173
00:57:46.261 --> 00:57:49.920
<v Speaker 1>treatwell in primates were cats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes and birds.</v>

1174
00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:53.340
<v Speaker 1>And so what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an amalgam of all those things.</v>

1175
00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:54.413
<v Speaker 1>And so it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like the category of creditor is </v>

1176
00:57:56.941 --> 00:57:57.774
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though snakes and cats are both in </v>

1177
00:57:59.551 --> 00:58:01.200
<v Speaker 1>the category of Predator and no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

1178
00:58:01.201 --> 00:58:03.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no such thing as a Predator,</v>

1179
00:58:03.570 --> 00:58:06.270
<v Speaker 1>and then you can add fire to that for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>variety of reasons,</v>

1180
00:58:06.271 --> 00:58:09.990
<v Speaker 1>not least being a being I'm sure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire white belt,</v>

1181
00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:13.440
<v Speaker 1>many of our ancestors as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the additional twist,</v>

1182
00:58:13.441 --> 00:58:17.670
<v Speaker 1>which is the dragons also hoard gold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so human beings,</v>

1183
00:58:17.671 --> 00:58:18.504
<v Speaker 1>because we're not just prey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Animals learned that if we confronted </v>

1184
00:58:20.491 --> 00:58:23.160
<v Speaker 1>the Metta Predator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would gain as a consequence.</v>

1185
00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:28.960
<v Speaker 2>So there are certain channels down which</v>
<v Speaker 2>good stories go based on our,</v>

1186
00:58:28.990 --> 00:58:29.823
<v Speaker 2>our biological nature or evolved nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that it's completely </v>

1187
00:58:32.171 --> 00:58:33.810
<v Speaker 2>deterministic in that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1188
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:34.170
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1189
00:58:34.170 --> 00:58:36.890
<v Speaker 1>It's variations on a theme I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1190
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:38.103
<v Speaker 1>so that was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an interesting article </v>

1191
00:58:39.721 --> 00:58:42.120
<v Speaker 1>published,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a nature a few months ago</v>

1192
00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:43.703
<v Speaker 1>showing that it was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very high resolution brain scan and so </v>

1193
00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:47.073
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the idea of course that in the </v>

1194
00:58:47.941 --> 00:58:48.774
<v Speaker 1>cortex that neurons that fire together </v>
<v Speaker 1>wire together and then we learned that </v>

1195
00:58:52.410 --> 00:58:54.830
<v Speaker 1>the neurons are actually in cortical </v>
<v Speaker 1>columns.</v>

1196
00:58:54.831 --> 00:58:57.570
<v Speaker 1>So they actually have their structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their unit structure,</v>

1197
00:58:57.571 --> 00:59:00.870
<v Speaker 1>so they're not just randomly connecting </v>
<v Speaker 1>with neurons everywhere in the brain,</v>

1198
00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:02.093
<v Speaker 1>but what his scan showed was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying super highway of building </v>

1199
00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:06.653
<v Speaker 1>connections so that the columns </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves could wire into the already </v>

1200
00:59:10.141 --> 00:59:10.974
<v Speaker 1>existing super highways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was like there was an underlying </v>

1201
00:59:14.041 --> 00:59:14.874
<v Speaker 1>architecture that was highly probable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was highly probable that it would </v>

1202
00:59:17.611 --> 00:59:18.444
<v Speaker 1>manifest itself and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that looks like the neural </v>

1203
00:59:20.461 --> 00:59:22.370
<v Speaker 1>architecture of something like an </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetype</v>

1204
00:59:25.070 --> 00:59:29.150
<v Speaker 2>arguments</v>
<v Speaker 2>for crown is that it would be really fun</v>

1205
00:59:29.151 --> 00:59:29.984
<v Speaker 2>to come back and say a thousand years </v>
<v Speaker 2>from now just to see what scientists or </v>

1206
00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:35.930
<v Speaker 2>scholars or talking about like of how </v>
<v Speaker 2>the brain works.</v>

1207
00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:36.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1208
00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:39.020
<v Speaker 2>what's the metaphor they're using then </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1209
00:59:39.810 --> 00:59:41.840
<v Speaker 2>And they'll look back on us and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1210
00:59:41.841 --> 00:59:44.060
<v Speaker 2>they thought the brain is a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How</v>

1211
00:59:46.650 --> 00:59:50.510
<v Speaker 2>are the time we come up with a fully </v>
<v Speaker 2>material account of consciousness.</v>

1212
00:59:50.511 --> 00:59:51.344
<v Speaker 2>Our notion of what constitutes material </v>
<v Speaker 2>will have undergone substantial </v>

1213
00:59:53.841 --> 00:59:54.674
<v Speaker 2>revision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I do wonder if sometimes I toy with </v>

1214
00:59:58.551 --> 01:00:00.560
<v Speaker 2>the idea of the mysterians dino and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mysterians.</v>

1215
01:00:00.561 --> 01:00:03.380
<v Speaker 2>There's certain mysteries of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe we will never solve.</v>

1216
01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:04.273
<v Speaker 2>We just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the limitations that this </v>

1217
01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:09.890
<v Speaker 2>structure of our brain and so God free </v>
<v Speaker 2>will and determinism,</v>

1218
01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:11.900
<v Speaker 2>the nature of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1219
01:00:11.930 --> 01:00:15.210
<v Speaker 2>there's a few of these core deep </v>
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>

1220
01:00:15.211 --> 01:00:16.044
<v Speaker 2>So my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the late great Martin Gardner called </v>

1221
01:00:18.771 --> 01:00:22.160
<v Speaker 2>himself a Deist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're probably familiar with the DSM.</v>

1222
01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.900
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1223
01:00:23.901 --> 01:00:25.520
<v Speaker 2>it's based on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1224
01:00:25.790 --> 01:00:27.110
<v Speaker 2>William James and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1225
01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:28.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1226
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:33.150
<v Speaker 2>manual mumo pragmatist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of a pragmatist philosophy.</v>

1227
01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:34.964
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Martin Martin was his longtime column </v>

1228
01:00:36.601 --> 01:00:37.520
<v Speaker 2>district,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scientific American,</v>

1229
01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:38.453
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the founders of the modern </v>

1230
01:00:39.081 --> 01:00:42.020
<v Speaker 2>skeptical movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was as skeptical as I am,</v>

1231
01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:42.913
<v Speaker 2>maybe more on almost everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he believed in God and he believed </v>

1232
01:00:46.311 --> 01:00:47.144
<v Speaker 2>in prayer and the afterlife and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though he would say to fellow </v>

1233
01:00:51.081 --> 01:00:52.610
<v Speaker 2>skeptics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1234
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:54.830
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the atheist have slightly better</v>

1235
01:00:54.831 --> 01:00:56.570
<v Speaker 2>arguments than the theater just </v>
<v Speaker 2>slightly,</v>

1236
01:00:56.930 --> 01:00:57.763
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can't determine one way or </v>

1237
01:00:59.331 --> 01:01:00.164
<v Speaker 2>the other for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether there's a god or not with </v>

1238
01:01:02.330 --> 01:01:05.090
<v Speaker 2>determinism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's okay to just practically speaking,</v>

1239
01:01:05.330 --> 01:01:08.890
<v Speaker 2>to just do whatever works for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the pregnancies and things.</v>

1240
01:01:08.891 --> 01:01:10.550
<v Speaker 2>So he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>

1241
01:01:10.551 --> 01:01:11.384
<v Speaker 2>he prays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He believes that there is some kind of </v>

1242
01:01:12.861 --> 01:01:14.690
<v Speaker 2>afterlife and that there's something out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1243
01:01:14.691 --> 01:01:16.550
<v Speaker 2>not an anthropomorphic God or anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1244
01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:21.210
<v Speaker 2>So he called this fideism anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I kind of respected that because he,</v>

1245
01:01:21.211 --> 01:01:25.280
<v Speaker 2>he didn't make any truth claims like I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can prove this or I'm sure I'm right.</v>

1246
01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:28.530
<v Speaker 2>He said it's just true for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1247
01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:30.530
<v Speaker 2>that gets back to that question of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>is true,</v>

1248
01:01:30.531 --> 01:01:33.440
<v Speaker 2>what is truth anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's all you're saying,</v>

1249
01:01:33.810 --> 01:01:36.500
<v Speaker 2>it's just true for me psychologically </v>
<v Speaker 2>true works for me.</v>

1250
01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:38.210
<v Speaker 2>It's really kind of the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>

1251
01:01:38.850 --> 01:01:40.900
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when I deal with creationists,</v>

1252
01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:43.460
<v Speaker 2>I think the earth is 10,000 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1253
01:01:43.461 --> 01:01:45.470
<v Speaker 2>So we have a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a conflict,</v>

1254
01:01:45.471 --> 01:01:46.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve Gould,</v>

1255
01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:49.220
<v Speaker 2>non overlapping magisterial doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>apply there.</v>

1256
01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:53.180
<v Speaker 2>One side is wrong and one side is right </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're talking about say the age of</v>

1257
01:01:53.181 --> 01:01:56.270
<v Speaker 2>the universe or the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you say,</v>

1258
01:01:56.271 --> 01:01:56.780
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1259
01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:59.330
<v Speaker 2>this is what works for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having this particular,</v>

1260
01:01:59.390 --> 01:02:01.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm not claiming I can prove it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just works for me.</v>

1261
01:02:01.790 --> 01:02:04.070
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was there to say after that,</v>

1262
01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:09.130
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of the end of the conversation</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I do think sometimes that when we're</v>

1263
01:02:10.521 --> 01:02:12.740
<v Speaker 2>talking about free will and determinism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1264
01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:13.603
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean by these words and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>well the devil's always in the details </v>

1265
01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:21.500
<v Speaker 2>in hit an epistemological while we keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>kicking past.</v>

1266
01:02:22.270 --> 01:02:23.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm a compatiblist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1267
01:02:23.970 --> 01:02:24.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan Dennett,</v>

1268
01:02:25.130 --> 01:02:28.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a philosopher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now those kinds of arguments I think</v>

1269
01:02:28.530 --> 01:02:30.570
<v Speaker 2>make more sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In any case,</v>

1270
01:02:30.571 --> 01:02:33.630
<v Speaker 2>I have what I call the behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 2>compatible ism.</v>

1271
01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:34.973
<v Speaker 2>That is whatever your position is </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectually on free will and </v>

1272
01:02:37.051 --> 01:02:37.884
<v Speaker 2>determinism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really matter because when </v>

1273
01:02:38.701 --> 01:02:40.130
<v Speaker 2>you walk out the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1274
01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:40.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1275
01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:42.480
<v Speaker 2>you believed you were making choices.</v>

1276
01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:45.073
<v Speaker 1>This is the argument that I tried to </v>
<v Speaker 1>level at Sam Harris with regards to the </v>

1277
01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:50.640
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical foundations of his ethics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1278
01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:52.003
<v Speaker 1>it's the same sort of thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think Ben Shapiro just went after </v>

1279
01:02:54.381 --> 01:02:55.214
<v Speaker 1>him on the same grounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that I don't care what you say about </v>

1280
01:02:57.201 --> 01:02:58.850
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you're an atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>atheist,</v>

1281
01:02:58.851 --> 01:03:01.610
<v Speaker 1>you act like you're part of the Judeo </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian tradition.</v>

1282
01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:04.730
<v Speaker 1>And so you think you don't believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think you do,</v>

1283
01:03:04.850 --> 01:03:07.970
<v Speaker 1>but we have different definitions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the word believe means.</v>

1284
01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:09.493
<v Speaker 1>So now I'm not saying that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary the argument and all </v>

1285
01:03:11.721 --> 01:03:12.554
<v Speaker 1>arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's one that needs to be taken </v>

1286
01:03:13.551 --> 01:03:14.384
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially by the more rationalistic </v>

1287
01:03:16.161 --> 01:03:18.530
<v Speaker 1>atheists because they don't give the </v>
<v Speaker 1>devil his due.</v>

1288
01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:19.813
<v Speaker 1>Now you're in a different category </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you went through the whole </v>

1289
01:03:21.591 --> 01:03:24.170
<v Speaker 1>Christian thing in detail and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1290
01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:26.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stories and you know,</v>

1291
01:03:26.031 --> 01:03:28.940
<v Speaker 1>the mythology and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychology as well,</v>

1292
01:03:28.941 --> 01:03:29.774
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about Joseph Campbell and </v>

1293
01:03:30.651 --> 01:03:32.150
<v Speaker 1>people like him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1294
01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:33.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that puts you in the,</v>

1295
01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:36.010
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the realm of the,</v>

1296
01:03:36.110 --> 01:03:38.870
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say biblically and,</v>

1297
01:03:39.210 --> 01:03:42.770
<v Speaker 1>and on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a psychoanalytically informed.</v>

1298
01:03:44.050 --> 01:03:44.411
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1299
01:03:44.411 --> 01:03:47.050
<v Speaker 2>it depends what your goals are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you trying to do?</v>

1300
01:03:47.110 --> 01:03:49.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like Sam and Richard know they're</v>

1301
01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:53.620
<v Speaker 2>laser focused on one particular thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're working at so good.</v>

1302
01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:55.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>

1303
01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:56.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm on board with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1304
01:03:56.590 --> 01:03:59.260
<v Speaker 2>I think know certain belief systems are </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous.</v>

1305
01:03:59.290 --> 01:03:59.891
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1306
01:03:59.891 --> 01:04:01.870
<v Speaker 2>So let it be good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we could correct those,</v>

1307
01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:05.770
<v Speaker 2>but I'm also interested in other aspects</v>
<v Speaker 2>of beliefs and um,</v>

1308
01:04:05.771 --> 01:04:06.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1309
01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:08.440
<v Speaker 2>that's a slightly different goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

1310
01:04:08.441 --> 01:04:10.680
<v Speaker 2>when I'm talking to Deepak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1311
01:04:10.810 --> 01:04:13.420
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quantum physics says what it says.</v>

1312
01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:15.240
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at some level I say,</v>

1313
01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:18.760
<v Speaker 2>what's the actionable take home?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

1314
01:04:18.850 --> 01:04:19.683
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's say the world is completely </v>

1315
01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:21.753
<v Speaker 2>determined and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right down to the last synaptic </v>

1316
01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.660
<v Speaker 2>connection that the particles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1317
01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:27.760
<v Speaker 2>And I really have no choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1318
01:04:27.761 --> 01:04:28.594
<v Speaker 2>But so what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still have to choose to go to work </v>

1319
01:04:30.671 --> 01:04:32.830
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow or as I tell Deepak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1320
01:04:32.831 --> 01:04:37.440
<v Speaker 2>my mortgage is still due next Tuesday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even if none of this matters or,</v>

1321
01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:40.930
<v Speaker 2>or it's all empty space or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all consciousness.</v>

1322
01:04:40.990 --> 01:04:41.823
<v Speaker 2>So what</v>
<v Speaker 2>act in the world in a way as if I'm </v>

1323
01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:49.384
<v Speaker 2>making choices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as if I'm responsible for my actions </v>

1324
01:04:51.701 --> 01:04:52.534
<v Speaker 2>because I am.</v>

1325
01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:54.190
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

1326
01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:55.053
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would also say in relationship to </v>

1327
01:04:56.591 --> 01:04:57.424
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there isn't any evidence to me that </v>

1328
01:04:58.780 --> 01:04:59.613
<v Speaker 1>we've been able to determine how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>build a functional society without </v>

1329
01:05:01.841 --> 01:05:05.500
<v Speaker 1>building those axioms into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the substructure of the society,</v>

1330
01:05:06.010 --> 01:05:09.310
<v Speaker 1>freewill and responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they don't exist,</v>

1331
01:05:09.311 --> 01:05:12.520
<v Speaker 1>but if we don't build societies that </v>
<v Speaker 1>assume they exist,</v>

1332
01:05:12.521 --> 01:05:15.370
<v Speaker 1>the society's become unstable </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably rapidly.</v>

1333
01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:18.250
<v Speaker 1>And to me that's a kind of evidence they</v>
<v Speaker 1>do exist.</v>

1334
01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:19.563
<v Speaker 2>I mean even knowing the say game </v>
<v Speaker 2>theoretic model of a tilting the </v>

1335
01:05:24.450 --> 01:05:27.210
<v Speaker 2>incentives to get people to do this </v>
<v Speaker 2>versus that,</v>

1336
01:05:27.211 --> 01:05:29.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a libertarian paternalism,</v>

1337
01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:30.640
<v Speaker 2>Dick Taylor calls it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1338
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:34.880
<v Speaker 2>so if you give people a choice </v>
<v Speaker 2>architecture where you put the desert,</v>

1339
01:05:35.210 --> 01:05:36.043
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the back and in the healthy fruit </v>

1340
01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:38.753
<v Speaker 2>foods in the front or you have different</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of structured menus to get to </v>

1341
01:05:42.031 --> 01:05:42.864
<v Speaker 2>nudge people to choose healthier diets </v>
<v Speaker 2>or better investment tools that </v>

1342
01:05:45.961 --> 01:05:47.010
<v Speaker 2>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

1343
01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:49.680
<v Speaker 2>We're already doing these sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things as if we can,</v>

1344
01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:52.920
<v Speaker 2>if not determined people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's actions and choices,</v>

1345
01:05:52.921 --> 01:05:54.980
<v Speaker 2>but at least shape them in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1346
01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:58.230
<v Speaker 2>but even doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're actively choosing to do that.</v>

1347
01:05:58.650 --> 01:06:03.120
<v Speaker 2>So being self aware that I know that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>I go shopping on an empty stomach,</v>

1348
01:06:03.121 --> 01:06:03.954
<v Speaker 2>I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm much more likely to buy unhealthy </v>

1349
01:06:05.491 --> 01:06:07.590
<v Speaker 2>foods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cookies or ice cream or whatever.</v>

1350
01:06:07.590 --> 01:06:10.080
<v Speaker 2>Then I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I went shopping on a full stomach,</v>

1351
01:06:10.081 --> 01:06:10.914
<v Speaker 2>so I choose to alter my environment </v>
<v Speaker 2>around me because I'm going to nudge </v>

1352
01:06:14.911 --> 01:06:15.744
<v Speaker 2>myself in another direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is that not a kind of a choice and </v>

1353
01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:23.240
<v Speaker 2>if you're a determinist to determine </v>
<v Speaker 2>determinants,</v>

1354
01:06:23.250 --> 01:06:25.020
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um.</v>

1355
01:06:25.021 --> 01:06:28.050
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you recognize say that the addict who</v>

1356
01:06:28.051 --> 01:06:28.884
<v Speaker 2>is just totally hooked on heroin or acce</v>
<v Speaker 2>coat on or something is different from </v>

1357
01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:37.110
<v Speaker 2>Uni who are not addicted and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a difference.</v>

1358
01:06:37.111 --> 01:06:38.380
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that difference?</v>

1359
01:06:38.610 --> 01:06:39.443
<v Speaker 2>If it's all determinism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's tumors all the way down or </v>

1360
01:06:41.470 --> 01:06:43.630
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1361
01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:44.633
<v Speaker 2>what is the difference then between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>addict and the addict is more </v>

1362
01:06:46.711 --> 01:06:48.310
<v Speaker 2>determined?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1363
01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:52.680
<v Speaker 2>but I to good objection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what is that as a concept?</v>

1364
01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:54.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

1365
01:06:54.301 --> 01:06:55.350
<v Speaker 2>More determined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1366
01:06:55.351 --> 01:06:56.460
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1367
01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:59.430
<v Speaker 2>That's why I like Dan dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's idea of the degrees of freedom.</v>

1368
01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:01.283
<v Speaker 2>You and I have more degrees of freedom </v>
<v Speaker 2>that our dogs are dogs more than the </v>

1369
01:07:05.010 --> 01:07:06.110
<v Speaker 2>cockroach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1370
01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:07.223
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just more variation and we have </v>

1371
01:07:09.061 --> 01:07:09.894
<v Speaker 2>one additional</v>

1372
01:07:10.290 --> 01:07:13.850
<v Speaker 1>we're aware of in terms of time as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1373
01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:15.330
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're driving,</v>

1374
01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:16.253
<v Speaker 1>here's a nice way of thinking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between free will and </v>

1375
01:07:18.271 --> 01:07:19.104
<v Speaker 1>determinism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you're driving down the road </v>

1376
01:07:20.641 --> 01:07:23.580
<v Speaker 1>at 60 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you look?</v>

1377
01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:25.493
<v Speaker 1>And the answer isn't right in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the car because you've already run over </v>

1378
01:07:28.501 --> 01:07:29.910
<v Speaker 1>the thing that's right in front of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

1379
01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:33.000
<v Speaker 1>So you look about a quarter of a mile </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the road.</v>

1380
01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:34.463
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to sequence your deterministic </v>

1381
01:07:37.311 --> 01:07:38.144
<v Speaker 1>auctions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this idea of a ballistic </v>

1382
01:07:40.051 --> 01:07:41.820
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I do this,</v>

1383
01:07:41.850 --> 01:07:42.683
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see I didn't hit my hand when I </v>

1384
01:07:45.421 --> 01:07:46.710
<v Speaker 1>came down like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1385
01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:50.430
<v Speaker 1>the truth of the matter is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there isn't enough time.</v>

1386
01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:54.270
<v Speaker 1>So when I released this movement </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly,</v>

1387
01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:59.580
<v Speaker 1>there isn't enough time for the message </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get from my hand to my brain and back</v>

1388
01:07:59.581 --> 01:08:02.310
<v Speaker 1>to stop my hand as an element of free </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice.</v>

1389
01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:05.940
<v Speaker 1>I have to plan and release the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement at once,</v>

1390
01:08:05.941 --> 01:08:08.160
<v Speaker 1>including the stopping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ballistic.</v>

1391
01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:11.850
<v Speaker 1>And so as soon as I implement that </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement,</v>

1392
01:08:11.851 --> 01:08:12.684
<v Speaker 1>there is no free will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the space that have choice </v>

1393
01:08:15.921 --> 01:08:18.650
<v Speaker 1>over has collapsed into a deterministic </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

1394
01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:19.873
<v Speaker 1>but I think what we do is we look out in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the future far enough so that we can </v>

1395
01:08:22.641 --> 01:08:23.474
<v Speaker 1>sequence our choices and they collapse </v>
<v Speaker 1>into determinism as we implement </v>

1396
01:08:27.310 --> 01:08:28.143
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that works neurologically </v>

1397
01:08:30.201 --> 01:08:31.100
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at how,</v>

1398
01:08:31.450 --> 01:08:32.283
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how action patterns actually manifest </v>

1399
01:08:33.801 --> 01:08:34.634
<v Speaker 1>themselves in the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does seem to be something akin to </v>

1400
01:08:36.201 --> 01:08:37.034
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't make much out of the liberty </v>

1401
01:08:39.170 --> 01:08:40.810
<v Speaker 1>limited experiments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1402
01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:44.320
<v Speaker 2>well limited himself was a compatiblist </v>
<v Speaker 2>he did not believe in,</v>

1403
01:08:44.330 --> 01:08:45.163
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in complete determinism that wears a </v>

1404
01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:48.813
<v Speaker 2>pink or put it this way in the blanks </v>
<v Speaker 2>slate that you are part of the causal </v>

1405
01:08:51.981 --> 01:08:52.814
<v Speaker 2>net of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're part of it and you're making </v>

1406
01:08:55.411 --> 01:08:58.320
<v Speaker 2>choices that further determined the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe,</v>

1407
01:08:58.590 --> 01:09:02.430
<v Speaker 2>but they're still your choice so you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>morally accountable for them.</v>

1408
01:09:02.910 --> 01:09:06.330
<v Speaker 2>I do think the law has evolved nicely </v>
<v Speaker 2>along these lines along the,</v>

1409
01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:07.393
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of shades of grey or the to know </v>

1410
01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:11.333
<v Speaker 2>the law if you intended to kill somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>versus doing it in an act of a rage </v>

1411
01:09:16.231 --> 01:09:18.570
<v Speaker 2>because it was just on spur of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>

1412
01:09:18.571 --> 01:09:21.420
<v Speaker 2>You've got your spouse and you and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>lose your temper.</v>

1413
01:09:21.421 --> 01:09:23.550
<v Speaker 2>That's different from the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we,</v>

1414
01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:24.463
<v Speaker 2>we find out that for weeks you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>plotting this to kill your spouse or </v>

1415
01:09:27.871 --> 01:09:28.704
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get a different kind of </v>

1416
01:09:29.881 --> 01:09:31.590
<v Speaker 2>penalty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that matches,</v>

1417
01:09:31.630 --> 01:09:33.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroscience pretty well.</v>

1418
01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:33.841
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

1419
01:09:33.841 --> 01:09:36.870
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More or less control over.</v>

1420
01:09:36.871 --> 01:09:37.704
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more deterministic versus less </v>

1421
01:09:39.181 --> 01:09:40.860
<v Speaker 2>deterministic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you talking about?</v>

1422
01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:44.850
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about degrees of freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Determinist don't like the word freedom.</v>

1423
01:09:44.851 --> 01:09:46.140
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Call it something else.</v>

1424
01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:51.300
<v Speaker 2>You have more degrees of something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of options.</v>

1425
01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:52.853
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you end up with as a synonym </v>

1426
01:09:53.950 --> 01:09:55.600
<v Speaker 1>eventually ends up meaning freedom.</v>

1427
01:09:56.690 --> 01:09:57.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

1428
01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The word I the word.</v>

1429
01:09:59.931 --> 01:10:00.890
<v Speaker 2>I used the word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1430
01:10:01.290 --> 01:10:04.080
<v Speaker 1>so that's next return.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to show your book again here,</v>

1431
01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:09.260
<v Speaker 1>just so that everybody remembers it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to say what were you.</v>

1432
01:10:09.630 --> 01:10:10.463
<v Speaker 1>Let's end with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What were you hoping or are you hoping </v>

1433
01:10:12.181 --> 01:10:13.014
<v Speaker 1>to accomplish with this book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apart from clarifying your own thoughts </v>

1434
01:10:15.391 --> 01:10:16.410
<v Speaker 1>and communicating them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

1435
01:10:16.770 --> 01:10:17.610
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1436
01:10:17.670 --> 01:10:18.420
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1437
01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:19.253
<v Speaker 1>you've put this message into a bottle </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've launched it out there in the </v>

1438
01:10:21.451 --> 01:10:22.410
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>

1439
01:10:22.411 --> 01:10:23.430
<v Speaker 1>what are you hoping for?</v>

1440
01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:26.000
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really to everybody,</v>

1441
01:10:26.001 --> 01:10:28.730
<v Speaker 2>both religious and nonreligious or </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists.</v>

1442
01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:33.380
<v Speaker 2>The messages at really the here and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>is what counts more than anything else.</v>

1443
01:10:33.381 --> 01:10:34.530
<v Speaker 2>We don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1444
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:38.100
<v Speaker 2>we live in Brooklyn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in 15 billion years from now that,</v>

1445
01:10:38.101 --> 01:10:39.260
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1446
01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:42.770
<v Speaker 2>whether or not there's an afterlife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because clearly no one knows for sure.</v>

1447
01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:47.120
<v Speaker 2>We don't live in the afterlife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We live in this life and,</v>

1448
01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:48.073
<v Speaker 2>and so what you do really matters how </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are in relation with other people </v>

1449
01:10:52.071 --> 01:10:52.904
<v Speaker 2>and your environment really matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It matters not just for the future but </v>

1450
01:10:55.870 --> 01:10:57.800
<v Speaker 2>the immediate future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even now,</v>

1451
01:10:58.010 --> 01:11:00.110
<v Speaker 2>whatever that means to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1452
01:11:00.111 --> 01:11:00.761
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1453
01:11:00.761 --> 01:11:01.594
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad people are working on this and </v>

1454
01:11:03.141 --> 01:11:04.630
<v Speaker 2>thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1455
01:11:04.770 --> 01:11:05.603
<v Speaker 2>and if we can improve society </v>
<v Speaker 2>incrementally a little bit instead of </v>

1456
01:11:09.741 --> 01:11:12.400
<v Speaker 2>aiming for utopia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aim for protopia.</v>

1457
01:11:12.530 --> 01:11:13.363
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1458
01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:14.130
<v Speaker 1>that's a great</v>

1459
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:15.420
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Incremental.</v>

1460
01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:20.260
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of aiming for the mortality or a</v>

1461
01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:21.093
<v Speaker 2>thousand years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just aim for getting more people </v>

1462
01:11:21.911 --> 01:11:26.890
<v Speaker 2>to 90 and 100 healthy and happy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>living fulfilled lives.</v>

1463
01:11:26.891 --> 01:11:31.120
<v Speaker 2>And I do talk about in the end about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last chapter,</v>

1464
01:11:31.121 --> 01:11:35.980
<v Speaker 2>less pages in fact about the importance </v>
<v Speaker 2>of aiming to live a purposeful,</v>

1465
01:11:35.981 --> 01:11:37.930
<v Speaker 2>meaningful life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a happiness.</v>

1466
01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:39.073
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've</v>

1467
01:11:40.510 --> 01:11:43.870
<v Speaker 2>just to see the literature develop in </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive psychology about happiness.</v>

1468
01:11:43.871 --> 01:11:45.400
<v Speaker 2>I've read all the books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all great,</v>

1469
01:11:45.970 --> 01:11:49.660
<v Speaker 2>but happiness in the sense of I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to plug into the morphine drip now.</v>

1470
01:11:49.661 --> 01:11:50.494
<v Speaker 2>That's not what life is about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That isn't what gets people meaningful </v>

1471
01:11:52.721 --> 01:11:53.554
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's doing things that don't make you </v>

1472
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:55.990
<v Speaker 2>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1473
01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.390
<v Speaker 2>like again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to your workout every day.</v>

1474
01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:00.220
<v Speaker 2>It's not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not happy working out.</v>

1475
01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:01.840
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1476
01:12:01.841 --> 01:12:04.510
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a caretaker for my parents.</v>

1477
01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:06.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had four parents,</v>

1478
01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:08.890
<v Speaker 2>step parents and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so two of them I was a caretaker.</v>

1479
01:12:08.891 --> 01:12:11.890
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't fun at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get joy,</v>

1480
01:12:11.891 --> 01:12:14.980
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't enjoying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>

1481
01:12:14.981 --> 01:12:16.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an uncomfortable experience,</v>

1482
01:12:16.241 --> 01:12:19.240
<v Speaker 2>but it made me feel better about myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the world.</v>

1483
01:12:19.241 --> 01:12:22.000
<v Speaker 2>Like this is what this is doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something more deeply meaningful.</v>

1484
01:12:22.570 --> 01:12:23.403
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I think that that's where it </v>

1485
01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:28.360
<v Speaker 2>counts actually working to make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world a better place,</v>

1486
01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:30.970
<v Speaker 2>gives you a deeper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more fulfilled life.</v>

1487
01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:33.890
<v Speaker 1>That is an excellent place to end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think like,</v>

1488
01:12:33.891 --> 01:12:37.570
<v Speaker 1>I think amen to that red light for no </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterlife.</v>

1489
01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:39.720
<v Speaker 1>We should improve what we have right in </v>
