00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.940
<v Speaker 1>Short while ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the honor of talking with Ian </v>

2
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Hirsi Ali,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I regard as a genuine modern day </v>

3
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.451
<v Speaker 1>heroin and a role model for all </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals who desire to speak and </v>

4
00:00:28.451 --> 00:00:32.831
<v Speaker 1>embodied the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a little bit about her </v>

5
00:00:32.831 --> 00:00:36.430
<v Speaker 1>before the discussion starts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ali Born in 1969 as a Somali Dutch </v>

6
00:00:37.491 --> 00:00:42.491
<v Speaker 1>American author and scholar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's received international attention </v>

7
00:00:42.491 --> 00:00:47.171
<v Speaker 1>as a critic of Islam and an advocate for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rights and self determination of </v>

8
00:00:47.171 --> 00:00:51.401
<v Speaker 1>Muslim woman opposing honor violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arranged marriage from which she escaped</v>

9
00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:55.400
<v Speaker 1>by immigrating from Somalia and female </v>
<v Speaker 1>genital mutilation,</v>

10
00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.610
<v Speaker 1>to which she was subject as a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a fellow at Stanford's Hoover </v>

11
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Institution and Harvard's Kennedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>School,</v>

12
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.800
<v Speaker 1>a visiting scholar at the American </v>
<v Speaker 1>Enterprise Institute in Washington DC,</v>

13
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.830
<v Speaker 1>and a member of the council on Foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>Relations.</v>

14
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.070
<v Speaker 1>She founded the Ion Hirsi Ali Foundation</v>
<v Speaker 1>explicitly for the defense of women's </v>

15
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.361
<v Speaker 1>rights in 2003 Hirsi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ali was elected to the lower house of </v>

16
00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:24.761
<v Speaker 1>the Dutch House of Representatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a political crisis related to her Dutch </v>

17
00:01:24.761 --> 00:01:28.721
<v Speaker 1>citizenship led to her resignation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>indirectly to the fall of the second </v>

18
00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Balkan end.</v>

19
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.790
<v Speaker 1>Cabinet did not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 2006,</v>

20
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.670
<v Speaker 1>a former devout Muslim Hirsi Ali left </v>
<v Speaker 1>the faith and became a vocal critic of </v>

21
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.830
<v Speaker 1>Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly in radical forums.</v>

22
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.980
<v Speaker 1>She collaborated on a short movie with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Theo van Gogh in 2004 entitled </v>

23
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.720
<v Speaker 1>submission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film depicted the oppression of </v>

24
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.201
<v Speaker 1>women under fundamentalist Islamic law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sparking controversy and threats of </v>

25
00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:56.540
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Van Gogh was in fact stabbed to death by</v>

26
00:01:56.541 --> 00:02:01.541
<v Speaker 1>Mohammed booberry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Moroccan Dutch Islamic terrorists </v>

27
00:02:01.541 --> 00:02:04.400
<v Speaker 1>later that year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hirsi Ali maintains that quote,</v>

28
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.360
<v Speaker 1>Islam is part religion and part a </v>
<v Speaker 1>political military doctrine.</v>

29
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.810
<v Speaker 1>The part that is a political doctrine </v>
<v Speaker 1>contains a worldview,</v>

30
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.870
<v Speaker 1>a system of laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a moral code that is totally </v>

31
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.750
<v Speaker 1>incompatible with our constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our laws,</v>

32
00:02:17.751 --> 00:02:22.751
<v Speaker 1>and our way of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her best and influential books include </v>

33
00:02:22.751 --> 00:02:25.640
<v Speaker 1>the caged virgin 2004,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infidel,</v>

34
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.790
<v Speaker 1>2006 no mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2010 and most recently heretic 2015 </v>

35
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.520
<v Speaker 1>where she calls for a reef formation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam and the defeat of the Islamists in</v>

36
00:02:37.521 --> 00:02:42.521
<v Speaker 1>2005 Hirsi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ali was named as one of Time Magazine's </v>

37
00:02:42.521 --> 00:02:43.220
<v Speaker 1>100 most influential people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

38
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.030
<v Speaker 1>She's also received a free speech award </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Danish newspaper,</v>

39
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Yellen's posting the Swedish Liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>Party's democracy prize and the moral </v>

40
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.831
<v Speaker 1>courage award.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her critics accused Ellie of building </v>

41
00:02:56.831 --> 00:03:00.071
<v Speaker 1>her career on the denigration of Islam </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Muslims questioning her right to </v>

42
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:02.200
<v Speaker 1>authoritatively about Islam and the Arab</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

43
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.350
<v Speaker 1>and portraying her as the embodiment of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the western colonial civilizing mission </v>

44
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.020
<v Speaker 1>discourse.</v>

45
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.130
<v Speaker 1>I guess you'll be able to render </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgment on that yourself.</v>

46
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 1>After watching our discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing I'd like to say is,</v>

47
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.950
<v Speaker 1>thank you very much for agreeing to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>this video.</v>

48
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm very happy to be talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be nervous about it all day </v>

49
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.310
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

50
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.860
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything?</v>

51
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.200
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she tells me to do.</v>

52
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:32.970
<v Speaker 1>I see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

53
00:03:32.971 --> 00:03:33.930
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

54
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.610
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

55
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:41.210
<v Speaker 1>I sent you some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some questions the other day and I </v>

56
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.110
<v Speaker 1>thought that I would first of all ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

57
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.980
<v Speaker 1>I read your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your recent paper,</v>

58
00:03:46.981 --> 00:03:50.790
<v Speaker 1>the one that you wrote for the Hoover </v>
<v Speaker 1>Institute called the challenge of Dawa.</v>

59
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.140
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought maybe I'd ask you if </v>

60
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.140
<v Speaker 1>you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to begin with just to tell people if you</v>

61
00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.011
<v Speaker 1>could give them a brief summary of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were attempting to accomplish with </v>

62
00:04:01.011 --> 00:04:01.011
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might be a good way to start.</v>

63
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 2>So what I was trying to accomplish was </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get the attention.</v>

64
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.730
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also say,</v>

65
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.810
<v Speaker 2>especially if the government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

66
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.460
<v Speaker 2>to the ideology that underlie this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the alphabet tentative thing,</v>

67
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.310
<v Speaker 2>the misogyny against women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>homophobia by Islam is to eliminate all </v>

68
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:24.340
<v Speaker 2>homosexuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

69
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.060
<v Speaker 2>increase in antisemitism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the persecuted Christians</v>

70
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.590
<v Speaker 3>guys like me who are ex Muslims and draw</v>
<v Speaker 3>attention to the venues where these </v>

71
00:04:36.721 --> 00:04:41.721
<v Speaker 3>ideas are disseminated to these schools.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in the mosque them address that.</v>

72
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.060
<v Speaker 3>It's in the neighborhood and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>photo to use.</v>

73
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.990
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's these professionals who </v>
<v Speaker 3>say that they asked you a large gates </v>

74
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.740
<v Speaker 3>for telling young people as young as age</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to hate and hate.</v>

75
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.630
<v Speaker 3>And once we understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once we understand these commitments to </v>

76
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.030
<v Speaker 3>get into the heads and across people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ideas with radical Islam that I fit </v>

77
00:05:13.411 --> 00:05:18.411
<v Speaker 3>it in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll be able to do with the tenor of </v>

78
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.630
<v Speaker 3>the outcomes of the call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Radical Islam is an extension of doubt.</v>

79
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.920
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'd like to see it as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>extension of and for me to have </v>

80
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.641
<v Speaker 3>constitutes the violence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the terrorist attacks and the political </v>

81
00:05:37.641 --> 00:05:39.690
<v Speaker 3>violence it's used to make that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>intended to change.</v>

82
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.680
<v Speaker 3>Society will be able to</v>

83
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.660
<v Speaker 2>eliminate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to eliminate eliminated.</v>

84
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what exactly would you say is the </v>

85
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.871
<v Speaker 1>relationship between Darwin and Jihad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're formulating it by the sounds of </v>

86
00:05:55.871 --> 00:06:00.761
<v Speaker 1>it that Darwin is the to Jihad and these</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the concepts reasonably separable </v>

87
00:06:00.761 --> 00:06:05.651
<v Speaker 1>and I guess a subsidiary question with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be we're talking about </v>

88
00:06:05.651 --> 00:06:06.980
<v Speaker 1>radical Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course many of the people who are</v>

89
00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:11.981
<v Speaker 1>watching are going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be difficult for them to </v>

90
00:06:11.981 --> 00:06:14.570
<v Speaker 1>distinguish between moderate Islam and </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical Islam and I'm also curious about</v>

91
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:19.571
<v Speaker 1>your feelings about exactly that </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction and how such a thing might </v>

92
00:06:19.571 --> 00:06:19.571
<v Speaker 1>be pursued.</v>

93
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.870
<v Speaker 2>So my approach to it is there is one </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam,</v>

94
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.300
<v Speaker 2>but there are three sets of most </v>
<v Speaker 2>letters.</v>

95
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.600
<v Speaker 2>There's one Islam and that one is land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's of different components.</v>

96
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.460
<v Speaker 2>It has religious components,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has a political component,</v>

97
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.010
<v Speaker 2>a social component,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's all encompassing.</v>

98
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.460
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the different sets of </v>

99
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.460
<v Speaker 2>Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you see is one set of Muslims,</v>

100
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:50.321
<v Speaker 2>we just here to the religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>prescriptions and they see being a </v>

101
00:06:50.321 --> 00:06:51.260
<v Speaker 2>Muslim as something private</v>

102
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.560
<v Speaker 3>and when they're confronted by others </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the political activist,</v>

103
00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.640
<v Speaker 3>other bad things that other Muslims who </v>
<v Speaker 3>they involved with the Koran and the </v>

104
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.810
<v Speaker 3>Prophet Muhammad who is the founder of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam by mentioning of his life in the </v>

105
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:13.980
<v Speaker 3>early days when he first started with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this religion and sway people and using,</v>

106
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.650
<v Speaker 3>but then there's the other set of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Muslims I called them.</v>

107
00:07:22.651 --> 00:07:26.480
<v Speaker 3>Then the Dean's list,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other ones who they're the ones that</v>

108
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:31.490
<v Speaker 3>engage in Dallas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're the ones who have the objective </v>

109
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.340
<v Speaker 3>of viewing the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who is the other ones to hate </v>

110
00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.350
<v Speaker 3>homosexuals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To date,</v>

111
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:41.360
<v Speaker 3>women who hate Muslims tend to say that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's their duty to die.</v>

112
00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.550
<v Speaker 3>Converse with people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

113
00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:50.180
<v Speaker 3>I call it the Medina Muslims because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they invoke the prophet Muhammad's life </v>

114
00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.100
<v Speaker 3>and example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the legacy in Medina.</v>

115
00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:01.320
<v Speaker 3>I called the modifiers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are limbs could sending up to the </v>

116
00:08:01.571 --> 00:08:04.930
<v Speaker 3>Medina,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Muslims within Islam.</v>

117
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.120
<v Speaker 3>As a civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a culture,</v>

118
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:13.550
<v Speaker 3>as a political philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a theological problem and we </v>

119
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:14.360
<v Speaker 3>have to deal in theological problem.</v>

120
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:20.490
<v Speaker 2>So these are for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are the three different sets of </v>

121
00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:20.490
<v Speaker 2>Muslims,</v>

122
00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:23.940
<v Speaker 3>the problem of the Medina Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other ones were engaged in your work</v>

123
00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:28.980
<v Speaker 3>to differentiate between what's in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dino Muslims to Israel and the </v>

124
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:34.300
<v Speaker 3>attendant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And why don't we first start with </v>

125
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.140
<v Speaker 3>Dallas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've called you to this love and if you</v>

126
00:08:35.141 --> 00:08:40.141
<v Speaker 3>reject it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you are an enemy of his love and </v>

127
00:08:40.141 --> 00:08:43.820
<v Speaker 3>use violence in their circular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're good arguments.</v>

128
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.340
<v Speaker 3>Why should we or Islamic law was good </v>
<v Speaker 3>for you,</v>

129
00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:55.740
<v Speaker 3>for women and Muslims?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

130
00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.570
<v Speaker 2>this is what is in the club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what Muhammad said,</v>

131
00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:07.770
<v Speaker 2>informing anything confused and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fall to persuade,</v>

132
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.400
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to buy it.</v>

133
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:17.030
<v Speaker 2>Then they apply for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was the reputation of course </v>

134
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:20.080
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have been for the Muslims,</v>

135
00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:24.750
<v Speaker 2>but there's to convinced non Muslims </v>
<v Speaker 2>from that,</v>

136
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:29.910
<v Speaker 2>for that status.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this other project,</v>

137
00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.900
<v Speaker 2>status of purgatory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

138
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:36.910
<v Speaker 2>where you have to pay discriminatory </v>
<v Speaker 2>taxes and lead a life of second class </v>

139
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:43.350
<v Speaker 2>citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the Christians who live </v>

140
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.350
<v Speaker 2>in Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christmas,</v>

141
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.641
<v Speaker 2>who live in Pakistan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>patients who live in the majority of </v>

142
00:09:46.641 --> 00:09:46.641
<v Speaker 2>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that kind of status.</v>

143
00:09:46.641 --> 00:09:49.520
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the Mecca Medina distinction seems to</v>

144
00:09:49.521 --> 00:09:54.521
<v Speaker 1>be very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say both complicated and </v>

145
00:09:54.521 --> 00:09:54.980
<v Speaker 1>problematic because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

146
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.320
<v Speaker 1>so tell me if I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

147
00:09:57.321 --> 00:10:02.321
<v Speaker 1>Because my understanding is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mohammed spent most of the part of his </v>

148
00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:07.811
<v Speaker 1>life that was associated with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishment of Islam in Medina and </v>

149
00:10:07.811 --> 00:10:10.610
<v Speaker 1>noting that guy and that it wasn't until</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went to Medina,</v>

150
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:14.260
<v Speaker 1>that Islam actually became a force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So back in Mecca,</v>

151
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:17.030
<v Speaker 1>although his doctrine appears to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been,</v>

152
00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:18.200
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more peaceful.</v>

153
00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.140
<v Speaker 1>It was also much less successful as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

154
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.120
<v Speaker 1>both a religious and a political </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>

155
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:27.710
<v Speaker 1>So then he left Mecca and I believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>under pressure from the inhabitants,</v>

156
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.140
<v Speaker 1>at least to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moved to Medina.</v>

157
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.070
<v Speaker 1>And then that's when Islam became more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

158
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.320
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more revolutionary and expansive.</v>

159
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:42.130
<v Speaker 1>And so what do you see now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that it isn't universally </v>

160
00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:44.040
<v Speaker 1>accepted among the Islamic community </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

161
00:10:44.041 --> 00:10:47.420
<v Speaker 1>that Mecca Medina distinction is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable one to make.</v>

162
00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:52.450
<v Speaker 1>Because of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the presumption is that there's an </v>

163
00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:52.450
<v Speaker 1>essential unity of thought across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctrines,</v>

164
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.190
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but given,</v>

165
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:59.060
<v Speaker 1>given your interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've read the similar interpretation</v>

166
00:10:59.061 --> 00:11:00.650
<v Speaker 1>among other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>among other people,</v>

167
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:06.400
<v Speaker 1>do you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you see as hopeful within the </v>

168
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.611
<v Speaker 1>Islamic community with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bridging the gap between the say the </v>

169
00:11:09.611 --> 00:11:11.990
<v Speaker 1>earlier works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak of Mohammed and the later,</v>

170
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:12.920
<v Speaker 1>the later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

171
00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:16.730
<v Speaker 1>more revolutionary element of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his actions and his faith.</v>

172
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:18.800
<v Speaker 1>Is there a way that that can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>reconciled?</v>

173
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:25.100
<v Speaker 2>Do Muslims into Mecca,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mecca,</v>

174
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:26.830
<v Speaker 2>Medina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and modifiers.</v>

175
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.240
<v Speaker 2>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course an official,</v>

176
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:34.300
<v Speaker 2>a distinction not accepted anywhere you </v>
<v Speaker 2>really wanted to get to,</v>

177
00:11:34.301 --> 00:11:35.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

178
00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.380
<v Speaker 2>which individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which Muslims,</v>

179
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at war with us.</v>

180
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.360
<v Speaker 2>And should we be worried about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the vasculature?</v>

181
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.560
<v Speaker 2>What about these other Muslims who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking up labels?</v>

182
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:52.480
<v Speaker 2>We will give him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you said the word Islam most work.</v>

183
00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:59.450
<v Speaker 3>One thing that I noticed is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>selected and we justified it.</v>

184
00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:05.560
<v Speaker 3>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they invoke method.</v>

185
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.910
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mohammed's legacy in Mecca.</v>

186
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.790
<v Speaker 3>Because as unfortunately if my sister </v>
<v Speaker 3>tells me,</v>

187
00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:12.880
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you've listed there,</v>

188
00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:16.760
<v Speaker 3>you need to get up and say I want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>invoke some best for my parents,</v>

189
00:12:16.761 --> 00:12:17.150
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

190
00:12:17.151 --> 00:12:22.151
<v Speaker 3>come on my relationship with intimate </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then make it your business to tell </v>

191
00:12:23.271 --> 00:12:28.271
<v Speaker 3>him what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then she would come up with some </v>

192
00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:30.881
<v Speaker 3>other ideas or some other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's my duty to come in and go,</v>

193
00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:37.570
<v Speaker 3>so this limit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then it's the Medina Muslims extent </v>

194
00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.540
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not the only one that other </v>
<v Speaker 3>scholars like.</v>

195
00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:48.510
<v Speaker 3>There are many others who have </v>
<v Speaker 3>preserving a position as a culture,</v>

196
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:59.970
<v Speaker 3>as a civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and at the same time putting this </v>

197
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:04.200
<v Speaker 3>violence and providing courses within </v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam.</v>

198
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.140
<v Speaker 3>If you're trying to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you'll go to see your way to make a</v>

199
00:13:09.141 --> 00:13:14.141
<v Speaker 3>list of all the concepts that we really </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have any problem with.</v>

200
00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:22.690
<v Speaker 3>People being told to pay five times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is letter of cost in the market and</v>

201
00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:28.980
<v Speaker 3>also they just don't have a problem with</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of that data that's been referenced </v>

202
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:33.420
<v Speaker 3>to the early days in Medina.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As you said,</v>

203
00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:35.750
<v Speaker 3>a political philosophy.</v>

204
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:43.030
<v Speaker 3>Mohammed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just wars because he would spend and </v>

205
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:45.890
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly where was successful and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that Islam is to end and they say,</v>

206
00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:53.370
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

207
00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:56.360
<v Speaker 4>to be,</v>

208
00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:58.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be emulating.</v>

209
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:05.170
<v Speaker 3>So that's I think where the public </v>
<v Speaker 3>market that we apply in the social </v>

210
00:14:11.241 --> 00:14:15.720
<v Speaker 3>sciences has its problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this simplifies because it focuses,</v>

211
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:17.030
<v Speaker 3>it should work.</v>

212
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see this as an externally </v>

213
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:25.230
<v Speaker 1>applied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

214
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:29.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a category system essentially that </v>

215
00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:29.270
<v Speaker 1>that's useful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's useful for,</v>

216
00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:34.620
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for outsiders who were trying to assess </v>

217
00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.561
<v Speaker 1>the situation to determine who it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're dealing with that might be </v>

218
00:14:37.961 --> 00:14:40.180
<v Speaker 1>regarded as an ally and who it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with.</v>

219
00:14:40.181 --> 00:14:42.280
<v Speaker 1>It might be regarded as a fold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

220
00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:44.560
<v Speaker 1>and that would be on the more militant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to have things that,</v>

221
00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:45.200
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

222
00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.290
<v Speaker 1>that's a reasonable way of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

223
00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:53.660
<v Speaker 3>That's reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a reasonable way of looking at </v>

224
00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:53.660
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you take</v>

225
00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.890
<v Speaker 2>the moderates versus extreme </v>
<v Speaker 2>classification or categorization,</v>

226
00:14:56.310 --> 00:15:00.570
<v Speaker 2>that has become common place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't tell you what,</v>

227
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:05.620
<v Speaker 2>when we look at model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we think of people who are not using </v>

228
00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.020
<v Speaker 2>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you look at Medina,</v>

229
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:12.440
<v Speaker 2>you will see that there are hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of Muslims who do not apply </v>

230
00:15:13.171 --> 00:15:17.030
<v Speaker 2>violence now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but who do preach about this and they do</v>

231
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:22.090
<v Speaker 2>preach the Medina legacies and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave that Sharia should be instituted </v>

232
00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:26.870
<v Speaker 2>and in places where they get where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get a majority of these violent and </v>

233
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:31.720
<v Speaker 2>ideally types,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then suddenly they apply and forces </v>

234
00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.950
<v Speaker 2>Sharia alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think the terms model is an extreme</v>

235
00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.490
<v Speaker 2>are just not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't cover.</v>

236
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:43.990
<v Speaker 1>They also seem to bear any relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the internal dynamics of the faith </v>

237
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.460
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whatever.</v>

238
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.550
<v Speaker 2>That's also problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

239
00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:51.570
<v Speaker 2>So does that because you have to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>going back to the theology.</v>

240
00:15:51.731 --> 00:15:55.510
<v Speaker 2>You have to keep going back to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>internal debate among Muslims,</v>

241
00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.070
<v Speaker 2>how to move on and how to relate to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>test.</v>

242
00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:03.980
<v Speaker 2>So I personally think Mecca and Medina </v>
<v Speaker 2>is much more useful as a tool,</v>

243
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:09.430
<v Speaker 2>as an external conceptual framework for </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding the problem we face with </v>

244
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:13.300
<v Speaker 2>Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then extreme versus freshwater and all </v>

245
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:13.310
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

246
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:17.480
<v Speaker 2>all the other terms that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me ask you another question about</v>

247
00:16:17.481 --> 00:16:18.890
<v Speaker 2>that then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So see,</v>

248
00:16:18.891 --> 00:16:20.360
<v Speaker 2>one of the problems that I've had</v>

249
00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:25.800
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] I've been trying to look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the potential for true relationship </v>

250
00:16:26.141 --> 00:16:27.910
<v Speaker 1>between Islam and Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

251
00:16:27.911 --> 00:16:30.340
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that I understand Islam or</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity,</v>

252
00:16:30.341 --> 00:16:33.190
<v Speaker 1>which of course there's plenty to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand about both,</v>

253
00:16:33.191 --> 00:16:36.640
<v Speaker 1>so it's no easy thing to manage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is this claim as well that,</v>

254
00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.550
<v Speaker 1>that that's widespread and rather vague </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

255
00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.670
<v Speaker 1>that Islam is in essence a religion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>peace.</v>

256
00:16:42.671 --> 00:16:45.670
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I look at the historical data,</v>

257
00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:49.240
<v Speaker 1>say stemming from Medina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Medina time,</v>

258
00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:54.450
<v Speaker 1>and then moving forward and the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that Mohammed was definitely </v>

259
00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:57.970
<v Speaker 1>someone who engaged personally in </v>
<v Speaker 1>warfare and in expansionist warfare,</v>

260
00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:03.150
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not an easy thing for me to make </v>

261
00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:03.150
<v Speaker 1>the leap to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

262
00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:07.980
<v Speaker 1>to see comprehending or being able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>accept the claim that the fundamental </v>

263
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.570
<v Speaker 1>doctrines of Islam are peaceful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

264
00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:11.200
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are associated with peace.</v>

265
00:17:11.201 --> 00:17:14.260
<v Speaker 1>Because it looks to me like there's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>element of it that's quite militaristic.</v>

266
00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:18.820
<v Speaker 1>And I've also thought that let's say </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a religious element to Islam.</v>

267
00:17:18.821 --> 00:17:20.290
<v Speaker 1>And I mean this is not an original </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>

268
00:17:20.291 --> 00:17:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Obviously there's a religious element to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam,</v>

269
00:17:22.361 --> 00:17:27.361
<v Speaker 1>but there's also something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly more like a political movement </v>

270
00:17:27.361 --> 00:17:30.931
<v Speaker 1>and more like a governmental movement </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's also complicated by the fact </v>

271
00:17:30.931 --> 00:17:35.041
<v Speaker 1>that there isn't any clear separation </v>
<v Speaker 1>between church and state in Islamic </v>

272
00:17:35.041 --> 00:17:37.750
<v Speaker 1>doctrine as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when we hear claims that are,</v>

273
00:17:37.751 --> 00:17:41.200
<v Speaker 1>when claims are made that Islam is </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially a religion of peace,</v>

274
00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:44.710
<v Speaker 1>then that doesn't seem to be the case </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Medina,</v>

275
00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:50.280
<v Speaker 1>end of the theological discourse or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actions that that emerged there of and </v>

276
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:55.071
<v Speaker 1>then part of the problem is how do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>reconcile that with the contradictions </v>

277
00:17:55.071 --> 00:17:56.490
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to the earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>

278
00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:01.580
<v Speaker 1>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meccan doctrines and it isn't clear to </v>

279
00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:01.580
<v Speaker 1>me how that can be done so</v>

280
00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:07.230
<v Speaker 2>as a political force obligated to </v>
<v Speaker 2>enforce it.</v>

281
00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:12.460
<v Speaker 2>So number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did not give have his message.</v>

282
00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:26.760
<v Speaker 2>You guys are worshiping false gods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these that you live in a time and I'd </v>

283
00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:32.610
<v Speaker 2>like to and come work with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>

284
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:41.710
<v Speaker 2>these peaceful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>peaceful.</v>

285
00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:45.370
<v Speaker 2>It's because he applied for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't personally.</v>

286
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:50.390
<v Speaker 2>Do you have an attacker describe </v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves in Levina then?</v>

287
00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:59.590
<v Speaker 2>He does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was in the war and the numbers with</v>

288
00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:07.010
<v Speaker 2>Muslims and these are people who come </v>
<v Speaker 2>from with them by then.</v>

289
00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:11.320
<v Speaker 2>Then the says everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever that is,</v>

290
00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:17.160
<v Speaker 2>destination is only after you accept </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam as long as you refuse to abide by </v>

291
00:19:20.441 --> 00:19:24.670
<v Speaker 2>Islamic law or accept to be subdued by </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam,</v>

292
00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.470
<v Speaker 2>you are at war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they.</v>

293
00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:30.830
<v Speaker 2>The Medina is make this distinction </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the house of Islam piece and the</v>

294
00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:35.880
<v Speaker 2>horrors of war is everywhere where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're introduced and it's the job of </v>

295
00:19:36.461 --> 00:19:38.970
<v Speaker 2>the Muslims in the house feed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>congrats.</v>

296
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:44.900
<v Speaker 1>So it's a religion of peace in so far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's final utopian aim is the cessation </v>

297
00:19:45.061 --> 00:19:50.061
<v Speaker 1>of conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the cessation of conflict in </v>

298
00:19:50.061 --> 00:19:51.800
<v Speaker 1>part as a consequence of of conquests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

299
00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:52.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

300
00:19:52.381 --> 00:19:54.300
<v Speaker 1>Well that was more or less how I </v>
<v Speaker 1>understood it.</v>

301
00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.270
<v Speaker 1>So when the claim is made that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion of peace,</v>

302
00:19:57.271 --> 00:20:01.410
<v Speaker 1>then that isn't precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a slight of hand in some sense.</v>

303
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.690
<v Speaker 1>With regards specifically to that phrase</v>

304
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:09.110
<v Speaker 2>that are individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was I skype as maker will say when </v>

305
00:20:09.391 --> 00:20:13.970
<v Speaker 2>they say what they really wanted to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>peaceful individual,</v>

306
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:19.360
<v Speaker 2>no problems with other religions and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to be engaged with any politics or </v>

307
00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:22.930
<v Speaker 2>to link politics with religion please.</v>

308
00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:24.490
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

309
00:20:24.491 --> 00:20:29.491
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that I wouldn't say it wouldn't be </v>

310
00:20:29.491 --> 00:20:29.491
<v Speaker 1>the majority of Muslims worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure you agree with that,</v>

311
00:20:29.491 --> 00:20:34.111
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me that it isn't self </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidently the case that the majority of </v>

312
00:20:34.111 --> 00:20:38.221
<v Speaker 1>human beings are violent and war like </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so my sense is is that given the </v>

313
00:20:39.161 --> 00:20:41.800
<v Speaker 1>essential peace peacefulness of most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

314
00:20:41.801 --> 00:20:46.801
<v Speaker 1>they're going to take a look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamic doctrine and extract from it </v>

315
00:20:46.801 --> 00:20:48.470
<v Speaker 1>those elements that are supportive of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that more individual pace,</v>

316
00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:53.650
<v Speaker 1>but that still leaves open the question </v>
<v Speaker 1>of exactly what the doctrine means as a </v>

317
00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:56.270
<v Speaker 1>set of motivational principles and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be a big part of the current</v>

318
00:20:56.271 --> 00:20:59.300
<v Speaker 1>problem and also the need for current </v>
<v Speaker 1>discourse.</v>

319
00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:04.420
<v Speaker 1>What I would hope is that it would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible to undertake a dialogue with </v>

320
00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:06.110
<v Speaker 1>Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say between Islam and the West are</v>

321
00:21:06.111 --> 00:21:10.460
<v Speaker 1>between Islam and Judeo Christianity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>defined within Islam itself.</v>

322
00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:15.730
<v Speaker 1>The seeds that would enable that </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialogue to occur so that some sort of </v>

323
00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.440
<v Speaker 1>long term negotiated conceptual and </v>
<v Speaker 1>practical piece could be attained,</v>

324
00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:23.980
<v Speaker 1>but the more I've read about Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more difficult it is for me to </v>

325
00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:27.011
<v Speaker 1>understand how that might be managed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially because of it's because of </v>

326
00:21:27.011 --> 00:21:31.091
<v Speaker 1>the war like tradition that emerged from</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Medina and then move outward in at </v>

327
00:21:31.091 --> 00:21:35.591
<v Speaker 1>a staggering rate from that and also the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that's quite quite disconcerting </v>

328
00:21:35.591 --> 00:21:38.060
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not like Christianity hasn't</v>

329
00:21:38.061 --> 00:21:43.061
<v Speaker 1>been rife with internal divisions like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that between the steps and the </v>

330
00:21:43.061 --> 00:21:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Catholics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also was the case that what you </v>

331
00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.400
<v Speaker 1>might describe as the civil war that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>been occurring within Islam,</v>

332
00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:51.620
<v Speaker 1>more or less started as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell,</v>

333
00:21:51.621 --> 00:21:56.621
<v Speaker 1>more or less started that day that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mohammed died and has never stopped </v>

334
00:21:56.621 --> 00:21:59.921
<v Speaker 1>since that and that also seems to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well obviously it's a problem for the </v>

335
00:21:59.921 --> 00:22:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Islamic community itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also seems to be a problem,</v>

336
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:07.390
<v Speaker 1>an increasing problem for the west </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we can't not be tangled up in </v>

337
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:07.390
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

338
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:12.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We we have to share the planet with one </v>

339
00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.590
<v Speaker 2>fifth of humanity and it's very clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>that things have to change and that's is</v>

340
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:20.750
<v Speaker 2>the beauty of Muslims to change the </v>
<v Speaker 2>theological underpinnings of their </v>

341
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:24.910
<v Speaker 2>religion and as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is being pushed by those that I </v>

342
00:22:25.751 --> 00:22:30.751
<v Speaker 2>call the farmers or modifies and these </v>
<v Speaker 2>are individuals maybe now a little </v>

343
00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:36.940
<v Speaker 2>bigger groups are forming views and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe even being led by some nation </v>

344
00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:42.690
<v Speaker 2>state for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The big question is either going to </v>

345
00:22:45.701 --> 00:22:50.701
<v Speaker 2>agree on what to change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is in built into Islam is this </v>

346
00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:56.160
<v Speaker 2>idea that you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm submit edits to the Koran and it's </v>

347
00:22:59.651 --> 00:23:00.430
<v Speaker 2>the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

348
00:23:00.431 --> 00:23:05.431
<v Speaker 2>Mohammed was a by Muslims as infallible </v>
<v Speaker 2>as somebody who never made a mistake.</v>

349
00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:12.450
<v Speaker 2>So it's an uphill battle for those </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims who are seeking modernization to</v>

350
00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.160
<v Speaker 2>agree on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

351
00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:23.190
<v Speaker 2>how to edit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to persuade Muslims to accept a </v>

352
00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:28.620
<v Speaker 2>truly peaceful right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a truly tolerant idea of religion </v>

353
00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:33.601
<v Speaker 2>that separates religion from politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>respects the rights of women or people </v>

354
00:23:33.601 --> 00:23:38.210
<v Speaker 2>of other faiths and people within Islam </v>
<v Speaker 2>who voted to leave their faith.</v>

355
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:42.760
<v Speaker 2>So how do you get the theological </v>
<v Speaker 2>underpinnings for that?</v>

356
00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's within his lap.</v>

357
00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:49.900
<v Speaker 1>The danger there too is that when that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing is attempted,</v>

358
00:23:49.901 --> 00:23:52.570
<v Speaker 1>often reformed from within a religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>

359
00:23:52.571 --> 00:23:57.010
<v Speaker 1>one of the dangers there is that instead</v>
<v Speaker 1>of reforming it peacefully,</v>

360
00:23:57.011 --> 00:23:59.830
<v Speaker 1>all you do is add another sect to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>court.</v>

361
00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:01.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For us secular people,</v>

362
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:05.730
<v Speaker 2>it seems from from a distance it seems </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of easy to say,</v>

363
00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:11.030
<v Speaker 2>well why don't they just separate </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion from politics and to they just,</v>

364
00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:15.230
<v Speaker 2>they can be religious to look at it that</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

365
00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:20.250
<v Speaker 2>Simplistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because then you get people who want to </v>

366
00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:20.250
<v Speaker 2>be religious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These Medina subset,</v>

367
00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:25.400
<v Speaker 2>what do you say for Medina was an </v>
<v Speaker 2>expression of his muslimness is to </v>

368
00:24:26.791 --> 00:24:31.791
<v Speaker 2>convert to Islam to kill me as opposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to if it's to get women to cover up,</v>

369
00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:36.010
<v Speaker 2>it's to keep warning us about life life </v>
<v Speaker 2>today and all of that.</v>

370
00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:39.700
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the thing that made me,</v>

371
00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:44.930
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say nervous to some degree </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the perspective of someone who </v>

372
00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:48.430
<v Speaker 1>analyzes totalitarian ideology because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing about totalitarian ideology is</v>

373
00:24:48.431 --> 00:24:50.530
<v Speaker 1>it tends to be totalitarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

374
00:24:50.531 --> 00:24:55.531
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely all consuming and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>why also when I've been assessing,</v>

375
00:24:56.381 --> 00:25:01.381
<v Speaker 1>because I've done a fair bit of research</v>
<v Speaker 1>into comparative religion and done my </v>

376
00:25:01.381 --> 00:25:05.251
<v Speaker 1>best to expand my knowledge base and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always had a hard time with Islam </v>

377
00:25:05.741 --> 00:25:10.741
<v Speaker 1>in that regard because it's difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me to extract out the purely </v>

378
00:25:10.741 --> 00:25:14.761
<v Speaker 1>religious elements and to compare them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to let's say religious sentiments that </v>

379
00:25:14.761 --> 00:25:19.021
<v Speaker 1>have emerged across across humankind and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of different times and arrows </v>

380
00:25:19.021 --> 00:25:23.250
<v Speaker 1>and to separate that from the political </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctrine and sometimes I'm tempted to </v>

381
00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:25.140
<v Speaker 1>think more that Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

382
00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:30.150
<v Speaker 1>broadly and vaguely speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is something much more like a political </v>

383
00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:30.580
<v Speaker 1>movement than it is in fact like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious movement.</v>

384
00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.350
<v Speaker 2>It is a political theory and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>political movement.</v>

385
00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:38.380
<v Speaker 2>It started out even in Mecca in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>early days come to my board,</v>

386
00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:42.010
<v Speaker 2>which was a political message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a religious message,</v>

387
00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:47.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even in the early days in it was </v>

388
00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:49.760
<v Speaker 2>absolute is Islam by its nature is </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely just because it a complete </v>

389
00:25:50.151 --> 00:25:55.100
<v Speaker 2>and total submission of the individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>to God and in Medina.</v>

390
00:25:55.250 --> 00:26:00.250
<v Speaker 2>Mohammed came around with a political,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a blueprint for how society ought to </v>

391
00:26:02.091 --> 00:26:07.091
<v Speaker 2>live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the relationship between the individual </v>

392
00:26:07.091 --> 00:26:07.850
<v Speaker 2>and the relationship between men and </v>
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

393
00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:12.900
<v Speaker 2>husband and wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the relationship between parent and </v>

394
00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.761
<v Speaker 2>child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the relationship between the government </v>

395
00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:23.060
<v Speaker 2>and the subjects and their duties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has a court system.</v>

396
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:28.090
<v Speaker 2>It has a military system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so from the very beginning it was more </v>

397
00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:34.010
<v Speaker 2>political theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As we understand the agent today,</v>

398
00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:37.370
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ founded his religion within</v>
<v Speaker 2>an empire.</v>

399
00:26:37.371 --> 00:26:42.371
<v Speaker 2>The Roman empire existed before and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about was all religions.</v>

400
00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.530
<v Speaker 2>Mohammed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we forget.</v>

401
00:26:46.531 --> 00:26:46.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

402
00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.550
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

403
00:26:47.551 --> 00:26:50.100
<v Speaker 1>That's a very important distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean really,</v>

404
00:26:50.101 --> 00:26:52.800
<v Speaker 1>and it might be the crucial distinction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

405
00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:59.740
<v Speaker 2>and there was this empire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>empire bows and decline and fell and </v>

406
00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.150
<v Speaker 2>those who feel that they have inherited </v>
<v Speaker 2>that legacy.</v>

407
00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:07.360
<v Speaker 2>They want to go back to the days of </v>
<v Speaker 2>employment for about 20 days when Islam </v>

408
00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:12.650
<v Speaker 2>was supremely and they want to do this </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the 21st century.</v>

409
00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:15.690
<v Speaker 2>All kinds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just.</v>

410
00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:20.790
<v Speaker 2>You can't come on horseback and inmate </v>
<v Speaker 2>and existing client like the Indian </v>

411
00:27:25.221 --> 00:27:28.210
<v Speaker 2>empire that they took over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could just take things also.</v>

412
00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.200
<v Speaker 2>It's not like la,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're driven,</v>

413
00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:36.040
<v Speaker 2>they're convinced they have this legacy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're not afraid of it and is key </v>

414
00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:42.220
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and here's why I keep going back to that</v>

415
00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:48.300
<v Speaker 2>life on this temporal and that there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something in the after this.</v>

416
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.530
<v Speaker 2>There's no point in investing in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>life accepting that nature,</v>

417
00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:58.240
<v Speaker 2>so for the Medina Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really becomes easy to recruit and </v>

418
00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:03.250
<v Speaker 2>inspire into their parents' Muslims who </v>
<v Speaker 2>have already been taught that they've </v>

419
00:28:04.941 --> 00:28:09.941
<v Speaker 2>only got to work for the hereafter </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems with Islam and I think it was </v>

420
00:28:09.941 --> 00:28:14.850
<v Speaker 2>would understand of course the basic lms</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Mohammed Straw with all of the Koran </v>

421
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:21.750
<v Speaker 2>before all of the heat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after all of these things and what </v>

422
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:23.210
<v Speaker 2>Sharia law really means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it gets to the past.</v>

423
00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:27.530
<v Speaker 2>This is how they managed to teach young </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

424
00:28:27.531 --> 00:28:32.531
<v Speaker 2>How do they manage to teachable or these</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands and millions of people who is </v>

425
00:28:32.531 --> 00:28:34.040
<v Speaker 2>subsidizing this countries like Saudi </v>
<v Speaker 2>Arabia,</v>

426
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:35.550
<v Speaker 2>Qatar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

427
00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:41.010
<v Speaker 2>Understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that makes oUr job as western </v>

428
00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:42.700
<v Speaker 2>whatever's easiest.</v>

429
00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.880
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about the saudis for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>

430
00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:47.750
<v Speaker 1>The elephant under the western carpet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

431
00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:51.930
<v Speaker 1>I understand that in the aftermath of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the oil crisis in the 19 seventies,</v>

432
00:28:51.931 --> 00:28:56.931
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that that dictated </v>
<v Speaker 1>american foreign policy was the desire </v>

433
00:28:56.931 --> 00:29:00.591
<v Speaker 1>to maintain stable oil production and </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can understand that although I </v>

434
00:29:00.591 --> 00:29:00.940
<v Speaker 1>think it was short sighted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can.</v>

435
00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:06.050
<v Speaker 1>I can see the logic in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very difficult for me to see </v>

436
00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:10.700
<v Speaker 1>that in any possible way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The saudis can be regarded as true </v>

437
00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:14.271
<v Speaker 1>allies of the west and so I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand why we have the relationship </v>

438
00:29:15.631 --> 00:29:18.040
<v Speaker 1>that we do have with the saudis given.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

439
00:29:18.041 --> 00:29:23.041
<v Speaker 1>they were pumping literally trillions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars every about every decade into </v>

440
00:29:23.041 --> 00:29:27.681
<v Speaker 1>the economy and then given that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice a particularly pernicious form </v>

441
00:29:27.681 --> 00:29:30.900
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say viciously militant islam and</v>

442
00:29:30.901 --> 00:29:34.350
<v Speaker 1>second or third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that is that they're pumping out</v>

443
00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:39.650
<v Speaker 1>propaganda that pushes this wahhabi </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint in massive doses everywhere in</v>

444
00:29:39.841 --> 00:29:40.650
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

445
00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:45.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe this is also part of the </v>

446
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:46.450
<v Speaker 1>complexity with regards to western </v>
<v Speaker 1>attitudes towards,</v>

447
00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:51.810
<v Speaker 1>towards the complex problem of islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand why the west doesn't </v>

448
00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:56.761
<v Speaker 1>do more to put a stop to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what are your thoughts about </v>

449
00:29:56.761 --> 00:29:57.370
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does it look to you?</v>

450
00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:03.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm perplexed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that the south would have </v>

451
00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:04.100
<v Speaker 2>booked the United States and other </v>
<v Speaker 2>western business under this.</v>

452
00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.030
<v Speaker 2>Someone has to come along and break </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

453
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:08.640
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

454
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:09.510
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

455
00:30:09.511 --> 00:30:13.410
<v Speaker 2>I agree with everything you said within </v>
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia,</v>

456
00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:19.420
<v Speaker 2>I believe at least three forces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the royal family who I believe now </v>

457
00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:25.560
<v Speaker 2>sexier and more modern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to go down the larger,</v>

458
00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:32.480
<v Speaker 2>incredibly powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe even more powerful than the oil </v>

459
00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:36.240
<v Speaker 2>because the clergy in Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have the power to put into people's</v>

460
00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:45.380
<v Speaker 2>heads and hearts the wahhabi doctrine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's all about Saudi Arabia here.</v>

461
00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:52.770
<v Speaker 2>People who decide what's right or what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>

462
00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:55.840
<v Speaker 2>moral other time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

463
00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:59.270
<v Speaker 2>They have that powerful and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the trach,</v>

464
00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:04.310
<v Speaker 2>the various stripes who obviously </v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on their size of royal family </v>

465
00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:11.850
<v Speaker 2>or the clergy or both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a dynamic there that is very </v>

466
00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:14.430
<v Speaker 2>interesting to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in that sense,</v>

467
00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:20.060
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia has used and has indulged </v>
<v Speaker 2>as larger established legacy Saudi </v>

468
00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:25.890
<v Speaker 2>Arabia.</v>

469
00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:32.390
<v Speaker 2>People medina inside the borders of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia and tyler.</v>

470
00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:38.280
<v Speaker 2>Yup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now I think we the United States and</v>

471
00:31:38.281 --> 00:31:43.281
<v Speaker 2>other countries who need to be mad from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the saudi royal family because they are </v>

472
00:31:43.281 --> 00:31:47.951
<v Speaker 2>the ones who are political,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least the political individuals that </v>

473
00:31:47.951 --> 00:31:52.161
<v Speaker 2>we did with tj and say we need a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different between the house and the </v>

474
00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:59.950
<v Speaker 2>house of will happen because these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are really destroyed.</v>

475
00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:05.180
<v Speaker 2>The planet vape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just said you have to think through </v>

476
00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:06.870
<v Speaker 2>what these people have done in south </v>
<v Speaker 2>asia,</v>

477
00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:10.020
<v Speaker 2>in africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all over the world.</v>

478
00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:15.480
<v Speaker 2>It's the duty of a part of it swells to </v>
<v Speaker 2>discredit this lab,</v>

479
00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:23.490
<v Speaker 2>this lab that is through institutions </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is.</v>

480
00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:28.720
<v Speaker 2>This is therefore policies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>we probably could refer that to a soft </v>

481
00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:29.880
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where the cloud,</v>

482
00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:32.090
<v Speaker 2>but that if you look at what is </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening,</v>

483
00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:37.190
<v Speaker 2>all these terrorist activities across </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people wanting sheree about all of </v>

484
00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:42.880
<v Speaker 2>soda really is behind it and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>staying with that.</v>

485
00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:43.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

486
00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:45.440
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let me run a theory by you.</v>

487
00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:50.860
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a twofold theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one is that there's a paternalistic </v>

488
00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:56.120
<v Speaker 1>attitude in the west towards the saudis </v>
<v Speaker 1>that stems from perhaps events that were</v>

489
00:32:56.450 --> 00:33:01.450
<v Speaker 1>as far back as 100 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the paternalistic aspect is to </v>

490
00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:04.430
<v Speaker 1>underestimate them as enemies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

491
00:33:04.431 --> 00:33:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Because you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

492
00:33:05.271 --> 00:33:10.271
<v Speaker 1>we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we need the oil and we're going to </v>

493
00:33:10.271 --> 00:33:11.090
<v Speaker 1>stabilize it and maybe that we'd rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>not have chaos in Saudi Arabia.</v>

494
00:33:11.091 --> 00:33:16.091
<v Speaker 1>And so unknown dictator is better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown chaos and we saw some proof of </v>

495
00:33:16.371 --> 00:33:18.290
<v Speaker 1>that perhaps in what happened with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Libya,</v>

496
00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:23.680
<v Speaker 1>but so the idea would be there's nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently dangerous about the saudis </v>

497
00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:26.090
<v Speaker 1>to justify us destabilizing their </v>
<v Speaker 1>regime,</v>

498
00:33:26.091 --> 00:33:28.640
<v Speaker 1>especially when we're particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent on their oil.</v>

499
00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:33.770
<v Speaker 1>And then underneath that would be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>underestimation of the danger of ideas.</v>

500
00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:38.920
<v Speaker 1>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when ideas are combined with </v>

501
00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:38.920
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

502
00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:43.060
<v Speaker 1>So because the saudis in some sense I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think are are fighting what you might </v>

503
00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:46.931
<v Speaker 1>regard as a stealth war against the weSt</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're doing it by convincing </v>

504
00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:50.930
<v Speaker 1>upcoming generations of the rightness of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their particular viewpoint.</v>

505
00:33:50.931 --> 00:33:53.510
<v Speaker 1>And so they're in it for the long haul </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense.</v>

506
00:33:53.511 --> 00:33:56.210
<v Speaker 1>And I think we're radically </v>
<v Speaker 1>underestimating the danger of that and</v>

507
00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:59.870
<v Speaker 2>it's quite logical law and we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

508
00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:04.930
<v Speaker 2>we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have to think when the soviet</v>

509
00:34:04.931 --> 00:34:09.931
<v Speaker 2>union was around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we hadn't done anything interest was </v>

510
00:34:09.931 --> 00:34:14.080
<v Speaker 2>viewed that in economic terms for in </v>
<v Speaker 2>military terms and that is not just </v>

511
00:34:14.611 --> 00:34:19.611
<v Speaker 2>telling rabia is even Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these countries are waging an </v>

512
00:34:20.921 --> 00:34:25.890
<v Speaker 2>ideological war and we're not because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they believe,</v>

513
00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:31.040
<v Speaker 2>well it's religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Religion is proTected and we don't talk </v>

514
00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:35.281
<v Speaker 2>about religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's one thing we believe we're </v>

515
00:34:35.281 --> 00:34:36.760
<v Speaker 2>under the spell of these incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>charming.</v>

516
00:34:36.761 --> 00:34:41.761
<v Speaker 2>So that's come to attend our </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities that have the emphasis and </v>

517
00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:46.880
<v Speaker 2>that reassure us that they're more </v>
<v Speaker 2>westernized than we can tell them how </v>

518
00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:51.170
<v Speaker 2>they treat their women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in a way I think,</v>

519
00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:56.400
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just keep going back and say we are </v>

520
00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.501
<v Speaker 2>under some sort of spell and at some </v>
<v Speaker 2>point someone has to come and break that</v>

521
00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:03.780
<v Speaker 2>spell globalization to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

522
00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:06.830
<v Speaker 2>a Saudi Arabia opens up to the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>economy.</v>

523
00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:12.210
<v Speaker 2>We really see what was on Inside their </v>
<v Speaker 2>own country and inside all of these </v>

524
00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:16.780
<v Speaker 2>other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the people,</v>

525
00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:19.040
<v Speaker 2>the canadian people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>western people pushes.</v>

526
00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:24.420
<v Speaker 2>And say no to and the amount from their </v>
<v Speaker 2>documents that they engage with Saudi </v>

527
00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.110
<v Speaker 2>Arabia in a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

528
00:35:26.111 --> 00:35:26.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

529
00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the thIngs I really can't figure </v>

530
00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:32.931
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could shed some light on this </v>

531
00:35:32.931 --> 00:35:32.931
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you know,</v>

532
00:35:32.931 --> 00:35:35.811
<v Speaker 1>of all the things that women's political</v>
<v Speaker 1>movements should be doing in the west is</v>

533
00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:39.960
<v Speaker 1>demanding as far as I can tell that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>western countries,</v>

534
00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:45.020
<v Speaker 1>let's say lead by their male rulers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop treating the saudis like are there </v>

535
00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:49.101
<v Speaker 1>are allies and I cannot understand why </v>
<v Speaker 1>there hasn't been a concerted pressure </v>

536
00:35:49.101 --> 00:35:52.620
<v Speaker 1>put on western governments by women who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are concerned,</v>

537
00:35:52.621 --> 00:35:56.520
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle with the equality </v>
<v Speaker 1>and freedom of women around the world to</v>

538
00:35:56.521 --> 00:35:59.160
<v Speaker 1>stop treating the saudis like they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>our allies.</v>

539
00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:04.310
<v Speaker 1>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another thing that perplexes me </v>

540
00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:06.831
<v Speaker 1>entirely in the cynical part of me </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks that the feminists who are more </v>

541
00:36:06.841 --> 00:36:11.841
<v Speaker 1>or less hell bent on the destruction of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the western patriarchy adopt the </v>

542
00:36:11.841 --> 00:36:13.230
<v Speaker 1>attitude that the enemy of my enemy is </v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend.</v>

543
00:36:13.231 --> 00:36:15.360
<v Speaker 1>And so they're willing to put up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the saudis do.</v>

544
00:36:15.361 --> 00:36:17.820
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think that's a sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation.</v>

545
00:36:17.821 --> 00:36:21.240
<v Speaker 1>So I mean you can view our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our culture,</v>

546
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:26.390
<v Speaker 1>so to speak a little bit from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the outside position because you </v>

547
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:29.701
<v Speaker 1>haven't moved in as an immigrant and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that gives you a viewpoint that it's </v>

548
00:36:29.701 --> 00:36:30.420
<v Speaker 1>much more difficult for someone within </v>
<v Speaker 1>it to share.</v>

549
00:36:30.421 --> 00:36:35.421
<v Speaker 1>And so like what do you see as as </v>
<v Speaker 1>driving the absence of pressure,</v>

550
00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:39.210
<v Speaker 1>let's say from women on governments in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to these,</v>

551
00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:42.690
<v Speaker 1>I would say reprehensible dictatorships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

552
00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:48.220
<v Speaker 2>So the pre occupied with western country</v>
<v Speaker 2>after,</v>

553
00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:53.410
<v Speaker 2>with what I see is that they have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>festival that's focused only.</v>

554
00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:59.530
<v Speaker 2>They do not talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>discuss the issue of a man of color and </v>

555
00:37:00.771 --> 00:37:05.771
<v Speaker 2>the patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men of color or immigrants of the </v>

556
00:37:05.771 --> 00:37:06.680
<v Speaker 2>nations and countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

557
00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:08.540
<v Speaker 2>nations and countries outside.</v>

558
00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:14.110
<v Speaker 3>Oh the feminist to the identity politics</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was on multiculturalism and all </v>

559
00:37:22.531 --> 00:37:26.710
<v Speaker 3>these things are bad for women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>western women and bad.</v>

560
00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:32.600
<v Speaker 3>So if you believe take multiculturalism </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that so and the fasteners one since </v>

561
00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:48.690
<v Speaker 3>then they feel that they use to address</v>

562
00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:00.420
<v Speaker 2>greAt belief that black women and muslim</v>
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

563
00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:02.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women of color,</v>

564
00:38:02.071 --> 00:38:05.850
<v Speaker 2>if they wanted to get out of oppression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they should organize themselves.</v>

565
00:38:05.851 --> 00:38:10.851
<v Speaker 2>That's what they believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I find ironic is that sometimes we </v>

566
00:38:10.851 --> 00:38:15.111
<v Speaker 2>do organize ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am organized another ex muslim woman </v>

567
00:38:15.111 --> 00:38:19.370
<v Speaker 2>to talk about the misogyny that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>subjected to women in the white,</v>

568
00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:24.000
<v Speaker 2>white feminist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>atheist.</v>

569
00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.020
<v Speaker 2>And that's the biggest puzzle</v>

570
00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:27.570
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

571
00:38:27.571 --> 00:38:32.571
<v Speaker 1>I think that the treatment that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>received at the hands of western </v>

572
00:38:32.571 --> 00:38:32.571
<v Speaker 1>feminists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me that's,</v>

573
00:38:32.571 --> 00:38:36.890
<v Speaker 1>that's something that's just absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>it me absolutely speechless because</v>

574
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:39.670
<v Speaker 2>not only me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all of us.</v>

575
00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:43.330
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I could fall to excellence,</v>

576
00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:48.880
<v Speaker 2>but there are black women who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting for their rights and they all </v>

577
00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:48.880
<v Speaker 2>get shut down.</v>

578
00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:52.150
<v Speaker 1>So we were talking about your treatment </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the hands,</v>

579
00:38:52.151 --> 00:38:55.540
<v Speaker 1>let's say a western feminists and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like I read infidel,</v>

580
00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:58.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very shortly after you published it,</v>

581
00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:01.360
<v Speaker 1>which I love that book man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as I read that,</v>

582
00:39:01.361 --> 00:39:02.500
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

583
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:07.510
<v Speaker 1>I used which hell yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

584
00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:12.810
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought your comment on your comments </v>

585
00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:15.901
<v Speaker 1>on viewing western culture from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective of an immigrant that was </v>

586
00:39:16.061 --> 00:39:18.440
<v Speaker 1>hungry for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for genuine education and,</v>

587
00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:23.530
<v Speaker 1>and your comments on your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your experience with the efficiency of </v>

588
00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:26.170
<v Speaker 1>the dutch state say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're sort of amazement at how well</v>

589
00:39:26.171 --> 00:39:27.130
<v Speaker 1>it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was just.</v>

590
00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:32.220
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was so remarkable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearheaded and I thought when I read </v>

591
00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:32.220
<v Speaker 1>infidel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

592
00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:36.931
<v Speaker 1>well this woman is immediately going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a hero to feminists everywhere </v>

593
00:39:36.931 --> 00:39:40.771
<v Speaker 1>because she's removed yourself from this</v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressive state and moved out into the </v>

594
00:39:40.771 --> 00:39:41.490
<v Speaker 1>world and become a powerful figure when.</v>

595
00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.350
<v Speaker 1>What was the probability of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like zero,</v>

596
00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:49.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that you suffered as a consequence </v>

597
00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:52.021
<v Speaker 1>of your beliefs and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you stood up forthrightly for them </v>

598
00:39:52.021 --> 00:39:53.560
<v Speaker 1>and I thought if you wanted to find a </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminist hero that you are certainly,</v>

599
00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:57.430
<v Speaker 1>you're certainly in the running man for </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly that.</v>

600
00:39:57.730 --> 00:40:00.910
<v Speaker 1>And then to see how you've been treated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

601
00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:03.190
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just makes my jaw drop,</v>

602
00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:08.220
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially what brandeis did was </v>

603
00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:09.880
<v Speaker 1>brandeis right where you were offered an</v>
<v Speaker 1>honorary phd and then they revoked it.</v>

604
00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:12.430
<v Speaker 1>That just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the.</v>

605
00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:14.500
<v Speaker 1>I think that was almost as </v>
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible,</v>

606
00:40:14.501 --> 00:40:19.501
<v Speaker 1>inactive cowardice as the west's basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>abandonment of solomon rushdie after the</v>

607
00:40:20.591 --> 00:40:25.591
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was put on his head and about </v>

608
00:40:25.591 --> 00:40:26.400
<v Speaker 1>equally dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was multicultural.</v>

609
00:40:26.401 --> 00:40:28.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

610
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:31.570
<v Speaker 1>my message,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my lifestyle and who I am,</v>

611
00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:35.380
<v Speaker 1>it said they find off the prevalent </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

612
00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:36.960
<v Speaker 1>It's against the law</v>

613
00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:43.540
<v Speaker 2>that western values as superior to </v>
<v Speaker 2>islamic law and islamic values.</v>

614
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:49.470
<v Speaker 2>Not to say that is to blast being in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>temples of multiculturalism today.</v>

615
00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:51.230
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

616
00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:54.600
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope a lot of people because it wasn't</v>

617
00:40:54.601 --> 00:40:59.601
<v Speaker 2>about what they think should happen for </v>
<v Speaker 2>victims of misogyny.</v>

618
00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:04.430
<v Speaker 2>I think it's all about the disciplines </v>
<v Speaker 2>that my wife's and my,</v>

619
00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:08.420
<v Speaker 2>my lIfe and my beliefs kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dissonance.</v>

620
00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:13.170
<v Speaker 2>They put these women in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're going to say,</v>

621
00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:15.900
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's horrible to be an american woman,</v>

622
00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:18.880
<v Speaker 2>and the misogyny in America is worse </v>
<v Speaker 2>than that.</v>

623
00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:20.310
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

624
00:41:20.311 --> 00:41:25.311
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sort of interfering with their,</v>

625
00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:26.340
<v Speaker 2>with their worldview.</v>

626
00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:30.760
<v Speaker 1>The claim that you're making there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like this and it's really,</v>

627
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:35.790
<v Speaker 1>it's a really vicious claim in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's something like the western </v>

628
00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:39.911
<v Speaker 1>feminists who are possessed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism and cultural relativism </v>

629
00:41:39.911 --> 00:41:43.840
<v Speaker 1>are willing to sacrifice the freedom and</v>
<v Speaker 1>equality of third world women in places </v>

630
00:41:44.721 --> 00:41:49.721
<v Speaker 1>like Saudi Arabia to maintain the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sanctity of their multicultural notion </v>

631
00:41:49.721 --> 00:41:51.860
<v Speaker 1>because that justifies their attack on </v>
<v Speaker 1>western patriarchy,</v>

632
00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:55.240
<v Speaker 1>so they're willing to use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

633
00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:56.610
<v Speaker 1>so that that's an absolutely</v>

634
00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:03.100
<v Speaker 2>immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are so many men who are coming </v>

635
00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:06.831
<v Speaker 2>from these societies as men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are not used to the equality of </v>

636
00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.810
<v Speaker 2>women inside the west.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

637
00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:13.230
<v Speaker 2>they're all women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>child marriages,</v>

638
00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:15.630
<v Speaker 2>female genital mutilation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honor killings,</v>

639
00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:20.900
<v Speaker 2>but now we have these crepes and sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>harassment of non muslim women and women</v>

640
00:42:22.891 --> 00:42:27.891
<v Speaker 2>keep on arguing for more integration and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't hear anything negative about </v>

641
00:42:29.371 --> 00:42:31.650
<v Speaker 2>some of the negative impacts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>immigration.</v>

642
00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:36.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't consider them feminists anyhow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that there are so much more </v>

643
00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:41.660
<v Speaker 2>committed to preserving their world view</v>
<v Speaker 2>their postmodern as well than they are </v>

644
00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:44.830
<v Speaker 2>to the rights of women and they're mean.</v>

645
00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:50.410
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's how it looks to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>is like this situation with Saudi Arabia</v>

646
00:42:50.451 --> 00:42:53.900
<v Speaker 1>is the one is the test case is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you might say,</v>

647
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:57.810
<v Speaker 1>are the postmodern feminists types are </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones who present themselves as.</v>

648
00:42:57.950 --> 00:43:01.880
<v Speaker 1>Are they more concerned with the rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>of women or are they more concerned with</v>

649
00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:07.030
<v Speaker 1>bringing down the so called tyranny of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the west and the answer is they're more </v>

650
00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:10.541
<v Speaker 1>concerned with the louder than they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the farmer because when you put </v>

651
00:43:10.541 --> 00:43:13.331
<v Speaker 1>them head to head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they dispense with the rights of women </v>

652
00:43:13.331 --> 00:43:16.930
<v Speaker 1>across the world as long as they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain their moral justification for </v>

653
00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:19.400
<v Speaker 1>the radical beliefs and I do think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is why they go after you because you're.</v>

654
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:24.670
<v Speaker 1>You're exacTly the reprehenSible </v>
<v Speaker 1>exemplar of what it is that they're </v>

655
00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:26.980
<v Speaker 1>attempting to deny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

656
00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:29.690
<v Speaker 1>and I think that does show their true </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations</v>

657
00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:32.320
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Out at the time.</v>

658
00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:35.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm guessing a lot of signals here that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I should.</v>

659
00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:41.140
<v Speaker 2>I should hang up now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I really enjoyed talking to you and </v>

660
00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:42.070
<v Speaker 2>I hope that in some way I've contributed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

661
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:44.220
<v Speaker 2>to the message that she wants to get out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

662
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:46.490
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll start with this,</v>

663
00:43:46.491 --> 00:43:48.860
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you 30 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just tell you what,</v>

664
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:53.950
<v Speaker 1>what are doing with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have arranged with a group of </v>

665
00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:57.401
<v Speaker 1>moderate muslims in Canada and some in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the us as well to start a series of </v>

666
00:43:57.401 --> 00:44:01.361
<v Speaker 1>dialogues like the one that we had today</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this isn't really viciously </v>

667
00:44:01.361 --> 00:44:04.400
<v Speaker 1>important problem and so I want to use </v>
<v Speaker 1>this as the opener for that.</v>

668
00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:09.460
<v Speaker 1>I would like to go after this issue of </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not a real dialogue could be </v>

669
00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:13.691
<v Speaker 1>begun between the judeo Christian West </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the islam world with some hope of </v>

670
00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:18.290
<v Speaker 1>not having all of this evolved into </v>
<v Speaker 1>endless and continual warfare because as</v>

671
00:44:18.291 --> 00:44:19.970
<v Speaker 1>far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where it's headed.</v>

672
00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:23.220
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where it's headed.</v>

673
00:44:23.221 --> 00:44:25.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well go get a chance to talk again.</v>

674
00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:30.290
<v Speaker 2>Thank you so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

675
00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:31.920
<v Speaker 2>Bye bye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bye bye.</v>
