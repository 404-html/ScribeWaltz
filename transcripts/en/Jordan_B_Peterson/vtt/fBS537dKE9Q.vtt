1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:08.883
<v Speaker 2>it's great to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be back in October last year and then </v>

3
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:14.523
<v Speaker 2>made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've now made two documentaries about </v>

4
00:00:15.761 --> 00:00:16.594
<v Speaker 2>you and a big focus for rebel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wisdom is kind of making sense of the </v>

5
00:00:22.061 --> 00:00:22.894
<v Speaker 2>cultural moment and making sense of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>success and what it represents and I </v>

6
00:00:27.731 --> 00:00:28.564
<v Speaker 2>don't know if you remember the very </v>
<v Speaker 2>first question I asked you back in </v>

7
00:00:30.161 --> 00:00:30.994
<v Speaker 2>October in the interview was firstly </v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you make of your success so far </v>

8
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.640
<v Speaker 2>and are you ready for it to continue?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I had.</v>

9
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.503
<v Speaker 2>I had a sense back then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what your message represented with </v>

10
00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:40.994
<v Speaker 2>something in the culture desperately </v>
<v Speaker 2>needed this sort of what that signifies </v>

11
00:00:44.021 --> 00:00:45.970
<v Speaker 2>to me as a kind of reintegration of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacred.</v>

12
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.003
<v Speaker 2>Did you have any sense back then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the exponential success that you were </v>

13
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.950
<v Speaker 2>going to have between then and now?</v>

14
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.133
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the most likely outcome at each </v>

15
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.130
<v Speaker 3>of the what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would you say at each point where I</v>

16
00:01:03.131 --> 00:01:03.964
<v Speaker 3>might notice what's going on around me </v>
<v Speaker 3>has been that this was stopped but it </v>

17
00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:09.514
<v Speaker 3>isn't stopping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I've been thinking about that pretty </v>

18
00:01:12.311 --> 00:01:14.920
<v Speaker 3>much nonstop I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I have some,</v>

19
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.800
<v Speaker 3>some solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say,</v>

20
00:01:17.801 --> 00:01:20.230
<v Speaker 3>or some ideas that I didn't present in </v>
<v Speaker 3>October,</v>

21
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.770
<v Speaker 3>so one of the things I've realized is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that part of what's pushing</v>

22
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.390
<v Speaker 3>part of what's accounting for this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the popularity of my ideas is actually a</v>

23
00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:37.330
<v Speaker 3>secondary consequence of a technological</v>
<v Speaker 3>revolution.</v>

24
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.780
<v Speaker 3>And I've seen that more clearly since </v>
<v Speaker 3>October,</v>

25
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.363
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>partly because I can see the mainstream </v>

26
00:01:44.291 --> 00:01:45.124
<v Speaker 3>media dying at a faster and faster rate </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the alternative media expanding </v>

27
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:50.643
<v Speaker 3>faster and faster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So television radio and the classic </v>

28
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.363
<v Speaker 3>print media had shared one thing in </v>
<v Speaker 3>common which was a extreme restriction </v>

29
00:02:02.711 --> 00:02:03.544
<v Speaker 3>in bandwidth.</v>

30
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.680
<v Speaker 3>This was especially true of television </v>
<v Speaker 3>because each minute of television,</v>

31
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.903
<v Speaker 3>given the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the necessity to broadcast and the </v>

32
00:02:12.791 --> 00:02:15.850
<v Speaker 3>expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was unbelievably expensive.</v>

33
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.870
<v Speaker 3>And so there just wasn't time to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything on television.</v>

34
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.790
<v Speaker 3>There's no time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you had something important to</v>

35
00:02:24.791 --> 00:02:26.290
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

36
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.780
<v Speaker 3>or even something unimportant for that </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter,</v>

37
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.970
<v Speaker 3>most of the time it had to be compressed</v>
<v Speaker 3>into something approximating 30 seconds,</v>

38
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.640
<v Speaker 3>which wouldn't even be your words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be a journalist.</v>

39
00:02:36.641 --> 00:02:41.641
<v Speaker 3>Common commenting on what you said and </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were really pushing the envelope,</v>

40
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.140
<v Speaker 3>maybe you'd have 25 minutes on a talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>show that was devoted to your ideas,</v>

41
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.423
<v Speaker 3>but then even that would be highly </v>
<v Speaker 3>scripted and so television made people </v>

42
00:02:53.801 --> 00:02:54.634
<v Speaker 3>look stupider than they were even to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>producers of television because of this </v>

43
00:02:58.721 --> 00:02:59.554
<v Speaker 3>narrow.</v>

44
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.253
<v Speaker 3>The the rise of video online and audio </v>
<v Speaker 3>as well has blown the bandwidth </v>

45
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:14.191
<v Speaker 3>limitation out of our mass communication</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it turns out that people are smarter</v>

46
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.913
<v Speaker 3>with longer attention spans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then we thought what happened with me </v>

47
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:22.474
<v Speaker 3>was that for one reason or another I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>an early adopter of that technology and </v>

48
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:28.894
<v Speaker 3>so there's this massive technological </v>
<v Speaker 3>transformation which is a Gutenberg </v>

49
00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:35.830
<v Speaker 3>revolution in the provision of video and</v>
<v Speaker 3>audio.</v>

50
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.640
<v Speaker 3>No barrier to production because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't cost anything.</v>

51
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.030
<v Speaker 3>Anyone can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People can communicate with it.</v>

52
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.450
<v Speaker 3>You can cut up youtube videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can make your documentaries.</v>

53
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 3>The entry point is easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Audio podcasts and that sort of thing,</v>

54
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:53.200
<v Speaker 3>which can be of indefinite length,</v>
<v Speaker 3>allow people to use,</v>

55
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:56.890
<v Speaker 3>found time to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More people can listen.</v>

56
00:03:56.891 --> 00:03:57.724
<v Speaker 3>Then can read like all of these things </v>
<v Speaker 3>add up to a massive technological </v>

57
00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:02.434
<v Speaker 3>revolution and it's that upswell in </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology that's in part has propelled </v>

58
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.510
<v Speaker 3>what I've been doing to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

59
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.490
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the,</v>

60
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:13.630
<v Speaker 3>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

61
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.980
<v Speaker 3>to this mass audience.</v>

62
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.820
<v Speaker 3>And so that's been a relief to figure </v>
<v Speaker 3>that out because it depersonalizes it to</v>

63
00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:20.290
<v Speaker 3>some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

64
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.153
<v Speaker 3>And so I use the metaphor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not been asked about this before </v>

65
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:27.730
<v Speaker 3>of being on a wave surfing on a giant </v>
<v Speaker 3>wave,</v>

66
00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:30.100
<v Speaker 3>but the wave isn't something that I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>

67
00:04:30.101 --> 00:04:32.230
<v Speaker 3>It's part of this technological </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolution.</v>

68
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:33.603
<v Speaker 3>So that's a relief to know that and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>quite convinced that that's the case </v>

69
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.800
<v Speaker 3>because there are other people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>occupying the same space.</v>

70
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.310
<v Speaker 3>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan is a very good example of that</v>

71
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.420
<v Speaker 3>and the various commentators on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on Youtube who've,</v>

72
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.690
<v Speaker 3>who've become increasingly influential </v>
<v Speaker 3>and powerful.</v>

73
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.750
<v Speaker 3>Same thing driven by the technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They happen to be early adopters and so.</v>

74
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.910
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a secondary question </v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

75
00:05:00.911 --> 00:05:01.744
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there anything specific in </v>

76
00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:05.740
<v Speaker 3>relationship to my content,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say?</v>

77
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:06.574
<v Speaker 3>And I would say also that isn't the case</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think what I've been able to do </v>

78
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.520
<v Speaker 3>with reasonable effectiveness is to draw</v>
<v Speaker 3>a conceptual,</v>

79
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.373
<v Speaker 3>a equation equivalence between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning that's necessary to sustain you </v>

80
00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:28.480
<v Speaker 3>in life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>given it's suffering and malevolence and</v>

81
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.090
<v Speaker 3>the necessity to dog responsibility.</v>

82
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.910
<v Speaker 3>And I think there's something new about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

83
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how new.</v>

84
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure I'm not the first person who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>discovered that,</v>

85
00:05:39.521 --> 00:05:43.700
<v Speaker 3>but I think I've done a reasonable job </v>
<v Speaker 3>of pointing out to people that,</v>

86
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.983
<v Speaker 3>that the suffering that's intrinsic to </v>
<v Speaker 3>life in the absence of meaning is not </v>

87
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:51.363
<v Speaker 3>tolerable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

88
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:52.180
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

89
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.013
<v Speaker 3>it destroys and corrupts and that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>proper pathway out of isn't rights or </v>

90
00:05:58.341 --> 00:06:01.820
<v Speaker 3>happiness or entitlement or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or anything that's associated with,</v>

91
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.570
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with individual ease,</v>

92
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.433
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But with the adoption of something </v>

93
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:12.290
<v Speaker 3>approximating maximal responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people get that,</v>

94
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.153
<v Speaker 3>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that hard to understand when </v>

95
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:18.680
<v Speaker 3>it's laid out like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And lots of people,</v>

96
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:22.070
<v Speaker 3>especially young people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially people who are young and also</v>

97
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:24.590
<v Speaker 3>somewhat nihilistic in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>orientation,</v>

98
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.953
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps because of an excess of </v>

99
00:06:27.051 --> 00:06:31.970
<v Speaker 3>intellectual criticism are they grabbed </v>
<v Speaker 3>that immediately.</v>

100
00:06:31.971 --> 00:06:32.661
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

101
00:06:32.661 --> 00:06:34.340
<v Speaker 3>there's the missing piece.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

102
00:06:34.341 --> 00:06:37.550
<v Speaker 3>It's that the antidote to this </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaninglessness,</v>

103
00:06:37.551 --> 00:06:42.050
<v Speaker 3>this void that I'm confronting isn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>hedonism.</v>

104
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.720
<v Speaker 3>It's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not impulsive pleasure.</v>

105
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.270
<v Speaker 3>It's none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's responsibility.</v>

106
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:48.710
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes,</v>

107
00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:51.350
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That everything snaps into place.</v>

108
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:52.483
<v Speaker 3>And so that's been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the most essential part </v>

109
00:06:55.431 --> 00:06:59.360
<v Speaker 3>of the message to the degree that what </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing has an essential message.</v>

110
00:06:59.361 --> 00:07:00.194
<v Speaker 3>That would be it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I do think that's what accounts for </v>

111
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.460
<v Speaker 3>a large part of its impact.</v>

112
00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:10.410
<v Speaker 2>And you mentioned Joe Rogan before you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he are grouped together in this sort</v>

113
00:07:10.411 --> 00:07:12.640
<v Speaker 2>of new constellation of the intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark web.</v>

114
00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.300
<v Speaker 2>What do you see as the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

115
00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:18.280
<v Speaker 2>what do you make of your kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>inclusion in this and what do you see as</v>

116
00:07:18.281 --> 00:07:21.060
<v Speaker 2>its role going forward in the cultural </v>
<v Speaker 2>organization?</v>

117
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

118
00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:22.660
<v Speaker 3>well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

119
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.330
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a herd of cats,</v>

120
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.200
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because so I've thought about,</v>

121
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:29.980
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

122
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:30.813
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what unites us to the degree that </v>

123
00:07:32.951 --> 00:07:35.350
<v Speaker 3>there's an us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's not so self evident.</v>

124
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.640
<v Speaker 3>There's enough of us so that the name he</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it stuck.</v>

125
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.253
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's something in common because </v>

126
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:45.370
<v Speaker 3>otherwise the name wouldn't have stuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

127
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.040
<v Speaker 3>You can't name nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work.</v>

128
00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:52.960
<v Speaker 3>And I've talked to a fair bit about this</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Dave Rubin because Dave Rubin and I</v>

129
00:07:52.961 --> 00:07:55.030
<v Speaker 3>have been touring together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

130
00:07:55.031 --> 00:07:59.680
<v Speaker 3>He opens my mind discussions and adds a </v>
<v Speaker 3>nice comedic touch to them.</v>

131
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:03.340
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what do we have in common?</v>

132
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.020
<v Speaker 3>Everybody in the group is an independent</v>
<v Speaker 3>practitioner.</v>

133
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.153
<v Speaker 3>So an entrepreneur essentially with </v>
<v Speaker 3>their own media enterprise that's </v>

134
00:08:13.991 --> 00:08:17.590
<v Speaker 3>autonomous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None of us are serving any master except</v>

135
00:08:17.591 --> 00:08:19.360
<v Speaker 3>the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

136
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:20.530
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

137
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:25.360
<v Speaker 3>and we're all somewhat independent </v>
<v Speaker 3>financially as a consequence of that.</v>

138
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.480
<v Speaker 3>And so that makes us beholden to no </v>
<v Speaker 3>master.</v>

139
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:33.130
<v Speaker 3>All of us are engaged in these long form</v>
<v Speaker 3>discussions,</v>

140
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.353
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the consequences of being </v>

141
00:08:36.011 --> 00:08:40.510
<v Speaker 3>engaged in long form discussion is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can assume that your intelligence,</v>

142
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:41.463
<v Speaker 3>that your audience is intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's another thing that unites </v>

143
00:08:44.531 --> 00:08:48.460
<v Speaker 3>everybody in the group is we all assume </v>
<v Speaker 3>that our audience is intelligent,</v>

144
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:49.563
<v Speaker 3>but I think that that's not so much a </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence of any particular moral </v>

145
00:08:52.841 --> 00:08:53.674
<v Speaker 3>virtue on our parts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but an observation that the technology </v>

146
00:08:57.241 --> 00:08:58.500
<v Speaker 3>has made possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

147
00:08:58.530 --> 00:08:59.970
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can see this,</v>

148
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.480
<v Speaker 3>I would say particularly with Rogan </v>
<v Speaker 3>because in some sense he's a trailblazer</v>

149
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:04.770
<v Speaker 3>in this domain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

150
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:06.023
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>turns out my audience will listen to a </v>

151
00:09:07.531 --> 00:09:08.364
<v Speaker 3>three hour discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he wouldn't have been able to </v>

152
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:12.120
<v Speaker 3>discover that without the technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

153
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.343
<v Speaker 3>So now to his credit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was smart enough to discover it and </v>

154
00:09:16.951 --> 00:09:19.650
<v Speaker 3>smart enough to notice it when he </v>
<v Speaker 3>discovered it.</v>

155
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:20.721
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

156
00:09:20.721 --> 00:09:23.850
<v Speaker 3>I think that also characterize as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rest of the people in this group,</v>

157
00:09:23.851 --> 00:09:24.421
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

158
00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:25.254
<v Speaker 3>look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the audience actually wants our </v>

159
00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:28.200
<v Speaker 3>listeners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

160
00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:32.670
<v Speaker 3>and viewers want detailed in depth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unscripted,</v>

161
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:33.623
<v Speaker 3>spontaneous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaningful conversation and then really </v>

162
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:41.560
<v Speaker 3>are willing to go in that direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the risk taking element.</v>

163
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:42.070
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

164
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:43.770
<v Speaker 3>I can give you an example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

165
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.460
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just did four talks with Sam Harris,</v>

166
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.250
<v Speaker 3>who's often grouped into this group as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

167
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm on the relationship between science </v>
<v Speaker 3>and religion,</v>

168
00:09:54.721 --> 00:09:56.070
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or facts and values.</v>

169
00:09:56.071 --> 00:09:56.904
<v Speaker 3>That's another way of thinking about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a bit of politics thrown in a </v>

170
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.620
<v Speaker 3>discussion of left rate differences and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so on.</v>

171
00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:05.610
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the willingness to take the risk?</v>

172
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.200
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>

173
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.063
<v Speaker 3>When I met Sam in Vancouver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was where the first two of the </v>

174
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.680
<v Speaker 3>four talks were held.</v>

175
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:17.040
<v Speaker 3>I never met him before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did a podcast together,</v>

176
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:20.880
<v Speaker 3>one of which was very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got locked in the other one,</v>

177
00:10:20.881 --> 00:10:24.750
<v Speaker 3>which was more productive I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I had no idea if he had,</v>

178
00:10:24.751 --> 00:10:26.700
<v Speaker 3>I could talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we,</v>

179
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:31.050
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were willing to willing to.</v>

180
00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:32.723
<v Speaker 3>I guess that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Agreed to take the risk to see if we </v>

181
00:10:36.541 --> 00:10:37.374
<v Speaker 3>could talk in a public forum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's another thing that </v>

182
00:10:41.461 --> 00:10:42.294
<v Speaker 3>characterizes the people in that group </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that they will take those sorts of </v>

183
00:10:45.001 --> 00:10:47.790
<v Speaker 3>risks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go into a television studio,</v>

184
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.983
<v Speaker 3>a classic television studio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the conversation is scripted and </v>

185
00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.313
<v Speaker 3>it's actually quite frustrated because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't have a conversation with the </v>

186
00:10:55.711 --> 00:10:58.110
<v Speaker 3>journalist because the journalist isn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

187
00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:59.453
<v Speaker 3>who's there is a frontest piece for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>organization and the organization has </v>

188
00:11:04.251 --> 00:11:08.550
<v Speaker 3>scripted all their responses and so it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>not actually like talking to a person.</v>

189
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:13.380
<v Speaker 3>It's really like talking to a puppet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for better or for worse,</v>

190
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.610
<v Speaker 3>but in these low unscripted loan form </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations,</v>

191
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.473
<v Speaker 3>then you can take the risk of having a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation and that can go </v>

192
00:11:22.861 --> 00:11:25.620
<v Speaker 3>spectacularly well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it can also fail dismally.</v>

193
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:26.873
<v Speaker 3>So I would say those are the things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>united us to the degree that the group </v>

194
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.943
<v Speaker 3>exists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've met who I was in la a week </v>

195
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:38.910
<v Speaker 3>ago and about seven of us got together </v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

196
00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:40.403
<v Speaker 3>for dinner</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was the first time we met as </v>

197
00:11:44.581 --> 00:11:48.330
<v Speaker 3>anything approximating a group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

198
00:11:48.331 --> 00:11:51.030
<v Speaker 3>it was interesting to watch everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>interact because as I said,</v>

199
00:11:51.031 --> 00:11:51.864
<v Speaker 3>it really is a herd of cats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's tremendous diversity of </v>

200
00:11:53.981 --> 00:11:57.490
<v Speaker 3>political opinion and a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 3>diversity of personality.</v>

201
00:11:57.491 --> 00:11:58.324
<v Speaker 3>Like Eric Weinstein and Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they're not even members of the </v>

202
00:12:02.261 --> 00:12:04.450
<v Speaker 3>same species in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

203
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.890
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it,</v>

204
00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:11.920
<v Speaker 3>it's a very fractious group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think those things that I outlined</v>

205
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.120
<v Speaker 3>are the elements that basically united,</v>

206
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:20.650
<v Speaker 2>there's also something that I sent to </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching some of the discussions.</v>

207
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:25.810
<v Speaker 2>There's a kind of intellectual curiosity</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a sense of people thinking in public</v>

208
00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:27.903
<v Speaker 2>and there's also a sense of maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential for people to change their </v>

209
00:12:30.911 --> 00:12:32.020
<v Speaker 2>minds or to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

210
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:33.640
<v Speaker 2>to discover things during the course.</v>

211
00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:37.650
<v Speaker 3>Was that partly the appreciation of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence of the audience?</v>

212
00:12:37.651 --> 00:12:38.484
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I would say it is actually the </v>

213
00:12:40.501 --> 00:12:41.334
<v Speaker 3>manifestation of the process of thinking</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's more important than the </v>

214
00:12:45.151 --> 00:12:45.984
<v Speaker 3>conclusions that are generated even in </v>
<v Speaker 3>these discussions that I've been having </v>

215
00:12:48.871 --> 00:12:51.480
<v Speaker 3>with Harris.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we are trying to,</v>

216
00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:53.783
<v Speaker 3>to argue out to different viewpoints </v>
<v Speaker 3>because Harris believes that values can </v>

217
00:12:57.901 --> 00:12:59.910
<v Speaker 3>be derived with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

218
00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:05.070
<v Speaker 3>with unerring precision in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>using the proper methodology from facts.</v>

219
00:13:05.071 --> 00:13:05.904
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that it's more complicated </v>

220
00:13:08.221 --> 00:13:09.054
<v Speaker 3>than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there has to be intermediate </v>

221
00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:13.650
<v Speaker 3>structures and those are really </v>
<v Speaker 3>narrative and in their nature.</v>

222
00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:17.160
<v Speaker 3>So there's a technical argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

223
00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.173
<v Speaker 3>as well as a variety of sub arguments </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the relative role of traditional </v>

224
00:13:21.391 --> 00:13:22.224
<v Speaker 3>religion and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the outcome of the debate about </v>

225
00:13:26.371 --> 00:13:31.200
<v Speaker 3>those issues is partly what people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming to the talks to see,</v>

226
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:35.010
<v Speaker 3>to determine what should the conclusions</v>
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>

227
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.113
<v Speaker 3>but a much larger part perhaps is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>observe and engage at least by proxy in </v>

228
00:13:42.091 --> 00:13:42.924
<v Speaker 3>the process of dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's more important because </v>

229
00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.860
<v Speaker 3>dialogue is the process by which complex</v>
<v Speaker 3>problems are solved.</v>

230
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.173
<v Speaker 3>Which is what makes me a free speech </v>
<v Speaker 3>advocate fundamentally was not an </v>

231
00:13:54.001 --> 00:13:57.480
<v Speaker 3>advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I realized that that,</v>

232
00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:58.793
<v Speaker 3>that protection for free speech is </v>
<v Speaker 3>protection of the mechanism whereby </v>

233
00:14:02.161 --> 00:14:05.820
<v Speaker 3>complex social problems are solved and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

234
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:11.120
<v Speaker 3>we're the people in this group and many </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people as well are acting out that</v>

235
00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:14.110
<v Speaker 3>dialogical process and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

236
00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.680
<v Speaker 3>and people are happy about that as they </v>
<v Speaker 3>should be.</v>

237
00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:22.270
<v Speaker 2>And I've read the spectator review of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your recent conversation.</v>

238
00:14:22.641 --> 00:14:23.474
<v Speaker 2>I think you've now come to the end of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your debates with Sam Harris and they </v>

239
00:14:26.151 --> 00:14:30.320
<v Speaker 2>said that you expressed a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>irritation at some of the stuff when Sam</v>

240
00:14:30.321 --> 00:14:32.540
<v Speaker 2>didn't grasp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of the points that you're making or</v>

241
00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:35.330
<v Speaker 2>that you didn't fully appreciate that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>read and understood them.</v>

242
00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.300
<v Speaker 2>I also think that Sam Harris in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular,</v>

243
00:14:38.301 --> 00:14:40.610
<v Speaker 2>like he's built a whole kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality career,</v>

244
00:14:40.611 --> 00:14:41.444
<v Speaker 2>several books on this atheism position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that he can argue in good </v>

245
00:14:46.281 --> 00:14:49.790
<v Speaker 2>faith from that perspective?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could he turn round and say,</v>

246
00:14:49.791 --> 00:14:50.511
<v Speaker 2>well actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

247
00:14:50.511 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This atheism</v>

248
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:53.950
<v Speaker 3>thing is a bit simplistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

249
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.720
<v Speaker 3>I think he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he was conducting the discussion</v>

250
00:14:56.721 --> 00:14:57.554
<v Speaker 3>in good faith.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually think that what Sam is doing </v>

251
00:14:59.721 --> 00:15:02.030
<v Speaker 3>is a good faith project.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

252
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.073
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's conceptual muddiness </v>

253
00:15:05.391 --> 00:15:07.030
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

254
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:09.080
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

255
00:15:09.081 --> 00:15:09.914
<v Speaker 3>his basic premise is that we could come </v>
<v Speaker 3>to an agreement that working to reduce </v>

256
00:15:15.621 --> 00:15:20.621
<v Speaker 3>unnecessary misery and suffering is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>universal good slim.</v>

257
00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:22.820
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fair enough.</v>

258
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:25.040
<v Speaker 3>That seems like a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 3>proposition.</v>

259
00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's a proposition of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact.</v>

260
00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.990
<v Speaker 3>And he claims that it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't matter still.</v>

261
00:15:29.991 --> 00:15:31.280
<v Speaker 3>It's fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

262
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.020
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

263
00:15:33.021 --> 00:15:33.854
<v Speaker 3>so that's one proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other proposition is it would be </v>

264
00:15:36.441 --> 00:15:41.150
<v Speaker 3>really good if our systems of value </v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't founded on air.</v>

265
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.690
<v Speaker 3>And what do we have that's not air?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we have facts,</v>

266
00:15:44.691 --> 00:15:46.340
<v Speaker 3>we have objective facts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

267
00:15:46.341 --> 00:15:47.174
<v Speaker 3>look at the technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at what we've done with our </v>

268
00:15:48.591 --> 00:15:49.250
<v Speaker 3>science.</v>

269
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:50.083
<v Speaker 3>It's like you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>underestimate the utility of objective </v>

270
00:15:52.281 --> 00:15:53.114
<v Speaker 3>facts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so maybe we can ground the value </v>

271
00:15:54.081 --> 00:15:55.520
<v Speaker 3>structure in the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

272
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:56.683
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be good if we could do it so </v>

273
00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:00.770
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so.</v>

274
00:16:00.771 --> 00:16:02.180
<v Speaker 3>And then his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his ethic,</v>

275
00:16:02.181 --> 00:16:04.700
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as an amalgam of those two propositions.</v>

276
00:16:04.701 --> 00:16:07.320
<v Speaker 3>And I think that his project is </v>
<v Speaker 3>honorable and,</v>

277
00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:08.373
<v Speaker 3>and I think he's committed to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He also rightly is concerned with the </v>

278
00:16:12.681 --> 00:16:17.270
<v Speaker 3>dangers of the fundamentalist dangers of</v>
<v Speaker 3>revealed truth.</v>

279
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:20.690
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it's very skeptical about,</v>

280
00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:25.670
<v Speaker 3>about the axiomatic claims of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of dogmatic religion.</v>

281
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:28.280
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

282
00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.040
<v Speaker 3>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

283
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:34.543
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mechanisms that he outlines to </v>

284
00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:41.150
<v Speaker 3>derive values from facts are </v>
<v Speaker 3>insufficient in my estimation.</v>

285
00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:45.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that his argument is </v>
<v Speaker 3>sufficiently sophisticated,</v>

286
00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:46.753
<v Speaker 3>even though I don't doubt it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that Sam is any less </v>

287
00:16:50.331 --> 00:16:55.331
<v Speaker 3>committed to an ethical good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not obvious to me that he is than I</v>

288
00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:57.110
<v Speaker 3>am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

289
00:16:57.111 --> 00:16:57.944
<v Speaker 3>and he's argued and discussed</v>
<v Speaker 3>fully in good faith as far as I'm </v>

290
00:17:03.351 --> 00:17:04.250
<v Speaker 3>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

291
00:17:04.251 --> 00:17:05.084
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the odd error because no one is </v>

292
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:11.990
<v Speaker 3>negotiating 100 percent all the time in </v>
<v Speaker 3>good faith.</v>

293
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:14.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's a standard that no one </v>
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>

294
00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.920
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can achieve,</v>

295
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:19.320
<v Speaker 3>but I think the discussions have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably productive and,</v>

296
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:22.080
<v Speaker 3>and we'll see that certainly the crowds </v>
<v Speaker 3>are respond.</v>

297
00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:25.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the crowds would have been</v>
<v Speaker 3>engaged if Sam wouldn't have been,</v>

298
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.590
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't have been discussing in good </v>
<v Speaker 3>faith,</v>

299
00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.053
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the engagement is actually an </v>

300
00:17:31.101 --> 00:17:33.530
<v Speaker 3>indication that a good faith discussion </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

301
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.630
<v Speaker 3>is occurring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise it gets dealt very,</v>

302
00:17:35.631 --> 00:17:36.464
<v Speaker 3>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll see what happens when the videos </v>

303
00:17:38.721 --> 00:17:39.554
<v Speaker 3>are released and that'll be in August.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once their sound is edited and all of </v>

304
00:17:43.671 --> 00:17:44.504
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then people will have a public </v>

305
00:17:46.911 --> 00:17:51.060
<v Speaker 3>debate about how it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did discussion proceeded.</v>

306
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.043
<v Speaker 3>I also think that each discussion built </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the previous one and that we both </v>

307
00:17:56.011 --> 00:17:56.844
<v Speaker 3>ended up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we both ended up more informed </v>

308
00:17:58.891 --> 00:18:02.550
<v Speaker 3>and more articulate than we started out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a good.</v>

309
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:03.413
<v Speaker 3>That's a really good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I certainly understand his argument is </v>

310
00:18:05.341 --> 00:18:09.420
<v Speaker 3>much better than I did well a year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

311
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:14.360
<v Speaker 2>and I've heard Eric Weinstein described </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of the cultural moment is a kind of</v>

312
00:18:14.361 --> 00:18:15.194
<v Speaker 2>civil war within the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of extreme left and then sort of </v>

313
00:18:18.111 --> 00:18:19.950
<v Speaker 2>moderate soft left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

314
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:20.251
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

315
00:18:20.251 --> 00:18:23.600
<v Speaker 2>probably sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least the dominating kind of paradigm</v>

316
00:18:23.601 --> 00:18:25.590
<v Speaker 2>in the media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

317
00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:26.703
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

318
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:27.643
<v Speaker 2>I've got a lot of progressive friends </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what I see happening recently maybe </v>

319
00:18:30.891 --> 00:18:31.724
<v Speaker 2>in the last couple of weeks is a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them starting to grapple with your </v>

320
00:18:35.481 --> 00:18:37.230
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

321
00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:38.173
<v Speaker 2>and looking at asking this question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can the left learn from Jordan </v>

322
00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:43.230
<v Speaker 2>Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

323
00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:44.083
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a pretty new development </v>

324
00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.370
<v Speaker 2>because I saw a lot of kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reactivity to it before.</v>

325
00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:53.480
<v Speaker 2>How can you personally contribute to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that debate?</v>

326
00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:54.520
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

327
00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.430
<v Speaker 3>is that a debate you're interested in </v>
<v Speaker 3>contributing?</v>

328
00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:58.250
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

329
00:18:58.251 --> 00:19:00.500
<v Speaker 3>no doubt about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no doubt about it.</v>

330
00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.793
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing that I've been doing in my </v>

331
00:19:04.041 --> 00:19:08.810
<v Speaker 3>tour repeatedly when I talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first chapter of my book,</v>

332
00:19:08.811 --> 00:19:10.910
<v Speaker 3>which is stand up straight with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoulders back,</v>

333
00:19:10.911 --> 00:19:14.060
<v Speaker 3>it's a discussion of hierarchies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>their eternal nature,</v>

334
00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:15.200
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because my claim,</v>

335
00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:16.243
<v Speaker 3>not my claim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's mirror fact that organisms </v>

336
00:19:20.991 --> 00:19:21.824
<v Speaker 3>that have to cooperate and compete with </v>
<v Speaker 3>other organisms have their type </v>

337
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.600
<v Speaker 3>inevitably arrange themselves into </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies.</v>

338
00:19:29.601 --> 00:19:34.601
<v Speaker 3>And that's been going on for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is at least 300 million years that</v>

339
00:19:35.361 --> 00:19:36.194
<v Speaker 3>our nervous systems have adapted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies as if they're a permanent </v>

340
00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:40.573
<v Speaker 3>element of being right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more permanent than treats like </v>

341
00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:49.370
<v Speaker 3>seriously permanent at the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamental neurochemical,</v>

342
00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.233
<v Speaker 3>the one that regulates the entire brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Serotonin is acutely sensitive to </v>

343
00:19:54.021 --> 00:19:57.410
<v Speaker 3>hierarchical distinctions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's part of the proposition.</v>

344
00:19:57.410 --> 00:19:58.243
<v Speaker 3>So the reason I laid that proposition </v>
<v Speaker 3>forward was to say whatever pitfalls </v>

345
00:20:03.471 --> 00:20:04.304
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies might produce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you cannot lay them at the feet of the </v>

346
00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.200
<v Speaker 3>West Patriarchy or capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's a nonstarter.</v>

347
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:15.200
<v Speaker 3>You're wrong and not just a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>

348
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:18.560
<v Speaker 3>You're so seriously wrong that if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>insist upon doing that,</v>

349
00:20:18.561 --> 00:20:19.394
<v Speaker 3>you won't even achieve your own names </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're actually not grappling </v>

350
00:20:22.941 --> 00:20:23.774
<v Speaker 3>with the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is if hierarchies are a </v>

351
00:20:25.881 --> 00:20:27.710
<v Speaker 3>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which they are,</v>

352
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:32.000
<v Speaker 3>the problem is way more serious than </v>
<v Speaker 3>mere capitalism.</v>

353
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:37.750
<v Speaker 3>It's way deeper and if you're actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in rectifying the cons,</v>

354
00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.490
<v Speaker 3>the negative consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies,</v>

355
00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.300
<v Speaker 3>then you're going to have to get a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>more sophisticated than your,</v>

356
00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:46.370
<v Speaker 3>than your idiot Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

357
00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:47.293
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so part of the elaboration of that </v>

358
00:20:48.971 --> 00:20:49.930
<v Speaker 3>argument is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

359
00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.513
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies are inevitable because we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to solve complex problems and we </v>

360
00:20:54.641 --> 00:20:55.990
<v Speaker 3>have to solve them socially.</v>

361
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.020
<v Speaker 3>And when you implement a solution to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>complex problem,</v>

362
00:20:59.021 --> 00:20:59.854
<v Speaker 3>socially you produce a hierarchy because</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people are better at the </v>

363
00:21:02.501 --> 00:21:06.010
<v Speaker 3>implementation than others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a hierarchy of competence and</v>

364
00:21:06.011 --> 00:21:09.400
<v Speaker 3>then there's a hierarchy of distribution</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the spoils.</v>

365
00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:12.130
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in both of those hierarchies,</v>

366
00:21:12.131 --> 00:21:12.964
<v Speaker 3>you get a disproportionate clumping of </v>
<v Speaker 3>resources at the top and disposition at </v>

367
00:21:16.961 --> 00:21:19.300
<v Speaker 3>the bottom and the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies.</v>

368
00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:20.493
<v Speaker 3>So what's the left for?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The left is to remind those who are </v>

369
00:21:25.151 --> 00:21:25.984
<v Speaker 3>benefiting from the hierarchies that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy comes at a cost and the cost </v>

370
00:21:31.691 --> 00:21:32.524
<v Speaker 3>is the clumping of people at the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that that's an internal costs and </v>

371
00:21:36.851 --> 00:21:37.684
<v Speaker 3>it's not trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that's what the left should be </v>

372
00:21:40.511 --> 00:21:41.344
<v Speaker 3>properly focused on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The left should be providing the voice </v>

373
00:21:44.321 --> 00:21:45.154
<v Speaker 3>of those who are dispossessed by </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies and the right should be </v>

374
00:21:47.801 --> 00:21:49.090
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

375
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:54.670
<v Speaker 3>but the damn hierarchies are necessary </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're not only necessary,</v>

376
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.590
<v Speaker 3>but they're also productive.</v>

377
00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:58.323
<v Speaker 3>Then the left says yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they tilt towards tyranny and they </v>

378
00:22:02.201 --> 00:22:06.400
<v Speaker 3>can be occupied inappropriately by </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are playing games of power.</v>

379
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:09.370
<v Speaker 3>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The right has to take that into account.</v>

380
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.980
<v Speaker 3>The hierarchy can rigidity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rigidified,</v>

381
00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:16.420
<v Speaker 3>and is likely to do that and it can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>taken over by people who are corrupt and</v>

382
00:22:16.421 --> 00:22:18.610
<v Speaker 3>that's likely to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

383
00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:21.250
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's okay because the dialogue could</v>

384
00:22:21.251 --> 00:22:23.200
<v Speaker 3>work out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The right can say,</v>

385
00:22:23.201 --> 00:22:24.034
<v Speaker 3>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need the damn hierarchies and they </v>

386
00:22:24.971 --> 00:22:27.790
<v Speaker 3>need to be about trust.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the left can say yes,</v>

387
00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:28.683
<v Speaker 3>but they have to be maintained properly </v>
<v Speaker 3>so they don't deteriorate and </v>

388
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:35.020
<v Speaker 3>degenerate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's,</v>

389
00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:35.913
<v Speaker 3>I think that's ancient wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the ancient Egyptians had </v>

390
00:22:38.111 --> 00:22:40.660
<v Speaker 3>figured that out in their symbolic </v>
<v Speaker 3>representations.</v>

391
00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:46.080
<v Speaker 3>So now when the left goes too far,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does something like say,</v>

392
00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:48.000
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how about no hierarchies?</v>

393
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:48.611
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

394
00:22:48.611 --> 00:22:53.611
<v Speaker 3>how about not wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because all that happens if you flat.</v>

395
00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:54.693
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that happens if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>flatten out the hierarchy is that you </v>

396
00:22:56.921 --> 00:22:57.754
<v Speaker 3>can't even organize your perceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't perceive the world without </v>

397
00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:03.790
<v Speaker 3>looking at the world through a hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 3>of value.</v>

398
00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:05.103
<v Speaker 3>And if because you can't perceive the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world unless you make one thing more </v>

399
00:23:08.201 --> 00:23:10.840
<v Speaker 3>important than all the other things </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you don't even know what to look</v>

400
00:23:10.841 --> 00:23:11.674
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if one thing isn't more important </v>

401
00:23:13.181 --> 00:23:15.250
<v Speaker 3>than all the other things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you have nothing to aim at.</v>

402
00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:18.040
<v Speaker 3>If you have nothing to aim at and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have no meaning in your life,</v>

403
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:22.930
<v Speaker 3>so the left can't just demolish the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies in the name of some equality</v>

404
00:23:22.931 --> 00:23:23.920
<v Speaker 3>of outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

405
00:23:23.921 --> 00:23:27.460
<v Speaker 3>because you blow out the future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you leave people aimless,</v>

406
00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:28.383
<v Speaker 3>and you destroyed the very institutions </v>
<v Speaker 3>that allow people to make competent </v>

407
00:23:31.241 --> 00:23:32.410
<v Speaker 3>progress in the world.</v>

408
00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:35.920
<v Speaker 3>That's not an acceptable outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we have to,</v>

409
00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:37.203
<v Speaker 3>we have to agree to live with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tension necessity for hierarchies that </v>

410
00:23:43.051 --> 00:23:43.884
<v Speaker 3>proclivity for them to pathologize and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the necessary voice of the left and </v>

411
00:23:48.261 --> 00:23:50.630
<v Speaker 3>speaking for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the dispossessed.</v>

412
00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:54.320
<v Speaker 3>So and I mean I've.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As far as I'm concerned,</v>

413
00:23:54.321 --> 00:23:58.550
<v Speaker 3>I've said something approximating that </v>
<v Speaker 3>through my entire career.</v>

414
00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:03.380
<v Speaker 3>So the fact that the left wingers have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been irritated at me as well,</v>

415
00:24:03.381 --> 00:24:04.214
<v Speaker 3>in some sense that's an inevitable </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence of me taking on the radical </v>

416
00:24:08.751 --> 00:24:09.584
<v Speaker 3>left wingers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also the refusal by the </v>

417
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.480
<v Speaker 3>moderate left to deal with their </v>
<v Speaker 3>internal problems</v>

418
00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:22.850
<v Speaker 2>and the sticking point that I hear a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>from my sort of more progressive friends</v>

419
00:24:22.851 --> 00:24:25.610
<v Speaker 2>is your sort of primary focus is on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual.</v>

420
00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:26.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's,</v>

421
00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.313
<v Speaker 3>that's too bad for them because their </v>
<v Speaker 3>primary focus should be on the </v>

422
00:24:29.381 --> 00:24:29.900
<v Speaker 3>individual.</v>

423
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.190
<v Speaker 2>I can agree with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I.</v>

424
00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:35.300
<v Speaker 2>The paradox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would say it's like,</v>

425
00:24:35.301 --> 00:24:37.340
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>focus on the individual,</v>

426
00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:38.443
<v Speaker 2>but you have to accept that there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>some situations that are much more </v>

427
00:24:41.661 --> 00:24:42.494
<v Speaker 2>conducive to an individual thriving and </v>
<v Speaker 2>other situations and so they're focused </v>

428
00:24:45.531 --> 00:24:48.440
<v Speaker 2>on structural inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your focusing on the individual,</v>

429
00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.750
<v Speaker 2>is there not some interplay?</v>

430
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:51.763
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously because people do have group </v>

431
00:24:53.321 --> 00:24:54.154
<v Speaker 3>identities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The question is whether whether the </v>

432
00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:00.810
<v Speaker 3>group or the individual identity should </v>
<v Speaker 3>be paramount and the leftist dance.</v>

433
00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:02.760
<v Speaker 3>The radical leftist answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

434
00:25:02.761 --> 00:25:03.594
<v Speaker 3>there is the look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not me that's failing to take into </v>

435
00:25:07.061 --> 00:25:07.894
<v Speaker 3>account those two levels of analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the bloody radical leftist because </v>

436
00:25:10.511 --> 00:25:11.344
<v Speaker 3>for them it's the collective and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and so it's obvious as far as I'm </v>

437
00:25:16.661 --> 00:25:17.494
<v Speaker 3>concerned that people have their </v>
<v Speaker 3>individuality and then behind that they </v>

438
00:25:20.831 --> 00:25:22.420
<v Speaker 3>have there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have their group,</v>

439
00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:25.450
<v Speaker 3>multiple group identities which is also </v>
<v Speaker 3>a big problem</v>

440
00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.633
<v Speaker 2>or any of these situations that make it </v>
<v Speaker 2>much more difficult for people to self </v>

441
00:25:29.801 --> 00:25:32.290
<v Speaker 2>actualize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What what I think they'd argue with.</v>

442
00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.390
<v Speaker 2>They don't hear you talk about that very</v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

443
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:35.290
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it isn't.</v>

444
00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:37.720
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not self evident like I'm not.</v>

445
00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:39.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't accept maslow's hierarchy of </v>
<v Speaker 3>needs.</v>

446
00:25:39.941 --> 00:25:40.774
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's necessarily more </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult for people who are poor to </v>

447
00:25:43.481 --> 00:25:45.010
<v Speaker 3>self actualize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

448
00:25:45.011 --> 00:25:47.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy that because what that would</v>
<v Speaker 3>mean.</v>

449
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:48.663
<v Speaker 3>Think about what that would mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would mean that the rich are </v>

450
00:25:51.101 --> 00:25:54.220
<v Speaker 3>morally superior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what that means,</v>

451
00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:56.950
<v Speaker 3>because they have all the opportunities </v>
<v Speaker 3>to self actualize.</v>

452
00:25:56.951 --> 00:25:57.784
<v Speaker 3>So obviously if the material conditions </v>
<v Speaker 3>are the prerequisite for self </v>

453
00:26:00.791 --> 00:26:01.624
<v Speaker 3>actualization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the rich are morally superior to </v>

454
00:26:03.431 --> 00:26:04.264
<v Speaker 3>the poor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that really an argument we want to </v>

455
00:26:05.471 --> 00:26:07.540
<v Speaker 3>make?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then in fact,</v>

456
00:26:07.541 --> 00:26:08.374
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that that's even even </v>
<v Speaker 3>vaguely reasonable because one of the </v>

457
00:26:11.591 --> 00:26:14.980
<v Speaker 3>things that does help build character is</v>
<v Speaker 3>privation.</v>

458
00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:20.790
<v Speaker 3>Now obviously starving to death is an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an excess of privation.</v>

459
00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:24.460
<v Speaker 3>So there are limit conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

460
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.823
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a leftist trope that the provision </v>

461
00:26:28.631 --> 00:26:32.800
<v Speaker 3>of additional material resources will </v>
<v Speaker 3>produce ethically superior human beings.</v>

462
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.840
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not true.</v>

463
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.180
<v Speaker 3>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes quite the contrary.</v>

464
00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:38.920
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

465
00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:40.180
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't,</v>

466
00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy that argument in the least.</v>

467
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:44.093
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also think that under most </v>

468
00:26:46.141 --> 00:26:46.974
<v Speaker 3>circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it accepting those of exceptional </v>

469
00:26:49.471 --> 00:26:53.700
<v Speaker 3>privation and even perhaps under those </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditions in most,</v>

470
00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.073
<v Speaker 3>in most cases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your best bet to move people forward is </v>

471
00:26:59.371 --> 00:27:00.204
<v Speaker 3>to concentrate on the development of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their individual character and their </v>

472
00:27:03.151 --> 00:27:05.340
<v Speaker 3>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their individual moral character.</v>

473
00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:10.260
<v Speaker 3>And because moral character is actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>your moral character is actually the set</v>

474
00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:11.094
<v Speaker 3>of tools that you have to operate </v>
<v Speaker 3>effectively in the work because </v>

475
00:27:13.681 --> 00:27:15.990
<v Speaker 3>otherwise morality would be of no </v>
<v Speaker 3>utility.</v>

476
00:27:15.991 --> 00:27:20.991
<v Speaker 3>And morality is in some sense precisely </v>
<v Speaker 3>that w which is of maximal utility.</v>

477
00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:23.573
<v Speaker 3>And so and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the other objection that I would </v>

478
00:27:25.531 --> 00:27:27.480
<v Speaker 3>throw it at the radical leftists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

479
00:27:27.481 --> 00:27:29.160
<v Speaker 3>how do you know that your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

480
00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:30.053
<v Speaker 3>your emphasis on collective existence </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't just an abdication of your </v>

481
00:27:35.671 --> 00:27:37.050
<v Speaker 3>personal responsibility.</v>

482
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.190
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course it's not.</v>

483
00:27:38.191 --> 00:27:39.120
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

484
00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:39.810
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

485
00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:41.370
<v Speaker 3>Seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

486
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.430
<v Speaker 3>it's not that easy to adopt personal </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility,</v>

487
00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:46.043
<v Speaker 3>maximal personal responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What makes you think you're not running </v>

488
00:27:49.801 --> 00:27:52.350
<v Speaker 3>away from it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have every reason to.</v>

489
00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:56.160
<v Speaker 3>You really have that stellar moral </v>
<v Speaker 3>character.</v>

490
00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:57.320
<v Speaker 3>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

491
00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.850
<v Speaker 3>that's yourself analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

492
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:00.833
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I especially don't buy it when I </v>

493
00:28:02.401 --> 00:28:03.234
<v Speaker 3>look at the consequences of leftist </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolution because all of these people </v>

494
00:28:06.901 --> 00:28:11.820
<v Speaker 3>have stellar moral character when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>undertake their collectivist revolution.</v>

495
00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:15.330
<v Speaker 3>Nothing comes out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but absolute bloody catastrophe.</v>

496
00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:20.610
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so all the well meaning aims aside,</v>

497
00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:22.403
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my sense of a lot of the progressive </v>

498
00:28:25.231 --> 00:28:26.064
<v Speaker 2>people that I know is that they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're sort of from a new </v>

499
00:28:28.891 --> 00:28:30.780
<v Speaker 2>generation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not generally materialists,</v>

500
00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:31.643
<v Speaker 2>that they're sort of very spiritually </v>
<v Speaker 2>aware and I sense a kind of implicit </v>

501
00:28:35.281 --> 00:28:37.260
<v Speaker 2>message in what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard,</v>

502
00:28:37.261 --> 00:28:42.261
<v Speaker 2>made explicitly that in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>materialism is a deadening doctrine.</v>

503
00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:44.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean you look at the opiod crisis in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>

504
00:28:44.851 --> 00:28:46.330
<v Speaker 2>you look at a lot of these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

505
00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:47.253
<v Speaker 2>if poverty is seen as a more sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>also also as a sort of spiritual crisis </v>

506
00:28:50.581 --> 00:28:53.250
<v Speaker 2>or a crisis of the soul as much as </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything else.</v>

507
00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:55.403
<v Speaker 3>Is it mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be lovely if poverty was </v>

508
00:28:59.161 --> 00:29:00.450
<v Speaker 3>caused by lack of money.</v>

509
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:03.020
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could fix it really easily then.</v>

510
00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:08.120
<v Speaker 2>But my point I think is to say that if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you frame your message in that way,</v>

511
00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:09.013
<v Speaker 2>I think there will be a lot of people on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the left who would be receptive to that </v>

512
00:29:11.691 --> 00:29:12.524
<v Speaker 2>message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sort of the that actually there is a </v>

513
00:29:14.211 --> 00:29:18.140
<v Speaker 2>crisis of the crisis of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you call it,</v>

514
00:29:18.141 --> 00:29:18.974
<v Speaker 2>like worldview has real consequences and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of poverty we're seeing in the </v>

515
00:29:22.251 --> 00:29:25.220
<v Speaker 2>world is to do with this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>materialist worldview that has become,</v>

516
00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:30.440
<v Speaker 2>become corrupt or at least kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stripped all of the meaning and purpose.</v>

517
00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that,</v>

518
00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.590
<v Speaker 3>that's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

519
00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:33.453
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

520
00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:34.353
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't believe that materialism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>materialist hedonism is a sufficient </v>

521
00:29:39.611 --> 00:29:40.444
<v Speaker 3>solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's bit more complicated than that </v>

522
00:29:42.611 --> 00:29:43.444
<v Speaker 3>because I do think that functional </v>
<v Speaker 3>democratic systems are actually pretty </v>

523
00:29:48.671 --> 00:29:49.504
<v Speaker 3>good at reasonable hedonism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm pretty happy that our system </v>

524
00:29:54.161 --> 00:29:59.050
<v Speaker 3>produces a variety of toothpastes and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>variety of toilet papers in a variety of</v>

525
00:29:59.051 --> 00:30:01.410
<v Speaker 3>sanitary napkins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of these things that,</v>

526
00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:06.640
<v Speaker 3>that are basically oriented towards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you call them individually,</v>

527
00:30:06.641 --> 00:30:07.474
<v Speaker 3>creature comforts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something about that that's </v>

528
00:30:08.951 --> 00:30:12.490
<v Speaker 3>really merciful and properly </v>
<v Speaker 3>egalitarian.</v>

529
00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:16.960
<v Speaker 3>And so a certain degree of material </v>
<v Speaker 3>hedonism is a good thing,</v>

530
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:18.000
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it,</v>

531
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:23.190
<v Speaker 3>it's nice that people can have their </v>
<v Speaker 3>basic needs taken care of in a dignified</v>

532
00:30:24.761 --> 00:30:26.040
<v Speaker 3>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

533
00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:27.003
<v Speaker 3>but as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a ultimate solution to the problems </v>

534
00:30:29.501 --> 00:30:30.610
<v Speaker 3>of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's insufficient,</v>

535
00:30:30.611 --> 00:30:33.460
<v Speaker 3>which is again why I don't really like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Abraham maslow's hierarchy of,</v>

536
00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:34.750
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

537
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:36.220
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of needs.</v>

538
00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:37.623
<v Speaker 3>Now it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It isn't a progression up the moral </v>

539
00:30:40.031 --> 00:30:43.420
<v Speaker 3>chain because of the provision of </v>
<v Speaker 3>additional material resources.</v>

540
00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.273
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean that you don't want </v>

541
00:30:46.291 --> 00:30:47.124
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to set up a situation where as </v>

542
00:30:48.341 --> 00:30:53.341
<v Speaker 3>many people as possible are absent the </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible strictures of of privation,</v>

543
00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:59.020
<v Speaker 3>but we are doing that quite rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank God so,</v>

544
00:30:59.080 --> 00:30:59.913
<v Speaker 3>so I think we're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The leftists are less happy with what </v>

545
00:31:05.741 --> 00:31:06.574
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing is the case that I'm making </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the meaning that transcends mere </v>

546
00:31:11.621 --> 00:31:12.454
<v Speaker 3>materialism is to be found in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>adoption of individual responsibility </v>

547
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:18.760
<v Speaker 3>because I wouldn't say that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>core message.</v>

548
00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:19.623
<v Speaker 3>Certainly none of the radical left it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that at all because generally </v>

549
00:31:23.171 --> 00:31:24.004
<v Speaker 3>they construe the individual as either </v>
<v Speaker 3>the oppressor or the suffering or </v>

550
00:31:28.521 --> 00:31:33.521
<v Speaker 3>pressed but not as the active agent as </v>
<v Speaker 3>either of those active agents.</v>

551
00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:34.653
<v Speaker 3>The problem with the oppressor of press </v>
<v Speaker 3>narrative is even though there's an </v>

552
00:31:38.171 --> 00:31:39.004
<v Speaker 3>element of truth to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>each of us can be subdivided into so </v>

553
00:31:42.011 --> 00:31:42.844
<v Speaker 3>many group identities that there's at </v>
<v Speaker 3>least one dimension along which we're </v>

554
00:31:45.821 --> 00:31:46.654
<v Speaker 3>all oppresses and that's actually when </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been looking at what happened in </v>

555
00:31:50.921 --> 00:31:52.750
<v Speaker 3>the aftermath of the Russian revolution.</v>

556
00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:57.130
<v Speaker 3>That that was the bloody error,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>

557
00:31:57.370 --> 00:32:02.370
<v Speaker 3>Because you could take virtually every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any individual and you could find out.</v>

558
00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:04.103
<v Speaker 3>It's like if there's one dimension of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your identity that makes you an </v>

559
00:32:06.761 --> 00:32:07.594
<v Speaker 3>oppressor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that trumps all the elements of your </v>

560
00:32:09.821 --> 00:32:11.440
<v Speaker 3>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you're a victim.</v>

561
00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:13.113
<v Speaker 3>And the problem with that is there is </v>
<v Speaker 3>one element of your identity where </v>

562
00:32:15.431 --> 00:32:20.431
<v Speaker 3>you're an oppressor and so that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>sufficient justification to throw you in</v>

563
00:32:20.531 --> 00:32:24.040
<v Speaker 3>with the predators and do whatever is </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary to dispense with you.</v>

564
00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:26.500
<v Speaker 3>And that is exactly what happened in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>aftermath.</v>

565
00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:27.423
<v Speaker 3>Will not only of the Russian revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all of these radical leftist </v>

566
00:32:30.281 --> 00:32:31.870
<v Speaker 3>revolutions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

567
00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:33.753
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're a socialist while you're not </v>

568
00:32:34.451 --> 00:32:37.390
<v Speaker 3>sufficiently pure from a doctrinaire </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>

569
00:32:37.391 --> 00:32:38.224
<v Speaker 3>And if you're a student,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then you're part of the emerging </v>

570
00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:44.300
<v Speaker 3>bourgeois class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if your parents were reasonably,</v>

571
00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:46.910
<v Speaker 3>what would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Efficient farmers,</v>

572
00:32:46.911 --> 00:32:51.260
<v Speaker 3>then you're part of the Kulaks and like </v>
<v Speaker 3>it just went on and on and on and on.</v>

573
00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:53.600
<v Speaker 3>There wasn't anybody who escaped from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

574
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:56.150
<v Speaker 3>from being tarred with the brush of </v>
<v Speaker 3>oppressor.</v>

575
00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:57.103
<v Speaker 3>And that's because that is because each </v>
<v Speaker 3>of us are in fact oppressors and </v>

576
00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:04.040
<v Speaker 3>oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every single person shares both of those</v>

577
00:33:04.041 --> 00:33:06.230
<v Speaker 3>things in common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

578
00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:09.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got a couple of minutes left.</v>

579
00:33:09.271 --> 00:33:12.530
<v Speaker 2>So this might be quite a big question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just come back from the U.</v>

580
00:33:12.531 --> 00:33:13.364
<v Speaker 2>s where we interviewed pool vander clay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian pastor who's been doing quite </v>

581
00:33:16.081 --> 00:33:21.081
<v Speaker 2>a lot of videos about your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your thought he,</v>

582
00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:22.950
<v Speaker 2>one of his questions was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says he,</v>

583
00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:23.873
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a real sort of stoicism and your </v>

584
00:33:24.691 --> 00:33:28.560
<v Speaker 2>thought for pick up your cross and drag </v>
<v Speaker 2>it up the hill.</v>

585
00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:31.320
<v Speaker 2>His question is what's at the top of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hill?</v>

586
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:32.490
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't hear that.</v>

587
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:35.060
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's because he hasn't listened to the</v>

588
00:33:35.061 --> 00:33:38.390
<v Speaker 3>times when I've been talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess because I've said it repeatedly.</v>

589
00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:43.010
<v Speaker 3>You stumble up hill with your burden </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards the city of God.</v>

590
00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:45.390
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the store that does that.</v>

591
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:46.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean the city of gold</v>

592
00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:51.980
<v Speaker 3>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say that that's.</v>

593
00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:52.933
<v Speaker 3>That's a place where everyone bears </v>
<v Speaker 3>maximum responsibility and speaks the </v>

594
00:33:57.331 --> 00:34:00.120
<v Speaker 3>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>

595
00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:02.383
<v Speaker 3>And what's the responsibility?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're responsible for the suffering in </v>

596
00:34:05.811 --> 00:34:06.644
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're responsible for the malevolence </v>

597
00:34:09.021 --> 00:34:14.021
<v Speaker 3>in the world and you're responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the veracity of your utterances.</v>

598
00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.380
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in the city of God,</v>

599
00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:19.870
<v Speaker 3>you're maximally responsible for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering.</v>

600
00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:23.830
<v Speaker 3>You're maximally responsible for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>malevolence and you speak the truth.</v>

601
00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.560
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very concise.</v>

602
00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:31.780
<v Speaker 3>So you can tell them Paul van play that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

603
00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:33.220
<v Speaker 3>Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you very much.</v>

604
00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:34.870
<v Speaker 3>My pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nice to see you again.</v>

605
00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:35.933
<v Speaker 3>You take.</v>
