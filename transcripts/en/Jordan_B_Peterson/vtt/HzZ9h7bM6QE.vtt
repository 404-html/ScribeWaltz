1
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:04.723
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.630
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my name's Christine van Gyn.</v>

3
00:00:10.631 --> 00:00:14.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm currently the Ontario director of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Canadian Taxpayers Federation.</v>

4
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.960
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we work on issues of lower taxes,</v>

5
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.830
<v Speaker 2>government waste and accountability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And oddly enough,</v>

6
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.860
<v Speaker 2>this is the third time in six months </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I've done a speech or talk publicly</v>

7
00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:30.820
<v Speaker 2>about the issue of free speech and </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically free speech on campus.</v>

8
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.043
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that this is a defining topic </v>

9
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:35.523
<v Speaker 2>and mood of of 2017 and oddly support </v>
<v Speaker 2>for free speech is increasingly falling </v>

10
00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:47.011
<v Speaker 2>along partisan or ideological lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now CTF,</v>

11
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.573
<v Speaker 2>we at the Canadian Taxpayers Federation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we deal exclusively with fiscal and </v>

12
00:00:52.811 --> 00:00:57.250
<v Speaker 2>economic issues and you would think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that subject,</v>

13
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.790
<v Speaker 2>government debt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generational debt and balanced budgets,</v>

14
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.863
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would think that that's non </v>

15
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.310
<v Speaker 2>controversial but not so on university </v>
<v Speaker 2>campuses.</v>

16
00:01:06.311 --> 00:01:08.920
<v Speaker 2>Our student group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a generation screwed,</v>

17
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.993
<v Speaker 2>has been kicked off of campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had room space denied and we were even </v>

18
00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:14.164
<v Speaker 2>told by one university student union </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we may need to change our name </v>

19
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.160
<v Speaker 2>generation screwed because screwed is </v>
<v Speaker 2>oppressive.</v>

20
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.120
<v Speaker 2>So while we may not have encountered the</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of blow back that some of,</v>

21
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.113
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the speakers today will have </v>

22
00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:32.720
<v Speaker 2>received from universities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

23
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:33.783
<v Speaker 2>it just goes to show you how little it </v>
<v Speaker 2>takes to trigger a university </v>

24
00:01:37.871 --> 00:01:42.850
<v Speaker 2>administrators and students on campuses </v>
<v Speaker 2>and just how restrictive and ham fisted,</v>

25
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

26
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.990
<v Speaker 2>they can work at how they can act when </v>
<v Speaker 2>restricting speeds.</v>

27
00:01:46.991 --> 00:01:47.710
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

28
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.630
<v Speaker 2>with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will introduce our speakers.</v>

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.963
<v Speaker 2>mythology and political ideology,</v>

<v Speaker 2>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including the prediction of creativity,</v>

<v Speaker 2>academic and industrial performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everyone,</v>

58
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:16.720
<v Speaker 2>please welcome John and Peter</v>

59
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.600
<v Speaker 4>and we're going to begin with remarks </v>
<v Speaker 4>from Mr Sod.</v>

60
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 3>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

61
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.090
<v Speaker 4>so apparently a food restaurant or here </v>
<v Speaker 4>in Ottawa caused me some food poisoning.</v>

62
00:03:37.241 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 4>So even the restauranters are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>stifle my famous speech because I almost</v>

63
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:44.700
<v Speaker 4>didn't make it to the session.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

64
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.950
<v Speaker 4>so what are some strategies for stifling</v>
<v Speaker 4>opposing opinions?</v>

65
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:48.784
<v Speaker 4>If you live in a dictatorship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then of course you just killed the </v>

66
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:52.840
<v Speaker 4>intellectuals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those who oppose you,</v>

67
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.093
<v Speaker 4>you get rid of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you are unable to implement such a </v>

68
00:03:56.441 --> 00:03:57.274
<v Speaker 4>strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you perhaps have some hate speech </v>

69
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.043
<v Speaker 4>laws or some campus speech codes and of </v>
<v Speaker 4>course what flows from that is the </v>

70
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:06.604
<v Speaker 4>third.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A way to stifle people is to create an </v>

71
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:13.810
<v Speaker 4>environment that is sufficiently ominous</v>
<v Speaker 4>that people engage in self censorship.</v>

72
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.930
<v Speaker 4>This picture right here is worth a </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousand words.</v>

73
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.913
<v Speaker 4>It basically says we condemn freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 4>speech that hurts other people's </v>

74
00:04:23.551 --> 00:04:24.384
<v Speaker 4>feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I'm going to do for the rest of </v>

75
00:04:27.031 --> 00:04:27.864
<v Speaker 4>today's lecture is simply read to you </v>
<v Speaker 4>first person accounts of emails that I </v>

76
00:04:33.031 --> 00:04:35.340
<v Speaker 4>received.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I received these in there enumerable.</v>

77
00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:37.950
<v Speaker 4>How many I received were for either </v>
<v Speaker 4>students,</v>

78
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:38.813
<v Speaker 4>professors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>parents are writing to me to document </v>

79
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.950
<v Speaker 4>the stuff that they are facing on </v>
<v Speaker 4>campuses.</v>

80
00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:48.180
<v Speaker 4>And the best way to actually show you </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is to just read a bunch of them.</v>

81
00:04:48.181 --> 00:04:52.140
<v Speaker 4>So bear with me as I actually go through</v>
<v Speaker 4>about seven or eight of these.</v>

82
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.970
<v Speaker 4>The clock by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is not working.</v>

83
00:04:53.971 --> 00:04:56.580
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know how much time we have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'll assume we're okay.</v>

84
00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.863
<v Speaker 4>So here is a student testimony example </v>
<v Speaker 4>one I'm a 47 year old white male who </v>

85
00:05:02.071 --> 00:05:04.590
<v Speaker 4>because of an injury made a choice to </v>
<v Speaker 4>return to school.</v>

86
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.860
<v Speaker 4>Sadly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it looks like my path through university</v>

87
00:05:06.861 --> 00:05:10.620
<v Speaker 4>is going to be interrupted and the first</v>
<v Speaker 4>year to maintain full time status,</v>

88
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm forced to take another social </v>
<v Speaker 4>justice black lives matter.</v>

89
00:05:13.921 --> 00:05:14.754
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the challenge is students are not </v>

90
00:05:15.991 --> 00:05:19.890
<v Speaker 4>allowed to challenge or question the </v>
<v Speaker 4>course content because that's considered</v>

91
00:05:19.891 --> 00:05:23.250
<v Speaker 4>disrespectful and may disrupt someone's </v>
<v Speaker 4>safe space.</v>

92
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.510
<v Speaker 4>I believe I am a respectful students </v>
<v Speaker 4>with good attendance and who's the marks</v>

93
00:05:27.511 --> 00:05:28.344
<v Speaker 4>average in the mid eighties that said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after a few weeks of the one side is </v>

94
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.883
<v Speaker 4>syllabus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm considering dropping out of the </v>

95
00:05:32.881 --> 00:05:35.920
<v Speaker 4>program and leaving school entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This left,</v>

96
00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:37.980
<v Speaker 4>this academic world is a little too much</v>
<v Speaker 4>for me.</v>

97
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.833
<v Speaker 4>Testimony to today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had a panel discussion on the Quebec </v>

98
00:05:42.301 --> 00:05:43.134
<v Speaker 4>city shooting with two historians and </v>
<v Speaker 4>two sociologists where I was told with </v>

99
00:05:46.201 --> 00:05:47.034
<v Speaker 4>solid moral,</v>
<v Speaker 4>righteous stone that there is no such </v>

100
00:05:48.751 --> 00:05:49.584
<v Speaker 4>thing as good and bad immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My heart was racing and my teeth were </v>

101
00:05:53.431 --> 00:05:55.520
<v Speaker 4>clenched,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>

102
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.710
<v Speaker 4>and grinding to this.</v>

103
00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.573
<v Speaker 4>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the spite my heart beating out of my </v>

104
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:01.070
<v Speaker 4>chest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I asked a question,</v>

105
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.760
<v Speaker 4>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the panel interpret Charlie Hebdo,</v>

106
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:05.773
<v Speaker 4>the Danish cartoon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isis Salman Rushdie and the bataclan </v>

107
00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:08.984
<v Speaker 4>shootings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The denial of individual responsibility </v>

108
00:06:10.971 --> 00:06:14.840
<v Speaker 4>and complete disregard for any value </v>
<v Speaker 4>based interpretation was off the table.</v>

109
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.610
<v Speaker 4>I think I screwed myself because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty sure my professor is,</v>

110
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:20.623
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quite suspicious of me now because this </v>

111
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:26.210
<v Speaker 4>person aired his opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He knows that he's in trouble.</v>

112
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.660
<v Speaker 4>I just feel really alone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the thought of restoring strength,</v>

113
00:06:29.661 --> 00:06:34.520
<v Speaker 4>tolerance and diversity of factory </v>
<v Speaker 4>university really keeps me going today.</v>

114
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:38.390
<v Speaker 4>Just really proved to me that I'm up </v>
<v Speaker 4>against and how alone I am.</v>

115
00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:39.224
<v Speaker 4>What can I do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm reaching out to you in the hopes </v>

116
00:06:41.841 --> 00:06:42.674
<v Speaker 4>that the godfather that's yours truly</v>
<v Speaker 4>would be able to help direct my future </v>

117
00:06:47.961 --> 00:06:48.794
<v Speaker 4>research projects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Since most professors and required </v>

118
00:06:50.961 --> 00:06:51.794
<v Speaker 4>courses I have to take seem to be run by</v>
<v Speaker 4>Social Justice Warriors Feigning </v>

119
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:55.730
<v Speaker 4>Intellectual Ism.</v>

120
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.180
<v Speaker 4>The reason I'm contacting you is because</v>
<v Speaker 4>as an honors cognitive student,</v>

121
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:03.200
<v Speaker 4>part of my requirements is to complete </v>
<v Speaker 4>12 credits worth of individual research.</v>

122
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.620
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of purely political reasons,</v>

123
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm apparently a violent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>misogynist,</v>

124
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.003
<v Speaker 4>racist trump supporter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have not only lost my job at a </v>

125
00:07:13.431 --> 00:07:15.770
<v Speaker 4>prestigious behavioral neuroscience </v>
<v Speaker 4>laboratory.</v>

126
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:17.750
<v Speaker 4>I had the identity at why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why,</v>

127
00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:18.584
<v Speaker 4>why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my name has been removed from the </v>

128
00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:21.554
<v Speaker 4>publication on research I personally </v>
<v Speaker 4>conducted and the lead researcher told </v>

129
00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:28.520
<v Speaker 4>me that he would never work with me </v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

130
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.220
<v Speaker 4>This is not North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is Canada.</v>

131
00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:32.054
<v Speaker 4>This is US help.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fourth year student and a five </v>

132
00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:39.130
<v Speaker 4>year teaching program.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll be heading to why,</v>

133
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:39.570
<v Speaker 4>why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why,</v>

134
00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.710
<v Speaker 4>and next year for my one year of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Teacher's college,</v>

135
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:43.573
<v Speaker 4>only recently have I realized the </v>
<v Speaker 4>radical left wing messages embedded in </v>

136
00:07:47.331 --> 00:07:48.164
<v Speaker 4>virtually all of my classes and I know </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it will only get worse at the </v>

137
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.490
<v Speaker 4>school in question.</v>

138
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:54.043
<v Speaker 4>What can I do about this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do I stand up for the truth without </v>

139
00:07:56.541 --> 00:07:59.210
<v Speaker 4>risking my career as an elementary </v>
<v Speaker 4>school teacher?</v>

140
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.880
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's move on to some faculty.</v>

141
00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:02.714
<v Speaker 4>Those were all students.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I very much appreciate your courage to </v>

142
00:08:05.571 --> 00:08:09.050
<v Speaker 4>fight the cancer that is taking over </v>
<v Speaker 4>American academia.</v>

143
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.340
<v Speaker 4>People like me feel cheated and their </v>
<v Speaker 4>attempt to pursue a tenure track career.</v>

144
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.353
<v Speaker 4>It only takes a glimpse to the job </v>
<v Speaker 4>offerings that the modern language </v>

145
00:08:16.941 --> 00:08:17.774
<v Speaker 4>association publishes each year to </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand what is expected from recent </v>

146
00:08:21.591 --> 00:08:25.280
<v Speaker 4>graduates like me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is political activism and I refuse to</v>

147
00:08:25.281 --> 00:08:26.114
<v Speaker 4>mix that with my academic interests.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will save you my long stories of </v>

148
00:08:29.781 --> 00:08:30.614
<v Speaker 4>dealing and suffering career wise from </v>
<v Speaker 4>politically correct nonsense from the </v>

149
00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:35.390
<v Speaker 4>directions of feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gender,</v>

150
00:08:35.391 --> 00:08:38.320
<v Speaker 4>ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trans extremism and Islamophobia.</v>

151
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:42.170
<v Speaker 4>I am trying to keep a lid on things for </v>
<v Speaker 4>now as my wife is very,</v>

152
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.230
<v Speaker 4>as a very promising academic but hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>security position yet.</v>

153
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.460
<v Speaker 4>I know that if I started voicing my </v>
<v Speaker 4>thoughts and arguments on social media,</v>

154
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.460
<v Speaker 4>she'll be completely shut out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>academy.</v>

155
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:53.503
<v Speaker 4>If she does secure a tenure track spot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm off to the races and you and others </v>

156
00:08:57.061 --> 00:08:59.400
<v Speaker 4>would see that I'm an ally to take </v>
<v Speaker 4>notice of.</v>

157
00:08:59.401 --> 00:09:02.100
<v Speaker 4>Seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm more than happy to transition out of</v>

158
00:09:02.101 --> 00:09:02.934
<v Speaker 4>philosophy at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which has become a virtue signaling </v>

159
00:09:05.431 --> 00:09:06.264
<v Speaker 4>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As a fellow professor who has been </v>

160
00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:09.864
<v Speaker 4>frustrated by the discourse within </v>
<v Speaker 4>academia on issues such as political </v>

161
00:09:12.241 --> 00:09:14.100
<v Speaker 4>correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>moral relativism,</v>

162
00:09:14.101 --> 00:09:14.934
<v Speaker 4>and social justice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to thank you for speaking up </v>

163
00:09:16.771 --> 00:09:18.050
<v Speaker 4>the way you have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

164
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:18.943
<v Speaker 4>been from within academia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why my training and research as further </v>

165
00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:22.734
<v Speaker 4>removed from social issues than yours?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have nevertheless been frustrated by </v>

166
00:09:25.891 --> 00:09:28.770
<v Speaker 4>the conformism and group think I see and</v>
<v Speaker 4>hear around me.</v>

167
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:29.813
<v Speaker 4>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise very reasonable and capable </v>

168
00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:32.094
<v Speaker 4>people abandoning reason and counting to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the narrative of the regressive left on </v>

169
00:09:35.731 --> 00:09:36.720
<v Speaker 4>many social issues.</v>

170
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.793
<v Speaker 4>These are all things which I would like </v>
<v Speaker 4>to get involved in once the tenure </v>

171
00:09:40.231 --> 00:09:42.900
<v Speaker 4>decision is behind me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about one year to go.</v>

172
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:43.913
<v Speaker 4>As upsetting as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one fierce expressing unpopular social </v>

173
00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:47.544
<v Speaker 4>ideas prior to tenure and the meantime,</v>
<v Speaker 4>please keep fighting the good fight for </v>

174
00:09:51.031 --> 00:09:54.450
<v Speaker 4>freedom of speech and against start </v>
<v Speaker 4>policing and orthodoxy.</v>

175
00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.270
<v Speaker 4>Almost done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I won't read this whole one,</v>

176
00:09:57.271 --> 00:10:00.930
<v Speaker 4>but basically this person writes to me </v>
<v Speaker 4>and thanking me for my conversation with</v>

177
00:10:00.931 --> 00:10:01.764
<v Speaker 4>Sam Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 4>agreeing with some of the issues that I </v>

178
00:10:03.991 --> 00:10:07.080
<v Speaker 4>raised regarding some issues dealing </v>
<v Speaker 4>with Islam.</v>

179
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.093
<v Speaker 4>But then look at the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He says if you decide to mention this </v>

180
00:10:10.111 --> 00:10:10.944
<v Speaker 4>information in your videos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would ask that you do so without </v>

181
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.220
<v Speaker 4>mentioning my name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do not have tenure yet.</v>

182
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:20.280
<v Speaker 4>This is from uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

183
00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:22.290
<v Speaker 4>this is the last testimony and then I'll</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrap up.</v>

184
00:10:22.291 --> 00:10:24.540
<v Speaker 4>This is from a parent of a high school </v>
<v Speaker 4>student.</v>

185
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:25.973
<v Speaker 4>I recently received an email from my </v>
<v Speaker 4>son's school district that they are </v>

186
00:10:28.471 --> 00:10:31.770
<v Speaker 4>going to be screening a film called,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not racist,</v>

187
00:10:31.771 --> 00:10:35.820
<v Speaker 4>am I as an in school field trip at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>end of January for high school students.</v>

188
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:36.863
<v Speaker 4>I did some preliminary research on this </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm absolutely appalled at the </v>

189
00:10:40.351 --> 00:10:43.290
<v Speaker 4>content of the movie based on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>descriptions,</v>

190
00:10:43.291 --> 00:10:45.510
<v Speaker 4>the trailer and additional materials </v>
<v Speaker 4>surrounding it.</v>

191
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:49.940
<v Speaker 4>It appears to be a feature length film </v>
<v Speaker 4>pushing the agendas of white privilege,</v>

192
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.190
<v Speaker 4>institutional racism and white people </v>
<v Speaker 4>are the problem.</v>

193
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:54.653
<v Speaker 4>It's scares me beyond belief that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>are attempting to force these ideas on </v>

194
00:10:57.811 --> 00:11:02.811
<v Speaker 4>developing minds and now of course the </v>
<v Speaker 4>usual request that they be anonymous for</v>

195
00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:05.640
<v Speaker 4>reference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My son is a junior at xxx.</v>

196
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:06.683
<v Speaker 4>I have included the original email as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well as the pdf of the communication </v>

197
00:11:09.181 --> 00:11:11.880
<v Speaker 4>that was sent out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it is something you feel you should,</v>

198
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:13.560
<v Speaker 4>you should,</v>
<v Speaker 4>should be shared with others.</v>

199
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:14.603
<v Speaker 4>I only ask that you keep identifiable </v>
<v Speaker 4>information from my son or myself out </v>

200
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:24.210
<v Speaker 4>for our safety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not North Korea for his safety.</v>

201
00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:28.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So to conclude,</v>

202
00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:33.770
<v Speaker 4>freedom of speech is everything and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>should know I come from the Middle East.</v>

203
00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:38.460
<v Speaker 4>I escaped that which you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have replicate here in Canada.</v>

204
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.630
<v Speaker 4>So no more language police,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no more thought police,</v>

205
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.110
<v Speaker 4>no more echo chambers that sean </v>
<v Speaker 4>intellectual diversity,</v>

206
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:50.790
<v Speaker 4>no more identity politics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no more culture of offense and the ethos</v>

207
00:11:50.791 --> 00:11:54.180
<v Speaker 4>of perpetual victimhood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No micro</v>

208
00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.230
<v Speaker 5>aggressions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no trigger warnings,</v>

209
00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.620
<v Speaker 5>no safe spaces and no cultural </v>
<v Speaker 5>appropriation.</v>

210
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.190
<v Speaker 5>Science reason and logic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Trump,</v>

211
00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:06.070
<v Speaker 5>trump ideology and feelings.</v>

212
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.660
<v Speaker 3>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

213
00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:25.520
<v Speaker 5>is it okay to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to move this away please?</v>

214
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.620
<v Speaker 5>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good morning.</v>

<v Speaker 5>panel with Dr. Jordan Peterson and Dr </v>

218
00:12:43.231 --> 00:12:44.064
<v Speaker 5>Saad free speech in Canada is not dead,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but at Canadian universities it is </v>

219
00:12:50.221 --> 00:12:53.140
<v Speaker 5>certainly is on life support.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

220
00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:57.960
<v Speaker 5>each year of the Justice Center releases</v>

<v Speaker 5>very easily and quickly look up your own</v>

223

<v Speaker 5>university and see what letter grade a,</v>

226
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.420
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>based on its policies,</v>

227
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:18.263
<v Speaker 5>based on his practices.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're trying to follow Dr. Michael </v>

<v Speaker 5>Walkers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Great Dictum if it matters,</v>

231
00:13:35.131 --> 00:13:37.260
<v Speaker 5>Canadian universities.</v>

232
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.560
<v Speaker 5>The situation on the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

233
00:13:40.561 --> 00:13:43.260
<v Speaker 5>it's very bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are far more f's handed out.</v>

234
00:13:43.261 --> 00:13:44.094
<v Speaker 5>Then there are a letter grades and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Justice Center has been involved with </v>

235
00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:48.673
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>over 12 court actions against </v>

236
00:13:50.791 --> 00:13:53.640
<v Speaker 5>universities and student unions in four </v>
<v Speaker 5>provinces.</v>

237
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.553
<v Speaker 5>Fortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have had some successes a number of </v>

238
00:13:57.661 --> 00:13:58.494
<v Speaker 5>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The University of Calgary took it upon </v>

239
00:14:00.301 --> 00:14:01.134
<v Speaker 5>itself to sensor a small pro life group </v>
<v Speaker 5>on campus and threatened the students </v>

240
00:14:06.601 --> 00:14:07.434
<v Speaker 5>with a trespassing charges and even with</v>
<v Speaker 5>non academic misconduct charges with </v>

241
00:14:12.781 --> 00:14:13.614
<v Speaker 5>penalties ranging up to expulsion if </v>
<v Speaker 5>they continue to express their prolife </v>

242
00:14:17.421 --> 00:14:18.254
<v Speaker 5>us on campus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The students continued with her </v>

243
00:14:21.241 --> 00:14:22.074
<v Speaker 5>expression and they were indeed found </v>
<v Speaker 5>guilty of non academic misconduct for </v>

244
00:14:25.831 --> 00:14:29.280
<v Speaker 5>having done soul.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now the penalty was not expulsion,</v>

245
00:14:29.281 --> 00:14:30.114
<v Speaker 5>it was a warning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we took the university to court and </v>

246
00:14:32.761 --> 00:14:37.320
<v Speaker 5>in 2014 in the case of Wilson versus the</v>
<v Speaker 5>University of Calgary,</v>

247
00:14:37.321 --> 00:14:40.840
<v Speaker 5>we got a court ruling setting aside the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

248
00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:41.723
<v Speaker 5>university of Calgary's decision to find</v>
<v Speaker 5>the students guilty of non academic </v>

249
00:14:45.151 --> 00:14:45.984
<v Speaker 5>misconduct.</v>

250
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 3>So that case</v>

251
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.310
<v Speaker 5>is now a precedent that can be used by </v>
<v Speaker 5>students across Canada.</v>

252
00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:57.480
<v Speaker 5>We also recently,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

253
00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.820
<v Speaker 5>this past summer sued the Brandon </v>
<v Speaker 5>University student union,</v>

254
00:15:01.821 --> 00:15:02.654
<v Speaker 5>which had banned a campus prolife club,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which of course is significant because </v>

255
00:15:06.561 --> 00:15:08.420
<v Speaker 5>if you don't have the official club </v>
<v Speaker 5>status,</v>

256
00:15:08.421 --> 00:15:12.480
<v Speaker 5>you cannot participate in clubs day or </v>
<v Speaker 5>book a table or you,</v>

257
00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:16.730
<v Speaker 5>you cannot on par with the other clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>rent out a room or holding events,</v>

258
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.190
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>invite a speaker,</v>

259
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.580
<v Speaker 5>hosted debate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>et Cetera.</v>

260
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.193
<v Speaker 5>So we sued the student union at Brandon </v>
<v Speaker 5>University and before the action got </v>

261
00:15:26.181 --> 00:15:27.014
<v Speaker 5>very far,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they did settle and the re-instate of </v>

262
00:15:29.511 --> 00:15:32.540
<v Speaker 5>the club.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So another positive result.</v>

263
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:37.100
<v Speaker 5>But University is a very clever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we've got the University of Alberta,</v>

264
00:15:37.101 --> 00:15:37.934
<v Speaker 5>which is obviously aware of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>precedent against the University of </v>

265
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:42.463
<v Speaker 5>Calgary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So rather than censor speech directly </v>

266
00:15:43.701 --> 00:15:48.701
<v Speaker 5>itself with the university does,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it lets the mob sensor the expression</v>

267
00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:51.800
<v Speaker 5>that is unpopular.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So in 2015,</v>

268
00:15:51.801 --> 00:15:52.634
<v Speaker 5>the prolife group put up a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a peaceful stationary display and there </v>

269
00:15:57.491 --> 00:15:58.324
<v Speaker 5>was a huge mob of people came with </v>
<v Speaker 5>sheets and towels and banners and </v>

270
00:16:01.851 --> 00:16:06.830
<v Speaker 5>megaphones and swarmed it and rendered </v>
<v Speaker 5>it completely impossible to carry on any</v>

271
00:16:06.831 --> 00:16:09.710
<v Speaker 5>kind of civil conversation or dialogue </v>
<v Speaker 5>or debate.</v>

272
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:13.700
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in spite of the fact that the University</v>

273
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:18.700
<v Speaker 5>of Alberta's code of student behavior </v>
<v Speaker 5>expressly prohibits interrupting,</v>

274
00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:19.693
<v Speaker 5>obstructing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or interfering with university related </v>

275
00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:23.114
<v Speaker 5>activities and events in spite of very </v>
<v Speaker 5>clear provisions in the code of student </v>

276
00:16:26.901 --> 00:16:27.734
<v Speaker 5>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When this disruption and obstruction </v>

277
00:16:31.581 --> 00:16:36.050
<v Speaker 5>took place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>campus security stood by and watched and</v>

278
00:16:36.051 --> 00:16:38.450
<v Speaker 5>did nothing to enforce it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

279
00:16:38.451 --> 00:16:42.830
<v Speaker 5>on the university's own code of conduct,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the following year,</v>

280
00:16:42.831 --> 00:16:44.660
<v Speaker 5>2016,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the students went back,</v>

281
00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:45.573
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>filled out a form to have another </v>

282
00:16:46.401 --> 00:16:48.050
<v Speaker 5>display in the university says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

283
00:16:48.051 --> 00:16:48.884
<v Speaker 5>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can put up a display on campus </v>

284
00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:55.220
<v Speaker 5>provided that you pay us a security fee </v>
<v Speaker 5>of $17,500.</v>

285
00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:57.620
<v Speaker 5>Now of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're,</v>

286
00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:58.980
<v Speaker 5>if it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

287
00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.470
<v Speaker 5>campus gay pride March,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or if,</v>

288
00:17:01.471 --> 00:17:02.304
<v Speaker 5>if it's a feminist or socialist or </v>
<v Speaker 5>aboriginal or environmentalist </v>

289
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.823
<v Speaker 5>expression,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no security fee is required for </v>

290
00:17:08.691 --> 00:17:09.524
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if your opinion is unpopular or </v>

291
00:17:11.691 --> 00:17:12.524
<v Speaker 5>controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not allowed to express it on </v>

292
00:17:14.061 --> 00:17:18.530
<v Speaker 5>campus unless you pay a security fee of </v>
<v Speaker 5>$17,500.</v>

293
00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.553
<v Speaker 5>So we're suing the University of Alberta</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the court in Edmonton is going to </v>

294
00:17:23.181 --> 00:17:28.181
<v Speaker 5>hear our case coming up in June and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to be hugely,</v>

295
00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:30.390
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for,</v>

296
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:31.650
<v Speaker 5>for better or for worse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

297
00:17:31.651 --> 00:17:33.620
<v Speaker 5>you can't predict ahead of time if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll win or lose,</v>

298
00:17:33.621 --> 00:17:34.454
<v Speaker 5>but this is going to have a huge impact </v>
<v Speaker 5>on the rule of law because the message </v>

299
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:39.583
<v Speaker 5>that the University of Alberta is </v>
<v Speaker 5>sending to its own students sim to the </v>

300
00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:47.030
<v Speaker 5>whole world is that if you disagree with</v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody else's opinion,</v>

301
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:49.770
<v Speaker 5>you should shut them down and silence </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

302
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.020
<v Speaker 5>And that's the message,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

303
00:17:52.021 --> 00:17:53.220
<v Speaker 5>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's tempting,</v>

304
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:54.270
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

305
00:17:54.271 --> 00:17:55.104
<v Speaker 5>for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for people who disagree with or perhaps </v>

306
00:17:58.291 --> 00:18:02.490
<v Speaker 5>despise or detest the prolife viewpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's tempting to,</v>

307
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:04.760
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of chuck hole cause you know,</v>

308
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:09.060
<v Speaker 5>this is being shutdown,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it should be obvious to any thinking</v>

309
00:18:09.061 --> 00:18:09.894
<v Speaker 5>person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If this is the condone trend that's </v>

310
00:18:13.381 --> 00:18:14.214
<v Speaker 5>going to crack in all directions and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not going to be too long before </v>

311
00:18:16.711 --> 00:18:20.580
<v Speaker 5>you're going to see all kinds of views </v>
<v Speaker 5>and eventually even left wing views,</v>

312
00:18:20.581 --> 00:18:21.414
<v Speaker 5>they're going to get shut down by mobs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If this is not a font immediately and </v>

313
00:18:25.171 --> 00:18:29.730
<v Speaker 5>urgently what to do about the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got five recommendations.</v>

314
00:18:29.731 --> 00:18:31.980
<v Speaker 5>Firstly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exercise your free expression.</v>

315
00:18:31.981 --> 00:18:34.770
<v Speaker 5>Rights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Freedom is like a muscle.</v>

316
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:39.360
<v Speaker 5>If you don't exercise your muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they atrophy and weather and become weak</v>

317
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:41.370
<v Speaker 5>and useless.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Conversely,</v>

318
00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:44.640
<v Speaker 5>if you exercise your muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they stay strong and get even stronger.</v>

319
00:18:44.641 --> 00:18:45.474
<v Speaker 5>So exercise your free expression rights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do not be intimidated by the name </v>

320
00:18:48.301 --> 00:18:49.380
<v Speaker 5>calling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've all heard it.</v>

321
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:50.640
<v Speaker 5>Racist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sexist,</v>

322
00:18:50.641 --> 00:18:51.900
<v Speaker 5>homophobic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>transphobic,</v>

323
00:18:51.901 --> 00:18:53.070
<v Speaker 5>Islamophobic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>et Cetera,</v>

324
00:18:53.071 --> 00:18:55.680
<v Speaker 5>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you self censor,</v>

325
00:18:55.950 --> 00:19:00.120
<v Speaker 5>you are giving ground to the enemies of </v>
<v Speaker 5>freedom and</v>

326
00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:04.983
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

327
00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:09.690
<v Speaker 5>to make a commitment to the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's better to die standing them to live</v>

328
00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:10.524
<v Speaker 5>on your knees.</v>

329
00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.233
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

330
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.823
<v Speaker 5>second point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come to the defense of others whose </v>

331
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:23.730
<v Speaker 5>freedoms are threatened makes a huge </v>
<v Speaker 5>difference,</v>

332
00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:26.430
<v Speaker 5>especially if it's somebody that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>disagree with.</v>

333
00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:29.010
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Justice Center takes,</v>

334
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:30.070
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

335
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:32.400
<v Speaker 5>we have taken a position on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're not pro choice,</v>

336
00:19:32.401 --> 00:19:34.650
<v Speaker 5>we're not pro life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we're pro free speech.</v>

337
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:38.250
<v Speaker 5>So we take no position on abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As it turns out,</v>

338
00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:42.870
<v Speaker 5>most of our clients on university </v>
<v Speaker 5>campuses are pro life groups.</v>

339
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:46.260
<v Speaker 5>We're also acting for the men's Issues </v>
<v Speaker 5>Awareness Society,</v>

340
00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.020
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is suing the student's Union at a,</v>

341
00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:50.280
<v Speaker 5>at Ryerson University.</v>

342
00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:55.563
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sad to say that in most of these </v>

343
00:19:56.621 --> 00:19:57.454
<v Speaker 5>cases,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when a pro life group is getting </v>

344
00:19:59.321 --> 00:20:01.810
<v Speaker 5>censored by the university or by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>student union,</v>

345
00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:05.440
<v Speaker 5>in most cases,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get no help from the campus.</v>

346
00:20:05.441 --> 00:20:07.750
<v Speaker 5>Christian clubs get no help from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>campus,</v>

347
00:20:07.751 --> 00:20:09.310
<v Speaker 5>Jewish campus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Muslim campus,</v>

348
00:20:09.311 --> 00:20:11.800
<v Speaker 5>conservative clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're there all alone.</v>

349
00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:13.173
<v Speaker 5>You can make a huge difference if you </v>
<v Speaker 5>see somebody else being silenced or </v>

350
00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:19.240
<v Speaker 5>treated unfairly when you speak up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's especially powerful if you say,</v>

351
00:20:19.241 --> 00:20:21.130
<v Speaker 5>I don't agree with their viewpoint at </v>
<v Speaker 5>all,</v>

352
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:22.263
<v Speaker 5>but they have a right to speak their </v>
<v Speaker 5>opinions in a peaceful fashion on </v>

353
00:20:26.591 --> 00:20:27.424
<v Speaker 5>campus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what you're doing with your </v>

354
00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:30.610
<v Speaker 5>censorship is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's very powerful.</v>

355
00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:35.410
<v Speaker 5>So we need to do more of that is speak </v>
<v Speaker 5>up for others who are being persecuted.</v>

356
00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:37.810
<v Speaker 5>Thirdly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sign our petition.</v>

357
00:20:37.811 --> 00:20:40.360
<v Speaker 5>No taxpayer funding for universities.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That sensor,</v>

358
00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:41.793
<v Speaker 5>it's high time that universities were </v>
<v Speaker 5>stopped from perpetrating a fraud on </v>

359
00:20:48.251 --> 00:20:49.084
<v Speaker 5>taxpayers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which they do by going to the general </v>

360
00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:53.620
<v Speaker 5>public and to the politicians and </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying,</v>

361
00:20:53.621 --> 00:20:55.930
<v Speaker 5>we believe in academic inquiry.</v>

362
00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:58.660
<v Speaker 5>We believe in freedom of speech.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We believe in frank,</v>

363
00:20:58.661 --> 00:21:02.410
<v Speaker 5>honest debate as a tool for reaching </v>
<v Speaker 5>truth.</v>

364
00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.240
<v Speaker 5>And they get $13 billion per year from </v>
<v Speaker 5>taxpayers,</v>

365
00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:07.083
<v Speaker 5>most of it from provincial governments.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they take the 13 billion and </v>

366
00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.910
<v Speaker 5>turnaround and they don't even honor </v>
<v Speaker 5>their own mission and mandate.</v>

367
00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:16.420
<v Speaker 5>And that can be stopped by legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Provincially.</v>

368
00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.090
<v Speaker 5>Provinces simply have to amend the </v>
<v Speaker 5>legislation and say,</v>

369
00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:20.523
<v Speaker 5>universities are not getting money </v>
<v Speaker 5>unless he uphold free expression on </v>

370
00:21:22.811 --> 00:21:24.430
<v Speaker 5>campus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So please sign the petition.</v>

371
00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.290
<v Speaker 5>There's copies that are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

372
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:28.690
<v Speaker 5>justice center booth and there's also </v>
<v Speaker 5>copies in the,</v>

373
00:21:28.691 --> 00:21:32.320
<v Speaker 5>in the back of the room.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fourth Point,</v>

374
00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.173
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>support the groups that are defending </v>

375
00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.020
<v Speaker 5>the free society.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

376
00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:42.460
<v Speaker 5>don't assume that the organizations out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there that have their booths up,</v>

377
00:21:42.461 --> 00:21:43.091
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

378
00:21:43.091 --> 00:21:44.380
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a,</v>

379
00:21:44.381 --> 00:21:48.850
<v Speaker 5>there's a few billionaires that are all </v>
<v Speaker 5>giving these groups $100,000 a year.</v>

380
00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:50.740
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know with the Justice Center,</v>

381
00:21:50.741 --> 00:21:52.810
<v Speaker 5>and I think it's true for a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>groups out there,</v>

382
00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:58.020
<v Speaker 5>the majority of the money that we get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it comes in the form of the $200 or $500</v>

383
00:21:58.961 --> 00:22:00.340
<v Speaker 5>$100 donations.</v>

384
00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:03.970
<v Speaker 5>That's 60% of our budget.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So don't,</v>

385
00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:06.850
<v Speaker 5>don't leave it to some imaginary wealthy</v>
<v Speaker 5>person,</v>

386
00:22:06.851 --> 00:22:07.684
<v Speaker 5>but step up to the plates and support </v>
<v Speaker 5>the groups if you're not already doing </v>

387
00:22:10.391 --> 00:22:15.220
<v Speaker 5>so that are defending the free society.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Last but not least,</v>

388
00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:16.923
<v Speaker 5>when you yourself are in a situation </v>
<v Speaker 5>where your fundamental freedoms are </v>

389
00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:23.230
<v Speaker 5>being violated and whether it's your </v>
<v Speaker 5>freedom of expression,</v>

390
00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.410
<v Speaker 5>your freedom of conscience and religion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your freedom of association,</v>

391
00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:29.770
<v Speaker 5>stand your ground,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do not be intimidated.</v>

392
00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:31.413
<v Speaker 5>This is really where the war is fought.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Freedom is lost when people cave in and </v>

393
00:22:36.071 --> 00:22:39.730
<v Speaker 5>capitulate on fundamental points of </v>
<v Speaker 5>principle when they shouldn't.</v>

394
00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:41.230
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said earlier,</v>

395
00:22:41.231 --> 00:22:42.064
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a great honor to be on the same </v>

396
00:22:43.421 --> 00:22:48.421
<v Speaker 5>panel with Dr. Jordan Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If more Canadians showed the courage and</v>

397
00:22:49.181 --> 00:22:54.160
<v Speaker 5>fortitude that he is demonstrating on a </v>
<v Speaker 5>daily basis in the face of adversity,</v>

398
00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.100
<v Speaker 5>we'd be a lot better country.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

399
00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:02.660
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

400
00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.073
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

401
00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:13.700
<v Speaker 6>I want to recommend a book first to </v>
<v Speaker 6>everyone here.</v>

402
00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:18.730
<v Speaker 6>It's called explaining postmodernism and</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's by a gentleman named Steven Hicks.</v>

403
00:23:19.131 --> 00:23:19.964
<v Speaker 6>And you need to understand postmodernism</v>
<v Speaker 6>because that's what you're up against </v>

404
00:23:23.961 --> 00:23:27.530
<v Speaker 6>and you're up against it far more than </v>
<v Speaker 6>you know or think.</v>

405
00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:31.640
<v Speaker 6>And it's a much more well developed and </v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

406
00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:33.320
<v Speaker 6>pervasive,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pernicious,</v>

407
00:23:33.321 --> 00:23:34.154
<v Speaker 6>nihilistic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>intellectually attractive doctrine then </v>

408
00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:39.133
<v Speaker 6>has yet come to public realization had </v>
<v Speaker 6>absolutely dominates the humanities and </v>

409
00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:45.650
<v Speaker 6>increasingly the social sciences in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>universities.</v>

410
00:23:45.651 --> 00:23:47.780
<v Speaker 6>And what's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you see,</v>

411
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:50.810
<v Speaker 6>someone once said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who unfortunately I can't remember,</v>

412
00:23:50.811 --> 00:23:51.644
<v Speaker 6>it might've been Friedrich Nietzsche </v>
<v Speaker 6>said that everybody is the unconscious </v>

413
00:23:53.901 --> 00:23:56.960
<v Speaker 6>exponent of a dead philosopher.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

414
00:23:56.961 --> 00:23:59.240
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fortunately the postmodern philosophers,</v>

415
00:23:59.241 --> 00:24:01.220
<v Speaker 6>most of them are dead.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that's a good thing.</v>

416
00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:02.593
<v Speaker 6>But that doesn't mean that their words </v>
<v Speaker 6>aren't continually being spoken by </v>

417
00:24:05.601 --> 00:24:07.730
<v Speaker 6>people who,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who are following in their wake,</v>

418
00:24:07.731 --> 00:24:08.564
<v Speaker 6>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's not like any given person is </v>

419
00:24:10.341 --> 00:24:13.430
<v Speaker 6>absolutely possessed and say by the </v>
<v Speaker 6>spirit of postmodernism,</v>

420
00:24:13.431 --> 00:24:14.264
<v Speaker 6>because often they're not educated </v>
<v Speaker 6>enough to know all the details about </v>

421
00:24:16.971 --> 00:24:18.740
<v Speaker 6>what it is that has them in their grip.</v>

422
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:20.323
<v Speaker 6>But if you get 20 of them together and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're all 5% influenced by the </v>

423
00:24:23.541 --> 00:24:26.810
<v Speaker 6>postmodernist ethos,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you basically have the spirit of the mob</v>

424
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:30.020
<v Speaker 6>that's a mouthpiece for that particular </v>
<v Speaker 6>philosophical doctrine.</v>

425
00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:31.123
<v Speaker 6>And if you understand the doctrine,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then you understand why things are </v>

426
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:36.110
<v Speaker 6>progressing the way that they are </v>
<v Speaker 6>progressing.</v>

427
00:24:36.111 --> 00:24:38.480
<v Speaker 6>And so I'm going to tell you a little </v>
<v Speaker 6>bit about the doctrine,</v>

428
00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:39.883
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because it's not optional to understand </v>

429
00:24:41.601 --> 00:24:42.434
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's absolutely crucial to understand </v>

430
00:24:44.301 --> 00:24:45.134
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>huh?</v>

431
00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:48.430
<v Speaker 6>You can't underestimate the power of </v>
<v Speaker 6>ideas and,</v>

432
00:24:48.431 --> 00:24:52.070
<v Speaker 6>and also the power of words of course,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because ideas are expressed in words,</v>

433
00:24:52.071 --> 00:24:52.904
<v Speaker 6>but you see the postmodernists </v>
<v Speaker 6>completely reject the structure of </v>

434
00:24:56.961 --> 00:24:59.570
<v Speaker 6>Western civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I mean completely.</v>

435
00:24:59.571 --> 00:25:01.490
<v Speaker 6>So I can give you an example in one </v>
<v Speaker 6>term,</v>

436
00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.473
<v Speaker 6>Jacques Derrida whose head trickster for</v>
<v Speaker 6>the postmodernist movement regarded </v>

437
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:07.393
<v Speaker 6>Western culture,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's call it the patriarchy as fellow </v>

438
00:25:09.801 --> 00:25:11.180
<v Speaker 6>go centric.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

439
00:25:11.181 --> 00:25:13.580
<v Speaker 6>So fallow comes from Phallus,</v>
<v Speaker 6>p,</v>

440
00:25:13.581 --> 00:25:14.301
<v Speaker 6>h a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>l,</v>

441
00:25:14.301 --> 00:25:15.134
<v Speaker 6>l,</v>
<v Speaker 6>o.</v>

442
00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:15.973
<v Speaker 6>And so that's the insistence that what </v>
<v Speaker 6>you see in Western culture is the </v>

443
00:25:18.801 --> 00:25:21.680
<v Speaker 6>consequence of a male dominated,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oppressive,</v>

444
00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.410
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>self serving society.</v>

445
00:25:24.411 --> 00:25:25.730
<v Speaker 6>And we might say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

446
00:25:25.731 --> 00:25:28.130
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>societies do tend to be self serving and</v>

447
00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.310
<v Speaker 6>people in power do tend to act in their </v>
<v Speaker 6>best interests,</v>

448
00:25:31.311 --> 00:25:32.144
<v Speaker 6>but a tendency is not an absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's one of the things that needs </v>

449
00:25:35.691 --> 00:25:36.524
<v Speaker 6>to be considered continually.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There are no shortage of flaws in the </v>

450
00:25:39.591 --> 00:25:41.780
<v Speaker 6>manner in which we've structured our </v>
<v Speaker 6>society.</v>

451
00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:46.430
<v Speaker 6>And compared to any hypothetical utopia,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's an absolutely dismal wreck.</v>

452
00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:47.293
<v Speaker 6>But compared to the rest of the world </v>
<v Speaker 6>and the plight of other societies </v>

453
00:25:50.361 --> 00:25:51.194
<v Speaker 6>throughout the history of mankind,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're doing pretty damn well and we </v>

454
00:25:53.301 --> 00:25:55.610
<v Speaker 6>should be happy to be living in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>society that we're living in.</v>

455
00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:59.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the first</v>

456
00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:01.043
<v Speaker 6>thing that you might want to note about </v>
<v Speaker 6>postmodernism is that it doesn't have a </v>

457
00:26:03.181 --> 00:26:04.014
<v Speaker 6>shred of gratitude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And there's something pathologically </v>

458
00:26:06.961 --> 00:26:08.350
<v Speaker 6>wrong with a person who does have,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

459
00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:11.550
<v Speaker 6>doesn't have any gratitude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially when they live in what so far</v>

460
00:26:11.551 --> 00:26:12.384
<v Speaker 6>is the best of all possible worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so if you're not great for your </v>

461
00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:16.253
<v Speaker 6>driven by resentment and resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is the boat the worst emotion that you </v>

462
00:26:18.931 --> 00:26:21.330
<v Speaker 6>can possibly experience apart from </v>
<v Speaker 6>arrogancy,</v>

463
00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.710
<v Speaker 6>resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>arrogance,</v>

464
00:26:22.711 --> 00:26:25.470
<v Speaker 6>and deceit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's an evil triad for you,</v>

465
00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:28.230
<v Speaker 6>and if you're bitter about everything </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's happening around you,</v>

466
00:26:28.231 --> 00:26:30.390
<v Speaker 6>despite the fact that you're bathed in </v>
<v Speaker 6>wealth,</v>

467
00:26:30.391 --> 00:26:32.040
<v Speaker 6>then there's something absolutely wrong </v>
<v Speaker 6>with you.</v>

468
00:26:32.041 --> 00:26:34.140
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the black community in the United States</v>

469
00:26:34.141 --> 00:26:38.790
<v Speaker 6>is the 18th wealthiest community,</v>
<v Speaker 6>18th wealthiest nation on the planet.</v>

470
00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:40.043
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that doesn't mean there isn't such a </v>

471
00:26:40.561 --> 00:26:42.720
<v Speaker 6>thing as relative poverty in relative </v>
<v Speaker 6>poverty.</v>

472
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.333
<v Speaker 6>It's an important,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's an important political economic </v>

473
00:26:46.171 --> 00:26:46.861
<v Speaker 6>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's very,</v>

474
00:26:46.861 --> 00:26:48.060
<v Speaker 6>very difficult to deal with.</v>

475
00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.193
<v Speaker 6>But absolute wealth matters too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the western societies have been </v>

476
00:26:51.691 --> 00:26:55.080
<v Speaker 6>absolutely remarkable in their ability </v>
<v Speaker 6>to generate and distribute wealth.</v>

477
00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.830
<v Speaker 6>As you can tell by just looking around </v>
<v Speaker 6>and taking a,</v>

478
00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:58.943
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a brief bit of consideration for the </v>

479
00:27:00.031 --> 00:27:02.730
<v Speaker 6>absolute miracle that even a building </v>
<v Speaker 6>like this represents.</v>

480
00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.490
<v Speaker 6>So you have to educate yourself about </v>
<v Speaker 6>postmodernism.</v>

481
00:27:05.491 --> 00:27:06.324
<v Speaker 6>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So here's what the postmodernists </v>

482
00:27:07.171 --> 00:27:09.450
<v Speaker 6>belief.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't believe in the individual.</v>

483
00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:10.403
<v Speaker 6>That's the logos park.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Western culture is fell logo centric </v>

484
00:27:13.351 --> 00:27:16.500
<v Speaker 6>logo is logos.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's partly the Christian word,</v>

485
00:27:16.501 --> 00:27:18.840
<v Speaker 6>but it's also partly the root word of </v>
<v Speaker 6>logic,</v>

486
00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.420
<v Speaker 6>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't believe in logic.</v>

487
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.433
<v Speaker 6>They believe that logic is part of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>process by which the patriarchal </v>

488
00:27:25.651 --> 00:27:30.240
<v Speaker 6>institutions of the West continue to </v>
<v Speaker 6>dominate and to justify their dominance.</v>

489
00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:34.230
<v Speaker 6>They don't believe in dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The root word of dialogue is logos.</v>

490
00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:35.103
<v Speaker 6>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they don't believe that people of </v>

491
00:27:36.571 --> 00:27:40.950
<v Speaker 6>goodwill can come to consensus through </v>
<v Speaker 6>the x through the exchange of ideas.</v>

492
00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:42.053
<v Speaker 6>They believe that that notion is part of</v>
<v Speaker 6>the philosophical substructure and </v>

493
00:27:46.261 --> 00:27:47.094
<v Speaker 6>practices of the dominant culture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the reason they don't let people who </v>

494
00:27:49.831 --> 00:27:50.664
<v Speaker 6>they don't agree with speak on campuses </v>
<v Speaker 6>because they don't agree with letting </v>

495
00:27:53.461 --> 00:27:55.410
<v Speaker 6>people speak.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You see?</v>

496
00:27:55.411 --> 00:27:57.720
<v Speaker 6>It's not part of the ethos.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

497
00:27:57.721 --> 00:27:59.820
<v Speaker 6>so what else do they believe and not </v>
<v Speaker 6>believe?</v>

498
00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.193
<v Speaker 6>They believe that you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>since you don't have an individual </v>

499
00:28:02.641 --> 00:28:03.474
<v Speaker 6>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your fundamental identity is group </v>

500
00:28:04.921 --> 00:28:05.754
<v Speaker 6>fostered.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that means that you're basically an </v>

501
00:28:07.561 --> 00:28:10.620
<v Speaker 6>exemplar of your race,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hanse white privilege,</v>

502
00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:14.250
<v Speaker 6>or you're an exemplar of your gender or </v>
<v Speaker 6>your sex or your ethnicity,</v>

503
00:28:14.251 --> 00:28:18.730
<v Speaker 6>or your an exemplar of however you can </v>
<v Speaker 6>be classified so that you,</v>

504
00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:23.160
<v Speaker 6>you are placed in the position of victim</v>
<v Speaker 6>against the oppressor.</v>

505
00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.830
<v Speaker 6>Because that's the game and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

506
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.290
<v Speaker 6>it's a post Marxist sleight of hand,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

507
00:28:28.291 --> 00:28:29.124
<v Speaker 6>The old Marxist notion was that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>world was a battleground between the </v>

508
00:28:32.341 --> 00:28:34.080
<v Speaker 6>burrs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>waze and the proletariat.</v>

509
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:39.470
<v Speaker 6>And that a failed to have any </v>
<v Speaker 6>philosophical or ethical standing.</v>

510
00:28:40.111 --> 00:28:40.944
<v Speaker 6>That argument after the working class </v>
<v Speaker 6>actually saw its standard of living </v>

511
00:28:44.311 --> 00:28:48.630
<v Speaker 6>massively elevated as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 6>of Western corporate democracy,</v>

512
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:53.160
<v Speaker 6>a Western free enterprise democracy and </v>
<v Speaker 6>also b.</v>

513
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:54.023
<v Speaker 6>And and also as a consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>revelations of everything terrible that </v>

514
00:28:56.791 --> 00:29:00.810
<v Speaker 6>it happened in every bloody country that</v>
<v Speaker 6>ever dared to make equity.</v>

515
00:29:00.811 --> 00:29:01.644
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the Marxist communist dogma part of </v>

516
00:29:04.561 --> 00:29:06.090
<v Speaker 6>their fundamental structure,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

517
00:29:06.091 --> 00:29:08.340
<v Speaker 6>And nothing but murderousness and </v>
<v Speaker 6>oppression.</v>

518
00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:12.840
<v Speaker 6>And so by the 1970s it was evident that </v>
<v Speaker 6>that game was up the postmark,</v>

519
00:29:12.841 --> 00:29:13.674
<v Speaker 6>the postmodernist Marxist just barely </v>
<v Speaker 6>basically pulled a sleight of hand and </v>

520
00:29:16.471 --> 00:29:16.981
<v Speaker 6>said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

521
00:29:16.981 --> 00:29:17.814
<v Speaker 6>if it's not the poor against the rich,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's the oppressed against the </v>

522
00:29:20.641 --> 00:29:21.740
<v Speaker 6>oppressor.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'll just read,</v>

523
00:29:21.741 --> 00:29:24.660
<v Speaker 6>divide the subpopulations in ways that </v>
<v Speaker 6>make our,</v>

524
00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.750
<v Speaker 6>our bloody philosophy continuing its in </v>
<v Speaker 6>its,</v>

525
00:29:27.751 --> 00:29:30.570
<v Speaker 6>in its movement forward.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's where we're at now.</v>

526
00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.920
<v Speaker 6>And so for the postmodernists,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the world is a hobbsy in battleground of</v>

527
00:29:34.921 --> 00:29:37.890
<v Speaker 6>identity groups.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They do not communicate with one another</v>

528
00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:41.320
<v Speaker 6>because they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All there is is a struggle for power.</v>

529
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:44.350
<v Speaker 6>And if you're in the Predator group,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which means you're an oppressor,</v>

530
00:29:44.351 --> 00:29:47.170
<v Speaker 6>then you better look out because you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>not exactly welcome.</v>

531
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:49.840
<v Speaker 6>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not exactly welcome and neither are your</v>

532
00:29:49.841 --> 00:29:52.450
<v Speaker 6>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that's what you're up against.</v>

533
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:53.463
<v Speaker 6>I would say it's time for conservatives </v>
<v Speaker 6>to stop apologizing for being </v>

534
00:29:55.931 --> 00:29:57.570
<v Speaker 6>conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

535
00:29:57.571 --> 00:29:58.404
<v Speaker 6>and</v>

536
00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:07.220
<v Speaker 6>you don't apologize to these people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a big mistake.</v>

537
00:30:07.221 --> 00:30:09.530
<v Speaker 6>Apology there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They read apology as a,</v>

538
00:30:09.531 --> 00:30:11.450
<v Speaker 6>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as an admission of guilt.</v>

539
00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.670
<v Speaker 6>You don't apologize and you don't back </v>
<v Speaker 6>down.</v>

540
00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.550
<v Speaker 6>You young people that are out there who </v>
<v Speaker 6>are university students,</v>

541
00:30:16.551 --> 00:30:18.350
<v Speaker 6>you need to take over the student </v>
<v Speaker 6>unions,</v>

542
00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.273
<v Speaker 6>you need to take them back because </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're absolute snake pits and they </v>

543
00:30:21.201 --> 00:30:22.190
<v Speaker 6>haven't been since the [inaudible].</v>

544
00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:23.510
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

545
00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.280
<v Speaker 6>And with regards with regards to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>universities,</v>

546
00:30:30.281 --> 00:30:31.114
<v Speaker 6>I thought at one point that the best </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing to do would be to cut their </v>

547
00:30:32.801 --> 00:30:33.634
<v Speaker 6>funding by 25% let them fight amongst </v>
<v Speaker 6>themselves for the remnants because it </v>

548
00:30:37.061 --> 00:30:40.450
<v Speaker 6>would force the universities to decide </v>
<v Speaker 6>exactly what's important and what isn't.</v>

549
00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:41.643
<v Speaker 6>So I would say the humanities and much </v>
<v Speaker 6>of the social sciences have has turned </v>

550
00:30:44.531 --> 00:30:47.680
<v Speaker 6>into a postmodern Neil Marxists </v>
<v Speaker 6>playground for radicals.</v>

551
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:48.663
<v Speaker 6>The scholarship is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>80% of humanities papers aren't cited </v>

552
00:30:51.821 --> 00:30:53.560
<v Speaker 6>once,</v>
<v Speaker 6>once.</v>

553
00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:54.573
<v Speaker 6>And so what that means is that they </v>
<v Speaker 6>write papers for each other and they </v>

554
00:30:56.741 --> 00:30:59.230
<v Speaker 6>sell them to libraries.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's how the publishers make their</v>

555
00:30:59.231 --> 00:31:00.064
<v Speaker 6>money and no one reads them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the publishers can print them </v>

556
00:31:01.631 --> 00:31:02.464
<v Speaker 6>because the libraries have to buy them </v>
<v Speaker 6>and they're buying them with your tax </v>

557
00:31:04.751 --> 00:31:05.584
<v Speaker 6>money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so all of you who are sitting here </v>

558
00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:12.150
<v Speaker 6>are funding and our postmodern radical </v>
<v Speaker 6>neo Marxist agenda that has its roots in</v>

559
00:31:12.821 --> 00:31:15.280
<v Speaker 6>the university and your tax money is </v>
<v Speaker 6>going towards that.</v>

560
00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:16.323
<v Speaker 6>And if you want proof of that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you just go online and look at the </v>

561
00:31:18.641 --> 00:31:19.474
<v Speaker 6>websites,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially of of disciplines like </v>

562
00:31:21.011 --> 00:31:22.750
<v Speaker 6>women's studies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is pathological,</v>

563
00:31:22.751 --> 00:31:23.584
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>To the core.</v>

564
00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:26.760
<v Speaker 6>But it's not just women's studies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's all the ethnic studies group,</v>

565
00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:32.340
<v Speaker 6>it's anthropology,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's sociology,</v>

566
00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:33.203
<v Speaker 6>it's social work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And most of all it's education and </v>

567
00:31:35.851 --> 00:31:36.990
<v Speaker 6>noisy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>

568
00:31:36.991 --> 00:31:40.560
<v Speaker 6>in Ontario is perhaps apart from the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Ontario Human Rights Commission,</v>

569
00:31:40.561 --> 00:31:42.540
<v Speaker 6>the most dangerous institution in </v>
<v Speaker 6>Canada.</v>

570
00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:49.640
<v Speaker 6>It should be defunded.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's as simple as that.</v>

571
00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:51.710
<v Speaker 6>They don't do the research they purport </v>
<v Speaker 6>to do.</v>

572
00:31:51.711 --> 00:31:53.020
<v Speaker 6>They're not interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

573
00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.800
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>at all in education.</v>

574
00:31:54.801 --> 00:31:59.150
<v Speaker 6>They're interested in the indoctrination</v>
<v Speaker 6>of people as young as they can fund a as</v>

575
00:31:59.151 --> 00:32:01.760
<v Speaker 6>young as they can get their hands on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so to speak.</v>

576
00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:02.923
<v Speaker 6>Now we need to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>our society needs to figure out how to </v>

577
00:32:05.241 --> 00:32:09.800
<v Speaker 6>stop shunting public tax money to </v>
<v Speaker 6>radical left wing activists.</v>

578
00:32:09.801 --> 00:32:12.260
<v Speaker 6>If we were doing that for radical right </v>
<v Speaker 6>wing activists there,</v>

579
00:32:12.261 --> 00:32:13.094
<v Speaker 6>it'd be an absolute storm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it's happened incrementally since </v>

580
00:32:15.501 --> 00:32:19.150
<v Speaker 6>the 1960s and it needs to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that's,</v>

581
00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:22.970
<v Speaker 6>that's partly what the Conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not only conservatives,</v>

582
00:32:22.971 --> 00:32:23.804
<v Speaker 6>but also liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>true liberals in the English sands are </v>

583
00:32:26.001 --> 00:32:26.990
<v Speaker 6>up against.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

584
00:32:26.991 --> 00:32:30.860
<v Speaker 6>what's happened as also as a consequence</v>
<v Speaker 6>of this postmodern,</v>

585
00:32:30.861 --> 00:32:34.790
<v Speaker 6>neo Marxist intellectual invasion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that the center keeps moving.</v>

586
00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:37.700
<v Speaker 6>It's moved way to the right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So if you're a classic liberal,</v>

587
00:32:37.701 --> 00:32:40.820
<v Speaker 6>you've become a conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so for all of you who are interested</v>

588
00:32:40.821 --> 00:32:41.654
<v Speaker 6>in pursuing the conservative agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of classic liberals that </v>

589
00:32:44.571 --> 00:32:46.850
<v Speaker 6>you could be talking to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then finally,</v>

590
00:32:46.851 --> 00:32:47.684
<v Speaker 6>with regards to talking to young people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you finally have something to sell to </v>

591
00:32:50.061 --> 00:32:50.750
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

592
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:53.930
<v Speaker 6>it's not easy to sell conservatism to </v>
<v Speaker 6>young people because they want to change</v>

593
00:32:53.931 --> 00:32:54.764
<v Speaker 6>things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's not what conservatives want </v>

594
00:32:55.941 --> 00:32:57.680
<v Speaker 6>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They want to maintain things.</v>

595
00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:00.080
<v Speaker 6>Well now you've got something to sell to</v>
<v Speaker 6>young people.</v>

596
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:05.120
<v Speaker 6>You can sell them freedom of speech and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you can tell sell them responsibility.</v>

597
00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.280
<v Speaker 6>The left is selling them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

598
00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:08.383
<v Speaker 6>You can sell them responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I can tell you because I received </v>

599
00:33:10.701 --> 00:33:13.790
<v Speaker 6>many letters of the sort that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that God was talking about,</v>

600
00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:14.863
<v Speaker 6>young people are absolutely starving for</v>
<v Speaker 6>someone to provide them with a sense of </v>

601
00:33:17.811 --> 00:33:19.220
<v Speaker 6>responsibility and say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

602
00:33:19.221 --> 00:33:20.950
<v Speaker 6>here's something worth living for,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

603
00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:25.690
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

604
00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:27.413
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can find meaning in life with </v>

605
00:33:28.291 --> 00:33:29.400
<v Speaker 6>freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but freedom.</v>

606
00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:31.590
<v Speaker 6>Freedom is a chaotic sort of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

607
00:33:31.591 --> 00:33:33.120
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and freedom isn't the sort of thing that</v>

608
00:33:33.121 --> 00:33:35.520
<v Speaker 6>makes people happy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the sort of thing that makes people</v>

609
00:33:35.521 --> 00:33:37.110
<v Speaker 6>troublesome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Troubled because,</v>

610
00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:40.470
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>freedom expands your,</v>

611
00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:44.160
<v Speaker 6>you're a series of choices and that </v>
<v Speaker 6>makes you nervous and uncertain.</v>

612
00:33:44.161 --> 00:33:46.620
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but responsibility is another.</v>

613
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:49.410
<v Speaker 6>Not to say that that's a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a good thing,</v>

614
00:33:49.411 --> 00:33:49.890
<v Speaker 6>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

615
00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:50.723
<v Speaker 6>it requires that you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that you shoulder the responsibility of </v>

616
00:33:53.941 --> 00:33:54.774
<v Speaker 6>the freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But responsibility per se is what gives </v>

617
00:33:56.701 --> 00:33:59.970
<v Speaker 6>your life meaning genuine meaning in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>face of suffering.</v>

618
00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:03.450
<v Speaker 6>And you and young people are really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're starving for that.</v>

619
00:34:03.451 --> 00:34:06.540
<v Speaker 6>I've been teaching young people for 30 </v>
<v Speaker 6>years and mostly what I've been teaching</v>

620
00:34:06.541 --> 00:34:07.374
<v Speaker 6>them about his responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like your errors to a great </v>

621
00:34:10.351 --> 00:34:13.170
<v Speaker 6>tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not perfect obviously,</v>

622
00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:15.410
<v Speaker 6>but comparatively,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

623
00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:18.130
<v Speaker 6>there's nothing else like it that's ever</v>
<v Speaker 6>been produced and it's,</v>

624
00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:20.660
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it represents a tiny minority of,</v>

625
00:34:20.661 --> 00:34:21.371
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>

626
00:34:21.371 --> 00:34:23.640
<v Speaker 6>of the human politics,</v>
<v Speaker 6>most of which are,</v>

627
00:34:23.910 --> 00:34:24.810
<v Speaker 6>are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>are,</v>

628
00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:27.490
<v Speaker 6>are run by murderous,</v>
<v Speaker 6>antisocial,</v>

629
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.070
<v Speaker 6>psychopathic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

630
00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:31.420
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>thugs and that,</v>

631
00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:34.740
<v Speaker 6>that's seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so what kind of alternative is that?</v>

632
00:34:34.741 --> 00:34:38.100
<v Speaker 6>We've got this beacon of freedom and </v>
<v Speaker 6>wealth in the West that works,</v>

633
00:34:38.101 --> 00:34:40.980
<v Speaker 6>although it doesn't work perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And one of the,</v>

634
00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:44.730
<v Speaker 6>one of the responsibilities of young </v>
<v Speaker 6>people is to find out what's at the core</v>

635
00:34:44.731 --> 00:34:46.170
<v Speaker 6>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The great,</v>

636
00:34:46.171 --> 00:34:48.600
<v Speaker 6>great core of that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that the paramount,</v>

637
00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:52.650
<v Speaker 6>the paramount importance of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>individual and the divinity of speech.</v>

638
00:34:52.651 --> 00:34:54.300
<v Speaker 6>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's some to sell.</v>

639
00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:56.640
<v Speaker 6>It's what our whole culture is </v>
<v Speaker 6>predicated on.</v>

640
00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:01.960
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

641
00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:02.873
<v Speaker 6>well I should start there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So thank you very much for the </v>

642
00:35:04.261 --> 00:35:05.094
<v Speaker 6>invitation.</v>

643
00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:14.050
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

644
00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:15.760
<v Speaker 7>thank you very much to all of our </v>
<v Speaker 7>speakers.</v>

645
00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.830
<v Speaker 7>Really insightful comments.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

646
00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:20.440
<v Speaker 7>I'm just going to lead a better 20 </v>
<v Speaker 7>minute discussion,</v>

647
00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.360
<v Speaker 7>15 minute discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

648
00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:25.750
<v Speaker 7>and my first question is the direction </v>
<v Speaker 7>in which we're going.</v>

649
00:35:25.751 --> 00:35:26.720
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

650
00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:29.730
<v Speaker 7>there was a pool that was published by </v>
<v Speaker 7>the Economist and uh,</v>

651
00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:30.593
<v Speaker 7>I think tuition is ago that showed the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the support among young people for </v>

652
00:35:35.621 --> 00:35:38.490
<v Speaker 7>different sets of rights in different </v>
<v Speaker 7>countries across the world.</v>

653
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:39.623
<v Speaker 7>And they found that support for the </v>
<v Speaker 7>expansion of rights that are considered </v>

654
00:35:42.991 --> 00:35:45.630
<v Speaker 7>rights for historically marginalized </v>
<v Speaker 7>groups.</v>

655
00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.910
<v Speaker 7>So the right for women's equality,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

656
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:50.510
<v Speaker 7>right to same sex marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Rachel abortion,</v>

657
00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:54.240
<v Speaker 7>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Even in countries where those rights are</v>

658
00:35:54.241 --> 00:35:59.241
<v Speaker 7>not in trying in law has incredible </v>
<v Speaker 7>amounts of support among young people.</v>

659
00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:02.970
<v Speaker 7>The only exception is the right to free </v>
<v Speaker 7>speech,</v>

660
00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:03.893
<v Speaker 7>particularly the right to speech that </v>
<v Speaker 7>may be perceived as offensive to </v>

661
00:36:08.761 --> 00:36:12.570
<v Speaker 7>minority groups in that category.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Countries like Britain,</v>

662
00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:16.050
<v Speaker 7>Germany and Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the support among young people for that,</v>

663
00:36:16.051 --> 00:36:20.670
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's under 50% so right now we have,</v>

664
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:22.560
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we see,</v>

665
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:23.543
<v Speaker 7>we see censorship,</v>
<v Speaker 7>self censorship and real state </v>

666
00:36:25.771 --> 00:36:28.860
<v Speaker 7>censorship by people who actually hold </v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

667
00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:33.240
<v Speaker 7>the leavers of power in government and </v>
<v Speaker 7>in institutions.</v>

668
00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:34.373
<v Speaker 7>But when these people who right now have</v>
<v Speaker 7>less than 50% support for the right to </v>

669
00:36:38.311 --> 00:36:39.144
<v Speaker 7>free speech are 15 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the ones holding those leavers and </v>

670
00:36:42.211 --> 00:36:43.770
<v Speaker 7>power,</v>
<v Speaker 7>where do you see this going?</v>

671
00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:46.360
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

672
00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:50.640
<v Speaker 8>the short term future is very bleak,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I,</v>

673
00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:51.723
<v Speaker 8>I always say you just got to keep on </v>
<v Speaker 8>fighting for what is right and </v>

674
00:36:56.410 --> 00:37:01.410
<v Speaker 8>exercising courage and we can't see what</v>
<v Speaker 8>the medium term or long term future is.</v>

675
00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:05.050
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

676
00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:06.280
<v Speaker 8>the history is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>is,</v>

677
00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:10.150
<v Speaker 8>is quite unpredictable,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but the short term trends are terrible.</v>

678
00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:11.263
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think another thing for people in the </v>

679
00:37:13.961 --> 00:37:14.794
<v Speaker 8>audience who are parents is you don't </v>
<v Speaker 8>get your kids out of the public </v>

680
00:37:17.651 --> 00:37:19.540
<v Speaker 8>education system.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And,</v>

681
00:37:19.541 --> 00:37:20.374
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>do homeschooling or private school make </v>

682
00:37:22.701 --> 00:37:23.890
<v Speaker 8>that a priority.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

683
00:37:23.891 --> 00:37:24.724
<v Speaker 8>even if you can't afford it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>figure out a way because this </v>

684
00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:32.100
<v Speaker 8>indoctrination into these postmodernist </v>
<v Speaker 8>or neo Marxist type ideas,</v>

685
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:35.400
<v Speaker 8>it just permeates the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

686
00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.000
<v Speaker 8>curriculum.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Whether it's math,</v>

687
00:37:37.001 --> 00:37:38.290
<v Speaker 8>science,</v>
<v Speaker 8>social studies,</v>

688
00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:41.050
<v Speaker 8>what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So that's something practical.</v>

689
00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:42.880
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>certainly the,</v>

690
00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:45.490
<v Speaker 8>the students that are now 18,</v>
<v Speaker 8>19,</v>

691
00:37:45.491 --> 00:37:48.370
<v Speaker 8>20,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's obvious that in high school they've</v>

692
00:37:48.371 --> 00:37:52.750
<v Speaker 8>never been taught that if there's an </v>
<v Speaker 8>idea that you disagree with,</v>

693
00:37:52.751 --> 00:37:53.584
<v Speaker 8>while you had come up with reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 8>that's wrong and you try to use facts </v>

694
00:37:57.191 --> 00:38:00.320
<v Speaker 8>and logic to engage in discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's a,</v>

695
00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.233
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it,</v>

696
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:03.280
<v Speaker 8>they've got these mobs as,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

697
00:38:03.281 --> 00:38:07.600
<v Speaker 8>what I feel very offended by by what you</v>
<v Speaker 8>said,</v>

698
00:38:07.601 --> 00:38:10.360
<v Speaker 8>I feel that way and therefore you </v>
<v Speaker 8>shouldn't be allowed to say it.</v>

699
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:12.640
<v Speaker 8>What were they getting that from?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

700
00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:16.000
<v Speaker 8>that's coming out of the K to 12 </v>
<v Speaker 8>education system.</v>

701
00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:18.623
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

702
00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:24.190
<v Speaker 8>One of the things that I tried to do is </v>
<v Speaker 8>to convince both colleagues and students</v>

703
00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:27.040
<v Speaker 8>and anybody who's willing to listen to </v>
<v Speaker 8>participate,</v>

704
00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:29.860
<v Speaker 8>participate in the trench warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm ideas.</v>

705
00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:33.700
<v Speaker 8>Many people feel as though they don't </v>
<v Speaker 8>have the necessary platform,</v>

706
00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:36.250
<v Speaker 8>unnecessary testicular</v>

707
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:37.083
<v Speaker 9>fortitude to actually battle.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But then they see gentlemen like Jordan </v>

708
00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:44.200
<v Speaker 9>Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 9>if I may include myself and a few others</v>

709
00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:47.920
<v Speaker 9>who are on the front lines and then they</v>
<v Speaker 9>feel very invigorated.</v>

710
00:38:47.921 --> 00:38:52.540
<v Speaker 9>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think the ship can be turned around as</v>

711
00:38:52.541 --> 00:38:53.374
<v Speaker 9>long as people feel sufficiently </v>
<v Speaker 9>empowered that they actually have a </v>

712
00:38:55.961 --> 00:38:56.794
<v Speaker 9>voice.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You could wait in simply on your </v>

713
00:38:59.351 --> 00:39:00.184
<v Speaker 9>facebook page.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You could weigh in at the bar when </v>

714
00:39:01.781 --> 00:39:02.614
<v Speaker 9>speaking to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 9>everybody has a voice and everybody </v>

715
00:39:04.691 --> 00:39:05.524
<v Speaker 9>should feel sufficiently invigorated and</v>
<v Speaker 9>the possibility of lending their voice </v>

716
00:39:09.551 --> 00:39:11.170
<v Speaker 9>to the debate.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And if we can do that,</v>

717
00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.150
<v Speaker 9>then I don't think we need to be </v>
<v Speaker 9>pessimistic.</v>

718
00:39:13.151 --> 00:39:13.984
<v Speaker 9>If we can't convince people to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>then I think it will be an infinite </v>

719
00:39:17.051 --> 00:39:20.530
<v Speaker 9>abyss of darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So you know,</v>

720
00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:21.663
<v Speaker 9>one way of conceptualizing yourself is </v>
<v Speaker 9>that your one speck of dust among 7 </v>

721
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:28.870
<v Speaker 9>billion.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And when you conceptualize yourself that</v>

722
00:39:28.871 --> 00:39:29.621
<v Speaker 9>way,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you might think,</v>

723
00:39:29.621 --> 00:39:30.790
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what difference does it make?</v>

724
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:31.623
<v Speaker 9>What I say or do?</v>
<v Speaker 9>And that it's actually quite convenient </v>

725
00:39:33.461 --> 00:39:34.294
<v Speaker 9>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Because if it doesn't matter what you </v>

726
00:39:35.471 --> 00:39:37.660
<v Speaker 9>say or do,</v>
<v Speaker 9>then you don't have any responsibility.</v>

727
00:39:37.661 --> 00:39:40.450
<v Speaker 9>And you can do whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the price you pay for that.</v>

728
00:39:40.451 --> 00:39:41.284
<v Speaker 9>It's a bit of nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But if you don't have to shoulder any </v>

729
00:39:42.911 --> 00:39:46.420
<v Speaker 9>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that's a small price to pay another.</v>

730
00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:49.300
<v Speaker 9>That's the underground motivation for </v>
<v Speaker 9>nihilism.</v>

731
00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:52.690
<v Speaker 9>But the other way of looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and this is actually the accurate way of</v>

732
00:39:52.691 --> 00:39:54.790
<v Speaker 9>looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 9>is that you're in a network,</v>

733
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.863
<v Speaker 9>you're a node in a network,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and so you can do a little bit of </v>

734
00:39:57.971 --> 00:40:01.540
<v Speaker 9>arithmetic very rapidly and just </v>
<v Speaker 9>figuring out how powerful you are.</v>

735
00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:05.440
<v Speaker 9>You know a thousand people,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you're going to know more than that over</v>

736
00:40:05.441 --> 00:40:07.810
<v Speaker 9>the course of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but let's say a thousand for the sake of</v>

737
00:40:07.811 --> 00:40:10.390
<v Speaker 9>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 9>For now they know a thousand people.</v>

738
00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:11.493
<v Speaker 9>That means that you're one person away </v>
<v Speaker 9>from a million people and two persons </v>

739
00:40:14.351 --> 00:40:17.980
<v Speaker 9>away from a billion people and you're </v>
<v Speaker 9>the center of that network.</v>

740
00:40:17.981 --> 00:40:18.814
<v Speaker 9>And now the way networks work is that </v>
<v Speaker 9>information propagates in a network </v>

741
00:40:21.491 --> 00:40:24.940
<v Speaker 9>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So don't underestimate the power of your</v>

742
00:40:24.941 --> 00:40:26.380
<v Speaker 9>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Now,</v>

743
00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:29.290
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>western culture is fell logo centric.</v>

744
00:40:29.291 --> 00:40:30.130
<v Speaker 9>Let's say it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Okay?</v>

745
00:40:30.131 --> 00:40:30.941
<v Speaker 9>So we'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 9>yeah,</v>

746
00:40:30.941 --> 00:40:32.800
<v Speaker 9>that's just fine.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's exactly what it is.</v>

747
00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:34.680
<v Speaker 9>It's predicated on the idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 9>logos,</v>

748
00:40:34.681 --> 00:40:38.200
<v Speaker 9>that the logos is the sacred element of </v>
<v Speaker 9>Western culture.</v>

749
00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:39.213
<v Speaker 9>And what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 9>It means that your capacity for speech </v>

750
00:40:41.691 --> 00:40:44.800
<v Speaker 9>is divine.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's the thing that generates order from</v>

751
00:40:44.801 --> 00:40:45.634
<v Speaker 9>chaos and then sometimes turns </v>
<v Speaker 9>pathological order into chaos when it </v>

752
00:40:48.491 --> 00:40:51.640
<v Speaker 9>has to.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Don't underestimate the power of truth.</v>

753
00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:52.683
<v Speaker 9>There's nothing more powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Now in order to speak what you might </v>

754
00:40:56.231 --> 00:40:59.230
<v Speaker 9>regard as the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you have to let go of the outcome.</v>

755
00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:01.330
<v Speaker 9>You have to think,</v>
<v Speaker 9>all right,</v>

756
00:41:01.331 --> 00:41:04.570
<v Speaker 9>I'm going to say what I think stupid as </v>
<v Speaker 9>I am biased,</v>

757
00:41:04.571 --> 00:41:05.404
<v Speaker 9>as I am ignorant as I am,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm going to state what I think as </v>

758
00:41:08.771 --> 00:41:09.604
<v Speaker 9>clearly as I can and I'm going to live </v>
<v Speaker 9>with the consequences no matter what </v>

759
00:41:13.571 --> 00:41:14.404
<v Speaker 9>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Now the reason you think that that's an </v>

760
00:41:16.901 --> 00:41:20.350
<v Speaker 9>element of faith,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the idea is that nothing brings a better</v>

761
00:41:20.351 --> 00:41:21.184
<v Speaker 9>world into being then misstated truth.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Now you might have to pay a price for </v>

762
00:41:25.481 --> 00:41:26.410
<v Speaker 9>that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but that's fine.</v>

763
00:41:26.411 --> 00:41:27.244
<v Speaker 9>You're going to pay a price for every </v>
<v Speaker 9>bloody thing you do and everything you </v>

764
00:41:30.071 --> 00:41:30.904
<v Speaker 9>don't do.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You don't get to choose to not pay a </v>

765
00:41:32.651 --> 00:41:33.484
<v Speaker 9>price.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You get to choose which poison you're </v>

766
00:41:35.391 --> 00:41:37.370
<v Speaker 9>going to take.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's it.</v>

767
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:40.040
<v Speaker 9>So if you're going to stand up for </v>
<v Speaker 9>something,</v>

768
00:41:40.041 --> 00:41:41.480
<v Speaker 9>stand up for your truth,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it'll,</v>

769
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:42.343
<v Speaker 9>it'll shape you because people will </v>
<v Speaker 9>respond and object and tell you why you </v>

770
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:48.020
<v Speaker 9>a fool and a biased moron,</v>
<v Speaker 9>why you're ignorant.</v>

771
00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:52.250
<v Speaker 9>And then if you listen to them,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you'll be just that much less like that.</v>

772
00:41:52.251 --> 00:41:55.430
<v Speaker 9>The next time you say something and if </v>
<v Speaker 9>you do that for five years,</v>

773
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:56.563
<v Speaker 9>you'll be so damn tough and articulate </v>
<v Speaker 9>and able to communicate and withstand </v>

774
00:41:59.541 --> 00:42:02.060
<v Speaker 9>pressure that you won't even recognize </v>
<v Speaker 9>yourself.</v>

775
00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:06.320
<v Speaker 9>And then you'll be a force to contend </v>
<v Speaker 9>with and you don't get to wait until,</v>

776
00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:07.283
<v Speaker 9>because I get letters like Gad,</v>
<v Speaker 9>Saad gets all the time too from to </v>

777
00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:11.870
<v Speaker 9>members in particular and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>

778
00:42:11.871 --> 00:42:14.880
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>when I get tenure slight,</v>

779
00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:15.890
<v Speaker 9>then they think,</v>
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>

780
00:42:15.891 --> 00:42:18.110
<v Speaker 9>when I'm an associate professor,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and then they think,</v>

781
00:42:18.111 --> 00:42:19.610
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>when I'm a full professor,</v>

782
00:42:19.611 --> 00:42:24.170
<v Speaker 9>it's like if you're a professor already,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you're like the most protected person in</v>

783
00:42:24.171 --> 00:42:25.880
<v Speaker 9>the history of the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

784
00:42:25.881 --> 00:42:26.390
<v Speaker 9>and,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and you,</v>

785
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:27.223
<v Speaker 9>you,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you need,</v>

786
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:28.100
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>okay,</v>

787
00:42:28.101 --> 00:42:30.290
<v Speaker 9>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 9>one of the things that that indicates is</v>

788
00:42:30.291 --> 00:42:33.840
<v Speaker 9>that it's almost impossible to provide </v>
<v Speaker 9>people with enough protection.</v>

789
00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:36.110
<v Speaker 9>So that they feel safe to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Okay,</v>

790
00:42:36.111 --> 00:42:36.944
<v Speaker 9>so we'll address that directly.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It is not safe to speak and it never </v>

791
00:42:41.751 --> 00:42:42.980
<v Speaker 9>will be,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but the,</v>

792
00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:47.660
<v Speaker 9>the thing you got to keep in mind is </v>
<v Speaker 9>that it's even less safe not to speak,</v>

793
00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:49.730
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's a balance of risks.</v>

794
00:42:49.731 --> 00:42:50.564
<v Speaker 9>It's like you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you want to pay the price for being who </v>

795
00:42:52.431 --> 00:42:55.100
<v Speaker 9>you are and stating your mode of being </v>
<v Speaker 9>in the world.</v>

796
00:42:55.101 --> 00:42:55.934
<v Speaker 9>Or do you want to pay the price for </v>
<v Speaker 9>being a bloody surf one that's enslaved </v>

797
00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:02.210
<v Speaker 9>him or herself?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

798
00:43:02.211 --> 00:43:03.044
<v Speaker 9>that's a major price man.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That thing unfolds over decades and </v>

799
00:43:05.301 --> 00:43:09.290
<v Speaker 9>you'll just be miserable worm at the end</v>
<v Speaker 9>of about 20 years of that,</v>

800
00:43:09.291 --> 00:43:11.000
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>No self respect,</v>

801
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:14.360
<v Speaker 9>no power,</v>
<v Speaker 9>no ability to voice your opinions,</v>

802
00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:18.500
<v Speaker 9>nothing left but resentment because </v>
<v Speaker 9>everyone's against you because of course</v>

803
00:43:18.501 --> 00:43:23.501
<v Speaker 9>you've never stood up for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's like say what you think carefully.</v>

804
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:26.030
<v Speaker 9>Pay attention to your words,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the prices.</v>

805
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:29.660
<v Speaker 9>It's a price you want to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 9>If you are willing to believe that truth</v>

806
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:34.370
<v Speaker 9>is the cornerstone of society.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And in the most real sense,</v>

807
00:43:34.371 --> 00:43:35.001
<v Speaker 9>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 9>if you,</v>

808
00:43:35.001 --> 00:43:39.110
<v Speaker 9>if you're willing to take that leap,</v>
<v Speaker 9>then tell the truth and see what happens</v>

809
00:43:39.111 --> 00:43:41.630
<v Speaker 9>and nothing better could possibly happen</v>
<v Speaker 9>to you.</v>

810
00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:42.973
<v Speaker 9>There'll be ups and downs and there'll </v>
<v Speaker 9>be pushback and there'll be controversy </v>

811
00:43:45.561 --> 00:43:47.930
<v Speaker 9>in all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But it doesn't matter.</v>

812
00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:48.793
<v Speaker 9>The truth is what makes the world the </v>
<v Speaker 9>truth is what redeems the world from </v>

813
00:43:53.361 --> 00:43:55.700
<v Speaker 9>Hell.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And that's the truth.</v>

814
00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:58.640
<v Speaker 9>And we saw plenty of hell for the last </v>
<v Speaker 9>hundred years,</v>

815
00:43:58.641 --> 00:43:59.474
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and we haven't learned a bloody thing </v>

816
00:44:00.651 --> 00:44:02.840
<v Speaker 9>from it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's like wake up,</v>

817
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:05.450
<v Speaker 9>tell the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 9>tell the truth,</v>

818
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:08.990
<v Speaker 9>or at least don't lie.</v>
<v Speaker 9>If that's a start and you go,</v>

819
00:44:08.991 --> 00:44:11.750
<v Speaker 9>you gotta understand that's a risk.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But I will,</v>

820
00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.680
<v Speaker 9>one more brief thing to say about that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

821
00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:16.760
<v Speaker 9>so,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

822
00:44:16.761 --> 00:44:21.050
<v Speaker 9>I said what I had to say back in </v>
<v Speaker 9>September and I'm sure that I could have</v>

823
00:44:21.051 --> 00:44:21.884
<v Speaker 9>done it better.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And many people have told me how I </v>

824
00:44:23.121 --> 00:44:23.954
<v Speaker 9>could've done it better,</v>
<v Speaker 9>although it didn't mean they would </v>

825
00:44:25.371 --> 00:44:26.300
<v Speaker 9>actually do it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

826
00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:28.500
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

827
00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:35.920
<v Speaker 9>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>my job was at risk,</v>

828
00:44:35.921 --> 00:44:36.754
<v Speaker 9>serious risk for about two months and </v>
<v Speaker 9>these stabilized my family been very </v>

829
00:44:39.701 --> 00:44:42.670
<v Speaker 9>brains about this.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So like thumbs up to their mandate</v>

830
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.080
<v Speaker 3>just stood by him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the OP,</v>

831
00:44:47.081 --> 00:44:48.070
<v Speaker 3>here's the optimist</v>

832
00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:50.630
<v Speaker 9>stick news is the university has left me</v>
<v Speaker 9>alone completely.</v>

833
00:44:50.631 --> 00:44:52.370
<v Speaker 9>I shook hands with the dean two weeks </v>
<v Speaker 9>ago.</v>

834
00:44:52.371 --> 00:44:53.204
<v Speaker 9>We're on friendly terms.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They don't want this to go any farther </v>

835
00:44:55.041 --> 00:44:55.874
<v Speaker 9>than it has already.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The students were tremendously </v>

836
00:44:57.231 --> 00:44:59.210
<v Speaker 9>welcoming.</v>
<v Speaker 9>When I came back to teach in January,</v>

837
00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:00.193
<v Speaker 9>I haven't had a single negative incident</v>
<v Speaker 9>at the university and I've received </v>

838
00:45:02.961 --> 00:45:05.660
<v Speaker 9>thousands of letters from people all </v>
<v Speaker 9>over the world,</v>

839
00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:09.920
<v Speaker 9>all of which have been in support.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I've received two negative letters.</v>

840
00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:15.070
<v Speaker 9>That's it to the people.</v>
<v Speaker 9>People have it in Kuwait,</v>

841
00:45:15.651 --> 00:45:19.070
<v Speaker 9>longing to have the sort of thing that </v>
<v Speaker 9>we're talking about articulated.</v>

842
00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:23.720
<v Speaker 9>And so don't be thinking you're alone.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's just that people can't talk,</v>

843
00:45:23.721 --> 00:45:25.970
<v Speaker 9>they're afraid to talk or they don't </v>
<v Speaker 9>know what to say.</v>

844
00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:27.830
<v Speaker 9>And,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and those are real problems.</v>

845
00:45:27.831 --> 00:45:28.664
<v Speaker 9>So if you're reasonably articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 9>like start talking and sharpen yourself </v>

846
00:45:32.661 --> 00:45:34.400
<v Speaker 9>up.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean the enemy is,</v>

847
00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:36.590
<v Speaker 9>is a cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Their cloud is nat.</v>

848
00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:39.470
<v Speaker 9>They're only courageous in groups.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They're only courageous.</v>

849
00:45:39.471 --> 00:45:40.304
<v Speaker 9>And moms,</v>
<v Speaker 9>if you stand your ground and don't </v>

850
00:45:42.081 --> 00:45:44.180
<v Speaker 9>apologize and articulate things </v>
<v Speaker 9>properly,</v>

851
00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:47.360
<v Speaker 9>they'll disperse around you.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like they're not even there.</v>

852
00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:52.070
<v Speaker 9>So most of it's illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So don't be be afraid,</v>

853
00:45:52.071 --> 00:45:54.740
<v Speaker 9>but be afraid of the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And the right thing you should be afraid</v>

854
00:45:54.741 --> 00:45:58.520
<v Speaker 9>of is not saying what you say.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Cause that's the same as not being.</v>

855
00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:03.470
<v Speaker 9>And here you are suffering away.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You might as well be at the same time,</v>

856
00:46:03.471 --> 00:46:06.140
<v Speaker 9>at least then there's something to you.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So,</v>

857
00:46:13.090 --> 00:46:13.923
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

858
00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:14.903
<v Speaker 7>one of the other things I wanted to ask </v>
<v Speaker 7>your opinion about is what rule do </v>

859
00:46:17.911 --> 00:46:21.240
<v Speaker 7>provocateurs play in the debate over </v>
<v Speaker 7>free speech?</v>

860
00:46:21.241 --> 00:46:22.074
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

861
00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:25.380
<v Speaker 7>the example of the day is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is obviously Milo Yiannopoulos.</v>

862
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:29.100
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>are these champions of free speech or do</v>

863
00:46:29.101 --> 00:46:34.080
<v Speaker 7>they undermine public support for the </v>
<v Speaker 7>right or are they simply self interested</v>

864
00:46:34.081 --> 00:46:34.914
<v Speaker 7>people who are hijacking a right in </v>
<v Speaker 7>order to promote themselves and their </v>

865
00:46:38.461 --> 00:46:40.140
<v Speaker 7>own interests?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

866
00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:44.220
<v Speaker 7>and obviously is this a new phenomenon </v>
<v Speaker 7>or is this something that is,</v>

867
00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:45.600
<v Speaker 7>is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is age.</v>

868
00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:51.050
<v Speaker 9>They're all of those.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Marlowe is a classic example.</v>

869
00:46:51.051 --> 00:46:52.760
<v Speaker 9>He's an amazing person.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

870
00:46:52.761 --> 00:46:54.380
<v Speaker 9>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 9>he's a contradiction.</v>

871
00:46:54.381 --> 00:46:57.080
<v Speaker 9>He's a walking contradiction.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You can't pin that guy down,</v>

872
00:46:57.081 --> 00:46:57.531
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like,</v>

873
00:46:57.531 --> 00:47:00.170
<v Speaker 9>what is he half Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 9>half English gay,</v>

874
00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.670
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>Catholic,</v>

875
00:47:01.671 --> 00:47:03.410
<v Speaker 9>provocateur Catholic.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Who's,</v>

876
00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:04.760
<v Speaker 9>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 9>who's really,</v>

877
00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:05.721
<v Speaker 9>who's really,</v>
<v Speaker 9>yeah.</v>

878
00:47:05.721 --> 00:47:08.630
<v Speaker 9>Who loves black guys and who,</v>
<v Speaker 9>who,</v>

879
00:47:08.631 --> 00:47:11.270
<v Speaker 9>who is it?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Who Appeals to American Republicans?</v>

880
00:47:11.271 --> 00:47:12.104
<v Speaker 9>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what are you going to say about </v>

881
00:47:13.611 --> 00:47:14.990
<v Speaker 9>something?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Somebody like that.</v>

882
00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:16.580
<v Speaker 9>It's like he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 9>he's a,</v>

883
00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:19.010
<v Speaker 9>he's a trickster figure.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Archetypically speaking,</v>

884
00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:19.903
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and he's,</v>

885
00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:23.780
<v Speaker 9>he's a provocateur and a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And the funny thing about Comedians,</v>

886
00:47:23.781 --> 00:47:25.520
<v Speaker 9>they're like gestures in the king's </v>
<v Speaker 9>court.</v>

887
00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:26.563
<v Speaker 9>The gesture was the only person who </v>
<v Speaker 9>could tell the truth because he was </v>

888
00:47:28.371 --> 00:47:29.204
<v Speaker 9>beneath contempt.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And that's the role that comedians and </v>

889
00:47:31.931 --> 00:47:33.880
<v Speaker 9>provocateurs play.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They're poking,</v>

890
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:37.750
<v Speaker 9>they're poking and laughing and making </v>
<v Speaker 9>fun and you know,</v>

891
00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:39.760
<v Speaker 9>Milo Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 9>even dresses like,</v>

892
00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:41.550
<v Speaker 9>what do you call those?</v>

893
00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:43.270
<v Speaker 9>A Harlequin,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

894
00:47:43.271 --> 00:47:46.960
<v Speaker 9>he's a trickster and trickster figures,</v>
<v Speaker 9>emergent times of crisis.</v>

895
00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:51.070
<v Speaker 9>And they point out what no one wants to </v>
<v Speaker 9>see and they say things that no one will</v>

896
00:47:51.071 --> 00:47:51.904
<v Speaker 9>say.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You can say all the terrible things </v>

897
00:47:53.291 --> 00:47:54.580
<v Speaker 9>about him.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He is a provocateur,</v>

898
00:47:54.581 --> 00:47:55.950
<v Speaker 9>he's an EGOMANIAC,</v>
<v Speaker 9>he's a,</v>

899
00:47:56.650 --> 00:48:00.400
<v Speaker 9>I don't think he's narcissistic,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but because he has the real capacity for</v>

900
00:48:00.401 --> 00:48:01.960
<v Speaker 9>self reflection,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but,</v>

901
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:04.780
<v Speaker 9>and he's brave as can be.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

902
00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:08.590
<v Speaker 9>and,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and he's unstoppable on his feet.</v>

903
00:48:08.591 --> 00:48:10.960
<v Speaker 9>He just amazes me.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I've never seen anyone ever,</v>

904
00:48:10.961 --> 00:48:11.794
<v Speaker 9>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and I've met some pretty damn smart </v>

905
00:48:12.971 --> 00:48:13.804
<v Speaker 9>people.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I've never seen anyone who can take on </v>

906
00:48:15.941 --> 00:48:18.040
<v Speaker 9>an onslaught of criticism and reverse </v>
<v Speaker 9>it.</v>

907
00:48:18.041 --> 00:48:19.900
<v Speaker 9>Like he county.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's bloody amazing.</v>

908
00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:21.970
<v Speaker 9>But he is all those things you </v>
<v Speaker 9>described,</v>

909
00:48:21.971 --> 00:48:26.971
<v Speaker 9>but you know the times call forth us the</v>
<v Speaker 9>speakers and we've called Forth Milo.</v>

910
00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:30.533
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well then that tells you what our times </v>

911
00:48:31.561 --> 00:48:35.220
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Milo's been on my show and he's supposed</v>

912
00:48:35.221 --> 00:48:37.050
<v Speaker 4>to come against him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's at,</v>

913
00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:40.740
<v Speaker 4>he's exactly the things that Jordan said</v>
<v Speaker 4>at times.</v>

914
00:48:40.741 --> 00:48:43.770
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he has an ability to depart from truth.</v>

915
00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.690
<v Speaker 4>You're speaking to shy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>

916
00:48:45.691 --> 00:48:48.840
<v Speaker 4>when he says things like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is no such thing as lesbians.</v>

917
00:48:50.850 --> 00:48:51.683
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate his provocateur nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then it'd be nice to stay closer to </v>

918
00:48:56.461 --> 00:48:57.294
<v Speaker 4>the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But to the extent that he is getting a </v>

919
00:48:58.771 --> 00:49:03.150
<v Speaker 4>lot of young people engaged probably </v>
<v Speaker 4>more than Jordan and I could,</v>

920
00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:04.573
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in our lifetimes a lot of people are </v>

921
00:49:06.151 --> 00:49:09.450
<v Speaker 4>associating to him and so as a central </v>
<v Speaker 4>message is truly important.</v>

922
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:13.440
<v Speaker 4>So even if once in a while he makes a </v>
<v Speaker 4>departure from truth,</v>

923
00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:16.970
<v Speaker 4>our grant him that because his greater,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

924
00:49:17.130 --> 00:49:19.920
<v Speaker 4>his own death is quite important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I certainly support them.</v>

925
00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:24.160
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>just add that a is the so called extreme</v>

926
00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:25.263
<v Speaker 8>speech that pushes the envelope and that</v>
<v Speaker 8>ends up in the long run being </v>

927
00:49:29.531 --> 00:49:34.531
<v Speaker 8>fundamentally transformative.</v>
<v Speaker 8>W The top question ask always is,</v>

928
00:49:35.591 --> 00:49:36.424
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>is it true or to what extent is a true </v>

929
00:49:38.171 --> 00:49:39.004
<v Speaker 8>or why is it not true?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Truth is always the thing too to think </v>

930
00:49:41.471 --> 00:49:42.304
<v Speaker 8>about.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We should never be concerned with </v>

931
00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:46.720
<v Speaker 8>whether something is quote extreme or </v>
<v Speaker 8>not.</v>

932
00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:50.680
<v Speaker 8>Cause that changes from year to year,</v>
<v Speaker 8>from decade to decade.</v>

933
00:49:50.681 --> 00:49:51.850
<v Speaker 8>I mean you think,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

934
00:49:51.851 --> 00:49:56.851
<v Speaker 8>in 1969 it would have been extreme to </v>
<v Speaker 8>advocate for gay marriage.</v>

935
00:49:58.150 --> 00:50:01.240
<v Speaker 8>That would have been an extreme position</v>
<v Speaker 8>with less than 1% support.</v>

936
00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:02.403
<v Speaker 8>And today in many quarters is considered</v>
<v Speaker 8>extreme to say that gay marriage is a </v>

937
00:50:06.101 --> 00:50:08.660
<v Speaker 8>bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So extremism changes from,</v>

938
00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:10.300
<v Speaker 8>from year to year,</v>
<v Speaker 8>decade to decade,</v>

939
00:50:10.301 --> 00:50:11.134
<v Speaker 8>month to month.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And it should never be a criteria for </v>

940
00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:16.360
<v Speaker 8>your speed is an extreme or nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's not the right question.</v>

941
00:50:16.361 --> 00:50:17.710
<v Speaker 8>The question,</v>
<v Speaker 8>is it true or false?</v>

942
00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:20.800
<v Speaker 8>Is it right or wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Those are the questions to ask.</v>

943
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:22.260
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

944
00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:23.630
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really quickly,</v>

945
00:50:23.631 --> 00:50:25.460
<v Speaker 4>one final question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

946
00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:27.950
<v Speaker 4>part of the debate that we have,</v>

947
00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.113
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when we talk about free speech is in </v>

948
00:50:32.181 --> 00:50:35.780
<v Speaker 7>universities.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is is a university of public institution</v>

949
00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:37.670
<v Speaker 7>or is it an institution of higher </v>
<v Speaker 7>learning?</v>

950
00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:38.713
<v Speaker 7>No one would dispute that the manning </v>
<v Speaker 7>center is free to invite disinvite or </v>

951
00:50:42.981 --> 00:50:43.814
<v Speaker 7>not invite anyone that they want to come</v>
<v Speaker 7>to this conference to learn and to </v>

952
00:50:46.911 --> 00:50:47.744
<v Speaker 7>train.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But because universities are recipients </v>

953
00:50:50.181 --> 00:50:51.014
<v Speaker 7>of large amounts of tax dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 7>are they more of a public institution </v>

954
00:50:54.621 --> 00:50:58.910
<v Speaker 7>that is required to provide a bigger </v>
<v Speaker 7>forum for speech free speech?</v>

955
00:50:59.090 --> 00:50:59.923
<v Speaker 7>And where do you draw that line?</v>
<v Speaker 7>When organizations that receive large </v>

956
00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:04.003
<v Speaker 7>amounts of charitable tax benefits are </v>
<v Speaker 7>freer to disinvite or not invite or not </v>

957
00:51:09.201 --> 00:51:10.034
<v Speaker 7>host,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you don't have to give a platform to </v>

958
00:51:11.451 --> 00:51:13.010
<v Speaker 7>someone who speaks,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who disagree with,</v>

959
00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:14.143
<v Speaker 7>but when do you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when you're the recipient of public </v>

960
00:51:15.561 --> 00:51:16.800
<v Speaker 7>monies.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

961
00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:18.490
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think in the current context with,</v>

962
00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:19.353
<v Speaker 8>with the universities and receiving $13 </v>
<v Speaker 8>billion a year from taxpayers in that </v>

963
00:51:23.111 --> 00:51:23.944
<v Speaker 8>particular context,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think that they don't have the right </v>

964
00:51:28.001 --> 00:51:28.834
<v Speaker 8>to behave as say,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a private institution like Trinity </v>

965
00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:33.221
<v Speaker 8>Western University,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

966
00:51:33.221 --> 00:51:35.980
<v Speaker 8>which gets no government funding.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's very different.</v>

967
00:51:35.981 --> 00:51:37.940
<v Speaker 8>If Trinity Western University,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

968
00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:41.290
<v Speaker 8>said we're going to ban the expression </v>
<v Speaker 8>of,</v>

969
00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:42.153
<v Speaker 8>of um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>atheism or Islam on campus and see </v>

970
00:51:44.921 --> 00:51:47.710
<v Speaker 8>what's private institution as long as </v>
<v Speaker 8>they're up front about that,</v>

971
00:51:47.830 --> 00:51:49.420
<v Speaker 8>that when you go there,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know that,</v>

972
00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:50.433
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>pro Islamic or pro atheist speech is </v>

973
00:51:52.091 --> 00:51:55.390
<v Speaker 8>outlawed and you still choose to go to </v>
<v Speaker 8>that university.</v>

974
00:51:55.590 --> 00:51:57.130
<v Speaker 8>But ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

975
00:51:57.131 --> 00:51:59.050
<v Speaker 8>what I've heard from people,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

976
00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:00.153
<v Speaker 8>currently and in the past that are </v>
<v Speaker 8>attending trinity is they do have </v>

977
00:52:01.721 --> 00:52:03.670
<v Speaker 8>Muslims and atheists and gay people </v>
<v Speaker 8>there.</v>

978
00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:07.510
<v Speaker 8>And it is a healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 8>vigorous intellectual climate.</v>

979
00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:10.060
<v Speaker 8>But in response to the question,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if,</v>

980
00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:13.240
<v Speaker 8>if you're a private institution,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you can invite or not invite,</v>

981
00:52:13.241 --> 00:52:15.220
<v Speaker 8>you can do whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

982
00:52:15.221 --> 00:52:16.054
<v Speaker 8>but for the university is because </v>
<v Speaker 8>they're holding themselves out as </v>

983
00:52:19.271 --> 00:52:23.590
<v Speaker 8>supposedly in favor of academic inquiry </v>
<v Speaker 8>and free expression.</v>

984
00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:26.480
<v Speaker 8>They should be required to honor that </v>
<v Speaker 8>commitment that they've made to,</v>

985
00:52:26.481 --> 00:52:27.550
<v Speaker 8>to taxpayers.</v>
