1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.020
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the last time,</v>

2
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.433
<v Speaker 1>so the last time we talked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to you about how the knowledge </v>

3
00:00:17.611 --> 00:00:18.444
<v Speaker 1>structures that we inhabit might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>built from the bottom up and so I'm </v>

4
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.040
<v Speaker 1>showing you this diagram because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>might help clarify that a little bit,</v>

5
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.143
<v Speaker 1>so what you see at the top of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy partially built hierarchy and </v>

6
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:33.414
<v Speaker 1>so one way of thinking of an attribute </v>
<v Speaker 1>like good when you apply it to a person </v>

7
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:39.144
<v Speaker 1>or bad or evil or or wonderful or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever is to think about it as a </v>

8
00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:44.940
<v Speaker 1>description of an object,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not really.</v>

9
00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:45.774
<v Speaker 1>It's a shorthand for a set of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While I think of them as micro </v>

10
00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:50.904
<v Speaker 1>personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could also think about them as </v>

11
00:00:52.171 --> 00:00:56.910
<v Speaker 1>behavioral patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now one of the things I mentioned to you</v>

12
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.090
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to you a little bit about words</v>

13
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.373
<v Speaker 1>at one point and what words signify and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a very complicated problem and </v>

14
00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:06.594
<v Speaker 1>so most of you are probably Augustinians</v>
<v Speaker 1>without really knowing it because St </v>

15
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Augustine originally proposed that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>word was a label for a thing.</v>

16
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.950
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's how people </v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally think.</v>

17
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:17.784
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure most of you would regard that </v>

18
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:23.730
<v Speaker 1>definition as perfectly suitable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

19
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.850
<v Speaker 1>It's by no means the only definition and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's by no means necessarily the correct</v>

20
00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:29.724
<v Speaker 1>definition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a famous philosopher named </v>

21
00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:32.754
<v Speaker 1>Viv Goldstein who proposed instead that </v>
<v Speaker 1>a word was like a piece in a chess game </v>

22
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.250
<v Speaker 1>which meant that it was something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

23
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.173
<v Speaker 1>It was something that you did something </v>
<v Speaker 1>with or you might think about it </v>

24
00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:45.900
<v Speaker 1>actually as a tool and when you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how you use words,</v>

25
00:01:45.901 --> 00:01:46.734
<v Speaker 1>then you can see that you're using them </v>
<v Speaker 1>often as tools to interact with other </v>

26
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:53.130
<v Speaker 1>people so that for a purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

27
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.650
<v Speaker 1>The words have a purpose and so the word</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a tool.</v>

28
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.490
<v Speaker 1>And what I like about the tool idea that</v>
<v Speaker 1>dual ideas,</v>

29
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.343
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very evolutionarily sophisticated </v>

30
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.243
<v Speaker 1>concept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because we're tool using </v>

31
00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:07.944
<v Speaker 1>creatures probably beyond our other </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacities except for possibly </v>

32
00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:13.480
<v Speaker 1>invitation and language set.</v>

33
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.350
<v Speaker 1>A set is so far apart from other </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

34
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:17.723
<v Speaker 1>but the thing about a tool is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between dual in an object as </v>

35
00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:24.840
<v Speaker 1>an object doesn't have a user.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word object doesn't imply user,</v>

36
00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:25.674
<v Speaker 1>but the word tool implies user and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not obvious that we ever interact with </v>

37
00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:30.954
<v Speaker 1>anything in the world without </v>
<v Speaker 1>interacting with it in some motivated </v>

38
00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:33.954
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what we're doing is using words </v>

39
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:40.200
<v Speaker 1>to get through the world to interact </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly within the world and to move to</v>

40
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:42.180
<v Speaker 1>where we want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

41
00:02:42.181 --> 00:02:43.014
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's the second way of thinking </v>

42
00:02:43.771 --> 00:02:44.604
<v Speaker 1>about where it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's another way of thinking about a </v>

43
00:02:45.451 --> 00:02:46.284
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A word is like a box of things and so </v>

44
00:02:50.161 --> 00:02:50.994
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've cleaned out your basement and </v>

45
00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:54.930
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of boxes downstairs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:55.764
<v Speaker 1>one box is labeled books while inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>that box there can be any manner of </v>

47
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>books.</v>

48
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:01.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>books is a very,</v>

49
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:03.770
<v Speaker 1>very diverse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

50
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 1>very diverse set of phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're moving,</v>

51
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.210
<v Speaker 1>books are kind of condensed into one </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

52
00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 1>which is heavy objects that are made out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of paper.</v>

53
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.983
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can also imagine another box </v>

54
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:20.680
<v Speaker 1>that says things and in the thing box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you have a thing drawer at home</v>

55
00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:22.930
<v Speaker 1>where you put all the things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know what to do.</v>

56
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:23.950
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's like,</v>

57
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.843
<v Speaker 1>it's like the category of old things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't know what to do with </v>

58
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.630
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

59
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:33.631
<v Speaker 1>So a word can also represent a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively heterogenic heterogeneous set</v>

60
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.020
<v Speaker 1>of tools or entities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's very much,</v>

61
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.040
<v Speaker 1>that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

62
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:39.874
<v Speaker 1>very useful to know because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that happens often when people </v>

63
00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 1>are arguing is that they use the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>

64
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:48.580
<v Speaker 1>but each word contains a set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different objects,</v>

65
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.270
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

66
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.980
<v Speaker 1>So you might say for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

67
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.320
<v Speaker 1>is fear real questions like that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>very strange.</v>

68
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.980
<v Speaker 1>They're not really answerable in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense because it depends on exactly what</v>

69
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:00.814
<v Speaker 1>you mean by fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because fear can contain a lot of </v>

70
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:03.663
<v Speaker 1>heterogeneous entities roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it also means it also depends </v>

71
00:04:07.721 --> 00:04:08.554
<v Speaker 1>on what you mean by real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can define fear and you can </v>

72
00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:14.080
<v Speaker 1>define real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that fear is a subcategory of real.</v>

73
00:04:14.081 --> 00:04:16.180
<v Speaker 1>Or you can define fear and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>define real.</v>

74
00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:19.300
<v Speaker 1>So that fear isn't a subset of real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

75
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.403
<v Speaker 1>so like the idea that fear is a box that</v>
<v Speaker 1>only contains a certain set of entities </v>

76
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.260
<v Speaker 1>or a certain set of tools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that reality is the same as wrong,</v>

77
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.730
<v Speaker 1>and people argue about those sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things all the time and you know,</v>

78
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.680
<v Speaker 1>they make these binary questions like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is x a y?</v>

79
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.543
<v Speaker 1>Well x and y are generally not well </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough defined so that you can easily </v>

80
00:04:40.691 --> 00:04:43.030
<v Speaker 1>come up with an answer to a binary </v>
<v Speaker 1>question like that.</v>

81
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.210
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So words can also represent a relatively</v>

82
00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:49.840
<v Speaker 1>heterogeneous set of attributes or </v>
<v Speaker 1>objects or tools.</v>

83
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.210
<v Speaker 1>When you say that someone's a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

84
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:53.793
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't mean that they're a good </v>

85
00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:56.044
<v Speaker 1>person all the time or that everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've ever done in their entire life </v>

86
00:05:00.131 --> 00:05:00.964
<v Speaker 1>is good because they wouldn't be a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>person and they'd be a saint or some </v>

87
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.350
<v Speaker 1>other fictional character like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're applying the label,</v>

88
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.720
<v Speaker 1>we're calling label for the purposes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this argument.</v>

89
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.240
<v Speaker 1>It's a descriptive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's descriptive tool.</v>

90
00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:14.660
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're applying a,</v>

91
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.690
<v Speaker 1>a term like that to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a shorthand for a variety of states</v>

92
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.553
<v Speaker 1>that this person could exist in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>majority of which you would regard as </v>

93
00:05:23.741 --> 00:05:24.790
<v Speaker 1>positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

94
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.980
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well he's a better person than she is.</v>

95
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.300
<v Speaker 1>And then you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

96
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:31.480
<v Speaker 1>the proportion of attributes that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>has,</v>

97
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.213
<v Speaker 1>I think I said she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it exceeds the proportion of </v>

98
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.930
<v Speaker 1>positive attributes that this other </v>
<v Speaker 1>person has.</v>

99
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.153
<v Speaker 1>So the other way that you can think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a word is Mrs. More complicated </v>

100
00:05:41.861 --> 00:05:43.420
<v Speaker 1>and involve a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>visualization.</v>

101
00:05:43.421 --> 00:05:46.900
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that you have a child's train</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a track.</v>

102
00:05:46.901 --> 00:05:47.734
<v Speaker 1>It's going round and round the track and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got cars on it that you can put </v>

103
00:05:50.501 --> 00:05:52.600
<v Speaker 1>things in and all the cars are full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

104
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.950
<v Speaker 1>And then on the track there's a box with</v>
<v Speaker 1>cutouts.</v>

105
00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:56.803
<v Speaker 1>Say That so that the train can pass </v>
<v Speaker 1>through and on top of the blocks is a </v>

106
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:04.550
<v Speaker 1>word and the word is things and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>train is going through the box.</v>

107
00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:05.384
<v Speaker 1>And in some sense what that would mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine the train was long enough is </v>

108
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:08.954
<v Speaker 1>that at any given second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the box of things would contain </v>

109
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:13.940
<v Speaker 1>different things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would still be a box of things.</v>

110
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.070
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of words we use are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only are they do,</v>

111
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:22.010
<v Speaker 1>they represent a heterogeneous set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>entities,</v>

112
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.030
<v Speaker 1>but the set changes depending on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>context that we use the word yet,</v>

113
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.133
<v Speaker 1>so all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the reason I'm telling you that is </v>

114
00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:30.704
<v Speaker 1>because a word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's another way of thinking about a </v>

115
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:33.344
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>

116
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.190
<v Speaker 1>This will be good for you computer while</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're all computer people.</v>

117
00:06:37.191 --> 00:06:41.570
<v Speaker 1>Now of course</v>
<v Speaker 1>a word is a low resolution image,</v>

118
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:44.543
<v Speaker 1>so you know what you think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm worried isn't good enough </v>

119
00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:50.670
<v Speaker 1>approximation of the thing that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>representing.</v>

120
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:51.533
<v Speaker 1>Sort of like a thumbnail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now obviously one of the differences </v>

121
00:06:54.181 --> 00:06:55.014
<v Speaker 1>between the thumbnail and the real thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the real thing exists at a much </v>

122
00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:59.453
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a much higher level of resolution that </v>

123
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.720
<v Speaker 1>exists at many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many more layers,</v>

124
00:07:03.721 --> 00:07:04.554
<v Speaker 1>but you can use the thumbnail to </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent it and the advantage to doing </v>

125
00:07:07.231 --> 00:07:08.064
<v Speaker 1>that is that it doesn't take up much </v>
<v Speaker 1>processing time and it doesn't take up </v>

126
00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:12.564
<v Speaker 1>much memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So lots of times you want to use the </v>

127
00:07:14.281 --> 00:07:17.640
<v Speaker 1>shorthand for the thing rather than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing because it's just too complicated.</v>

128
00:07:17.641 --> 00:07:19.770
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise and often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you might say,</v>

129
00:07:19.771 --> 00:07:20.604
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know that your shorthand </v>

130
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.883
<v Speaker 1>representation is a good representation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the thing that you're trying to </v>

131
00:07:26.311 --> 00:07:28.590
<v Speaker 1>represent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the pragmatist would say,</v>

132
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.080
<v Speaker 1>well it depends on what you want to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

133
00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.273
<v Speaker 1>That that's the tool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like aspect say it's like if you're </v>

134
00:07:34.471 --> 00:07:38.670
<v Speaker 1>using word x to represent potentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>heterogeneous class,</v>

135
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.920
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you use it,</v>

136
00:07:40.921 --> 00:07:43.860
<v Speaker 1>you get to where you want or you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>close enough to where you want,</v>

137
00:07:43.861 --> 00:07:47.610
<v Speaker 1>then it's good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like it's how you know a joke is</v>

138
00:07:47.611 --> 00:07:49.590
<v Speaker 1>good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well someone labs,</v>

139
00:07:49.591 --> 00:07:52.380
<v Speaker 1>it's like okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the joke is good enough and so.</v>

140
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:53.933
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that's quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about the way that you </v>

141
00:07:55.831 --> 00:07:56.664
<v Speaker 1>interact with the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something that pragmatists </v>

142
00:07:58.531 --> 00:07:59.364
<v Speaker 1>really discovered in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that you're always aiming out some </v>

143
00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:06.780
<v Speaker 1>bounded set of events that's somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>different from the current set of events</v>

144
00:08:06.781 --> 00:08:07.614
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise you could just sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and then you put your conceptions </v>

145
00:08:10.891 --> 00:08:13.980
<v Speaker 1>to work and your actions to work to </v>
<v Speaker 1>manage the transformation.</v>

146
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.670
<v Speaker 1>And if you manage the transformation </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's good enough.</v>

147
00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:18.923
<v Speaker 1>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to go any farther than </v>

148
00:08:20.341 --> 00:08:21.174
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that explains partly how you can </v>

149
00:08:24.211 --> 00:08:26.340
<v Speaker 1>maneuver in the world with limited </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge,</v>

150
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.513
<v Speaker 1>use low resolution representations to </v>
<v Speaker 1>partially hit vague goals and that </v>

151
00:08:33.151 --> 00:08:34.630
<v Speaker 1>generally gets you there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

152
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.520
<v Speaker 1>that process was called satisficing by </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

153
00:08:38.521 --> 00:08:39.354
<v Speaker 1>What's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just extraordinarily famous economists </v>

154
00:08:41.901 --> 00:08:42.734
<v Speaker 1>and psychologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody remember who coined the word </v>

155
00:08:44.851 --> 00:08:47.100
<v Speaker 1>satisficing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Economists,</v>

156
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.090
<v Speaker 1>psychologists or assignment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

157
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:49.950
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but thank you.</v>

158
00:08:49.951 --> 00:08:51.480
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was herb assignment,</v>

159
00:08:51.481 --> 00:08:52.380
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>

160
00:08:52.381 --> 00:08:55.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're often not out to optimize,</v>

161
00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.480
<v Speaker 1>let's say in a search for a partner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

162
00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:58.373
<v Speaker 1>to optimize it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to search through several </v>

163
00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:00.740
<v Speaker 1>billion people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

164
00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.480
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to do that because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have the time.</v>

165
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.460
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

166
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.240
<v Speaker 1>you don't know exactly how you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's something like this.</v>

167
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:10.733
<v Speaker 1>You have five attributes that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for and maybe to that you don't </v>

168
00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:14.910
<v Speaker 1>know you're looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you are looking for.</v>

169
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.840
<v Speaker 1>And the first person that comes along </v>
<v Speaker 1>that matches those well enough you pick.</v>

170
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:23.100
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not an optimization issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

171
00:09:23.101 --> 00:09:24.990
<v Speaker 1>given that you have a limited amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

172
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.330
<v Speaker 1>you can't wait around for optimized </v>
<v Speaker 1>solutions,</v>

173
00:09:27.331 --> 00:09:32.331
<v Speaker 1>you have to go ahead with sufficient and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then move to the next issue.</v>

174
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:38.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all that's a conceptual precursor for</v>

175
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:40.853
<v Speaker 1>taking a look at this diagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're calling someone a good person </v>

176
00:09:43.171 --> 00:09:45.870
<v Speaker 1>and so what does it mean while we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do a bit of a micro analysis,</v>

177
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:47.123
<v Speaker 1>we'll assume that it's a shorthand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low resolution representation of the </v>

178
00:09:49.771 --> 00:09:50.604
<v Speaker 1>person and that you can decompose it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if someone says x is that Henry is a </v>

179
00:09:55.591 --> 00:09:58.260
<v Speaker 1>good person and maybe he's 45,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might say,</v>

180
00:09:58.261 --> 00:10:00.120
<v Speaker 1>does he have children?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you say yes,</v>

181
00:10:00.121 --> 00:10:00.954
<v Speaker 1>and then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well he is he a good parent because you </v>

182
00:10:02.611 --> 00:10:05.190
<v Speaker 1>might assume that if he's a good person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would be a good parent.</v>

183
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.890
<v Speaker 1>Now it's conceivable that he could be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good parent,</v>

184
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:09.690
<v Speaker 1>a good person without being a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>parent.</v>

185
00:10:09.691 --> 00:10:12.060
<v Speaker 1>If he was good at like five other report</v>
<v Speaker 1>and things.</v>

186
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:16.020
<v Speaker 1>But let's assume that as a good person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's also a good parent.</v>

187
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.273
<v Speaker 1>I think it's reasonable to assume that </v>
<v Speaker 1>good parent would be a subset of good </v>

188
00:10:20.131 --> 00:10:21.120
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

189
00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:21.954
<v Speaker 1>Because it's more specific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more specific means it covers less time </v>

190
00:10:25.801 --> 00:10:30.630
<v Speaker 1>and space in some sense because good </v>
<v Speaker 1>person is a description of a person that</v>

191
00:10:30.631 --> 00:10:31.464
<v Speaker 1>covers how the person interacts with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world across the broadest possible </v>

192
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.370
<v Speaker 1>amount of time and location and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>good parents as well.</v>

193
00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:39.563
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You find that out when they're </v>

194
00:10:40.111 --> 00:10:42.840
<v Speaker 1>interacting with children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say for the sake of argument,</v>

195
00:10:42.841 --> 00:10:44.790
<v Speaker 1>there's other issues and then you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

196
00:10:44.791 --> 00:10:46.320
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he's good parent,</v>

197
00:10:46.321 --> 00:10:47.154
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is he?</v>

198
00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.320
<v Speaker 1>What does he have to do to be a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>parent?</v>

199
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.071
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

200
00:10:50.071 --> 00:10:50.904
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to feed his children so he probably </v>

201
00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:54.570
<v Speaker 1>needs a job and it would be better if it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a good job.</v>

202
00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:57.330
<v Speaker 1>So he's got a good job and that's part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of being a good person.</v>

203
00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:58.523
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe he can care for his </v>

204
00:10:59.881 --> 00:11:00.714
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so care might be regarded as a more </v>

205
00:11:05.341 --> 00:11:09.660
<v Speaker 1>specific subset of good parent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can decompose care into,</v>

206
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:13.050
<v Speaker 1>let's say play with baby and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can decompose,</v>

207
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.860
<v Speaker 1>play into while I decomposed it into </v>
<v Speaker 1>peak tickle and clean.</v>

208
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.790
<v Speaker 1>And then what's interesting about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that those are all abstractions,</v>

209
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.120
<v Speaker 1>but once you get down to a high enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>level of resolution,</v>

210
00:11:24.121 --> 00:11:24.954
<v Speaker 1>they're no longer abstractions in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are actually options that you </v>

211
00:11:27.361 --> 00:11:30.420
<v Speaker 1>undertake in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moving your hand is not an abstraction.</v>

212
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:32.003
<v Speaker 1>So at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a nice elegant solution to </v>

213
00:11:34.291 --> 00:11:38.160
<v Speaker 1>the mind body problem to some degree at </v>
<v Speaker 1>some level of resolution,</v>

214
00:11:38.161 --> 00:11:38.994
<v Speaker 1>high resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it stops being conceptual and starts </v>

215
00:11:41.251 --> 00:11:44.160
<v Speaker 1>being action and that's where the mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>hits the world.</v>

216
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.233
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go into an even higher level of </v>

217
00:11:47.161 --> 00:11:47.994
<v Speaker 1>resolution than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what do you have to do in order to </v>

218
00:11:50.191 --> 00:11:53.190
<v Speaker 1>move your hand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer to that is you don't know.</v>

219
00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.740
<v Speaker 1>You just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so your consciousness bottoms out in</v>

220
00:11:56.741 --> 00:11:59.260
<v Speaker 1>some sense at the level of voluntary </v>
<v Speaker 1>motor activity.</v>

221
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:00.483
<v Speaker 1>So there's a level above which you </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot perceive which are the networks </v>

222
00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:05.014
<v Speaker 1>that you're involved in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a level below which you </v>

223
00:12:07.331 --> 00:12:11.170
<v Speaker 1>can't perceive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is under normal circumstances,</v>

224
00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.053
<v Speaker 1>perceive our control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is whatever it enables you to </v>

225
00:12:13.871 --> 00:12:16.090
<v Speaker 1>actually move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all right,</v>

226
00:12:16.091 --> 00:12:20.050
<v Speaker 1>so then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what are all of these things?</v>

227
00:12:20.051 --> 00:12:24.100
<v Speaker 1>These like how would you conceptualize?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I decomposed good person,</v>

228
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:25.263
<v Speaker 1>but then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what are all these things made out </v>

229
00:12:26.891 --> 00:12:27.960
<v Speaker 1>of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a sense,</v>

230
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.160
<v Speaker 1>what are their constituent elements?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good person,</v>

231
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:32.770
<v Speaker 1>good parent family care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>play with baby.</v>

232
00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:35.290
<v Speaker 1>They're sort of like games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're sort of like stories.</v>

233
00:12:35.291 --> 00:12:38.980
<v Speaker 1>They're sort of like rituals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about them in these terms.</v>

234
00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:39.903
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where we get to this particular </v>

235
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.193
<v Speaker 1>diagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we're going to concentrate on </v>

236
00:12:45.011 --> 00:12:49.060
<v Speaker 1>quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me shift to it and then we'll,</v>

237
00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:50.440
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk about that.</v>

238
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:25.280
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't exactly know how to.</v>

239
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:26.263
<v Speaker 1>What to call this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the best way of thinking about </v>

240
00:13:30.291 --> 00:13:31.124
<v Speaker 1>it is that it's a subpersonality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the reason I call it a sub </v>

241
00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.753
<v Speaker 1>personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because only a personality has all the </v>

242
00:13:37.431 --> 00:13:40.490
<v Speaker 1>attributes that this thing has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the attributes are.</v>

243
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:41.623
<v Speaker 1>It's something I talked to you last week</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the fact that the Russian </v>

244
00:13:43.641 --> 00:13:45.170
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

245
00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:50.090
<v Speaker 1>felt that people had to build models of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and and so you could call this</v>

246
00:13:50.091 --> 00:13:50.924
<v Speaker 1>a model of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but and so the reason they suspected </v>

247
00:13:54.741 --> 00:13:57.180
<v Speaker 1>that was because if you brought someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

248
00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.273
<v Speaker 1>I think I ran through this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you bring someone into a laboratory </v>

249
00:13:59.901 --> 00:14:00.734
<v Speaker 1>and you play them a tone when they first</v>
<v Speaker 1>hear the tone and they manifest and </v>

250
00:14:03.561 --> 00:14:05.290
<v Speaker 1>orienting reflex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a change,</v>

251
00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:06.223
<v Speaker 1>a change in skin conductance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's actually a consequence of </v>

252
00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:11.780
<v Speaker 1>neurological activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then if you play the tone of bunch,</v>

253
00:14:11.781 --> 00:14:12.614
<v Speaker 1>they stop having that reaction and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you vary the tone on any perceptible </v>

254
00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:22.100
<v Speaker 1>dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the orienting reflex returns,</v>

255
00:14:22.101 --> 00:14:22.934
<v Speaker 1>and so the inference from that was all </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously the the person must be </v>

256
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:29.383
<v Speaker 1>constructing a model of the tone because</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise how would they know if </v>

257
00:14:32.931 --> 00:14:34.130
<v Speaker 1>something deviated from it?</v>

258
00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:36.380
<v Speaker 1>Especially on all those dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So not only is it,</v>

259
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:40.160
<v Speaker 1>not only is it a model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a multidimensional model.</v>

260
00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:41.930
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

261
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:43.183
<v Speaker 1>the upshot of that was that for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time people tried to figure out how in </v>

262
00:14:45.891 --> 00:14:46.724
<v Speaker 1>the world we modeled the world and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they also tried to make smart machines </v>

263
00:14:49.671 --> 00:14:50.504
<v Speaker 1>that modeled the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could then plan their actions in </v>

264
00:14:53.181 --> 00:14:54.014
<v Speaker 1>the world and then could act in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world as a consequence and they got </v>

265
00:14:56.811 --> 00:14:57.644
<v Speaker 1>nowhere with that because it turned out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the world is so damn complex that </v>

266
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:01.783
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to model it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to spend all your time </v>

267
00:15:03.711 --> 00:15:05.530
<v Speaker 1>modeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to spend anytime acting</v>

268
00:15:05.531 --> 00:15:06.364
<v Speaker 1>in and you're not going to get anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's partly because the world is </v>

269
00:15:09.081 --> 00:15:09.914
<v Speaker 1>almost infinitely complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're trying to get a </v>

270
00:15:12.231 --> 00:15:13.880
<v Speaker 1>computer to look at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

271
00:15:13.881 --> 00:15:14.714
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the computer supposed to look </v>

272
00:15:16.521 --> 00:15:17.354
<v Speaker 1>at?</v>

273
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.400
<v Speaker 1>Everything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

274
00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:20.323
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you look at a lot in some ways </v>

275
00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:27.560
<v Speaker 1>and not very much in others and half </v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain is dedicated roughly speaking</v>

276
00:15:27.561 --> 00:15:29.000
<v Speaker 1>to visual process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

277
00:15:29.001 --> 00:15:31.790
<v Speaker 1>and then you've got your other senses to</v>
<v Speaker 1>help you figure out what's going on.</v>

278
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.190
<v Speaker 1>But you don't build a model of the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

279
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.233
<v Speaker 1>You don't build any model alone at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the parts of the world that aren't </v>

280
00:15:37.101 --> 00:15:39.170
<v Speaker 1>relevant to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

281
00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:42.530
<v Speaker 1>you're a model of this floor is very low</v>
<v Speaker 1>resolution.</v>

282
00:15:42.531 --> 00:15:43.364
<v Speaker 1>If I took you guys out in the hallway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming the hallway floor isn't the </v>

283
00:15:46.431 --> 00:15:47.750
<v Speaker 1>same color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>

284
00:15:47.751 --> 00:15:50.630
<v Speaker 1>what was the color of this floor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would not be able to tell me.</v>

285
00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:51.883
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be shifting color all the time </v>

286
00:15:54.501 --> 00:15:55.820
<v Speaker 1>while you're sitting here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

287
00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:58.010
<v Speaker 1>suddenly and you're not going to care.</v>

288
00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:01.040
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>falling through it and it isn't moving.</v>

289
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:04.310
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like an invisible </v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition of your,</v>

290
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.640
<v Speaker 1>of your current knowledge structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's all sorts of things going on</v>

291
00:16:07.641 --> 00:16:08.690
<v Speaker 1>around you that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

292
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:09.673
<v Speaker 1>You don't pay attention to the walls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really don't pay attention to the </v>

293
00:16:12.231 --> 00:16:13.880
<v Speaker 1>people that are around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

294
00:16:13.881 --> 00:16:15.890
<v Speaker 1>they could start themselves in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different way.</v>

295
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.170
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't notice unless you know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

296
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:19.333
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of things that you </v>

297
00:16:20.691 --> 00:16:21.524
<v Speaker 1>don't model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you've all seen the invisible </v>

298
00:16:23.721 --> 00:16:26.420
<v Speaker 1>gorilla video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I presume everyone seen that hasn't?</v>

299
00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:27.283
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there anyone here who hasn't seen </v>

300
00:16:28.161 --> 00:16:30.560
<v Speaker 1>that video?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

301
00:16:30.561 --> 00:16:31.910
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's something a.</v>

302
00:16:31.911 --> 00:16:32.744
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's really something that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this psychology experiment </v>

303
00:16:34.371 --> 00:16:35.204
<v Speaker 1>that's so well known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can talk to a crowd now and almost </v>

304
00:16:36.891 --> 00:16:39.020
<v Speaker 1>everyone's seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so shocking.</v>

305
00:16:39.021 --> 00:16:39.854
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course I would see a gorilla if one </v>

306
00:16:41.271 --> 00:16:43.280
<v Speaker 1>was dancing around on the basketball </v>
<v Speaker 1>court.</v>

307
00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:44.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

308
00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:45.051
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't.</v>

309
00:16:45.051 --> 00:16:46.910
<v Speaker 1>Or there's a 50 percent chance you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't.</v>

310
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.133
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason for that is fundamentally </v>

311
00:16:50.061 --> 00:16:50.894
<v Speaker 1>speaking is that your given a task when </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you watch that video and the task </v>

312
00:16:56.061 --> 00:16:56.894
<v Speaker 1>is to count the number of times the ball</v>
<v Speaker 1>was thrown by the team in black and so </v>

313
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:02.743
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden your perceptual systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>reorient themselves and you're actually </v>

314
00:17:05.601 --> 00:17:06.434
<v Speaker 1>not really looking at people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at something that might </v>

315
00:17:08.691 --> 00:17:09.524
<v Speaker 1>be like animated stick figures who are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are engaged momentarily and moving </v>

316
00:17:14.271 --> 00:17:19.271
<v Speaker 1>the object of of perceptual importance </v>
<v Speaker 1>around and so you can blur them out,</v>

317
00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:21.253
<v Speaker 1>which you do because obviously you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell the difference between a gorilla </v>

318
00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:28.490
<v Speaker 1>and the person dressed in black and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason you can't is you don't need to in</v>

319
00:17:28.491 --> 00:17:29.324
<v Speaker 1>order to fulfill the task.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can treat all the people like </v>

320
00:17:32.181 --> 00:17:33.014
<v Speaker 1>vaguely moving black objects and as long</v>
<v Speaker 1>as that doesn't interfere with your </v>

321
00:17:36.861 --> 00:17:40.070
<v Speaker 1>counting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's irrelevant and so actually you</v>

322
00:17:40.071 --> 00:17:40.904
<v Speaker 1>don't build a model of the whole world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you build a model of only the parts </v>

323
00:17:45.171 --> 00:17:48.560
<v Speaker 1>of the world that are irrelevant to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>ongoing microaction.</v>

324
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem that brings up is how do</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what's relevant and.</v>

325
00:17:52.951 --> 00:17:53.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a much.</v>

326
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:58.500
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough question and I would say </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason that you know what's relevant</v>

327
00:17:58.501 --> 00:17:59.334
<v Speaker 1>is because some things don't change over</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and you've been evolving through </v>

328
00:18:03.571 --> 00:18:07.860
<v Speaker 1>three and a half billion years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've built yourself.</v>

329
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.903
<v Speaker 1>If we go back to that other diagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you imagine the levels there from the </v>

330
00:18:12.001 --> 00:18:16.890
<v Speaker 1>micro activities to the abstractions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think about how much building had to</v>

331
00:18:16.891 --> 00:18:19.410
<v Speaker 1>go in before you can undertake those </v>
<v Speaker 1>micro actions,</v>

332
00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:22.770
<v Speaker 1>so like here you can move your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's great.</v>

333
00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:25.260
<v Speaker 1>How do you get the hand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

334
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:28.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took a long time.</v>

335
00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:29.003
<v Speaker 1>It took almost all of the three and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>half billion years before he managed to </v>

336
00:18:32.311 --> 00:18:35.630
<v Speaker 1>come up with a hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even underneath the,</v>

337
00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:36.873
<v Speaker 1>the micro-actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this massive evolutionary </v>

338
00:18:39.691 --> 00:18:40.524
<v Speaker 1>history that's been built up partly as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of some of the unchanging </v>

339
00:18:44.461 --> 00:18:45.294
<v Speaker 1>features of the environment or at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>in consequence of some of the slower </v>

340
00:18:48.811 --> 00:18:49.644
<v Speaker 1>changing features of the environment </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has given you this incredibly </v>

341
00:18:52.711 --> 00:18:53.544
<v Speaker 1>complex body that's really good at doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>some things and not very good at doing </v>

342
00:18:56.341 --> 00:18:57.270
<v Speaker 1>other things at all.</v>

343
00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.420
<v Speaker 1>And so that's how you solve the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relevance problem.</v>

344
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.553
<v Speaker 1>And I actually think it's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most powerful arguments for the </v>

345
00:19:05.011 --> 00:19:05.844
<v Speaker 1>necessity of evolutionary theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this problem is so complex </v>

346
00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:10.643
<v Speaker 1>because it's not only do you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>adapt to the environment across time so </v>

347
00:19:13.141 --> 00:19:15.300
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to build a body that </v>
<v Speaker 1>adapts to the environment.</v>

348
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:16.493
<v Speaker 1>It's worse than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the train passing through the </v>

349
00:19:18.181 --> 00:19:20.700
<v Speaker 1>box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment's not stable,</v>

350
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:25.170
<v Speaker 1>it keeps shifting and turning and moving</v>
<v Speaker 1>and twisting and so not only do you have</v>

351
00:19:25.171 --> 00:19:26.004
<v Speaker 1>to adapt to the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to adapt flexibly to the </v>

352
00:19:28.561 --> 00:19:32.370
<v Speaker 1>environment while it transforms itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>at different levels of,</v>

353
00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:33.413
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what would you say at different </v>

354
00:19:35.731 --> 00:19:36.564
<v Speaker 1>levels of totality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because sometimes there's minor changes </v>

355
00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:40.344
<v Speaker 1>in the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you know a meteor hits the </v>

356
00:19:42.031 --> 00:19:42.864
<v Speaker 1>earth and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were plunged into darkness for four </v>

357
00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:46.560
<v Speaker 1>years or there's an ice age or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

358
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.393
<v Speaker 1>So the levels of transformation in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment can be radical and the </v>

359
00:19:51.091 --> 00:19:53.250
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary process has to keep up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

360
00:19:53.251 --> 00:19:57.060
<v Speaker 1>And the way it works apparently like I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't believe this is the whole story,</v>

361
00:19:57.061 --> 00:19:57.894
<v Speaker 1>although it's more or less the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>Darwinian story is that something more </v>

362
00:20:01.711 --> 00:20:02.544
<v Speaker 1>or less works and that makes a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>copies of itself and there's tiny </v>

363
00:20:05.611 --> 00:20:06.444
<v Speaker 1>variations in those copies often at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least in principle because of copying </v>

364
00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:12.300
<v Speaker 1>error,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is where I think the theories week</v>

365
00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:16.380
<v Speaker 1>and then they all die except like two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so why didn't those die?</v>

366
00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:17.490
<v Speaker 1>And their answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

367
00:20:17.491 --> 00:20:18.324
<v Speaker 1>they happened by chance to very in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction that the environment varied </v>

368
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:22.733
<v Speaker 1>and so they get to continue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the reason evolution works is </v>

369
00:20:25.411 --> 00:20:28.710
<v Speaker 1>because everything dies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything fails.</v>

370
00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:30.270
<v Speaker 1>So because he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

371
00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:33.210
<v Speaker 1>keeping up with a randomly changing </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment is impossible.</v>

372
00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.413
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how do you do it while you do a </v>

373
00:20:35.821 --> 00:20:36.600
<v Speaker 1>million things?</v>

374
00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.433
<v Speaker 1>Most of them don't work and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you only have to succeed enough to </v>

375
00:20:40.741 --> 00:20:41.574
<v Speaker 1>propagate yourself once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now I think that that's not exactly </v>

376
00:20:46.321 --> 00:20:50.320
<v Speaker 1>right because I don't believe that our </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of evolution is complete.</v>

377
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.333
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of reasons I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that one is DNA is pretty damn </v>

378
00:20:54.971 --> 00:20:55.804
<v Speaker 1>complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not obvious how it could have </v>

379
00:20:56.771 --> 00:20:59.920
<v Speaker 1>evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even the people who discovered DNA,</v>

380
00:20:59.921 --> 00:21:00.754
<v Speaker 1>we're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very perplexed by the fact that it </v>

381
00:21:02.021 --> 00:21:03.610
<v Speaker 1>existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of them,</v>

382
00:21:03.611 --> 00:21:04.444
<v Speaker 1>and I told you this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought that it came from outer space </v>

383
00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:08.200
<v Speaker 1>and it involved somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

384
00:21:08.201 --> 00:21:09.034
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think about that as a crazy </v>

385
00:21:10.361 --> 00:21:14.350
<v Speaker 1>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm cosmic winds,</v>

386
00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:17.380
<v Speaker 1>solar winds and that sort of thing can </v>
<v Speaker 1>propel tiny things.</v>

387
00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Vast distances rep relatively rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And over 13 point 5 billion years,</v>

388
00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:26.380
<v Speaker 1>you can really get around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the estimates if even if you use</v>

389
00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:27.243
<v Speaker 1>sub,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you use transportation methods that </v>

390
00:21:30.221 --> 00:21:31.054
<v Speaker 1>are about the speed that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could call a nice the whole galaxy </v>

391
00:21:33.191 --> 00:21:34.024
<v Speaker 1>and some like 20 million years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that because it's </v>

392
00:21:35.681 --> 00:21:36.514
<v Speaker 1>exponential.</v>

393
00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:37.623
<v Speaker 1>So 20 million years is a tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny subset of three point 5 billion </v>

394
00:21:41.201 --> 00:21:43.750
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not as far fetched as it sounds.</v>

395
00:21:43.751 --> 00:21:46.000
<v Speaker 1>The problem is it doesn't address the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem which is yeah.</v>

396
00:21:46.001 --> 00:21:47.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It came from somewhere else.</v>

397
00:21:47.351 --> 00:21:48.760
<v Speaker 1>But how did they get there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

398
00:21:48.761 --> 00:21:51.820
<v Speaker 1>It just pushes the problem back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's this other issue too,</v>

399
00:21:51.821 --> 00:21:54.760
<v Speaker 1>which is called MPG genesis Epi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>genesis,</v>

400
00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:55.863
<v Speaker 1>and that's really put old spoke in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific wheels in the last 20 years </v>

401
00:21:58.841 --> 00:21:59.674
<v Speaker 1>because the theory was 20 years ago that</v>
<v Speaker 1>all evolution proceeded through random </v>

402
00:22:05.081 --> 00:22:07.660
<v Speaker 1>mutation and it was random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

403
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:10.700
<v Speaker 1>But it turns out that's not exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>right because there are,</v>

404
00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:14.590
<v Speaker 1>there have been a number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrations that if something happens</v>

405
00:22:14.591 --> 00:22:15.424
<v Speaker 1>to generation a that will produce a </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation in the genetic </v>

406
00:22:18.911 --> 00:22:23.110
<v Speaker 1>information that's transferred to to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a generation b.</v>

407
00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:28.060
<v Speaker 1>and the transformation often seems not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not merely a consequence of damage,</v>

408
00:22:28.061 --> 00:22:31.540
<v Speaker 1>but actually a form of adaptation to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>new environment.</v>

409
00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.950
<v Speaker 1>So now that's a tough one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

410
00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.033
<v Speaker 1>because when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years ago when I was studying </v>

411
00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:40.240
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary psychology and evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 1>biology,</v>

412
00:22:40.241 --> 00:22:41.074
<v Speaker 1>if someone would have said what you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can transmit acquired </v>

413
00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:45.723
<v Speaker 1>characteristics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would've been like a year over there </v>

414
00:22:47.201 --> 00:22:50.350
<v Speaker 1>with the creationists because that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was no goal,</v>

415
00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:53.260
<v Speaker 1>that was against the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it does happen.</v>

416
00:22:53.261 --> 00:22:54.094
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that EPA genesis happens at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all means that there's a lot of things </v>

417
00:22:57.191 --> 00:23:01.690
<v Speaker 1>about how DNA works that we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I actually think what's happening is</v>

418
00:23:01.691 --> 00:23:02.524
<v Speaker 1>that the DNA is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complex microcomputer and I don't </v>

419
00:23:07.031 --> 00:23:09.850
<v Speaker 1>know exactly how it operates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe it's a quantum computer.</v>

420
00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:11.043
<v Speaker 1>It's very complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember it's had three and a half </v>

421
00:23:12.401 --> 00:23:14.140
<v Speaker 1>billion years to figure out what's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

422
00:23:14.141 --> 00:23:16.720
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's pretty good at surviving.</v>

423
00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.460
<v Speaker 1>So you don't want to underestimate it.</v>

424
00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:23.460
<v Speaker 1>And the structures that builds at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>molecular level are so complex.</v>

425
00:23:23.921 --> 00:23:25.030
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

426
00:23:25.031 --> 00:23:25.864
<v Speaker 1>if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some great animations of those </v>

427
00:23:27.251 --> 00:23:29.230
<v Speaker 1>things going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a molecular level on the net.</v>

428
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:33.700
<v Speaker 1>They're so complex that you can't help </v>
<v Speaker 1>but think of the mess computational when</v>

429
00:23:33.701 --> 00:23:36.030
<v Speaker 1>you watch them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not random processes.</v>

430
00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:36.873
<v Speaker 1>Mad like I watched the little molecule </v>
<v Speaker 1>that checks for error in a DNA </v>

431
00:23:41.621 --> 00:23:42.454
<v Speaker 1>replication string.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it checks for in DNA replication </v>

432
00:23:46.881 --> 00:23:51.740
<v Speaker 1>string man out of how to figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 1>it does something like that without some</v>

433
00:23:51.741 --> 00:23:54.860
<v Speaker 1>form of computation strikes me as </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible anyways.</v>

434
00:23:54.861 --> 00:23:55.694
<v Speaker 1>I think what happens is that overtime </v>
<v Speaker 1>the DNA plays like it can manifest </v>

435
00:23:59.391 --> 00:24:03.440
<v Speaker 1>itself in many different forms and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>also capitalizes on mutation.</v>

436
00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:07.070
<v Speaker 1>I think that's how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know there's other,</v>

437
00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:12.500
<v Speaker 1>I'd say kind of weak evidence for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's only evidenced by analogy,</v>

438
00:24:12.501 --> 00:24:16.760
<v Speaker 1>but if I take one of you and I put you </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a radically new environment,</v>

439
00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.013
<v Speaker 1>new genes will turn on in your brain and</v>
<v Speaker 1>code for new proteins and so it's like </v>

440
00:24:21.351 --> 00:24:24.170
<v Speaker 1>you're sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in some sense there's a whole set of</v>

441
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.033
<v Speaker 1>potential use that are sitting there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that potential is actually </v>

442
00:24:28.521 --> 00:24:30.020
<v Speaker 1>locked in the genetic code.</v>

443
00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dependent on the information that's</v>

444
00:24:32.961 --> 00:24:35.540
<v Speaker 1>in the environment around it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not all in the code,</v>

445
00:24:35.541 --> 00:24:37.490
<v Speaker 1>but it's enough to get the process </v>
<v Speaker 1>started.</v>

446
00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:40.460
<v Speaker 1>So if I take you out of situation a and </v>
<v Speaker 1>put you in situation,</v>

447
00:24:40.461 --> 00:24:43.820
<v Speaker 1>be you build new brain structures at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>micro level,</v>

448
00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:46.620
<v Speaker 1>so you're actually a different person </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

449
00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.473
<v Speaker 1>that's a very interesting way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about the consequences of </v>

450
00:24:49.581 --> 00:24:51.590
<v Speaker 1>something like exposure in </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy.</v>

451
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:52.431
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

452
00:24:52.431 --> 00:24:55.310
<v Speaker 1>you're all timid and there's eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 things you're terrified of.</v>

453
00:24:55.311 --> 00:24:57.410
<v Speaker 1>And so you go out and you master one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

454
00:24:57.411 --> 00:24:59.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like Poof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain is not the same,</v>

455
00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:02.300
<v Speaker 1>so maybe now you're a little braver and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>

456
00:25:02.301 --> 00:25:05.030
<v Speaker 1>you go master another one in the bunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>more of you turns on.</v>

457
00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:09.590
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't know if when one thing turns</v>
<v Speaker 1>on something else,</v>

458
00:25:09.591 --> 00:25:10.820
<v Speaker 1>turns off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

459
00:25:10.821 --> 00:25:11.654
<v Speaker 1>if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean is that there's </v>

460
00:25:12.681 --> 00:25:15.110
<v Speaker 1>only so much of you that can be turned </v>
<v Speaker 1>on at any one time,</v>

461
00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:16.243
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe a lot more of you could be </v>

462
00:25:19.151 --> 00:25:22.810
<v Speaker 1>turned on then is turned on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>

463
00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:23.713
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like that because people who </v>

464
00:25:25.031 --> 00:25:27.580
<v Speaker 1>really challenged themselves across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>span of their life,</v>

465
00:25:27.581 --> 00:25:29.920
<v Speaker 1>they develop talents in multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>directions,</v>

466
00:25:29.921 --> 00:25:33.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can really be amazingly good at a</v>

467
00:25:33.311 --> 00:25:35.770
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous number of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

468
00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

469
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.083
<v Speaker 1>Sokolov and vinegar over the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spinnaker Nova showed that you modeled </v>

470
00:25:47.061 --> 00:25:49.010
<v Speaker 1>the world right down to the finest </v>
<v Speaker 1>detail.</v>

471
00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:53.660
<v Speaker 1>But then Dan Simon and his crew showed </v>
<v Speaker 1>that no,</v>

472
00:25:53.661 --> 00:25:54.494
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're so blind that you can't even </v>

473
00:25:55.911 --> 00:25:56.721
<v Speaker 1>believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

474
00:25:56.721 --> 00:25:59.780
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are not the same set of facts.</v>

475
00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:03.110
<v Speaker 1>So how do we reconcile that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

476
00:26:03.111 --> 00:26:06.380
<v Speaker 1>well here's one way of getting up a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a sense of it.</v>

477
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:09.680
<v Speaker 1>Look straight ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>

478
00:26:09.681 --> 00:26:13.730
<v Speaker 1>Now concentrate not on what you see in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle of your vision,</v>

479
00:26:13.731 --> 00:26:17.330
<v Speaker 1>but in this side's probably better if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at a person to do that.</v>

480
00:26:17.331 --> 00:26:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't really matter though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So look at straight ahead but,</v>

481
00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:22.820
<v Speaker 1>but pay attention to what you see in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>periphery.</v>

482
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:26.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can tell you what,</v>

483
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.930
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you'll see,</v>

484
00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.800
<v Speaker 1>because some of it's very difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 1>detect way out in the periphery.</v>

485
00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:34.040
<v Speaker 1>It's black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't tell that though,</v>

486
00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:37.790
<v Speaker 1>but we know that because if we change </v>
<v Speaker 1>colors way out in the periphery on you,</v>

487
00:26:37.791 --> 00:26:41.060
<v Speaker 1>you can't detect the change and then out</v>
<v Speaker 1>to about here,</v>

488
00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 1>if something isn't moving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost impossible</v>

489
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:45.540
<v Speaker 2>to see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as it moves,</v>

490
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:47.400
<v Speaker 2>you can see that there's something </v>
<v Speaker 2>moving,</v>

491
00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.790
<v Speaker 2>sort of like dinosaur vision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You remember?</v>

492
00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:50.893
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drastic park don't move because the </v>

493
00:26:53.311 --> 00:26:55.080
<v Speaker 2>dinosaur can see you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

494
00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.273
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have dinosaur movement detector </v>

495
00:26:57.901 --> 00:27:01.230
<v Speaker 2>still built into your nervous system and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question is why?</v>

496
00:27:01.231 --> 00:27:02.400
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

497
00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:03.893
<v Speaker 2>if you can't afford to have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain wired up to the periphery of </v>

498
00:27:08.161 --> 00:27:10.260
<v Speaker 2>your vision because your head is only so</v>
<v Speaker 2>big,</v>

499
00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:11.363
<v Speaker 2>then you have to concentrate on </v>
<v Speaker 2>detecting only those things that are </v>

500
00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:14.093
<v Speaker 2>most likely to be relevant and moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things are more likely to be relevant </v>

501
00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:18.203
<v Speaker 2>because they can eat you moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things are more likely to be relevant </v>

502
00:27:20.791 --> 00:27:21.624
<v Speaker 2>than stationary things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you've been in an </v>

503
00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:25.560
<v Speaker 2>environment for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

504
00:27:25.561 --> 00:27:26.880
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're in here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

505
00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:27.743
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stationary things are going to stay </v>

506
00:27:28.561 --> 00:27:30.780
<v Speaker 2>stationary so you can ignore them.</v>

507
00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:33.510
<v Speaker 2>You don't even have to see them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the moving things,</v>

508
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.720
<v Speaker 2>while they're transforming at a time </v>
<v Speaker 2>rate that's relevant to you,</v>

509
00:27:36.721 --> 00:27:38.610
<v Speaker 2>and so it's good to be able to detect </v>
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>

510
00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:43.410
<v Speaker 2>Now the periphery of your vision is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually wired in more directly to your,</v>

511
00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:44.843
<v Speaker 2>to your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the lower levels of your nervous </v>

512
00:27:46.111 --> 00:27:46.944
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it can trigger off things like </v>

513
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.030
<v Speaker 2>startle reflexes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are very rapid.</v>

514
00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:54.240
<v Speaker 2>And it also triggers an orienting </v>
<v Speaker 2>response,</v>

515
00:27:54.241 --> 00:27:55.074
<v Speaker 2>which is the movement of your sensory </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems in the direction of the </v>

516
00:27:57.661 --> 00:28:00.120
<v Speaker 2>stimulus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if something over here moves,</v>

517
00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:01.253
<v Speaker 2>then you go like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what you're doing is you're </v>

518
00:28:02.881 --> 00:28:05.550
<v Speaker 2>nailing it with your central vision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

519
00:28:05.551 --> 00:28:06.384
<v Speaker 2>out in your peripheral vision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you follow the optical track back to </v>

520
00:28:09.331 --> 00:28:14.331
<v Speaker 2>your brain and you'll see that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>peripheral retinal nerves don't attached</v>

521
00:28:14.571 --> 00:28:17.820
<v Speaker 2>to a tremendous number of visual cortex </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurons,</v>

522
00:28:17.821 --> 00:28:21.960
<v Speaker 2>but the central ones do so each of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>central neurons in your,</v>

523
00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.273
<v Speaker 2>in your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

524
00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.730
<v Speaker 2>central vision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the follow via,</v>

525
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:25.703
<v Speaker 2>each one of those is connected to 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>neurons at the first level of </v>

526
00:28:28.951 --> 00:28:29.790
<v Speaker 2>elaboration.</v>

527
00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:33.390
<v Speaker 2>And then each neuron is connected to </v>
<v Speaker 2>about 10,000 other neurons.</v>

528
00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:34.433
<v Speaker 2>So it's 10,000 to the 10 thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two neurons in and so a lot of your </v>

529
00:28:38.941 --> 00:28:42.960
<v Speaker 2>brain is focusing on that tiny little </v>
<v Speaker 2>pinpoint that you use.</v>

530
00:28:42.961 --> 00:28:47.280
<v Speaker 2>That's full vision and it seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>about big enough so that you can.</v>

531
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:48.223
<v Speaker 2>You can bring a face into high </v>
<v Speaker 2>resolution in the center and you can </v>

532
00:28:51.241 --> 00:28:53.910
<v Speaker 2>track the movements of the various </v>
<v Speaker 2>elements of the faces.</v>

533
00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:55.163
<v Speaker 2>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at someone and you look </v>

534
00:28:56.071 --> 00:28:58.860
<v Speaker 2>about 18 inches to their left or to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

535
00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:01.410
<v Speaker 2>you'll see that you can't see their nose</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

536
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:05.370
<v Speaker 2>You see a kind of a vague outline of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their face.</v>

537
00:29:05.371 --> 00:29:06.204
<v Speaker 2>You can still see the color,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can detect their eyebrows and you </v>

538
00:29:09.061 --> 00:29:12.000
<v Speaker 2>can detect their mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if their mouth moves or their</v>

539
00:29:12.001 --> 00:29:14.160
<v Speaker 2>eyes move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just zero in on that right away.</v>

540
00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:15.383
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what's happening is that way out </v>

541
00:29:17.071 --> 00:29:17.904
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're vision is incredibly low </v>

542
00:29:19.741 --> 00:29:23.880
<v Speaker 2>resolution and then the resolution </v>
<v Speaker 2>increases to the center where it's very,</v>

543
00:29:23.881 --> 00:29:27.780
<v Speaker 2>very high and you and but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's some tweaks like,</v>

544
00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:29.370
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't really see out here,</v>

545
00:29:29.371 --> 00:29:30.204
<v Speaker 2>but you can see motion and that's good </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough because as soon as something </v>

546
00:29:32.641 --> 00:29:33.474
<v Speaker 2>moves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can turn your head because you can </v>

547
00:29:34.291 --> 00:29:38.340
<v Speaker 2>turn your head and your eyes and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can focus that little pinpoint on it</v>

548
00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.950
<v Speaker 2>and dance around because that's what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do with the pinpoint.</v>

549
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:46.030
<v Speaker 2>It moves around very rapidly and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can scan that central area with,</v>

550
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:47.133
<v Speaker 2>with high resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's an efficient use of limited </v>

551
00:29:49.451 --> 00:29:51.130
<v Speaker 2>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

552
00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:54.850
<v Speaker 2>so partly the way that you manage in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

553
00:29:54.851 --> 00:29:56.230
<v Speaker 2>which is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very complicated,</v>

554
00:29:56.231 --> 00:29:59.290
<v Speaker 2>is that even your senses simplify it for</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

555
00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's only.</v>

556
00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:05.170
<v Speaker 2>You can't see the entire spectrum of </v>
<v Speaker 2>electromagnetic radiation.</v>

557
00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:06.820
<v Speaker 2>You can only see the visual light </v>
<v Speaker 2>spectrum.</v>

558
00:30:06.821 --> 00:30:07.654
<v Speaker 2>It's very narrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole range of sounds you </v>

559
00:30:09.611 --> 00:30:11.800
<v Speaker 2>can't hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's things you can't smell.</v>

560
00:30:11.801 --> 00:30:12.634
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in a box and some things get </v>

561
00:30:14.741 --> 00:30:15.640
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not everything.</v>

562
00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:18.310
<v Speaker 2>So that simplifies things for you right </v>
<v Speaker 2>off the bat.</v>

563
00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:19.683
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically those things you do </v>

564
00:30:20.981 --> 00:30:21.814
<v Speaker 2>detect where those things that it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary for you to detect for you to </v>

565
00:30:24.401 --> 00:30:28.540
<v Speaker 2>be here over this vast span of time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>no doubt there were variants all the way</v>

566
00:30:28.541 --> 00:30:30.580
<v Speaker 2>through that tried to parse it up </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently,</v>

567
00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:33.250
<v Speaker 2>slightly differently and that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>work out as well.</v>

568
00:30:33.251 --> 00:30:37.840
<v Speaker 2>So they aren't around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're around because of this,</v>

569
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:40.180
<v Speaker 2>of death and replication so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

570
00:30:40.181 --> 00:30:41.014
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting take on debt thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're the product of an </v>

571
00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:48.250
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable number of deaths,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

572
00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:52.690
<v Speaker 2>Because all of those experiments have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take place in some sense for there to be</v>

573
00:30:52.691 --> 00:30:54.670
<v Speaker 2>you to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for you to be here at all.</v>

574
00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:56.590
<v Speaker 2>So anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

575
00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:58.053
<v Speaker 2>Then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can see with your central vision </v>

576
00:31:01.901 --> 00:31:02.734
<v Speaker 2>that you're focusing on one point and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you reduce the others too to low </v>

577
00:31:06.281 --> 00:31:08.980
<v Speaker 2>resolution representations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe even cartoons.</v>

578
00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.233
<v Speaker 2>And then I also think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I don't know this for sure in </v>

579
00:31:11.831 --> 00:31:15.130
<v Speaker 2>someone has undoubtedly done the work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My suspicions are,</v>

580
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:18.460
<v Speaker 2>is that in the periphery you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>update,</v>

581
00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:22.270
<v Speaker 2>you know how your screen updates 60 </v>
<v Speaker 2>cycles a second,</v>

582
00:31:22.271 --> 00:31:23.104
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You updated your vision at about 60 </v>

583
00:31:25.391 --> 00:31:26.224
<v Speaker 2>cycles per second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we know that because if the screen </v>

584
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:32.530
<v Speaker 2>resolution or if the screen update </v>
<v Speaker 2>decreases below 60 cycles a second,</v>

585
00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:36.220
<v Speaker 2>people can start to see it flicker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we have a refresh rate.</v>

586
00:31:36.221 --> 00:31:40.330
<v Speaker 2>It's around 60 hertz and some people can</v>
<v Speaker 2>see flicker at higher</v>

587
00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.110
<v Speaker 2>and higher hertz the nap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

588
00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:45.280
<v Speaker 2>but most people can't.</v>

589
00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:50.280
<v Speaker 2>Sixty is about right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's another way that you deal with</v>

590
00:31:50.681 --> 00:31:53.780
<v Speaker 2>the fact that there's way too much for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you to deal with your.</v>

591
00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.020
<v Speaker 2>Your temporal resolution isn't very </v>
<v Speaker 2>high,</v>

592
00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:59.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the smallest meaningful event for you</v>

593
00:31:59.261 --> 00:32:00.094
<v Speaker 2>is about a 10th of a second long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's if you're in a car accident or </v>

594
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:06.880
<v Speaker 2>you're in some situation where it's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>emergency and you get a massive burst of</v>

595
00:32:06.881 --> 00:32:07.714
<v Speaker 2>dopamine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might be able to speed that process </v>

596
00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.440
<v Speaker 2>up by 100 fold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows,</v>

597
00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:14.710
<v Speaker 2>but you're going to be absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>exhausted instantly when you do that.</v>

598
00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:18.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've ever experienced </v>
<v Speaker 2>that in a car accident or something like</v>

599
00:32:18.101 --> 00:32:18.934
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people often report that time slows </v>

600
00:32:21.131 --> 00:32:25.720
<v Speaker 2>down dramatically and but then </v>
<v Speaker 2>afterwards they're just there.</v>

601
00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:26.793
<v Speaker 2>They're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the reason you don't see a thousand </v>

602
00:32:29.201 --> 00:32:32.470
<v Speaker 2>times as fast as you do is because you'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be eating like a Hummingbird,</v>

603
00:32:32.471 --> 00:32:34.750
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need a big Vat of nectar attached to</v>

604
00:32:34.751 --> 00:32:38.290
<v Speaker 2>you and you'd be just sipping on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are gulping it down nonstop.</v>

605
00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:41.870
<v Speaker 2>So you're kind of restricted in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your temporal resolution.</v>

606
00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:45.283
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then what else do you do to </v>

607
00:32:47.271 --> 00:32:48.260
<v Speaker 2>simplify the world?</v>

608
00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:49.323
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

609
00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:53.580
<v Speaker 2>this is where the tool concept of</v>

610
00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.810
<v Speaker 2>concept,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two old concept of concept starts to</v>

611
00:32:57.811 --> 00:33:02.700
<v Speaker 2>become useful because you're actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>aiming at things all the time.</v>

612
00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:03.713
<v Speaker 2>And I really liked the aim metaphor </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you understand the metaphor </v>

613
00:33:07.351 --> 00:33:08.184
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really shed some light on what human </v>

614
00:33:09.871 --> 00:33:13.110
<v Speaker 2>beings are like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chimps are hunters,</v>

615
00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.840
<v Speaker 2>but they're not hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like human beings are hunters,</v>

616
00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:17.520
<v Speaker 2>were really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good hunters.</v>

617
00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:18.773
<v Speaker 2>Chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to kind of mob an animal and </v>

618
00:33:20.011 --> 00:33:21.510
<v Speaker 2>then they'll tear it apart and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>liked.</v>

619
00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:23.580
<v Speaker 2>They liked me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they'll definitely do it.</v>

620
00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:24.803
<v Speaker 2>But human beings have been hunting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>an unbelievably sophisticated way for a </v>

621
00:33:27.661 --> 00:33:28.494
<v Speaker 2>tremendous amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a bunch of things about us </v>

622
00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:32.483
<v Speaker 2>that aren't like chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one is we can throw and our bodies </v>

623
00:33:36.661 --> 00:33:38.580
<v Speaker 2>are built for throwing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you might think,</v>

624
00:33:38.581 --> 00:33:39.414
<v Speaker 2>well that's not that relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if something is chasing you through </v>

625
00:33:41.131 --> 00:33:41.964
<v Speaker 2>the Bush and you can throw a rock at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes relevant very quickly and so </v>

626
00:33:45.481 --> 00:33:50.481
<v Speaker 2>we're really good at taking projectiles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>specifying targets and hurling,</v>

627
00:33:50.941 --> 00:33:54.480
<v Speaker 2>the projectiles out targets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we can do that with rocks and we can</v>

628
00:33:54.481 --> 00:33:55.314
<v Speaker 2>do it with bows and we can do it with </v>
<v Speaker 2>rifles and we can do it with nuclear </v>

629
00:33:58.861 --> 00:33:59.694
<v Speaker 2>weapons.</v>

630
00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:00.683
<v Speaker 2>And so there's something about us that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with hitting the middle of the </v>

631
00:34:03.031 --> 00:34:08.031
<v Speaker 2>target.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there's an interesting side note for</v>

632
00:34:08.041 --> 00:34:08.874
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that the word sin is derived </v>

633
00:34:11.131 --> 00:34:15.510
<v Speaker 2>from the Greek word Hamartia and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hamartia is an archery term.</v>

634
00:34:15.511 --> 00:34:17.910
<v Speaker 2>That means to miss the center of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>target.</v>

635
00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:21.360
<v Speaker 2>So now that's something very much we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about.</v>

636
00:34:21.361 --> 00:34:22.194
<v Speaker 2>It's a very lovely concordance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we're built on this hunting </v>

637
00:34:25.411 --> 00:34:26.244
<v Speaker 2>platform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can track moving things </v>

638
00:34:27.151 --> 00:34:29.940
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have the amazing eyesight,</v>

639
00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:31.313
<v Speaker 2>our eyesight's better than any primate </v>
<v Speaker 2>by a huge amount and better than any </v>

640
00:34:34.051 --> 00:34:36.810
<v Speaker 2>other creature except for like hawks and</v>
<v Speaker 2>other birds of prey.</v>

641
00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:39.270
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we also you,</v>

642
00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:40.413
<v Speaker 2>so we have this amazing capacity to zero</v>
<v Speaker 2>in and here's some cool things about </v>

643
00:34:44.011 --> 00:34:46.560
<v Speaker 2>your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at a gorilla,</v>

644
00:34:46.561 --> 00:34:47.394
<v Speaker 2>you'll see that a gorilla doesn't really</v>
<v Speaker 2>have whites in their eyes and you might </v>

645
00:34:50.251 --> 00:34:52.260
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's kind of weird because we do.</v>

646
00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.900
<v Speaker 2>And so what's the hypothesis?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

647
00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:57.630
<v Speaker 2>if I'm looking at somebody at the back </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the room,</v>

648
00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:01.020
<v Speaker 2>I can tell if they're looking at my </v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes,</v>

649
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:02.780
<v Speaker 2>if they're looking at my nose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

650
00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:03.633
<v Speaker 2>it's almost as if their face just gets a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit vaguer like we're not </v>

651
00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:07.163
<v Speaker 2>communicating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's either icontact and so our ability </v>

652
00:35:09.721 --> 00:35:10.554
<v Speaker 2>to specify the direction in which </v>
<v Speaker 2>another person's eyes are pointing is </v>

653
00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:17.610
<v Speaker 2>phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>

654
00:35:17.611 --> 00:35:18.444
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

655
00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:19.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

656
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.800
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of expression around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes,</v>

657
00:35:22.801 --> 00:35:23.634
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can imagine a coevolution the </v>

658
00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:27.150
<v Speaker 2>coevolution is sharper and sharper </v>
<v Speaker 2>vision,</v>

659
00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:28.733
<v Speaker 2>vision associated with detecting eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then also more and more evolution </v>

660
00:35:32.611 --> 00:35:33.444
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for emotional expression around the </v>

661
00:35:34.861 --> 00:35:36.780
<v Speaker 2>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's that.</v>

662
00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:38.483
<v Speaker 2>But then</v>

663
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:41.640
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that I wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason that I would be interested in</v>

664
00:35:41.641 --> 00:35:45.690
<v Speaker 1>that is because I want to know what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell you're up to because maybe you're a</v>

665
00:35:45.691 --> 00:35:46.524
<v Speaker 1>friend and maybe you're full or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're interested in something that I </v>

666
00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:51.960
<v Speaker 1>should be interested in and so we know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what people are like in that regard.</v>

667
00:35:51.961 --> 00:35:56.640
<v Speaker 1>So you go stand out on the corner and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you look up and soon there are 10 people</v>

668
00:35:56.641 --> 00:35:59.400
<v Speaker 1>gathered around you looking at and why </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that?</v>

669
00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:04.640
<v Speaker 1>It's because when they see where your </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes are pointed and embody you,</v>

670
00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:06.361
<v Speaker 1>they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

671
00:36:06.361 --> 00:36:07.740
<v Speaker 1>that person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't think this.</v>

672
00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:10.440
<v Speaker 1>It's the equivalent of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think,</v>

673
00:36:10.441 --> 00:36:12.060
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person must be looking at something</v>

674
00:36:12.061 --> 00:36:15.720
<v Speaker 1>interesting because that's what people </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at and if it's interesting to them,</v>

675
00:36:15.721 --> 00:36:17.580
<v Speaker 1>then it's probably going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting to me.</v>

676
00:36:17.581 --> 00:36:19.020
<v Speaker 1>Especially if it's in the sky.</v>

677
00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:21.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not supposed to be happening.</v>

678
00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:25.410
<v Speaker 1>So you're looking at people's eyes </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you want to know what they're up</v>

679
00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:26.243
<v Speaker 1>to in their facial display,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is your face is unbelievably </v>

680
00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:30.383
<v Speaker 1>innervated and controllable both by </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious and unconscious means that </v>

681
00:36:33.781 --> 00:36:34.614
<v Speaker 1>tells you what they're up to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why you want to see someone's </v>

682
00:36:36.721 --> 00:36:37.554
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't talk to the back of their </v>

683
00:36:38.431 --> 00:36:39.264
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to talk to their face and you </v>

684
00:36:40.411 --> 00:36:43.140
<v Speaker 1>don't like it when they're looking like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this or looking like that.</v>

685
00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:44.123
<v Speaker 1>Or failing to make eye contact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although too much eye contact as a </v>

686
00:36:46.921 --> 00:36:48.790
<v Speaker 1>predatory stair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

687
00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:51.690
<v Speaker 1>well you got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to get the balance right.</v>

688
00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:55.590
<v Speaker 1>So now what about the whites of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes?</v>

689
00:36:55.591 --> 00:36:56.424
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the theory is is that the reason we </v>

690
00:36:57.241 --> 00:36:58.074
<v Speaker 1>developed the whites is because it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>easier to see where someone's eyes were </v>

691
00:37:00.541 --> 00:37:01.020
<v Speaker 1>appointed.</v>

692
00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:03.180
<v Speaker 1>If there was a dark circle in a white </v>
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

693
00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:07.620
<v Speaker 1>And what that basically meant was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>all your ancestors who are a little less</v>

694
00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:08.813
<v Speaker 1>fortunate on the white side either </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't mate or got killed probably </v>

695
00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:15.500
<v Speaker 1>misunderstandings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

696
00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:16.473
<v Speaker 1>so rois are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stand out against this bright white </v>

697
00:37:18.691 --> 00:37:19.524
<v Speaker 1>background because that helps us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that helps other people detect what </v>

698
00:37:22.231 --> 00:37:23.064
<v Speaker 1>we're up to and that means we can trust </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other more easily and we can even </v>

699
00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:27.263
<v Speaker 1>something as simple as like eye contact </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a situation where there's a </v>

700
00:37:31.171 --> 00:37:32.004
<v Speaker 1>possibility of finding a sexual partners</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a very important component of that </v>

701
00:37:35.611 --> 00:37:40.320
<v Speaker 1>because I contact indicates interest and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also indicates at least in principle,</v>

702
00:37:40.321 --> 00:37:43.830
<v Speaker 1>the possibility of approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so approaches,</v>

703
00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:44.683
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this dopaminergic Lee mediated and it's </v>

704
00:37:47.071 --> 00:37:47.904
<v Speaker 1>a positive emotional state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's also why interestingly </v>

705
00:37:51.061 --> 00:37:52.950
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go into a grocery,</v>

706
00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:53.813
<v Speaker 1>into a pharmacy and there's a rock of </v>
<v Speaker 1>magazines and there what's on the cover </v>

707
00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:02.970
<v Speaker 1>always almost always beautiful woman.</v>

708
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:05.910
<v Speaker 1>Like on 50 percent of the men's </v>
<v Speaker 1>magazines,</v>

709
00:38:05.911 --> 00:38:09.180
<v Speaker 1>there's a beautiful woman and knowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent of the women's magazines,</v>

710
00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.050
<v Speaker 1>which is really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

711
00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:13.230
<v Speaker 1>because you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why is that?</v>

712
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:14.333
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the woman's eyes are always looking </v>

713
00:38:15.721 --> 00:38:17.580
<v Speaker 1>out in a way that they're looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

714
00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:23.240
<v Speaker 1>So there was some interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's an invocation of interest.</v>

715
00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:24.570
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

716
00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:27.450
<v Speaker 1>magazines evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the ones that don't get bought fail.</v>

717
00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:28.763
<v Speaker 1>And so what's happened is they all </v>
<v Speaker 1>converge to the same point in the same </v>

718
00:38:30.961 --> 00:38:35.500
<v Speaker 1>point is the thing that's maximally </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting to a magazine purchaser</v>

719
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.820
<v Speaker 2>is a fee is a beautiful female face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's male or female.</v>

720
00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.700
<v Speaker 2>Now on the male side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just also gadgets of all sorts.</v>

721
00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:44.223
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that may be because men are more </v>

722
00:38:45.371 --> 00:38:48.550
<v Speaker 2>gadget oriented than women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

723
00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:51.940
<v Speaker 2>and we also know that for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with men,</v>

724
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.940
<v Speaker 2>if you show them this is a funny little </v>
<v Speaker 2>study,</v>

725
00:38:55.900 --> 00:39:00.400
<v Speaker 2>so you show them a view of the face of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful woman and her eyes are looking</v>

726
00:39:00.401 --> 00:39:03.310
<v Speaker 2>that way or this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they're looking right at him.</v>

727
00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:04.443
<v Speaker 2>You can check the activity and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dopaminergic center in a place called </v>

728
00:39:07.391 --> 00:39:08.224
<v Speaker 2>the nucleus accumbens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the same place that cocaine </v>

729
00:39:09.791 --> 00:39:12.820
<v Speaker 2>hits face on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I contact that thing,</v>

730
00:39:12.821 --> 00:39:13.654
<v Speaker 2>lights up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it lights up even more if she's wearing </v>

731
00:39:15.281 --> 00:39:17.560
<v Speaker 2>a red dress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

732
00:39:17.561 --> 00:39:20.530
<v Speaker 2>And you can get the same kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>lighting up with a red,</v>

733
00:39:20.531 --> 00:39:23.320
<v Speaker 2>curvy sportscar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's the,</v>

734
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:24.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

735
00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:25.630
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my thought would,</v>

736
00:39:25.631 --> 00:39:27.370
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

737
00:39:27.371 --> 00:39:28.204
<v Speaker 2>I read that was the perfect situation is</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a beautiful girl dressed in red </v>

738
00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:34.180
<v Speaker 2>purse on the sports car with some </v>
<v Speaker 2>cocaine.</v>

739
00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:40.380
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Randy?</v>

740
00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:41.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good.</v>

741
00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.650
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not exactly sure why that's wrong.</v>

742
00:39:44.651 --> 00:39:49.651
<v Speaker 2>I do know why red ripe fruit</v>
<v Speaker 2>women have coevolved with right fruit,</v>

743
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.823
<v Speaker 2>sneaky of you by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's why you know that you just </v>

744
00:39:57.521 --> 00:39:58.354
<v Speaker 2>have to lead through women's magazine </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the lipstick is always associated </v>

745
00:40:01.271 --> 00:40:05.170
<v Speaker 2>with apples that are glistening in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>way or a peach or something like that.</v>

746
00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:06.333
<v Speaker 2>And where we were primarily fruit eaters</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason we have color vision is </v>

747
00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:15.220
<v Speaker 2>to detect fruit ripe fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so part of the reason that also part</v>

748
00:40:15.221 --> 00:40:16.054
<v Speaker 2>of the reason that fruit turns red or </v>
<v Speaker 2>colored when it ripens is because the </v>

749
00:40:19.181 --> 00:40:20.014
<v Speaker 2>fruit that was successfully eaten by </v>
<v Speaker 2>creatures that distributed this six </v>

750
00:40:22.671 --> 00:40:26.050
<v Speaker 2>seeds was the fruit that was right when </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was eating.</v>

751
00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.153
<v Speaker 2>And so as the color vision evolved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe there was a red tint for God only </v>

752
00:40:29.681 --> 00:40:30.610
<v Speaker 2>knows what reason.</v>

753
00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:31.773
<v Speaker 2>Then a positive feedback loop developed </v>
<v Speaker 2>and fruit got redder and redder and at </v>

754
00:40:35.231 --> 00:40:39.580
<v Speaker 2>the same time women capitalized on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's partly,</v>

755
00:40:39.581 --> 00:40:42.820
<v Speaker 2>I think what explains the association </v>
<v Speaker 2>between Eve and the apple in,</v>

756
00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.500
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in genesis,</v>

757
00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.920
<v Speaker 2>because genesis is always also a story </v>
<v Speaker 2>about gaming site.</v>

758
00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:50.260
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why red.</v>

759
00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:53.170
<v Speaker 2>So that's pretty funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really think that's pretty funny.</v>

760
00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:56.500
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolved more evolved.</v>

761
00:40:56.820 --> 00:41:00.040
<v Speaker 2>Sensory significance is absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere,</v>

762
00:41:00.041 --> 00:41:00.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

763
00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:02.680
<v Speaker 2>it's so deep inside of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

764
00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:06.230
<v Speaker 2>I have to wonder about lead to it seems </v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

765
00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:07.541
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

766
00:41:07.541 --> 00:41:09.430
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Red's a significant color.</v>

767
00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:11.410
<v Speaker 2>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

768
00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:15.520
<v Speaker 2>and it's funny too because say say </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a flushed face will.</v>

769
00:41:15.521 --> 00:41:18.850
<v Speaker 2>That means it's infused with blood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also a sign of health.</v>

770
00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:22.180
<v Speaker 2>It's also a sign of sexual arousal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is a sign of health.</v>

771
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:26.680
<v Speaker 2>And so you see in an old coke ads from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the 19 thirties,</v>

772
00:41:26.681 --> 00:41:28.580
<v Speaker 2>the girls cheeks are so red that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

773
00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.630
<v Speaker 2>it looks like she has a fever so often </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

774
00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:35.630
<v Speaker 2>it's a form of signaling that indicates </v>
<v Speaker 2>a health.</v>

775
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:38.930
<v Speaker 2>So that's another part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean these are multiply determined,</v>

776
00:41:38.931 --> 00:41:39.764
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And is there anything as complex as </v>

777
00:41:40.851 --> 00:41:41.750
<v Speaker 2>vision?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

778
00:41:41.751 --> 00:41:42.590
<v Speaker 2>And blood means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

779
00:41:42.591 --> 00:41:45.830
<v Speaker 2>maybe don't go there or maybe it means </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something to eat.</v>

780
00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:46.963
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

781
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:47.833
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

782
00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:49.860
<v Speaker 4>You mentioned that there was another </v>
<v Speaker 4>period of</v>

783
00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:55.193
<v Speaker 4>facial expressions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but depending on whether you're angry </v>

784
00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:00.020
<v Speaker 4>or.</v>

785
00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:00.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

786
00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:02.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you can see that those things would</v>

787
00:42:02.601 --> 00:42:03.520
<v Speaker 2>loop together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

788
00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:09.130
<v Speaker 2>Once the color vision starts to adapt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably the color vision for fruit</v>

789
00:42:09.141 --> 00:42:14.141
<v Speaker 2>is way older I would suspect because </v>
<v Speaker 2>when we developed it we had for so,</v>

790
00:42:14.481 --> 00:42:17.390
<v Speaker 2>but once the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once the ability's there and we lose our</v>

791
00:42:17.391 --> 00:42:21.290
<v Speaker 2>facial for then it's possible to </v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalize on that ability to detect the</v>

792
00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:22.450
<v Speaker 2>signaling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

793
00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:25.540
<v Speaker 2>when we're talking about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformation over about we were,</v>

794
00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:27.830
<v Speaker 2>we were living in trees about 60 million</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

795
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:32.480
<v Speaker 2>so the transition between us and them is</v>
<v Speaker 2>60 million years.</v>

796
00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:34.680
<v Speaker 2>The separation from champs is about </v>
<v Speaker 2>seven.</v>

797
00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:36.280
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

798
00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:37.273
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chips skin is so dark that you're not </v>

799
00:42:40.401 --> 00:42:42.440
<v Speaker 2>going to get a lot of signaling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

800
00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:44.410
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

801
00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:45.501
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

802
00:42:45.501 --> 00:42:48.560
<v Speaker 2>so back to this little diagram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

803
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:50.630
<v Speaker 2>here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the idea,</v>

804
00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:53.960
<v Speaker 2>and this is also informed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is deeply informed,</v>

805
00:42:53.961 --> 00:42:56.960
<v Speaker 2>although I didn't know when I developed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was working on these ideas,</v>

806
00:42:56.961 --> 00:42:57.794
<v Speaker 2>this is deeply informed by a guy named </v>
<v Speaker 2>Norbert Wiener who was one of the 20th </v>

807
00:43:02.481 --> 00:43:07.481
<v Speaker 2>century's massive geniuses and a force </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind the development of computation,</v>

808
00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:13.100
<v Speaker 2>and so this is a cybernetic model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He invented cybernetics.</v>

809
00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:18.520
<v Speaker 2>Now I didn't learn this from no Norbert </v>
<v Speaker 2>Wiener because I learned it from Jeffrey</v>

810
00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:19.873
<v Speaker 2>Gray,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Jeffrey Gray's sources learned it </v>

811
00:43:21.381 --> 00:43:23.720
<v Speaker 2>from Norbert Wiener way back in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 2>forties.</v>

812
00:43:23.721 --> 00:43:24.554
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a convention back in the 19 </v>

813
00:43:25.941 --> 00:43:26.774
<v Speaker 2>forties that when you're presented many </v>
<v Speaker 2>of his ideas at that many psychologists </v>

814
00:43:30.381 --> 00:43:32.470
<v Speaker 2>attended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including Sean Psj,</v>

815
00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:33.663
<v Speaker 2>and so piaget's theory is very much </v>
<v Speaker 2>influenced by cybernetics as well and </v>

816
00:43:36.621 --> 00:43:37.460
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

817
00:43:37.461 --> 00:43:42.461
<v Speaker 2>many of the standard psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cognitive models are cybernetic,</v>

818
00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:43.683
<v Speaker 2>and so they're grounded in thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's actually doing engineering </v>

819
00:43:45.501 --> 00:43:47.630
<v Speaker 2>thinking and not psychological thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>

820
00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:48.613
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

821
00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:51.263
<v Speaker 4>Cybernetics,</v>

822
00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:53.210
<v Speaker 2>no dianetics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

823
00:43:53.211 --> 00:43:54.044
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

824
00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:56.510
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

825
00:43:56.511 --> 00:43:57.344
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

826
00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:00.373
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how might you conceptualize the </v>

827
00:44:01.851 --> 00:44:04.130
<v Speaker 2>fundamental elements of a personality?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

828
00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.560
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what it looks like to me.</v>

829
00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:09.140
<v Speaker 2>The first thing is you're a moving </v>
<v Speaker 2>creature.</v>

830
00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:10.993
<v Speaker 2>So here's a funny story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this little animal whose name I </v>

831
00:44:13.131 --> 00:44:16.370
<v Speaker 2>forget,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's juvenile.</v>

832
00:44:16.371 --> 00:44:18.620
<v Speaker 2>It's an ocean animal and it's juvenile </v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

833
00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.480
<v Speaker 2>It swims around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

834
00:44:20.481 --> 00:44:22.690
<v Speaker 2>so it's juvenile state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has,</v>

835
00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:27.110
<v Speaker 2>it has to coordinate it's movements and </v>
<v Speaker 2>interact with the changing environment.</v>

836
00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:30.530
<v Speaker 2>So it has a brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then when it turns into an adult,</v>

837
00:44:30.531 --> 00:44:33.970
<v Speaker 2>it attaches itself to a rock and turns </v>
<v Speaker 2>into something that's sort of like a,</v>

838
00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:35.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a piece of coral.</v>

839
00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:39.180
<v Speaker 2>It promptly digests its own brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the issue is,</v>

840
00:44:39.181 --> 00:44:41.970
<v Speaker 2>unless you don't really need a brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not going to go anywhere,</v>

841
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:42.833
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a brain is going places thing and we </v>

842
00:44:45.511 --> 00:44:48.660
<v Speaker 2>have a very big brain and so it's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're always zooming around doing things</v>

843
00:44:48.661 --> 00:44:49.494
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got these hands that enable us to </v>

844
00:44:51.481 --> 00:44:53.370
<v Speaker 2>manipulate things and transform things.</v>

845
00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:57.350
<v Speaker 2>And so the brand is for doing things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just for perceive it.</v>

846
00:44:57.570 --> 00:44:58.403
<v Speaker 2>Roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the back half of your brain is for </v>

847
00:45:01.201 --> 00:45:02.670
<v Speaker 2>perception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cortical part,</v>

848
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:03.533
<v Speaker 2>mostly visual perception,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some auditory and touch a lot of </v>

849
00:45:06.181 --> 00:45:07.014
<v Speaker 2>digital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the front part is for output motor </v>

850
00:45:09.961 --> 00:45:13.110
<v Speaker 2>action,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as you proceed,</v>

851
00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.900
<v Speaker 2>imagine the front part starts halfway </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

852
00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:16.913
<v Speaker 2>As you proceed from the midline forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the auction becomes more and more </v>

853
00:45:20.521 --> 00:45:24.060
<v Speaker 2>abstract until when you're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dorsolateral prefrontal Cortex,</v>

854
00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:26.280
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking abstractly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

855
00:45:26.281 --> 00:45:28.600
<v Speaker 2>people think that when they're thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstractly,</v>

856
00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:30.960
<v Speaker 2>they're thinking about representations </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world,</v>

857
00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:33.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we think we think about objects,</v>

858
00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:37.800
<v Speaker 2>but that isn't what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we're doing is rehearsing potential</v>

859
00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:42.120
<v Speaker 2>schemas of action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have this abstract space which you</v>

860
00:45:42.121 --> 00:45:45.900
<v Speaker 2>might think about as a duplicate world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have an idea,</v>

861
00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:46.973
<v Speaker 2>you test the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you would test it if you were </v>

862
00:45:48.991 --> 00:45:49.824
<v Speaker 2>acting it out in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if the consequence of the imaginary </v>

863
00:45:52.441 --> 00:45:56.760
<v Speaker 2>testing is you encounter grief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you don't implement the idea in the</v>

864
00:45:56.761 --> 00:45:57.594
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

865
00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:58.433
<v Speaker 2>Now you know that doesn't always work </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's tradeoffs between short </v>

866
00:46:00.781 --> 00:46:03.840
<v Speaker 2>term pleasure in longterm punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes it complicated.</v>

867
00:46:03.841 --> 00:46:07.260
<v Speaker 2>But what seems to have happened is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>as we've evolved,</v>

868
00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:09.720
<v Speaker 2>we're very sneaky creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

869
00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:10.913
<v Speaker 2>for billions of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only way that you could figure out </v>

870
00:46:14.191 --> 00:46:16.860
<v Speaker 2>whether you're right or wrong was to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and do something and if you died you</v>

871
00:46:16.861 --> 00:46:18.880
<v Speaker 2>were wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

872
00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:21.600
<v Speaker 2>but now you can think about doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

873
00:46:21.601 --> 00:46:22.434
<v Speaker 2>Andy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the consequence of running the </v>

874
00:46:24.001 --> 00:46:27.870
<v Speaker 2>simulation in your head is that you die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you don't do it.</v>

875
00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:29.183
<v Speaker 2>And so what you're basically doing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>spinning off multiple potential use in </v>

876
00:46:33.781 --> 00:46:36.870
<v Speaker 2>multiple potential universities and </v>
<v Speaker 2>running them as simulations,</v>

877
00:46:36.871 --> 00:46:37.704
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now we really do that now because </v>

878
00:46:38.761 --> 00:46:40.770
<v Speaker 2>we've externalized it onto the computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

879
00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:43.770
<v Speaker 2>Which is what we're doing with really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really complex video games.</v>

880
00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:45.670
<v Speaker 2>So it's so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

881
00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:48.720
<v Speaker 2>it's an amazing evolutionary advance.</v>

882
00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:49.553
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work that well because </v>

883
00:46:50.491 --> 00:46:52.410
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you run the simulation and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

884
00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:53.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this would,</v>

885
00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:54.803
<v Speaker 2>this is a stupid idea and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably have a beer so that you could </v>

886
00:46:57.271 --> 00:46:58.620
<v Speaker 2>go do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

887
00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:01.260
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all things considered,</v>

888
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:04.410
<v Speaker 2>that's still what this abstract spaces </v>
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>

889
00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:06.480
<v Speaker 2>I should tell you something about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

890
00:47:06.481 --> 00:47:07.314
<v Speaker 2>because you're going to hear from neuro </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologists that a lot of what the </v>

891
00:47:10.591 --> 00:47:11.424
<v Speaker 2>dorsolateral prefrontal cortex does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the prefrontal cortex in general is </v>

892
00:47:14.221 --> 00:47:17.040
<v Speaker 2>impulse control and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's wrong.</v>

893
00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:18.293
<v Speaker 2>That is not what it does and part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason I know this is because the </v>

894
00:47:21.451 --> 00:47:25.650
<v Speaker 2>correlation between prefrontal cortical </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive ability,</v>

895
00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:28.920
<v Speaker 2>which is very tightly associated with Iq</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

896
00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:29.763
<v Speaker 2>like the correlations like point nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you could even argue it's the same </v>

897
00:47:32.981 --> 00:47:34.570
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fluid Iq in particular,</v>

898
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:35.703
<v Speaker 2>the correlation between Dorsolateral </v>
<v Speaker 2>prefrontal cognitive capacity and </v>

899
00:47:41.081 --> 00:47:45.820
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like longterm goal directed,</v>

900
00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:49.930
<v Speaker 2>future oriented planned activity is </v>
<v Speaker 2>zero.</v>

901
00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:51.793
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zero is a very bad correlation when </v>

902
00:47:53.951 --> 00:47:55.480
<v Speaker 2>you're driving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the old idea,</v>

903
00:47:55.481 --> 00:48:00.481
<v Speaker 2>you correlation doesn't imply causality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well wrong.</v>

904
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:01.833
<v Speaker 2>It does strongly imply causality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't demonstrate it because with </v>

905
00:48:04.841 --> 00:48:07.630
<v Speaker 2>every crop causal relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a correlation.</v>

906
00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:12.790
<v Speaker 2>So 100 percent of causally related items</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a correlation,</v>

907
00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:15.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent correlation.</v>

908
00:48:15.071 --> 00:48:15.611
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

909
00:48:15.611 --> 00:48:16.444
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it implies correlation does not </v>

910
00:48:18.671 --> 00:48:20.470
<v Speaker 2>prove it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

911
00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:23.650
<v Speaker 2>but zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

912
00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:24.573
<v Speaker 2>that's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means that those things aren't </v>

913
00:48:26.291 --> 00:48:27.070
<v Speaker 2>related.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

914
00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:27.903
<v Speaker 2>if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can understand why they have to be </v>

915
00:48:30.371 --> 00:48:35.371
<v Speaker 2>unrelated because if you embodied your </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstractions,</v>

916
00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:38.650
<v Speaker 2>then you wouldn't be able to experiment </v>
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>

917
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:41.290
<v Speaker 2>You just act them out and then bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be dead,</v>

918
00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:42.363
<v Speaker 2>so you have to separate the cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>activity from the embodiment completely </v>

919
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:50.290
<v Speaker 2>so that you can choose which of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential selves to incarnate,</v>

920
00:48:50.291 --> 00:48:52.000
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

921
00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:53.253
<v Speaker 2>the prefrontal Cortex is a complex place</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the lower parts of it seem to be </v>

922
00:48:56.591 --> 00:48:57.424
<v Speaker 2>more related to the relationship between</v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive activity and the control of </v>

923
00:49:02.891 --> 00:49:05.680
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have tried 50 tasks.</v>

924
00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:06.513
<v Speaker 2>I bet trying to get a correlation with </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness and we haven't found </v>

925
00:49:09.431 --> 00:49:11.530
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We cannot cope.</v>

926
00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:12.513
<v Speaker 2>The reason I'm telling you this because </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness is a very good </v>

927
00:49:14.351 --> 00:49:16.750
<v Speaker 2>predictor of longterm life success,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

928
00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:17.843
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's you guys get your grades for two </v>

929
00:49:19.511 --> 00:49:20.410
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

930
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:24.310
<v Speaker 2>you're smart if assuming you are and two</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you work hard,</v>

931
00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:27.910
<v Speaker 2>assuming that you do that eats up almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the variance in your grades.</v>

932
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.150
<v Speaker 2>Creativity is zero correlation with </v>
<v Speaker 2>grades at u of t by the way.</v>

933
00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:36.100
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's extraordinarily comical </v>
<v Speaker 2>and completely completely unsurprising.</v>

934
00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:37.233
<v Speaker 2>So it's hard for an institution to </v>
<v Speaker 2>greater creativity because it's an </v>

935
00:49:42.161 --> 00:49:45.190
<v Speaker 2>institution and the problem with being </v>
<v Speaker 2>creative is that you,</v>

936
00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:48.880
<v Speaker 2>you forced people to come up with a new </v>
<v Speaker 2>grading scheme.</v>

937
00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:49.781
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

938
00:49:49.781 --> 00:49:51.730
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

939
00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:52.593
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you come up with something </v>

940
00:49:53.051 --> 00:49:54.160
<v Speaker 2>creative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's different.</v>

941
00:49:54.161 --> 00:49:55.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do with that?</v>

942
00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:56.290
<v Speaker 2>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't do that.</v>

943
00:49:56.291 --> 00:49:58.630
<v Speaker 2>That's not what I want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's a great thing,</v>

944
00:49:58.631 --> 00:49:59.111
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

945
00:49:59.111 --> 00:50:01.180
<v Speaker 2>you have to take your great thing and go</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere else with him.</v>

946
00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:02.463
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got five minutes to mark your damn </v>

947
00:50:03.881 --> 00:50:04.990
<v Speaker 2>paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

948
00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:06.580
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

949
00:50:06.581 --> 00:50:08.440
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

950
00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:09.470
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

951
00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:10.303
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this capacity for abstraction is </v>

952
00:50:11.381 --> 00:50:12.214
<v Speaker 2>divorced almost completely from </v>
<v Speaker 2>embodiment and that's a good thing </v>

953
00:50:14.741 --> 00:50:15.574
<v Speaker 2>because that allows us to experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a bad thing because actually </v>

954
00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:21.550
<v Speaker 2>doing the embodiment turns out to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult.</v>

955
00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:22.473
<v Speaker 2>It's like your body's got all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>habits built into it that you've been </v>

956
00:50:24.911 --> 00:50:27.800
<v Speaker 2>working on for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's another piece of advice.</v>

957
00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:32.660
<v Speaker 2>Do not practice things that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to become because one of the things</v>

958
00:50:32.661 --> 00:50:33.740
<v Speaker 2>that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say</v>

959
00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:36.693
<v Speaker 2>you you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take Danish speakers and you've </v>

960
00:50:38.541 --> 00:50:39.374
<v Speaker 2>played Danish backwards to them and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>do a scan of brain activity so their </v>

961
00:50:42.621 --> 00:50:43.454
<v Speaker 2>brains lighting up like mad because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know how to listen to Danish </v>

962
00:50:45.471 --> 00:50:46.304
<v Speaker 2>backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get a whole bunch of brain </v>

963
00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:48.793
<v Speaker 2>involved in a new task,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then as you practice the task and </v>

964
00:50:53.421 --> 00:50:56.790
<v Speaker 2>routinize it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less and less brain is involved.</v>

965
00:50:56.810 --> 00:50:57.643
<v Speaker 2>So what happens is the activation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is in your standard right hand </v>

966
00:51:00.081 --> 00:51:00.914
<v Speaker 2>male and the reason I'm using that as an</v>
<v Speaker 2>example because that's the kind of </v>

967
00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:04.513
<v Speaker 2>simplest default brain in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women are more diffusely organized and </v>

968
00:51:08.061 --> 00:51:08.894
<v Speaker 2>so it's harder to exactly talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>their neurological structure and in a </v>

969
00:51:12.411 --> 00:51:14.960
<v Speaker 2>simple way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in a right handed male.</v>

970
00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:19.730
<v Speaker 2>What happens is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the activity starts to shift to the left</v>

971
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:20.833
<v Speaker 2>and then it shifts backwards and as it </v>
<v Speaker 2>does so the amount of tissue that's </v>

972
00:51:23.361 --> 00:51:27.020
<v Speaker 2>activated get smaller and smaller and </v>
<v Speaker 2>smaller and smaller until you've built a</v>

973
00:51:27.021 --> 00:51:29.900
<v Speaker 2>little machine that takes care of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of thing.</v>

974
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:32.690
<v Speaker 2>But the thing about that machine is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little machine,</v>

975
00:51:32.691 --> 00:51:36.380
<v Speaker 2>it's a habit and it's actually there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's built into you.</v>

976
00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:40.610
<v Speaker 2>So be careful what you practice because </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you practice it enough,</v>

977
00:51:40.611 --> 00:51:42.410
<v Speaker 2>then it becomes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's you,</v>

978
00:51:42.411 --> 00:51:45.950
<v Speaker 2>it's the default you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if you want to change it,</v>

979
00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:50.360
<v Speaker 2>you can't just undo that stupid machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's there permanently.</v>

980
00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:51.373
<v Speaker 2>What you have to do is you have to build</v>
<v Speaker 2>another middle machine that's shuts it </v>

981
00:51:54.141 --> 00:51:57.230
<v Speaker 2>off and then another machine that does </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other thing,</v>

982
00:51:57.231 --> 00:51:58.064
<v Speaker 2>and then if you get stressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the little machine that shuts the first </v>

983
00:51:59.841 --> 00:52:01.880
<v Speaker 2>machine off will stop working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

984
00:52:01.881 --> 00:52:04.100
<v Speaker 2>your stupid habit will come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

985
00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:05.803
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people used to talk about the </v>

986
00:52:06.981 --> 00:52:10.430
<v Speaker 2>development of character and there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>something about that that was absolutely</v>

987
00:52:10.431 --> 00:52:11.264
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because character is how you build </v>

988
00:52:13.491 --> 00:52:17.090
<v Speaker 2>yourself across time and it really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really matters.</v>

989
00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:19.990
<v Speaker 2>Only practice what you want to become.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

990
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.790
<v Speaker 2>if you practice other things developed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you'll become them.</v>

991
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.990
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not so good.</v>

992
00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:27.303
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so back to this now gray and Sokolov in </v>

993
00:52:31.421 --> 00:52:32.254
<v Speaker 2>vinegar it over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to talk about them for a </v>

994
00:52:33.041 --> 00:52:33.431
<v Speaker 2>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

995
00:52:33.431 --> 00:52:37.750
<v Speaker 2>They used to talk about animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were mostly thinking about animals,</v>

996
00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:41.140
<v Speaker 2>rats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly as having an expectancy model,</v>

997
00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:46.150
<v Speaker 2>and so you take a rat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you throw them in a new environment.</v>

998
00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:48.100
<v Speaker 2>What does he do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

999
00:52:48.101 --> 00:52:48.934
<v Speaker 2>the first thing he does is freeze </v>
<v Speaker 2>because God only knows what's out there </v>

1000
00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:55.060
<v Speaker 2>and so he's like paralyzed rat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just seen the Medusa.</v>

1001
00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:59.260
<v Speaker 2>He's paralyzed and then if nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>attacks him,</v>

1002
00:52:59.530 --> 00:53:00.363
<v Speaker 2>he starts to calm down a bit and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you start sniffing because rats are all </v>

1003
00:53:03.341 --> 00:53:08.341
<v Speaker 2>smell and he sniffs around and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to detect cats.</v>

1004
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:11.470
<v Speaker 2>Say now rats have such a good sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>smell.</v>

1005
00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:15.790
<v Speaker 2>If a rat eat something that makes it syc</v>
<v Speaker 2>will never eat it again.</v>

1006
00:53:15.791 --> 00:53:19.720
<v Speaker 2>But if a rap smells the breadth of a rat</v>
<v Speaker 2>that ate something that made him sick,</v>

1007
00:53:19.721 --> 00:53:22.000
<v Speaker 2>he won't eat that either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1008
00:53:22.001 --> 00:53:24.500
<v Speaker 2>So rats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a man,</v>

1009
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:25.543
<v Speaker 2>they can smell things so that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And animals are built around the smell </v>

1010
00:53:27.781 --> 00:53:29.430
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are a lot different than us.</v>

1011
00:53:29.431 --> 00:53:30.330
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have.</v>

1012
00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:34.590
<v Speaker 2>Did I tell you about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the t shirts study of symmetrical men.</v>

1013
00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:36.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a funny one.</v>

1014
00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:39.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we know that.</v>

1015
00:53:39.181 --> 00:53:42.150
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that signifies </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical beauty as symmetry,</v>

1016
00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:43.673
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the reason for that is that all </v>

1017
00:53:45.301 --> 00:53:46.134
<v Speaker 2>things considered symmetrical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are more healthy than </v>

1018
00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:49.913
<v Speaker 2>asymmetrical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Asymmetry indicates that something's </v>

1019
00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:55.140
<v Speaker 2>gone wrong somewhere in the process of </v>
<v Speaker 2>development.</v>

1020
00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:56.303
<v Speaker 2>So we like symmetry in beauty and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's fine and that's all the way </v>

1021
00:54:02.611 --> 00:54:04.560
<v Speaker 2>across the animal kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So butterflies,</v>

1022
00:54:04.561 --> 00:54:05.394
<v Speaker 2>there are butterflies that won't mate </v>
<v Speaker 2>with another butterfly if it deviates </v>

1023
00:54:07.801 --> 00:54:10.560
<v Speaker 2>from cemetery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some absurdly tiny amount.</v>

1024
00:54:10.561 --> 00:54:15.210
<v Speaker 2>Like really it's micro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's micro measurement deviation.</v>

1025
00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:18.250
<v Speaker 2>I guess they have a butterfly template </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you know the,</v>

1026
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:21.600
<v Speaker 2>the potential mating butterfly doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>match.</v>

1027
00:54:21.601 --> 00:54:23.290
<v Speaker 2>It's like flipped her off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1028
00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:27.270
<v Speaker 2>you're not getting anywhere so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's fine.</v>

1029
00:54:27.271 --> 00:54:29.600
<v Speaker 2>But cemetery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this researcher,</v>

1030
00:54:29.610 --> 00:54:30.443
<v Speaker 2>God only knows what possessed him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took a bunch of men ranging from </v>

1031
00:54:33.451 --> 00:54:34.970
<v Speaker 2>symmetrical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asymmetrical,</v>

1032
00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:35.813
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>judged by a panel and then he had the </v>

1033
00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:38.273
<v Speaker 2>shower and then he had them wear a tee </v>
<v Speaker 2>shirt for like four hours and then all </v>

1034
00:54:41.941 --> 00:54:42.774
<v Speaker 2>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he gave these tee shirts to </v>

1035
00:54:43.561 --> 00:54:44.520
<v Speaker 2>women and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1036
00:54:44.521 --> 00:54:45.610
<v Speaker 2>rate these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1037
00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:47.610
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the scent of the t shirt from,</v>

1038
00:54:47.611 --> 00:54:49.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive today.</v>

1039
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:50.743
<v Speaker 2>Negatives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the women overwhelmingly preferred </v>

1040
00:54:52.171 --> 00:54:54.900
<v Speaker 2>the symmetrical guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

1041
00:54:54.901 --> 00:54:55.740
<v Speaker 2>no kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1042
00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:58.050
<v Speaker 2>So you just bloody well never know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

1043
00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:00.320
<v Speaker 2>what's behind that attraction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1044
00:55:00.330 --> 00:55:02.130
<v Speaker 2>we know something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Symmetry is a big one,</v>

1045
00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:03.690
<v Speaker 2>but there's a bunch of other ones too.</v>

1046
00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:05.270
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was just wondering.</v>

1047
00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:11.440
<v Speaker 4>I know</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

1048
00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:14.630
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of things.</v>

1049
00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:16.513
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1050
00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:18.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hi,</v>

1051
00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:20.060
<v Speaker 2>here's another study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a cool one.</v>

1052
00:55:20.061 --> 00:55:24.080
<v Speaker 2>So this is one of the few psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact.</v>

1053
00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:26.540
<v Speaker 2>We don't have many psychological facts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1054
00:55:26.541 --> 00:55:28.400
<v Speaker 2>we have a lot of hypotheses about </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

1055
00:55:28.401 --> 00:55:30.890
<v Speaker 2>but this is as close to a fact as we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever gone.</v>

1056
00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:33.290
<v Speaker 2>So back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1057
00:55:33.291 --> 00:55:38.150
<v Speaker 2>decades ago the Israelis children were </v>
<v Speaker 2>raised in and those were basically,</v>

1058
00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:39.433
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were basically daycare for kids </v>

1059
00:55:43.701 --> 00:55:44.730
<v Speaker 2>group daycare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

1060
00:55:44.810 --> 00:55:45.643
<v Speaker 2>the kids were more separated from their </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents then they might be in a regular </v>

1061
00:55:48.171 --> 00:55:50.300
<v Speaker 2>daycare anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1062
00:55:50.301 --> 00:55:51.134
<v Speaker 2>the Israeli kids were in these boots and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then we have detailed marriage </v>

1063
00:55:55.011 --> 00:55:58.880
<v Speaker 2>records of the kids and so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people very seldom Mary,</v>

1064
00:55:58.910 --> 00:55:59.743
<v Speaker 2>their siblings and they're very seldomly</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a sexual relationship with their </v>

1065
00:56:03.471 --> 00:56:04.520
<v Speaker 2>siblings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>

1066
00:56:04.521 --> 00:56:05.354
<v Speaker 2>well why is that it's the case across </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultures with with very specific </v>

1067
00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:11.870
<v Speaker 2>exceptions like often high ranking </v>
<v Speaker 2>nobility can,</v>

1068
00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:14.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have an option,</v>

1069
00:56:14.090 --> 00:56:18.530
<v Speaker 2>but generally speaking there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful incest taboo as well as between</v>

1070
00:56:18.590 --> 00:56:20.510
<v Speaker 2>parents and children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1071
00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:22.403
<v Speaker 2>so some research and decided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how do you know who your sibling </v>

1072
00:56:25.421 --> 00:56:26.380
<v Speaker 2>is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1073
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:27.343
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what exactly is it that's not turning </v>

1074
00:56:31.151 --> 00:56:32.410
<v Speaker 2>you on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say?</v>

1075
00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:33.813
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they checked out the cupboard some </v>

1076
00:56:34.661 --> 00:56:35.494
<v Speaker 2>records and they found that Israeli </v>
<v Speaker 2>children who were raised in the same </v>

1077
00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:42.940
<v Speaker 2>Kabuto never married each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever happened,</v>

1078
00:56:42.941 --> 00:56:44.290
<v Speaker 2>seemed to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1079
00:56:44.291 --> 00:56:46.480
<v Speaker 2>it was as if that close,</v>
<v Speaker 2>close</v>

1080
00:56:48.370 --> 00:56:49.203
<v Speaker 2>contact in the very early years </v>
<v Speaker 2>triggered whatever the sibling anti </v>

1081
00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:55.360
<v Speaker 2>response is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was that.</v>

1082
00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:58.330
<v Speaker 2>It's probably smelled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be my guest.</v>

1083
00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:03.360
<v Speaker 2>Now there's also another study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things they found with mice,</v>

1084
00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:09.280
<v Speaker 2>I hope it's mice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that mice will not make.</v>

1085
00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:10.800
<v Speaker 2>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>

1086
00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:12.390
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to garble this up,</v>

1087
00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:15.580
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter because the point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the underlying point is valid,</v>

1088
00:57:15.581 --> 00:57:17.170
<v Speaker 2>even though I'm going to mess up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>details.</v>

1089
00:57:18.610 --> 00:57:21.460
<v Speaker 2>Animal studies indicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>

1090
00:57:21.461 --> 00:57:22.294
<v Speaker 2>that mice will not mate with other mice </v>
<v Speaker 2>who have an rh factor that would </v>

1091
00:57:27.071 --> 00:57:31.750
<v Speaker 2>increase the probability of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>miscarriage and neither will women.</v>

1092
00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:33.341
<v Speaker 2>So women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1093
00:57:33.341 --> 00:57:38.020
<v Speaker 2>not with mice obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but women women do not like the smell of</v>

1094
00:57:38.021 --> 00:57:38.854
<v Speaker 2>men who have rh factors that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>combination with theirs would produce </v>

1095
00:57:41.861 --> 00:57:43.210
<v Speaker 2>sub optimal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1096
00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:44.803
<v Speaker 2>offscreen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you ask them why they don't </v>

1097
00:57:46.331 --> 00:57:49.170
<v Speaker 2>like the smell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say it smells like my brother,</v>

1098
00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:50.890
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1099
00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:54.520
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyways,</v>

1100
00:57:54.521 --> 00:57:55.780
<v Speaker 2>that's quite remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1101
00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:58.950
<v Speaker 2>back to the rats and the expected </v>
<v Speaker 2>Seymour.</v>

1102
00:57:59.470 --> 00:58:01.420
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we already know that</v>

1103
00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:06.640
<v Speaker 2>you can get an orienting response out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a human being if something deviates from</v>

1104
00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:09.430
<v Speaker 2>expectancy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now people started studying this in rats</v>

1105
00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:13.180
<v Speaker 2>and the original conceptualization was </v>
<v Speaker 2>expectation.</v>

1106
00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:17.320
<v Speaker 2>So you have an expectation of how the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world is going to lay itself out.</v>

1107
00:58:17.410 --> 00:58:21.190
<v Speaker 2>That's your model and nanny of the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>deviates from that.</v>

1108
00:58:21.191 --> 00:58:22.024
<v Speaker 2>Then you have an orienting reflex and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the orienting reflex does is </v>

1109
00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:26.463
<v Speaker 2>protect you from predation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the first level of the orienting </v>

1110
00:58:29.861 --> 00:58:30.970
<v Speaker 2>response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>

1111
00:58:30.971 --> 00:58:31.804
<v Speaker 2>really primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's mediated only by a few neuronal </v>

1112
00:58:34.091 --> 00:58:34.924
<v Speaker 2>connections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's unbelievably rapid and then </v>

1113
00:58:36.671 --> 00:58:37.504
<v Speaker 2>after that there's anxiety and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>proclivity to explore that both gets </v>

1114
00:58:42.311 --> 00:58:46.510
<v Speaker 2>activated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's first protective.</v>

1115
00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:51.130
<v Speaker 2>Then you orient towards the managing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're walking down the street here,</v>

1116
00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:52.450
<v Speaker 2>a really loud noise behind you.</v>

1117
00:58:52.450 --> 00:58:54.490
<v Speaker 2>It's like really loud so it startles </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1118
00:58:55.050 --> 00:58:58.870
<v Speaker 2>Well you go into a crowd so that if a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tiger jumped on your back,</v>

1119
00:58:58.871 --> 00:59:02.980
<v Speaker 2>it would be hard for it to get your neck</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you know,</v>

1120
00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:03.873
<v Speaker 2>tenths of a second later you'll turn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll assuming you don't get attacked </v>

1121
00:59:06.761 --> 00:59:07.594
<v Speaker 2>by a tiger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll swivel and turn and orient all </v>

1122
00:59:10.211 --> 00:59:11.044
<v Speaker 2>your senses towards the locale that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>specified by the sound because you have </v>

1123
00:59:14.501 --> 00:59:15.334
<v Speaker 2>stereo at a stereo auditory system and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can localize events in space using </v>

1124
00:59:21.421 --> 00:59:22.610
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you already am towards it.</v>

1125
00:59:22.611 --> 00:59:25.100
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the orientation reflex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a reflex.</v>

1126
00:59:25.101 --> 00:59:25.934
<v Speaker 2>It's not voluntary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and then once you got your eyes </v>

1127
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:30.583
<v Speaker 2>trained on it and your ears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you start to explore it and then </v>

1128
00:59:33.801 --> 00:59:35.360
<v Speaker 2>you might get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might phrase,</v>

1129
00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:39.770
<v Speaker 2>you might get out of there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a panic response.</v>

1130
00:59:39.771 --> 00:59:40.604
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing that can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>triggered by the orientee reflects </v>

1131
00:59:42.171 --> 00:59:44.720
<v Speaker 2>different circuit or you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1132
00:59:44.721 --> 00:59:45.500
<v Speaker 2>what's going on over there?</v>

1133
00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:48.030
<v Speaker 2>It looks interesting and then you go </v>
<v Speaker 2>approach it.</v>

1134
00:59:48.050 --> 00:59:53.050
<v Speaker 2>Now those two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the exploratory part is mediated in part</v>

1135
00:59:54.231 --> 00:59:55.700
<v Speaker 2>by the Hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a very,</v>

1136
00:59:55.701 --> 00:59:56.534
<v Speaker 2>very old system and it has a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>section about half of it is devoted to </v>

1137
01:00:00.381 --> 01:00:01.214
<v Speaker 2>the circuitry that you would use to </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out what was going on if </v>

1138
01:00:03.471 --> 01:00:06.740
<v Speaker 2>something that you didn't understood </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened and then you have a whole other</v>

1139
01:00:06.741 --> 01:00:07.574
<v Speaker 2>circuit that's Hipaa Campbell and make </v>
<v Speaker 2>delek that regulates the exploratory </v>

1140
01:00:11.451 --> 01:00:12.284
<v Speaker 2>circuit that says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be careful because while you're </v>

1141
01:00:13.881 --> 01:00:14.714
<v Speaker 2>gathering information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might get killed and the anxiety </v>

1142
01:00:17.511 --> 01:00:21.350
<v Speaker 2>circuit takes primacy generally speaking</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the exploratory circuit,</v>

1143
01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:25.760
<v Speaker 2>and the reason for that is you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to get information and be dead.</v>

1144
01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:28.640
<v Speaker 2>So caution is the watchword.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1145
01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:30.560
<v Speaker 2>the other thing that you might think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1146
01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:33.260
<v Speaker 2>which is an extremely useful thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about,</v>

1147
01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:34.633
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go back to that diagram I showed </v>

1148
01:00:35.871 --> 01:00:37.820
<v Speaker 2>you with the hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1149
01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:38.653
<v Speaker 2>So you got the motor actions at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom and you've got the high level </v>

1150
01:00:41.451 --> 01:00:43.520
<v Speaker 2>abstractions at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1151
01:00:43.521 --> 01:00:47.750
<v Speaker 2>So you're tickling the baby and somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes home and says,</v>

1152
01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:50.870
<v Speaker 2>if you tickle the baby this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the baby has more fun.</v>

1153
01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:52.093
<v Speaker 2>And so how do you respond to that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe you're a little peeved </v>

1154
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:55.543
<v Speaker 2>because you're doing perfectly fine with</v>
<v Speaker 2>this baby and you know someone's coming </v>

1155
01:00:57.711 --> 01:01:01.370
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>altering your tickling micro personality</v>

1156
01:01:01.790 --> 01:01:03.800
<v Speaker 2>and you know if you're irritable you'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1157
01:01:03.801 --> 01:01:04.634
<v Speaker 2>well why didn't you just go off and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll find a baby of your own to play </v>

1158
01:01:06.441 --> 01:01:07.670
<v Speaker 2>with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're not,</v>

1159
01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:10.190
<v Speaker 2>and if you're not that irritable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>

1160
01:01:10.790 --> 01:01:11.623
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1161
01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:14.690
<v Speaker 2>show me what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know there'll be a tinge of negative</v>

1162
01:01:14.691 --> 01:01:16.280
<v Speaker 2>emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're generally speaking,</v>

1163
01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:18.230
<v Speaker 2>depending on how the person has </v>
<v Speaker 2>approached it,</v>

1164
01:01:18.231 --> 01:01:23.231
<v Speaker 2>but your self concept can probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>handle a micro change to you're tickling</v>

1165
01:01:24.081 --> 01:01:24.914
<v Speaker 2>routine.</v>

1166
01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:28.310
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's going to produce only a little</v>

1167
01:01:28.311 --> 01:01:29.144
<v Speaker 2>bit of anxiety and irritation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that the </v>

1168
01:01:32.091 --> 01:01:32.924
<v Speaker 2>threat to you is proportionate to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>magnitude of the system that's being </v>

1169
01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:45.200
<v Speaker 2>modified by the challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this is really useful to know,</v>

1170
01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:46.520
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>practically,</v>

1171
01:01:46.521 --> 01:01:48.620
<v Speaker 2>and this is why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's say</v>

1172
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:51.343
<v Speaker 2>you're having an argument with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>partner and you say you're a stupid </v>

1173
01:01:54.741 --> 01:01:57.800
<v Speaker 2>person and you've always been a stupid </v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

1174
01:01:57.801 --> 01:02:00.550
<v Speaker 2>and as far as I can tell as far into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>future,</v>

1175
01:02:00.551 --> 01:02:03.410
<v Speaker 2>as I can see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to remain a stupid person.</v>

1176
01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:04.933
<v Speaker 2>So what are they supposed to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are they going to do when you say </v>

1177
01:02:06.741 --> 01:02:09.260
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to cry,</v>

1178
01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:10.913
<v Speaker 2>like if you mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get angry if you mean </v>

1179
01:02:13.881 --> 01:02:17.660
<v Speaker 2>it and they don't like you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And why is that?</v>

1180
01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:19.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's.</v>

1181
01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:21.150
<v Speaker 2>It's a salt basically.</v>

1182
01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:21.983
<v Speaker 2>The only way really the only thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do in a situation like that is </v>

1183
01:02:24.721 --> 01:02:27.210
<v Speaker 2>walk away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ignore it,</v>

1184
01:02:27.211 --> 01:02:30.630
<v Speaker 2>respond in kind or in degenerates into </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence,</v>

1185
01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:33.030
<v Speaker 2>not see it because there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion.</v>

1186
01:02:33.210 --> 01:02:34.940
<v Speaker 2>You haven't left the person anywhere to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

1187
01:02:34.970 --> 01:02:38.750
<v Speaker 2>You've gotten right to the top of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy and said everything about used</v>

1188
01:02:38.751 --> 01:02:39.584
<v Speaker 2>wrong and worse than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the mechanisms that we could use to </v>

1189
01:02:42.691 --> 01:02:46.770
<v Speaker 2>correct it won't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those are fighting words,</v>

1190
01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:48.660
<v Speaker 2>so don't do that unless you want to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fight.</v>

1191
01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:51.150
<v Speaker 2>So then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what would you do instead?</v>

1192
01:02:51.210 --> 01:02:55.410
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is deliver the least </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of information you possibly can.</v>

1193
01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:56.703
<v Speaker 2>And so let's say you come home and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>person is watching tv and you were kind </v>

1194
01:03:01.101 --> 01:03:03.510
<v Speaker 2>of hoping they'd greet you at the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>

1195
01:03:03.570 --> 01:03:06.360
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't break down into tears and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say you're a stupid person.</v>

1196
01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:07.373
<v Speaker 2>You've always been a stupid person that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're couldn't be a stupid person in </v>

1197
01:03:09.271 --> 01:03:10.680
<v Speaker 2>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should say,</v>

1198
01:03:12.270 --> 01:03:13.103
<v Speaker 2>I have this peculiarity and that is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I come home I don't have enough </v>

1199
01:03:17.101 --> 01:03:21.600
<v Speaker 2>confidence to just be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like you to come and say,</v>

1200
01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:25.860
<v Speaker 2>just shut the TV off for two minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come to the front door and say hello.</v>

1201
01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:29.700
<v Speaker 2>Then you can go back and watch your TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would it be okay if you did that?</v>

1202
01:03:29.790 --> 01:03:32.070
<v Speaker 2>And they'll think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1203
01:03:32.130 --> 01:03:35.080
<v Speaker 2>you'll have to pay for it somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then they'll,</v>

1204
01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:37.380
<v Speaker 2>they'll probably do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so.</v>

1205
01:03:37.381 --> 01:03:38.214
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is you got to specify the routine that </v>

1206
01:03:40.621 --> 01:03:43.650
<v Speaker 2>you want transformed at the highest </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible level of resolution,</v>

1207
01:03:43.651 --> 01:03:44.484
<v Speaker 2>and you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to recommend the minimal </v>

1208
01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:51.210
<v Speaker 2>necessary change that will satisfy you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't say,</v>

1209
01:03:53.010 --> 01:03:55.740
<v Speaker 2>if you love me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how to greet me at the door.</v>

1210
01:03:55.830 --> 01:03:58.260
<v Speaker 2>Hi non-helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they're stupid,</v>

1211
01:03:59.370 --> 01:04:01.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So are you.</v>

1212
01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:03.240
<v Speaker 2>So you have to spell it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1213
01:04:03.241 --> 01:04:06.360
<v Speaker 2>what are you wanting to exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 2>would make you satisfied?</v>

1214
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:07.463
<v Speaker 2>And then you have to have your person </v>
<v Speaker 2>like grudgingly practice that a few </v>

1215
01:04:11.161 --> 01:04:15.630
<v Speaker 2>times and you have to let them do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>very badly and also in a bad temper.</v>

1216
01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:16.613
<v Speaker 2>And then you have to reward them for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe three months later </v>

1217
01:04:20.010 --> 01:04:20.843
<v Speaker 2>they'll do it properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you need to know that because that's </v>

1218
01:04:23.641 --> 01:04:24.474
<v Speaker 2>what people are like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard for them to learn new </v>

1219
01:04:25.921 --> 01:04:29.910
<v Speaker 2>things and they're very resistant to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're very responsive to reward.</v>

1220
01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:31.433
<v Speaker 2>So another thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is partly what bf skinner figured </v>

1221
01:04:33.841 --> 01:04:34.674
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when he was training rides and he </v>

1222
01:04:36.631 --> 01:04:37.464
<v Speaker 2>wanted to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things he would do is he put </v>

1223
01:04:39.570 --> 01:04:40.403
<v Speaker 2>maybe he was going to train the robot to</v>
<v Speaker 2>climb up a little ladder and they mean </v>

1224
01:04:44.681 --> 01:04:48.150
<v Speaker 2>he could get rats to climb ladders and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then climb across the little monkey bars</v>

1225
01:04:48.151 --> 01:04:50.160
<v Speaker 2>and then spin around three times and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>

1226
01:04:50.161 --> 01:04:50.994
<v Speaker 2>whack a ball and then eat something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>ego and incredibly complex behavior out </v>

1227
01:04:54.451 --> 01:04:55.284
<v Speaker 2>of Ras.</v>

1228
01:04:55.320 --> 01:05:00.030
<v Speaker 2>And the way he did that was patients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he put the ladder in the cage and the</v>

1229
01:05:00.031 --> 01:05:04.600
<v Speaker 2>rat would just run around doing wrap </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and then it would put its hand on</v>

1230
01:05:04.601 --> 01:05:07.710
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the first rung and skinner would give</v>

1231
01:05:07.711 --> 01:05:10.140
<v Speaker 2>it a pallet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he did,</v>

1232
01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:10.993
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after even once the rats going to be </v>

1233
01:05:13.141 --> 01:05:13.974
<v Speaker 2>like standing in the immediate vicinity </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the ladder and then the frequency </v>

1234
01:05:18.011 --> 01:05:18.844
<v Speaker 2>with which it's going to go like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just increased so that he does it </v>

1235
01:05:20.891 --> 01:05:22.150
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang Pallet.</v>

1236
01:05:22.450 --> 01:05:24.370
<v Speaker 2>Well soon the rabbit is just going like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1237
01:05:24.371 --> 01:05:25.204
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you wait until the trials the </v>

1238
01:05:27.521 --> 01:05:29.710
<v Speaker 2>other hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you give it a pellet then,</v>

1239
01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:33.000
<v Speaker 2>well then it's going like this and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's going to get bored,</v>

1240
01:05:33.001 --> 01:05:35.260
<v Speaker 2>it will go like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll hit the next stair bang.</v>

1241
01:05:35.261 --> 01:05:38.470
<v Speaker 2>You give it a pellet suiting the routes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>climbing and doing all the little things</v>

1242
01:05:38.471 --> 01:05:39.304
<v Speaker 2>you want it to do.</v>

1243
01:05:39.490 --> 01:05:41.800
<v Speaker 2>Now the problem with that is you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be patient.</v>

1244
01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:44.620
<v Speaker 2>You have to wait until the rat does what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want.</v>

1245
01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:47.140
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's more relationship advice.</v>

1246
01:05:47.350 --> 01:05:48.183
<v Speaker 2>Wait until the rock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was what you want and then reward </v>

1247
01:05:50.961 --> 01:05:55.810
<v Speaker 2>it and it's unbelievably useful and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>also extraordinarily positive.</v>

1248
01:05:55.811 --> 01:05:56.644
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm being</v>
<v Speaker 2>comical in so far as I can manage that </v>

1249
01:06:01.331 --> 01:06:02.164
<v Speaker 2>about the situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people love reward and they love </v>

1250
01:06:05.570 --> 01:06:08.320
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People love attention more than anything</v>

1251
01:06:08.321 --> 01:06:10.210
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're.</v>

1252
01:06:10.211 --> 01:06:11.044
<v Speaker 2>What will you watch through the day and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when your partner does something that's </v>

1253
01:06:14.441 --> 01:06:15.790
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say man,</v>

1254
01:06:15.791 --> 01:06:17.830
<v Speaker 2>that was good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>

1255
01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:20.560
<v Speaker 2>You can be inventive and then they'll do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it more.</v>

1256
01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:25.000
<v Speaker 2>And if you do that a whole bunch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like for a year there'll be doing things</v>

1257
01:06:25.001 --> 01:06:29.440
<v Speaker 2>that are good for you just all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to be patient,</v>

1258
01:06:29.441 --> 01:06:30.274
<v Speaker 2>which is very annoying and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>suppress your response to only respond </v>

1259
01:06:34.241 --> 01:06:36.100
<v Speaker 2>to negative things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1260
01:06:36.101 --> 01:06:39.640
<v Speaker 2>because what we know about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>expectancy models is that</v>

1261
01:06:41.490 --> 01:06:45.850
<v Speaker 2>a deviation from expectation produces a </v>
<v Speaker 2>burst of negative emotions,</v>

1262
01:06:45.851 --> 01:06:46.684
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you come home and the whole house is </v>

1263
01:06:48.191 --> 01:06:49.630
<v Speaker 2>clean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's like,</v>

1264
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:50.583
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dog has shed on the rug or </v>

1265
01:06:54.131 --> 01:06:54.520
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1266
01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:55.720
<v Speaker 2>And the person who overlooked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like,</v>

1267
01:06:55.721 --> 01:06:56.554
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to see the clean house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to see that rug with the </v>

1268
01:06:58.931 --> 01:07:00.100
<v Speaker 2>dorm for on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to say,</v>

1269
01:07:00.101 --> 01:07:02.760
<v Speaker 2>why didn't you clean up the rug with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>dog for?</v>

1270
01:07:02.770 --> 01:07:03.603
<v Speaker 2>And they're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good luck getting me to clean up the </v>

1271
01:07:05.231 --> 01:07:07.220
<v Speaker 2>house again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1272
01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:08.103
<v Speaker 2>because the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the exception stands out and what's </v>

1273
01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:12.273
<v Speaker 2>done doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is you can just </v>

1274
01:07:13.901 --> 01:07:16.900
<v Speaker 2>ignore what stuff because it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't get in your way.</v>

1275
01:07:17.050 --> 01:07:17.883
<v Speaker 2>So it gets invisible really quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you really got to watch that </v>

1276
01:07:21.701 --> 01:07:24.130
<v Speaker 2>tendency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things neat you said was that</v>

1277
01:07:24.131 --> 01:07:24.964
<v Speaker 2>if you really want to punish someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't punish them when they do </v>

1278
01:07:27.311 --> 01:07:31.360
<v Speaker 2>something wrong because they expect that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a punishment.</v>

1279
01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:33.970
<v Speaker 2>They expect that they might even be </v>
<v Speaker 2>relieved by it.</v>

1280
01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:36.640
<v Speaker 2>You want to punish them when they do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something right,</v>

1281
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:38.343
<v Speaker 2>because then you'll really hurt them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's something to think about </v>

1282
01:07:40.841 --> 01:07:42.220
<v Speaker 2>in your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're in a relationship,</v>

1283
01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:44.590
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone's done something right,</v>

1284
01:07:45.370 --> 01:07:46.203
<v Speaker 2>do not punish them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do that two or three times and </v>

1285
01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:51.100
<v Speaker 2>that's it and you're not going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>them do to do that anymore.</v>

1286
01:07:51.550 --> 01:07:55.300
<v Speaker 2>So judiciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch what they're doing.</v>

1287
01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:57.490
<v Speaker 2>If something happens that good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's good,</v>

1288
01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:00.370
<v Speaker 2>notice it and you know if they've done a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of things,</v>

1289
01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:02.710
<v Speaker 2>don't concentrate on the things they did</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

1290
01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:06.030
<v Speaker 2>That's not smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard on them too.</v>

1291
01:08:06.070 --> 01:08:07.630
<v Speaker 2>Like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In some sense,</v>

1292
01:08:07.631 --> 01:08:10.030
<v Speaker 2>this sounds manipulative and selfish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1293
01:08:10.031 --> 01:08:13.340
<v Speaker 2>because I'm teaching you how to train </v>
<v Speaker 2>your partner,</v>

1294
01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:14.393
<v Speaker 2>but you should also teach them how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>train you because it would be really </v>

1295
01:08:18.561 --> 01:08:20.570
<v Speaker 2>nice if you could come home and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person would say,</v>

1296
01:08:20.571 --> 01:08:20.740
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1297
01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:22.050
<v Speaker 2>What did you do today?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you say,</v>

1298
01:08:22.051 --> 01:08:23.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a bunch of things I did,</v>

1299
01:08:23.421 --> 01:08:24.410
<v Speaker 2>and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>

1300
01:08:24.411 --> 01:08:25.244
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this looks really good and that was </v>

1301
01:08:26.181 --> 01:08:27.560
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you do some more of that?</v>

1302
01:08:27.561 --> 01:08:28.760
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh boy,</v>

1303
01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:32.150
<v Speaker 2>it was a great day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>

1304
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:36.740
<v Speaker 2>you can train them to train you properly</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a really helpful thing,</v>

1305
01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:38.690
<v Speaker 2>especially if you do it over a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

1306
01:08:38.691 --> 01:08:39.524
<v Speaker 2>you know you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how you have a good relationship </v>

1307
01:08:41.541 --> 01:08:43.730
<v Speaker 2>because you're both clueless as hell to </v>
<v Speaker 2>begin with.</v>

1308
01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.850
<v Speaker 2>You don't know even what would make you </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy,</v>

1309
01:08:46.851 --> 01:08:48.950
<v Speaker 2>much less what would make the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>person happy.</v>

1310
01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:50.083
<v Speaker 2>And so you've got to figure these things</v>
<v Speaker 2>out bit by bit and then you have to </v>

1311
01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:57.970
<v Speaker 2>inform each other and then you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be patient enough to let your partner do</v>

1312
01:08:58.221 --> 01:09:00.860
<v Speaker 2>these things really badly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you another example.</v>

1313
01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:05.480
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes sometimes I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see couples sporadically in my,</v>

1314
01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:11.590
<v Speaker 2>in my clinical practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a couple's counselor and so,</v>

1315
01:09:11.810 --> 01:09:14.750
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes when I'm working with </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>

1316
01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:16.990
<v Speaker 2>there's an issue that needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed with,</v>

1317
01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:19.070
<v Speaker 2>with both people because otherwise it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just stupid.</v>

1318
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:22.610
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things I often recommend </v>
<v Speaker 2>to people,</v>

1319
01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:24.133
<v Speaker 2>especially once they have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that they set aside to use an </v>

1320
01:09:28.161 --> 01:09:30.410
<v Speaker 2>anachronistic phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>date,</v>

1321
01:09:30.710 --> 01:09:32.030
<v Speaker 2>date nights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1322
01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:34.400
<v Speaker 2>everyone hates that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they say,</v>

1323
01:09:34.401 --> 01:09:35.270
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1324
01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:38.180
<v Speaker 2>they'll just say that I'm not doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1325
01:09:38.210 --> 01:09:40.310
<v Speaker 2>That would be one objection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just not doing that,</v>

1326
01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:41.413
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we did before we got </v>

1327
01:09:42.591 --> 01:09:43.840
<v Speaker 2>married.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1328
01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:46.101
<v Speaker 2>they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1329
01:09:46.101 --> 01:09:46.934
<v Speaker 2>my partner would never go for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got a bunch of excuses why that </v>

1330
01:09:50.301 --> 01:09:54.380
<v Speaker 2>isn't going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I've heard all those excuses.</v>

1331
01:09:54.381 --> 01:09:56.900
<v Speaker 2>I know all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then maybe I convinced them,</v>

1332
01:09:56.901 --> 01:09:57.734
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1333
01:09:57.770 --> 01:09:58.070
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

1334
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:59.720
<v Speaker 2>I know this is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's awkward.</v>

1335
01:09:59.721 --> 01:10:00.470
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1336
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:04.700
<v Speaker 2>it's a artificial that's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just try it once.</v>

1337
01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:05.593
<v Speaker 2>So then they go and try it and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>come back and they say we had an </v>

1338
01:10:07.581 --> 01:10:09.380
<v Speaker 2>absolutely miserable kind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

1339
01:10:09.381 --> 01:10:12.500
<v Speaker 2>We had a miserable time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We couldn't agree on what movie to go to</v>

1340
01:10:12.501 --> 01:10:13.490
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1341
01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:15.720
<v Speaker 2>she took me to her movie and I really </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't like it.</v>

1342
01:10:15.721 --> 01:10:18.050
<v Speaker 2>And so we fought all the way home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're never doing that again.</v>

1343
01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:19.753
<v Speaker 2>And I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well really you've got 30 years for 100 </v>

1344
01:10:22.791 --> 01:10:24.680
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's 12,000 days.</v>

1345
01:10:24.681 --> 01:10:26.540
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're not going to do that.</v>

1346
01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:27.433
<v Speaker 2>You're going to spend the next 12,000 </v>
<v Speaker 2>days without having any real romantic </v>

1347
01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.220
<v Speaker 2>evenings and interactions with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>spouse.</v>

1348
01:10:34.221 --> 01:10:36.740
<v Speaker 2>That's your plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I liked doing,</v>

1349
01:10:37.010 --> 01:10:38.780
<v Speaker 2>I liked doing arithmetic with my </v>
<v Speaker 2>clients.</v>

1350
01:10:38.781 --> 01:10:43.430
<v Speaker 2>Say they hate that hate or if it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>

1351
01:10:43.431 --> 01:10:44.920
<v Speaker 2>that sounds like a bad idea.</v>

1352
01:10:45.010 --> 01:10:45.561
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1353
01:10:45.561 --> 01:10:47.870
<v Speaker 2>well would you like some romance in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>life?</v>

1354
01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:50.770
<v Speaker 2>Are you just done with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll really like,</v>

1355
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:51.703
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people can go for a long time with no </v>

1356
01:10:53.271 --> 01:10:54.650
<v Speaker 2>romance at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>

1357
01:10:54.651 --> 01:10:56.960
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we'd like some of that.</v>

1358
01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:59.980
<v Speaker 2>Well how much once a year?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1359
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:01.580
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once a month.</v>

1360
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:03.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1361
01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:07.280
<v Speaker 2>once every two weeks while sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are really busy,</v>

1362
01:11:07.281 --> 01:11:07.881
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1363
01:11:07.881 --> 01:11:11.210
<v Speaker 2>that beats the hell out of zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once a week,</v>

1364
01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:12.320
<v Speaker 2>twice a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1365
01:11:12.321 --> 01:11:13.550
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna we're gonna.</v>

1366
01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:14.910
<v Speaker 2>Start with a range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1367
01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:16.133
<v Speaker 2>What would a good evening look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you could both get exactly what </v>

1368
01:11:19.051 --> 01:11:19.884
<v Speaker 2>you wanted,</v>

1369
01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:22.053
<v Speaker 2>what would it look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then they have to think about that </v>

1370
01:11:23.531 --> 01:11:24.364
<v Speaker 2>because the previous theory was my </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid partner should know what I like </v>

1371
01:11:28.091 --> 01:11:30.160
<v Speaker 2>and that's what their partner is </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking too.</v>

1372
01:11:30.161 --> 01:11:31.840
<v Speaker 2>It's like good luck with that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1373
01:11:31.841 --> 01:11:33.880
<v Speaker 2>they don't have a clue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially if they're men,</v>

1374
01:11:33.881 --> 01:11:34.714
<v Speaker 2>they don't have a clue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to tell them what you want </v>

1375
01:11:37.631 --> 01:11:40.180
<v Speaker 2>and how they could deliver it and vice </v>
<v Speaker 2>versa,</v>

1376
01:11:40.181 --> 01:11:43.690
<v Speaker 2>which is very awkward and horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you have to practice it for six</v>

1377
01:11:43.691 --> 01:11:44.524
<v Speaker 2>months because you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes a lot of practice to do </v>

1378
01:11:46.841 --> 01:11:51.010
<v Speaker 2>something sophisticated really well and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then if you do that it's like poof.</v>

1379
01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:54.790
<v Speaker 2>You got it for the rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's worth the aggravation.</v>

1380
01:11:55.210 --> 01:11:58.840
<v Speaker 2>You know when the first time the rap </v>
<v Speaker 2>puts its pop on the ladder,</v>

1381
01:11:58.930 --> 01:12:01.210
<v Speaker 2>it's just sort of doing it accidentally.</v>

1382
01:12:01.630 --> 01:12:02.463
<v Speaker 2>You can't expect it to do it well and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly how to view your own </v>

1383
01:12:06.401 --> 01:12:08.230
<v Speaker 2>progress and the progress of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>partners.</v>

1384
01:12:08.231 --> 01:12:12.780
<v Speaker 2>Like let them do it badly for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least they're doing it so.</v>

1385
01:12:12.781 --> 01:12:14.350
<v Speaker 2>And if you think they should do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>faster,</v>

1386
01:12:14.370 --> 01:12:15.203
<v Speaker 2>well look real hard and see how easy it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is to change your own behavior because </v>

1387
01:12:18.071 --> 01:12:20.140
<v Speaker 2>it's really hard to change your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>

1388
01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:21.213
<v Speaker 2>Everybody says I'm going to exercise </v>
<v Speaker 2>three times a week and new year's and </v>

1389
01:12:23.771 --> 01:12:24.604
<v Speaker 2>it's like no one does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They bind the memberships and then they </v>

1390
01:12:27.491 --> 01:12:28.324
<v Speaker 2>feel guilty for having them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't actually go to the gym </v>

1391
01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:33.730
<v Speaker 2>and that's a perfect example of how </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult it is to transform behavior.</v>

1392
01:12:34.930 --> 01:12:35.763
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so back to the diagram here at </v>

1393
01:12:39.670 --> 01:12:41.530
<v Speaker 2>expectation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1394
01:12:44.490 --> 01:12:45.323
<v Speaker 2>the early models of expectation where </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive models and the idea was that </v>

1395
01:12:48.331 --> 01:12:49.164
<v Speaker 2>the rat makes a little model of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and then he operates it in that </v>

1396
01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:56.340
<v Speaker 2>world according to what he expects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there's a problem with that model.</v>

1397
01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:57.233
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first is now we know that animals </v>

1398
01:12:59.191 --> 01:13:02.790
<v Speaker 2>don't make comprehensive models of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and that's a huge problem.</v>

1399
01:13:03.210 --> 01:13:04.043
<v Speaker 2>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1400
01:13:04.050 --> 01:13:04.883
<v Speaker 2>what did they get rid of and how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the way you get rid of that problem </v>

1401
01:13:07.561 --> 01:13:08.394
<v Speaker 2>is that you introduced motivation into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the equation and it's interesting </v>

1402
01:13:11.311 --> 01:13:12.144
<v Speaker 2>because the behaviorist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I always thought of animals as blank </v>

1403
01:13:14.671 --> 01:13:18.630
<v Speaker 2>slates and so they never really took </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivation seriously as a contributor to</v>

1404
01:13:18.631 --> 01:13:23.631
<v Speaker 2>cognitive modeling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but and it's also the case that probably</v>

1405
01:13:24.001 --> 01:13:26.280
<v Speaker 2>ever since the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the enlightenment,</v>

1406
01:13:26.281 --> 01:13:27.114
<v Speaker 2>people have thought about emotion and </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivation as forced as opposed to </v>

1407
01:13:30.391 --> 01:13:31.224
<v Speaker 2>rationality.</v>

1408
01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:32.313
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you were rational in so far as you </v>

1409
01:13:33.361 --> 01:13:36.090
<v Speaker 2>didn't let your emotions and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivations influence you,</v>

1410
01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:38.220
<v Speaker 2>but that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a foolish theory.</v>

1411
01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:39.413
<v Speaker 2>There are times when it's inappropriate </v>
<v Speaker 2>for certain purposes to let certain </v>

1412
01:13:42.571 --> 01:13:44.880
<v Speaker 2>motivations interfere with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>observations,</v>

1413
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:46.103
<v Speaker 2>but generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never think about anything without </v>

1414
01:13:49.531 --> 01:13:51.390
<v Speaker 2>being motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because why would you?</v>

1415
01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:52.943
<v Speaker 2>Like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a trillion things you could </v>

1416
01:13:53.701 --> 01:13:54.900
<v Speaker 2>think of and you're not going to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

1417
01:13:54.901 --> 01:13:55.734
<v Speaker 2>Most of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have a reason to think of </v>

1418
01:13:57.661 --> 01:13:58.494
<v Speaker 2>them and the reason is is that while all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time you're operating in some sort </v>

1419
01:14:01.561 --> 01:14:02.394
<v Speaker 2>of motivational structure and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of model them using the same kind </v>

1420
01:14:05.311 --> 01:14:09.420
<v Speaker 2>of hierarchy that we used to model the </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality as such.</v>

1421
01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:11.770
<v Speaker 2>So I'll give you an example.</v>

1422
01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:19.600
<v Speaker 2>So let's think of some basic motivations</v>
<v Speaker 2>and emotions.</v>

1423
01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:21.813
<v Speaker 2>Those are good categories by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's no such thing as </v>

1424
01:14:24.341 --> 01:14:27.100
<v Speaker 2>motivations and there's no such thing as</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions.</v>

1425
01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:31.720
<v Speaker 2>The things we loosely categorize into </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivations and emotions each have their</v>

1426
01:14:31.721 --> 01:14:32.554
<v Speaker 2>own brain circuitry and so there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>similarities between them and there are </v>

1427
01:14:36.371 --> 01:14:38.170
<v Speaker 2>differences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not clean categories,</v>

1428
01:14:38.171 --> 01:14:39.004
<v Speaker 2>but we're going to use the terminology </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways because we don't have a better </v>

1429
01:14:41.171 --> 01:14:42.004
<v Speaker 2>one for my purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can roughly define a motivation as </v>

1430
01:14:46.841 --> 01:14:51.841
<v Speaker 2>opposed to a emotion as a motivation is </v>
<v Speaker 2>really something that establishes,</v>

1431
01:14:52.690 --> 01:14:54.940
<v Speaker 2>you could say a goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't.</v>

1432
01:14:54.941 --> 01:14:55.774
<v Speaker 2>It establishes one of these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't establish a goal and it </v>

1433
01:14:58.781 --> 01:15:01.690
<v Speaker 2>doesn't drive behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what it does,</v>

1434
01:15:01.691 --> 01:15:03.220
<v Speaker 2>let's say you're hungry and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>nighttime.</v>

1435
01:15:03.221 --> 01:15:04.054
<v Speaker 2>You want to have a peanut butter center,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so imagine you're sitting there typing </v>

1436
01:15:06.131 --> 01:15:06.964
<v Speaker 2>away and all of a sudden you this little</v>
<v Speaker 2>image of having something to eat creeps </v>

1437
01:15:11.711 --> 01:15:12.450
<v Speaker 2>into your head.</v>

1438
01:15:12.450 --> 01:15:13.283
<v Speaker 2>It's not usually quite specific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's there's something that you would </v>

1439
01:15:15.521 --> 01:15:17.300
<v Speaker 2>like dig so you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1440
01:15:17.310 --> 01:15:21.370
<v Speaker 2>I could really use some popcorn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say she typing away and the stupid</v>

1441
01:15:21.371 --> 01:15:25.120
<v Speaker 2>popcorn thing keeps popping up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>finally you know,</v>

1442
01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:27.880
<v Speaker 2>your whole body's starting to get into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the popcorn and you think,</v>

1443
01:15:27.881 --> 01:15:28.571
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hell with it.</v>

1444
01:15:28.571 --> 01:15:29.404
<v Speaker 2>I'll go make some popcorn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what's happened is that your </v>

1445
01:15:32.381 --> 01:15:34.090
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>

1446
01:15:34.091 --> 01:15:34.924
<v Speaker 2>has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is monitoring your internal body state </v>

1447
01:15:36.491 --> 01:15:38.920
<v Speaker 2>and it thinks that you need some maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>need some salt,</v>

1448
01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:43.990
<v Speaker 2>but maybe you need some folk and so it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna start popping up,</v>

1449
01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:45.303
<v Speaker 2>not a dry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like all of a sudden you're a </v>

1450
01:15:46.661 --> 01:15:47.430
<v Speaker 2>robot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1451
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:52.430
<v Speaker 2>like a popcorn and seeking robot and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're laying out your chained together.</v>

1452
01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:57.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm conditioned popcorn making and </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating routines.</v>

1453
01:15:57.131 --> 01:15:57.964
<v Speaker 2>That isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens is that what happens </v>

1454
01:15:59.771 --> 01:16:00.604
<v Speaker 2>instead is that you start to envision a </v>
<v Speaker 2>new state of being and that state of </v>

1455
01:16:04.811 --> 01:16:05.644
<v Speaker 2>being has a goal which is you eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>some popcorn and it has you where you </v>

1456
01:16:08.951 --> 01:16:09.784
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is in an insufficient state of </v>

1457
01:16:11.090 --> 01:16:11.923
<v Speaker 2>popcorn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then what's happening as well is </v>

1458
01:16:14.051 --> 01:16:15.430
<v Speaker 2>that this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1459
01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:16.713
<v Speaker 2>the motor processes that you would use </v>
<v Speaker 2>to implement that are also disinhibited </v>

1460
01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:23.320
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1461
01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:25.700
<v Speaker 2>There you already know how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get disinhibited,</v>

1462
01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:27.910
<v Speaker 2>so or you could think of them as getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>primed.</v>

1463
01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:29.830
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting disinhibited,</v>

1464
01:16:29.831 --> 01:16:30.664
<v Speaker 2>but you can think of it as being primed </v>
<v Speaker 2>and at some point that becomes </v>

1465
01:16:33.551 --> 01:16:37.570
<v Speaker 2>overwhelmingly overwhelming enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say pressure from the Hypothalamus,</v>

1466
01:16:37.571 --> 01:16:40.120
<v Speaker 2>which is really what's bloody well in </v>
<v Speaker 2>control says,</v>

1467
01:16:40.121 --> 01:16:40.780
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1468
01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:45.780
<v Speaker 2>enough like Internet surfing off to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>popcorn and so you leap up and then what</v>

1469
01:16:45.891 --> 01:16:46.724
<v Speaker 2>do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You reorient the way you're looking at </v>

1470
01:16:47.921 --> 01:16:48.754
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything in the world becomes low </v>

1471
01:16:50.441 --> 01:16:51.274
<v Speaker 2>resolution or even zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except those few things that are </v>

1472
01:16:54.551 --> 01:16:57.220
<v Speaker 2>relevant to your new quest down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stairs.</v>

1473
01:16:57.221 --> 01:16:59.050
<v Speaker 2>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find the right pen,</v>

1474
01:16:59.110 --> 01:17:02.710
<v Speaker 2>you find the popcorn getting irritated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can't find it right,</v>

1475
01:17:02.711 --> 01:17:03.544
<v Speaker 2>because now you see it's interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>because your emotions align along your </v>

1476
01:17:07.031 --> 01:17:07.864
<v Speaker 2>goals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As long as you're pursuing a beeline to </v>

1477
01:17:10.761 --> 01:17:13.490
<v Speaker 2>your goal and everything's laying itself</v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

1478
01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:16.850
<v Speaker 2>not as you expect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as you want,</v>

1479
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:20.540
<v Speaker 2>then your emotions stay positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as something deviates,</v>

1480
01:17:20.541 --> 01:17:21.680
<v Speaker 2>then you're irritated.</v>

1481
01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:25.430
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that like </v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you can't find the popcorn pad</v>

1482
01:17:26.150 --> 01:17:27.740
<v Speaker 2>while your brain is computing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1483
01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:31.220
<v Speaker 2>something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is obviously not how it works,</v>

1484
01:17:31.221 --> 01:17:32.054
<v Speaker 2>but it's an x amount of energy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter from popcorn means it has x </v>

1485
01:17:37.041 --> 01:17:37.874
<v Speaker 2>value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you expand a whole bunch of energy </v>

1486
01:17:40.581 --> 01:17:45.510
<v Speaker 2>running around in your clueless state </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to acquire popcorn,</v>

1487
01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:46.373
<v Speaker 2>you can easily get to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've expended more energy and time </v>

1488
01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:52.190
<v Speaker 2>than the popcorn delivers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you do that for a month,</v>

1489
01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:53.630
<v Speaker 2>then you die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1490
01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:54.993
<v Speaker 2>So it's perfectly reasonable for you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get irritated when the path links to </v>

1491
01:17:58.461 --> 01:18:03.080
<v Speaker 2>your destination increases radically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you might get even more irritated if</v>

1492
01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:05.240
<v Speaker 2>you can't find any popcorn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's like,</v>

1493
01:18:05.241 --> 01:18:06.074
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to dispense with the popcorn </v>

1494
01:18:07.881 --> 01:18:10.880
<v Speaker 2>micro personality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's all irritated because you know,</v>

1495
01:18:10.881 --> 01:18:11.714
<v Speaker 2>it sort of alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's irritated that you have to squash </v>

1496
01:18:13.551 --> 01:18:14.384
<v Speaker 2>it and then you have to come up with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe I could have a peanut butter </v>

1497
01:18:16.191 --> 01:18:17.410
<v Speaker 2>sandwich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1498
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:18.343
<v Speaker 2>pop up comes a new little micro </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality that orients itself towards </v>

1499
01:18:21.771 --> 01:18:22.604
<v Speaker 2>the goal.</v>

1500
01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:26.540
<v Speaker 2>And so all the time you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're always in a motivated state.</v>

1501
01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:31.700
<v Speaker 2>Now it's not a drive because it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>deterministic,</v>

1502
01:18:32.330 --> 01:18:33.163
<v Speaker 2>but it does have a behavioral element.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have all these [inaudible] and sub </v>

1503
01:18:36.231 --> 01:18:38.630
<v Speaker 2>routines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're are stored in your body,</v>

1504
01:18:38.631 --> 01:18:39.464
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all your,</v>

1505
01:18:39.570 --> 01:18:40.403
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body capacity or your skills and </v>

1506
01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:44.413
<v Speaker 2>you know which set of those you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>likely to use if you're going to do x </v>

1507
01:18:47.421 --> 01:18:49.370
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so those get prepared.</v>

1508
01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:54.080
<v Speaker 2>And then your perceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real orient towards the new goal.</v>

1509
01:18:54.081 --> 01:18:56.750
<v Speaker 2>It's like a hunting goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fixated on it.</v>

1510
01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:00.410
<v Speaker 2>Then your emotions orient long that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as long as things are going well,</v>

1511
01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:02.630
<v Speaker 2>you're happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're hopeful.</v>

1512
01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:04.490
<v Speaker 2>Things are proceeding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's positive emotion,</v>

1513
01:19:04.491 --> 01:19:05.060
<v Speaker 2>that's dope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1514
01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:05.893
<v Speaker 2>energetically mediated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if things aren't going well that </v>

1515
01:19:07.731 --> 01:19:08.960
<v Speaker 2>it's either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1516
01:19:08.961 --> 01:19:09.794
<v Speaker 2>it's any amount of negative emotion for </v>
<v Speaker 2>mild irritation to like full blown </v>

1517
01:19:12.471 --> 01:19:13.304
<v Speaker 2>temper tantrum.</v>

1518
01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:15.200
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's.</v>

1519
01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:18.020
<v Speaker 2>And you're okay now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the simple story.</v>

1520
01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:21.590
<v Speaker 2>The complex story is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1521
01:19:21.591 --> 01:19:23.210
<v Speaker 2>you're hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're thirsty,</v>

1522
01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:24.920
<v Speaker 2>you're tired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're hot,</v>

1523
01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:26.840
<v Speaker 2>you're cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're lonely,</v>

1524
01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:28.700
<v Speaker 2>you need to play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1525
01:19:28.701 --> 01:19:30.980
<v Speaker 2>So let's say you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the sake of argument,</v>

1526
01:19:30.981 --> 01:19:33.920
<v Speaker 2>let's say you have eight fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivational systems.</v>

1527
01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:38.600
<v Speaker 2>Now who cares how many?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a finite set under 20.</v>

1528
01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:41.000
<v Speaker 2>It depends on whether you include anger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is anger,</v>

1529
01:19:41.001 --> 01:19:44.000
<v Speaker 2>motivation or emotion is pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivation or emotion?</v>

1530
01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:47.680
<v Speaker 2>We don't care because they're not formal</v>
<v Speaker 2>categories.</v>

1531
01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:50.060
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this,</v>

1532
01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:51.680
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a set number of them,</v>

1533
01:19:52.130 --> 01:19:56.330
<v Speaker 2>and then so they have to run to </v>
<v Speaker 2>satiation.</v>

1534
01:19:57.050 --> 01:19:59.810
<v Speaker 2>And so what satiation means is they set </v>
<v Speaker 2>up an end state.</v>

1535
01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:02.840
<v Speaker 2>You perform the routines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you achieve the end state,</v>

1536
01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:05.480
<v Speaker 2>the system shuts down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's satiated.</v>

1537
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:08.010
<v Speaker 2>Now you'll experience that as </v>
<v Speaker 2>satisfaction,</v>

1538
01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:11.100
<v Speaker 2>not as pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you think,</v>

1539
01:20:11.101 --> 01:20:12.090
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the difference?</v>

1540
01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:12.750
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1541
01:20:12.750 --> 01:20:13.583
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1542
01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:14.780
<v Speaker 2>it's tight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1543
01:20:14.930 --> 01:20:17.100
<v Speaker 2>it's complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's important.</v>

1544
01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:19.373
<v Speaker 2>The kind of positive emotion that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>really like is associated with the </v>

1545
01:20:22.081 --> 01:20:25.470
<v Speaker 2>search and the hope not with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>acquiree,</v>

1546
01:20:25.950 --> 01:20:27.690
<v Speaker 2>because what happens when you acquire </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1547
01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:30.120
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're no longer in this state,</v>

1548
01:20:30.121 --> 01:20:32.630
<v Speaker 2>which has a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1549
01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:36.060
<v Speaker 2>an impulse to action in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's exciting.</v>

1550
01:20:36.061 --> 01:20:36.880
<v Speaker 2>That's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1551
01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:37.713
<v Speaker 2>you're on the track of something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're alive while you're </v>

1552
01:20:39.451 --> 01:20:41.460
<v Speaker 2>searching for something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you find it.</v>

1553
01:20:41.461 --> 01:20:42.001
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

1554
01:20:42.001 --> 01:20:44.430
<v Speaker 2>you need to find it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then the whole thing disappears.</v>

1555
01:20:44.431 --> 01:20:46.260
<v Speaker 2>And you're sitting there thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1556
01:20:46.261 --> 01:20:49.560
<v Speaker 2>I've just graduated now what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1557
01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:51.270
<v Speaker 2>Because that's what will happen when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>graduate.</v>

1558
01:20:51.271 --> 01:20:51.811
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1559
01:20:51.811 --> 01:20:53.460
<v Speaker 2>you're a student,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got status,</v>

1560
01:20:53.461 --> 01:20:57.120
<v Speaker 2>you've got a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got a hierarchy of values,</v>

1561
01:20:57.121 --> 01:21:00.900
<v Speaker 2>you've got a way of orienting yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world and you have an identity.</v>

1562
01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:02.280
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're,</v>

1563
01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:03.960
<v Speaker 2>you're in there and everybody's happy </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

1564
01:21:03.961 --> 01:21:06.340
<v Speaker 2>So then one day you graduates like </v>
<v Speaker 2>success.</v>

1565
01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:07.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really it was like,</v>

1566
01:21:08.010 --> 01:21:09.330
<v Speaker 2>poof,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's gone.</v>

1567
01:21:09.331 --> 01:21:10.164
<v Speaker 2>And the next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like handing out coffee at the </v>

1568
01:21:12.541 --> 01:21:15.260
<v Speaker 2>local starbucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you're doing,</v>

1569
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:16.103
<v Speaker 2>you get the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've experienced this all the time in </v>

1570
01:21:17.341 --> 01:21:18.570
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You hit a pinnacle,</v>

1571
01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:21.780
<v Speaker 2>you've attained something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is is that</v>

1572
01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:26.670
<v Speaker 2>now what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to conjure up a whole new you,</v>

1573
01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:30.240
<v Speaker 2>so some of it is sat satisfying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've accomplished the goal,</v>

1574
01:21:30.241 --> 01:21:32.160
<v Speaker 2>but some of it's just a big pain in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>neck.</v>

1575
01:21:32.161 --> 01:21:33.210
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1576
01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:38.240
<v Speaker 2>student me is disappeared and now it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>frantically searching for employment me,</v>

1577
01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:43.470
<v Speaker 2>and that means doesn't have the status </v>
<v Speaker 2>and and it is in this space,</v>

1578
01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:46.350
<v Speaker 2>a much more radical uncertainty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1579
01:21:46.650 --> 01:21:47.483
<v Speaker 2>so don't be thinking that getting that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting to where you want to go is what </v>

1580
01:21:50.671 --> 01:21:51.504
<v Speaker 2>you want.</v>

1581
01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:55.500
<v Speaker 2>What you want is to bloody well make </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure that the voyage is worth it.</v>

1582
01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:59.430
<v Speaker 2>Now and it's very interesting because </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are really,</v>

1583
01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:00.593
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really wired up this way and I think </v>

1584
01:22:02.611 --> 01:22:04.770
<v Speaker 2>it's because we're so radically </v>
<v Speaker 2>exploratory,</v>

1585
01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:06.383
<v Speaker 2>so when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're proceeding towards a valued </v>

1586
01:22:09.961 --> 01:22:13.080
<v Speaker 2>goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's call that a cue,</v>

1587
01:22:13.081 --> 01:22:17.250
<v Speaker 2>that goal attainment is about to occur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to occur in some chain.</v>

1588
01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:20.700
<v Speaker 2>A leads to b leads to c leads to d and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so on.</v>

1589
01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:23.520
<v Speaker 2>That's your like a hound on a trail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1590
01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:24.870
<v Speaker 2>it's positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1591
01:22:24.871 --> 01:22:25.670
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is working.</v>

1592
01:22:25.670 --> 01:22:26.431
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is working.</v>

1593
01:22:26.431 --> 01:22:27.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is working.</v>

1594
01:22:27.390 --> 01:22:29.370
<v Speaker 2>That's positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's moving you in hand,</v>

1595
01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:32.190
<v Speaker 2>and that's really where you experienced </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of your positive emotion.</v>

1596
01:22:32.250 --> 01:22:33.960
<v Speaker 2>That's dope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Up near GP mediated.</v>

1597
01:22:34.290 --> 01:22:35.123
<v Speaker 2>That's the system you'll kick with </v>
<v Speaker 2>cocaine or any of the other drugs of </v>

1598
01:22:38.011 --> 01:22:42.000
<v Speaker 2>abuse that people use that don't put </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety.</v>

1599
01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:46.320
<v Speaker 2>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very desirable motivational state.</v>

1600
01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:47.573
<v Speaker 2>I read a while back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody who said you can buy anything </v>

1601
01:22:50.281 --> 01:22:51.114
<v Speaker 2>but you can't buy wanting anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a staggeringly interesting </v>

1602
01:22:56.281 --> 01:22:57.660
<v Speaker 2>comment because you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1603
01:22:57.870 --> 01:23:01.380
<v Speaker 2>you know he's wanting a positive state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you don't have it,</v>

1604
01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:04.020
<v Speaker 2>so that's kind of annoying and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

1605
01:23:04.021 --> 01:23:05.230
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to launch things.</v>

1606
01:23:05.231 --> 01:23:06.370
<v Speaker 2>I want to have them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1607
01:23:06.371 --> 01:23:09.130
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't be so sure about that.</v>

1608
01:23:10.210 --> 01:23:11.043
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the ways people have figured out </v>

1609
01:23:12.491 --> 01:23:13.324
<v Speaker 2>how to deal with that is that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>decided to want something that they </v>

1610
01:23:15.191 --> 01:23:16.024
<v Speaker 2>can't get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually extraordinarily </v>

1611
01:23:18.071 --> 01:23:20.670
<v Speaker 2>smart and it's a deep archetypal idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here,</v>

1612
01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:23.080
<v Speaker 2>here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've Seen Pinocchio,</v>

1613
01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:25.000
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1614
01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:25.863
<v Speaker 2>So Nokia was about a puppet marionette.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that mean someone else is pulling </v>

1615
01:23:29.561 --> 01:23:31.060
<v Speaker 2>the strings?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1616
01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:34.510
<v Speaker 2>We don't know who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it's virtually Satan himself.</v>

1617
01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:39.130
<v Speaker 2>You remember the Stromboli?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's another character just after him</v>

1618
01:23:39.140 --> 01:23:41.710
<v Speaker 2>is the coachman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the coachman.</v>

1619
01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:46.450
<v Speaker 2>He's like King of the thieves and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>ends up pulling Pinocchio strikes.</v>

1620
01:23:46.810 --> 01:23:47.643
<v Speaker 2>So there's one scene in the Disney movie</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the coachman reveals himself and </v>

1621
01:23:52.061 --> 01:23:54.220
<v Speaker 2>he's completely ready,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is really big teeth.</v>

1622
01:23:54.490 --> 01:23:55.323
<v Speaker 2>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a satanic figure and he scares the </v>

1623
01:23:56.861 --> 01:23:57.694
<v Speaker 2>Fox and the cat who are like low level </v>
<v Speaker 2>criminals who think they're bad but you </v>

1624
01:24:00.730 --> 01:24:02.440
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have never really met bad.</v>

1625
01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:04.300
<v Speaker 2>He just scares that right into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>corner.</v>

1626
01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:05.493
<v Speaker 2>And so it's all of a sudden this person </v>
<v Speaker 2>opens up and reveals the architect </v>

1627
01:24:08.261 --> 01:24:11.800
<v Speaker 2>behind and then closes back down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pulling Pinocchio strengths.</v>

1628
01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:14.230
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now he's a married man.</v>

1629
01:24:14.290 --> 01:24:15.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1630
01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:18.790
<v Speaker 2>the first question that arises is who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>pulling your strings?</v>

1631
01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:22.240
<v Speaker 2>And that's a really good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things young said was,</v>

1632
01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:25.540
<v Speaker 2>people don't have ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ideas have people.</v>

1633
01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:28.330
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can think about that for about three</v>

1634
01:24:28.331 --> 01:24:32.680
<v Speaker 2>months and it should make you afraid the</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole time because as soon as you,</v>

1635
01:24:32.890 --> 01:24:35.080
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you get that,</v>

1636
01:24:35.081 --> 01:24:35.914
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1637
01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:37.773
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like let's say you're an idiot log of </v>

1638
01:24:38.981 --> 01:24:39.814
<v Speaker 2>some sort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because some of you probably are </v>

1639
01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:45.490
<v Speaker 2>Socialists Fascist environmentalist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that has just on the end.</v>

1640
01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:48.100
<v Speaker 2>It's like you think those are your </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>

1641
01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:52.870
<v Speaker 2>They're not your they're tools and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

1642
01:24:52.871 --> 01:24:55.360
<v Speaker 2>If you want to be a tool of those ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go right ahead,</v>

1643
01:24:55.361 --> 01:24:56.194
<v Speaker 2>but you don't know where those ideas are</v>
<v Speaker 2>leading and they could well be leading </v>

1644
01:25:00.491 --> 01:25:01.750
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do not want to go.</v>

1645
01:25:01.751 --> 01:25:02.584
<v Speaker 2>Now the plus side is you don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take any responsibility for it because </v>

1646
01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:05.673
<v Speaker 2>you know you're just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just drifting in an ocean of </v>

1647
01:25:07.781 --> 01:25:08.614
<v Speaker 2>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things that I learned </v>

1648
01:25:10.511 --> 01:25:11.344
<v Speaker 2>from young was you should figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>just exactly which ideas are possessing </v>

1649
01:25:13.991 --> 01:25:14.824
<v Speaker 2>you and then you should decide if those </v>
<v Speaker 2>are your ideas and the probability that </v>

1650
01:25:18.521 --> 01:25:19.540
<v Speaker 2>they are a zero.</v>

1651
01:25:19.870 --> 01:25:23.200
<v Speaker 2>They're not your ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to have your own ideas.</v>

1652
01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:25.660
<v Speaker 2>You have to derive them from your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

1653
01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:27.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you,</v>

1654
01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:30.460
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're not very old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have that much experience,</v>

1655
01:25:30.461 --> 01:25:31.294
<v Speaker 2>and so you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can grab books full of ideas and </v>

1656
01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:37.180
<v Speaker 2>claim them for your own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not acceptable.</v>

1657
01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:40.480
<v Speaker 2>You can use those ideas to inform your </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas,</v>

1658
01:25:40.810 --> 01:25:43.720
<v Speaker 2>but they're not your ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just a puppet,</v>

1659
01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:45.093
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Pinocchio movie is very </v>

1660
01:25:45.641 --> 01:25:46.474
<v Speaker 2>interesting that way because he's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>puppet of forces that are really not on </v>

1661
01:25:49.811 --> 01:25:51.160
<v Speaker 2>his side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seriously.</v>

1662
01:25:51.161 --> 01:25:53.020
<v Speaker 2>No one on his side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1663
01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:53.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

1664
01:25:53.830 --> 01:25:56.560
<v Speaker 2>back to the Pinocchio Movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give me one sec.</v>

1665
01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:59.980
<v Speaker 2>So Japan doesn't have a son now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan was a good guy,</v>

1666
01:25:59.981 --> 01:26:00.651
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1667
01:26:00.651 --> 01:26:02.980
<v Speaker 2>Tony Maker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got this little warm cabin.</v>

1668
01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:05.030
<v Speaker 2>It's cozy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a good guy,</v>

1669
01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:07.100
<v Speaker 2>he's friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has a little cat.</v>

1670
01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:09.920
<v Speaker 2>He pays attention to his little fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She takes care of that.</v>

1671
01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:12.800
<v Speaker 2>So we know Japan is a good guy and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes this property.</v>

1672
01:26:12.801 --> 01:26:14.810
<v Speaker 2>Thanks band.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a puppet,</v>

1673
01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:16.850
<v Speaker 2>but maybe I'd rather have something </v>
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>

1674
01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:17.893
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question for parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to pop it or do you want </v>

1675
01:26:20.721 --> 01:26:23.600
<v Speaker 2>something real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And answer is generally,</v>

1676
01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:26.480
<v Speaker 2>often all just have a puppet as long as </v>
<v Speaker 2>it does exactly what it.</v>

1677
01:26:26.490 --> 01:26:27.323
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it be a medical school puppet </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's certainly one good form </v>

1678
01:26:30.561 --> 01:26:33.540
<v Speaker 2>of puppet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>

1679
01:26:33.541 --> 01:26:34.320
<v Speaker 2>so Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1680
01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:35.960
<v Speaker 2>decides because he's a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thinks,</v>

1681
01:26:35.961 --> 01:26:36.261
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1682
01:26:36.261 --> 01:26:39.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't want this thing to have strings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want it to be its own thing.</v>

1683
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:41.660
<v Speaker 2>I want it to be a tournament's </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual.</v>

1684
01:26:41.661 --> 01:26:42.740
<v Speaker 2>Real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1685
01:26:42.741 --> 01:26:44.840
<v Speaker 2>So what does he do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wishes,</v>

1686
01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:48.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does he wish on a star?</v>

1687
01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Why do people wish on stars of all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy things?</v>

1688
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:54.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a divine thing,</v>

1689
01:26:54.231 --> 01:26:55.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a divine thing.</v>

1690
01:26:55.461 --> 01:26:57.140
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all.</v>

1691
01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:58.273
<v Speaker 2>It's the infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go out at night and you see the </v>

1692
01:27:00.651 --> 01:27:01.970
<v Speaker 2>stars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you can't in the city,</v>

1693
01:27:01.971 --> 01:27:06.380
<v Speaker 2>but you go out somewhere dark and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see the stars and it's like it's you and</v>

1694
01:27:06.381 --> 01:27:08.060
<v Speaker 2>the infinite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it really is.</v>

1695
01:27:08.330 --> 01:27:09.163
<v Speaker 2>It's a perfect representation of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with the infinite because </v>

1696
01:27:13.370 --> 01:27:15.830
<v Speaker 2>the university is about as an infant as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you need,</v>

1697
01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:19.610
<v Speaker 2>and it's going to give you a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>awe and that's partly why archaic people</v>

1698
01:27:19.611 --> 01:27:22.340
<v Speaker 2>thought that God was in the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's not.</v>

1699
01:27:22.430 --> 01:27:24.080
<v Speaker 2>They weren't stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people,</v>

1700
01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:28.630
<v Speaker 2>they thought God is what fills you with </v>
<v Speaker 2>awe.</v>

1701
01:27:29.090 --> 01:27:31.520
<v Speaker 2>So you look at the guy and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1702
01:27:31.521 --> 01:27:35.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something and it's an.</v>

1703
01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:38.720
<v Speaker 2>It's an instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a cognitive construction.</v>

1704
01:27:38.721 --> 01:27:39.554
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you aim at it starts this twinkling </v>

1705
01:27:41.511 --> 01:27:42.770
<v Speaker 2>thing in the darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1706
01:27:42.770 --> 01:27:45.260
<v Speaker 2>It's the light in the darkness and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>above.</v>

1707
01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:50.950
<v Speaker 2>It's above the worldly environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something transcendent,</v>

1708
01:27:51.710 --> 01:27:53.380
<v Speaker 2>and so that's what you better wishes on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1709
01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:57.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to aim high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what he says.</v>

1710
01:27:57.110 --> 01:27:58.790
<v Speaker 2>Aim High and he thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1711
01:27:58.791 --> 01:28:00.980
<v Speaker 2>it's not very likely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I might as well aim high.</v>

1712
01:28:01.730 --> 01:28:06.080
<v Speaker 2>That's a very good piece of advice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to aim so high you can't attain</v>

1713
01:28:06.081 --> 01:28:08.380
<v Speaker 2>it because then you've got something </v>
<v Speaker 2>worth it might be.</v>

1714
01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:09.223
<v Speaker 2>Think that's such perverse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's such a perverse per piece of </v>

1715
01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:13.033
<v Speaker 2>advice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's why would you chase something you </v>

1716
01:28:14.031 --> 01:28:15.620
<v Speaker 2>can't have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1717
01:28:15.621 --> 01:28:16.454
<v Speaker 2>the answer might be because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chasing is worth it and then you might </v>

1718
01:28:21.231 --> 01:28:21.621
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1719
01:28:21.621 --> 01:28:22.580
<v Speaker 2>what's worth it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1720
01:28:22.581 --> 01:28:27.290
<v Speaker 2>I can give you a hint about that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like develop your character because</v>

1721
01:28:27.291 --> 01:28:29.960
<v Speaker 2>what you've got is what you carry with </v>
<v Speaker 2>you wherever you go,</v>

1722
01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:34.820
<v Speaker 2>and it's way better to be able to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>things than to be rich because if you're</v>

1723
01:28:34.821 --> 01:28:36.710
<v Speaker 2>rich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then that disappears.</v>

1724
01:28:36.710 --> 01:28:37.543
<v Speaker 2>Poof,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're poor.</v>

1725
01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:38.623
<v Speaker 2>But if you can do things short of being </v>
<v Speaker 2>demolished and even then people are </v>

1726
01:28:42.681 --> 01:28:44.330
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable and overcoming those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1727
01:28:44.331 --> 01:28:47.660
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're on the way.</v>

1728
01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Here's an interesting experiment we did </v>
<v Speaker 2>with with undergraduate women,</v>

1729
01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:54.740
<v Speaker 2>so there's this idea in evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology.</v>

1730
01:28:55.610 --> 01:28:59.360
<v Speaker 2>It's called hyperthermia and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hyperthermia is the tendency of women to</v>

1731
01:28:59.361 --> 01:29:02.790
<v Speaker 2>choose mates who are slightly older than</v>
<v Speaker 2>them on it's about four years on average</v>

1732
01:29:02.791 --> 01:29:07.791
<v Speaker 2>cross culturally and who are higher in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the status hierarchy than they are.</v>

1733
01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:09.593
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very well documented tendency and </v>

1734
01:29:11.850 --> 01:29:16.410
<v Speaker 2>people who are cynical about that think </v>
<v Speaker 2>women want wealth and I thought,</v>

1735
01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:18.180
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a bad theory because it kind of</v>

1736
01:29:18.181 --> 01:29:20.820
<v Speaker 2>evens the scales.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're going to have a family,</v>

1737
01:29:20.970 --> 01:29:21.803
<v Speaker 2>you're basically a chimpanzee baby </v>
<v Speaker 2>clings to its mother's for for 5,000 </v>

1738
01:29:27.481 --> 01:29:28.314
<v Speaker 2>miles in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the three or four years that it's </v>

1739
01:29:30.121 --> 01:29:30.930
<v Speaker 2>doing the clinging.</v>

1740
01:29:30.930 --> 01:29:32.670
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's a major league </v>
<v Speaker 2>impediment,</v>

1741
01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:34.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you're a new mother,</v>

1742
01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:35.933
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life is so much more complicated </v>

1743
01:29:37.711 --> 01:29:38.544
<v Speaker 2>than it is when you're a single that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not even the same conceptual </v>

1744
01:29:40.831 --> 01:29:41.664
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a major league responsibility and </v>

1745
01:29:45.211 --> 01:29:47.070
<v Speaker 2>it slows you down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you might think,</v>

1746
01:29:47.071 --> 01:29:47.904
<v Speaker 2>well the logical thing to do would be to</v>
<v Speaker 2>balance the scales a little bit and </v>

1747
01:29:50.071 --> 01:29:51.570
<v Speaker 2>that's perfectly reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I thought,</v>

1748
01:29:51.571 --> 01:29:53.250
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet your women are smarter than that.</v>

1749
01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:54.773
<v Speaker 2>I bet you can fool them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the pickup artists do that all the </v>

1750
01:29:57.811 --> 01:30:02.420
<v Speaker 2>time because they mimic status.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

1751
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.380
<v Speaker 2>you can follow them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not.</v>

1752
01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:06.060
<v Speaker 2>They're smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what we did,</v>

1753
01:30:06.630 --> 01:30:08.640
<v Speaker 2>I never published this be for a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons,</v>

1754
01:30:08.641 --> 01:30:10.740
<v Speaker 2>but okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what we did was we took,</v>

1755
01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:13.130
<v Speaker 2>we took pictures of the same guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1756
01:30:13.170 --> 01:30:14.970
<v Speaker 2>just kind of an average looking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's all right.</v>

1757
01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:20.430
<v Speaker 2>And we had four stories about them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>one story was a poor,</v>

1758
01:30:20.431 --> 01:30:22.590
<v Speaker 2>useless guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an easy story,</v>

1759
01:30:22.591 --> 01:30:23.424
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1760
01:30:23.610 --> 01:30:25.590
<v Speaker 2>sits on his couch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plays video games.</v>

1761
01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:27.390
<v Speaker 2>Each cheetos covered with dust.</v>
