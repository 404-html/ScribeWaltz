1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.310
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to tell you a story now</v>

2
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.210
<v Speaker 1>and it has these characters in it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so this is a very important story.</v>

3
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.323
<v Speaker 1>It's called the Enuma elish and it's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamian creation myth and it's </v>

4
00:00:17.491 --> 00:00:19.830
<v Speaker 1>important for a bunch of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

5
00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:21.540
<v Speaker 1>it's the oldest written story we know </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

6
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.890
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a Middle Eastern story and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole,</v>

7
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.273
<v Speaker 1>all the abrahamic religions emerged out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Middle East and so it's a </v>

8
00:00:34.141 --> 00:00:34.974
<v Speaker 1>foundational story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a story that sits at the bottom of </v>

9
00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:39.840
<v Speaker 1>our culture now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has.</v>

10
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.400
<v Speaker 1>It has similarities to the creation </v>
<v Speaker 1>story in genesis,</v>

11
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.010
<v Speaker 1>whether the creation story in genesis </v>
<v Speaker 1>was derived from it or whether there was</v>

12
00:00:50.011 --> 00:00:50.844
<v Speaker 1>a whole variety of similar stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>floating around in the Middle East and </v>

13
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.780
<v Speaker 1>at the same time that we're very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a theme we don't really know,</v>

14
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.340
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it really matters.</v>

15
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.133
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how old the story is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know how old it is and it's written </v>

16
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.700
<v Speaker 1>form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

17
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:11.653
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's thousands of years old and it's </v>

18
00:01:13.431 --> 00:01:16.560
<v Speaker 1>written for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's 10,000 years old.</v>

19
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.930
<v Speaker 1>It's written for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but probably not.</v>

20
00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:18.764
<v Speaker 1>It's probably more like 5,000 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is is that a 5,000 year </v>

21
00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:26.990
<v Speaker 1>old story is a lot that's written is way</v>
<v Speaker 1>older than 5,000 years.</v>

22
00:01:26.991 --> 00:01:27.824
<v Speaker 1>Like we're used to being in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment where there's a million </v>

23
00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:32.330
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.210
<v Speaker 1>because we have books and movies and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these things,</v>

25
00:01:35.211 --> 00:01:36.044
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in slower moving and more archaic </v>

26
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.283
<v Speaker 1>cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially ones that are just just have </v>

27
00:01:40.641 --> 00:01:43.550
<v Speaker 1>an oral tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like there's a million stories.</v>

28
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.760
<v Speaker 1>There's like 20 canonical stories and </v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows how old they are.</v>

29
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.740
<v Speaker 1>There was evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>linguistic evidence.</v>

30
00:01:51.741 --> 00:01:52.574
<v Speaker 1>I just saw a study on this last week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone sent it to me showing that some </v>

31
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:57.763
<v Speaker 1>of the fairytales that the grimm </v>
<v Speaker 1>brothers gathered might be 10,000 years </v>

32
00:02:01.401 --> 00:02:06.401
<v Speaker 1>old and that doesn't surprise me because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of depth that's in a good fairy</v>

33
00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:07.814
<v Speaker 1>tale is so the depth is so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The profundity is so deep that there's </v>

34
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.170
<v Speaker 1>no way that someone could just </v>
<v Speaker 1>contracted up,</v>

35
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 years ago.</v>

36
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.163
<v Speaker 1>Because there's layers and layers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>layers of meaning and they're basically </v>

37
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.760
<v Speaker 1>archetipal and religious in </v>
<v Speaker 1>significance.</v>

38
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.020
<v Speaker 1>And a Hansel and Gretel story is a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>example of that.</v>

39
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sleeping beauty is a good example of</v>

40
00:02:30.501 --> 00:02:32.510
<v Speaker 1>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the canonical fairytales are,</v>

41
00:02:32.511 --> 00:02:33.950
<v Speaker 1>they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very powerful.</v>

42
00:02:33.951 --> 00:02:36.050
<v Speaker 1>They pack a lot of meaning into a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>short</v>

43
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.950
<v Speaker 1>and do a very limited amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

44
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.310
<v Speaker 1>so it was great that this was an arrest </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was only unearthed in the late 18</v>

45
00:02:48.311 --> 00:02:51.550
<v Speaker 1>hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we haven't known about this story for</v>

46
00:02:51.551 --> 00:02:52.660
<v Speaker 1>a long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

47
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.480
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a tremendously exciting discovery</v>

48
00:02:55.481 --> 00:02:57.670
<v Speaker 1>on the part of the people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who dug it up.</v>

49
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.510
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to tell you the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

50
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:05.763
<v Speaker 1>the primary character in the story is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a dragon mother named tire mount </v>

51
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.713
<v Speaker 1>and tire map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could think about or as half the </v>

52
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:19.670
<v Speaker 1>dragon of chaos and half the destructive</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative feminine.</v>

53
00:03:19.671 --> 00:03:20.504
<v Speaker 1>So she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think about her as what sort of </v>

54
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:26.060
<v Speaker 1>on the border between what's a known </v>
<v Speaker 1>known and unknown and unknown.</v>

55
00:03:26.061 --> 00:03:28.840
<v Speaker 1>And she is construed as the mother of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all things.</v>

56
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.440
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mother of all things is like,</v>

57
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 1>what was it revealed when the towers </v>
<v Speaker 1>came down?</v>

58
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.423
<v Speaker 1>Is this tremendously complex background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multilevel system of operations that's </v>

59
00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:49.351
<v Speaker 1>always going on that that identifiable </v>
<v Speaker 1>singular things emerged from now.</v>

60
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.413
<v Speaker 1>The mesopotamians wouldn't have said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because what they said was this </v>

61
00:03:55.031 --> 00:03:55.864
<v Speaker 1>story because that's the form in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>their knowledge it had developed to the </v>

62
00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:00.754
<v Speaker 1>point where they could tell a story </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it instead of maybe acting it out </v>

63
00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:05.410
<v Speaker 1>or dreaming about it in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.740
<v Speaker 1>but they couldn't articulate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can barely articulate it now,</v>

65
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.340
<v Speaker 1>so there's time out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's viewed as the mother of all things</v>

66
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.710
<v Speaker 1>and she has a husband named app suit </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's her concert.</v>

67
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.660
<v Speaker 1>Very little said about absolut in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular story,</v>

68
00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:20.494
<v Speaker 1>and I think the reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I'm not sure if this is that </v>

69
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.600
<v Speaker 1>the Mesopotamian civilization was new </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough as a technological state,</v>

70
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.733
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they made cities as a </v>

71
00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:35.911
<v Speaker 1>technological state that the mint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the myths of humanity hadn't figured out</v>

72
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.500
<v Speaker 1>how to encapsulate the nature of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our technological</v>

73
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.073
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy.</v>

74
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.583
<v Speaker 1>There was a sense that it existed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there wasn't a sense of it as a </v>

75
00:04:48.931 --> 00:04:49.764
<v Speaker 1>carrot differentiated character that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of doing all sorts of different </v>

76
00:04:52.411 --> 00:04:54.870
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that didn't emerge until Egypt,</v>

77
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.870
<v Speaker 1>although I'm not certain of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's how it looks to me.</v>

78
00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.123
<v Speaker 1>So absolute is her husband now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the Mesopotamian started with </v>

79
00:05:03.601 --> 00:05:05.700
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the same way that the people</v>

80
00:05:05.701 --> 00:05:09.690
<v Speaker 1>who wrote genesis started the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They thought that the world was a desk.</v>

81
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.290
<v Speaker 1>You know what the world's like when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>go outside and you stand in a field,</v>

82
00:05:13.291 --> 00:05:14.880
<v Speaker 1>it's a flat field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at the world,</v>

83
00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:15.714
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty obvious what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big disk of earth and then </v>

84
00:05:18.271 --> 00:05:19.104
<v Speaker 1>there's a dome on top of it and in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dome or the Sun and the moon and the </v>

85
00:05:21.781 --> 00:05:23.700
<v Speaker 1>stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might ask,</v>

86
00:05:23.701 --> 00:05:24.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's underneath the earth?</v>

87
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.780
<v Speaker 1>And that the answer for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamians was um,</v>

88
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.230
<v Speaker 1>fresh water first and then sold water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how did you know that?</v>

89
00:05:31.231 --> 00:05:32.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you drilled down,</v>

90
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.213
<v Speaker 1>then the fresh water would come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So obviously it was fresh water down </v>

91
00:05:35.131 --> 00:05:37.020
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you went to the edge of your</v>

92
00:05:37.021 --> 00:05:37.854
<v Speaker 1>territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

93
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the salt water.</v>

94
00:05:39.481 --> 00:05:41.970
<v Speaker 1>So the earth was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.340
<v Speaker 1>let the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth,</v>

96
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.670
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it disk of matter,</v>

97
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.350
<v Speaker 1>resting on a disk of fresh water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resting on a disk of salt,</v>

98
00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:56.351
<v Speaker 1>water and absolute time at were the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fresh and salt water respect.</v>

99
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now the Mesopotamians thought that</v>

100
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.553
<v Speaker 1>the way that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that absolutely time that gave birth to </v>

101
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:09.290
<v Speaker 1>everything was that they joined together</v>
<v Speaker 1>in sexual union.</v>

102
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like the Yin and the Yang and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>very much like that in fact,</v>

103
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.250
<v Speaker 1>and that it was out of their union that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

104
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.443
<v Speaker 1>the elemental God's emerged and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think of the elemental gods as </v>

105
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.970
<v Speaker 1>there are forces of nature and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewed through.</v>

106
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:27.523
<v Speaker 1>They're not personified because to </v>
<v Speaker 1>personify something means that you see </v>

107
00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:35.270
<v Speaker 1>it as an objective phenomena and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>attribute human characteristics to it.</v>

108
00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:36.104
<v Speaker 1>And that isn't how people work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is we perceive human </v>

109
00:06:38.661 --> 00:06:39.494
<v Speaker 1>characteristics and then only with trip </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible effort do we extract out the </v>

110
00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:44.774
<v Speaker 1>objective reality from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we depersonalize things when we </v>

111
00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:49.574
<v Speaker 1>become scientific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we just naturally see them as </v>

112
00:06:51.651 --> 00:06:54.440
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can see this when you read books</v>

113
00:06:54.441 --> 00:06:55.131
<v Speaker 1>to kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:55.964
<v Speaker 1>like everything's a person that train is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person in a car as a person that moon </v>

115
00:07:00.201 --> 00:07:02.870
<v Speaker 1>is a person and the sun is a person and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

116
00:07:02.871 --> 00:07:07.190
<v Speaker 1>you read stories to children that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as a presupposition,</v>

117
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:08.430
<v Speaker 1>doesn't bother you at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

118
00:07:08.431 --> 00:07:09.264
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just fall right into it with no </v>

119
00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:11.140
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

120
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.983
<v Speaker 1>and in the automation is you see the sun</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sky smiling and bouncing along </v>

121
00:07:14.721 --> 00:07:16.280
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't bother you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

122
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.193
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no problem to look at the world </v>

123
00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:19.304
<v Speaker 1>that way and there's some utility in </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the world in that way as as </v>

124
00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:22.724
<v Speaker 1>we'll discover.</v>

125
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:24.793
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think part of the reason that we </v>

126
00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:27.290
<v Speaker 1>view things that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

127
00:07:27.291 --> 00:07:30.620
<v Speaker 1>That was the other thing I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you about our perceptual systems is</v>

128
00:07:30.621 --> 00:07:35.300
<v Speaker 1>that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do have a social cognitive platform,</v>

129
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.140
<v Speaker 1>intellectual platform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that our primary categories,</v>

130
00:07:39.141 --> 00:07:42.080
<v Speaker 1>the primary categories of our mind do </v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to be social.</v>

131
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.860
<v Speaker 1>So you could say that the reason our </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind evolved,</v>

132
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:46.723
<v Speaker 1>or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say that the fundamental </v>

133
00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:53.291
<v Speaker 1>selecting pressures on our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on our mind ensured that the,</v>

134
00:07:55.050 --> 00:08:00.050
<v Speaker 1>the primary substructure of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive ability was modules that could</v>

135
00:08:00.471 --> 00:08:04.490
<v Speaker 1>understand social behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men could understand,</v>

136
00:08:04.491 --> 00:08:06.350
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women could understand men,</v>

137
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.780
<v Speaker 1>men and women could understand children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

138
00:08:08.781 --> 00:08:10.850
<v Speaker 1>men and women could understand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>social world.</v>

139
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

140
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:18.490
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're specialized for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it was only after those systems</v>

141
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:21.350
<v Speaker 1>developed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hyper developed probably under the,</v>

142
00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under the force of sexual selection that</v>

143
00:08:24.411 --> 00:08:25.244
<v Speaker 1>they became able to separate themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>to some degree from that underlying </v>

144
00:08:28.371 --> 00:08:29.204
<v Speaker 1>social cognitive structure and start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see the world in ways that weren't </v>

145
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.073
<v Speaker 1>personified.</v>

146
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:34.573
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what that means is that our natural </v>

147
00:08:36.741 --> 00:08:40.310
<v Speaker 1>categories are still an anthropomorphic </v>
<v Speaker 1>and dramatic,</v>

148
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.010
<v Speaker 1>and it actually turns out that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

149
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:43.363
<v Speaker 1>So absolute timeout nature and culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a perfectly reasonable way of </v>

150
00:08:49.131 --> 00:08:50.420
<v Speaker 1>thinking about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they would say,</v>

151
00:08:50.421 --> 00:08:51.254
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the interplay between nature and </v>

152
00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:57.930
<v Speaker 1>culture that gives rise to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>primordial forces of nature.</v>

153
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.823
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those forces of nature would be to some </v>

154
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:02.880
<v Speaker 1>degree external,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a storm or fire.</v>

155
00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:05.670
<v Speaker 1>But they would be some to some degree </v>
<v Speaker 1>internal to like,</v>

156
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.070
<v Speaker 1>like the fire of passion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

157
00:09:08.071 --> 00:09:13.071
<v Speaker 1>And the and the storm of swirl because </v>
<v Speaker 1>those are natural forces as well.</v>

158
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:14.363
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that the ancients </v>
<v Speaker 1>knew was that man was created to serve </v>

159
00:09:18.481 --> 00:09:19.314
<v Speaker 1>the gods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course modern people think of </v>

160
00:09:21.541 --> 00:09:22.374
<v Speaker 1>that as a superstition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's because they don't really </v>

161
00:09:23.671 --> 00:09:27.000
<v Speaker 1>understand how archaic people thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Archaic people thought.</v>

162
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Like Freud thought it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

163
00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:31.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have an ego fine.</v>

164
00:09:31.831 --> 00:09:32.664
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as long as you're in a box within a </v>

165
00:09:34.051 --> 00:09:36.090
<v Speaker 1>bunch of other blocks is the eagle runs </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

166
00:09:36.091 --> 00:09:39.780
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as we put you somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>where those boxes are gone,</v>

167
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.640
<v Speaker 1>it's the underlying forces of nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>that run you hunger,</v>

168
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:45.990
<v Speaker 1>thirst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

169
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:46.943
<v Speaker 1>aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality and all those things that are </v>

170
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:50.813
<v Speaker 1>impersonal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of course you have them and you </v>

171
00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:53.880
<v Speaker 1>have them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so does everyone else.</v>

172
00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:57.600
<v Speaker 1>So they're impersonal and transcendent </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're also eternal.</v>

173
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.490
<v Speaker 1>And so when the art arcade people said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they usually said this with sorrow,</v>

174
00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:07.320
<v Speaker 1>that man was destined to serve the gods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they meant.</v>

175
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:08.183
<v Speaker 1>They meant that we were the play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things have these unbelievably powerful </v>

176
00:10:12.241 --> 00:10:13.074
<v Speaker 1>primordial forces that manifested </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves within our lives and </v>

177
00:10:16.411 --> 00:10:18.530
<v Speaker 1>determined our destinies and in in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

178
00:10:18.531 --> 00:10:21.900
<v Speaker 1>in fact the Mesopotamian said that </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically about the elder gods.</v>

179
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:22.733
<v Speaker 1>They said they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were part of that which determined </v>

180
00:10:25.651 --> 00:10:26.484
<v Speaker 1>human destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They monitor who will talk about in a </v>

181
00:10:28.611 --> 00:10:32.400
<v Speaker 1>while and was given the tablet of </v>
<v Speaker 1>destinies because when he was,</v>

182
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.590
<v Speaker 1>when he asked to become top God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

183
00:10:34.591 --> 00:10:35.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm going to be taught God,</v>

184
00:10:35.821 --> 00:10:38.040
<v Speaker 1>I get to determine the destinies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

185
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.830
<v Speaker 1>we'll get to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

186
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.570
<v Speaker 1>you kind of got to know what these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what these archaic,</v>

187
00:10:42.571 --> 00:10:45.390
<v Speaker 1>God's work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were personalities.</v>

188
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:46.680
<v Speaker 1>You know when you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

189
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.181
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

190
00:10:48.181 --> 00:10:52.950
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a mistake to attribute the </v>
<v Speaker 1>qualities of personality to a storm.</v>

191
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Although it depends on what you think a </v>
<v Speaker 1>storm is like.</v>

192
00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.393
<v Speaker 1>A modern person would think of a storm </v>
<v Speaker 1>as an objective event that you have </v>

193
00:11:01.921 --> 00:11:02.754
<v Speaker 1>subjective reactions to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our caring person would more likely </v>

194
00:11:05.641 --> 00:11:10.641
<v Speaker 1>think of the storm as the subjective </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of the storm plus the storm</v>

195
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:11.910
<v Speaker 1>all at once.</v>

196
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:12.743
<v Speaker 1>They would make that separation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a lot easier to personify </v>

197
00:11:16.351 --> 00:11:18.980
<v Speaker 1>something under those conditions or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>to personify it,</v>

198
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.823
<v Speaker 1>but to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to stay within the realm of </v>

199
00:11:22.771 --> 00:11:24.780
<v Speaker 1>conceptualization that makes it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>persona.</v>

200
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.673
<v Speaker 1>Find Force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the storm God is something that you </v>

201
00:11:28.701 --> 00:11:30.900
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can instill terror into your heart.</v>

202
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:31.471
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

203
00:11:31.471 --> 00:11:33.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

204
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:35.790
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

205
00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:37.710
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

206
00:11:37.711 --> 00:11:38.544
<v Speaker 1>absolutely time map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They give rise to these primordial gods </v>

207
00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.013
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to think about them as </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces of nature and I think that's a </v>

208
00:11:47.041 --> 00:11:49.950
<v Speaker 1>reasonable representation for a variety </v>
<v Speaker 1>of reasons.</v>

209
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:55.070
<v Speaker 1>They're like the titans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

210
00:11:55.071 --> 00:11:55.904
<v Speaker 1>so the given rise to these gods and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gods are their children and they run </v>

211
00:12:00.771 --> 00:12:01.604
<v Speaker 1>about making all sorts of rack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were making rockets and they're </v>

212
00:12:04.071 --> 00:12:06.680
<v Speaker 1>doing this and they're doing that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're building things in there messing</v>

213
00:12:06.681 --> 00:12:07.514
<v Speaker 1>about with things in their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their noisily engaged in their </v>

214
00:12:10.191 --> 00:12:11.024
<v Speaker 1>interactions with one another and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're having children and they're </v>

215
00:12:12.681 --> 00:12:16.550
<v Speaker 1>fighting about sex and they're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>making racket like Matt and then they do</v>

216
00:12:16.551 --> 00:12:20.810
<v Speaker 1>something stupid and so they're annoying</v>
<v Speaker 1>time as they make all this rocket.</v>

217
00:12:20.811 --> 00:12:23.510
<v Speaker 1>She's sorta slumbering down there in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>depths,</v>

218
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.863
<v Speaker 1>leaving them be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they make all this racket that may </v>

219
00:12:27.521 --> 00:12:30.580
<v Speaker 1>annoy her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's the environmentalist myth</v>

220
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.530
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the same idea.</v>

221
00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.180
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>

222
00:12:34.181 --> 00:12:35.014
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of dopey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're running around gratifying our </v>

223
00:12:36.971 --> 00:12:37.804
<v Speaker 1>fundamental needs and making racket and </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroying things and if we're not </v>

224
00:12:41.441 --> 00:12:42.274
<v Speaker 1>careful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother nature will come flooding back </v>

225
00:12:43.241 --> 00:12:45.100
<v Speaker 1>and like wipe us out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

226
00:12:45.101 --> 00:12:45.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

227
00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.350
<v Speaker 1>that's happened in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could happen,</v>

228
00:12:47.351 --> 00:12:49.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's an archetypal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an archetypal idea.</v>

229
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:50.803
<v Speaker 1>It's a mythological idea so far and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're making racket and time that's </v>

230
00:12:54.191 --> 00:12:57.190
<v Speaker 1>leaving them be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they get arrogant,</v>

231
00:12:57.191 --> 00:12:58.024
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or careless and they kill app suit and </v>

232
00:13:00.671 --> 00:13:03.190
<v Speaker 1>they make their dwelling place on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>corpse.</v>

233
00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a brilliant,</v>

234
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:08.470
<v Speaker 1>brilliant symbolic idea because what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>means,</v>

235
00:13:08.471 --> 00:13:10.990
<v Speaker 1>it means a bunch of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that means is that</v>

236
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:15.160
<v Speaker 1>in so far as the gods are because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're masculine,</v>

237
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.313
<v Speaker 1>they're part of the representation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dominance hierarchy and the human </v>

238
00:13:18.551 --> 00:13:22.000
<v Speaker 1>interactions within it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That the idea that that,</v>

239
00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:23.463
<v Speaker 1>that that's all existing on the corpus </v>
<v Speaker 1>of apps is something like the idea that </v>

240
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:33.490
<v Speaker 1>all of the natural forces that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>embodied within human beings and driving</v>

241
00:13:33.491 --> 00:13:34.324
<v Speaker 1>them are resting on a substructure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dead culture and everyone knows that </v>

242
00:13:41.261 --> 00:13:43.240
<v Speaker 1>because everyone says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially modern people,</v>

243
00:13:43.241 --> 00:13:44.560
<v Speaker 1>they look back at their culture and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

244
00:13:44.561 --> 00:13:45.550
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing's dead.</v>

245
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:46.943
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we can rest comfortably on its </v>

246
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:49.541
<v Speaker 1>surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

247
00:13:49.541 --> 00:13:51.310
<v Speaker 1>that's not right because if it's dead,</v>

248
00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:53.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's dead,</v>

249
00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.960
<v Speaker 1>logically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not alive.</v>

250
00:13:55.961 --> 00:13:56.794
<v Speaker 1>Then if it's not alive at can't adapt </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if it doesn't adapt and it falls </v>

251
00:13:59.101 --> 00:14:03.390
<v Speaker 1>behind and gets full of errors and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets corrupt and starts to fall apart,</v>

252
00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:04.373
<v Speaker 1>and if it gets corrupted full of errors </v>
<v Speaker 1>and falls apart enough than chaos comes </v>

253
00:14:07.711 --> 00:14:08.544
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what happens in the </v>

254
00:14:09.451 --> 00:14:10.284
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamian myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they kill app soon and they keep </v>

255
00:14:12.421 --> 00:14:15.660
<v Speaker 1>making racket and tie him at wakes up </v>
<v Speaker 1>one day and she thinks,</v>

256
00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.790
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're noisy.</v>

257
00:14:17.791 --> 00:14:21.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't like them that much and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've gone and done in my husband,</v>

258
00:14:21.181 --> 00:14:24.570
<v Speaker 1>which is order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to wait them out.</v>

259
00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:28.950
<v Speaker 1>So the gods get wind of this and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not very happy about it,</v>

260
00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:30.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because after all they're gone.</v>

261
00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:31.523
<v Speaker 1>But she is the god goddess slash drag </v>
<v Speaker 1>that gave them all life and the </v>

262
00:14:37.981 --> 00:14:42.390
<v Speaker 1>probability that they'll prevail in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle against that which gave them form</v>

263
00:14:42.391 --> 00:14:43.440
<v Speaker 1>is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very low.</v>

264
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:48.500
<v Speaker 1>So they're pretty damn terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So meanwhile time Matt is generating her</v>

265
00:14:48.991 --> 00:14:52.850
<v Speaker 1>army and she generates quite an army and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamians list out what she does.</v>

266
00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:55.670
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she first of all picks for her concert,</v>

267
00:14:55.671 --> 00:15:00.671
<v Speaker 1>a new character named king and king who </v>
<v Speaker 1>is like the king of the demons monsters.</v>

268
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:07.910
<v Speaker 1>So her old husband was absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe he was ordered and her new husband</v>

269
00:15:07.911 --> 00:15:08.744
<v Speaker 1>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not someone that you want to have </v>

270
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:13.880
<v Speaker 1>around at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he's basically put at the hand of</v>

271
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:15.223
<v Speaker 1>this flanks of terrible monsters and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>generates like Scorpion monsters and </v>

272
00:15:18.621 --> 00:15:19.454
<v Speaker 1>crocodile monsters and all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things in her army so that she can go </v>

273
00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:23.540
<v Speaker 1>wipe out these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these gods.</v>

274
00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:24.853
<v Speaker 1>And so while this is happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gods gathered themselves together </v>

275
00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:29.023
<v Speaker 1>and they decided that they'll elect a </v>
<v Speaker 1>champion from within their ranks to go </v>

276
00:15:31.731 --> 00:15:33.110
<v Speaker 1>out and fight with tire map.</v>

277
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.333
<v Speaker 1>And so they do that and they said one </v>
<v Speaker 1>God out and he comes back with his tail </v>

278
00:15:36.771 --> 00:15:38.210
<v Speaker 1>between his legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

279
00:15:38.211 --> 00:15:39.050
<v Speaker 1>all white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't lie,</v>

280
00:15:39.051 --> 00:15:42.110
<v Speaker 1>his encounter with chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they send another God out.</v>

281
00:15:42.111 --> 00:15:44.120
<v Speaker 1>The same thing happens and they send </v>
<v Speaker 1>another God out.</v>

282
00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:45.003
<v Speaker 1>The same thing happens and it's getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty damn hopeless because they're </v>

283
00:15:47.391 --> 00:15:50.690
<v Speaker 1>sending out their best men against chaos</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

284
00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:51.763
<v Speaker 1>and the mother of all things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're getting struggled all the </v>

285
00:15:55.041 --> 00:15:57.860
<v Speaker 1>time</v>
<v Speaker 1>while this was happening.</v>

286
00:15:57.861 --> 00:16:00.440
<v Speaker 1>They continue to produce new generations</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Gods.</v>

287
00:16:00.441 --> 00:16:02.600
<v Speaker 1>And at one point this new God emerges </v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

288
00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.670
<v Speaker 1>as a young person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I presume.</v>

289
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>

290
00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.093
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some things that are different </v>

291
00:16:07.811 --> 00:16:10.880
<v Speaker 1>than about him than any other thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's being produced so far.</v>

292
00:16:10.881 --> 00:16:12.520
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's different </v>
<v Speaker 1>is he's,</v>

293
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:14.870
<v Speaker 1>he's quite tall and powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

294
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:17.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not necessarily so radical,</v>

295
00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.220
<v Speaker 1>but he has eyes all the way around his </v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

296
00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:23.390
<v Speaker 1>And when he speaks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can speak darkness into being,</v>

297
00:16:23.391 --> 00:16:24.224
<v Speaker 1>any can speak light into being so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so things obey the commands of his </v>

298
00:16:27.621 --> 00:16:30.110
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He's a master of language.</v>

299
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.420
<v Speaker 1>He can see everywhere and he's a master </v>
<v Speaker 1>of language.</v>

300
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:33.883
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the Guardian to checking him out </v>

301
00:16:34.641 --> 00:16:35.181
<v Speaker 1>and they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

302
00:16:35.181 --> 00:16:35.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

303
00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:36.573
<v Speaker 1>he's quite something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we can get him to go after time </v>

304
00:16:38.871 --> 00:16:41.420
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they all go to him in this,</v>

305
00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:43.010
<v Speaker 1>in this little group and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

306
00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:44.660
<v Speaker 1>Marduk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's his name.</v>

307
00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

308
00:16:46.191 --> 00:16:49.700
<v Speaker 1>we've been checking you out and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking pretty impressive.</v>

309
00:16:49.701 --> 00:16:51.370
<v Speaker 1>And so we've got a proposition for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

310
00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:54.770
<v Speaker 1>how about if you go fight time map and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marta,</v>

311
00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:59.800
<v Speaker 1>who's not only all seeing and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and very capable with languages,</v>

312
00:16:59.931 --> 00:17:00.950
<v Speaker 1>no fool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>

313
00:17:00.951 --> 00:17:01.521
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

314
00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:02.900
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get what you want,</v>

315
00:17:02.901 --> 00:17:03.734
<v Speaker 1>but here's the deal.</v>

316
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:09.010
<v Speaker 1>You get everybody together first and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>go fight your monster,</v>

317
00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:13.100
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to have a congress and </v>
<v Speaker 1>add that Congress.</v>

318
00:17:13.101 --> 00:17:18.080
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be king of the gods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll go fight time map.</v>

319
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:21.080
<v Speaker 1>And so of course the other gods aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>very happy about this,</v>

320
00:17:21.081 --> 00:17:24.680
<v Speaker 1>but they go off and they have a congress</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they invite mark to it and they talk</v>

321
00:17:24.681 --> 00:17:26.930
<v Speaker 1>about it and they realize they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really have any other choice.</v>

322
00:17:26.931 --> 00:17:30.710
<v Speaker 1>So they decided that they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>elect Marduk to the top of the hierarchy</v>

323
00:17:30.711 --> 00:17:34.220
<v Speaker 1>of gods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's such a smart idea.</v>

324
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.520
<v Speaker 1>So if you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

325
00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.340
<v Speaker 1>you can think of a hero and then you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>take,</v>

326
00:17:40.341 --> 00:17:43.520
<v Speaker 1>if you took 10 heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an average them out of that,</v>

327
00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:45.380
<v Speaker 1>you get a a God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

328
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.470
<v Speaker 1>So it'd be 10 heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get Annetta here out of that,</v>

329
00:17:48.471 --> 00:17:49.470
<v Speaker 1>and that would be a god.</v>

330
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:54.770
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you do that to 10 sets of</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 heroes and you get 10 mega heroes and</v>

331
00:17:55.141 --> 00:17:57.930
<v Speaker 1>then you take all those medical heroes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you figure out what's the same about</v>

332
00:17:57.931 --> 00:18:02.400
<v Speaker 1>them and you abstract that out and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the hero of heroes of heroes.</v>

333
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.980
<v Speaker 1>And that's the archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the archetype.</v>

334
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:06.203
<v Speaker 1>It's a process of distillation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like who is the most interesting </v>

335
00:18:09.391 --> 00:18:13.470
<v Speaker 1>possible at the most interesting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable possible person?</v>

336
00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be this person.</v>

337
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:18.210
<v Speaker 1>This is the most memorable possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

338
00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:19.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know who that is,</v>

339
00:18:19.921 --> 00:18:21.660
<v Speaker 1>but this is how we figured out how I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could say,</v>

340
00:18:21.661 --> 00:18:22.494
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I admire something about you and I </v>

341
00:18:23.161 --> 00:18:23.994
<v Speaker 1>admire something about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can notice that as a phenomenal </v>

342
00:18:26.061 --> 00:18:26.894
<v Speaker 1>logical fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You seem very capable in a certain way </v>

343
00:18:29.221 --> 00:18:31.560
<v Speaker 1>and you know you have this attribute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I might say,</v>

344
00:18:31.561 --> 00:18:33.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was gonna,</v>

345
00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:38.850
<v Speaker 1>sort out an ideal for myself to follow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I take the good parts of all of you</v>

346
00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.900
<v Speaker 1>and I put that into one thing and then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would make that my ideal.</v>

347
00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:44.123
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the origin of the idea of the </v>

348
00:18:45.001 --> 00:18:45.834
<v Speaker 1>savior of the Messiah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it's an emergent idea emerges </v>

349
00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:51.413
<v Speaker 1>when people notice that the hero is the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hero is part of the forest that </v>

350
00:18:55.441 --> 00:18:58.020
<v Speaker 1>makes order out of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or sometimes the reverse.</v>

351
00:18:58.021 --> 00:18:58.854
<v Speaker 1>When when order has become too rigid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can also decompose order bringing a </v>

352
00:19:03.121 --> 00:19:06.000
<v Speaker 1>little necessary chaos into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rejuvenate the whole structure.</v>

353
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:08.820
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Marta,</v>

354
00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:12.570
<v Speaker 1>he gets elected king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might think about how would this</v>

355
00:19:12.571 --> 00:19:15.270
<v Speaker 1>happen historically speaking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

356
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:17.130
<v Speaker 1>here's an interesting way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

357
00:19:17.131 --> 00:19:20.580
<v Speaker 1>so imagine a landscape that consists of </v>
<v Speaker 1>tribes,</v>

358
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.670
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then on top of them,</v>

359
00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.120
<v Speaker 1>imagine a landscape of the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

360
00:19:27.121 --> 00:19:27.954
<v Speaker 1>so each member of each tribal group </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives in their imagined world and that </v>

361
00:19:33.691 --> 00:19:34.524
<v Speaker 1>imagined world is full of Dante's and </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural forces of various kinds that </v>

362
00:19:37.711 --> 00:19:38.544
<v Speaker 1>they're following,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you can imagine that as the </v>

363
00:19:40.501 --> 00:19:43.350
<v Speaker 1>tribes battle it out and organize </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

364
00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:46.590
<v Speaker 1>the figures of the imagination do </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same thing.</v>

365
00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:50.520
<v Speaker 1>So as the people are battling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Gods in heaven are battling,</v>

366
00:19:50.521 --> 00:19:51.354
<v Speaker 1>which is also a very common mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as the human beings on a beat </v>

367
00:19:57.391 --> 00:19:58.224
<v Speaker 1>themselves into a functional group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their world conceptions do the same </v>

368
00:20:01.801 --> 00:20:02.634
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so over time you move from </v>

369
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:08.650
<v Speaker 1>polytheism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking to monotheism as the,</v>

370
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.610
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as all these tribes communicate with one</v>

371
00:20:11.611 --> 00:20:13.830
<v Speaker 1>another in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in language,</v>

372
00:20:13.831 --> 00:20:18.600
<v Speaker 1>and in and in combat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sort out just exactly what should be</v>

373
00:20:18.601 --> 00:20:19.710
<v Speaker 1>sovereign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should it be?</v>

374
00:20:19.711 --> 00:20:21.240
<v Speaker 1>Powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should be dominant,</v>

375
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a major,</v>

376
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:24.510
<v Speaker 1>it's a major issue and it's partly </v>
<v Speaker 1>practical.</v>

377
00:20:24.511 --> 00:20:29.040
<v Speaker 1>It's partly conceptual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is reflected in the Mesopotamian</v>

378
00:20:29.041 --> 00:20:29.874
<v Speaker 1>creation myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gods assemble themselves and they </v>

379
00:20:32.971 --> 00:20:34.530
<v Speaker 1>look among them and they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

380
00:20:34.531 --> 00:20:35.364
<v Speaker 1>well some one here is has the </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristics that should should be </v>

381
00:20:41.101 --> 00:20:45.690
<v Speaker 1>the central element of the top dating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like the ultimate value.</v>

382
00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.273
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the Mesopotamians chose wisely </v>

383
00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:53.830
<v Speaker 1>vision and language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are your most,</v>

384
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:59.190
<v Speaker 1>the most potent weapons you have against</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos because you,</v>

385
00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:00.463
<v Speaker 1>if you pay attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see chaos when it first emerges </v>

386
00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.440
<v Speaker 1>and then if you are a master of </v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

387
00:21:05.441 --> 00:21:06.274
<v Speaker 1>you can encapsulate it then articulated </v>
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly and you can communicate </v>

388
00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:11.410
<v Speaker 1>that to other people's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like now this it.</v>

389
00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:15.190
<v Speaker 1>You just cannot overestimate how radical</v>
<v Speaker 1>an idea that is.</v>

390
00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:19.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a staggeringly radical idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the set of attributes that should</v>

391
00:21:19.541 --> 00:21:20.374
<v Speaker 1>be at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mesopotamians were trying to figure </v>

392
00:21:21.911 --> 00:21:26.440
<v Speaker 1>out what should be sovereign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should be above everything else.</v>

393
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say a person.</v>

394
00:21:28.361 --> 00:21:28.931
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

395
00:21:28.931 --> 00:21:29.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

396
00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:34.540
<v Speaker 1>the person embodies sovereignty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sovereignty itself as something else.</v>

397
00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:35.733
<v Speaker 1>So when Frans de Waal for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was watching chimpanzees hash it out </v>

398
00:21:39.191 --> 00:21:40.750
<v Speaker 1>for dominance in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

399
00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:44.030
<v Speaker 1>in the zoo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's in the hall and our.</v>

400
00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:47.020
<v Speaker 1>I think anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a zoo that has a lot of chimpanzees</v>

401
00:21:47.021 --> 00:21:50.650
<v Speaker 1>in and he spent a lot of time watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and you know,</v>

402
00:21:50.651 --> 00:21:54.790
<v Speaker 1>one idea about the dominant chimp is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's just the biggest,</v>

403
00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:58.420
<v Speaker 1>meanest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most tyrannical chimp.</v>

404
00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:01.540
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of the strong man theory of </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimp leadership,</v>

405
00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:03.910
<v Speaker 1>but what do all observed was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

406
00:22:03.911 --> 00:22:06.340
<v Speaker 1>that was sort of true in that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>strongest,</v>

407
00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.880
<v Speaker 1>meanest chimpanzee could obtain </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance.</v>

408
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:14.230
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with him is if he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>really like selfish and cruel,</v>

409
00:22:14.231 --> 00:22:17.710
<v Speaker 1>was that he didn't have any friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now chimps have friends and they spend a</v>

410
00:22:17.711 --> 00:22:18.544
<v Speaker 1>lot of time with them and they groom </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other and they protect each other </v>

411
00:22:20.501 --> 00:22:22.840
<v Speaker 1>and fights and like you can be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ugliest,</v>

412
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.630
<v Speaker 1>meanest chimp around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if there's two chimps that are three</v>

413
00:22:25.631 --> 00:22:28.250
<v Speaker 1>quarters of your strength coming at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you.</v>

414
00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.310
<v Speaker 1>You lose now.</v>

415
00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:31.203
<v Speaker 1>So that means two chimps that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of enough civilization to bind </v>

416
00:22:34.031 --> 00:22:34.864
<v Speaker 1>themselves in to a dyad that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has mutual obligations across time </v>

417
00:22:40.601 --> 00:22:43.200
<v Speaker 1>is way stronger than one ship who </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't.</v>

418
00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:46.990
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that strength </v>
<v Speaker 1>and viciousness,</v>

419
00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:48.503
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be times when that can emerge </v>

420
00:22:49.661 --> 00:22:51.280
<v Speaker 1>as the dominant power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very,</v>

421
00:22:51.281 --> 00:22:55.480
<v Speaker 1>very unstable and everyone's motivated </v>
<v Speaker 1>to bring it down as fast as possible.</v>

422
00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:57.820
<v Speaker 1>And the best way to bring it down is </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a coalition.</v>

423
00:22:58.030 --> 00:22:58.863
<v Speaker 1>And so partly what that indicates is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's actually the chimp who's the </v>

424
00:23:01.511 --> 00:23:04.810
<v Speaker 1>best at making coalitions that's most </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to become sovereign.</v>

425
00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:06.063
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's actually what happens with </v>

426
00:23:06.731 --> 00:23:07.564
<v Speaker 1>the chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the dictator chimp is very </v>

427
00:23:10.211 --> 00:23:12.950
<v Speaker 1>unstable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the one story I read it of Arnhem</v>

428
00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.940
<v Speaker 1>at the Arnhem Zoo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he rose to the top,</v>

429
00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:16.810
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

430
00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:17.643
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

431
00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:18.760
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad guy,</v>

432
00:23:18.761 --> 00:23:19.780
<v Speaker 1>that gangster guy.</v>

433
00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:23.470
<v Speaker 1>And a two chimps went after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>been torn to pieces.</v>

434
00:23:23.471 --> 00:23:26.860
<v Speaker 1>They tore off his testicles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

435
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:28.023
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it agitated the hell out of the rest of </v>

436
00:23:29.201 --> 00:23:31.600
<v Speaker 1>the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was like a bloody revolution.</v>

437
00:23:31.601 --> 00:23:32.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really,</v>

438
00:23:32.531 --> 00:23:34.630
<v Speaker 1>really stressful for the troop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

439
00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:38.080
<v Speaker 1>but what it indicates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's so interesting,</v>

440
00:23:38.081 --> 00:23:42.160
<v Speaker 1>is that the idea that in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a dominance hierarchy,</v>

441
00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:47.370
<v Speaker 1>what's most dominant is power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That there's no evidence whatsoever that</v>

442
00:23:48.141 --> 00:23:51.590
<v Speaker 1>that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in fact I was talking to when I have</v>

443
00:23:51.591 --> 00:23:55.700
<v Speaker 1>a partner in a business that I have who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a student of mine at Harvard,</v>

444
00:23:55.701 --> 00:23:56.534
<v Speaker 1>he's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart person and I was talking to </v>

445
00:23:58.491 --> 00:23:59.324
<v Speaker 1>him about dominance hierarchies and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>said something very that I found very </v>

446
00:24:02.961 --> 00:24:03.794
<v Speaker 1>upsetting on a variety of levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said it's not a dominance hierarchy </v>

447
00:24:06.501 --> 00:24:09.650
<v Speaker 1>if you can't put a dog collar on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person one level below you,</v>

448
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:13.010
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty bloody blunt statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when he's he,</v>

449
00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:13.933
<v Speaker 1>he's prone to that sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what he meant is that it's possible </v>

450
00:24:17.001 --> 00:24:17.834
<v Speaker 1>that the idea that the term dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy is not the right term to be </v>

451
00:24:21.261 --> 00:24:22.094
<v Speaker 1>applying to these sorts of social </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures because what it implies is </v>

452
00:24:25.011 --> 00:24:28.310
<v Speaker 1>that what keeps the structure in place </v>
<v Speaker 1>is power.</v>

453
00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:30.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the sort of claim that people</v>

454
00:24:30.381 --> 00:24:32.600
<v Speaker 1>like food make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all about power.</v>

455
00:24:32.601 --> 00:24:35.090
<v Speaker 1>It's like the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not all about power.</v>

456
00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:39.230
<v Speaker 1>It's not all about power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not all about power among animals.</v>

457
00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:42.050
<v Speaker 1>So with power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with chimps,</v>

458
00:24:42.051 --> 00:24:44.570
<v Speaker 1>if that's all you've got is power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get wiped out.</v>

459
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:45.463
<v Speaker 1>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what the wall found was that the </v>

460
00:24:47.301 --> 00:24:48.134
<v Speaker 1>chimps who were able to establish stable</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns of leadership were quite </v>

461
00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.240
<v Speaker 1>congenial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a lot of allies,</v>

462
00:24:54.241 --> 00:24:55.074
<v Speaker 1>so they engaged in mutual grooming and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of social interaction and they were </v>

463
00:24:58.011 --> 00:25:01.550
<v Speaker 1>very positively predisposed to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>females in the truth.</v>

464
00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:03.780
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

465
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:07.850
<v Speaker 1>because we don't know what constitutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>valid sovereignty,</v>

466
00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:11.360
<v Speaker 1>but even in animals it doesn't seem to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be power.</v>

467
00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:13.670
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

468
00:25:13.671 --> 00:25:14.504
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at wolf packs and that sort of </v>

469
00:25:15.401 --> 00:25:17.770
<v Speaker 1>thing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if two wolves go at it for,</v>

470
00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:21.770
<v Speaker 1>for dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one wolf will back off and roll over and</v>

471
00:25:21.771 --> 00:25:24.950
<v Speaker 1>show his throat and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Stalin,</v>

472
00:25:24.951 --> 00:25:26.870
<v Speaker 1>Wolf would just tear out his throat.</v>

473
00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:32.240
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Churchill Wolf,</v>

474
00:25:32.241 --> 00:25:33.140
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would say,</v>

475
00:25:33.141 --> 00:25:34.370
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of useless,</v>

476
00:25:34.371 --> 00:25:37.000
<v Speaker 1>but we might need to be around later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why don't you get up and you know,</v>

477
00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:39.680
<v Speaker 1>we'll let bygones be bygones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what wolves do,</v>

478
00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and unsurprisingly,</v>

479
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:44.210
<v Speaker 1>because what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kill everyone in your troop?</v>

480
00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:45.793
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it doesn't seem like a very </v>

481
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:49.070
<v Speaker 1>effective strategy either for meeting or</v>
<v Speaker 1>for survival.</v>

482
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.353
<v Speaker 1>So the Mesopotamians were trying to work</v>
<v Speaker 1>out practically who's going to be </v>

483
00:25:53.241 --> 00:25:54.074
<v Speaker 1>sovereign and at the same time </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptually what is the proper basis </v>

484
00:25:57.831 --> 00:25:58.940
<v Speaker 1>for sovereignty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

485
00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:01.580
<v Speaker 1>it's really the ultimate question in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense.</v>

486
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:03.223
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they elect Marduk and the Martex go </v>

487
00:26:05.091 --> 00:26:07.850
<v Speaker 1>to all these eyes and he can speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he thinks,</v>

488
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:10.610
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

489
00:26:10.611 --> 00:26:12.170
<v Speaker 1>if I win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get the tablet,</v>

490
00:26:12.171 --> 00:26:14.630
<v Speaker 1>have destinies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm taught God.</v>

491
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:15.231
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

492
00:26:15.231 --> 00:26:16.160
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

493
00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:17.810
<v Speaker 1>If you win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>

494
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:18.703
<v Speaker 1>So he goes out to fight timeout and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes a sword and he and he takes a net </v>

495
00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:28.610
<v Speaker 1>and they meet on the battlefield and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>encapsulates timeout in a net,</v>

496
00:26:28.611 --> 00:26:31.280
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant metaphor again,</v>

497
00:26:31.281 --> 00:26:35.660
<v Speaker 1>because chaos is a morphis and unformed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

498
00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.590
<v Speaker 1>And if you want to conquer it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to encapsulate it within a net,</v>

499
00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.090
<v Speaker 1>a net.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>

500
00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 1>you have to make it into something </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than amorphous,</v>

501
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:44.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when.</v>

502
00:26:44.731 --> 00:26:48.990
<v Speaker 1>So look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a client comes to me and they say,</v>

503
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been having these terrible symptoms</v>

504
00:26:51.031 --> 00:26:52.980
<v Speaker 1>on my heart races and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I my,</v>

505
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:53.933
<v Speaker 1>my breath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't catch my breath and I think I'm </v>

506
00:26:55.201 --> 00:26:56.034
<v Speaker 1>going to die and I think maybe I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a heart attack and I'm always at </v>

507
00:26:59.401 --> 00:27:01.770
<v Speaker 1>the hospital and they tell me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing wrong with me,</v>

508
00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:03.120
<v Speaker 1>but I have like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

509
00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:06.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid all the time and I'm starting</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to go out and I say,</v>

510
00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:08.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have agoraphobic.</v>

511
00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.153
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

512
00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:11.973
<v Speaker 1>lots of people have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not the only person like that in </v>

513
00:27:14.771 --> 00:27:15.760
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

514
00:27:15.761 --> 00:27:16.594
<v Speaker 1>it has a name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know what to do about it and there's </v>

515
00:27:19.151 --> 00:27:19.984
<v Speaker 1>a treatment course and they'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is that the </v>

516
00:27:24.761 --> 00:27:25.594
<v Speaker 1>unknown unknown has just been turned </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a known unknown and that's a </v>

517
00:27:28.301 --> 00:27:33.301
<v Speaker 1>massive improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the person who conceptualizes the</v>

518
00:27:33.431 --> 00:27:36.670
<v Speaker 1>anomalous situations fastest is in fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>the leader.</v>

519
00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:39.910
<v Speaker 1>That's the definition of leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we don't know what's going on.</v>

520
00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:42.310
<v Speaker 1>This is what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>

521
00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.470
<v Speaker 1>and when you say this is what's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

522
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:49.390
<v Speaker 1>you also simultaneously say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a million other things that could</v>

523
00:27:49.391 --> 00:27:50.224
<v Speaker 1>have been going on that aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a process of radical </v>

524
00:27:53.471 --> 00:27:56.630
<v Speaker 1>simplification and it lowers the stress </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels immediately anyway,</v>

525
00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:57.473
<v Speaker 1>so time that goes in or articles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets her in a nap and then he splits </v>

526
00:28:01.341 --> 00:28:02.174
<v Speaker 1>in half and he makes heaven out of one </v>
<v Speaker 1>half and the earth out of the other for </v>

527
00:28:04.441 --> 00:28:06.450
<v Speaker 1>the human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

528
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.870
<v Speaker 1>and he goes back to any defeats can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the monsters.</v>

529
00:28:11.871 --> 00:28:12.704
<v Speaker 1>And then he goes back to tell the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>gods and they're pretty happy about </v>

530
00:28:14.361 --> 00:28:16.640
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Keanu had the tablet of destinies.</v>

531
00:28:16.641 --> 00:28:19.400
<v Speaker 1>But Martin took that from him and now he</v>
<v Speaker 1>has it.</v>

532
00:28:19.401 --> 00:28:20.234
<v Speaker 1>So he gets to determine destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he makes human beings out of king </v>

533
00:28:23.211 --> 00:28:24.044
<v Speaker 1>whose blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite an interesting little </v>

534
00:28:26.211 --> 00:28:29.390
<v Speaker 1>twist to the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he makes them to serve the gods.</v>

535
00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:31.850
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's that.</v>

536
00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:32.743
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

537
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:36.930
<v Speaker 1>so the idea is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hero who can see and can communicate</v>

538
00:28:36.931 --> 00:28:40.260
<v Speaker 1>is also the hero who separates out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of existed.</v>

539
00:28:40.261 --> 00:28:41.094
<v Speaker 1>So that it becomes a habitable place and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that humans should serve that serve </v>

540
00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Margo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

541
00:28:46.471 --> 00:28:50.970
<v Speaker 1>you have to serve something well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to serve a natural force of</v>

542
00:28:50.971 --> 00:28:52.450
<v Speaker 1>some sort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you can be all anger.</v>

543
00:28:52.451 --> 00:28:54.330
<v Speaker 1>You can be all last week and we all </v>
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>

544
00:28:54.331 --> 00:28:55.164
<v Speaker 1>We can be all hunger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or are you going to represent some </v>

545
00:28:57.541 --> 00:28:59.340
<v Speaker 1>integrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

546
00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:01.560
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some balanced and integrated</v>

547
00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:07.260
<v Speaker 1>emergent property of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also socially constructed,</v>

548
00:29:07.261 --> 00:29:08.094
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you're a balance of natural </v>

549
00:29:09.491 --> 00:29:10.324
<v Speaker 1>forces and you're a civilized person and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's some sort of essence and that's </v>

550
00:29:13.931 --> 00:29:15.520
<v Speaker 1>what you're going to strive for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

551
00:29:15.521 --> 00:29:17.860
<v Speaker 1>that's Marta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're supposed to be a good Marta.</v>

552
00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:18.753
<v Speaker 1>Now Martin is immortal now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only person who was identified with </v>

553
00:29:21.581 --> 00:29:23.950
<v Speaker 1>Martech in the Mesopotamian realm was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the emperor.</v>

554
00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Now they lived in a walled city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what the emperor,</v>

555
00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:29.013
<v Speaker 1>the reason the emperor was sovereign was</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was supposed to be the </v>

556
00:29:31.001 --> 00:29:31.834
<v Speaker 1>embodiment of Marico and earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which meant that his job was to </v>

557
00:29:34.181 --> 00:29:35.014
<v Speaker 1>transforms chaos into order whenever </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos threatened he was supposed to </v>

558
00:29:38.261 --> 00:29:43.261
<v Speaker 1>transform it back into order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is what Mesopotamians did at the</v>

559
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.130
<v Speaker 1>New Year's celebration when the year is </v>
<v Speaker 1>rejuvenated,</v>

560
00:29:45.131 --> 00:29:46.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The old year dies,</v>

561
00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:48.280
<v Speaker 1>of course we know that because we still </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>

562
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:50.020
<v Speaker 1>and the new year is this new baby.</v>

563
00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:50.853
<v Speaker 1>It's a time of new beginnings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Mesopotamians would take the </v>

564
00:29:53.351 --> 00:29:54.184
<v Speaker 1>emperor out of the city and they'd strip</v>
<v Speaker 1>him of all his emperor close and then </v>

565
00:29:58.331 --> 00:29:59.164
<v Speaker 1>they'd make them recite all the ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>during the last year that he'd been a </v>

566
00:30:02.921 --> 00:30:05.140
<v Speaker 1>bad Marduk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he hadn't kept.</v>

567
00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.513
<v Speaker 1>He hadn't been encountering chaos </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly and hadn't been keeping order </v>

568
00:30:08.981 --> 00:30:12.820
<v Speaker 1>property,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and confess all of his inadequacies.</v>

569
00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Then the priest would come with a glove </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

570
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:17.703
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a ritual punishment and then they </v>

571
00:30:21.101 --> 00:30:21.934
<v Speaker 1>take all the statues out of the old gods</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the city and then they read </v>

572
00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:30.070
<v Speaker 1>represent the battle between Martech and</v>
<v Speaker 1>tire mount.</v>

573
00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:31.383
<v Speaker 1>And then the emperor was Marta and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>would win and then he would have sex </v>

574
00:30:35.861 --> 00:30:39.260
<v Speaker 1>with a ritual prostitute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which was that.</v>

575
00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:41.440
<v Speaker 1>This is a much tougher concept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

576
00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:42.383
<v Speaker 1>It's a way of symbolizing the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>if the creative force encounters the </v>

577
00:30:46.691 --> 00:30:47.524
<v Speaker 1>positive element of the feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the prince and sleeping </v>

578
00:30:50.231 --> 00:30:51.064
<v Speaker 1>beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting sleeping beauty from the grasp </v>

579
00:30:52.721 --> 00:30:54.610
<v Speaker 1>of the evil queen who turns into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dragon.</v>

580
00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:56.020
<v Speaker 1>It's exact because it's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

581
00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:58.030
<v Speaker 1>You've seen that and you'd understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

582
00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:58.960
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sleeping.</v>

583
00:30:58.961 --> 00:31:01.540
<v Speaker 1>Beauty's all in the tower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's covered by a.</v>

584
00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:04.990
<v Speaker 1>she's hemmed in by a huge fields of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thorns.</v>

585
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:07.870
<v Speaker 1>The Evil Queen is trying to stop the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prince from getting to her.</v>

586
00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:10.780
<v Speaker 1>She turns into a dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which makes absolutely no sense,</v>

587
00:31:10.781 --> 00:31:11.614
<v Speaker 1>but everyone follows it and then he has </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fight his way through that to get to </v>

588
00:31:14.201 --> 00:31:15.370
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the main.</v>

589
00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:16.383
<v Speaker 1>It's the same idea in a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>context and then order productive order </v>

590
00:31:20.621 --> 00:31:23.470
<v Speaker 1>being reestablished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody goes back into the kingdom and</v>

591
00:31:23.471 --> 00:31:24.304
<v Speaker 1>it's renewed for the next year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the idea behind Mesopotamian </v>

592
00:31:27.101 --> 00:31:30.790
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty and it's bloody brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's an abs.</v>

593
00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:31.430
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

594
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:32.980
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the beginnings of,</v>

595
00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:34.480
<v Speaker 1>of law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some sense.</v>

596
00:31:34.481 --> 00:31:36.760
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the idea that to be,</v>

597
00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:39.990
<v Speaker 1>to be proper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're a desperate,</v>

598
00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:40.863
<v Speaker 1>even if you're the king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a sacred pattern of behavior </v>

599
00:31:45.611 --> 00:31:46.444
<v Speaker 1>that you must adhere to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the consequence of the </v>

600
00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:51.013
<v Speaker 1>congress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the gods deciding what the most </v>

601
00:31:52.781 --> 00:31:54.160
<v Speaker 1>effective mode of being is.</v>

602
00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:58.990
<v Speaker 1>It's staggeringly brilliant and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it took that story.</v>

603
00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:01.080
<v Speaker 1>We just have no idea how long that story</v>
<v Speaker 1>took.</v>

604
00:32:01.081 --> 00:32:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Do we merge?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's,</v>

605
00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.950
<v Speaker 1>it's the consequence of the full course </v>
<v Speaker 1>of human evolutionary history.</v>

606
00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are elements in it that are as old</v>

607
00:32:09.581 --> 00:32:12.570
<v Speaker 1>as mammals and maybe older than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

608
00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:13.413
<v Speaker 1>if you think about those patterns being </v>
<v Speaker 1>embedded in behavior long before they </v>

609
00:32:17.201 --> 00:32:19.750
<v Speaker 1>were abstracted out into </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations,</v>

610
00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.823
<v Speaker 1>it's unbelievably archaic and ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you have time at the great </v>

611
00:32:24.581 --> 00:32:27.460
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have absolutely the great father.</v>

612
00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:30.100
<v Speaker 1>You have margot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the archetypal son.</v>

613
00:32:30.101 --> 00:32:32.680
<v Speaker 1>You have king who's the negative element</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Marta,</v>

614
00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:33.903
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have the drama of all those </v>

615
00:32:36.221 --> 00:32:39.290
<v Speaker 1>characters interacting across time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

616
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:41.203
<v Speaker 1>that's the mythological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the mythological representation </v>

617
00:32:43.431 --> 00:32:44.264
<v Speaker 1>of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And tying that to tie it into the </v>

618
00:32:46.071 --> 00:32:47.810
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychology that we talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

619
00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:50.150
<v Speaker 1>we talked about anomaly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

620
00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:52.890
<v Speaker 1>And how normally you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

621
00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:54.153
<v Speaker 1>a box that you're in that is your world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that box doesn't contain everything </v>

622
00:32:58.911 --> 00:33:00.550
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things that are good at</v>

623
00:33:00.551 --> 00:33:02.870
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes they poked their head in </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a snake.</v>

624
00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:05.540
<v Speaker 1>And then that's disruptive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what do you do?</v>

625
00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:06.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>

626
00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:08.283
<v Speaker 1>you have to voluntarily encountered the </v>
<v Speaker 1>snake and either defeated or make </v>

627
00:33:11.991 --> 00:33:13.780
<v Speaker 1>something valuable out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

628
00:33:13.781 --> 00:33:14.614
<v Speaker 1>you could cower and hide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all that generally means the state </v>

629
00:33:16.491 --> 00:33:19.460
<v Speaker 1>grows and grows until there's hardly any</v>
<v Speaker 1>you in the box.</v>

630
00:33:19.461 --> 00:33:20.294
<v Speaker 1>And there's all snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually the best Damien </v>

631
00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:22.633
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so if the elder gods weren't so </v>

632
00:33:24.831 --> 00:33:28.850
<v Speaker 1>careless and had been paying attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hadn't killed absolute time,</v>

633
00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:30.380
<v Speaker 1>that would've stayed asleep the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

634
00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:32.130
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

635
00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:37.490
<v Speaker 1>So that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the level of isomorphism.</v>

636
00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:41.660
<v Speaker 1>So what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's fascinating,</v>

637
00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:46.720
<v Speaker 1>but I think inevitable is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>methodology reflects the physiology,</v>

638
00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.500
<v Speaker 1>but how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could it not?</v>

639
00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:51.500
<v Speaker 1>The physiology produced the mythology </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

640
00:33:51.501 --> 00:33:54.200
<v Speaker 1>of course that's going to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be a surprise.</v>

641
00:33:54.201 --> 00:33:55.880
<v Speaker 1>It should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be.</v>

642
00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.490
<v Speaker 1>We should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reverse should be a surprise.</v>

643
00:33:58.491 --> 00:34:00.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's no relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>between these,</v>

644
00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:02.660
<v Speaker 1>these old stories and the way that human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings are structured.</v>

645
00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:03.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

646
00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.000
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

647
00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:07.880
<v Speaker 1>that's a dumb idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

648
00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:16.013
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

649
00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.170
<v Speaker 1>that's the Mesopotamian creation myth </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

650
00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:19.400
<v Speaker 1>it's a killer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

651
00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:22.840
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a staggering story and you know,</v>

652
00:34:22.841 --> 00:34:24.880
<v Speaker 1>it still sits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether we know it or not,</v>

653
00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:29.770
<v Speaker 1>it sits at the very base of our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's absolute that story.</v>

654
00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:33.820
<v Speaker 1>And if we kill it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we will or have been,</v>

655
00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:37.380
<v Speaker 1>then then look out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

656
00:34:37.390 --> 00:34:38.223
<v Speaker 1>we know the story from so long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you let your culture die and act </v>

657
00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:44.363
<v Speaker 1>carelessly towards it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all hell will break loose and it's no </v>

658
00:34:47.471 --> 00:34:49.340
<v Speaker 1>joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

659
00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:51.933
<v Speaker 1>so here we are trying to revive a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty weird that these things </v>

660
00:34:59.671 --> 00:35:03.090
<v Speaker 1>happened to be real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then if you think about it,</v>

661
00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:04.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could it be otherwise?</v>

662
00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:06.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

663
00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:07.403
<v Speaker 1>you think all these people who lived </v>
<v Speaker 1>before us for the tens of millions of </v>

664
00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:16.370
<v Speaker 1>years that we've had are vaguely human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pre predessessors were stupid.</v>

665
00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:25.140
<v Speaker 1>They weren't and they weren't ignorant </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they weren't superstitious or any of</v>

666
00:35:25.141 --> 00:35:26.130
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were.</v>

667
00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:28.523
<v Speaker 1>They were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were tough enough so that we're </v>

668
00:35:30.001 --> 00:35:30.834
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
