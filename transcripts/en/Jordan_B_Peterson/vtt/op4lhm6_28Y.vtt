1
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.023
<v Speaker 1>We just launched support Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>research.com a crowdfunding campaign to </v>

2
00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:10.870
<v Speaker 1>pay for Professor Jordan Peterson is </v>
<v Speaker 1>academic research.</v>

3
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.303
<v Speaker 1>And then the first 24 hours we raised </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than an entire year's worth of </v>

4
00:00:16.271 --> 00:00:18.970
<v Speaker 1>research funding for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

5
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.510
<v Speaker 1>We did this because for the first time </v>
<v Speaker 1>in his 20 year career,</v>

6
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:23.613
<v Speaker 1>the government agency that hands out </v>
<v Speaker 1>research grants rejected his funding </v>

7
00:00:27.011 --> 00:00:27.844
<v Speaker 1>proposal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which just coincidentally came after he </v>

8
00:00:30.371 --> 00:00:32.770
<v Speaker 1>made headlines for fighting against </v>
<v Speaker 1>political correctness.</v>

9
00:00:32.771 --> 00:00:37.360
<v Speaker 1>Well what a poetic victory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're getting him that funding after all</v>

10
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.090
<v Speaker 1>and now he's more independent than ever.</v>

11
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.430
<v Speaker 2>Thanks very much for doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

12
00:00:42.431 --> 00:00:45.590
<v Speaker 2>it's working in an extraordinarily well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been sitting here,</v>

13
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.453
<v Speaker 2>I'm down in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do a talk at Harvard and a </v>

14
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.920
<v Speaker 2>on political correctness and access </v>
<v Speaker 2>compassion and free speech.</v>

15
00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:54.754
<v Speaker 2>And I've been sitting here watching the </v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers climb and I think there's more </v>

16
00:00:58.031 --> 00:01:00.880
<v Speaker 2>than 1500 people who are supporting my </v>
<v Speaker 2>research now.</v>

17
00:01:00.881 --> 00:01:01.714
<v Speaker 2>And we've gone past for first year of </v>
<v Speaker 2>funding already and I guess we're going </v>

18
00:01:05.321 --> 00:01:07.150
<v Speaker 2>to try it for the second year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

19
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.970
<v Speaker 2>it's remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

20
00:01:09.971 --> 00:01:12.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I,</v>

21
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.873
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to say except my </v>

22
00:01:16.211 --> 00:01:19.450
<v Speaker 2>graduate students are extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy about this because it solves their</v>

23
00:01:19.451 --> 00:01:22.240
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we'll continue our research and can</v>

24
00:01:22.241 --> 00:01:24.410
<v Speaker 2>just review that briefly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

25
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:25.443
<v Speaker 2>the research is aimed first of all at </v>
<v Speaker 2>improving the accuracy of the </v>

26
00:01:28.931 --> 00:01:31.960
<v Speaker 2>measurement of personality and we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>done some of some of that already.</v>

27
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.470
<v Speaker 2>Freaking the big five down into 10 sub </v>
<v Speaker 2>components.</v>

28
00:01:35.471 --> 00:01:37.780
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've looked at the relationship,</v>

29
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.153
<v Speaker 2>the subcomponents of conscientiousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>and broken it down into industriousness </v>

30
00:01:42.341 --> 00:01:44.500
<v Speaker 2>and orderliness and associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>orderliness,</v>

31
00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:45.334
<v Speaker 2>with disgust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity and look its role in </v>

32
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.650
<v Speaker 2>increasing the probability of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative beliefs.</v>

33
00:01:50.651 --> 00:01:51.484
<v Speaker 2>And we've looked at trade agreeableness </v>
<v Speaker 2>and compassionate in particular and </v>

34
00:01:55.451 --> 00:01:58.650
<v Speaker 2>examine its relationship to politically </v>
<v Speaker 2>correct leaf because it has,</v>

35
00:01:58.651 --> 00:01:59.484
<v Speaker 2>it seems to play a very strong role in </v>
<v Speaker 2>determining a proclivity for people to </v>

36
00:02:03.761 --> 00:02:04.594
<v Speaker 2>adopt politically correct for leafs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we'll continue that and also </v>

37
00:02:09.011 --> 00:02:09.844
<v Speaker 2>continue doing the basic research into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the development of programs like the </v>

38
00:02:12.461 --> 00:02:14.380
<v Speaker 2>self authoring suite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

39
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.243
<v Speaker 2>the future authoring portion of that has</v>
<v Speaker 2>already been demonstrated to raise </v>

40
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.200
<v Speaker 2>college students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grades five,</v>

41
00:02:20.201 --> 00:02:21.034
<v Speaker 2>about 25% decrease the dropout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we've got 1200 high school students </v>

42
00:02:25.691 --> 00:02:28.270
<v Speaker 2>lined up to try a high school version of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in the fall.</v>

43
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.103
<v Speaker 2>And we're very much looking forward to </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing if we can duplicate our success </v>

44
00:02:31.661 --> 00:02:33.280
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

45
00:02:33.281 --> 00:02:34.690
<v Speaker 2>it's quite remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

46
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:35.603
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to thank everybody thoroughly </v>

47
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.950
<v Speaker 2>for supporting this research and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and supporting me.</v>

48
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.010
<v Speaker 2>I find it amazing that if this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible even,</v>

49
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.420
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

50
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.090
<v Speaker 2>our way we go I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and once again thank you to,</v>

51
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.330
<v Speaker 2>to you and to everyone that's supporting</v>
<v Speaker 2>the research over to you as rough,</v>

52
00:02:58.331 --> 00:02:59.164
<v Speaker 2>we'll see how it goes over the next,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess we're gonna run this for a </v>

53
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 2>month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll see how it goes over the month,</v>

54
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.140
<v Speaker 2>next month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got lots of plans in the loud.</v>

55
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.513
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

56
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.350
<v Speaker 2>I think we can put the money to very </v>
<v Speaker 2>good use and use.</v>

57
00:03:09.351 --> 00:03:10.970
<v Speaker 2>That will be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you say?</v>

58
00:03:10.971 --> 00:03:11.804
<v Speaker 2>It's not only scientifically valid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but hopefully that will have a broad </v>

59
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 2>scale impact on practically speaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>because as a clinical psychologist,</v>

60
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:19.924
<v Speaker 2>I like to conduct research that's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be abroad practical benefit as well </v>

61
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 2>as theoretical and scientific utility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

62
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Speaker 2>thanks again already.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

64
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.420
<v Speaker 1>All the net proceeds will be sent to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Professor Peterson.</v>

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.163
<v Speaker 1>Let's set our sights on the stretch goal</v>
<v Speaker 1>of funding the second year of his </v>

71
00:03:58.921 --> 00:03:59.754
<v Speaker 1>recent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember it was a five year application </v>
