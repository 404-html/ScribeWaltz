1
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.740
<v Speaker 1>I started to talk to you about trait</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory and now I'm going to make a jump</v>

2
00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:21.741
<v Speaker 1>to biology and that's a strange jump in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense because the two levels of</v>

3
00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:26.901
<v Speaker 1>analysis are relatively disconnected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's happening right now at,</v>

4
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.110
<v Speaker 1>at the sort of outer echelons of</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality research is that</v>

5
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.680
<v Speaker 1>the workers at the forefront of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>field are trying to integrate what's</v>

6
00:00:38.681 --> 00:00:42.640
<v Speaker 1>been established at the statistical</v>
<v Speaker 1>level of analysis with what's known at</v>

7
00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:46.990
<v Speaker 1>the psychobiological level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this emerging science is known as</v>

8
00:00:46.991 --> 00:00:48.530
<v Speaker 1>personality neuroscience and</v>

9
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:50.283
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

10
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.420
<v Speaker 1>it's developed in a rather strange way</v>
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

11
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.370
<v Speaker 1>the trades that were identified that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed with you on Tuesday,</v>

12
00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:04.371
<v Speaker 1>the big five traits all emerged as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of this statistical analysis</v>

13
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of descriptors characteristic mostly of</v>

14
00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:11.070
<v Speaker 1>the English language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although it's been duplicated in other</v>

15
00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:16.071
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense it was in a theoretical</v>

16
00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:17.310
<v Speaker 1>model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

17
00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:22.311
<v Speaker 1>It just came out of the linguistic data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was no real initial inferences</v>

18
00:01:24.691 --> 00:01:27.360
<v Speaker 1>about brain area or neurological</v>
<v Speaker 1>activity or,</v>

19
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.620
<v Speaker 1>or anything like that to drive the</v>
<v Speaker 1>formulation of the big five model.</v>

20
00:01:30.621 --> 00:01:33.390
<v Speaker 1>And instead of the big five model came</v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

21
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.380
<v Speaker 1>And then people started thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

22
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.120
<v Speaker 1>can this be put into alignment with what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know about the brain?</v>

23
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.990
<v Speaker 1>And so people have been hitting that</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty hard,</v>

24
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.940
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over about the last.</v>

25
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.690
<v Speaker 1>It's probably 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that because Hans,</v>

26
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.170
<v Speaker 1>I zinc and and his student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeffrey Gray,</v>

27
00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.980
<v Speaker 1>we're pretty far along on this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking by say 1982 when gray published</v>

28
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:04.260
<v Speaker 1>his book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the neuropsychology of anxiety,</v>

29
00:02:04.261 --> 00:02:09.261
<v Speaker 1>which the paper you're reading now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a model of the limbic system and Basal</v>

30
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Ganglia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basal Ganglia applications to anxiety</v>

31
00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:13.860
<v Speaker 1>and schizophrenia.</v>

32
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.200
<v Speaker 1>That's a very short summary of the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That gray published in 1982,</v>

33
00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:24.201
<v Speaker 1>which has been incredibly influential if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're interested in going on in</v>

34
00:02:24.421 --> 00:02:26.400
<v Speaker 1>psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially on the scientific end,</v>

35
00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:30.210
<v Speaker 1>but I would say pretty much regardless</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're interested in going on in</v>

36
00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:31.200
<v Speaker 1>psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a.</v>

37
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.890
<v Speaker 1>that's a very useful book to tackle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a newer version that was</v>

38
00:02:34.891 --> 00:02:38.190
<v Speaker 1>published by gray and Mcnaughton and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think 2000,</v>

39
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.740
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard going like,</v>

40
00:02:40.741 --> 00:02:43.710
<v Speaker 1>and you may have found the paper that</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to gray was a very,</v>

41
00:02:43.711 --> 00:02:46.050
<v Speaker 1>very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately he died a few years ago.</v>

42
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.430
<v Speaker 1>He was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart person and he knew the animal</v>

43
00:02:50.431 --> 00:02:52.110
<v Speaker 1>literature on behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuro,</v>

44
00:02:52.111 --> 00:02:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroanatomy and neuropsychopharmacology</v>

45
00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:58.830
<v Speaker 1>inside out and backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so whenever he defined a term,</v>

46
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.820
<v Speaker 1>he always made sure that the term was</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligible at a behavioral level and</v>

47
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:06.970
<v Speaker 1>at an anatomical level and at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmacological level.</v>

48
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.270
<v Speaker 1>It had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>the ideas that he were developing had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sense that these multiple levels of</v>

50
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 1>analysis before he would accept them as</v>
<v Speaker 1>as genuine and gray,</v>

51
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:20.851
<v Speaker 1>did a remarkable job of extending our</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge of the biological and the</v>

52
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:26.641
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary basis of at least the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>two personality traits say extroversion</v>

53
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:29.290
<v Speaker 1>and neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly corresponding to positive and</v>

54
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:31.330
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm.</v>

55
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.460
<v Speaker 1>So that's partly why you're reading grey</v>
<v Speaker 1>and grey theories.</v>

56
00:03:36.461 --> 00:03:37.960
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cybernetic theory.</v>

57
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.180
<v Speaker 1>Cybernetic theory is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a variation of a theory developed by</v>

58
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 1>an mit cognitive scientist named Norbert</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wiener,</v>

59
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:50.740
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was an early ai artificial</v>

60
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:53.530
<v Speaker 1>intelligence researcher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he proposed that,</v>

61
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.350
<v Speaker 1>that that intelligent entities were goal</v>
<v Speaker 1>directed and that they organized their</v>

62
00:03:59.441 --> 00:04:04.441
<v Speaker 1>behavior around reducing deviations from</v>
<v Speaker 1>a goal while they were approaching it.</v>

63
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:10.741
<v Speaker 1>Once they had decided what it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's also proved to be incredibly</v>

64
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.093
<v Speaker 1>influential.</v>

65
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk a fair bit about cybernetic</v>

66
00:04:14.381 --> 00:04:18.460
<v Speaker 1>models as we progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So gray is sort of a combination of</v>

67
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:21.550
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cybernetic theorizing,</v>

68
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.510
<v Speaker 1>and then an incredible amount of data</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's come in from animal behavioral</v>

69
00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:27.430
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I'm concerned,</v>

70
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:31.000
<v Speaker 1>most of the things that we know about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain have been derived from animal</v>

71
00:04:31.001 --> 00:04:32.170
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

72
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.230
<v Speaker 1>the animal researchers tended to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily careful.</v>

73
00:04:35.231 --> 00:04:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were influenced by a,</v>

74
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.680
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

75
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.460
<v Speaker 1>b bf skinner who established the sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the initial</v>

76
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.110
<v Speaker 1>theoretical basis for understanding how</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals learn.</v>

77
00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:49.930
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk about that a little bit next</v>
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

78
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.610
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

79
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.850
<v Speaker 1>that's the context within which gray is</v>
<v Speaker 1>working.</v>

80
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Ledoux,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are all papers you're going to</v>

81
00:04:57.221 --> 00:04:59.680
<v Speaker 1>read except the third one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is optional.</v>

82
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Ledoux is also a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an emotional.</v>

83
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.190
<v Speaker 1>He's an an affective neuroscientist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's as someone who studies emotions</v>

84
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.241
<v Speaker 1>mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

85
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:12.220
<v Speaker 1>animals and do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has done a lot to sort of add some of</v>

86
00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:14.560
<v Speaker 1>the pieces that were missing in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in gray.</v>

87
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Gray probably concentrated a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much on a brain area called the</v>

88
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:20.620
<v Speaker 1>hippocampus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the brain area that sort of</v>

89
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.700
<v Speaker 1>lets you know if it's reasonable to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>calm where you're currently situated and</v>

90
00:05:28.241 --> 00:05:32.650
<v Speaker 1>so what the hippocampus does in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>senses compare what it is that you want</v>

91
00:05:32.651 --> 00:05:36.640
<v Speaker 1>to have happen with what is happening</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if the two things are the same,</v>

92
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.260
<v Speaker 1>then you're calm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a match mismatch detector and it</v>

93
00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:46.000
<v Speaker 1>has access not only to memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also to formulations of say the</v>

94
00:05:46.001 --> 00:05:48.300
<v Speaker 1>desired future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>M</v>

95
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.340
<v Speaker 1>Swanson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had people read the Swanson paper last</v>

96
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.840
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've put it in your reading list is</v>

97
00:05:55.841 --> 00:05:59.510
<v Speaker 1>optional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's worth hacking through if you can</v>

98
00:05:59.511 --> 00:06:01.460
<v Speaker 1>manage it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard paper though,</v>

99
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.280
<v Speaker 1>which is why it took it out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>required reading list.</v>

100
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:06.590
<v Speaker 1>The reason I liked Swanson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk a fair bit about him</v>

101
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:10.430
<v Speaker 1>today is</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swanson's not a psychologist.</v>

102
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.430
<v Speaker 1>He's actually a developmental neuro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can never say this properly.</v>

103
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.300
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he studies developmental anatomy.</v>

104
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.350
<v Speaker 1>We'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll do that.</v>

105
00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so he's very interested in how the</v>

106
00:06:24.171 --> 00:06:28.010
<v Speaker 1>brain unfolds across time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during embryonic development and then up</v>

107
00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:33.011
<v Speaker 1>into maturity and so he understands the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain differently than a psychologist</v>

108
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.750
<v Speaker 1>because the psychologist tends to</v>
<v Speaker 1>analyze the brain,</v>

109
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a sort of mature thing usually in</v>

110
00:06:38.271 --> 00:06:39.104
<v Speaker 1>adulthood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

111
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.100
<v Speaker 1>but for Swanson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a much more living and transforming</v>

112
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:48.101
<v Speaker 1>system and he's trying to set forth a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Schema for understanding brain anatomy</v>

113
00:06:50.661 --> 00:06:52.760
<v Speaker 1>and also associating that with function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:06:52.761 --> 00:06:56.570
<v Speaker 1>and you might think that that's a well</v>
<v Speaker 1>advanced science already that we know</v>

115
00:06:56.571 --> 00:07:01.571
<v Speaker 1>how to segment up to the brain and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>know roughly what the piece is due,</v>

116
00:07:01.791 --> 00:07:06.290
<v Speaker 1>but we haven't even really managed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>establish the terminology pro property</v>

117
00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:08.100
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very narrow.</v>

118
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Neuroscience is a very new field and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's no limit to the number of</v>

119
00:07:14.031 --> 00:07:17.630
<v Speaker 1>things that we don't know about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including even the basic classification</v>

120
00:07:17.631 --> 00:07:18.020
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

121
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.280
<v Speaker 1>Now Swanson has put forth a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent basic classification</v>

122
00:07:22.281 --> 00:07:24.190
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason that I think it's</v>

123
00:07:24.191 --> 00:07:29.191
<v Speaker 1>so relevant to a personality class is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it maps in a beautiful way onto</v>

124
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.870
<v Speaker 1>some of the things that we've already</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about,</v>

125
00:07:32.871 --> 00:07:36.230
<v Speaker 1>especially piaget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a nice direct mapping of</v>

126
00:07:36.231 --> 00:07:41.231
<v Speaker 1>Piaget's developmental theory onto</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swanson's theory of neurodevelopment and</v>

127
00:07:41.271 --> 00:07:44.930
<v Speaker 1>then have neural function and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely accidental because Swanson</v>

128
00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:48.440
<v Speaker 1>never cites piaget so they're non</v>
<v Speaker 1>overlapping literatures and I kind of</v>

129
00:07:48.441 --> 00:07:50.180
<v Speaker 1>liked that because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

130
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:54.080
<v Speaker 1>if something pops up in one place with</v>
<v Speaker 1>one method and pops up another place</v>

131
00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:58.070
<v Speaker 1>with a completely different method,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if those two places are</v>

132
00:07:58.071 --> 00:08:00.560
<v Speaker 1>distinct in terms of their historical</v>
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>

133
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.110
<v Speaker 1>you might start thinking there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually something there.</v>

134
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sort of like seeing something and</v>

135
00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:08.240
<v Speaker 1>hearing it at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got two independent sources of</v>

136
00:08:08.241 --> 00:08:08.900
<v Speaker 1>data.</v>

137
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like triangulation in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it was very exciting to me to</v>

138
00:08:12.891 --> 00:08:16.200
<v Speaker 1>come across this paper by Swanson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

139
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.220
<v Speaker 1>he's one of only two scientists I ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote a fan letter too.</v>

140
00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean really it's a brilliant paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then</v>

141
00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.850
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's other reasons why it maps onto</v>

142
00:08:25.851 --> 00:08:29.060
<v Speaker 1>what we're going to talk about too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Swanson also points out quite</v>

143
00:08:29.061 --> 00:08:33.290
<v Speaker 1>clearly the function of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of roughly separates the</v>

144
00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:37.880
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus into two halves and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he points out that they have quite</v>

145
00:08:37.881 --> 00:08:41.240
<v Speaker 1>distinct functions and the functions</v>
<v Speaker 1>also map onto some of the things that</v>

146
00:08:41.241 --> 00:08:43.130
<v Speaker 1>we've been talking about it in a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>lovely way.</v>

147
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:48.050
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a lot of reasons to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go through Swanson's paper carefully,</v>

148
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like 50 pages long,</v>

149
00:08:50.751 --> 00:08:55.160
<v Speaker 1>but the guy put it in some senses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole life's work is in those 50 pages,</v>

150
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:59.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it takes you 12 hours or 20</v>

151
00:08:59.131 --> 00:09:01.560
<v Speaker 1>hours to read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's not too bad if you're</v>

152
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.130
<v Speaker 1>going to extract out like 30 years of</v>
<v Speaker 1>solid research.</v>

153
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Gray's book is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you read that book you've got,</v>

154
00:09:10.291 --> 00:09:14.280
<v Speaker 1>if you read it and understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've basically got a fair chunk of</v>

155
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:19.230
<v Speaker 1>neuroanatomy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of animal behavioral analysis.</v>

156
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:24.530
<v Speaker 1>So I'm behaviorism in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of psychopharmacology and a lot of</v>

157
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:31.040
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the functional</v>
<v Speaker 1>significance of the brain's major</v>

158
00:09:31.141 --> 00:09:33.870
<v Speaker 1>neurotransmitter systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get all that from gray's book,</v>

159
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.310
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a killer book,</v>

160
00:09:35.311 --> 00:09:37.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can extract all that out.</v>

161
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:41.340
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carver and Scheier also take a</v>

162
00:09:41.341 --> 00:09:43.590
<v Speaker 1>cybernetic perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>

163
00:09:43.591 --> 00:09:46.850
<v Speaker 1>they're more cognitive scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to find their paper a</v>

164
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:51.150
<v Speaker 1>little bit farther down the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're also very interested in how</v>

165
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:56.310
<v Speaker 1>creatures human beings in particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>select goals and then align themselves</v>

166
00:09:56.311 --> 00:09:58.590
<v Speaker 1>with those goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for our purposes,</v>

167
00:09:58.591 --> 00:10:02.520
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk a fair bit about</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation today and the distinction</v>

168
00:10:02.521 --> 00:10:04.980
<v Speaker 1>between motivation and emotion is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>clear.</v>

169
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.700
<v Speaker 1>They're both words that sort of function</v>
<v Speaker 1>within an linguistic context,</v>

170
00:10:08.701 --> 00:10:12.630
<v Speaker 1>but for the sake of argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course all the emotions aren't</v>

171
00:10:12.631 --> 00:10:14.850
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like there's one circuit that</v>

172
00:10:14.851 --> 00:10:17.580
<v Speaker 1>subsumes emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's multiple circuits that subsume</v>

173
00:10:17.581 --> 00:10:20.400
<v Speaker 1>emotion and they're not identical</v>
<v Speaker 1>circuits,</v>

174
00:10:20.401 --> 00:10:22.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it isn't like every emotion is a</v>

175
00:10:22.921 --> 00:10:25.320
<v Speaker 1>variant of the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

176
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.010
<v Speaker 1>It's the same with the motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're very loose groupings,</v>

177
00:10:29.011 --> 00:10:33.060
<v Speaker 1>motivation and emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for the purposes of our argument,</v>

178
00:10:33.061 --> 00:10:36.630
<v Speaker 1>we're going to make this case roughly</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations,</v>

179
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:42.200
<v Speaker 1>set goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and roughly emotions orient you in</v>

180
00:10:42.451 --> 00:10:44.490
<v Speaker 1>relationship to those goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

181
00:10:44.491 --> 00:10:46.350
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those categories overlap.</v>

182
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:49.770
<v Speaker 1>Anger is usually considered an emotion</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it often has a goal,</v>

183
00:10:49.771 --> 00:10:52.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The goal is to hit something or hurt</v>

184
00:10:52.051 --> 00:10:53.550
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

185
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:58.050
<v Speaker 1>that's one possible goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so emotions can segway quite easily into</v>

186
00:10:58.051 --> 00:10:59.880
<v Speaker 1>motivational states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>

187
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.500
<v Speaker 1>You got to use a category system of some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort to clear clarify things,</v>

188
00:11:04.501 --> 00:11:05.610
<v Speaker 1>and so that's what we're going to.</v>

189
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:09.480
<v Speaker 1>We're going to a pursuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Motivations set goals.</v>

190
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.850
<v Speaker 1>It's actually more complicated than</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

191
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I showed you that little oval diagram</v>

192
00:11:14.251 --> 00:11:17.760
<v Speaker 1>with a desired future and unbearable</v>
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>

193
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:21.180
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Motivations actually don't just set</v>

194
00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:25.200
<v Speaker 1>goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also prime behavior and they also</v>

195
00:11:25.201 --> 00:11:28.440
<v Speaker 1>set up the perceptual frame within which</v>
<v Speaker 1>you interpret the world.</v>

196
00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:32.310
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're hungry and it isn't just that</v>

197
00:11:32.311 --> 00:11:34.860
<v Speaker 1>you're driven to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

198
00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:38.130
<v Speaker 1>eating is a very complex behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's associated with food</v>

199
00:11:38.131 --> 00:11:42.150
<v Speaker 1>preparation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say you're the systems that you've used</v>

200
00:11:42.151 --> 00:11:47.151
<v Speaker 1>in the past to procure food and then to</v>
<v Speaker 1>ingest it are sort of disinhibited by</v>

201
00:11:48.121 --> 00:11:51.330
<v Speaker 1>the motivational state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're at the ready and then your</v>

202
00:11:51.331 --> 00:11:55.630
<v Speaker 1>sensory system is tuned so that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to focus on those things that are</v>

203
00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:58.240
<v Speaker 1>relevant to eating and tune out</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>

204
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:02.560
<v Speaker 1>So the motivational state also does</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptual tuning and then there's a</v>

205
00:12:02.561 --> 00:12:04.480
<v Speaker 1>felt component of it as well.</v>

206
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:09.160
<v Speaker 1>So it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not reasonable to only say that</v>

207
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.850
<v Speaker 1>motivation sets goals or that it drives</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

208
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:14.590
<v Speaker 1>It does three things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goal setting,</v>

209
00:12:14.591 --> 00:12:18.580
<v Speaker 1>behavioral driving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus it provides a perceptual schema</v>

210
00:12:18.581 --> 00:12:20.620
<v Speaker 1>within which those other two things make</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

211
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:25.300
<v Speaker 1>And so a motivated state in some sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like a little micro personality.</v>

212
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:29.590
<v Speaker 1>It's only got one aim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of a one eyed micro</v>

213
00:12:29.591 --> 00:12:30.580
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

214
00:12:30.581 --> 00:12:33.970
<v Speaker 1>so it's only aiming at one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it still has all the other aspects</v>

215
00:12:33.971 --> 00:12:35.650
<v Speaker 1>of personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

216
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.890
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

217
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.050
<v Speaker 1>for me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that aligns nicely with the</v>

218
00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:43.060
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic idea that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

219
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:43.990
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

220
00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:49.410
<v Speaker 1>you're a loose aggregation of multiple</v>
<v Speaker 1>fragmented personalities,</v>

221
00:12:49.841 --> 00:12:51.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's Sorta coherently tied together</v>

222
00:12:51.791 --> 00:12:54.550
<v Speaker 1>at the highest level of analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can go off and do their own</v>

223
00:12:54.551 --> 00:12:56.290
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that in situations,</v>

224
00:12:56.291 --> 00:12:59.110
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like eating disorders where the hunger</v>

225
00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:03.940
<v Speaker 1>system itself starts to become almost a</v>
<v Speaker 1>spun off part of the personality and the</v>

226
00:13:03.941 --> 00:13:04.840
<v Speaker 1>rest of the personality.</v>

227
00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:09.190
<v Speaker 1>Then wars with that and that sort of in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense that's like cortex versus</v>

228
00:13:09.191 --> 00:13:13.600
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus and you never win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>CORTEX does not win over hypothalamus.</v>

229
00:13:13.601 --> 00:13:15.340
<v Speaker 1>The hypothalamus is what keeps you</v>
<v Speaker 1>alive,</v>

230
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.490
<v Speaker 1>so it's one of the things that keeps you</v>
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

231
00:13:18.491 --> 00:13:21.250
<v Speaker 1>You could do without your cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you cannot do without your</v>

232
00:13:21.251 --> 00:13:25.060
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus and the connections</v>
<v Speaker 1>stretching upwards from the</v>

233
00:13:25.061 --> 00:13:27.310
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very old brain area,</v>

234
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:31.840
<v Speaker 1>are much more powerful than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>connections coming down from the Cortex</v>

235
00:13:31.841 --> 00:13:35.020
<v Speaker 1>to modulate the hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's another indication of just</v>

236
00:13:35.021 --> 00:13:37.300
<v Speaker 1>exactly who's in charge when the chips</v>
<v Speaker 1>are down.</v>

237
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:39.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why it's so hard for you to</v>

238
00:13:39.101 --> 00:13:42.670
<v Speaker 1>override your basic emotions or</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational states.</v>

239
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:47.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like the system evolved to keep you</v>
<v Speaker 1>alive and it's not particularly willing</v>

240
00:13:47.351 --> 00:13:52.351
<v Speaker 1>to give up control in a sense given that</v>
<v Speaker 1>your survival is staked on its function.</v>

241
00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:56.350
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's useful to know that because you</v>

242
00:13:56.351 --> 00:13:56.751
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

243
00:13:56.751 --> 00:13:57.584
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

244
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.720
<v Speaker 1>if you pursue psychology and you stay</v>
<v Speaker 1>within the human side of psychology,</v>

245
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:04.930
<v Speaker 1>say instead of wandering off into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal behavioral research,</v>

246
00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:10.060
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that most human psychologists</v>
<v Speaker 1>and neuropsychologists are very cortical</v>

247
00:14:10.061 --> 00:14:12.250
<v Speaker 1>centric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really like to think that it's the</v>

248
00:14:12.251 --> 00:14:16.270
<v Speaker 1>newly evolved parts of the brain that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in charge and that's just not right.</v>

249
00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:21.510
<v Speaker 1>The newly evolved parts of the brain are</v>
<v Speaker 1>in charge only when nothing is bothering</v>

250
00:14:21.731 --> 00:14:23.440
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're not hungry,</v>

251
00:14:23.441 --> 00:14:25.750
<v Speaker 1>you're not thirsty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not too excited,</v>

252
00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:28.030
<v Speaker 1>you're not too curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not too terrified.</v>

253
00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:31.300
<v Speaker 1>You know you're not too cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not too warm any of those,</v>

254
00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:36.720
<v Speaker 1>then the cortex is in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you deviate substantially across</v>

255
00:14:36.881 --> 00:14:40.900
<v Speaker 1>any of those dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that control over your</v>

256
00:14:40.901 --> 00:14:44.230
<v Speaker 1>behavioral output in your perceptions is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to devolve down.</v>

257
00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:48.400
<v Speaker 1>The evolutionary hierarchy to more</v>
<v Speaker 1>primordial brain areas is extremely</v>

258
00:14:48.401 --> 00:14:49.440
<v Speaker 1>likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

259
00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.680
<v Speaker 1>when you see the same thing happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

260
00:14:51.681 --> 00:14:53.540
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're having a discussion with</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

261
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:56.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they exhaust the limits of your</v>

262
00:14:56.961 --> 00:15:00.170
<v Speaker 1>rational knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means basically they out argue you</v>

263
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens?</v>

264
00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:05.630
<v Speaker 1>Well usually what happens is that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>cry or they get angry and it's like</v>

265
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.170
<v Speaker 1>they're out of cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bang right down to the more,</v>

266
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:13.370
<v Speaker 1>the lower and more primary</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionarily determined systems.</v>

267
00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:14.660
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

268
00:15:14.661 --> 00:15:16.590
<v Speaker 1>now we're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna.</v>

269
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:20.390
<v Speaker 1>Take a look at how the brain functions</v>
<v Speaker 1>in general and so we're going to start</v>

270
00:15:20.391 --> 00:15:22.130
<v Speaker 1>pretty general and then we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go narrow.</v>

271
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:27.320
<v Speaker 1>And the first thing that you might want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think about is what problem exactly</v>

272
00:15:27.321 --> 00:15:32.321
<v Speaker 1>is the brain wrestling with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the major problem is that reality is</v>

273
00:15:32.571 --> 00:15:37.070
<v Speaker 1>so complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has so many layers and so many</v>

274
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:42.520
<v Speaker 1>interconnected causal links that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex beyond comprehension.</v>

275
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.290
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

276
00:15:45.291 --> 00:15:47.690
<v Speaker 1>you think about all the subatomic</v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity,</v>

277
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.470
<v Speaker 1>that's a horrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's the complexity at the</v>

278
00:15:51.471 --> 00:15:53.250
<v Speaker 1>atomic level and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

279
00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:55.610
<v Speaker 1>pretty overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the molecular level</v>

280
00:15:55.611 --> 00:15:57.710
<v Speaker 1>which makes the atomic level looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>simple.</v>

281
00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:02.870
<v Speaker 1>And then there's all the comp</v>
<v Speaker 1>exceedingly complex structures that</v>

282
00:16:02.871 --> 00:16:05.810
<v Speaker 1>emerge out of the molecular level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in living organisms.</v>

283
00:16:05.811 --> 00:16:08.750
<v Speaker 1>So that would be roughly at the organ</v>
<v Speaker 1>level of existence,</v>

284
00:16:08.751 --> 00:16:11.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's you as a totality with</v>

285
00:16:11.361 --> 00:16:12.890
<v Speaker 1>your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

286
00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:16.820
<v Speaker 1>and the brain is so much more complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>than everything else in the universe</v>

287
00:16:16.821 --> 00:16:20.270
<v Speaker 1>that it's not even in the same category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are estimates,</v>

288
00:16:20.271 --> 00:16:21.830
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by Gerald Edelman,</v>

289
00:16:21.831 --> 00:16:23.840
<v Speaker 1>that there are more connections in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>

290
00:16:23.841 --> 00:16:27.680
<v Speaker 1>more patterns of connections in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain than there are subatomic particles</v>

291
00:16:27.681 --> 00:16:29.120
<v Speaker 1>in the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

292
00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:31.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one major league complex thing</v>

293
00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:33.620
<v Speaker 1>and there's lots of them around and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

294
00:16:33.621 --> 00:16:36.860
<v Speaker 1>they're all integrated into families.</v>

295
00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.210
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

296
00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly tribal grouping,</v>

297
00:16:41.601 --> 00:16:43.700
<v Speaker 1>some of which get large enough to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>nations.</v>

298
00:16:43.701 --> 00:16:47.030
<v Speaker 1>And then that's all embedded inside of</v>
<v Speaker 1>some biological system.</v>

299
00:16:47.031 --> 00:16:50.750
<v Speaker 1>And so on and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way out to the limits of the</v>

300
00:16:50.751 --> 00:16:51.590
<v Speaker 1>cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

301
00:16:51.591 --> 00:16:55.190
<v Speaker 1>this is one complicated place and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

302
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.640
<v Speaker 1>your job in large part is to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

303
00:16:58.641 --> 00:17:03.020
<v Speaker 1>but also not to become overwhelmed by it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have to simplify it down to</v>

304
00:17:03.021 --> 00:17:06.710
<v Speaker 1>the point where you can sort of think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about one thing and do one thing.</v>

305
00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:11.980
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to screen all of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>out so that the complexity complexity</v>

306
00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:16.460
<v Speaker 1>doesn't overwhelm you when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>attempting to do anything,</v>

307
00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:19.640
<v Speaker 1>anything simple even to look at yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the mirror,</v>

308
00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.070
<v Speaker 1>which is also a very complicated thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

309
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:27.230
<v Speaker 1>Part of the problem your brain is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is always facing is</v>

310
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.470
<v Speaker 1>what can I ignore?</v>

311
00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:32.360
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

312
00:17:32.361 --> 00:17:33.970
<v Speaker 1>you need to ignore almost everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

313
00:17:33.971 --> 00:17:36.350
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem because of course it's</v>

314
00:17:36.351 --> 00:17:40.490
<v Speaker 1>not always obvious what it's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's okay for you to ignore,</v>

315
00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:43.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that changes on you suddenly too</v>

316
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:45.800
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have imperfect knowledge,</v>

317
00:17:45.801 --> 00:17:49.070
<v Speaker 1>you may think something's irrelevant and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out to be of critical.</v>

318
00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:53.610
<v Speaker 1>So it's a deadly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deadly difficult problems.</v>

319
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:58.970
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the ways that we solve</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is we're actually pretty blind to,</v>

320
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.900
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to almost everything.</v>

321
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:05.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our sensory input is limited by our</v>

322
00:18:05.311 --> 00:18:07.320
<v Speaker 1>physiological limitations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly.</v>

323
00:18:07.321 --> 00:18:09.410
<v Speaker 1>So there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of visions,</v>

324
00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:13.260
<v Speaker 1>we only see a very small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little slice of the whole</v>

325
00:18:13.261 --> 00:18:16.260
<v Speaker 1>electromagnetic spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same with sounds.</v>

326
00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:18.330
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can only touch things that are</v>

327
00:18:18.331 --> 00:18:22.060
<v Speaker 1>basically within our reach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that limits things substantially.</v>

328
00:18:22.061 --> 00:18:24.120
<v Speaker 1>And then there are also things we can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>detect,</v>

329
00:18:24.121 --> 00:18:26.910
<v Speaker 1>like we're not very good at detecting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

330
00:18:26.911 --> 00:18:31.830
<v Speaker 1>we don't have the same ability that say</v>
<v Speaker 1>a platypuses and some fish can detect</v>

331
00:18:31.831 --> 00:18:34.200
<v Speaker 1>electromagnetic disturbances around</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

332
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.200
<v Speaker 1>on their skin and like their senses that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have.</v>

333
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:41.010
<v Speaker 1>So we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're narrowed a fair bit by what it is</v>

334
00:18:41.011 --> 00:18:42.950
<v Speaker 1>that we're able to perceive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

335
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:48.110
<v Speaker 1>and we're actually narrowed in what we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can perceive far more than anybody ever.</v>

336
00:18:48.241 --> 00:18:49.770
<v Speaker 1>Guests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to show you a little video</v>

337
00:18:49.771 --> 00:18:50.604
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

338
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:56.630
<v Speaker 3>The monkey business illusion</v>
<v Speaker 3>count how many times the players wearing</v>

339
00:18:57.331 --> 00:19:02.331
<v Speaker 3>white pass the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The correct answer is 16 passes.</v>

340
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:41.350
<v Speaker 3>Did you spot the gorilla</v>
<v Speaker 3>for people who haven't seen or heard</v>

341
00:19:41.801 --> 00:19:45.310
<v Speaker 3>about a video like this before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about half miss the gorilla.</v>

342
00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.920
<v Speaker 3>If you knew about the gorilla,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you probably saw it,</v>

343
00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:54.700
<v Speaker 3>but did you notice the curtain changing</v>
<v Speaker 3>color or the player on the black team</v>

344
00:19:54.701 --> 00:19:59.701
<v Speaker 3>leaving the game?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's rewind and watch it again.</v>

345
00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:08.390
<v Speaker 3>Here comes the gorilla and there goes a</v>
<v Speaker 3>player.</v>

346
00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.610
<v Speaker 3>And the curtain is changing from red to</v>
<v Speaker 3>gold.</v>

347
00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:20.520
<v Speaker 3>When you're looking for a gorilla,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you often miss other unexpected events.</v>

348
00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:27.720
<v Speaker 3>And that's the monkey business illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Learn more about this illusion and the</v>

349
00:20:28.321 --> 00:20:31.860
<v Speaker 3>original gorilla</v>
<v Speaker 3>experiment@theinvisiblegorilla.com.</v>

350
00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:35.240
<v Speaker 1>So how many of you saw the gorilla?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

351
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:38.800
<v Speaker 1>let's do the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

352
00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:43.980
<v Speaker 1>How many of you had not known about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>video beforehand?</v>

353
00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gorilla part of it.</v>

354
00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:46.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you guys don't count now.</v>

355
00:20:46.921 --> 00:20:48.850
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get someone who's seen it before and</v>

356
00:20:48.851 --> 00:20:51.070
<v Speaker 1>they still miss the damn gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty funny.</v>

357
00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:52.360
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

358
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.960
<v Speaker 1>but of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simon then Simon set this up because his</v>

359
00:20:55.961 --> 00:21:00.580
<v Speaker 1>original video got so popular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>virally popular that everybody has seen</v>

360
00:21:00.581 --> 00:21:04.330
<v Speaker 1>the invisible gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now he's showing you that while</v>

361
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.640
<v Speaker 1>you think you're smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been clued in to how blind you</v>

362
00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:08.320
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out you're not any smarter</v>

363
00:21:08.321 --> 00:21:09.580
<v Speaker 1>than you were to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

364
00:21:09.581 --> 00:21:12.850
<v Speaker 1>So how many people saw all three things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that changed?</v>

365
00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:15.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've seen it before.</v>

366
00:21:15.741 --> 00:21:16.161
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

367
00:21:16.161 --> 00:21:17.120
<v Speaker 1>And how many didn't?</v>

368
00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:18.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

369
00:21:18.841 --> 00:21:22.650
<v Speaker 1>So the vast majority of you missed one</v>
<v Speaker 1>or more of the things that changed now</v>

370
00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.850
<v Speaker 1>in the not really trivial things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the disappearance of a person from six</v>

371
00:21:26.851 --> 00:21:30.870
<v Speaker 1>people that's fairly major and you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole background changed color and</v>

372
00:21:30.871 --> 00:21:33.420
<v Speaker 1>you might think you'd clue into that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

373
00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:38.250
<v Speaker 1>So the weird thing is even when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>primed to notice what you're supposed to</v>

374
00:21:38.251 --> 00:21:41.250
<v Speaker 1>notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say count the balls and you</v>

375
00:21:41.251 --> 00:21:43.170
<v Speaker 1>know that something weird is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>

376
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:45.900
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That still doesn't prime you enough so</v>

377
00:21:45.901 --> 00:21:49.530
<v Speaker 1>that you can keep track of all the weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are happening and like this</v>

378
00:21:49.531 --> 00:21:53.740
<v Speaker 1>was an absolutely staggering experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When when it was first shown people,</v>

379
00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:58.170
<v Speaker 1>the psychologists were just like knocked</v>
<v Speaker 1>over by it because the hypothesis up to</v>

380
00:21:58.171 --> 00:22:02.130
<v Speaker 1>that point had been always that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could concentrate on what you were</v>

381
00:22:02.131 --> 00:22:02.850
<v Speaker 1>concentrating on.</v>

382
00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:05.310
<v Speaker 1>But if something anomalous or unexpected</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>

383
00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:07.890
<v Speaker 1>your attention would be automatically</v>
<v Speaker 1>devoted towards it.</v>

384
00:22:07.891 --> 00:22:09.420
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's what people would</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

385
00:22:09.421 --> 00:22:11.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd think that if you're watching</v>

386
00:22:11.041 --> 00:22:16.041
<v Speaker 1>people play basketball and a gorilla</v>
<v Speaker 1>walks into the area and it's not small,</v>

387
00:22:17.731 --> 00:22:21.240
<v Speaker 1>that of course you'd be surprised and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd see it if it turns out that that's</v>

388
00:22:21.241 --> 00:22:22.510
<v Speaker 1>just wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

389
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:25.650
<v Speaker 1>it tells you a lot about how your</v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous system is set up.</v>

390
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:30.660
<v Speaker 1>So you're focusing on counting the Baltz</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so for some reason getting the</v>

391
00:22:30.661 --> 00:22:34.250
<v Speaker 1>correct answer to the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many times are the,</v>

392
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:37.560
<v Speaker 1>is the ball thrown back and forth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out to be motivationally</v>

393
00:22:37.561 --> 00:22:38.910
<v Speaker 1>significant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

394
00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:41.420
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

395
00:22:41.421 --> 00:22:42.370
<v Speaker 1>Why did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

396
00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.030
<v Speaker 1>you've got the instructions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>

397
00:22:44.031 --> 00:22:49.031
<v Speaker 1>But why did you listen to them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh sure it does.</v>

398
00:22:50.151 --> 00:22:53.090
<v Speaker 1>But the question is why did you even</v>
<v Speaker 1>comply with the instructions?</v>

399
00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:58.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who said that?</v>

400
00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:00.640
<v Speaker 4>Because he wanted to get the answer</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

401
00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:03.400
<v Speaker 4>Why did you care if you got the answer</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

402
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:06.160
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>think about it for a minute.</v>

403
00:23:06.161 --> 00:23:09.870
<v Speaker 4>Like what gets me?</v>

404
00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:11.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

405
00:23:11.361 --> 00:23:13.760
<v Speaker 1>So that's one possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like instantly you sort of</v>

406
00:23:13.761 --> 00:23:17.810
<v Speaker 1>interpreted as a little cognitive task</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe and then you want to see if you</v>

407
00:23:17.811 --> 00:23:20.990
<v Speaker 1>can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that taps into your hierarchy of</v>

408
00:23:20.991 --> 00:23:23.450
<v Speaker 1>values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of your value is I want to be maybe</v>

409
00:23:23.451 --> 00:23:27.500
<v Speaker 1>a smart and competent person or I want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be at least as smart and competent as</v>

410
00:23:27.501 --> 00:23:30.310
<v Speaker 1>everyone else is playing this game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>

411
00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.980
<v Speaker 1>the instruction taps into a preexistent</v>
<v Speaker 1>value structure and then it's</v>

412
00:23:33.981 --> 00:23:34.880
<v Speaker 1>motivating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

413
00:23:34.881 --> 00:23:37.820
<v Speaker 1>So what compliance as well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

414
00:23:37.821 --> 00:23:41.750
<v Speaker 1>that's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the room in some ways is set</v>

415
00:23:41.751 --> 00:23:44.780
<v Speaker 1>up to ensure a degree of compliance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

416
00:23:44.781 --> 00:23:47.240
<v Speaker 1>Because an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an implicit story in the room</v>

417
00:23:47.241 --> 00:23:51.200
<v Speaker 1>which is if I'm at the front of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that sort of makes me at the top</v>

418
00:23:51.201 --> 00:23:54.440
<v Speaker 1>of the dominance hierarchy and the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're here means you've already</v>

419
00:23:54.441 --> 00:23:58.460
<v Speaker 1>bought into that presupposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a logical thing to do to</v>

420
00:23:58.461 --> 00:24:00.940
<v Speaker 1>play along with the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>

421
00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.920
<v Speaker 1>true that that's more like the playing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>game issue,</v>

422
00:24:08.921 --> 00:24:09.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that.</v>

423
00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe something interesting will happen.</v>

424
00:24:11.321 --> 00:24:12.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

425
00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:13.331
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

426
00:24:13.331 --> 00:24:15.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a variety of reasons why you</v>

427
00:24:15.131 --> 00:24:18.850
<v Speaker 1>might listen to the instructions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point is the instructions</v>

428
00:24:18.851 --> 00:24:23.170
<v Speaker 1>actually tap into your motivation in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your intrinsic motivation enough.</v>

429
00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:28.380
<v Speaker 1>So that you will in fact attempt to play</v>
<v Speaker 1>the game and then as soon as you play</v>

430
00:24:28.661 --> 00:24:32.320
<v Speaker 1>the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens while you focus your very</v>

431
00:24:32.321 --> 00:24:36.400
<v Speaker 1>limited attentional resources precisely</v>
<v Speaker 1>on what it is that you're supposed to</v>

432
00:24:36.401 --> 00:24:38.350
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we could talk a little bit about how</v>

433
00:24:38.351 --> 00:24:40.570
<v Speaker 1>the visual field is set up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

434
00:24:40.571 --> 00:24:43.780
<v Speaker 1>you notice that like if I'm looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the room,</v>

435
00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.420
<v Speaker 1>if I want to see you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of you,</v>

436
00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:50.290
<v Speaker 1>I can't just stand here and look</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight ahead because all you people</v>

437
00:24:50.291 --> 00:24:54.010
<v Speaker 1>over here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like I can't see if I'm looking</v>

438
00:24:54.011 --> 00:24:54.520
<v Speaker 1>straight ahead.</v>

439
00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:59.520
<v Speaker 1>I can't see the faces of anyone past</v>
<v Speaker 1>here and I can only see them sort of as</v>

440
00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:04.900
<v Speaker 1>blurs and unless they move and if they</v>
<v Speaker 1>move up something then I can see the</v>

441
00:25:04.901 --> 00:25:05.890
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I can't.</v>

442
00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:09.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not clear to me what's moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same for the people over</v>

443
00:25:09.341 --> 00:25:10.990
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only person I can really see right</v>

444
00:25:10.991 --> 00:25:14.680
<v Speaker 1>now is the woman who's sitting there in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the white sweater.</v>

445
00:25:14.681 --> 00:25:18.280
<v Speaker 1>All the rest of you are like the person</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the right.</v>

446
00:25:18.281 --> 00:25:20.230
<v Speaker 1>I can more or less as long as I look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

447
00:25:20.231 --> 00:25:23.530
<v Speaker 1>I could more or less see that he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>dressed in gray,</v>

448
00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.590
<v Speaker 1>but I can't see his face at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

449
00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:27.280
<v Speaker 1>He nodded his head and I can pick that</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

450
00:25:27.281 --> 00:25:31.630
<v Speaker 1>So what's very strange about your visual</v>
<v Speaker 1>system and your sensory systems are like</v>

451
00:25:31.631 --> 00:25:35.560
<v Speaker 1>this in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in you know all your sensory systems are</v>

452
00:25:35.561 --> 00:25:38.710
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you have a tiny little point of</v>

453
00:25:38.711 --> 00:25:43.711
<v Speaker 1>focus where the information is rich and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's partly because so the center of</v>

454
00:25:44.501 --> 00:25:47.170
<v Speaker 1>your eye is the full view and it's most</v>
<v Speaker 1>densely.</v>

455
00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:52.030
<v Speaker 1>It's most densely packed with cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly each of the cells</v>

456
00:25:52.031 --> 00:25:54.310
<v Speaker 1>in your phobia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the very center of your vision.</v>

457
00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:58.540
<v Speaker 1>You can tell when someone's pointing</v>
<v Speaker 1>their full view for via at you because</v>

458
00:25:58.541 --> 00:26:01.750
<v Speaker 1>then you have the sense that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at you and human beings are</v>

459
00:26:01.751 --> 00:26:06.751
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably good at figuring out when</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone is pointing their phobia at u of</v>

460
00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.170
<v Speaker 1>w we can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can detect I,</v>

461
00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:14.710
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deviation from direct gaze with an</v>

462
00:26:14.711 --> 00:26:18.520
<v Speaker 1>accuracy that's absolutely remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now each of those little cells in the</v>

463
00:26:18.521 --> 00:26:21.260
<v Speaker 1>phobia is connected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each of the one sells.</v>

464
00:26:21.261 --> 00:26:26.200
<v Speaker 1>It's connected to like 20,000 cells at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first level of the hierarchy of the</v>

465
00:26:26.201 --> 00:26:31.201
<v Speaker 1>visual system and so the reason that</v>
<v Speaker 1>your whole high isn't for vs [inaudible]</v>

466
00:26:31.491 --> 00:26:33.760
<v Speaker 1>your head would have to be this big to</v>
<v Speaker 1>manage it.</v>

467
00:26:33.761 --> 00:26:37.480
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's evolved is sort of a compromise</v>

468
00:26:37.481 --> 00:26:42.160
<v Speaker 1>is that in the center of your vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the center of your vision is very,</v>

469
00:26:42.161 --> 00:26:47.161
<v Speaker 1>very detailed and then what you do is</v>
<v Speaker 1>you zip that center around like snap,</v>

470
00:26:48.121 --> 00:26:48.631
<v Speaker 1>snap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snap,</v>

471
00:26:48.631 --> 00:26:49.231
<v Speaker 1>snap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snap,</v>

472
00:26:49.231 --> 00:26:52.620
<v Speaker 1>snap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your brain sorta makes a amalgamated</v>

473
00:26:52.621 --> 00:26:55.260
<v Speaker 1>picture out of all those little</v>
<v Speaker 1>snapshots and you know,</v>

474
00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.610
<v Speaker 1>then it weaves it together.</v>

475
00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:01.610
<v Speaker 1>So it seems to you like it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>continuous one continuous movie of</v>

476
00:27:01.621 --> 00:27:03.840
<v Speaker 1>consciousness even though it's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

477
00:27:03.841 --> 00:27:07.680
<v Speaker 1>And then the sides of your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the periphery of your eyes,</v>

478
00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:12.060
<v Speaker 1>well they don't have the same potency as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the full via and so they,</v>

479
00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:15.120
<v Speaker 1>they kind of play a triage game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

480
00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:17.550
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see if I'm looking straight</v>

481
00:27:17.551 --> 00:27:18.900
<v Speaker 1>ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see everything.</v>

482
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:24.210
<v Speaker 1>What might I use as an indication that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>should move my gaze from where I'm</v>

483
00:27:24.211 --> 00:27:27.120
<v Speaker 1>looking to somewhere else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one answer to that is movement.</v>

484
00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:31.260
<v Speaker 1>So the periphery is pretty good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>picking up movement and so often if you</v>

485
00:27:31.261 --> 00:27:34.620
<v Speaker 1>see movement in the periphery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'll move your full vision to</v>

486
00:27:34.621 --> 00:27:37.260
<v Speaker 1>where the movement was and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

487
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:40.200
<v Speaker 1>then you can keep track of what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>changing.</v>

488
00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:44.760
<v Speaker 1>So what your brain sort of assumes is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that when you're looking at something,</v>

489
00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:50.570
<v Speaker 1>everything else is irrelevant and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>also,</v>

490
00:27:50.611 --> 00:27:52.590
<v Speaker 1>it also sort of fades into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>

491
00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:54.960
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what's happening with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>gorilla video.</v>

492
00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:58.590
<v Speaker 1>And so the part of the reason you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>see the damn gorilla is because he's</v>

493
00:27:58.591 --> 00:28:02.100
<v Speaker 1>dressed in black like the players.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when you're focusing on the</v>

494
00:28:02.101 --> 00:28:06.240
<v Speaker 1>basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the block moving things look the</v>

495
00:28:06.241 --> 00:28:08.040
<v Speaker 1>same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

496
00:28:08.041 --> 00:28:09.840
<v Speaker 1>there's no distinction between them at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

497
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.810
<v Speaker 1>And then the background of the curtain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

498
00:28:12.811 --> 00:28:17.811
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you be primed to see the</v>

499
00:28:17.941 --> 00:28:21.420
<v Speaker 1>curtain changing color?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like things just don't do that in real</v>

500
00:28:21.421 --> 00:28:22.231
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

501
00:28:22.231 --> 00:28:25.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big objects don't suddenly change color</v>

502
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.400
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very seldomly.</v>

503
00:28:26.401 --> 00:28:27.800
<v Speaker 1>So and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

504
00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:31.590
<v Speaker 1>and more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the gorilla shows up,</v>

505
00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:36.870
<v Speaker 1>the fact that one player leaves and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that the curtains change color has</v>

506
00:28:36.871 --> 00:28:39.840
<v Speaker 1>no bearing whatsoever on whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can complete the task.</v>

507
00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.230
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't matter if you ignore the</v>

508
00:28:43.231 --> 00:28:48.231
<v Speaker 1>information and that's because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant in terms of the interpretive</v>

509
00:28:48.241 --> 00:28:50.220
<v Speaker 1>frame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the motivated interpretive frame that</v>

510
00:28:50.221 --> 00:28:51.510
<v Speaker 1>you're applying to the scene.</v>

511
00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:56.280
<v Speaker 1>And so the rule for perception is don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to anything that isn't</v>

512
00:28:56.281 --> 00:28:58.110
<v Speaker 1>directly relevant to the desired</v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome.</v>

513
00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:03.350
<v Speaker 1>Now exactly how you calculate what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can pay attention to and what you can't.</v>

514
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:05.730
<v Speaker 1>That's very complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

515
00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you build that knowledge bit by bit over</v>

516
00:29:08.971 --> 00:29:12.480
<v Speaker 1>time and you can be wrong about it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

517
00:29:12.481 --> 00:29:13.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

518
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.570
<v Speaker 1>so the old idea was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

519
00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:20.400
<v Speaker 1>well first of all that you were very</v>
<v Speaker 1>much conscious of the environment</v>

520
00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:21.840
<v Speaker 1>period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you're not.</v>

521
00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:25.290
<v Speaker 1>And then the second idea was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

522
00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.510
<v Speaker 1>while you're being conscious of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

523
00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:31.320
<v Speaker 1>if anything changes radically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will definitely focus your attention</v>

524
00:29:31.321 --> 00:29:33.540
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

525
00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.720
<v Speaker 1>and what turned out to be the case is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

526
00:29:36.721 --> 00:29:39.660
<v Speaker 1>you're not very conscious of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment and radical things can</v>

527
00:29:39.661 --> 00:29:43.000
<v Speaker 1>happen and you won't notice unless they</v>
<v Speaker 1>interfere with what you're doing.</v>

528
00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:47.560
<v Speaker 1>So something that emerges that</v>
<v Speaker 1>interferes with what you're doing that</v>

529
00:29:47.561 --> 00:29:50.290
<v Speaker 1>you don't expect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will instantly orient towards and</v>

530
00:29:50.291 --> 00:29:51.124
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on.</v>

531
00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:55.720
<v Speaker 1>So it isn't anomaly or novelty that</v>
<v Speaker 1>attracts your attention.</v>

532
00:29:55.990 --> 00:30:00.700
<v Speaker 1>It's the unexpected disruption of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between your behaviors and</v>

533
00:30:00.701 --> 00:30:04.630
<v Speaker 1>the desired outcome of those behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a much narrower claim.</v>

534
00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:07.660
<v Speaker 1>Only pay attention to things that make</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fail.</v>

535
00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:12.220
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least additionally,</v>

536
00:30:12.221 --> 00:30:14.170
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to things that make you</v>
<v Speaker 1>fail.</v>

537
00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.000
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>

538
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.300
<v Speaker 1>that's also associated with an emotional</v>
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>

539
00:30:19.301 --> 00:30:22.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're doing something and you</v>

540
00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:24.490
<v Speaker 1>think you know how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you're doing it and then all of a</v>

541
00:30:24.491 --> 00:30:27.520
<v Speaker 1>sudden something unexpected happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have an emotional</v>

542
00:30:27.521 --> 00:30:29.920
<v Speaker 1>reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'll talk more about the emotional</v>

543
00:30:29.921 --> 00:30:33.940
<v Speaker 1>reactions in the next class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the emotional reaction partly</v>

544
00:30:33.941 --> 00:30:37.780
<v Speaker 1>prepares you for the worst in case this</v>
<v Speaker 1>unexpected thing is bigger than you</v>

545
00:30:37.781 --> 00:30:40.030
<v Speaker 1>think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sort of also primes you to be</v>

546
00:30:40.031 --> 00:30:43.510
<v Speaker 1>curious and to start to explore to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what it is so that you can</v>

547
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:47.980
<v Speaker 1>reconstruct your expectations and</v>
<v Speaker 1>desires in accordance with the</v>

548
00:30:47.981 --> 00:30:50.380
<v Speaker 1>transforming world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

549
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:57.510
<v Speaker 1>this slide is an elaboration in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of what I was telling you a little</v>

550
00:30:57.511 --> 00:31:01.980
<v Speaker 1>bit earlier about the multiple levels of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality and also the idea is that the</v>

551
00:31:01.981 --> 00:31:04.560
<v Speaker 1>thing that you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in this particular schema would be</v>

552
00:31:04.561 --> 00:31:09.450
<v Speaker 1>the computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is nested inside all of these</v>

553
00:31:09.451 --> 00:31:12.510
<v Speaker 1>systems or has other systems nested</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of it.</v>

554
00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:15.210
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of an indication of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity of things.</v>

555
00:31:15.211 --> 00:31:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you might think</v>

556
00:31:18.481 --> 00:31:19.320
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

557
00:31:19.321 --> 00:31:20.700
<v Speaker 1>if you're using your computer,</v>

558
00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:27.120
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you might ask yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>is why is your computer a black</v>

559
00:31:27.121 --> 00:31:30.690
<v Speaker 1>rectangle or a like a silver rectangle?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all smooth and shiny.</v>

560
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:35.780
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

561
00:31:35.781 --> 00:31:38.660
<v Speaker 1>like it's not clear first it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>transparent.</v>

562
00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:41.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's got this smooth cover and</v>

563
00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:43.790
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't necessarily have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

564
00:31:43.791 --> 00:31:45.560
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think that's appealing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

565
00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's familiar.</v>

566
00:31:51.281 --> 00:31:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that that's good.</v>

567
00:31:53.021 --> 00:31:57.160
<v Speaker 1>So it's familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else is simple?</v>

568
00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:58.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to.</v>

569
00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:02.200
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to interact with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>computer at all.</v>

570
00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:05.740
<v Speaker 1>You wanted to attract with little</v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures on the screen and then you</v>

571
00:32:05.741 --> 00:32:07.540
<v Speaker 1>don't even really want to interact with</v>
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>

572
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:11.530
<v Speaker 1>You want to interact with some subset of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that picture is doing on the screen</v>

573
00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:14.980
<v Speaker 1>and so you're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rarely using the computer.</v>

574
00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:17.680
<v Speaker 1>You're just paying attention to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

575
00:32:17.681 --> 00:32:22.390
<v Speaker 1>let's say the screen and the keyboard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the computer is whatever's underneath</v>

576
00:32:22.391 --> 00:32:24.730
<v Speaker 1>that and then what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What that is is a collection of parts</v>

577
00:32:24.731 --> 00:32:27.460
<v Speaker 1>that are so bloody complicated that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to have anything to do with</v>

578
00:32:27.461 --> 00:32:31.450
<v Speaker 1>them that are nested inside a whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>network of things that are so complex.</v>

579
00:32:31.451 --> 00:32:32.830
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to have anything to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>

580
00:32:32.831 --> 00:32:35.320
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know what happens when you're</v>

581
00:32:35.321 --> 00:32:37.720
<v Speaker 1>using a computer is all of a sudden it</v>
<v Speaker 1>stops working.</v>

582
00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:41.360
<v Speaker 1>Well then it's a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as it stops working,</v>

583
00:32:41.361 --> 00:32:44.450
<v Speaker 1>it's a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before that it was whatever it was you</v>

584
00:32:44.451 --> 00:32:47.180
<v Speaker 1>were doing and as soon as it turns into</v>
<v Speaker 1>a computer,</v>

585
00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.560
<v Speaker 1>what do you do with it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

586
00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:53.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupidly hit the on and off button and</v>

587
00:32:53.091 --> 00:32:58.091
<v Speaker 1>maybe plug it in and out or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you checked your switches to</v>

588
00:32:58.881 --> 00:33:03.500
<v Speaker 1>make sure that a fuse didn't burn out or</v>
<v Speaker 1>a breaker go and that's pretty much the</v>

589
00:33:03.501 --> 00:33:08.030
<v Speaker 1>end of you in terms of your ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with the actual entity and then you</v>

590
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:13.190
<v Speaker 1>curse with your primate brain and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you send it out to be fixed.</v>

591
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:18.610
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that's that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>worth considering because this will also</v>

592
00:33:19.281 --> 00:33:23.360
<v Speaker 1>help us understand what happens in terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of brain function as we go along,</v>

593
00:33:23.361 --> 00:33:27.920
<v Speaker 1>is that as long as things are going</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to how you want them to go,</v>

594
00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.920
<v Speaker 1>you can really pretend that the world is</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably simple.</v>

595
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:34.970
<v Speaker 1>All the world consists of is those few</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you're doing in your little</v>

596
00:33:34.971 --> 00:33:39.740
<v Speaker 1>bounded perceptual frame and everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>else is zero.</v>

597
00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:45.350
<v Speaker 1>And then unfortunately now and then the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis that everything else is zero</v>

598
00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:49.850
<v Speaker 1>is radically wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when your computer crashes and then</v>

599
00:33:49.851 --> 00:33:53.690
<v Speaker 1>you have actually actually for awhile</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to deal with at least some of the</v>

600
00:33:53.691 --> 00:33:57.410
<v Speaker 1>complexity that's actually there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's usually extremely anxiety</v>

601
00:33:57.411 --> 00:33:59.080
<v Speaker 1>provoking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

602
00:33:59.081 --> 00:34:04.081
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine the same situation is</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're in your nice smooth car and</v>

603
00:34:04.251 --> 00:34:06.410
<v Speaker 1>you're on the highway and all of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden you know you hear a horrible</v>

604
00:34:06.411 --> 00:34:09.080
<v Speaker 1>grinding noise and smoke comes out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the back and you're,</v>

605
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:12.020
<v Speaker 1>you're off pulled over to the side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

606
00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:17.300
<v Speaker 1>what was merely a means of getting from</v>
<v Speaker 1>point a to B and comfort like two</v>

607
00:34:17.301 --> 00:34:21.200
<v Speaker 1>seconds ago is now a collection of</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely troublesome parts,</v>

608
00:34:21.410 --> 00:34:25.280
<v Speaker 1>none of which you know anything about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus it's disrupted your day.</v>

609
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:29.390
<v Speaker 1>Plus it's disrupted your pocket book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus you have to now deal with a bunch</v>

610
00:34:29.391 --> 00:34:32.510
<v Speaker 1>of people who are going to tell you</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with your vehicle and maybe</v>

611
00:34:32.511 --> 00:34:37.511
<v Speaker 1>fix it for some completely unknown</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of money and with dubious</v>

612
00:34:37.911 --> 00:34:39.620
<v Speaker 1>utility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so poof,</v>

613
00:34:39.621 --> 00:34:41.780
<v Speaker 1>the car turns into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>

614
00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:48.530
<v Speaker 1>it's almost impossible to overestimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>the degree to which we live within a</v>

615
00:34:48.531 --> 00:34:53.531
<v Speaker 1>world that's bounded by our expectations</v>
<v Speaker 1>and desires and how much time we spend</v>

616
00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:01.010
<v Speaker 1>keeping everything that's complex away</v>
<v Speaker 1>from us so that we don't have to deal</v>

617
00:35:01.011 --> 00:35:01.551
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

618
00:35:01.551 --> 00:35:04.370
<v Speaker 1>So now we might want to think about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do that.</v>

619
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:09.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to show you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the little Schema that might be</v>

620
00:35:09.201 --> 00:35:11.090
<v Speaker 1>helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like</v>

621
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:19.620
<v Speaker 1>I made this little diagram of dots</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I wanted to make an ambiguous</v>

622
00:35:19.621 --> 00:35:22.740
<v Speaker 1>figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm hoping that when you look at that</v>

623
00:35:22.741 --> 00:35:25.770
<v Speaker 1>figure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you see when you look at it?</v>

624
00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:37.270
<v Speaker 1>The center and what shape is the center?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cross.</v>

625
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can see</v>

626
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.450
<v Speaker 2>across.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else can you see?</v>

627
00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:42.650
<v Speaker 1>It's a rectangle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

628
00:35:42.651 --> 00:35:45.500
<v Speaker 1>What else can you see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's four squares.</v>

629
00:35:45.501 --> 00:35:46.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

630
00:35:46.191 --> 00:35:51.191
<v Speaker 1>So what else can you see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>

631
00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:58.860
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take your word for it though.</v>

632
00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:04.550
<v Speaker 1>What else can you see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you some of the things you can</v>

633
00:36:04.861 --> 00:36:05.694
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

634
00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:10.500
<v Speaker 1>You see that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that?</v>

635
00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:17.310
<v Speaker 1>See that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see that.</v>

636
00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:22.650
<v Speaker 1>You can see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

637
00:36:22.651 --> 00:36:25.920
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing that you might note</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that</v>

638
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:29.610
<v Speaker 1>the thing in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing in itself,</v>

639
00:36:29.611 --> 00:36:34.611
<v Speaker 1>let's say you can see multiple ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not exactly that.</v>

640
00:36:34.891 --> 00:36:37.770
<v Speaker 1>You have an opinion about what it is you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

641
00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:40.080
<v Speaker 1>it's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can actually see those different</v>

642
00:36:40.081 --> 00:36:43.320
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see it manifesting those</v>

643
00:36:43.321 --> 00:36:47.700
<v Speaker 1>different perceptual objects and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a strange thing because you know</v>

644
00:36:47.701 --> 00:36:51.090
<v Speaker 1>how people always think that arguments</v>
<v Speaker 1>are about opinions.</v>

645
00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:54.930
<v Speaker 1>There some facts and you have one set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions about them and you have</v>

646
00:36:54.931 --> 00:36:56.760
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you argue about the opinions</v>

647
00:36:56.761 --> 00:37:00.000
<v Speaker 1>until you get to the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately it's a lot worse than that</v>

648
00:37:00.001 --> 00:37:05.001
<v Speaker 1>because the facts themselves are often</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonably subject to debate.</v>

649
00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:09.090
<v Speaker 1>So you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might ask for example,</v>

650
00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:13.920
<v Speaker 1>which of the five ways that you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>see that initial thing is the right way</v>

651
00:37:13.921 --> 00:37:14.754
<v Speaker 1>to see it.</v>

652
00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:19.270
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a pragmatic answer,</v>

653
00:37:19.271 --> 00:37:21.580
<v Speaker 1>is it depends on what you want to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your perception.</v>

654
00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:23.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you want to,</v>

655
00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:29.860
<v Speaker 1>if you want the highest resolution that</v>
<v Speaker 1>captures as much detail as possible,</v>

656
00:37:29.861 --> 00:37:33.040
<v Speaker 1>then you want something as close to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing in itself as possible.</v>

657
00:37:33.041 --> 00:37:37.900
<v Speaker 1>So that probably be object five there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to know the rough area,</v>

658
00:37:37.901 --> 00:37:41.140
<v Speaker 1>let's say that's a map of an orchard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think about object one.</v>

659
00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:44.770
<v Speaker 1>If it's an orchard from the top right</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you wanted to walk from north to</v>

660
00:37:44.771 --> 00:37:46.780
<v Speaker 1>south,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might want to think about it in</v>

661
00:37:46.781 --> 00:37:50.560
<v Speaker 1>terms of object three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so those are different ways you can</v>

662
00:37:50.561 --> 00:37:54.760
<v Speaker 1>perceive that object and then I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>say that what happens at the next level</v>

663
00:37:54.761 --> 00:37:58.360
<v Speaker 1>of abstraction and that's where you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got the numbers and words down here is</v>

664
00:37:58.361 --> 00:38:02.320
<v Speaker 1>that you have the thing in itself which</v>
<v Speaker 1>is complex and can be seen in many ways.</v>

665
00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:07.000
<v Speaker 1>Then you have the things you see which</v>
<v Speaker 1>are partial sort of low resolution</v>

666
00:38:07.001 --> 00:38:12.001
<v Speaker 1>representations of the thing itself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there are words which are at least</v>

667
00:38:12.341 --> 00:38:15.340
<v Speaker 1>in part references to the image of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

668
00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:18.580
<v Speaker 1>And so by the time you get to the word</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty compressed.</v>

669
00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:21.760
<v Speaker 1>And I really liked the metaphor of</v>
<v Speaker 1>compression,</v>

670
00:38:21.761 --> 00:38:24.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so because a lot of the things you see</v>

671
00:38:24.161 --> 00:38:27.550
<v Speaker 1>are sort of like thumbnails and why our</v>
<v Speaker 1>thumbnails useful.</v>

672
00:38:27.551 --> 00:38:31.180
<v Speaker 1>You guys have done some image</v>
<v Speaker 1>processing.</v>

673
00:38:31.181 --> 00:38:36.181
<v Speaker 1>Say like obviously a thumbnail lacks</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that a 16 megabyte is that about</v>

674
00:38:38.351 --> 00:38:39.760
<v Speaker 1>right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How big are cameras?</v>

675
00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Sixteen megabytes for a single photo.</v>

676
00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:45.053
<v Speaker 4>What's that?</v>

677
00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:47.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

678
00:38:47.201 --> 00:38:49.480
<v Speaker 1>I think the new cameras are up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're up to 16.</v>

679
00:38:49.481 --> 00:38:50.500
<v Speaker 1>The newest iteration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

680
00:38:50.501 --> 00:38:53.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so why have thumbnail if you have a 16</v>

681
00:38:53.351 --> 00:38:54.580
<v Speaker 1>megabyte picture?</v>

682
00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.220
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why not use the picture?</v>

683
00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:03.410
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly it is that there's a</v>

684
00:39:03.411 --> 00:39:08.411
<v Speaker 1>tradeoff between detailed representation</v>
<v Speaker 1>and time utilization time and resource</v>

685
00:39:09.711 --> 00:39:12.260
<v Speaker 1>utilization and you know like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a computer,</v>

686
00:39:12.261 --> 00:39:16.100
<v Speaker 1>you guys have limited time and resources</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you don't actually want to see</v>

687
00:39:16.101 --> 00:39:19.910
<v Speaker 1>any more than you need to see in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get what you're supposed to get done</v>

688
00:39:19.911 --> 00:39:22.370
<v Speaker 1>done because otherwise it's just a waste</v>
<v Speaker 1>of energy.</v>

689
00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:25.850
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that your</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain is always trying to figure out in</v>

690
00:39:25.851 --> 00:39:30.851
<v Speaker 1>some sense what's the simplest way I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>represent this so that I can undertake</v>

691
00:39:31.071 --> 00:39:33.080
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is that I'm planning to</v>
<v Speaker 1>undertake next.</v>

692
00:39:33.081 --> 00:39:34.160
<v Speaker 1>And that sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

693
00:39:34.161 --> 00:39:37.040
<v Speaker 1>from a philosophical perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually something pragmatic.</v>

694
00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:38.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you might ask yourself,</v>

695
00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.880
<v Speaker 1>you organize your perceptions in</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to your goals and then you</v>

696
00:39:43.881 --> 00:39:44.691
<v Speaker 1>might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

697
00:39:44.691 --> 00:39:46.100
<v Speaker 1>where do those goals come from?</v>

698
00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:51.320
<v Speaker 1>And when we've heard from thinkers like</v>
<v Speaker 1>say Freud who talked about the IED</v>

699
00:39:51.321 --> 00:39:55.460
<v Speaker 1>functions in the Ed is sort of the seat</v>
<v Speaker 1>of primordial impulses.</v>

700
00:39:55.461 --> 00:39:57.090
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you might,</v>

701
00:39:57.091 --> 00:40:02.091
<v Speaker 1>you might think about the Ed as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>producer of primary goals or drives and</v>

702
00:40:02.541 --> 00:40:04.410
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think about them as drive,</v>

703
00:40:04.411 --> 00:40:06.770
<v Speaker 1>so they were things that led to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

704
00:40:06.771 --> 00:40:11.771
<v Speaker 1>a relatively rigid behavioral algorithm</v>
<v Speaker 1>once the state had arisen.</v>

705
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned before,</v>

706
00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:20.360
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's a flawed viewpoint</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the motivational state is more</v>

707
00:40:20.361 --> 00:40:24.710
<v Speaker 1>than merely a drive because the drive is</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that say triggers a</v>

708
00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:28.970
<v Speaker 1>preprogrammed sequence of behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of the early behaviorists</v>

709
00:40:28.971 --> 00:40:30.750
<v Speaker 1>thought about animal behavior in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

710
00:40:30.751 --> 00:40:32.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd say the animal encounter a</v>

711
00:40:32.211 --> 00:40:36.590
<v Speaker 1>stimulus and the stimulus would produce</v>
<v Speaker 1>a response and then the responses would</v>

712
00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:40.620
<v Speaker 1>get chained together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when the animal encounter the</v>

713
00:40:40.621 --> 00:40:43.400
<v Speaker 1>stimulus again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then just those change responses would</v>

714
00:40:43.401 --> 00:40:44.510
<v Speaker 1>automatically run.</v>

715
00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:49.420
<v Speaker 1>And one of the famous experiments that</v>
<v Speaker 1>showed that that was wrong was a rad,</v>

716
00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:52.280
<v Speaker 1>was trained to run through a maze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can sort of train your out pretty</v>

717
00:40:52.281 --> 00:40:55.400
<v Speaker 1>quickly if you know you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put them in the maze and there's</v>

718
00:40:55.401 --> 00:40:58.730
<v Speaker 1>like he can go this way or this way and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put some cheese over here,</v>

719
00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:01.460
<v Speaker 1>you do that three or four times the rat</v>
<v Speaker 1>learns to turn right.</v>

720
00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:03.890
<v Speaker 1>And then you add another piece to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>maze and you know,</v>

721
00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:07.070
<v Speaker 1>then the rat learns to turn left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can get it turning,</v>

722
00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:09.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely in an extremely complicated</v>

723
00:41:09.531 --> 00:41:13.430
<v Speaker 1>way to walk through the maze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then what they did was they took a</v>

724
00:41:13.431 --> 00:41:16.580
<v Speaker 1>rat and they wrapped up its hind legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

725
00:41:16.581 --> 00:41:18.800
<v Speaker 1>like with tape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it couldn't use them.</v>

726
00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:23.360
<v Speaker 1>And then they put little rear end on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cart and then they had the little rat</v>

727
00:41:23.361 --> 00:41:25.520
<v Speaker 1>scoot through the maze on the cart.</v>

728
00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:29.030
<v Speaker 1>And it's obvious that a scooting route</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a running route don't use the same</v>

729
00:41:29.031 --> 00:41:30.770
<v Speaker 1>motor output,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even close.</v>

730
00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:32.600
<v Speaker 1>And the rat could still get through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>maze.</v>

731
00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:35.960
<v Speaker 1>So idea that all the rat had done was</v>
<v Speaker 1>chained together,</v>

732
00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:40.010
<v Speaker 1>learned automatic responses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turned out to be wrong.</v>

733
00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:42.290
<v Speaker 1>Rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more like rats,</v>

734
00:41:42.291 --> 00:41:45.740
<v Speaker 1>learn what's going on and can generalize</v>
<v Speaker 1>from it just like you do so.</v>

735
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:47.181
<v Speaker 1>So anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

736
00:41:47.181 --> 00:41:52.181
<v Speaker 1>so the notion that the drive just</v>
<v Speaker 1>instantiates a sequence of preprogram</v>

737
00:41:52.401 --> 00:41:55.430
<v Speaker 1>behaviors in most cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in many cases,</v>

738
00:41:55.431 --> 00:41:58.220
<v Speaker 1>especially with complex behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out to be wrong.</v>

739
00:41:58.221 --> 00:42:00.770
<v Speaker 1>There are some limited circumstances</v>
<v Speaker 1>under which it's right.</v>

740
00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:04.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the first hypothesis we're going to</v>

741
00:42:04.971 --> 00:42:09.110
<v Speaker 1>entertain is the idea that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>frame the world in order to interact</v>

742
00:42:09.111 --> 00:42:10.020
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is sort of a little</v>

743
00:42:10.021 --> 00:42:13.040
<v Speaker 1>mythological diagram that I whipped up a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time ago,</v>

744
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:16.220
<v Speaker 1>and the bottom thing that's a neuro bros</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

745
00:42:16.221 --> 00:42:18.110
<v Speaker 1>which is a dragon that eats its own</v>
<v Speaker 1>tail.</v>

746
00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:23.000
<v Speaker 1>It's an ancient symbol of chaos and</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos is what you see when you don't</v>

747
00:42:23.001 --> 00:42:25.310
<v Speaker 1>know what you're looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say,</v>

748
00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:28.580
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos is all the complexity that</v>

749
00:42:28.581 --> 00:42:29.630
<v Speaker 1>surrounds you,</v>

750
00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:31.453
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

751
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:35.320
<v Speaker 1>could possibly intrude on your little</v>
<v Speaker 1>safe world.</v>

752
00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:36.793
<v Speaker 2>And then</v>

753
00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:40.260
<v Speaker 1>to grasp that chaos also to operate</v>
<v Speaker 1>within it,</v>

754
00:42:40.261 --> 00:42:44.010
<v Speaker 1>you have to put it within a framework</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's the great father there.</v>

755
00:42:44.011 --> 00:42:48.120
<v Speaker 1>That's actually God you see God's got</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sun behind him because God is the</v>

756
00:42:48.121 --> 00:42:51.840
<v Speaker 1>son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's reliable and he's associated with</v>

757
00:42:51.841 --> 00:42:54.720
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and then he sort of ruling</v>
<v Speaker 1>over this city.</v>

758
00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:59.010
<v Speaker 1>And so for me that was a good symbol of</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and put it in part culture is</v>

759
00:42:59.011 --> 00:43:02.250
<v Speaker 1>what's outside of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in part culture is also the</v>

760
00:43:02.251 --> 00:43:05.820
<v Speaker 1>frameworks that you've learned to use by</v>
<v Speaker 1>being with other people,</v>

761
00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:09.840
<v Speaker 1>the frameworks that you've learned to</v>
<v Speaker 1>use to narrow and specify the world.</v>

762
00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:15.220
<v Speaker 1>And in my motive thinking that framing</v>
<v Speaker 1>is associated with security on the one</v>

763
00:43:16.711 --> 00:43:19.340
<v Speaker 1>hand because it tells you what you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>do and you know,</v>

764
00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:23.100
<v Speaker 1>makes things safe for you and tyranny on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other hand because it can get out of</v>

765
00:43:23.101 --> 00:43:25.440
<v Speaker 1>control and you can start to get too</v>
<v Speaker 1>rigid.</v>

766
00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:29.220
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Regardless of the pros and cons of</v>

767
00:43:29.221 --> 00:43:30.054
<v Speaker 1>framing.</v>

768
00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:34.540
<v Speaker 1>If you see something one way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can't see it another,</v>

769
00:43:34.541 --> 00:43:37.900
<v Speaker 1>it's harder to see it another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the con side of framing the</v>

770
00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:41.170
<v Speaker 1>pro side of framing is while it then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to do something.</v>

771
00:43:41.171 --> 00:43:44.260
<v Speaker 1>If it's unframed you're in chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's existential anxiety,</v>

772
00:43:44.261 --> 00:43:46.780
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to move ahead at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to frame things,</v>

773
00:43:46.781 --> 00:43:50.230
<v Speaker 1>you have to simplify them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And really in some sense you even have</v>

774
00:43:50.231 --> 00:43:54.040
<v Speaker 1>to oversimplify them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on what you mean by that.</v>

775
00:43:54.041 --> 00:43:57.600
<v Speaker 1>But what you're really trying to do is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to never make your perceptual task any</v>

776
00:43:57.601 --> 00:44:01.210
<v Speaker 1>more complex and it has to be in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get done what you need to get done.</v>

777
00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:04.870
<v Speaker 1>So how do you frame things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

778
00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:08.260
<v Speaker 1>the first thing we should point out is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of framing doesn't even</v>

779
00:44:08.261 --> 00:44:11.200
<v Speaker 1>happen psychologically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

780
00:44:11.201 --> 00:44:15.820
<v Speaker 1>So here you are sitting in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>classroom and you're not overwhelmed by</v>

781
00:44:15.821 --> 00:44:16.630
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

782
00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:17.463
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

783
00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:19.271
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

784
00:44:19.271 --> 00:44:22.690
<v Speaker 1>you're in a city that's helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's electricity here and there's</v>

785
00:44:22.691 --> 00:44:25.330
<v Speaker 1>natural gas and there's people to fix</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the plumbing.</v>

786
00:44:25.331 --> 00:44:28.780
<v Speaker 1>And so the fact that you're in a city</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes life much simpler.</v>

787
00:44:28.781 --> 00:44:31.110
<v Speaker 1>Right off the bat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no nothing trying to eat you.</v>

788
00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:34.740
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to contend with the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's like minus 20 for three months</v>

789
00:44:34.741 --> 00:44:36.960
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's a whole bunch of complexity</v>

790
00:44:36.961 --> 00:44:41.961
<v Speaker 1>that the were the civilized world has</v>
<v Speaker 1>just taken care of for you and then now</v>

791
00:44:43.501 --> 00:44:46.650
<v Speaker 1>you're in the university in the city and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that eliminates a whole bunch of other</v>

792
00:44:46.651 --> 00:44:47.484
<v Speaker 1>hassles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

793
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:50.730
<v Speaker 1>there's some things you have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a bunch of things you don't</v>

794
00:44:50.731 --> 00:44:53.490
<v Speaker 1>have to do and then you're inside this</v>
<v Speaker 1>building and wow,</v>

795
00:44:53.491 --> 00:44:55.350
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's electric light here and you</v>

796
00:44:55.351 --> 00:44:55.690
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

797
00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:59.310
<v Speaker 1>and the chairs work and there's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be an earthquake and probably</v>

798
00:44:59.311 --> 00:45:00.900
<v Speaker 1>the whole building isn't going to fall</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

799
00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:03.570
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time you're sitting in your chair</v>

800
00:45:03.571 --> 00:45:08.040
<v Speaker 1>here also with your clothing on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you screened a lot of complexity out</v>

801
00:45:08.041 --> 00:45:10.230
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can sit there fairly calmly.</v>

802
00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:12.600
<v Speaker 1>And so that's all external.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

803
00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:15.120
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where thinking about,</v>

804
00:45:15.121 --> 00:45:18.600
<v Speaker 1>because this isn't only psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll guys will hear a fair bit about</v>

805
00:45:18.601 --> 00:45:21.960
<v Speaker 1>terror management theories as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress through your education.</v>

806
00:45:21.961 --> 00:45:26.961
<v Speaker 1>And so Karen Management theories are</v>
<v Speaker 1>theories that attempt to account for why</v>

807
00:45:27.091 --> 00:45:31.230
<v Speaker 1>people are say patriotic in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs,</v>

808
00:45:31.231 --> 00:45:35.430
<v Speaker 1>why they adopt belief systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the idea is that a belief system</v>

809
00:45:35.431 --> 00:45:39.480
<v Speaker 1>protects you from death anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so Freud's Sorta said that about</v>

810
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:41.700
<v Speaker 1>religious systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was his critique of religion.</v>

811
00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:46.020
<v Speaker 1>People are afraid of death and so they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have this infant title desire to have</v>

812
00:45:46.021 --> 00:45:48.390
<v Speaker 1>that fear go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they turned to religion and religion</v>

813
00:45:48.391 --> 00:45:48.841
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

814
00:45:48.841 --> 00:45:51.180
<v Speaker 1>death isn't permanent and that's why</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are religious.</v>

815
00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:53.970
<v Speaker 1>And the extension of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

816
00:45:53.971 --> 00:45:56.280
<v Speaker 1>that's also why they have belief systems</v>
<v Speaker 1>in general.</v>

817
00:45:56.310 --> 00:46:00.090
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to protect themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>against this deep shaking anxiety.</v>

818
00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:02.550
<v Speaker 1>And to some degree I suspect that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>

819
00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:07.440
<v Speaker 1>but you should also remember that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're protecting your culture,</v>

820
00:46:07.441 --> 00:46:10.470
<v Speaker 1>say if you identify with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're patriotic or whatever it is,</v>

821
00:46:10.471 --> 00:46:12.390
<v Speaker 1>or you think that your culture is worth</v>
<v Speaker 1>defending.</v>

822
00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:15.090
<v Speaker 1>You're not just defending something</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological.</v>

823
00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:18.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like the culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the function,</v>

824
00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:21.300
<v Speaker 1>the functioning culture keeps the lights</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

825
00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:23.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it doesn't just protect you from</v>

826
00:46:23.701 --> 00:46:27.000
<v Speaker 1>death anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also protects you from death.</v>

827
00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:30.210
<v Speaker 1>And that's even more important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time than being protected</v>

828
00:46:30.211 --> 00:46:31.110
<v Speaker 1>from death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>

829
00:46:31.111 --> 00:46:33.180
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a psychological component to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it too,</v>

830
00:46:33.181 --> 00:46:37.800
<v Speaker 1>but you don't ever want to underestimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the practical utility of being</v>

831
00:46:37.801 --> 00:46:39.170
<v Speaker 1>nested inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

832
00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:42.150
<v Speaker 1>what Piaget would consider a relatively</v>
<v Speaker 1>functional game.</v>

833
00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:44.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like your world is a lot simpler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

834
00:46:44.731 --> 00:46:47.580
<v Speaker 1>you have to work to maintain it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and that's kind of a drag.</v>

835
00:46:47.581 --> 00:46:49.560
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's the tyrannical element of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

836
00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:51.420
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the payoff's pretty big.</v>

837
00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at medieval cities,</v>

838
00:46:53.941 --> 00:46:56.970
<v Speaker 1>this is a well preserved medieval city</v>
<v Speaker 1>in France.</v>

839
00:46:56.971 --> 00:47:00.330
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of medieval cities that</v>
<v Speaker 1>still exist in Europe and you see this</v>

840
00:47:00.331 --> 00:47:05.310
<v Speaker 1>is a typical sort of human habitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like inside there's order and</v>

841
00:47:05.311 --> 00:47:09.090
<v Speaker 1>outside there's chaos and barbarians and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's a couple of walls to keep</v>

842
00:47:09.091 --> 00:47:12.030
<v Speaker 1>the chaos and the barbarians out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then inside,</v>

843
00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:15.780
<v Speaker 1>you know there's a dominance hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody can live their relatively</v>

844
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:19.350
<v Speaker 1>productive and relatively peaceful lives</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of that.</v>

845
00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:23.100
<v Speaker 1>So all framing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting rid of complexity,</v>

846
00:47:23.101 --> 00:47:27.270
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing with houses.</v>

847
00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:30.310
<v Speaker 1>They do the same thing for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then social</v>

848
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:32.380
<v Speaker 5>institutions do the same thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

849
00:47:32.381 --> 00:47:33.900
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a,</v>

850
00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.660
<v Speaker 5>is it Kennedy there and an Obama?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think so.</v>

851
00:47:37.661 --> 00:47:42.220
<v Speaker 5>This is part of the transition in power</v>
<v Speaker 5>from George Bush to Obama and you know,</v>

852
00:47:42.221 --> 00:47:45.730
<v Speaker 5>that's a pretty scary thing to have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're the leader of your dominance</v>

853
00:47:45.731 --> 00:47:48.790
<v Speaker 5>hierarchy replaced by another leader and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

854
00:47:48.791 --> 00:47:53.410
<v Speaker 5>among chimpanzees for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's often the occasion for a fair bit</v>

855
00:47:53.411 --> 00:47:57.880
<v Speaker 5>of mayhem and it's also the case often</v>
<v Speaker 5>for people that that's,</v>

856
00:47:58.090 --> 00:48:00.220
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that that occurs and you know,</v>

857
00:48:00.221 --> 00:48:02.950
<v Speaker 5>we still have that in the form of</v>
<v Speaker 5>political corruption and so on.</v>

858
00:48:02.951 --> 00:48:04.930
<v Speaker 5>But all things considered,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

859
00:48:04.931 --> 00:48:09.931
<v Speaker 5>the power of transition from Obama or</v>
<v Speaker 5>from Bush to Obama was far more peaceful</v>

860
00:48:10.391 --> 00:48:13.150
<v Speaker 5>than such.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Power transitions generally are if you</v>

861
00:48:13.151 --> 00:48:17.590
<v Speaker 5>look across the history of mankind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so that means you're also protected</v>

862
00:48:17.591 --> 00:48:21.010
<v Speaker 5>by your social institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They screen out a lot of potential</v>

863
00:48:21.011 --> 00:48:24.430
<v Speaker 5>complexity as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as long as they're functional.</v>

864
00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:26.770
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and also I think as long as they follow</v>

865
00:48:26.771 --> 00:48:30.870
<v Speaker 5>some of the pig and rules.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so one of the Phd and rules for a,</v>

866
00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:33.370
<v Speaker 5>for a playable game is there's some</v>
<v Speaker 5>reciprocity.</v>

867
00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:37.060
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you regard the system roughly speaking</v>

868
00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:42.210
<v Speaker 5>as either fair or fairer than any other</v>
<v Speaker 5>system you can think up.</v>

869
00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:45.430
<v Speaker 5>You know what it boils down to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same thing because if it's not fair,</v>

870
00:48:45.431 --> 00:48:47.230
<v Speaker 5>but you can't come up with a better</v>
<v Speaker 5>fantasy.</v>

871
00:48:47.231 --> 00:48:49.570
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's as good as it can be.</v>

872
00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:52.120
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the,</v>

873
00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:56.200
<v Speaker 5>the sociological or sociopolitical</v>
<v Speaker 5>structures that keep complexity away</v>

874
00:48:56.201 --> 00:49:00.160
<v Speaker 5>from us can only operate under a certain</v>
<v Speaker 5>limited number of constraints.</v>

875
00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.910
<v Speaker 5>But still they perform their function,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

876
00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:04.510
<v Speaker 5>and very admirably.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

877
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:07.450
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think because I see people in my</v>

878
00:49:07.451 --> 00:49:09.100
<v Speaker 5>clinical practice all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

879
00:49:09.101 --> 00:49:12.880
<v Speaker 5>and most people that I see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think this is true of most people</v>

880
00:49:12.881 --> 00:49:17.080
<v Speaker 5>in the world have at least one serious</v>
<v Speaker 5>problem,</v>

881
00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:19.420
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it might be they have an illness</v>

882
00:49:19.421 --> 00:49:20.740
<v Speaker 5>that's just god awful.</v>

883
00:49:21.110 --> 00:49:25.090
<v Speaker 5>Or if or if they don't have any illness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of their immediate family has an</v>

884
00:49:25.091 --> 00:49:26.680
<v Speaker 5>illness that's god awful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or they're,</v>

885
00:49:26.681 --> 00:49:27.940
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're really old and they're,</v>

886
00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:31.690
<v Speaker 5>and they need to be taken care of or</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're suffering from some insane</v>

887
00:49:31.691 --> 00:49:35.110
<v Speaker 5>economic problem or they've just been</v>
<v Speaker 5>unemployed or whatever.</v>

888
00:49:35.111 --> 00:49:35.581
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

889
00:49:35.581 --> 00:49:38.890
<v Speaker 5>there's something in their immediate</v>
<v Speaker 5>circle that's really,</v>

890
00:49:38.891 --> 00:49:42.880
<v Speaker 5>really difficult to grapple with and yet</v>
<v Speaker 5>people still go out and maintain their</v>

891
00:49:42.881 --> 00:49:47.440
<v Speaker 5>place in the world and the whole thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>roughly works and to me that's just a</v>

892
00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:51.400
<v Speaker 5>continual source of amazement that</v>
<v Speaker 5>people can pull that off,</v>

893
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:53.800
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so anyway,</v>

894
00:49:53.801 --> 00:49:58.090
<v Speaker 5>so a lot of the screening that you do to</v>
<v Speaker 5>get rid of that complexity is external</v>

895
00:49:58.210 --> 00:50:00.550
<v Speaker 5>and part of that is a consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 5>good,</v>

896
00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:04.420
<v Speaker 5>well functioning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sociological organization.</v>

897
00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:10.120
<v Speaker 5>Then the next thing that sort of screens</v>
<v Speaker 5>things out for you as your body right</v>

898
00:50:10.121 --> 00:50:10.954
<v Speaker 5>now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

899
00:50:11.410 --> 00:50:14.560
<v Speaker 5>you kind of naturally see things at a</v>
<v Speaker 5>particular level of resolution,</v>

900
00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:15.430
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

901
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:18.070
<v Speaker 5>There's no obvious reason why that</v>
<v Speaker 5>should be.</v>

902
00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:19.540
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

903
00:50:20.110 --> 00:50:22.510
<v Speaker 5>you see the front of people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't see the back of them.</v>

904
00:50:22.511 --> 00:50:25.900
<v Speaker 5>You see their external covering their</v>
<v Speaker 5>skin and their clothes.</v>

905
00:50:25.901 --> 00:50:28.430
<v Speaker 5>You can't see inside them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you look closely at them,</v>

906
00:50:28.431 --> 00:50:31.360
<v Speaker 5>you can't see their cellular structure</v>
<v Speaker 5>or their molecular structure,</v>

907
00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:35.060
<v Speaker 5>their atomic structure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't really see the social</v>

908
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:38.600
<v Speaker 5>situations that they're embedded in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if I look at you,</v>

909
00:50:38.601 --> 00:50:40.270
<v Speaker 5>I can't see your family.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

910
00:50:40.290 --> 00:50:41.840
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I presume you have one.</v>

911
00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:46.130
<v Speaker 5>I can't really see the political</v>
<v Speaker 5>situation that surrounds you either.</v>

912
00:50:46.131 --> 00:50:49.850
<v Speaker 5>I have to know that abstractly and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ecological level is almost</v>

913
00:50:49.851 --> 00:50:54.851
<v Speaker 5>completely imperceptible to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so part of the way that complexity</v>

914
00:50:54.921 --> 00:50:58.610
<v Speaker 5>is screened out is that your body just</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't allow you to pick a lot of it</v>

915
00:50:58.611 --> 00:51:00.500
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're just blind to it.</v>

916
00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:05.740
<v Speaker 5>So you see at one level of resolution</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's the human level.</v>

917
00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:08.510
<v Speaker 5>You see things of approximately our</v>
<v Speaker 5>size,</v>

918
00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:11.690
<v Speaker 5>you see things that are approximately</v>
<v Speaker 5>the size that we can grip.</v>

919
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:15.380
<v Speaker 5>Those are sort of the things that you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>likely to come to think of as objects.</v>

920
00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:18.260
<v Speaker 5>Like clearly a mountain isn't exactly an</v>
<v Speaker 5>object,</v>

921
00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:23.030
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so usability is part of what defines</v>

922
00:51:23.031 --> 00:51:26.030
<v Speaker 5>perceptibility and so that also screens</v>
<v Speaker 5>things out</v>

923
00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:32.800
<v Speaker 5>and so then you're left with while what</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is that you have to deal with once</v>

924
00:51:34.281 --> 00:51:36.200
<v Speaker 5>everything's been screened out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you might ask,</v>

925
00:51:36.201 --> 00:51:39.170
<v Speaker 5>well there's still a lot of complexity</v>
<v Speaker 5>left there.</v>

926
00:51:39.171 --> 00:51:41.240
<v Speaker 5>Like they say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's plenty of complexity within the</v>

927
00:51:41.241 --> 00:51:45.770
<v Speaker 5>average family and there's plenty of</v>
<v Speaker 5>complexity in the mating domain,</v>

928
00:51:45.771 --> 00:51:47.990
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to find a partner and to establish a</v>

929
00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:51.350
<v Speaker 5>reasonable longterm relationship and to</v>
<v Speaker 5>have children and to raise them.</v>

930
00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:56.530
<v Speaker 5>There's plenty of complexity left.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the question is how did</v>

931
00:51:57.170 --> 00:52:00.200
<v Speaker 5>biology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how did biology come to solve those</v>

932
00:52:00.201 --> 00:52:01.034
<v Speaker 5>problems?</v>

933
00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:03.410
<v Speaker 5>Given that there are almost infinite</v>
<v Speaker 5>complexity,</v>

934
00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:06.710
<v Speaker 5>how can you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the answer to that is fundamentally</v>

935
00:52:06.711 --> 00:52:09.500
<v Speaker 5>a Darwinian answer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You start simple.</v>

936
00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:12.350
<v Speaker 5>So that's back in the days of the one</v>
<v Speaker 5>celled organisms.</v>

937
00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:14.780
<v Speaker 5>We have no idea how those things got</v>
<v Speaker 5>their start,</v>

938
00:52:14.810 --> 00:52:17.870
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the actual beginning of life is a</v>

939
00:52:17.871 --> 00:52:20.150
<v Speaker 5>serious mystery and Ocala,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

940
00:52:20.151 --> 00:52:23.120
<v Speaker 5>It's such a serious mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is completely unbelievable,</v>

941
00:52:23.121 --> 00:52:25.520
<v Speaker 5>but one of the people who discovered</v>
<v Speaker 5>DNA,</v>

942
00:52:25.521 --> 00:52:27.410
<v Speaker 5>I think it was Francis Crick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in fact,</v>

943
00:52:27.411 --> 00:52:31.160
<v Speaker 5>I'm virtually certain it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He actually believed that DNA came from</v>

944
00:52:31.161 --> 00:52:33.980
<v Speaker 5>an alien civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wrote a whole book about that.</v>

945
00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:37.760
<v Speaker 5>It's called Panspermia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so he believes that believed</v>

946
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.710
<v Speaker 5>posited,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it's possible for DNA to drift</v>

947
00:52:42.711 --> 00:52:47.711
<v Speaker 5>through space for millions of years and</v>
<v Speaker 5>to land on planets and to start living</v>

948
00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:52.910
<v Speaker 5>and God only knows how old dna is</v>
<v Speaker 5>because he just couldn't figure out at</v>

949
00:52:52.911 --> 00:52:54.620
<v Speaker 5>all how it could have possibly evolved.</v>

950
00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:59.900
<v Speaker 5>So scientists are a lot weirder than you</v>
<v Speaker 5>think when you start to read about what</v>

951
00:52:59.901 --> 00:53:03.710
<v Speaker 5>the scientists who discovered things</v>
<v Speaker 5>really thought they're completely out of</v>

952
00:53:03.711 --> 00:53:06.710
<v Speaker 5>their mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but whatever.</v>

953
00:53:06.711 --> 00:53:11.030
<v Speaker 5>We'll assume that DNA got there somehow</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then evolution took over after that.</v>

954
00:53:11.031 --> 00:53:13.310
<v Speaker 5>And so what does evolution do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It basically says,</v>

955
00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:16.760
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here is a terribly complex problem that</v>

956
00:53:16.761 --> 00:53:21.500
<v Speaker 5>we've sort of partially solved and</v>
<v Speaker 5>partially solved means we've lived long</v>

957
00:53:21.501 --> 00:53:25.100
<v Speaker 5>enough to produce another copy of</v>
<v Speaker 5>ourself that constitutes the solution.</v>

958
00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:30.140
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we've lived long enough so that we</v>

959
00:53:30.391 --> 00:53:33.240
<v Speaker 5>could conceivably duplicate ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How should we do that?</v>

960
00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:35.070
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a variety of different ways.</v>

961
00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:37.250
<v Speaker 5>That's the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We should produce variants,</v>

962
00:53:37.251 --> 00:53:41.190
<v Speaker 5>so that might be multiple offspring or</v>
<v Speaker 5>it might be.</v>

963
00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:45.900
<v Speaker 5>It might also be facilitated by random</v>
<v Speaker 5>mutation.</v>

964
00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:48.060
<v Speaker 5>Hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that mutations are random,</v>

965
00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:53.360
<v Speaker 5>although there's increasing evidence by</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way that organisms are much more</v>

966
00:53:53.971 --> 00:53:58.380
<v Speaker 5>complex at the genetic level than anyone</v>
<v Speaker 5>ever assumed and bacteria,</v>

967
00:53:58.381 --> 00:54:00.750
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>swap DNA back and forth with other</v>

968
00:54:00.751 --> 00:54:05.520
<v Speaker 5>bacteria all the time and there are</v>
<v Speaker 5>experiences that you can have that will</v>

969
00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:09.210
<v Speaker 5>change your genetic structure</v>
<v Speaker 5>sufficiently so that you will transmit</v>

970
00:54:09.211 --> 00:54:10.140
<v Speaker 5>that to your children.</v>

971
00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:14.850
<v Speaker 5>So you know the idea that everything's</v>
<v Speaker 5>purely Darwinian and it's only mutation</v>

972
00:54:14.851 --> 00:54:19.680
<v Speaker 5>that drives randomness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's clearly likely,</v>

973
00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:23.550
<v Speaker 5>but not not complete.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These other mechanisms are clearly</v>

974
00:54:23.551 --> 00:54:24.580
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the.</v>

975
00:54:24.610 --> 00:54:26.710
<v Speaker 5>The.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The issue is is that what you do is you.</v>

976
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:30.210
<v Speaker 5>You start with something that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>works and then you produce micro</v>

977
00:54:30.211 --> 00:54:34.530
<v Speaker 5>variants of it and then that world</v>
<v Speaker 5>around you changes a little bit and</v>

978
00:54:34.531 --> 00:54:38.460
<v Speaker 5>hopefully one of those micro variants</v>
<v Speaker 5>manages to do the same thing and then it</v>

979
00:54:38.461 --> 00:54:42.720
<v Speaker 5>produces a bunch of micro variance and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then they managed to do the same thing.</v>

980
00:54:42.721 --> 00:54:46.530
<v Speaker 5>And so what's happening is there's an</v>
<v Speaker 5>arms race between the environment which</v>

981
00:54:46.531 --> 00:54:50.310
<v Speaker 5>is always changing and the organisms</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are trying to keep up with it and</v>

982
00:54:50.311 --> 00:54:52.980
<v Speaker 5>that arms race just goes on forever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

983
00:54:52.981 --> 00:54:56.670
<v Speaker 5>different lifeforms proliferate as that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as that occurs,</v>

984
00:54:56.790 --> 00:55:01.380
<v Speaker 5>it's sort of like life is always playing</v>
<v Speaker 5>catch up and you never get it right.</v>

985
00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:04.380
<v Speaker 5>You cannot get it right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The best you can do is get it right long</v>

986
00:55:04.381 --> 00:55:09.381
<v Speaker 5>enough to live long enough to reproduce.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That constitutes the sum total of your</v>

987
00:55:11.371 --> 00:55:15.030
<v Speaker 5>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So and so what that means,</v>

988
00:55:15.031 --> 00:55:16.980
<v Speaker 5>at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that you guys are all the</v>

989
00:55:17.010 --> 00:55:18.390
<v Speaker 5>beneficiary,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>

990
00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:23.040
<v Speaker 5>of a evolutionary process that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>basically been going on since the</v>

991
00:55:23.041 --> 00:55:25.620
<v Speaker 5>beginning of life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's about three point 5 billion</v>

992
00:55:25.621 --> 00:55:27.240
<v Speaker 5>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so your body,</v>

993
00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:32.340
<v Speaker 5>your psychophysiology has been in an</v>
<v Speaker 5>arms race with the transforming</v>

994
00:55:32.341 --> 00:55:36.630
<v Speaker 5>environment for three and a half billion</v>
<v Speaker 5>years trying to keep up and poof,</v>

995
00:55:36.631 --> 00:55:41.631
<v Speaker 5>you're the stellar consequence of three</v>
<v Speaker 5>and a half billion years of like effort</v>

996
00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:44.700
<v Speaker 5>and death.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

997
00:55:44.730 --> 00:55:47.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you might think the cosmos about that.</v>

998
00:55:47.491 --> 00:55:50.730
<v Speaker 5>You think about this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every single one of your female</v>

999
00:55:50.731 --> 00:55:55.560
<v Speaker 5>ancestors successfully reproduced like</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's mind boggling.</v>

1000
00:55:55.590 --> 00:55:58.500
<v Speaker 5>It's mind boggling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're so unlikely that you would be</v>

1001
00:55:58.501 --> 00:55:59.334
<v Speaker 5>here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1002
00:55:59.370 --> 00:56:01.620
<v Speaker 5>that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it's almost incalculable.</v>

1003
00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:05.100
<v Speaker 5>So good for us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here we are.</v>

1004
00:56:05.101 --> 00:56:06.720
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how successful can you get?</v>

1005
00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:10.050
<v Speaker 5>So my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my point is that part of the way that</v>

1006
00:56:10.051 --> 00:56:12.510
<v Speaker 5>complexity is dealt with is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is haphazard.</v>

1007
00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:16.020
<v Speaker 5>It isn't ever really dealt with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why you die.</v>

1008
00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:20.580
<v Speaker 5>You can only manage it to a limited</v>
<v Speaker 5>degree.</v>

1009
00:56:20.581 --> 00:56:24.760
<v Speaker 5>And for us that's like three kids in 100</v>
<v Speaker 5>years if you're lucky.</v>

1010
00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:27.760
<v Speaker 5>And that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's hard knowledge after three and a</v>

1011
00:56:27.761 --> 00:56:30.580
<v Speaker 5>half billion years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the complexity problem is a rough</v>

1012
00:56:30.581 --> 00:56:31.990
<v Speaker 5>one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>

1013
00:56:31.991 --> 00:56:35.230
<v Speaker 5>So that's your body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now let's look inside your body.</v>

1014
00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:38.550
<v Speaker 5>Now you might think that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1015
00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:41.560
<v Speaker 5>we have this sort of idea that's kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>a leftover Cartesian,</v>

1016
00:56:41.561 --> 00:56:45.250
<v Speaker 5>that there's a you and there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your body and the EU is in your brain.</v>

1017
00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:49.750
<v Speaker 5>And so just out of curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how many of you have the subjective</v>

1018
00:56:49.751 --> 00:56:54.751
<v Speaker 5>sense that the EU is in your head?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many of you would locate you?</v>

1019
00:56:56.021 --> 00:56:58.780
<v Speaker 5>Like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can locate me somewhere.</v>

1020
00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:01.810
<v Speaker 5>Seems to be about there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like that's where I am.</v>

1021
00:57:02.310 --> 00:57:05.500
<v Speaker 5>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so how many of people think have</v>

1022
00:57:05.501 --> 00:57:08.350
<v Speaker 5>like the center of their sense of</v>
<v Speaker 5>subjectivity in their head?</v>

1023
00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:10.990
<v Speaker 5>How many people are like that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1024
00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:13.600
<v Speaker 5>How many people are different than that?</v>

1025
00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:15.651
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

1026
00:57:15.651 --> 00:57:16.281
<v Speaker 5>Oh good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1027
00:57:16.281 --> 00:57:18.800
<v Speaker 5>So where,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where do you feel the center of your</v>

1028
00:57:18.801 --> 00:57:20.300
<v Speaker 5>subjectivity?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where would it be?</v>

1029
00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:32.320
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was thinking more about how about how</v>

1030
00:57:32.321 --> 00:57:33.640
<v Speaker 5>it feels fair,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fair enough.</v>

1031
00:57:33.641 --> 00:57:35.800
<v Speaker 5>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know that that's perfectly</v>

1032
00:57:35.801 --> 00:57:37.450
<v Speaker 5>reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm thinking of it more as a subjective</v>

1033
00:57:37.451 --> 00:57:38.350
<v Speaker 5>experience though.</v>

1034
00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:41.063
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1035
00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:47.060
<v Speaker 5>And so you're kind of located here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many people would would agree with</v>

1036
00:57:47.061 --> 00:57:48.500
<v Speaker 5>that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1037
00:57:48.501 --> 00:57:50.810
<v Speaker 5>So quite a few of you a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's the same.</v>

1038
00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:53.510
<v Speaker 5>Same for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>More like here.</v>

1039
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:55.100
<v Speaker 5>Oh Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hm.</v>

1040
00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:57.200
<v Speaker 5>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Any other places?</v>

1041
00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:00.190
<v Speaker 5>Any other places you can talk about?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

1042
00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:03.411
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1043
00:58:03.411 --> 00:58:08.411
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Any other places?</v>

1044
00:58:13.550 --> 00:58:17.000
<v Speaker 5>Oh that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1045
00:58:17.001 --> 00:58:17.950
<v Speaker 5>I'm kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm kidding.</v>

1046
00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:19.580
<v Speaker 5>I'm kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1047
00:58:19.581 --> 00:58:20.420
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So okay,</v>

1048
00:58:20.421 --> 00:58:22.220
<v Speaker 5>so we've kind of gone hand in heart and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1049
00:58:22.221 --> 00:58:24.350
<v Speaker 5>that's really kind of historically</v>
<v Speaker 5>standard.</v>

1050
00:58:24.351 --> 00:58:27.470
<v Speaker 5>The Greek seemed to look have located</v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves sort of in their heart.</v>

1051
00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:29.690
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when there is some theory that as people</v>

1052
00:58:29.691 --> 00:58:33.800
<v Speaker 5>became more intellectualized that that</v>
<v Speaker 5>feeling sort of went up to their head</v>

1053
00:58:33.801 --> 00:58:36.290
<v Speaker 5>and maybe before the heart there was the</v>
<v Speaker 5>stomach,</v>

1054
00:58:36.310 --> 00:58:37.280
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

1055
00:58:37.281 --> 00:58:39.740
<v Speaker 5>you might think that you're your stomach</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you were hungry all the time.</v>

1056
00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:40.641
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1057
00:58:40.641 --> 00:58:43.190
<v Speaker 5>you're just not ever hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like why the hell would you think you</v>

1058
00:58:43.191 --> 00:58:44.870
<v Speaker 5>were in your stomach?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

1059
00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:48.200
<v Speaker 5>that's another way that culture sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>keeps complexity at bay.</v>

1060
00:58:48.410 --> 00:58:52.100
<v Speaker 5>You don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's almost like a motivational state</v>

1061
00:58:52.101 --> 00:58:55.940
<v Speaker 5>that modern people don't even have to</v>
<v Speaker 5>contend with because you're never really</v>

1062
00:58:55.941 --> 00:58:56.691
<v Speaker 5>hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1063
00:58:56.691 --> 00:58:59.690
<v Speaker 5>how many of you have gone without food</v>
<v Speaker 5>for more than 24 hours?</v>

1064
00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:02.241
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's pretty good.</v>

1065
00:59:02.241 --> 00:59:06.020
<v Speaker 5>How many of you in voluntarily went</v>
<v Speaker 5>without food for more than 24 hours?</v>

1066
00:59:06.590 --> 00:59:07.341
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's,</v>

1067
00:59:07.341 --> 00:59:08.590
<v Speaker 5>that's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1068
00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:11.980
<v Speaker 5>How about a week?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody.</v>

1069
00:59:11.981 --> 00:59:13.060
<v Speaker 5>How about three days?</v>

1070
00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:16.361
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1071
00:59:16.361 --> 00:59:18.370
<v Speaker 5>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a couple of people who've gone</v>

1072
00:59:18.371 --> 00:59:20.530
<v Speaker 5>for reasonable periods of time without</v>
<v Speaker 5>eating,</v>

1073
00:59:20.531 --> 00:59:24.680
<v Speaker 5>but fundamentally you can tell we we of</v>
<v Speaker 5>got that problem under control so you</v>

1074
00:59:24.681 --> 00:59:28.010
<v Speaker 5>don't have to worry too much about your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about you being your stomach,</v>

1075
00:59:28.011 --> 00:59:30.230
<v Speaker 5>but I'll tell you if you were starving</v>
<v Speaker 5>at some point,</v>

1076
00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:33.410
<v Speaker 5>that's probably where you'd locate</v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself.</v>

1077
00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:35.540
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so now you're inside the body and so</v>

1078
00:59:35.541 --> 00:59:37.700
<v Speaker 5>let's take a look at how the body works</v>
<v Speaker 5>inside.</v>

1079
00:59:37.701 --> 00:59:40.460
<v Speaker 5>So you kind of feel that you're in your</v>
<v Speaker 5>brain,</v>

1080
00:59:40.461 --> 00:59:42.230
<v Speaker 5>most of you anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1081
00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:44.270
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you kind of think your brain is in your</v>

1082
00:59:44.271 --> 00:59:46.250
<v Speaker 5>head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but really that's not right.</v>

1083
00:59:46.251 --> 00:59:51.110
<v Speaker 5>I don't really understand ever why we</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of decided that our brains,</v>

1084
00:59:51.111 --> 00:59:52.190
<v Speaker 5>we're in our head because.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1085
00:59:52.191 --> 00:59:53.000
<v Speaker 5>look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

1086
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.880
<v Speaker 5>there's the nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's not in your hand.</v>

1087
00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:57.830
<v Speaker 5>It's distributed through your whole</v>
<v Speaker 5>body.</v>

1088
00:59:58.070 --> 01:00:01.520
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of it up in your head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's the whole spinal cord.</v>

1089
01:00:01.521 --> 01:00:04.340
<v Speaker 5>That's an important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then it has all these branching</v>

1090
01:00:04.341 --> 01:00:07.250
<v Speaker 5>nerves that allow you to move your hands</v>
<v Speaker 5>and to feel things.</v>

1091
01:00:07.251 --> 01:00:09.920
<v Speaker 5>And it's like your nervous system is</v>
<v Speaker 5>distributed all the way through your</v>

1092
01:00:09.921 --> 01:00:13.010
<v Speaker 5>body,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's not reasonable to think about</v>

1093
01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:17.120
<v Speaker 5>the way that you operate as you see</v>
<v Speaker 5>things with your brain.</v>

1094
01:00:17.121 --> 01:00:20.120
<v Speaker 5>And then you do things now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if that's sort of true,</v>

1095
01:00:20.330 --> 01:00:22.370
<v Speaker 5>but there's important ways that it's not</v>
<v Speaker 5>true at all.</v>

1096
01:00:22.371 --> 01:00:25.190
<v Speaker 5>And it's important to know the ways that</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not true.</v>

1097
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:28.220
<v Speaker 5>It helps you understand phenomena that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you couldn't otherwise understand.</v>

1098
01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:32.690
<v Speaker 5>So I can give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are people who experience</v>

1099
01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:34.370
<v Speaker 5>blindness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

1100
01:00:34.371 --> 01:00:37.100
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't because their eyes get</v>
<v Speaker 5>damaged just because they have brain</v>

1101
01:00:37.101 --> 01:00:37.934
<v Speaker 5>damage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so it,</v>

1102
01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.830
<v Speaker 5>it damages the visual cortex.</v>

1103
01:00:39.830 --> 01:00:42.890
<v Speaker 5>And so that's the higher order,</v>
<v Speaker 5>higher order part of the brain that's</v>

1104
01:00:42.891 --> 01:00:45.500
<v Speaker 5>responsible for conscious vision.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1105
01:00:45.501 --> 01:00:46.970
<v Speaker 5>So maybe they get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

1106
01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:49.070
<v Speaker 5>they get a tumor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get hit in the head or they get</v>

1107
01:00:49.071 --> 01:00:51.260
<v Speaker 5>shot or something and then poof,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're blind.</v>

1108
01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.750
<v Speaker 5>And so then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1109
01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:56.330
<v Speaker 5>they tell you they can't see anything</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you say to them,</v>

1110
01:00:56.331 --> 01:00:57.590
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well that's fine.</v>

1111
01:00:57.591 --> 01:00:59.750
<v Speaker 5>You can't see anything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but let's play a game.</v>

1112
01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:02.150
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to hold up my left hand or my</v>

1113
01:01:02.151 --> 01:01:06.080
<v Speaker 5>right hand and you're going to guess</v>
<v Speaker 5>about which I'm holding up.</v>

1114
01:01:06.081 --> 01:01:09.050
<v Speaker 5>And so you do this and they go right and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you do this.</v>

1115
01:01:09.051 --> 01:01:11.000
<v Speaker 5>And they go left,</v>
<v Speaker 5>left,</v>

1116
01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:12.920
<v Speaker 5>left,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

1117
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:15.140
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they're right.</v>

1118
01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:17.210
<v Speaker 5>And you tell them you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they say,</v>

1119
01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:18.890
<v Speaker 5>well I can't because I don't see</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>

1120
01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:21.860
<v Speaker 5>So that's one that's blind sight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1121
01:01:21.861 --> 01:01:23.300
<v Speaker 5>So here's another kind of blind sight.</v>

1122
01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:28.040
<v Speaker 5>So you take the same person and you set</v>
<v Speaker 5>them in front of the screen and you say,</v>

1123
01:01:28.041 --> 01:01:29.570
<v Speaker 5>well look at the screen and they tell</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1124
01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:34.280
<v Speaker 5>I told you already I can't see anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you flash faces at them and</v>

1125
01:01:34.281 --> 01:01:35.180
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1126
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:38.600
<v Speaker 5>you check for changes in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>conductivity of their skin.</v>

1127
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:41.870
<v Speaker 5>Because when people react emotionally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they sweat a little more,</v>

1128
01:01:41.871 --> 01:01:45.500
<v Speaker 5>a little less than that changes how</v>
<v Speaker 5>electricity passes through their skin.</v>

1129
01:01:45.501 --> 01:01:49.020
<v Speaker 5>And so you show them a smiling face and</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's not much of a change and you</v>

1130
01:01:49.021 --> 01:01:51.890
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you show them a neutral face and there's</v>

1131
01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:54.650
<v Speaker 5>not much of a change.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you show them like a really</v>

1132
01:01:54.651 --> 01:01:59.270
<v Speaker 5>aggressive or really afraid face and</v>
<v Speaker 5>poof spikes and you do that in a number</v>

1133
01:01:59.271 --> 01:02:02.060
<v Speaker 5>of times and you show them well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And as soon as I show you a face of</v>

1134
01:02:02.061 --> 01:02:04.970
<v Speaker 5>someone who's afraid or face,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if someone who's angry,</v>

1135
01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:07.790
<v Speaker 5>you react to it psychophysiological you</v>
<v Speaker 5>think,</v>

1136
01:02:07.791 --> 01:02:10.220
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how the hell can that happen if they</v>

1137
01:02:10.221 --> 01:02:11.054
<v Speaker 5>can't see?</v>

1138
01:02:11.650 --> 01:02:16.650
<v Speaker 5>And the answer that is you don't just</v>
<v Speaker 5>see with your vision you see with your</v>

1139
01:02:17.121 --> 01:02:19.620
<v Speaker 5>body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so one of the things that you'll</v>

1140
01:02:19.621 --> 01:02:20.431
<v Speaker 5>find,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

1141
01:02:20.431 --> 01:02:24.120
<v Speaker 5>if you go through Swanson's paper,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll read you a little bit about this</v>

1142
01:02:24.121 --> 01:02:27.060
<v Speaker 5>later,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that most of your senses map onto</v>

1143
01:02:27.061 --> 01:02:31.530
<v Speaker 5>multiple levels of your nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So some of them not right onto your</v>

1144
01:02:31.531 --> 01:02:34.560
<v Speaker 5>spine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's good because now and then</v>

1145
01:02:34.561 --> 01:02:37.410
<v Speaker 5>your eyes should tell your spine to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>something before you think,</v>

1146
01:02:38.050 --> 01:02:40.800
<v Speaker 5>because thinkings too slow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so you know,</v>

1147
01:02:40.801 --> 01:02:43.920
<v Speaker 5>you gotta understand like way back when</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were frogs,</v>

1148
01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:46.260
<v Speaker 5>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we had eyes.</v>

1149
01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:50.040
<v Speaker 5>We didn't have much of a brain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like what the hell were the eyes</v>

1150
01:02:50.041 --> 01:02:53.100
<v Speaker 5>doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not like the frog exactly sees.</v>

1151
01:02:53.790 --> 01:02:54.750
<v Speaker 5>And you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1152
01:02:54.810 --> 01:02:57.990
<v Speaker 5>how could eyes inform you about the</v>
<v Speaker 5>world if you don't?</v>

1153
01:02:57.991 --> 01:03:00.530
<v Speaker 5>Exactly see?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you got to kind of think about</v>

1154
01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:01.770
<v Speaker 5>it didn't appear as jetty and sense.</v>

1155
01:03:01.770 --> 01:03:04.310
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here,</v>

1156
01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:07.230
<v Speaker 5>here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You might take an animal like a sponge,</v>

1157
01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:12.290
<v Speaker 5>pretty simple animal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it can open and close doors on the</v>

1158
01:03:12.391 --> 01:03:17.391
<v Speaker 5>outside of its surface according to</v>
<v Speaker 5>different changes in the ocean that</v>

1159
01:03:18.661 --> 01:03:21.360
<v Speaker 5>surrounds it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so it's perception.</v>

1160
01:03:21.361 --> 01:03:24.570
<v Speaker 5>It's sort of like the ocean has three</v>
<v Speaker 5>states,</v>

1161
01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:26.220
<v Speaker 5>whatever those might be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it has 10,</v>

1162
01:03:26.221 --> 01:03:28.110
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But for the sake of simplicity,</v>

1163
01:03:28.111 --> 01:03:31.290
<v Speaker 5>we'll say three.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The ocean manifests itself in three</v>

1164
01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:35.940
<v Speaker 5>patterns states in pattern state one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do this in pattern state too.</v>

1165
01:03:35.941 --> 01:03:40.110
<v Speaker 5>I do this in pattern state three,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do this and so it's direct pattern</v>

1166
01:03:40.111 --> 01:03:44.040
<v Speaker 5>onto action mapping.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so animals can use the rice just to</v>

1167
01:03:44.041 --> 01:03:47.160
<v Speaker 5>react with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't have to see that thing,</v>

1168
01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:49.200
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you think you see and then you</v>

1169
01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:50.670
<v Speaker 5>act.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But why do that?</v>

1170
01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:54.360
<v Speaker 5>You can just react and you knew this</v>
<v Speaker 5>already because in a simple way,</v>

1171
01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:58.950
<v Speaker 5>if you put your hand on a hot stove,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll go like this and then you'll feel</v>

1172
01:03:58.951 --> 01:04:02.250
<v Speaker 5>the pain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and what that means is that your body</v>

1173
01:04:02.251 --> 01:04:06.210
<v Speaker 5>has conserved the relationship between</v>
<v Speaker 5>your sensory neurons and your motor</v>

1174
01:04:06.211 --> 01:04:09.000
<v Speaker 5>neurons out of spinal level so that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>will.</v>

1175
01:04:09.030 --> 01:04:14.030
<v Speaker 5>Your perception of the heat is this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not the heat.</v>

1176
01:04:15.210 --> 01:04:19.350
<v Speaker 5>It's just mapping a bodily pattern onto</v>
<v Speaker 5>a sensory pattern,</v>

1177
01:04:20.430 --> 01:04:25.050
<v Speaker 5>and so a lot of really primitive sensory</v>
<v Speaker 5>input is exactly that.</v>

1178
01:04:25.051 --> 01:04:29.610
<v Speaker 5>It's just the sensor detects a pattern</v>
<v Speaker 5>and with no intermediary of</v>

1179
01:04:29.611 --> 01:04:32.550
<v Speaker 5>interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that pattern is translated into a</v>

1180
01:04:32.551 --> 01:04:37.530
<v Speaker 5>behavioral output.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's actually generally the first,</v>

1181
01:04:37.531 --> 01:04:39.600
<v Speaker 5>the simplest cells or sensory motor</v>
<v Speaker 5>cells.</v>

1182
01:04:39.601 --> 01:04:42.600
<v Speaker 5>So they do both.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They map the pattern and the react and</v>

1183
01:04:42.601 --> 01:04:47.220
<v Speaker 5>then the sensory and the motor cells</v>
<v Speaker 5>differentiate and then neuro tissue</v>

1184
01:04:47.221 --> 01:04:50.730
<v Speaker 5>grows inside them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so then what happens is that instead</v>

1185
01:04:50.731 --> 01:04:54.510
<v Speaker 5>of an outside pattern being mapped</v>
<v Speaker 5>immediately onto a behavioral pattern,</v>

1186
01:04:54.810 --> 01:04:57.540
<v Speaker 5>the neuro intermediary says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1187
01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:00.780
<v Speaker 5>this pattern could mean that any of</v>
<v Speaker 5>these three things,</v>

1188
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:04.770
<v Speaker 5>and then that neural layer grows and</v>
<v Speaker 5>grows and grows.</v>

1189
01:05:04.771 --> 01:05:07.410
<v Speaker 5>Until being creatures like us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like a whopping layer,</v>

1190
01:05:07.411 --> 01:05:09.840
<v Speaker 5>and so we see a pattern and we go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that could be this,</v>

1191
01:05:09.841 --> 01:05:10.351
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

1192
01:05:10.351 --> 01:05:10.891
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

1193
01:05:10.891 --> 01:05:11.431
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

1194
01:05:11.431 --> 01:05:13.590
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then all of those things could be</v>

1195
01:05:13.591 --> 01:05:15.720
<v Speaker 5>mapped onto this or this or this or this</v>
<v Speaker 5>or this.</v>

1196
01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:17.860
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it makes us more slower,</v>

1197
01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:20.740
<v Speaker 5>but more flexible and slow can be a</v>
<v Speaker 5>problem.</v>

1198
01:05:20.741 --> 01:05:23.290
<v Speaker 5>So like when you're walking down a</v>
<v Speaker 5>pathway and the snake appears,</v>

1199
01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:26.050
<v Speaker 5>you don't want to be thinking snake,</v>
<v Speaker 5>rubber,</v>

1200
01:05:26.051 --> 01:05:27.040
<v Speaker 5>hose,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stick,</v>

1201
01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:28.360
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1202
01:05:28.510 --> 01:05:30.250
<v Speaker 5>because then you're dead because the</v>
<v Speaker 5>snake bites you.</v>

1203
01:05:30.251 --> 01:05:33.280
<v Speaker 5>What you want to do is catch the snake</v>
<v Speaker 5>out of the corner of your eye and jump</v>

1204
01:05:33.281 --> 01:05:36.610
<v Speaker 5>up into the air before you even know</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you saw a snake.</v>

1205
01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:40.690
<v Speaker 5>And you can do that because your eyes</v>
<v Speaker 5>can map right onto your spine and they</v>

1206
01:05:40.691 --> 01:05:43.840
<v Speaker 5>don't just map right onto your spine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They map onto your nervous system and</v>

1207
01:05:43.841 --> 01:05:45.580
<v Speaker 5>all sorts of levels.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So for example,</v>

1208
01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:50.230
<v Speaker 5>with the blind sight person who's</v>
<v Speaker 5>looking at the face,</v>

1209
01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:53.680
<v Speaker 5>so it's an angry face,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the eyes are still mapping information</v>

1210
01:05:53.681 --> 01:05:57.580
<v Speaker 5>onto the Amygdala and the amygdala</v>
<v Speaker 5>changes the psychophysiology.</v>

1211
01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.310
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it says prepare for threat and so the</v>

1212
01:06:00.311 --> 01:06:04.120
<v Speaker 5>person might feel uneasy but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's weird,</v>

1213
01:06:04.121 --> 01:06:08.320
<v Speaker 5>but that's a form of site to feel uneasy</v>
<v Speaker 5>can be a form of site.</v>

1214
01:06:09.310 --> 01:06:14.310
<v Speaker 5>So</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's to say even more clearly that</v>

1215
01:06:15.191 --> 01:06:17.800
<v Speaker 5>your brain just isn't in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's all the way up.</v>

1216
01:06:17.830 --> 01:06:21.060
<v Speaker 5>It's all the way from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is a nice pot of viewpoint</v>

1217
01:06:21.070 --> 01:06:23.710
<v Speaker 5>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in some sense what Piaget says about</v>

1218
01:06:23.711 --> 01:06:27.130
<v Speaker 5>children is they sort of organize</v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves from the spinal level</v>

1219
01:06:27.131 --> 01:06:28.080
<v Speaker 5>upwards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1220
01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:30.460
<v Speaker 5>they learn these little sub routines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

1221
01:06:30.461 --> 01:06:34.390
<v Speaker 5>they have a few sub routine so it was</v>
<v Speaker 5>like built right into the spine and then</v>

1222
01:06:34.391 --> 01:06:37.660
<v Speaker 5>they start playing with those and</v>
<v Speaker 5>chaining them together in flexible ways</v>

1223
01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:39.460
<v Speaker 5>and they keep doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1224
01:06:39.550 --> 01:06:43.330
<v Speaker 5>in more and more complex ways until</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're capable of the abstract</v>

1225
01:06:43.331 --> 01:06:47.200
<v Speaker 5>representation of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you can see how this will work as we</v>

1226
01:06:47.201 --> 01:06:48.970
<v Speaker 5>go through the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the nervous system.</v>

1227
01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:54.180
<v Speaker 5>So your brains in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in fact there's some evidence and</v>

1228
01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:56.200
<v Speaker 5>there's more than one kind of nervous</v>
<v Speaker 5>system too,</v>

1229
01:06:56.201 --> 01:06:56.410
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1230
01:06:56.410 --> 01:07:00.790
<v Speaker 5>There's the central nervous system that</v>
<v Speaker 5>allows you to move voluntarily and that</v>

1231
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>provides you with sensory feedback,</v>

1232
01:07:03.491 --> 01:07:06.370
<v Speaker 5>some of which you're conscious of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's also the autonomic nervous</v>

1233
01:07:06.371 --> 01:07:09.970
<v Speaker 5>system that runs your all the complex</v>
<v Speaker 5>machinery that you're too stupid to</v>

1234
01:07:09.971 --> 01:07:14.200
<v Speaker 5>attend to because your consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 5>gets little jobs.</v>

1235
01:07:14.650 --> 01:07:16.690
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't get to run your liver.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For example.</v>

1236
01:07:16.691 --> 01:07:19.510
<v Speaker 5>You imagine what your life would be like</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you were in charge of your liver.</v>

1237
01:07:19.690 --> 01:07:22.900
<v Speaker 5>It's like you'd have been dead years ago</v>
<v Speaker 5>because what do you know about livers?</v>

1238
01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:27.250
<v Speaker 5>So you have a whole system like the</v>
<v Speaker 5>autonomic nervous system which has more</v>

1239
01:07:27.251 --> 01:07:31.180
<v Speaker 5>neurons than the central nervous system</v>
<v Speaker 5>that just runs all that stuff for you,</v>

1240
01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:34.540
<v Speaker 5>which is a good thing you do and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't have to pay attention to it.</v>

1241
01:07:34.990 --> 01:07:36.940
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So anyways,</v>

1242
01:07:36.941 --> 01:07:41.941
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of distribution of neural</v>
<v Speaker 5>tissue throughout your body and there's</v>

1243
01:07:42.191 --> 01:07:47.110
<v Speaker 5>even some evidence that you have a like</v>
<v Speaker 5>a second brain of sorts in your solar</v>

1244
01:07:47.111 --> 01:07:50.230
<v Speaker 5>plexus where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's perhaps part of the reason why</v>

1245
01:07:50.231 --> 01:07:53.200
<v Speaker 5>you really don't like to get hit there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there's a tremendous number of</v>

1246
01:07:53.201 --> 01:07:55.000
<v Speaker 5>serotonergic neurons,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

1247
01:07:55.001 --> 01:07:56.650
<v Speaker 5>in your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in your midsection,</v>

1248
01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:59.890
<v Speaker 5>and there's increasing evidence that</v>
<v Speaker 5>those are associated with things like</v>

1249
01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:04.780
<v Speaker 5>emotion and mood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so the idea that the brain is here,</v>

1250
01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:07.240
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1251
01:08:07.570 --> 01:08:08.770
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not really.</v>

1252
01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:10.210
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a continuum.</v>

1253
01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:14.950
<v Speaker 5>You know your body is a</v>
<v Speaker 5>psychophysiological entity and to</v>

1254
01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:18.920
<v Speaker 5>separate it into body and mind is like</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not right.</v>

1255
01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:24.290
<v Speaker 5>The other thing that seems to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>increasingly clear among say the</v>

1256
01:08:24.291 --> 01:08:26.630
<v Speaker 5>robotics guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't even be smart unless you have</v>

1257
01:08:26.631 --> 01:08:30.140
<v Speaker 5>a body,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so that's why the advanced advanced</v>

1258
01:08:30.230 --> 01:08:34.310
<v Speaker 5>intelligence guys are building robots</v>
<v Speaker 5>from the bottom up.</v>

1259
01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:36.590
<v Speaker 5>They're doing it just like piaget would</v>
<v Speaker 5>have suggested.</v>

1260
01:08:36.591 --> 01:08:37.131
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1261
01:08:37.131 --> 01:08:40.460
<v Speaker 5>build some things that can move and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>chain those things that can move</v>

1262
01:08:40.461 --> 01:08:43.670
<v Speaker 5>together so that they can move in more</v>
<v Speaker 5>complex ways and then chain them</v>

1263
01:08:43.671 --> 01:08:45.740
<v Speaker 5>together so they can work in more</v>
<v Speaker 5>complex ways.</v>

1264
01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:48.470
<v Speaker 5>And once you've got this thing that can</v>
<v Speaker 5>do things,</v>

1265
01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:52.400
<v Speaker 5>then stick a brain on it and that'll.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then it'll have things it can do with</v>

1266
01:08:52.401 --> 01:08:54.350
<v Speaker 5>its brain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you don't do it that way,</v>

1267
01:08:54.351 --> 01:08:57.470
<v Speaker 5>you get something that can't function</v>
<v Speaker 5>intelligently,</v>

1268
01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:59.990
<v Speaker 5>it's close to that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1269
01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:06.080
<v Speaker 5>so there is the brain and the major one</v>
<v Speaker 5>way of dividing it into its major</v>

1270
01:09:07.041 --> 01:09:08.900
<v Speaker 5>subcomponents is represented.</v>

1271
01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:10.340
<v Speaker 5>There's a variety of ways you can do</v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

1272
01:09:10.341 --> 01:09:12.620
<v Speaker 5>You can divide it into hemispheres</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's sort of split down the</v>

1273
01:09:12.621 --> 01:09:15.080
<v Speaker 5>middle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The right hemisphere seems to be kind of</v>

1274
01:09:15.081 --> 01:09:19.010
<v Speaker 5>specialized for the processing of</v>
<v Speaker 5>unknown information.</v>

1275
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:23.930
<v Speaker 5>And the left seems to be more</v>
<v Speaker 5>comfortable working where you know</v>

1276
01:09:23.931 --> 01:09:28.190
<v Speaker 5>what's going to happen and that the left</v>
<v Speaker 5>is most generally the linguistic part of</v>

1277
01:09:28.191 --> 01:09:29.390
<v Speaker 5>the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Although not always,</v>

1278
01:09:29.391 --> 01:09:30.440
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a rough,</v>

1279
01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:32.150
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what would you call it?</v>

1280
01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:36.380
<v Speaker 5>It's a rough truth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's lots of exceptions.</v>

1281
01:09:36.730 --> 01:09:40.760
<v Speaker 5>The linguistic systems tends to</v>
<v Speaker 5>specialize in the left and the left</v>

1282
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:43.760
<v Speaker 5>sorta insists that it knows what's going</v>
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>

1283
01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:47.480
<v Speaker 5>And the right is always looking out for</v>
<v Speaker 5>things that don't fit and sort of</v>

1284
01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:51.800
<v Speaker 5>convincing the left slowly and sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>under the table to change its</v>

1285
01:09:51.801 --> 01:09:52.970
<v Speaker 5>viewpoints.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that seemed.</v>

1286
01:09:52.971 --> 01:09:55.250
<v Speaker 5>A lot of that seems to happen when</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're asleep and you're dreaming.</v>

1287
01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:57.860
<v Speaker 5>So the right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe what's happening when you're</v>

1288
01:09:57.861 --> 01:10:01.490
<v Speaker 5>dreaming is that during the day your</v>
<v Speaker 5>cognitive processes are pretty tight and</v>

1289
01:10:01.491 --> 01:10:05.990
<v Speaker 5>defined and they better be right because</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't want to be dreaming your</v>

1290
01:10:05.991 --> 01:10:08.660
<v Speaker 5>schizophrenia dreams in the daytime.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a bad idea.</v>

1291
01:10:09.170 --> 01:10:13.580
<v Speaker 5>So you gotta stay kind of focused and</v>
<v Speaker 5>narrow in a way during the day.</v>

1292
01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:17.930
<v Speaker 5>But the problem with that narrowed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>narrow focus is that you're not paying</v>

1293
01:10:17.931 --> 01:10:20.870
<v Speaker 5>attention to a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so it kind of looks like your right</v>

1294
01:10:20.871 --> 01:10:24.260
<v Speaker 5>hemisphere keeps track of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>potentially important things that you're</v>

1295
01:10:24.261 --> 01:10:28.410
<v Speaker 5>not keeping track of and sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then at night you're,</v>

1296
01:10:28.650 --> 01:10:31.340
<v Speaker 5>your category system sort of broadens</v>
<v Speaker 5>and loosens.</v>

1297
01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:33.380
<v Speaker 5>You can tell that in dreams because</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're so weird.</v>

1298
01:10:33.381 --> 01:10:37.250
<v Speaker 5>And that's maybe when the right</v>
<v Speaker 5>hemisphere sort of tapping some new</v>

1299
01:10:37.251 --> 01:10:41.510
<v Speaker 5>information into the left and playing</v>
<v Speaker 5>with how it might be recategorized</v>

1300
01:10:41.511 --> 01:10:44.540
<v Speaker 5>without completely overwhelming the left</v>
<v Speaker 5>because</v>

1301
01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:48.710
<v Speaker 5>you don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just because you learn something new,</v>

1302
01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:50.600
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't mean you want to upset</v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself.</v>

1303
01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:51.351
<v Speaker 5>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1304
01:10:51.351 --> 01:10:55.340
<v Speaker 5>So it's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a real complex dynamic between</v>

1305
01:10:55.341 --> 01:10:58.490
<v Speaker 5>stability and learning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's conceivable that's why you have</v>

1306
01:10:58.491 --> 01:11:00.980
<v Speaker 5>two hemispheres.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So who knows,</v>

1307
01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:04.250
<v Speaker 5>it's good in theory though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the guy who came up with it</v>

1308
01:11:04.251 --> 01:11:06.110
<v Speaker 5>fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his name is Goldberg,</v>

1309
01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:09.980
<v Speaker 5>Alconan Goldberg.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was a student of Alexander</v>

1310
01:11:09.981 --> 01:11:11.760
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] who was a great</v>
<v Speaker 5>neuropsychologist.</v>

1311
01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:13.380
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's credible.</v>

1312
01:11:13.381 --> 01:11:18.090
<v Speaker 5>It's credible idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So here's some rough divisions.</v>

1313
01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:21.990
<v Speaker 5>You've got your cerebellum that</v>
<v Speaker 5>cerebellum,</v>

1314
01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:24.900
<v Speaker 5>we don't know what the hell that thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>does if you don't have one,</v>

1315
01:11:24.901 --> 01:11:27.660
<v Speaker 5>you get a little wobbly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's more neurons in the</v>

1316
01:11:27.661 --> 01:11:29.970
<v Speaker 5>cerebellum than there are in the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the brain.</v>

1317
01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:33.150
<v Speaker 5>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it just making you not wobbly?</v>

1318
01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:37.950
<v Speaker 5>It seems like a tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 5>devotion of resources to something</v>

1319
01:11:37.951 --> 01:11:42.951
<v Speaker 5>that's relatively simple.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So a hall when you're a new drinker,</v>

1320
01:11:43.081 --> 01:11:45.480
<v Speaker 5>alcohol's really hard on the Cerebellum,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is why you're,</v>

1321
01:11:45.810 --> 01:11:48.600
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>totally useless in a motorway and you</v>

1322
01:11:48.601 --> 01:11:50.120
<v Speaker 5>fall down and all those things happened.</v>

1323
01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:52.560
<v Speaker 5>But.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's the cerebellum and we don't</v>

1324
01:11:52.561 --> 01:11:55.870
<v Speaker 5>know what it does even though it's very</v>
<v Speaker 5>complex,</v>

1325
01:11:55.871 --> 01:11:58.020
<v Speaker 5>highly branched.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It kind of looks like a cauliflower and</v>

1326
01:11:58.021 --> 01:12:01.320
<v Speaker 5>it's just packed full of neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then there's the occipital lobe and</v>

1327
01:12:01.321 --> 01:12:04.080
<v Speaker 5>that kind of use that to see with more</v>
<v Speaker 5>or less.</v>

1328
01:12:04.081 --> 01:12:08.550
<v Speaker 5>And then the prior lobe Kinda keeps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it helps keep track of who,</v>

1329
01:12:08.610 --> 01:12:12.570
<v Speaker 5>who you are from a bodily perspective</v>
<v Speaker 5>and sort of where your body's located in</v>

1330
01:12:12.571 --> 01:12:15.690
<v Speaker 5>space and sort of who you are as an</v>
<v Speaker 5>embodied person.</v>

1331
01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:18.480
<v Speaker 5>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you lose the right parietal lobe</v>

1332
01:12:18.481 --> 01:12:21.600
<v Speaker 5>because you have a stroke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you lose the left side of your body</v>

1333
01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:25.680
<v Speaker 5>and even more weirdly you lose the left</v>
<v Speaker 5>side of everything.</v>

1334
01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:28.320
<v Speaker 5>So all of a sudden you can't see the</v>
<v Speaker 5>left side of it.</v>

1335
01:12:28.350 --> 01:12:32.490
<v Speaker 5>Anything and no one can figure out what</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's like because say I'm looking at</v>

1336
01:12:32.491 --> 01:12:35.970
<v Speaker 5>this room and I have this parietal</v>
<v Speaker 5>damage.</v>

1337
01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:39.030
<v Speaker 5>If I'm looking at the room,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do I not see the left side of the room?</v>

1338
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:42.000
<v Speaker 5>And then if I look at you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of a sudden I don't see your left</v>

1339
01:12:42.001 --> 01:12:43.620
<v Speaker 5>side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like we can't figure that out.</v>

1340
01:12:44.890 --> 01:12:48.270
<v Speaker 5>Like the left is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then the left is relative to where</v>

1341
01:12:48.271 --> 01:12:51.480
<v Speaker 5>you happen to be looking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think one of the ways of understanding</v>

1342
01:12:51.481 --> 01:12:52.560
<v Speaker 5>it is sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1343
01:12:52.561 --> 01:12:57.561
<v Speaker 5>how you clearly can't see anything</v>
<v Speaker 5>behind your head and it's not black</v>

1344
01:12:57.870 --> 01:12:58.920
<v Speaker 5>where you can't see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1345
01:12:58.921 --> 01:13:03.420
<v Speaker 5>It's black if you close your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there's a difference between what</v>

1346
01:13:03.421 --> 01:13:07.110
<v Speaker 5>you can't see behind your head in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>black you see when you close your eyes</v>

1347
01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:08.850
<v Speaker 5>because the block sort of seems like</v>
<v Speaker 5>nothing.</v>

1348
01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:11.300
<v Speaker 5>But compared to what's behind your head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1349
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:14.250
<v Speaker 5>it's not nothing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think what happens with people who</v>

1350
01:13:14.251 --> 01:13:18.960
<v Speaker 5>have neglect parietal damages that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that like back park just goes like this.</v>

1351
01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:24.090
<v Speaker 5>And so instead of you seeing this much</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the world and this being just not</v>

1352
01:13:24.091 --> 01:13:25.980
<v Speaker 5>there at all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as far as vision is concerned,</v>

1353
01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:29.910
<v Speaker 5>it goes like this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then you've only got like a quarter</v>

1354
01:13:29.911 --> 01:13:32.670
<v Speaker 5>of the world that you're.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so people like that sometimes</v>

1355
01:13:32.671 --> 01:13:35.820
<v Speaker 5>they'll throw their own legs out of bed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>say wake up and they think,</v>

1356
01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:38.340
<v Speaker 5>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because they can kind of detect the left</v>

1357
01:13:38.341 --> 01:13:40.980
<v Speaker 5>but not very well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they're quite freaked out because</v>

1358
01:13:40.981 --> 01:13:41.560
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1359
01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:43.380
<v Speaker 5>do you really want to wake up with a leg</v>
<v Speaker 5>in bed with,</v>

1360
01:13:43.381 --> 01:13:44.980
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they grab it,</v>

1361
01:13:45.010 --> 01:13:46.860
<v Speaker 5>throw it out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's not so good because they're</v>

1362
01:13:46.861 --> 01:13:51.690
<v Speaker 5>attached to it or so they'll eat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll eat and they only eat half the</v>

1363
01:13:51.691 --> 01:13:53.310
<v Speaker 5>food on their plate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you turn the plate,</v>

1364
01:13:53.311 --> 01:13:55.290
<v Speaker 5>then the lead half of the half that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>left.</v>

1365
01:13:55.291 --> 01:13:56.920
<v Speaker 5>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the pride.</v>

1366
01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:01.920
<v Speaker 5>A little temporal lobe</v>
<v Speaker 5>that enables you to here roughly</v>

1367
01:14:02.551 --> 01:14:05.250
<v Speaker 5>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of memory there too.</v>

1368
01:14:05.490 --> 01:14:07.680
<v Speaker 5>And the frontal lobe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well first of all,</v>

1369
01:14:07.681 --> 01:14:12.681
<v Speaker 5>the frontal lobe seems to allow you to</v>
<v Speaker 5>make voluntary movements sort of at the,</v>

1370
01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:17.320
<v Speaker 5>at the highest level of abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the prefrontal Cortex,</v>

1371
01:14:17.321 --> 01:14:19.630
<v Speaker 5>which would be right at the front of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>yellow there.</v>

1372
01:14:20.650 --> 01:14:24.760
<v Speaker 5>It's sort of like the back part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the frontal lobe enables you to make</v>

1373
01:14:24.761 --> 01:14:28.120
<v Speaker 5>voluntary movements,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the prefrontal cortex enables you to</v>

1374
01:14:28.121 --> 01:14:32.710
<v Speaker 5>represent the potential motor movements</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you might make before you implement</v>

1375
01:14:32.711 --> 01:14:35.080
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so it evolved out of the motor</v>

1376
01:14:35.081 --> 01:14:36.640
<v Speaker 5>strip.</v>
<v Speaker 5>During the course of evolution,</v>

1377
01:14:36.641 --> 01:14:38.350
<v Speaker 5>it's sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well first you learn how to act</v>

1378
01:14:38.351 --> 01:14:42.580
<v Speaker 5>voluntarily and then as that grew and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's particularly big in human beings,</v>

1379
01:14:42.850 --> 01:14:46.780
<v Speaker 5>that part was able to divorce actions</v>
<v Speaker 5>from your body,</v>

1380
01:14:48.730 --> 01:14:52.690
<v Speaker 5>represent them in an abstract space,</v>
<v Speaker 5>run the MS simulations,</v>

1381
01:14:52.691 --> 01:14:56.110
<v Speaker 5>calculate the outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then implement them or not and you</v>

1382
01:14:56.111 --> 01:14:56.980
<v Speaker 5>know it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>

1383
01:14:57.220 --> 01:15:02.220
<v Speaker 5>it's a hit and miss business because</v>
<v Speaker 5>lots of you people undoubtedly simulate</v>

1384
01:15:02.741 --> 01:15:06.130
<v Speaker 5>catastrophic outcomes and then go do</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is you were going to do</v>

1385
01:15:06.131 --> 01:15:06.610
<v Speaker 5>anyways.</v>

1386
01:15:06.610 --> 01:15:08.650
<v Speaker 5>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that happens to people all the time say</v>

1387
01:15:08.651 --> 01:15:12.640
<v Speaker 5>when they're trying to stop drinking or</v>
<v Speaker 5>to stop using cocaine or not to binge</v>

1388
01:15:12.641 --> 01:15:14.740
<v Speaker 5>eat or.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>

1389
01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:18.490
<v Speaker 5>your prefrontal Cortex can whip up these</v>
<v Speaker 5>simulations,</v>

1390
01:15:18.491 --> 01:15:21.490
<v Speaker 5>but other parts of your body can</v>
<v Speaker 5>override them quite,</v>

1391
01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:24.700
<v Speaker 5>quite badly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's sort of roughly the brain at</v>

1392
01:15:24.701 --> 01:15:26.100
<v Speaker 5>least from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1393
01:15:26.170 --> 01:15:31.170
<v Speaker 5>looking at it from the side and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is it split down the middle and you</v>

1394
01:15:32.651 --> 01:15:37.270
<v Speaker 5>can see that it's not precisely two</v>
<v Speaker 5>hemispheres all the way down</v>

1395
01:15:39.250 --> 01:15:41.620
<v Speaker 5>in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one thing and then it grows.</v>

1396
01:15:41.621 --> 01:15:46.330
<v Speaker 5>These two things like little hat and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

1397
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:48.790
<v Speaker 5>all the important parts of the brain</v>
<v Speaker 5>brainer,</v>

1398
01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:52.450
<v Speaker 5>low down central,</v>
<v Speaker 5>old,</v>

1399
01:15:53.290 --> 01:15:54.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because people like to think that,</v>

1400
01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:57.040
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they don't evolved a long time ago,</v>

1401
01:15:57.041 --> 01:15:59.170
<v Speaker 5>it's primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1402
01:15:59.171 --> 01:16:02.110
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it evolved a long time ago,</v>

1403
01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:06.460
<v Speaker 5>it's been around a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really smart.</v>

1404
01:16:06.610 --> 01:16:10.720
<v Speaker 5>That's why you don't run your liver.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The autonomic nervous system runs it</v>

1405
01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:13.870
<v Speaker 5>because it's been around for an awful</v>
<v Speaker 5>long time and it knows exactly how to do</v>

1406
01:16:13.871 --> 01:16:15.640
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so it's really,</v>

1407
01:16:15.641 --> 01:16:19.690
<v Speaker 5>in some sense the new parts of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>brains or the brain in many ways are the</v>

1408
01:16:19.691 --> 01:16:23.680
<v Speaker 5>parts that are primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So in the old parts are extremely</v>

1409
01:16:23.681 --> 01:16:27.520
<v Speaker 5>necessary and sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so the areas we're going to</v>

1410
01:16:27.521 --> 01:16:29.880
<v Speaker 5>concentrate on most particularly our</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1411
01:16:29.881 --> 01:16:34.030
<v Speaker 5>the Cortex we've already talked about</v>
<v Speaker 5>the cortex is probably responsible.</v>

1412
01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:38.650
<v Speaker 5>People like to think of it as</v>
<v Speaker 5>responsible for consciousness.</v>

1413
01:16:38.651 --> 01:16:40.570
<v Speaker 5>And there's something about that that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

1414
01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:45.600
<v Speaker 5>but it's quite clear that human beings</v>
<v Speaker 5>can remain conscious even if they have a</v>

1415
01:16:47.531 --> 01:16:50.140
<v Speaker 5>substantial amount of damage to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>cerebral cortex.</v>

1416
01:16:50.141 --> 01:16:54.610
<v Speaker 5>So consciousness is a really weird thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>where we're not very good at figuring</v>

1417
01:16:54.611 --> 01:16:58.090
<v Speaker 5>out where it's localized at all</v>
<v Speaker 5>three book,</v>

1418
01:16:58.091 --> 01:17:00.850
<v Speaker 5>Cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thalamus,</v>

1419
01:17:01.210 --> 01:17:04.330
<v Speaker 5>the Thalamus is the place where all your</v>
<v Speaker 5>sensory information comes together.</v>

1420
01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.430
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you look at the world,</v>

1421
01:17:06.431 --> 01:17:10.100
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of like a continuum of</v>
<v Speaker 5>experience despite the fact that you</v>

1422
01:17:10.101 --> 01:17:14.210
<v Speaker 5>have these five different sensory inputs</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the Thalamus seems to sort of unite</v>

1423
01:17:14.211 --> 01:17:19.211
<v Speaker 5>all that and then it sends the messages</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it amalgamates up to the cortex and</v>

1424
01:17:19.971 --> 01:17:23.120
<v Speaker 5>the cortex sends the back and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thalamus sends them back and there's</v>

1425
01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:28.300
<v Speaker 5>this loop between the fellas and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>cortex and maybe that's part of what</v>

1426
01:17:28.581 --> 01:17:29.820
<v Speaker 5>consciousness is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1427
01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:34.100
<v Speaker 5>rather than being localized in an area,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it could easily be a process and you</v>

1428
01:17:34.101 --> 01:17:36.110
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fact that consciousness sort of</v>

1429
01:17:36.111 --> 01:17:39.260
<v Speaker 5>turns on in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is a very weird thing,</v>

1430
01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:42.500
<v Speaker 5>seems to indicate to me that it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>probably something like that.</v>

1431
01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:45.380
<v Speaker 5>It's a loop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the looping interaction between</v>

1432
01:17:45.381 --> 01:17:48.230
<v Speaker 5>brain areas and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if something's looping like that,</v>

1433
01:17:48.231 --> 01:17:52.760
<v Speaker 5>it gets really weird properties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's a positive feedback system.</v>

1434
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:55.800
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I don't know if you've ever turned a</v>

1435
01:17:55.810 --> 01:17:58.160
<v Speaker 5>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hooked a video camera to a TV and then</v>

1436
01:17:58.161 --> 01:18:00.550
<v Speaker 5>turn the video camera on the TV.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1437
01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:04.310
<v Speaker 5>it starts doing extremely weird things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can get all sorts of unbelievably</v>

1438
01:18:04.311 --> 01:18:09.311
<v Speaker 5>complex designs and weird phenomena</v>
<v Speaker 5>because the TV is recycling its own</v>

1439
01:18:09.741 --> 01:18:11.930
<v Speaker 5>signal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so there's this circuit in there that's</v>

1440
01:18:11.931 --> 01:18:16.931
<v Speaker 5>looping and I suspect consciousness as</v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that of the hippocampus.</v>

1441
01:18:18.170 --> 01:18:23.170
<v Speaker 5>The hippocampus is responsible for the</v>
<v Speaker 5>movement of short term information into</v>

1442
01:18:23.301 --> 01:18:25.610
<v Speaker 5>longterm storage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a very important part of the brain.</v>

1443
01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:29.660
<v Speaker 5>We'll talk about that more next time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The amygdala is responsible for a lot of</v>

1444
01:18:29.661 --> 01:18:34.661
<v Speaker 5>emotional responses and the hypothalamus</v>
<v Speaker 5>is responsible for a lot of primordial</v>

1445
01:18:35.931 --> 01:18:40.931
<v Speaker 5>motivational states.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so we'll stop and we'll start with</v>

1446
01:18:42.791 --> 01:18:47.620
<v Speaker 5>the hypothalamus on Tuesday.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See you soon.</v>
