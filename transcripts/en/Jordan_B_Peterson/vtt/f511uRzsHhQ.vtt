00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Hi Guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2
00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:07.494
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk about the brain </v>

3
00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:10.644
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last lecture I talked to you a little </v>

4
00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:20.400
<v Speaker 1>bit about construct validation and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>it means to measure something.</v>

5
00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:24.510
<v Speaker 1>And so we're gonna take a bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>detour.</v>

6
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.970
<v Speaker 1>So I told you about measurement problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>last time.</v>

7
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.420
<v Speaker 1>If you do your measurement properly in </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychometrics,</v>

8
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.283
<v Speaker 1>if you're studying personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're studying individual </v>

9
00:00:38.791 --> 00:00:39.624
<v Speaker 1>differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are roughly six things that you </v>

10
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>can discover and they can be broken up </v>
<v Speaker 1>in different ways.</v>

11
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.270
<v Speaker 1>That's the big five model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extroversion and neuroticism,</v>

12
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.850
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>

13
00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:56.460
<v Speaker 1>openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can be subdivided as you should</v>

14
00:00:56.461 --> 00:00:57.740
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it principal,</v>

15
00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.583
<v Speaker 1>you've read the paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sub divided them into 10 half turns </v>

16
00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:02.244
<v Speaker 1>out to be quite useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for now we'll just presume that </v>

17
00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:05.604
<v Speaker 1>there are five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other factor of human </v>

18
00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:13.830
<v Speaker 1>function that's pretty easy to derive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and measure his Iq.</v>

19
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.693
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq likely nests under openness because </v>

20
00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:21.390
<v Speaker 1>openness looks like it's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly like intellect,</v>

21
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:23.250
<v Speaker 1>which has interest in ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

22
00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:24.084
<v Speaker 1>that's probably an ability with ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's probably measured better by </v>

23
00:01:27.451 --> 00:01:28.284
<v Speaker 1>an Iq test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I ask you how smart you are and </v>

24
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:30.954
<v Speaker 1>you say you're pretty smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would give you a relatively high </v>

25
00:01:32.761 --> 00:01:36.240
<v Speaker 1>score on the intellect scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I tested your Iq,</v>

26
00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:38.550
<v Speaker 1>I will get a better measure than not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense,</v>

27
00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Iq nests inside the big five model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can think about it as a separate</v>

28
00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:45.270
<v Speaker 1>thing and I think it's reasonable to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

29
00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:46.104
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what you're up to </v>

30
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.023
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when the big five was first </v>

31
00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:55.170
<v Speaker 1>invented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>invented or discovered,</v>

32
00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:59.460
<v Speaker 1>depending on how you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned briefly as well,</v>

33
00:01:59.461 --> 00:02:00.294
<v Speaker 1>it was brute force statistics basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea behind the big five is that </v>

34
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.190
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.023
<v Speaker 1>it's called the lexical hypothesis and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alexa Co hypothesis is that because </v>

36
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.210
<v Speaker 1>human traits are so important to us </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we want to understand ourselves,</v>

37
00:02:15.211 --> 00:02:18.690
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps even more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to understand other people.</v>

38
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:19.763
<v Speaker 1>And because we have language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a reasonable probability that </v>

39
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:27.480
<v Speaker 1>we've encapsulated the structure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>human personality within our language.</v>

40
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.500
<v Speaker 1>And so if you analyze the language </v>
<v Speaker 1>linguistic representations properly,</v>

41
00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:37.590
<v Speaker 1>then perhaps you can extract out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>central personality features.</v>

42
00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:40.420
<v Speaker 1>And that's basically what the lexical </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis is and it,</v>

43
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.263
<v Speaker 1>it's important to know the lexical </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis and it's a bit more </v>

44
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.383
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated than that because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically presumes that you can extract </v>

45
00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:53.790
<v Speaker 1>out route valid information about </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality from adjectives,</v>

46
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.780
<v Speaker 1>descriptive adjectives from phrases and </v>
<v Speaker 1>from questions,</v>

47
00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.883
<v Speaker 1>and you'll get the same basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensional structure regardless of </v>

48
00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:03.424
<v Speaker 1>which of those techniques you use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that turns out to be true for all </v>

49
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 1>intents and purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

50
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.980
<v Speaker 1>the lexical hypothesis depends on its </v>
<v Speaker 1>validity,</v>

51
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.280
<v Speaker 1>depends for its validity on the initial </v>
<v Speaker 1>claim.</v>

52
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:19.323
<v Speaker 1>That personality is accurately </v>
<v Speaker 1>represented within the structure of </v>

53
00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:22.414
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things I would say is </v>

54
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Speaker 1>that there's a week big five hypothesis </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a strong,</v>

55
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:30.310
<v Speaker 1>big five hypothesis.</v>

56
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.173
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The week big five hypothesis is that in </v>

57
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:37.900
<v Speaker 1>so far as you use language to describe </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>

58
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:41.950
<v Speaker 1>personality has a five factor structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's reliably extractable.</v>

59
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.111
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the strong,</v>

60
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:44.944
<v Speaker 1>Big Five theory is that no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no personality has a fight factor </v>

61
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 1>structure and it's accurately </v>
<v Speaker 1>represented in language.</v>

62
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:52.810
<v Speaker 1>But when you pull out the structure from</v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

63
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:57.610
<v Speaker 1>what you're pulling out is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>representative of genuine personality.</v>

64
00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:59.583
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the week hypothesis is I would say it's </v>

65
00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:06.520
<v Speaker 1>established and it's worth knowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because what it,</v>

66
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.833
<v Speaker 1>what it means is that if you invent a </v>
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire that has anything to do </v>

67
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:14.140
<v Speaker 1>with self description,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be self description at multiple</v>

68
00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:16.480
<v Speaker 1>different levels of analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

69
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.493
<v Speaker 1>like values for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And instead of just adjectives or </v>

70
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.023
<v Speaker 1>attitudes instead of just adjectives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean these categories are sort of of </v>

71
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unclear.</v>

72
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.270
<v Speaker 1>What's the difference between your </v>
<v Speaker 1>attitude and your temperament?</v>

73
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.113
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.750
<v Speaker 1>it's usually defined by the sentence </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you use the words in,</v>

75
00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:36.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You extract out the words,</v>

76
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.230
<v Speaker 1>they sort of stand there alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

77
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.270
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to clarify their </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>

78
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.360
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lexical hypothesis I think is one of</v>

79
00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:47.194
<v Speaker 1>the most well established.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most well validated </v>

80
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:52.594
<v Speaker 1>claims in psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it might be the most validated </v>

81
00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:56.374
<v Speaker 1>claim apart from maybe the work that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>extracted Iq out from cognitive </v>

82
00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:02.830
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

83
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.360
<v Speaker 1>basically it was brute force statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

84
00:05:07.361 --> 00:05:08.194
<v Speaker 1>people develop different lists of </v>
<v Speaker 1>adjectives and you can complain in some </v>

85
00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:14.110
<v Speaker 1>ways about how they did it and we'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about that later.</v>

86
00:05:14.111 --> 00:05:17.530
<v Speaker 1>But because they tried to throw out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evaluative words,</v>

87
00:05:17.531 --> 00:05:19.180
<v Speaker 1>like good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

88
00:05:19.181 --> 00:05:21.530
<v Speaker 1>those aren't in the big five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

89
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:22.653
<v Speaker 1>so they tried to only use adjectives </v>
<v Speaker 1>that didn't necessarily seem to be like </v>

90
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.300
<v Speaker 1>highly or like valued or devalued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So introvert and extrovert,</v>

91
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.790
<v Speaker 1>while they're opposites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

92
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.360
<v Speaker 1>is it better to be an introvert?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better to be the extroverts like,</v>

93
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not obvious.</v>

94
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:39.483
<v Speaker 1>So those were all the words that cover </v>
<v Speaker 1>that dimension can be kept in because </v>

95
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.410
<v Speaker 1>there's no value judgements associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

96
00:05:45.411 --> 00:05:46.244
<v Speaker 1>And the originators of the big five </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory wanted to keep it as free of </v>

97
00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:53.050
<v Speaker 1>values as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's already a hypothesis,</v>

98
00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:53.884
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a hypothesis that you can come up </v>

99
00:05:55.061 --> 00:05:57.340
<v Speaker 1>with an accurate description of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>

100
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.503
<v Speaker 1>even if you eliminate all the words that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to do that are clearly valence </v>

101
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:03.110
<v Speaker 1>east.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

102
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:03.944
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did an experiment here a while back </v>

103
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:07.990
<v Speaker 1>that was pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

104
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.193
<v Speaker 1>we got hold of our data set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>descriptive adjectives and we put all </v>

105
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:14.090
<v Speaker 1>the evaluative words back in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

106
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.193
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like nasty and horrible and awkward and </v>

107
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cruel.</v>

108
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:20.220
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

109
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.490
<v Speaker 1>and then the good words as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

110
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.780
<v Speaker 1>moral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasant,</v>

111
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.370
<v Speaker 1>uplifting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those things.</v>

112
00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:28.280
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we had people rate people they liked</v>

113
00:06:28.281 --> 00:06:31.310
<v Speaker 1>and people they didn't like using that </v>
<v Speaker 1>expanded list.</v>

114
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.540
<v Speaker 1>And we got a real archetype in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of the hateable person.</v>

115
00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:36.374
<v Speaker 1>And a tremendous number of the words </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were used came from the evaluative </v>

116
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:40.303
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that when you throw out the </v>

117
00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:42.794
<v Speaker 1>evaluative words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually throw out a lot of what </v>

118
00:06:44.961 --> 00:06:48.170
<v Speaker 1>people actually use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Descriptive words to describe.</v>

119
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.033
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you like someone or don't like </v>

120
00:06:50.091 --> 00:06:53.000
<v Speaker 1>someone if someone's likable or </v>
<v Speaker 1>unlikable,</v>

121
00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:56.520
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty important phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

122
00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.093
<v Speaker 1>You hang around the people you like </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking and you don't </v>

123
00:06:59.841 --> 00:07:01.460
<v Speaker 1>associate with the people you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

124
00:07:01.461 --> 00:07:06.140
<v Speaker 1>So it's a fundamental choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we all talk about that later because</v>

125
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.153
<v Speaker 1>there's reasons that happened and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons were valid and it's not that </v>

126
00:07:10.821 --> 00:07:13.220
<v Speaker 1>easy to fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And besides that,</v>

127
00:07:13.221 --> 00:07:15.890
<v Speaker 1>the standard five factor model has all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of utility.</v>

128
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:17.263
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you need to know what its strengths </v>

129
00:07:18.141 --> 00:07:19.370
<v Speaker 1>are and its limitations are.</v>

130
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:21.043
<v Speaker 1>Now hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you knew to draw out the five </v>

131
00:07:23.541 --> 00:07:24.374
<v Speaker 1>factor model is you take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine the sec of all descriptive </v>

132
00:07:26.721 --> 00:07:27.890
<v Speaker 1>adjectives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

133
00:07:27.891 --> 00:07:28.724
<v Speaker 1>And then you take a random sample of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those descriptive adjectives so that </v>

134
00:07:33.171 --> 00:07:34.004
<v Speaker 1>it's not biased.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to use all of them </v>

135
00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:36.854
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you ask someone to describe </v>

136
00:07:38.181 --> 00:07:39.014
<v Speaker 1>themselves on a questionnaire using all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the adjectives we have that describe </v>

137
00:07:42.141 --> 00:07:44.480
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be there for like a day.</v>

138
00:07:44.481 --> 00:07:47.570
<v Speaker 1>And so that's not very efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you want to take a random sample,</v>

139
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.620
<v Speaker 1>maybe you only sample the words that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are most likely to use.</v>

140
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.510
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go online,</v>

141
00:07:53.511 --> 00:07:55.880
<v Speaker 1>you'll find that there are word </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequency tables,</v>

142
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most of your language,</v>

143
00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:03.080
<v Speaker 1>most of the about 500 words covers about</v>
<v Speaker 1>80% of what you say.</v>

144
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:07.400
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't remember what the lexicon of</v>

145
00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:08.750
<v Speaker 1>the typical person is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

146
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.830
<v Speaker 1>I think it's in the neighborhood of </v>
<v Speaker 1>3,500 words,</v>

147
00:08:12.831 --> 00:08:13.664
<v Speaker 1>but that might be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's like 750,000 words in the </v>

148
00:08:16.671 --> 00:08:17.760
<v Speaker 1>English language know.</v>

149
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:21.050
<v Speaker 1>It's an omnivorous language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just pulled words in from all over.</v>

150
00:08:21.051 --> 00:08:23.720
<v Speaker 1>And so you hardly use any of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>

151
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:24.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's ones that are used </v>

152
00:08:26.331 --> 00:08:27.164
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily in frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you could do is you could look </v>

153
00:08:30.531 --> 00:08:33.320
<v Speaker 1>at the total set of adjectives and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could pull out,</v>

154
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>identify the ones,</v>

155
00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.830
<v Speaker 1>the ones that are used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

156
00:08:36.831 --> 00:08:37.664
<v Speaker 1>the thousand most frequently used words </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that probably cover 95% of the </v>

157
00:08:40.971 --> 00:08:41.804
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you could pick out random set </v>

158
00:08:43.881 --> 00:08:47.120
<v Speaker 1>of a hundred and you could administer it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to people and then you can factor it,</v>

159
00:08:47.121 --> 00:08:49.700
<v Speaker 1>analyze it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you administered it to lots of people,</v>

160
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:50.623
<v Speaker 1>then you factor analyze it and you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>five relatively clear and stable </v>

161
00:08:53.841 --> 00:08:55.500
<v Speaker 1>factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the most,</v>

162
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.620
<v Speaker 1>the one that comes out first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

163
00:08:58.621 --> 00:08:59.454
<v Speaker 1>it's the dominant factor in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the easiest to measure are maybe the </v>

164
00:09:02.731 --> 00:09:04.860
<v Speaker 1>best representative language or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

165
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:05.693
<v Speaker 1>It's extroversion versus introversion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And extroversion is a positive emotion </v>

166
00:09:11.371 --> 00:09:12.204
<v Speaker 1>dimension and it's associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>enthusiasm and assertiveness and </v>

167
00:09:20.221 --> 00:09:21.054
<v Speaker 1>assertive people will say they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominate the conversation with language </v>

168
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.260
<v Speaker 1>or they'll while back basically that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the right way to think about it.</v>

169
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:31.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm enthusiastic people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're up for anything.</v>

170
00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:32.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the ones that are always smiling</v>

171
00:09:32.971 --> 00:09:35.100
<v Speaker 1>and telling jokes and having parties and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing.</v>

172
00:09:35.101 --> 00:09:37.800
<v Speaker 1>And generally extroverts really liked to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be around people,</v>

173
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.230
<v Speaker 1>so they're happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're gregarious,</v>

174
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.540
<v Speaker 1>they're assertive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're enthusiastic,</v>

175
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.630
<v Speaker 1>they're noisy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they blink bore than introverts.</v>

176
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.160
<v Speaker 1>Now why that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

177
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:48.023
<v Speaker 1>But apparently they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you notice something blinking a </v>

178
00:09:50.581 --> 00:09:52.470
<v Speaker 1>lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can assume that they're extroverts.</v>

179
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:56.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're not conscientious,</v>

180
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.863
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this idea of people being </v>

181
00:09:59.161 --> 00:10:01.260
<v Speaker 1>impulsive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very badly defined terms.</v>

182
00:10:01.261 --> 00:10:03.630
<v Speaker 1>So when you hear a psychologist talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about impulsivity,</v>

183
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.150
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you could realize is </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know.</v>

184
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:07.403
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what the hell they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about because probably there's </v>

185
00:10:09.061 --> 00:10:09.894
<v Speaker 1>no such thing as impulsivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But extroverted people who are not very </v>

186
00:10:14.611 --> 00:10:15.444
<v Speaker 1>conscientious tend to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things that you might </v>

187
00:10:19.471 --> 00:10:21.660
<v Speaker 1>think about as associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulsivity.</v>

188
00:10:21.661 --> 00:10:23.220
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of other things though</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

189
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.540
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

190
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:25.913
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a positive emotion dimension </v>

191
00:10:27.061 --> 00:10:29.160
<v Speaker 1>and that's extroversion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's negative emotion,</v>

192
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:30.121
<v Speaker 1>emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimension,</v>

193
00:10:30.121 --> 00:10:30.954
<v Speaker 1>and that's neuroticism and neurotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neuroticism seems to break down into </v>

194
00:10:34.561 --> 00:10:38.310
<v Speaker 1>something like withdrawal and volatility</v>
<v Speaker 1>and volatile people are touching.</v>

195
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:39.713
<v Speaker 1>So you know they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll react quite a lot if something </v>

196
00:10:42.121 --> 00:10:42.954
<v Speaker 1>negative happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you've teased it and they might </v>

197
00:10:43.951 --> 00:10:44.784
<v Speaker 1>get upset or if you start fighting with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and that sort of provocative way </v>

198
00:10:47.791 --> 00:10:49.860
<v Speaker 1>instead of sort of calming everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

199
00:10:49.861 --> 00:10:50.694
<v Speaker 1>they will just ramp it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if there's two of you that are </v>

200
00:10:52.651 --> 00:10:56.070
<v Speaker 1>volatile and you're having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation and the conversation goes a</v>

201
00:10:56.071 --> 00:10:56.940
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

202
00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.090
<v Speaker 1>into unpleasant territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can really get each other going.</v>

203
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.553
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in term of south beach and I can </v>

204
00:11:04.741 --> 00:11:06.740
<v Speaker 1>turn those days both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

205
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:07.763
<v Speaker 1>both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

206
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:12.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's part of the problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>using the word emotion because you know,</v>

207
00:11:12.121 --> 00:11:14.580
<v Speaker 1>is an emotion and internal state or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>set of behaviors.</v>

208
00:11:14.581 --> 00:11:16.470
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is as far as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can tell,</v>

209
00:11:16.471 --> 00:11:19.380
<v Speaker 1>it's both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now</v>

210
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>extroversion and neuroticism.</v>

211
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:25.583
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason for that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think the evidence for the </v>

212
00:11:28.861 --> 00:11:33.030
<v Speaker 1>relationship between those traits and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the brain functions functions is</v>

213
00:11:33.031 --> 00:11:33.864
<v Speaker 1>in some sense the clearest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you remember the baby five were </v>

214
00:11:37.231 --> 00:11:39.630
<v Speaker 1>extracted out using statistical </v>
<v Speaker 1>procedures,</v>

215
00:11:39.631 --> 00:11:40.464
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no reason to assume </v>

216
00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:42.534
<v Speaker 1>necessarily that the traits would bear </v>
<v Speaker 1>any straight forward relationship to </v>

217
00:11:46.321 --> 00:11:47.154
<v Speaker 1>brain function because they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't derived from analysis of </v>

218
00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:54.140
<v Speaker 1>brain function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least not directly they were at,</v>

219
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.353
<v Speaker 1>they were extracted from analysis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>linguistic representations of other </v>

220
00:11:58.781 --> 00:12:00.340
<v Speaker 1>peoples and your own behavior.</v>

221
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:01.623
<v Speaker 1>But it turns out that there's quite a </v>
<v Speaker 1>concordance between certain elements of </v>

222
00:12:05.621 --> 00:12:10.621
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychological theory and deposit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Edom and negative emotional traits,</v>

223
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:15.040
<v Speaker 1>extroversion and neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what I'm going to do today is I'm</v>

224
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:16.510
<v Speaker 1>gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna,</v>

225
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:20.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk to you about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive and negative emotion are,</v>

226
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.700
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

227
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:25.360
<v Speaker 1>instantiated in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurologically.</v>

228
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:27.123
<v Speaker 1>But I'm going to put that in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a broader picture of brain function </v>

229
00:12:30.611 --> 00:12:32.220
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

230
00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:33.850
<v Speaker 1>because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>

231
00:12:33.851 --> 00:12:35.830
<v Speaker 1>And second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of the things I'm going to</v>

232
00:12:35.831 --> 00:12:36.664
<v Speaker 1>tell you about the brain today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll sort of retroactively shed light </v>

233
00:12:39.581 --> 00:12:42.400
<v Speaker 1>on some of the clinical theories that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've already talked about.</v>

234
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.920
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so which is nice,</v>

235
00:12:44.921 --> 00:12:45.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when it,</v>

236
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.490
<v Speaker 1>one of the ways that you find out if </v>
<v Speaker 1>something is true,</v>

237
00:12:48.491 --> 00:12:51.100
<v Speaker 1>and this is something we also talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about during the last lecture,</v>

238
00:12:51.101 --> 00:12:51.934
<v Speaker 1>is that it manifests itself even when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you use different measurement </v>

239
00:12:56.591 --> 00:12:57.160
<v Speaker 1>techniques.</v>

240
00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.650
<v Speaker 1>And so he had this statistical </v>
<v Speaker 1>derivation,</v>

241
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:01.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which basically took place.</v>

242
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:02.703
<v Speaker 1>It really started to accelerate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say first in the 1960s and then </v>

243
00:13:06.011 --> 00:13:06.844
<v Speaker 1>in the 1980s it made a big comeback in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 1980s but paralleling not were </v>

244
00:13:10.121 --> 00:13:10.954
<v Speaker 1>theories of brain development and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't really that the scientists that </v>

245
00:13:14.381 --> 00:13:15.214
<v Speaker 1>were doing the one sort of research </v>
<v Speaker 1>really work communicating with the </v>

246
00:13:17.081 --> 00:13:18.970
<v Speaker 1>scientists that were doing the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of research.</v>

247
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.600
<v Speaker 1>So they were methodologically separate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use different techniques as well,</v>

248
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:23.583
<v Speaker 1>but they weren't talking back and forth </v>
<v Speaker 1>much and they were using different </v>

249
00:13:26.561 --> 00:13:27.394
<v Speaker 1>measurement techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if they both come up with the same </v>

250
00:13:29.291 --> 00:13:30.710
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you think,</v>

251
00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:35.560
<v Speaker 1>oh well there's probably something to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because you know the sighted people</v>

252
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:38.110
<v Speaker 1>discovered that down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who could hear discovered it.</v>

253
00:13:38.111 --> 00:13:39.640
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same kind of idea.</v>

254
00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:42.430
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

255
00:13:42.431 --> 00:13:46.480
<v Speaker 1>this has been worked out in a fair bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of detail over the last</v>

256
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.480
<v Speaker 1>30 years really.</v>

257
00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.890
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

258
00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:54.243
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the papers that you're supposed to read </v>

259
00:13:54.971 --> 00:13:56.410
<v Speaker 1>with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're difficult papers.</v>

260
00:13:56.411 --> 00:13:58.090
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe you're reading gray,</v>

261
00:13:58.091 --> 00:13:58.924
<v Speaker 1>which is a model of the limbic system </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Basal Ganglia applications to </v>

262
00:14:01.931 --> 00:14:04.630
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

263
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you have goals and behavior.</v>

264
00:14:06.941 --> 00:14:11.860
<v Speaker 1>That's the Carbon Shire paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put the Swanson paper in as optional.</v>

265
00:14:11.861 --> 00:14:14.470
<v Speaker 1>That's cerebral hemisphere regulation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated behavior.</v>

266
00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:15.483
<v Speaker 1>That is a tough paper and so is the gray</v>
<v Speaker 1>paper and it's part of it because of </v>

267
00:14:19.141 --> 00:14:19.974
<v Speaker 1>these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of them graze paper is that is a </v>

268
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:27.340
<v Speaker 1>distillation of a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very thick book that's very,</v>

269
00:14:27.341 --> 00:14:29.320
<v Speaker 1>very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's been written twice.</v>

270
00:14:29.321 --> 00:14:32.290
<v Speaker 1>It was published first in 1982 and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>again in 1999.</v>

271
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:33.423
<v Speaker 1>It's a brilliant book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's had a tremendous impact on </v>

272
00:14:35.861 --> 00:14:36.694
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gray was one of those people who he was </v>

273
00:14:38.981 --> 00:14:40.750
<v Speaker 1>so damn smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just painful.</v>

274
00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:41.613
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

275
00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.453
<v Speaker 1>His reference list,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many papers are in his </v>

276
00:14:44.291 --> 00:14:45.124
<v Speaker 1>reference lists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 2001 of the really weird things </v>

277
00:14:47.441 --> 00:14:48.274
<v Speaker 1>about gray that makes him stand out </v>
<v Speaker 1>among scientist is he actually read all </v>

278
00:14:50.651 --> 00:14:54.200
<v Speaker 1>those papers and more than that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>understood them.</v>

279
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:58.370
<v Speaker 1>And so that's really something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so gray's book on anxiety,</v>

280
00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

281
00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:00.903
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did a lot of work with animal </v>

282
00:15:02.361 --> 00:15:03.194
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you if you want like solid </v>

283
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:09.200
<v Speaker 1>psychological information about how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain works,</v>

284
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:11.690
<v Speaker 1>the people you pay attention to are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal,</v>

285
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:13.263
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who are studying animal </v>

286
00:15:13.911 --> 00:15:17.840
<v Speaker 1>behavior and animal grades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know what they're doing there.</v>

287
00:15:17.841 --> 00:15:19.970
<v Speaker 1>So methodologically careful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very,</v>

288
00:15:19.971 --> 00:15:20.804
<v Speaker 1>very reliable and the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychologists and the people who </v>

289
00:15:23.451 --> 00:15:25.490
<v Speaker 1>use pet scanners and Mris and all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

290
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:26.810
<v Speaker 1>there are way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

291
00:15:26.811 --> 00:15:27.644
<v Speaker 1>way behind the animal researchers </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the animal researchers can just </v>

292
00:15:30.411 --> 00:15:31.244
<v Speaker 1>get in there at a lot higher resolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can do much more stringent </v>

293
00:15:34.161 --> 00:15:37.350
<v Speaker 1>experiments and they tend to be more </v>
<v Speaker 1>methodological,</v>

294
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:39.440
<v Speaker 1>careful and more scientifically minded.</v>

295
00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:42.350
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grade book is a brilliant book.</v>

296
00:15:42.351 --> 00:15:44.750
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took me like four months to read that</v>

297
00:15:44.751 --> 00:15:49.460
<v Speaker 1>damn book and I mean I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really had to take it apart because he</v>

298
00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.800
<v Speaker 1>probably poured 30 years of work into </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

299
00:15:51.801 --> 00:15:56.150
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like he worked a lot in 30 years.</v>

300
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.073
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did a lot of experimentation and he </v>

301
00:15:57.981 --> 00:15:59.870
<v Speaker 1>read a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he built a bottle of the,</v>

302
00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.510
<v Speaker 1>of the brain's function that was based </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

303
00:16:02.511 --> 00:16:06.260
<v Speaker 1>partly on Russian neuropsychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly on cybernetic theory,</v>

304
00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:11.090
<v Speaker 1>hardly on animal behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly on neuropsychopharmacology.</v>

305
00:16:11.091 --> 00:16:11.924
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the study of how drugs </v>
<v Speaker 1>affect behavior and cognition and then </v>

306
00:16:15.531 --> 00:16:19.790
<v Speaker 1>partly partly from a higher order </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptual perspective.</v>

307
00:16:19.791 --> 00:16:20.624
<v Speaker 1>And then he stacked all those things up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one on top of the other to make sure </v>

308
00:16:22.911 --> 00:16:26.540
<v Speaker 1>that the picture was the same at every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single level of analysis.</v>

309
00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:27.373
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where can it took the social </v>

310
00:16:29.631 --> 00:16:32.210
<v Speaker 1>psychologists?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they already started thinking about</v>

311
00:16:32.211 --> 00:16:33.044
<v Speaker 1>gray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although he published his book in 1982 </v>

312
00:16:34.791 --> 00:16:36.530
<v Speaker 1>they probably started thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

313
00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:37.453
<v Speaker 1>seriously in about 2005 so it took 23 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years for his book to start to make its </v>

314
00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:47.120
<v Speaker 1>widescale entrance into the more general</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological community.</v>

315
00:16:47.121 --> 00:16:51.110
<v Speaker 1>And anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you're going to read this paper,</v>

316
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:54.020
<v Speaker 1>which is a model of the limbic system </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Basal Ganglia.</v>

317
00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:55.213
<v Speaker 1>And it's a distillate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 30 years were distilled into the </v>

318
00:16:57.171 --> 00:16:59.120
<v Speaker 1>book and then that was distilled into </v>
<v Speaker 1>this paper.</v>

319
00:16:59.121 --> 00:17:01.520
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's rough going.</v>

320
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:04.700
<v Speaker 1>And then the Swanson paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's another guy,</v>

321
00:17:04.701 --> 00:17:07.370
<v Speaker 1>same kind of guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a developmental neuro anatomist.</v>

322
00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:10.910
<v Speaker 1>And if you're really interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology,</v>

323
00:17:10.911 --> 00:17:14.990
<v Speaker 1>I would really recommend reading those </v>
<v Speaker 1>papers because like they're hard going.</v>

324
00:17:14.991 --> 00:17:16.710
<v Speaker 1>But if you get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

325
00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.960
<v Speaker 1>you have this substrata of knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath you that's really from,</v>

326
00:17:20.961 --> 00:17:24.090
<v Speaker 1>and I rated like Swanson's paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy's a genius.</v>

327
00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:24.923
<v Speaker 1>And what's so cool about Swanson's paper</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you talk to human </v>

328
00:17:28.341 --> 00:17:29.174
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll find that their bias towards the </v>

329
00:17:31.521 --> 00:17:33.860
<v Speaker 1>cerebral cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's sort of,</v>

330
00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:34.753
<v Speaker 1>I think there's sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>anthropomorphic pride that goes along </v>

331
00:17:36.981 --> 00:17:37.671
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

332
00:17:37.671 --> 00:17:39.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are we different from animals?</v>

333
00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:39.771
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

334
00:17:39.771 --> 00:17:41.570
<v Speaker 1>we've got thumbs and nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

335
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:43.760
<v Speaker 1>hooray for the thumbs and we stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

336
00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:44.953
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at us neurologically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big differences that we have this </v>

337
00:17:47.121 --> 00:17:51.180
<v Speaker 1>tremendously expanded cerebral cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the prefrontal cortex.</v>

338
00:17:51.181 --> 00:17:53.100
<v Speaker 1>And so then people think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

339
00:17:53.101 --> 00:17:53.934
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things that </v>

340
00:17:55.201 --> 00:18:00.201
<v Speaker 1>differentiates from animals and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively evolutionarily modern because</v>

341
00:18:00.511 --> 00:18:04.170
<v Speaker 1>the human brain really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really developed rapidly over the last 2</v>

342
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:08.250
<v Speaker 1>million years that it's like king of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain in some sense.</v>

343
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.950
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the place where all the complicated</v>

344
00:18:10.951 --> 00:18:13.620
<v Speaker 1>things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's just not right.</v>

345
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Because like breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's complicated.</v>

346
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:17.663
<v Speaker 1>That's why you don't get to control it </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily and keeping your heart </v>

347
00:18:20.461 --> 00:18:22.590
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's complicated too.</v>

348
00:18:22.591 --> 00:18:24.720
<v Speaker 1>And so you don't get to have a decision </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

349
00:18:24.721 --> 00:18:25.554
<v Speaker 1>Your brain has made that automatic like </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of years ago because there's </v>

350
00:18:29.941 --> 00:18:30.774
<v Speaker 1>just no way you're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntary control over something that's </v>

351
00:18:32.851 --> 00:18:34.630
<v Speaker 1>that vital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

352
00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.473
<v Speaker 1>So assuming that newer brain areas do </v>
<v Speaker 1>more complex things is in some ways I </v>

353
00:18:40.621 --> 00:18:42.750
<v Speaker 1>think that's actually precisely </v>
<v Speaker 1>backwards.</v>

354
00:18:42.751 --> 00:18:45.390
<v Speaker 1>It's the old brain areas that have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>around for,</v>

355
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred a hundred million years.</v>

356
00:18:47.941 --> 00:18:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Those damn things are smart and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>why they've survived for so long and why</v>

357
00:18:52.711 --> 00:18:55.170
<v Speaker 1>they're distributed and into so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>different species.</v>

358
00:18:55.171 --> 00:18:56.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

359
00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.490
<v Speaker 1>your brain is somewhat like a lobster's </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

360
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.473
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot like a mouse brain and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot like a rat brain and you might </v>

361
00:19:03.931 --> 00:19:04.321
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

362
00:19:04.321 --> 00:19:07.680
<v Speaker 1>the rapper and isn't a very good model </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a human brain because after all their</v>

363
00:19:07.681 --> 00:19:08.514
<v Speaker 1>rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one thing I can tell you is that a </v>

364
00:19:10.291 --> 00:19:13.080
<v Speaker 1>rat brain is a way better model of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>human brain.</v>

365
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.830
<v Speaker 1>Then your model of a human brain is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>model of the human brain.</v>

366
00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:17.993
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like people think of the brain </v>

367
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:23.910
<v Speaker 1>while they have a don't be modeled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Use a rack as an example.</v>

368
00:19:23.911 --> 00:19:24.744
<v Speaker 1>Of course it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's often some ways cause rats can't </v>

369
00:19:26.311 --> 00:19:30.540
<v Speaker 1>talk for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are so many levels of analysis</v>

370
00:19:30.541 --> 00:19:33.240
<v Speaker 1>where you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might as well be Iraq,</v>

371
00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:35.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technically speaking,</v>

372
00:19:35.311 --> 00:19:37.470
<v Speaker 1>the neuro pharmacology for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is very,</v>

373
00:19:37.471 --> 00:19:40.320
<v Speaker 1>very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The function of the neurotransmitters,</v>

374
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:41.303
<v Speaker 1>the basic anatomy of the structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a tremendous amount of of </v>

375
00:19:45.661 --> 00:19:46.494
<v Speaker 1>overlap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you might as well go for the </v>

376
00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:49.854
<v Speaker 1>commonalities among brains before you </v>
<v Speaker 1>focusing on the differences because in </v>

377
00:19:53.041 --> 00:19:56.400
<v Speaker 1>some sense that way you get the basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>architecture right now.</v>

378
00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.130
<v Speaker 1>Now one of the things that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about Swanson,</v>

379
00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:00.293
<v Speaker 1>and this makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's not a neuropsychologist and </v>

380
00:20:02.851 --> 00:20:04.620
<v Speaker 1>he's not really even a psychologist.</v>

381
00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:06.203
<v Speaker 1>He's a developmental neuro anatomist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's lots of ways of piecing </v>

382
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:11.930
<v Speaker 1>of chopping up the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

383
00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.310
<v Speaker 1>to look at it because it's a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated thing.</v>

384
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:15.263
<v Speaker 1>It's like saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how many ways can you divide up a </v>

385
00:20:16.561 --> 00:20:18.810
<v Speaker 1>city to analyze it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

386
00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:22.920
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's endless numbers of ways that you</v>

387
00:20:22.921 --> 00:20:25.200
<v Speaker 1>can divide up a city to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>

388
00:20:25.201 --> 00:20:26.760
<v Speaker 1>it's the same with the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

389
00:20:26.761 --> 00:20:27.594
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's infinitely sub dividable in some </v>

390
00:20:30.451 --> 00:20:31.284
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly all the way down to the </v>

391
00:20:31.861 --> 00:20:35.490
<v Speaker 1>molecular structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then even at higher order levels,</v>

392
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:36.593
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's so complex and it's </v>

393
00:20:37.861 --> 00:20:38.694
<v Speaker 1>hierarchically structured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just divide it up in all sorts </v>

394
00:20:41.011 --> 00:20:44.880
<v Speaker 1>of different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so at higher levels of resolution,</v>

395
00:20:44.881 --> 00:20:47.160
<v Speaker 1>there isn't even that much agreement on </v>
<v Speaker 1>how the name,</v>

396
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:48.003
<v Speaker 1>the parts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what the developmental neuro </v>

397
00:20:50.251 --> 00:20:54.580
<v Speaker 1>anatomist do is that they look at how </v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain develops in utero over time.</v>

398
00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:55.413
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause it's a developing thing that sort </v>

399
00:20:56.531 --> 00:20:59.130
<v Speaker 1>of unfolds like a flower unfolds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

400
00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.430
<v Speaker 1>and you can track how the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

401
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.020
<v Speaker 1>which part of the early brain turns into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the later brain.</v>

402
00:21:05.021 --> 00:21:08.500
<v Speaker 1>And so you can get some sense of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

403
00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:10.690
<v Speaker 1>it's like an evolutionary tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

404
00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:13.330
<v Speaker 1>if these three parts grew out of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>part,</v>

405
00:21:13.331 --> 00:21:16.150
<v Speaker 1>then you can assume that there's some </v>
<v Speaker 1>commonality between them.</v>

406
00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.820
<v Speaker 1>And that can also help you figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to divide up the brain.</v>

407
00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:21.160
<v Speaker 1>And so that's one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Swanson does.</v>

408
00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.560
<v Speaker 1>But the other thing he does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I really liked,</v>

409
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:27.160
<v Speaker 1>is that instead of looking at the brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the top down,</v>

410
00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:27.994
<v Speaker 1>which is what human neuropsychologists </v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to do because they concentrate on </v>

411
00:21:30.581 --> 00:21:34.540
<v Speaker 1>say language and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher order cognitive functions,</v>

412
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:35.793
<v Speaker 1>which we think of as complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you think they're not that damn </v>

413
00:21:37.661 --> 00:21:38.320
<v Speaker 1>complex.</v>

414
00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.153
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a computer can can do mathematics </v>

415
00:21:41.591 --> 00:21:44.320
<v Speaker 1>so much better than you that there's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>even any comparison.</v>

416
00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it won't be very long before.</v>

417
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:47.793
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we think of as abstract cognition </v>

418
00:21:50.651 --> 00:21:52.390
<v Speaker 1>are things that computers are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to do,</v>

419
00:21:52.391 --> 00:21:53.224
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just want to go tournament for </v>

420
00:21:54.311 --> 00:21:57.160
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the computers are now better.</v>

421
00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Even your pc is better at playing chess </v>
<v Speaker 1>than probably anyone in this room.</v>

422
00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:05.100
<v Speaker 1>And the really high end computers are </v>
<v Speaker 1>better at playing chess that anyone who,</v>

423
00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.410
<v Speaker 1>who lives and so computers are catching </v>
<v Speaker 1>up damn fast,</v>

424
00:22:08.411 --> 00:22:09.244
<v Speaker 1>but you'll notice that they don't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like bus tables in restaurants </v>

425
00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:14.860
<v Speaker 1>because it turns out that's really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

426
00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:16.540
<v Speaker 1>when you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>

427
00:22:16.541 --> 00:22:18.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're carrying different size loads all</v>

428
00:22:18.431 --> 00:22:19.264
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to interact socially with </v>

429
00:22:21.131 --> 00:22:21.970
<v Speaker 1>people properly.</v>

430
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.830
<v Speaker 1>You have to stay the hell out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

431
00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.950
<v Speaker 1>You have to exactly time when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to come to the table,</v>

432
00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:28.323
<v Speaker 1>you know you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to move extraordinarily </v>

433
00:22:30.131 --> 00:22:32.350
<v Speaker 1>efficiently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially as the place gets busy.</v>

434
00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:33.453
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of demands on you to do </v>

435
00:22:34.991 --> 00:22:36.490
<v Speaker 1>that job effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

436
00:22:36.491 --> 00:22:40.300
<v Speaker 1>we think about it as a low end job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not automated.</v>

437
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:44.260
<v Speaker 1>The low end jobs are the ones that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be automated first.</v>

438
00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:47.980
<v Speaker 1>And it's not obvious that they're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the things that we associated with</v>

439
00:22:47.981 --> 00:22:49.570
<v Speaker 1>low end labor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

440
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:50.673
<v Speaker 1>it's just the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well now like Swanson did with the </v>

441
00:22:53.651 --> 00:22:55.290
<v Speaker 1>nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lost,</v>

442
00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:56.163
<v Speaker 1>I was so happy when I found this paper </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he did exactly with the nervous </v>

443
00:22:59.141 --> 00:22:59.974
<v Speaker 1>system what piaget did with children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He showed how the nervous system builds </v>

444
00:23:04.001 --> 00:23:05.470
<v Speaker 1>itself from the bottom up.</v>

445
00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:09.100
<v Speaker 1>And so Swanson lays right on top of </v>
<v Speaker 1>piaget.</v>

446
00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.053
<v Speaker 1>It's lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing that Swanson </v>

447
00:23:12.401 --> 00:23:13.234
<v Speaker 1>does very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very nicely as he elucidates a lot of </v>

448
00:23:15.551 --> 00:23:18.130
<v Speaker 1>the Friday and presuppositions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

449
00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:22.090
<v Speaker 1>so Freud of course talk about the Ed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ed is this,</v>

450
00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.940
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like the archaic brain in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense.</v>

451
00:23:24.941 --> 00:23:25.774
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all where all your primal impulses </v>

452
00:23:27.281 --> 00:23:28.114
<v Speaker 1>lurk and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he called that one thing that in while </v>

453
00:23:31.571 --> 00:23:32.210
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

454
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:34.390
<v Speaker 1>is there an IED in the brain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>

455
00:23:34.391 --> 00:23:39.130
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vaguely,</v>

456
00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:41.330
<v Speaker 1>vaguely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

457
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:46.020
<v Speaker 1>the brain does differ in terms of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the age of it's sub components.</v>

458
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:49.520
<v Speaker 1>And as you go deeper into the brain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>closer to the spine,</v>

459
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:50.773
<v Speaker 1>the brain areas get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find a genetically older and the more </v>

460
00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:55.220
<v Speaker 1>Fila,</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetically older areas of the brain,</v>

461
00:23:55.221 --> 00:23:58.700
<v Speaker 1>which are underneath the Cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have their own little circuits,</v>

462
00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.113
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's some commonality between </v>

463
00:24:01.641 --> 00:24:01.790
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

464
00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:02.623
<v Speaker 1>And they do govern primal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of them as primal </v>

465
00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.130
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

466
00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:08.003
<v Speaker 1>I know we've talked about that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better than thinking about them as </v>

467
00:24:10.191 --> 00:24:14.210
<v Speaker 1>drives or goals or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because not only do they,</v>

468
00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:16.540
<v Speaker 1>do they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

469
00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:18.050
<v Speaker 1>do they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

470
00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:20.300
<v Speaker 1>they're like sets of associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors,</v>

471
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:21.223
<v Speaker 1>but they're not just that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are also ways of looking at the </v>

472
00:24:23.001 --> 00:24:25.700
<v Speaker 1>world and ways of thinking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

473
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:28.070
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're angry,</v>

474
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:31.880
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're being driven to use your fists.</v>

475
00:24:31.881 --> 00:24:32.714
<v Speaker 1>That's not how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is that the angry </v>

476
00:24:34.641 --> 00:24:36.800
<v Speaker 1>subpersonality comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

477
00:24:36.801 --> 00:24:39.050
<v Speaker 1>and it does a whole bunch of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

478
00:24:39.051 --> 00:24:39.884
<v Speaker 1>it's got its own state of arousal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's characterized both by positive and </v>

479
00:24:43.221 --> 00:24:45.680
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something that's quite peculiar</v>

480
00:24:45.681 --> 00:24:46.514
<v Speaker 1>about anger because it's both a </v>
<v Speaker 1>defensive reaction and an aggressive </v>

481
00:24:49.851 --> 00:24:51.710
<v Speaker 1>forward moving behavior.</v>

482
00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.620
<v Speaker 1>And it has a viewpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's a biased viewpoint.</v>

483
00:24:54.621 --> 00:24:55.454
<v Speaker 1>If you're angry with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you can see about them is how damn </v>

484
00:24:57.831 --> 00:25:00.500
<v Speaker 1>irritating they are and how much they </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to be defeated,</v>

485
00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:01.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

486
00:25:01.821 --> 00:25:04.670
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a whole personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

487
00:25:04.671 --> 00:25:07.610
<v Speaker 1>It's a one dimensional personality cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>all it's really,</v>

488
00:25:07.611 --> 00:25:11.720
<v Speaker 1>God is anger and that's not enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>solve every problem.</v>

489
00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.780
<v Speaker 1>But you can't think about it as a drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

490
00:25:14.781 --> 00:25:16.880
<v Speaker 1>Because it's also because it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>deterministic.</v>

491
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:19.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's even when you're angry,</v>

492
00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.473
<v Speaker 1>you have a range of choices to make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there are circumscribed by the fact </v>

493
00:25:23.811 --> 00:25:25.460
<v Speaker 1>that you're angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

494
00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:28.940
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's best to think about it as a sub</v>

495
00:25:28.941 --> 00:25:29.774
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you just get a lot farther that </v>

496
00:25:31.161 --> 00:25:33.200
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what Swanson did,</v>

497
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:36.020
<v Speaker 1>you know how Piaget talked about </v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

498
00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:36.883
<v Speaker 1>infants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start out with a few fundamental </v>

499
00:25:38.451 --> 00:25:39.440
<v Speaker 1>reflexes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

500
00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.920
<v Speaker 1>That they're sort of born with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the ability to use their mouth</v>

501
00:25:42.921 --> 00:25:44.600
<v Speaker 1>and they're telling me as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploratory,</v>

502
00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:46.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>device,</v>

503
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:47.833
<v Speaker 1>and then they have certain reflexes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can manifest right away and then </v>

504
00:25:50.481 --> 00:25:53.150
<v Speaker 1>they have the ability to modify those </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflexes.</v>

505
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:56.960
<v Speaker 1>And so as far as piaget was concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was enough to get the ball rolling.</v>

506
00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.290
<v Speaker 1>It was sort of like the child was </v>
<v Speaker 1>booting up across time.</v>

507
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:01.430
<v Speaker 1>It's got some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

508
00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:02.593
<v Speaker 1>outside of the operating system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got some bare processes in your </v>

509
00:26:05.991 --> 00:26:09.620
<v Speaker 1>computer that get it started enough so </v>
<v Speaker 1>the operating system can turn on.</v>

510
00:26:09.621 --> 00:26:12.080
<v Speaker 1>It sort of unfolds up into something </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex.</v>

511
00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.153
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of what human beings do </v>

512
00:26:14.181 --> 00:26:17.060
<v Speaker 1>across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start out with these basic reflexes</v>

513
00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:18.553
<v Speaker 1>that are simple movements and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn how to modify the movements and </v>

514
00:26:20.961 --> 00:26:23.090
<v Speaker 1>then they learn how to chain the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movements together.</v>

515
00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:24.133
<v Speaker 1>And then they learn how to use the chain</v>
<v Speaker 1>movements as tools in some sense as </v>

516
00:26:28.071 --> 00:26:30.800
<v Speaker 1>embodied tools to pursue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

517
00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:36.250
<v Speaker 1>to allow these biologically determined </v>
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities to operate in the world</v>

518
00:26:36.621 --> 00:26:39.170
<v Speaker 1>with some chance of success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

519
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.033
<v Speaker 1>Now and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can layer that on to the nervous </v>

520
00:26:41.601 --> 00:26:43.650
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So partly what's happening when you get,</v>

521
00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:47.310
<v Speaker 1>when you get these basic movements down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that are now automatic,</v>

522
00:26:47.311 --> 00:26:50.010
<v Speaker 1>like your ability to grip the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your ability to,</v>

523
00:26:50.011 --> 00:26:52.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do this with your hands and all the,</v>

524
00:26:52.381 --> 00:26:54.870
<v Speaker 1>all the basic sub routines you have with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body.</v>

525
00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.273
<v Speaker 1>Those are automatized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're made into little machines and a </v>

526
00:26:58.261 --> 00:27:01.530
<v Speaker 1>lot of them run spinally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

527
00:27:01.531 --> 00:27:04.650
<v Speaker 1>because what you think in some sense is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you're walking,</v>

528
00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.690
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking about walking in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

529
00:27:06.691 --> 00:27:08.790
<v Speaker 1>that's how you walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's not right.</v>

530
00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:09.653
<v Speaker 1>What happens is you orient yourself to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a goal and in some sense you just </v>

531
00:27:13.381 --> 00:27:14.214
<v Speaker 1>disinhibit the system that knows how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>walk and then it more or less does it </v>

532
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:18.833
<v Speaker 1>automatically and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you direct it and you can modify what </v>

533
00:27:21.061 --> 00:27:23.940
<v Speaker 1>it's doing if there's an error,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you kind of know that,</v>

534
00:27:23.941 --> 00:27:24.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

535
00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.970
<v Speaker 1>You drive to to school and you drive </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere you're familiar to,</v>

536
00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:31.980
<v Speaker 1>you don't even even necessarily remember</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drive if you've done it 50 times.</v>

537
00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:32.933
<v Speaker 1>It's cause you're basically in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense you just sequencing automated </v>

538
00:27:36.931 --> 00:27:37.764
<v Speaker 1>behaviors and a good thing too because </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't have those automated </v>

539
00:27:41.071 --> 00:27:43.590
<v Speaker 1>expert behaviors at hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

540
00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.800
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't know how to drive because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

541
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:47.303
<v Speaker 1>you're just not smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the time when you drive most </v>

542
00:27:50.611 --> 00:27:52.800
<v Speaker 1>consciously is when you first learned </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to drive.</v>

543
00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:55.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want a conscious driver.</v>

544
00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:56.873
<v Speaker 1>You want an unconscious expert driver </v>
<v Speaker 1>whose consciousness is monitoring the </v>

545
00:28:00.361 --> 00:28:03.000
<v Speaker 1>world for anything unexpected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you want.</v>

546
00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.313
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the case for almost </v>

547
00:28:04.831 --> 00:28:05.664
<v Speaker 1>everything you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have to become conscious of what </v>

548
00:28:08.191 --> 00:28:09.024
<v Speaker 1>you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you don't do it </v>

549
00:28:10.201 --> 00:28:11.460
<v Speaker 1>very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really high.</v>

550
00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:12.563
<v Speaker 1>And you know that because maybe you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to someone happens when I'm </v>

551
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:15.420
<v Speaker 1>lecturing.</v>

552
00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:17.790
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not really on top of things,</v>

553
00:28:17.791 --> 00:28:18.624
<v Speaker 1>I'll get self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a terrible thing to have </v>

554
00:28:20.791 --> 00:28:22.050
<v Speaker 1>happen when you lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

555
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:24.480
<v Speaker 1>just makes you stumble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's going well,</v>

556
00:28:24.481 --> 00:28:27.210
<v Speaker 1>I know where I'm going and I'd have all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these little routines,</v>

557
00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:28.343
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that our stories and things that I know </v>

558
00:28:29.701 --> 00:28:34.380
<v Speaker 1>that they just automatically sequence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I have to do is point the lecture in</v>

559
00:28:34.381 --> 00:28:36.150
<v Speaker 1>the right direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

560
00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.520
<v Speaker 1>the things that are logically associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

561
00:28:38.521 --> 00:28:39.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

562
00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:43.770
<v Speaker 1>the direction of the lecture will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll come up there,</v>

563
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:44.663
<v Speaker 1>they're primed in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so Swanson helped me understand the </v>

564
00:28:50.101 --> 00:28:52.380
<v Speaker 1>functions of the lower part of the brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite well.</v>

565
00:28:52.381 --> 00:28:53.214
<v Speaker 1>And then to map that on to piaget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things he helped me </v>

566
00:28:55.471 --> 00:28:56.304
<v Speaker 1>understand was just exactly how </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated the lower parts of the </v>

567
00:28:59.431 --> 00:28:59.970
<v Speaker 1>brain are.</v>

568
00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:04.970
<v Speaker 1>The more automatic parts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the behavior is used to believe that</v>

569
00:29:05.011 --> 00:29:05.844
<v Speaker 1>or did believe and still believe to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree that a lot of your behavior is </v>

570
00:29:09.121 --> 00:29:09.954
<v Speaker 1>reflexive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the radical behavior is the guys </v>

571
00:29:12.391 --> 00:29:13.224
<v Speaker 1>from the 50s but more or less made the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case that even complex behavior among </v>

572
00:29:17.011 --> 00:29:21.060
<v Speaker 1>animals is nothing but the chaining </v>
<v Speaker 1>together of automatic reflexes.</v>

573
00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:24.630
<v Speaker 1>So it was deterministic chain of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of reflexes.</v>

574
00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.780
<v Speaker 1>Well you do have reflex actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

575
00:29:27.781 --> 00:29:28.614
<v Speaker 1>so if you touch a hot stove,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll jerk your hand away and your </v>

576
00:29:31.561 --> 00:29:32.394
<v Speaker 1>brain isn't involved in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just your spinal cord that's </v>

577
00:29:34.291 --> 00:29:35.124
<v Speaker 1>involved in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now your brain's involved when the pain </v>

578
00:29:37.471 --> 00:29:40.740
<v Speaker 1>hits and maybe that's so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped doing it in the future,</v>

579
00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:41.883
<v Speaker 1>but you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conscious part of your brain is too </v>

580
00:29:43.421 --> 00:29:45.580
<v Speaker 1>slow to get your hand away from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

581
00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:46.690
<v Speaker 1>from the stove and time.</v>

582
00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:51.400
<v Speaker 1>And so what's happening in your body in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some senses that you have these multiple</v>

583
00:29:51.401 --> 00:29:56.120
<v Speaker 1>layers of neurological organization and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them are quite fixed there.</v>

584
00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:59.470
<v Speaker 1>They're automatic deterministic systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>and those are things you really,</v>

585
00:29:59.471 --> 00:30:02.950
<v Speaker 1>really practiced and that you could just</v>
<v Speaker 1>run as a routine.</v>

586
00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:04.203
<v Speaker 1>And then above that are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are those things that you chained </v>

587
00:30:05.951 --> 00:30:06.784
<v Speaker 1>together but they could be chained </v>
<v Speaker 1>together in different ways so they're </v>

588
00:30:09.281 --> 00:30:11.710
<v Speaker 1>less automatized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you keep going up,</v>

589
00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:16.740
<v Speaker 1>they get more and more complex and less </v>
<v Speaker 1>automatized until out the top,</v>

590
00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.270
<v Speaker 1>which is where your consciousness is </v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

591
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:22.030
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to program what you're doing.</v>

592
00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:23.223
<v Speaker 1>You know when you have to pay very </v>
<v Speaker 1>careful attention to how to go about </v>

593
00:30:26.051 --> 00:30:28.900
<v Speaker 1>doing this because you don't have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems built into you.</v>

594
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:32.280
<v Speaker 1>So you know what that's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're trying to learn something new,</v>

595
00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:35.890
<v Speaker 1>it takes a lot of energy and you really </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to pay a 10 pay attention.</v>

596
00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:38.440
<v Speaker 1>And then once you start to get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

597
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:39.423
<v Speaker 1>well there's phase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What really happens is those things you </v>

598
00:30:43.001 --> 00:30:46.600
<v Speaker 1>don't have to think about anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And thank God for that because you know,</v>

599
00:30:46.601 --> 00:30:47.434
<v Speaker 1>first of all you can't think that much </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you're a pretty limited capacity </v>

600
00:30:50.351 --> 00:30:54.040
<v Speaker 1>process or in second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the programming is quite difficult.</v>

601
00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:55.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

602
00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:57.300
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

603
00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:59.310
<v Speaker 1>so let's see here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I've got.</v>

604
00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:17.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what,</v>

605
00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.320
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you look on the right there,</v>

606
00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:25.633
<v Speaker 1>there's a little diagram that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical die or a little table </v>

607
00:31:28.311 --> 00:31:31.370
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's talking about the motor system.</v>

608
00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:32.473
<v Speaker 1>Now the motor system is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what allows you to output action and </v>

609
00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:38.893
<v Speaker 1>like you're out putting action at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of levels that you don't even </v>

610
00:31:40.611 --> 00:31:41.444
<v Speaker 1>realize because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think that that site is a </v>

611
00:31:43.761 --> 00:31:45.860
<v Speaker 1>sensory activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

612
00:31:45.861 --> 00:31:46.694
<v Speaker 1>but that there's a very tight </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between sensory activity </v>

613
00:31:50.331 --> 00:31:52.070
<v Speaker 1>and motor activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

614
00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:53.173
<v Speaker 1>when you're looking at a scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you don't know what your </v>

615
00:31:54.771 --> 00:31:55.604
<v Speaker 1>eyes are going like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason they're going like that </v>

616
00:31:57.951 --> 00:31:58.784
<v Speaker 1>is because if you held your eyes </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely still and you can actually </v>

617
00:32:01.041 --> 00:32:03.770
<v Speaker 1>learn to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you hold your eyes absolutely still,</v>

618
00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:06.050
<v Speaker 1>your vision will fade right out and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't see anything.</v>

619
00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:08.270
<v Speaker 1>And it's because the little neuro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little,</v>

620
00:32:08.271 --> 00:32:09.104
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>retinal cells that are picking up the </v>

621
00:32:10.941 --> 00:32:12.080
<v Speaker 1>light get exhausted.</v>

622
00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:15.130
<v Speaker 1>And so then they stopped transmitting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so part of the reason you're zipping</v>

623
00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:17.510
<v Speaker 1>your eyes back and forth is so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

624
00:32:17.511 --> 00:32:18.344
<v Speaker 1>different parts of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can process the scene and it doesn't </v>

625
00:32:20.841 --> 00:32:24.050
<v Speaker 1>get exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And plus you're also looking around,</v>

626
00:32:24.051 --> 00:32:26.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're looking at when things move,</v>

627
00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you direct your attention to that.</v>

628
00:32:28.131 --> 00:32:28.964
<v Speaker 1>Or if someone makes a gesture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're actually kind of using your </v>

629
00:32:31.761 --> 00:32:33.680
<v Speaker 1>eyes like tentacles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

630
00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:34.400
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

631
00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:38.860
<v Speaker 1>to check out the information that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>coated in the light and,</v>

632
00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:41.120
<v Speaker 1>and even when you're here and that sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing,</v>

633
00:32:41.121 --> 00:32:43.460
<v Speaker 1>there's a fair bit of motor activity </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with it.</v>

634
00:32:43.461 --> 00:32:44.294
<v Speaker 1>You turn your head unconsciously and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of little motor </v>

635
00:32:46.581 --> 00:32:49.010
<v Speaker 1>actions in your ear that also helps you </v>
<v Speaker 1>tune in.</v>

636
00:32:49.011 --> 00:32:51.140
<v Speaker 1>And so those things are tightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated.</v>

637
00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:55.730
<v Speaker 1>But roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the motor output is action.</v>

638
00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:57.553
<v Speaker 1>And then Swanson shows that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>these layers in the nervous system that </v>

639
00:33:02.571 --> 00:33:04.250
<v Speaker 1>go from the spinal cord upward.</v>

640
00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:05.863
<v Speaker 1>The first ones are the somatic motor </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuron pools and the second are </v>

641
00:33:08.601 --> 00:33:09.434
<v Speaker 1>locomotor pattern generators in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>third are locomotor pattern initiators </v>

642
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:18.050
<v Speaker 1>and then the fourth r locomotor pattern </v>
<v Speaker 1>controllers to hire.</v>

643
00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:18.913
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the way to kind of lay piaget on it </v>

644
00:33:20.811 --> 00:33:21.644
<v Speaker 1>in some senses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think of the somatic motor neuron </v>

645
00:33:23.991 --> 00:33:28.991
<v Speaker 1>pools as simple actions that can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>implemented automatically.</v>

646
00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:35.380
<v Speaker 1>And then the locomotor pattern generator</v>
<v Speaker 1>has taken those simple actions and chain</v>

647
00:33:35.541 --> 00:33:40.430
<v Speaker 1>them into relatively more complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>melodies of action.</v>

648
00:33:40.431 --> 00:33:45.431
<v Speaker 1>So kinetic melodies and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>locomotor pattern initiator,</v>

649
00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:46.483
<v Speaker 1>more or less decides when those </v>
<v Speaker 1>Connecticut Maliki should be </v>

650
00:33:48.771 --> 00:33:50.990
<v Speaker 1>implemented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even that can be unconscious.</v>

651
00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:54.890
<v Speaker 1>And then so it's still at that level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain organization.</v>

652
00:33:54.891 --> 00:33:55.724
<v Speaker 1>It's still more or less automatic even </v>
<v Speaker 1>stimulus response as a way to think </v>

653
00:33:58.401 --> 00:33:59.234
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you go one level higher and </v>

654
00:34:00.681 --> 00:34:05.660
<v Speaker 1>that's where you get the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily use these automated things.</v>

655
00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:08.060
<v Speaker 1>So I could show you an example of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>this works.</v>

656
00:34:08.061 --> 00:34:08.894
<v Speaker 1>So this is called a ballistic movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to take my hand and I'm </v>

657
00:34:13.461 --> 00:34:16.520
<v Speaker 1>going to bring it down really fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right towards that edge.</v>

658
00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:17.533
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

659
00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.470
<v Speaker 1>all right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's very fast movement.</v>

660
00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.900
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's cool about that</v>

661
00:34:23.901 --> 00:34:28.760
<v Speaker 1>movement is that I don't have time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once that action starts,</v>

662
00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:32.720
<v Speaker 1>it happens so fast that it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the time the,</v>

663
00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:33.913
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

664
00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.560
<v Speaker 1>information about the action actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets to my brain.</v>

665
00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:39.740
<v Speaker 1>So I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once I let that go,</v>

666
00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:43.580
<v Speaker 1>I can't control it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I basically am doing is</v>

667
00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:45.943
<v Speaker 1>disinhibiting the motor control systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are already have established in my </v>

668
00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:51.973
<v Speaker 1>psychophysiological being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm disinhibiting one of those and then </v>

669
00:34:55.401 --> 00:34:56.234
<v Speaker 1>it runs automatically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what you're doing all the </v>

670
00:34:58.641 --> 00:35:02.810
<v Speaker 1>time when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're acting in life and it's,</v>

671
00:35:02.811 --> 00:35:03.644
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a neat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a paper a while back with an </v>

672
00:35:05.151 --> 00:35:05.984
<v Speaker 1>undergraduate student of who's who's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a pretty break character and we </v>

673
00:35:10.401 --> 00:35:11.660
<v Speaker 1>got invited to do a paper.</v>

674
00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.000
<v Speaker 1>I got invited to do a paper on free </v>
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>

675
00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.600
<v Speaker 1>And so we were thinking about free will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

676
00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:17.443
<v Speaker 1>and it's very interesting to think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>freewill in relationship to these </v>

677
00:35:20.361 --> 00:35:21.194
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies because it sort of goes like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is that out there in the future </v>

678
00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:26.653
<v Speaker 1>you've got free will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as the future moves towards the </v>

679
00:35:29.301 --> 00:35:31.130
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't like,</v>

680
00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.870
<v Speaker 1>once it gets close enough to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>

681
00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.920
<v Speaker 1>you have to have initiated something </v>
<v Speaker 1>automatic that will happen.</v>

682
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:41.460
<v Speaker 1>And so I can give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who play the piano very well,</v>

683
00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:46.490
<v Speaker 1>they look ahead of where they're playing</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the music because they know how to do</v>

684
00:35:47.851 --> 00:35:49.050
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to think about it.</v>

685
00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:49.913
<v Speaker 1>What they have to do is look ahead so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the part of them that knows how to </v>

686
00:35:52.141 --> 00:35:55.920
<v Speaker 1>do this gets ready to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of you are experts in that way.</v>

687
00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:56.753
<v Speaker 1>Likely all of those of you who drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're also experts that way because </v>

688
00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.980
<v Speaker 1>when you're driving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do you look?</v>

689
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:03.533
<v Speaker 1>If you're a good driver on the highway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look like at least half a second or </v>

690
00:36:06.421 --> 00:36:08.400
<v Speaker 1>a second ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

691
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:09.743
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because 50 feet ahead has already </v>

692
00:36:11.341 --> 00:36:12.990
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

693
00:36:12.991 --> 00:36:15.630
<v Speaker 1>It's too close in time for you to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about it.</v>

694
00:36:15.631 --> 00:36:16.464
<v Speaker 1>So basically what you're doing is you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the road and then you're </v>

695
00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:20.723
<v Speaker 1>disinhibiting sequences of action that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are the ones that are going to </v>

696
00:36:24.601 --> 00:36:27.120
<v Speaker 1>correspond to what you want to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the road most,</v>

697
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:29.850
<v Speaker 1>most adequately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as you know,</v>

698
00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.820
<v Speaker 1>the closer you get to executing one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those motor behaviors,</v>

699
00:36:32.821 --> 00:36:36.750
<v Speaker 1>the more automatic automated it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by the time you manifest the action,</v>

700
00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:39.270
<v Speaker 1>there's no free there at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you are,</v>

701
00:36:39.271 --> 00:36:41.850
<v Speaker 1>you said enough to be released in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

702
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:43.230
<v Speaker 1>So I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

703
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:46.110
<v Speaker 1>this isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no freewill in that.</v>

704
00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.290
<v Speaker 1>But there was in deciding to do it at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that point.</v>

705
00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:55.010
<v Speaker 1>So and so that's sort of how your auto </v>
<v Speaker 1>automaticity meets your freedom,</v>

706
00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:56.563
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to think about it as something </v>

707
00:36:57.031 --> 00:36:59.430
<v Speaker 1>extending across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

708
00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:03.840
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so having established that,</v>

709
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:07.410
<v Speaker 1>then we're going to get into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

710
00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:09.230
<v Speaker 1>the more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

711
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:14.580
<v Speaker 1>neurological localization a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>

712
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.863
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you collect all these patterns of </v>

713
00:37:16.501 --> 00:37:19.050
<v Speaker 1>behavior and then you automate them into</v>
<v Speaker 1>routines.</v>

714
00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:21.600
<v Speaker 1>I could give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for a child,</v>

715
00:37:21.601 --> 00:37:23.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when a child first comes,</v>

716
00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:24.053
<v Speaker 1>when a child is first born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you tap on the cheek and we'll go </v>

717
00:37:25.981 --> 00:37:28.950
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called a rooting reflex and it will</v>

718
00:37:28.951 --> 00:37:30.990
<v Speaker 1>move its mouth and tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

719
00:37:30.991 --> 00:37:32.910
<v Speaker 1>what it's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

720
00:37:32.911 --> 00:37:35.330
<v Speaker 1>is searching for a nipple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you just put your finger there,</v>

721
00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:38.040
<v Speaker 1>then clamp onto that and start to suck.</v>

722
00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:42.060
<v Speaker 1>And so the child comes out with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability and that's a reflex.</v>

723
00:37:42.061 --> 00:37:42.894
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of built into the neurology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then when the child starts to </v>

724
00:37:46.321 --> 00:37:48.570
<v Speaker 1>interact with the mother to actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>breastfeed,</v>

725
00:37:48.571 --> 00:37:49.404
<v Speaker 1>well then that initial reflex has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>modified quite substantially in the </v>

726
00:37:54.691 --> 00:37:56.550
<v Speaker 1>context of the relationship with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>

727
00:37:56.551 --> 00:37:59.940
<v Speaker 1>Because the bear reflex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's enough to get the thing going,</v>

728
00:37:59.941 --> 00:38:00.774
<v Speaker 1>but it's not enough to make it work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so often mothers take a fair bit of </v>

729
00:38:04.561 --> 00:38:07.800
<v Speaker 1>time to learn how to breastfeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also because the baby is taking</v>

730
00:38:07.801 --> 00:38:09.390
<v Speaker 1>a fair bit of time to learn how to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

731
00:38:09.391 --> 00:38:13.260
<v Speaker 1>So they have to establish the dance that</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes with that.</v>

732
00:38:13.261 --> 00:38:15.390
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's quite cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

733
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.610
<v Speaker 1>about that dance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

734
00:38:17.611 --> 00:38:18.444
<v Speaker 1>is there's been studies done of </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed and non depressed mothers </v>

735
00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:22.253
<v Speaker 1>interacting with their infants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you take a non depressed </v>

736
00:38:24.931 --> 00:38:28.890
<v Speaker 1>mother interacting with their infant and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just film them and then you speed up</v>

737
00:38:28.891 --> 00:38:31.230
<v Speaker 1>the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see like the mothers,</v>

738
00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.460
<v Speaker 1>the baby reacts and above the reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the baby reacts and the mother reacts.</v>

739
00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like a dance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

740
00:38:35.651 --> 00:38:38.650
<v Speaker 1>there's this continual flow of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information between the two of them.</v>

741
00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.660
<v Speaker 1>And if the babies with a depressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>

742
00:38:40.661 --> 00:38:42.670
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Jerky and,</v>

743
00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:46.990
<v Speaker 1>and discontinuous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you think about that,</v>

744
00:38:46.991 --> 00:38:48.820
<v Speaker 1>you can see how the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

745
00:38:48.821 --> 00:38:49.654
<v Speaker 1>the dialectical interaction between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother and child is building up the </v>

746
00:38:52.781 --> 00:38:53.614
<v Speaker 1>child's repertoire of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of complex abilities within a social </v>

747
00:38:58.391 --> 00:38:59.350
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

748
00:38:59.351 --> 00:39:00.184
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I told you guys before the </v>

749
00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.330
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

750
00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:07.030
<v Speaker 1>kids really get socialized to play with </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>

751
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:09.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between two and four.</v>

752
00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:13.630
<v Speaker 1>But that's not exactly true because even</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lower level,</v>

753
00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:18.430
<v Speaker 1>more automated and more primordial </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflex behaviors,</v>

754
00:39:18.431 --> 00:39:19.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

755
00:39:19.211 --> 00:39:21.400
<v Speaker 1>like the ones that are associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>breastfeeding,</v>

756
00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:23.980
<v Speaker 1>even those developed under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>constraints of a,</v>

757
00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:29.140
<v Speaker 1>of social guidelines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So society's always there right from the</v>

758
00:39:29.141 --> 00:39:30.310
<v Speaker 1>reflex level up.</v>

759
00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:31.563
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens when kids are between two </v>

760
00:39:33.671 --> 00:39:35.890
<v Speaker 1>and four is they have to learn to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually play.</v>

761
00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:40.000
<v Speaker 1>They have to learn how to play complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>games with other children.</v>

762
00:39:40.001 --> 00:39:41.710
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that involves,</v>

763
00:39:41.711 --> 00:39:42.544
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>communication and negotiation had a </v>

764
00:39:44.321 --> 00:39:47.320
<v Speaker 1>verbal level and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also with people their own age.</v>

765
00:39:47.321 --> 00:39:48.154
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's continuous in some sense of </v>

766
00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:52.660
<v Speaker 1>discontinuous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in another sense,</v>

767
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:53.920
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

768
00:39:53.921 --> 00:39:54.581
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

769
00:39:54.581 --> 00:39:58.210
<v Speaker 1>why do you bother straining all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things together and well,</v>

770
00:39:58.211 --> 00:40:00.150
<v Speaker 1>you think about the breastfeeding </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues,</v>

771
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:01.023
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why does it baby bothered to learn how </v>

772
00:40:01.751 --> 00:40:02.800
<v Speaker 1>to breastfeed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

773
00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:04.270
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

774
00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:05.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

775
00:40:05.471 --> 00:40:08.110
<v Speaker 1>if it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it doesn't live,</v>

776
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:09.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

777
00:40:09.211 --> 00:40:12.400
<v Speaker 1>and there's a bunch of reasons for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like one is obviously it's good not</v>

778
00:40:12.401 --> 00:40:14.740
<v Speaker 1>going to be nourished properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although you know,</v>

779
00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:16.690
<v Speaker 1>there are things you can do to </v>
<v Speaker 1>substitute for that.</v>

780
00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:20.560
<v Speaker 1>Although still breastfeeding still seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the best thing you can do for your</v>

781
00:40:20.561 --> 00:40:21.940
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

782
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:22.953
<v Speaker 1>although you can work around it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fundamentally it seems to be the </v>

783
00:40:24.941 --> 00:40:25.774
<v Speaker 1>best thing that you could do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the babies also learning all </v>

784
00:40:27.791 --> 00:40:28.624
<v Speaker 1>sorts of other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's got skin to skin contact and </v>

785
00:40:30.641 --> 00:40:33.670
<v Speaker 1>it snuggling and it's being comforted </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's doing eye gaze,</v>

786
00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:34.563
<v Speaker 1>eye gaze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's cooling and the mother's </v>

787
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:36.303
<v Speaker 1>imitating it and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just a lot of things going on </v>

788
00:40:38.441 --> 00:40:39.274
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the child is organizing all of </v>

789
00:40:41.761 --> 00:40:45.250
<v Speaker 1>that partly to fulfill a basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological need,</v>

790
00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:47.800
<v Speaker 1>which is post two needs both thirst and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunger,</v>

791
00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:50.770
<v Speaker 1>but it's also fulfilling its need for </v>
<v Speaker 1>play for example,</v>

792
00:40:50.771 --> 00:40:53.270
<v Speaker 1>because children have a circuit for </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

793
00:40:53.271 --> 00:40:58.030
<v Speaker 1>So you could say play as part of the ID.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fundamental biological need.</v>

794
00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:02.140
<v Speaker 1>The other thing children have to have is</v>
<v Speaker 1>skin to skin touch.</v>

795
00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.990
<v Speaker 1>They'll die without it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not optional.</v>

796
00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:05.993
<v Speaker 1>You even see that in rats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you take a rat pop away from its </v>

797
00:41:08.981 --> 00:41:12.190
<v Speaker 1>mother and you feed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't do anything with it,</v>

798
00:41:12.191 --> 00:41:13.270
<v Speaker 1>it just dies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

799
00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:15.760
<v Speaker 1>it goes into opiate overdose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

800
00:41:15.761 --> 00:41:18.700
<v Speaker 1>it's gastrointestinal system shutdown </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it dies.</v>

801
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.330
<v Speaker 1>And you can stop that from happening by </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolating it,</v>

802
00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.193
<v Speaker 1>feeding it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then like massaging it with the </v>

803
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:26.200
<v Speaker 1>pencil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the eraser,</v>

804
00:41:26.201 --> 00:41:28.960
<v Speaker 1>end of a pencil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can keep the rat pup alive.</v>

805
00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:30.183
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jaak Panksepp was one of the people who </v>

806
00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:34.150
<v Speaker 1>either discovered that over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked on it.</v>

807
00:41:34.151 --> 00:41:37.740
<v Speaker 1>And that work was extended by Tiffany </v>
<v Speaker 1>Fields at,</v>

808
00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:40.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a hospital in Florida.</v>

809
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:41.263
<v Speaker 1>Some really brilliant work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was looking at Panksepp's work on </v>

810
00:41:44.331 --> 00:41:47.590
<v Speaker 1>the necessity of tactile stimulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

811
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:48.471
<v Speaker 1>she thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

812
00:41:48.471 --> 00:41:51.230
<v Speaker 1>I bet we could try that with premature </v>
<v Speaker 1>babies cause you know,</v>

813
00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:54.050
<v Speaker 1>if a baby's premature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of things are problems.</v>

814
00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:55.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

815
00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:59.000
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the term pregnancies are </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuts when babies late on fat,</v>

816
00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:01.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they come out and they're sort of,</v>

817
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:02.023
<v Speaker 1>they've got some storage storage there </v>
<v Speaker 1>in case things don't get going very </v>

818
00:42:05.001 --> 00:42:05.834
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

819
00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:08.810
<v Speaker 1>and they're gaining a lot of weight to </v>
<v Speaker 1>not last period of pregnancy.</v>

820
00:42:08.811 --> 00:42:12.020
<v Speaker 1>So if they come up with premature then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really skinny.</v>

821
00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:15.770
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens often is they </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to lose weight and that's not good</v>

822
00:42:15.771 --> 00:42:18.470
<v Speaker 1>because they should be ramping up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight gain really quick.</v>

823
00:42:18.471 --> 00:42:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Like a newborn baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They outgrew its closed at one week.</v>

824
00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:22.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things are there,</v>

825
00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:23.913
<v Speaker 1>they're gaining weight quickly to do the</v>
<v Speaker 1>premature babies lose weight and you </v>

826
00:42:27.261 --> 00:42:28.970
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to keep them going.</v>

827
00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:31.790
<v Speaker 1>They put them in an incubator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feed them.</v>

828
00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:35.960
<v Speaker 1>But what tiffany feel dead was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had the nurses go in there,</v>

829
00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:37.423
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with with gloves and massage the babies </v>

830
00:42:39.561 --> 00:42:41.100
<v Speaker 1>for 10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three times a day.</v>

831
00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:41.933
<v Speaker 1>And those babies gained weight as fast </v>
<v Speaker 1>as babies that were still in utero and </v>

832
00:42:45.651 --> 00:42:49.190
<v Speaker 1>you could still detect the differences </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their development six months later,</v>

833
00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:51.710
<v Speaker 1>which in baby terms is like forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

834
00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:52.813
<v Speaker 1>I mean you change as much from zero </v>
<v Speaker 1>months to six months as you probably do </v>

835
00:42:55.281 --> 00:42:59.660
<v Speaker 1>from six months to 20 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a radical transformation.</v>

836
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:01.370
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

837
00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:06.380
<v Speaker 1>The reason I'm telling you all this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you lay out these hierarchies of</v>

838
00:43:06.561 --> 00:43:07.394
<v Speaker 1>behavior that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well an automatized had brought under </v>

839
00:43:09.861 --> 00:43:13.880
<v Speaker 1>the control of social conditioning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you really do them in the service of</v>

840
00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:15.003
<v Speaker 1>of well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the question in the service of </v>

841
00:43:18.471 --> 00:43:21.620
<v Speaker 1>we'll say biological necessity for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sake of argument.</v>

842
00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.450
<v Speaker 1>Well you have to eat and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>drink.</v>

843
00:43:23.451 --> 00:43:24.284
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons you lay out the </v>

844
00:43:26.331 --> 00:43:28.820
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy that's associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>breastfeeding,</v>

845
00:43:28.821 --> 00:43:29.654
<v Speaker 1>and so you can do that directly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also so that you can establish a </v>

846
00:43:33.141 --> 00:43:36.740
<v Speaker 1>relationship so that not only are you </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it directly this day,</v>

847
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:39.070
<v Speaker 1>but you're also going to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

848
00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:41.300
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow and the next day and the day </v>
<v Speaker 1>after that.</v>

849
00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:45.730
<v Speaker 1>And so the hunger system is integrated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with these other systems of,</v>

850
00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:46.673
<v Speaker 1>of biological constraint in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're trying to come up with an </v>

851
00:43:51.171 --> 00:43:56.171
<v Speaker 1>answer to the continual problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have dedicated biological systems</v>

852
00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:02.200
<v Speaker 1>that help you address problems that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with your biological nature,</v>

853
00:44:02.331 --> 00:44:05.420
<v Speaker 1>that are universal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those would be the things that Freud</v>

854
00:44:05.421 --> 00:44:09.710
<v Speaker 1>would describe as the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can think of these hierarchies of</v>

855
00:44:09.711 --> 00:44:10.544
<v Speaker 1>motor behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which sort of develop into </v>

856
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:16.190
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities as nested in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

857
00:44:16.191 --> 00:44:17.024
<v Speaker 1>inside motivational states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's the motor behavior hierarchy </v>

858
00:44:22.431 --> 00:44:23.264
<v Speaker 1>that use when you're angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a motor behavior hierarchy you </v>

859
00:44:25.181 --> 00:44:28.700
<v Speaker 1>use when you're distressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And kids get very good at that,</v>

860
00:44:28.701 --> 00:44:30.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they'll cry,</v>

861
00:44:30.291 --> 00:44:33.990
<v Speaker 1>which is a reflex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by the time they're about to,</v>

862
00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:36.630
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty damn good at crying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

863
00:44:36.631 --> 00:44:37.464
<v Speaker 1>they've got a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got a cry that sounds like </v>

864
00:44:38.731 --> 00:44:40.470
<v Speaker 1>they're sad and upset when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>really angry.</v>

865
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:42.023
<v Speaker 1>And so if you really listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can hear the difference because a </v>

866
00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:47.550
<v Speaker 1>baby angry baby sounds different than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sad baby.</v>

867
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.270
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't listen to baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have you think and it's sad,</v>

868
00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:53.400
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you'll feel sorry for it and go,</v>

869
00:44:53.401 --> 00:44:54.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>help it out.</v>

870
00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:56.370
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just thinking up years,</v>

871
00:44:56.371 --> 00:44:59.640
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we know this partly because,</v>

872
00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:03.330
<v Speaker 1>so let's say you've got a baby and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>under nine months,</v>

873
00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:04.193
<v Speaker 1>six months old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's crying and it's critical to </v>

874
00:45:05.571 --> 00:45:06.121
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what,</v>

875
00:45:06.121 --> 00:45:06.954
<v Speaker 1>what should you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd go in there and he'd pick up the </v>

876
00:45:07.771 --> 00:45:08.604
<v Speaker 1>baby and you comforted and you probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that pretty much nonstop when the </v>

877
00:45:11.851 --> 00:45:13.020
<v Speaker 1>babies that young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

878
00:45:13.021 --> 00:45:13.854
<v Speaker 1>because they're so young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should really still be in uteral </v>

879
00:45:15.541 --> 00:45:16.500
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really young.</v>

880
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.530
<v Speaker 1>But by nine months that may be starting </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get smart.</v>

881
00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:24.210
<v Speaker 1>And so it's about nine months when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>can visually recognize people that knows</v>

882
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:28.680
<v Speaker 1>and people it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people here she doesn't know and so then</v>

883
00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:30.203
<v Speaker 1>the babies in there and it's you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>squawking a bit and so want some </v>

884
00:45:33.031 --> 00:45:33.864
<v Speaker 1>attention and then someone walks in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the mother and the baby bursts </v>

885
00:45:36.721 --> 00:45:37.554
<v Speaker 1>into terrorists and people think all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that baby's all sad because it's mother </v>

886
00:45:39.961 --> 00:45:40.500
<v Speaker 1>didn't show up.</v>

887
00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:41.333
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really irritated that the wrong </v>

888
00:45:43.831 --> 00:45:44.664
<v Speaker 1>person showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell that because people </v>

889
00:45:46.621 --> 00:45:47.454
<v Speaker 1>have done facial coding of the baby's </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression and also it's skin tone and </v>

890
00:45:51.241 --> 00:45:54.330
<v Speaker 1>an angry baby looks angry first of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it turns all red.</v>

891
00:45:54.331 --> 00:45:55.164
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's really angry and you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>that behavior later too and temper </v>

892
00:45:58.471 --> 00:45:59.304
<v Speaker 1>tantrums like a two year old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounding a temper tantrum is just </v>

893
00:46:02.281 --> 00:46:06.660
<v Speaker 1>having a fit of rage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rage system,</v>

894
00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:10.050
<v Speaker 1>because there is a rage system is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely out of control.</v>

895
00:46:10.051 --> 00:46:12.480
<v Speaker 1>It's just absolutely dominating their </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

896
00:46:12.481 --> 00:46:13.314
<v Speaker 1>And you don't really want to encourage </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because the rage system should </v>

897
00:46:16.801 --> 00:46:21.510
<v Speaker 1>start to be modulated by other systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>and other higher order control systems.</v>

898
00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:22.463
<v Speaker 1>Not so much suppressed or repressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of how the Friday comes </v>

899
00:46:25.021 --> 00:46:25.854
<v Speaker 1>with thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but integrated into more complex and </v>

900
00:46:27.961 --> 00:46:31.860
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated modes of action so the </v>
<v Speaker 1>child can use its anger,</v>

901
00:46:31.861 --> 00:46:34.990
<v Speaker 1>which is an extraordinary and useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity,</v>

902
00:46:34.991 --> 00:46:36.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it allows you to defend yourself</v>

903
00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:41.070
<v Speaker 1>so the child can learn to use that in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated way so that they can solve</v>

904
00:46:41.071 --> 00:46:45.810
<v Speaker 1>the problems that would lead to a range </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack without ever getting to the point</v>

905
00:46:45.811 --> 00:46:47.610
<v Speaker 1>where it has to be enraged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

906
00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:50.250
<v Speaker 1>That's a functional child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's learned to repress,</v>

907
00:46:50.251 --> 00:46:51.084
<v Speaker 1>it's anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just that it gets along with </v>

908
00:46:51.991 --> 00:46:53.550
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never has to get angry.</v>

909
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.050
<v Speaker 1>So now some kids learn to repress the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ranger because you know,</v>

910
00:46:58.051 --> 00:46:58.884
<v Speaker 1>they're in a household where any </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of anger is dealt with </v>

911
00:47:03.001 --> 00:47:04.080
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very harshly.</v>

912
00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:05.153
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe there's a rule that everyone </v>

913
00:47:06.481 --> 00:47:08.490
<v Speaker 1>has to be nice to each other all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

914
00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:11.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or else sort of a paradoxical rule.</v>

915
00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:13.283
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine now there's a lot of </v>

916
00:47:14.701 --> 00:47:15.534
<v Speaker 1>these biological systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I want to show you some of their </v>

917
00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.390
<v Speaker 1>instantiation here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's look at this one.</v>

918
00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:25.020
<v Speaker 1>So when you get up above the spinal </v>
<v Speaker 1>cord,</v>

919
00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:28.620
<v Speaker 1>there's a little brain area I'll show </v>
<v Speaker 1>you about how big it is.</v>

920
00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:32.230
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's your brain,</v>

921
00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:33.170
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

922
00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:35.830
<v Speaker 1>the top on part of a part on top.</v>

923
00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:36.813
<v Speaker 1>That's the cerebral cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the part that people are really </v>

924
00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:40.030
<v Speaker 1>proud of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

925
00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:41.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at our cerebral cortex.</v>

926
00:47:41.921 --> 00:47:42.900
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>

927
00:47:42.901 --> 00:47:46.570
<v Speaker 1>it have a lot of neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in the middle there,</v>

928
00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:47.573
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are older brain areas and find a </v>

929
00:47:49.631 --> 00:47:50.464
<v Speaker 1>genetically old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as you go down towards the </v>

930
00:47:51.611 --> 00:47:52.444
<v Speaker 1>spinal cord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they basically get older and older and </v>

931
00:47:53.531 --> 00:47:55.270
<v Speaker 1>older and older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

932
00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:59.230
<v Speaker 1>and more and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>critical to your development.</v>

933
00:47:59.231 --> 00:48:00.064
<v Speaker 1>So the serotonin system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about it a little bit in </v>

934
00:48:01.601 --> 00:48:02.434
<v Speaker 1>lobsters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

935
00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:03.333
<v Speaker 1>Serotonin system is the thing that sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of determines where a lobster is in the </v>

936
00:48:06.881 --> 00:48:10.600
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy determines whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>it stands like this or whether it stands</v>

937
00:48:10.601 --> 00:48:12.760
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an old system.</v>

938
00:48:12.761 --> 00:48:15.010
<v Speaker 1>And when your brain is developing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Utero,</v>

939
00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:17.800
<v Speaker 1>it's a serotonin system that guides its </v>
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>

940
00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:18.873
<v Speaker 1>So that's how important it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like the conductor of the </v>

941
00:48:21.101 --> 00:48:21.934
<v Speaker 1>orchestra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the thing that controls </v>

942
00:48:24.851 --> 00:48:28.150
<v Speaker 1>the entire unfolding of the brain and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from,</v>

943
00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:29.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

944
00:48:29.441 --> 00:48:32.040
<v Speaker 1>really it's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really archaic systems.</v>

945
00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:34.780
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

946
00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:35.643
<v Speaker 1>you're being is controlled by these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are ancient beyond </v>

947
00:48:37.811 --> 00:48:39.640
<v Speaker 1>comprehension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

948
00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

949
00:48:41.051 --> 00:48:42.370
<v Speaker 1>you looked at the hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

950
00:48:42.371 --> 00:48:43.720
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not very big.</v>

951
00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:45.580
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

952
00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:49.540
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you take a cat and you,</v>

953
00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:50.403
<v Speaker 1>so cat green looks something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take off all the stuff that's in </v>

954
00:48:53.741 --> 00:48:54.574
<v Speaker 1>light orange and most of the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff above the hypothalamus that's in </v>

955
00:48:57.881 --> 00:49:01.390
<v Speaker 1>white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just take all that out and it's a female</v>

956
00:49:01.391 --> 00:49:02.224
<v Speaker 1>cat and it's in a cage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really can't tell the difference </v>

957
00:49:04.031 --> 00:49:06.970
<v Speaker 1>between eight and a cap that has all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of that brain.</v>

958
00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:08.283
<v Speaker 1>Now there's some things that can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't do very well if you take it </v>

959
00:49:11.111 --> 00:49:14.390
<v Speaker 1>into a new situation cause it can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn more,</v>

960
00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:17.230
<v Speaker 1>more important in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't remember.</v>

961
00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:18.753
<v Speaker 1>So it's enough perpetual state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything happening for the very first </v>

962
00:49:21.941 --> 00:49:22.774
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still capable of a lot of the </v>

963
00:49:24.431 --> 00:49:27.370
<v Speaker 1>reactions that would be necessary in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order for you to stay alive.</v>

964
00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:30.640
<v Speaker 1>So it can regulate its liquid intake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can regulate its food intake,</v>

965
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:34.660
<v Speaker 1>it can react sexually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's capable of defensive aggression,</v>

966
00:49:34.661 --> 00:49:35.494
<v Speaker 1>although it'll really fly into a rage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's kind of like a disinhibited </v>

967
00:49:38.681 --> 00:49:40.330
<v Speaker 1>two year old in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

968
00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:42.340
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

969
00:49:42.341 --> 00:49:44.920
<v Speaker 1>as long as you keep it in the cage and </v>
<v Speaker 1>provide it with food and water,</v>

970
00:49:44.921 --> 00:49:48.760
<v Speaker 1>it's like the way it lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's hyper exploratory,</v>

971
00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:51.130
<v Speaker 1>which I think is just weird beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief.</v>

972
00:49:51.131 --> 00:49:54.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like you take the brain off a cap </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then all it wants to do is explore,</v>

973
00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:55.593
<v Speaker 1>which is not what you think at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a cat with no brain is really </v>

974
00:49:58.481 --> 00:50:00.970
<v Speaker 1>curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't make sense.</v>

975
00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:02.043
<v Speaker 1>But it does actually because the systems</v>
<v Speaker 1>that drive your exploratory urge are </v>

976
00:50:06.251 --> 00:50:10.120
<v Speaker 1>rooted in a hypothalamus and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually the same systems.</v>

977
00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:11.520
<v Speaker 1>The it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

978
00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:12.363
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

979
00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:13.443
<v Speaker 1>individual differences in the function </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sensitivity of those systems that </v>

980
00:50:16.421 --> 00:50:19.570
<v Speaker 1>are in part associated with individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences and extroversion.</v>

981
00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:21.013
<v Speaker 1>So extroverts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sort of hyper exploratory and social </v>

982
00:50:22.781 --> 00:50:24.970
<v Speaker 1>situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas introverts aren't.</v>

983
00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:26.223
<v Speaker 1>And the exploratory that that has its </v>
<v Speaker 1>origins in the hypothalamus runs on </v>

984
00:50:31.131 --> 00:50:32.600
<v Speaker 1>dopamine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

985
00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:35.960
<v Speaker 1>and then it runs through the base of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain and then up into your,</v>

986
00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:38.540
<v Speaker 1>up into your prefrontal cortex in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular.</v>

987
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:39.703
<v Speaker 1>And it's also the system that responds </v>
<v Speaker 1>to cocaine and amphetamines and other </v>

988
00:50:42.591 --> 00:50:46.400
<v Speaker 1>drugs that people liked to take because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they heightened positive emotion.</v>

989
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:49.850
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's very ability at a very,</v>

990
00:50:49.851 --> 00:50:50.684
<v Speaker 1>very low level in the brain that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>determines things like the differences </v>

991
00:50:54.351 --> 00:50:57.460
<v Speaker 1>in extroverts and introverts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

992
00:50:57.461 --> 00:51:00.080
<v Speaker 1>it's this tiny little part of the brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>

993
00:51:00.350 --> 00:51:02.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's all you have,</v>

994
00:51:02.691 --> 00:51:04.160
<v Speaker 1>you can get along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not too bad.</v>

995
00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

996
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:10.070
<v Speaker 1>but that's also because it's tiny from </v>
<v Speaker 1>one level of analysis,</v>

997
00:51:10.071 --> 00:51:12.650
<v Speaker 1>but it's really big from another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

998
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:15.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

999
00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:16.423
<v Speaker 1>you can increase your resolution when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing brain analysis all the way </v>

1000
00:51:18.981 --> 00:51:22.670
<v Speaker 1>down to the molecular level and still be</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the brain,</v>

1001
00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:24.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>below the molecular level.</v>

1002
00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:26.480
<v Speaker 1>At the atomic level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of,</v>

1003
00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:28.130
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's made out of atoms,</v>

1004
00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:29.473
<v Speaker 1>but the brain is already there at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>molecular level and it's insanely </v>

1005
00:51:32.541 --> 00:51:33.374
<v Speaker 1>complicated at a molecular level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the hypothalamus is way bigger than </v>

1006
00:51:37.101 --> 00:51:37.934
<v Speaker 1>a molecule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so even though it's small compared </v>

1007
00:51:40.341 --> 00:51:41.174
<v Speaker 1>to the rest of our brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still a whopping big structure by </v>

1008
00:51:44.151 --> 00:51:44.984
<v Speaker 1>atomic standards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a hell of a lot going on </v>

1009
00:51:46.641 --> 00:51:48.560
<v Speaker 1>down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you notice the Hypothalamus,</v>

1010
00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:49.401
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1011
00:51:49.401 --> 00:51:50.630
<v Speaker 1>is there such a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

1012
00:51:50.631 --> 00:51:52.100
<v Speaker 1>is there such a thing as the ID?</v>

1013
00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:53.793
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1014
00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:56.240
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1015
00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:59.210
<v Speaker 1>Is it in the brain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes and no.</v>

1016
00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Really low resolution representation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's in the brain.</v>

1017
00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:05.870
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you might say,</v>

1018
00:52:05.871 --> 00:52:07.400
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a hypothalamus?</v>

1019
00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:09.050
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1020
00:52:09.051 --> 00:52:09.884
<v Speaker 1>yes and no because there's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamic structure and you see it's </v>

1021
00:52:13.011 --> 00:52:14.960
<v Speaker 1>made out of a bunch of things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

1022
00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:16.243
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well should you even group those things </v>

1023
00:52:17.871 --> 00:52:19.040
<v Speaker 1>together?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1024
00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:22.250
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that is it depends on why </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're grouping them together.</v>

1025
00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:23.203
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's useful for some purpose of </v>

1026
00:52:24.981 --> 00:52:27.770
<v Speaker 1>understanding or control to group them </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

1027
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1028
00:52:29.610 --> 00:52:30.443
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are similar in the way that they </v>

1029
00:52:31.821 --> 00:52:32.654
<v Speaker 1>emerge in the course of brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>development and the roughly of the same </v>

1030
00:52:34.851 --> 00:52:35.684
<v Speaker 1>file or genetic age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's lots of reasons to treat </v>

1031
00:52:38.001 --> 00:52:38.834
<v Speaker 1>them as the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's lots of reasons to treat </v>

1032
00:52:40.131 --> 00:52:40.964
<v Speaker 1>them as different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on what you're trying to do </v>

1033
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:45.920
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hypothalamus has all these little</v>

1034
00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:51.310
<v Speaker 2>sub,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1035
00:52:52.170 --> 00:52:52.890
<v Speaker 2>what do you call it?</v>

1036
00:52:52.890 --> 00:52:53.723
<v Speaker 1>Substructures that are really in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense at the core of the sub </v>

1037
00:52:58.021 --> 00:53:01.420
<v Speaker 1>personalities that we talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1038
00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:03.043
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1039
00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:08.690
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is,</v>

1040
00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:09.553
<v Speaker 1>this is Swanson again and he's showing </v>
<v Speaker 1>you this is a rat's brain from the </v>

1041
00:53:13.221 --> 00:53:16.850
<v Speaker 1>bottom and he showing you the layout of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hypothalamus.</v>

1042
00:53:16.851 --> 00:53:19.950
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got all those different nuclei.</v>

1043
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:22.190
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a bunch of things.</v>

1044
00:53:22.191 --> 00:53:23.024
<v Speaker 1>And so here he says the descending </v>
<v Speaker 1>paraventricular nucleus is involved in </v>

1045
00:53:29.191 --> 00:53:32.190
<v Speaker 1>the control of eating and drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's shown in green.</v>

1046
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.910
<v Speaker 1>So that's the thing that when you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>hungry or thirsty,</v>

1047
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:39.330
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing that sort of turns on </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hungry and thirsty.</v>

1048
00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:40.173
<v Speaker 1>Subpersonality and then the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cell groups play a major role in </v>

1049
00:53:44.131 --> 00:53:44.964
<v Speaker 1>controlling two classes of social </v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors that his behavior was </v>

1050
00:53:47.371 --> 00:53:48.204
<v Speaker 1>involving interactions between animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>rep productive as the rand areas and </v>

1051
00:53:52.651 --> 00:53:53.484
<v Speaker 1>defensive the purplish areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now what you can think is you have </v>

1052
00:53:57.991 --> 00:54:00.390
<v Speaker 1>all those little sub routines that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about,</v>

1053
00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:01.373
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are sort of at hand and ready to </v>

1054
00:54:02.461 --> 00:54:03.120
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

1055
00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:03.953
<v Speaker 1>And then they're organized underneath </v>
<v Speaker 1>these major classes of motivation so </v>

1056
00:54:08.371 --> 00:54:12.520
<v Speaker 1>that you have to do something like eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they,</v>

1057
00:54:12.521 --> 00:54:13.354
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's an eating robot in </v>

1058
00:54:14.521 --> 00:54:16.260
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it,</v>

1059
00:54:16.261 --> 00:54:19.260
<v Speaker 1>except it's smarter than not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's alive and conscious.</v>

1060
00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:20.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things are alive,</v>

1061
00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:22.920
<v Speaker 1>they're not machines and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>deterministic.</v>

1062
00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:25.350
<v Speaker 1>They're just sub,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're partial.</v>

1063
00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:26.393
<v Speaker 1>You can pick up them as low resolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities or unit dimensional </v>

1064
00:54:29.611 --> 00:54:30.444
<v Speaker 1>personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause the only thing the eating system </v>

1065
00:54:31.711 --> 00:54:33.360
<v Speaker 1>really cares about is whether or not you</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>

1066
00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:35.460
<v Speaker 1>And the drinking system is the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1067
00:54:35.970 --> 00:54:36.803
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see malfunctions sometimes when </v>

1068
00:54:38.611 --> 00:54:39.444
<v Speaker 1>people have these singular systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can develop a condition if you </v>

1069
00:54:42.181 --> 00:54:46.140
<v Speaker 1>have hypothalamic damage where you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll drink yourself,</v>

1070
00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:48.690
<v Speaker 1>you'll drink water until you die and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>one can stop you.</v>

1071
00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:49.883
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could lock you in a room away from </v>

1072
00:54:50.821 --> 00:54:52.410
<v Speaker 1>sinks and that would stop you.</v>

1073
00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:53.543
<v Speaker 1>But you'd be raging away inside trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to claw through the door to get to the </v>

1074
00:54:56.071 --> 00:54:56.904
<v Speaker 1>damn water because you're so hyper </v>
<v Speaker 1>thirsty that if it's all that there is </v>

1075
00:55:01.381 --> 00:55:04.530
<v Speaker 1>left of you in some sense that if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed access to a tab,</v>

1076
00:55:04.650 --> 00:55:05.483
<v Speaker 1>you'll just drink and drink and drink </v>
<v Speaker 1>and drink and drink and drink and drink </v>

1077
00:55:07.181 --> 00:55:09.360
<v Speaker 1>until you drown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1078
00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:10.680
<v Speaker 1>people can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1079
00:55:10.681 --> 00:55:11.514
<v Speaker 1>you've had enough water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like forget that the hypothalamus </v>

1080
00:55:14.701 --> 00:55:18.210
<v Speaker 1>is a major league system and when push </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to shove,</v>

1081
00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:19.133
<v Speaker 1>it's the thing that's in control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the ways of thinking about </v>

1082
00:55:22.051 --> 00:55:22.884
<v Speaker 1>the way that you organize your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life is that the hypothalamus </v>

1083
00:55:26.851 --> 00:55:30.030
<v Speaker 1>controls the major motivational systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>we just talked about those.</v>

1084
00:55:30.031 --> 00:55:32.790
<v Speaker 1>And so those are the things that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>would think about as drives,</v>

1085
00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:35.670
<v Speaker 1>although they're not drives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're too complicated to be drives.</v>

1086
00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:39.510
<v Speaker 1>And then there's other systems that come</v>
<v Speaker 1>up later that we'll also talk about that</v>

1087
00:55:39.511 --> 00:55:43.490
<v Speaker 1>or eat that govern emotion like anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1088
00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:45.600
<v Speaker 1>and a different system that governs </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain.</v>

1089
00:55:46.290 --> 00:55:49.980
<v Speaker 1>Partly what you're trying to do as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>organize your life is to make sure those</v>

1090
00:55:49.981 --> 00:55:52.650
<v Speaker 1>systems stay shut off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>

1091
00:55:52.651 --> 00:55:53.610
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in control.</v>

1092
00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:54.211
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1093
00:55:54.211 --> 00:55:55.044
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>

1094
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:59.550
<v Speaker 1>You just satisfied all of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that could take control from you.</v>

1095
00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:01.920
<v Speaker 1>And so now you have a modicum of choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

1096
00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:04.860
<v Speaker 1>and basically what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know of these things have had,</v>

1097
00:56:04.861 --> 00:56:06.650
<v Speaker 1>what they need is you're running around </v>
<v Speaker 1>and exploring,</v>

1098
00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:08.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

1099
00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:09.233
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also another one of these </v>

1100
00:56:10.201 --> 00:56:12.600
<v Speaker 1>circuits because the hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I already said,</v>

1101
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:13.830
<v Speaker 1>governance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration.</v>

1102
00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:19.180
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

1103
00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:23.410
<v Speaker 1>psychologists often get things backwards</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they ask silly questions.</v>

1104
00:56:23.411 --> 00:56:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are people anxious?</v>

1105
00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:27.550
<v Speaker 1>That's a stupid question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's how people,</v>

1106
00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:31.720
<v Speaker 1>why are people ever calm?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a question because like,</v>

1107
00:56:31.721 --> 00:56:33.160
<v Speaker 1>why are you anxious?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1108
00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:35.470
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take up all the terrible things that can</v>

1109
00:56:35.471 --> 00:56:38.230
<v Speaker 1>happen to you and they will happen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you even worse.</v>

1110
00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:39.720
<v Speaker 1>And there isn't anything you can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

1111
00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:40.573
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why aren't you quaking in your boots </v>

1112
00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:44.710
<v Speaker 1>just sitting there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a mystery,</v>

1113
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:46.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

1114
00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:48.070
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1115
00:56:48.310 --> 00:56:50.740
<v Speaker 1>here you are in your normal state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1116
00:56:50.741 --> 00:56:52.780
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a normal state.</v>

1117
00:56:53.110 --> 00:56:55.540
<v Speaker 1>People have been trying for,</v>

1118
00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:57.160
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1119
00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:01.810
<v Speaker 1>7 million years as people to create a </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

1120
00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:06.070
<v Speaker 1>So complex and comfortable that a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>of hundred of you can sit here,</v>

1121
00:57:06.310 --> 00:57:08.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without having your hypothalamus driving</v>

1122
00:57:08.831 --> 00:57:12.760
<v Speaker 1>you towards something and actually just </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to something for a few hours,</v>

1123
00:57:13.210 --> 00:57:16.820
<v Speaker 1>that's not normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so staggeringly abnormal that,</v>

1124
00:57:17.010 --> 00:57:18.010
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1125
00:57:18.011 --> 00:57:21.130
<v Speaker 1>it's a miracle that the typical person </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1126
00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:24.340
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for most of human history,</v>

1127
00:57:24.341 --> 00:57:28.630
<v Speaker 1>it's like you are hungry man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not the same like you people,</v>

1128
00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:30.550
<v Speaker 1>but some of you have probably been </v>
<v Speaker 1>hungry in your life.</v>

1129
00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:33.700
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the longest standing?</v>

1130
00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:36.490
<v Speaker 1>Is there someone here who's gone without</v>
<v Speaker 1>food for more than one day?</v>

1131
00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:38.623
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has Anybody here gone without food for </v>

1132
00:57:39.771 --> 00:57:42.800
<v Speaker 1>more than a week?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1133
00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:44.930
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about three days?</v>

1134
00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:48.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like are you hungry?</v>

1135
00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:49.973
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you're hungry when you haven't </v>

1136
00:57:51.421 --> 00:57:53.760
<v Speaker 1>had anything deep for 20 days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you were hungry,</v>

1137
00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:54.953
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1138
00:57:56.010 --> 00:57:56.843
<v Speaker 1>and the same goes for thirst and cold </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the things that were just never </v>

1139
00:57:59.911 --> 00:58:00.790
<v Speaker 1>exposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1140
00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:02.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think p civilized people are all calm</v>

1141
00:58:02.941 --> 00:58:04.560
<v Speaker 1>and nice and easy to get along with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1142
00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:06.640
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>

1143
00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:11.010
<v Speaker 1>you have absolutely everything you need </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

1144
00:58:11.011 --> 00:58:11.844
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that makes you as easy to get along </v>

1145
00:58:12.931 --> 00:58:15.840
<v Speaker 1>with his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any completely insane primate ever get.</v>

1146
00:58:16.530 --> 00:58:18.540
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1147
00:58:18.570 --> 00:58:21.090
<v Speaker 1>so the rent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

1148
00:58:21.091 --> 00:58:21.924
<v Speaker 1>well God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can survive with just the </v>

1149
00:58:23.071 --> 00:58:25.290
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what good is the rest of the brain?</v>

1150
00:58:26.070 --> 00:58:27.930
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1151
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:32.710
<v Speaker 1>if you're thirsty,</v>

1152
00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:35.200
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you're angry.</v>

1153
00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:37.240
<v Speaker 1>The hunger system is going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take care of that,</v>

1154
00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:38.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're hungry,</v>

1155
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:39.880
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that works.</v>

1156
00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:41.710
<v Speaker 1>You're angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that works.</v>

1157
00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:42.873
<v Speaker 1>But then you have another problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is you're hungry now when you're </v>

1158
00:58:45.341 --> 00:58:46.174
<v Speaker 1>angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now perhaps you can move through those </v>

1159
00:58:49.541 --> 00:58:50.890
<v Speaker 1>states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You watch that,</v>

1160
00:58:50.891 --> 00:58:51.724
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that in two year olds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's partly why they're so fun to be </v>

1161
00:58:53.501 --> 00:58:54.340
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1162
00:58:54.730 --> 00:58:56.020
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really excited.</v>

1163
00:58:56.021 --> 00:58:57.730
<v Speaker 1>They're running around playing and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1164
00:58:57.820 --> 00:58:59.740
<v Speaker 1>they trip and then they're crying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1165
00:58:59.741 --> 00:59:00.574
<v Speaker 1>And then you poke them and they laugh </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they want something to eat and </v>

1166
00:59:02.651 --> 00:59:05.140
<v Speaker 1>then they fall asleep and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>

1167
00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:06.153
<v Speaker 1>you're just running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're run by their hypothalamus and </v>

1168
00:59:07.901 --> 00:59:08.734
<v Speaker 1>it's really fun to see because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>so alive and so enthusiastic and </v>

1169
00:59:11.531 --> 00:59:14.080
<v Speaker 1>spontaneous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're completely clueless.</v>

1170
00:59:14.081 --> 00:59:17.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like you take one who throws his </v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures to the mall and leave it there</v>

1171
00:59:17.591 --> 00:59:19.600
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not happy at all.</v>

1172
00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:22.580
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1173
00:59:22.581 --> 00:59:24.650
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't know how to sequence any of </v>
<v Speaker 1>its actions,</v>

1174
00:59:24.651 --> 00:59:25.201
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It it,</v>

1175
00:59:25.201 --> 00:59:26.034
<v Speaker 1>it runs through the states of need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't complicated enough to </v>

1176
00:59:30.561 --> 00:59:31.394
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to address those needs in</v>
<v Speaker 1>any consistent sense across multiple </v>

1177
00:59:35.871 --> 00:59:37.940
<v Speaker 1>environments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a social world,</v>

1178
00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:39.740
<v Speaker 1>you need the rest of your brain for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1179
00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:41.053
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that again fits in with the </v>

1180
00:59:42.171 --> 00:59:43.004
<v Speaker 1>Piagetian idea is that what you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you're taking these micro </v>

1181
00:59:45.411 --> 00:59:49.970
<v Speaker 1>personalities that are basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantiated within the hypothalamus and</v>

1182
00:59:49.971 --> 00:59:50.804
<v Speaker 1>then you're organizing those into more </v>
<v Speaker 1>and more complex games and you need the </v>

1183
00:59:54.051 --> 00:59:54.884
<v Speaker 1>cortex to do that because the cortex is </v>
<v Speaker 1>partly what enables you just to think </v>

1184
00:59:58.881 --> 01:00:01.250
<v Speaker 1>about time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1185
01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:02.233
<v Speaker 1>because the hypothalamus is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's all right here and now thing </v>

1186
01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:07.910
<v Speaker 1>like the hypothalamic cat lives in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>

1187
01:00:07.911 --> 01:00:10.400
<v Speaker 1>there's thought present and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1188
01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.710
<v Speaker 1>you probably get some sense of that.</v>

1189
01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:13.993
<v Speaker 1>Like there are one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to people if they take </v>

1190
01:00:16.251 --> 01:00:18.440
<v Speaker 1>amphetamines or if they take psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>

1191
01:00:18.441 --> 01:00:23.441
<v Speaker 1>is that some of the inhibitory control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are complex control systems</v>

1192
01:00:24.411 --> 01:00:25.244
<v Speaker 1>that are critical shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then they enter a state where </v>

1193
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:34.040
<v Speaker 1>it's all now and you know the now just </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes at people in that state.</v>

1194
01:00:34.041 --> 01:00:35.780
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a transcendent experience.</v>

1195
01:00:35.781 --> 01:00:37.160
<v Speaker 1>But of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1196
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:38.503
<v Speaker 1>despite that you've not functional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in some sense you trade that </v>

1197
01:00:42.021 --> 01:00:45.650
<v Speaker 1>transcended relationship with reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a narrow functionality.</v>

1198
01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:48.560
<v Speaker 1>And that's too bad didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's life.</v>

1199
01:00:48.561 --> 01:00:49.400
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1200
01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:50.293
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1201
01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.100
<v Speaker 1>it's a tradeoff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1202
01:00:52.101 --> 01:00:52.934
<v Speaker 1>you're organizing these sub </v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities and you're using your </v>

1203
01:00:55.731 --> 01:00:56.564
<v Speaker 1>cortex to do that because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't just have to think about </v>

1204
01:00:58.911 --> 01:00:59.960
<v Speaker 1>eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to think about,</v>

1205
01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:03.020
<v Speaker 1>huh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how am I going to get the food?</v>

1206
01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:05.990
<v Speaker 1>When is the food going to come?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How am I going to cook the food?</v>

1207
01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:07.820
<v Speaker 1>What about all the other people don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to eat?</v>

1208
01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:09.013
<v Speaker 1>How do we regulate that in our family?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then how do we regulate that with </v>

1209
01:01:11.871 --> 01:01:14.780
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we also need to sleep and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to work and we need to get along</v>

1210
01:01:14.781 --> 01:01:17.270
<v Speaker 1>with other people and we need to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>something interesting to do.</v>

1211
01:01:17.271 --> 01:01:21.530
<v Speaker 1>And like it's ridiculously complicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it really doesn't,</v>

1212
01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:24.260
<v Speaker 1>there's no end to the complication </v>
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

1213
01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:26.993
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're just solving the problem </v>

1214
01:01:27.991 --> 01:01:32.190
<v Speaker 1>for you and then you're two or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to work it out within your</v>

1215
01:01:32.191 --> 01:01:33.024
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they have not sort of like the </v>

1216
01:01:34.201 --> 01:01:35.034
<v Speaker 1>crumb brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never get out of their family </v>

1217
01:01:36.061 --> 01:01:36.894
<v Speaker 1>because they just never come to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrangement that works well enough so </v>

1218
01:01:39.511 --> 01:01:40.311
<v Speaker 1>that they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1219
01:01:40.311 --> 01:01:42.210
<v Speaker 1>in some sense move into the broader </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1220
01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:43.463
<v Speaker 1>Then you solve the family problem with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you've got the like the tribe </v>

1221
01:01:45.631 --> 01:01:48.810
<v Speaker 1>problem and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can solve that to some degree,</v>

1222
01:01:48.811 --> 01:01:50.790
<v Speaker 1>but then you have the broader political </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

1223
01:01:50.791 --> 01:01:51.624
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an infinite number of problems </v>

1224
01:01:54.331 --> 01:01:55.164
<v Speaker 1>that crop up for you to solve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's plenty for you to do with </v>

1225
01:01:57.301 --> 01:01:59.060
<v Speaker 1>your big Cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1226
01:01:59.061 --> 01:02:02.280
<v Speaker 1>And we've paid a big price for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing because once we discovered time,</v>

1227
01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:05.143
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1228
01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:07.633
<v Speaker 1>we could make a bargain with the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is basically what you do when you </v>

1229
01:02:09.801 --> 01:02:13.190
<v Speaker 1>regulate your behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're making a bargain with the future.</v>

1230
01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:17.960
<v Speaker 1>You say to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I forego so and so now,</v>

1231
01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:21.090
<v Speaker 1>then later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh it'll pay off.</v>

1232
01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:24.630
<v Speaker 1>And that's real useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can conceptualize the future and you</v>

1233
01:02:24.631 --> 01:02:27.390
<v Speaker 1>can conceptualize the future as </v>
<v Speaker 1>something you can bargain with.</v>

1234
01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:30.110
<v Speaker 1>But there's a lot of cost to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is you can't,</v>

1235
01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:32.070
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to do just what you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

1236
01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:35.190
<v Speaker 1>Of course that socks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's partly why people drink alcohol,</v>

1237
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because alcohol's disinhibiting it stops</v>

1238
01:02:38.821 --> 01:02:41.940
<v Speaker 1>you from thinking it's the actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't stop you from thinking about the</v>

1239
01:02:41.941 --> 01:02:42.870
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>

1240
01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:43.943
<v Speaker 1>It stops you from caring about what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about the future and that's just </v>

1241
01:02:48.091 --> 01:02:48.924
<v Speaker 1>as good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you could go out and have </v>

1242
01:02:49.861 --> 01:02:51.380
<v Speaker 1>fun because fun is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1243
01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:55.470
<v Speaker 1>impulsive and often extremely dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the longterm consequences,</v>

1244
01:02:55.830 --> 01:02:57.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be really devastating,</v>

1245
01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:01.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's a real pain to keep yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled all the time,</v>

1246
01:03:01.021 --> 01:03:01.854
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you're for going direct reward </v>

1247
01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:06.480
<v Speaker 1>constantly.</v>

1248
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:07.783
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's part of the reason why </v>

1249
01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:13.290
<v Speaker 1>people in heavily industrialized complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries aren't necessarily happy.</v>

1250
01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:14.753
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1251
01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:16.373
<v Speaker 1>takes a lot of grinding away to keep all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the machinery that keeps all of this in </v>

1252
01:03:19.981 --> 01:03:21.390
<v Speaker 1>place going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1253
01:03:21.391 --> 01:03:23.250
<v Speaker 1>so you're not getting typhoid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>

1254
01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tigers aren't tearing you apart,</v>

1255
01:03:25.381 --> 01:03:26.214
<v Speaker 1>but by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be unbelievably disciplined </v>

1256
01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:30.473
<v Speaker 1>and ready to act constantly to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that's so complex around you </v>

1257
01:03:34.321 --> 01:03:36.570
<v Speaker 1>working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not necessarily fun.</v>

1258
01:03:37.290 --> 01:03:39.510
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1259
01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:44.720
<v Speaker 1>now let's look at something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can tell me if I,</v>

1260
01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:47.640
<v Speaker 1>if I showed you this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope I didn't show you this.</v>

1261
01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:04.020
<v Speaker 1>You see that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1262
01:04:04.021 --> 01:04:04.854
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now some of you know this and so you </v>

1263
01:04:06.781 --> 01:04:07.614
<v Speaker 1>just don't say anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although you probably don't know this </v>

1264
01:04:10.471 --> 01:04:13.440
<v Speaker 1>specific version.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to,</v>

1265
01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:14.880
<v Speaker 1>if you've seen this sort of thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

1266
01:04:14.881 --> 01:04:16.680
<v Speaker 1>you're going to think you're smart while</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're watching it,</v>

1267
01:04:16.681 --> 01:04:21.510
<v Speaker 1>but it'll probably still trip you off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>

1268
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:22.583
<v Speaker 1>Give me a sec here and all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if we can actually get some sound </v>

1269
01:04:31.381 --> 01:04:32.214
<v Speaker 1>out of this thing here.</v>

1270
01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:40.200
<v Speaker 2>The monkey business</v>
<v Speaker 2>count how many times the players wearing</v>

1271
01:04:40.871 --> 01:04:41.980
<v Speaker 2>white pass the ball?</v>

1272
01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:17.290
<v Speaker 1>The correct answer is 16.</v>

1273
01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:20.733
<v Speaker 2>Did you spot the gorilla</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people who haven't seen or heard </v>

1274
01:05:25.331 --> 01:05:28.780
<v Speaker 2>about a video like this before?</v>
<v Speaker 2>About half miss the gorilla.</v>

1275
01:05:32.130 --> 01:05:34.410
<v Speaker 2>If you knew about the gorilla,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably saw it,</v>

1276
01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:35.633
<v Speaker 2>but did you notice the curtain changing </v>
<v Speaker 2>color or the player on the black team </v>

1277
01:05:38.281 --> 01:05:39.114
<v Speaker 2>leaving the game?</v>

1278
01:05:48.370 --> 01:05:49.203
<v Speaker 1>You're comes the gorilla and there goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>a player and the curtain is changing </v>

1279
01:05:53.201 --> 01:05:54.070
<v Speaker 1>from red to gold.</v>

1280
01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:05.320
<v Speaker 2>What you're looking for a gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the monkey.</v>

1281
01:06:09.970 --> 01:06:13.240
<v Speaker 2>Learn more about this illusion and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>original gorilla experiment.</v>

1282
01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:15.250
<v Speaker 2>The invisible gorilla.com.</v>

1283
01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:22.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's quite,</v>

1284
01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:26.400
<v Speaker 1>that's quite the illustration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1285
01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:31.530
<v Speaker 1>one of the questions you might ask is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1286
01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:32.251
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1287
01:06:32.251 --> 01:06:35.970
<v Speaker 1>how many of you didn't see the gorilla?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1288
01:06:35.971 --> 01:06:38.310
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have seen this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>video before?</v>

1289
01:06:38.430 --> 01:06:39.263
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you knew about the damn brill of the </v>

1290
01:06:40.411 --> 01:06:42.720
<v Speaker 1>people who didn't know about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gorilla.</v>

1291
01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:46.550
<v Speaker 1>How many people didn't see the gorilla?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1292
01:06:46.551 --> 01:06:47.260
<v Speaker 1>some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1293
01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:49.170
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you got the other things?</v>

1294
01:06:50.610 --> 01:06:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1295
01:06:53.130 --> 01:06:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get the point.</v>

1296
01:06:54.541 --> 01:06:55.890
<v Speaker 1>The point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's brilliant,</v>

1297
01:06:56.610 --> 01:06:59.350
<v Speaker 1>it's an insanely brilliant experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1298
01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:01.973
<v Speaker 1>you're blind to a ridiculous degree and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your visual system and your brain are </v>

1299
01:07:08.371 --> 01:07:10.530
<v Speaker 1>constantly coping with the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're blind,</v>

1300
01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:11.543
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1301
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:13.530
<v Speaker 1>and you can kind of detect it to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>

1302
01:07:13.531 --> 01:07:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you pay attention to,</v>

1303
01:07:16.711 --> 01:07:19.380
<v Speaker 1>the things that surround them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that like,</v>

1304
01:07:19.381 --> 01:07:23.640
<v Speaker 1>so I'm looking at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see your nose for sure.</v>

1305
01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.800
<v Speaker 1>It's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even see your face.</v>

1306
01:07:26.130 --> 01:07:26.963
<v Speaker 1>I can see your glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see any features in your face </v>

1307
01:07:30.301 --> 01:07:32.250
<v Speaker 1>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you smile?</v>

1308
01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:36.940
<v Speaker 1>The one behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1309
01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:37.973
<v Speaker 1>well one of the things I've noticed when</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing this is that like if you look </v>

1310
01:07:40.111 --> 01:07:41.760
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at my finger,</v>

1311
01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:44.760
<v Speaker 1>but pay attention to my face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard.</v>

1312
01:07:44.761 --> 01:07:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Cause normally when you pay attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you move your eyes to what you're paying</v>

1313
01:07:47.221 --> 01:07:48.750
<v Speaker 1>attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1314
01:07:48.751 --> 01:07:49.584
<v Speaker 1>So here's what you might see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you might see is that </v>

1315
01:07:51.871 --> 01:07:52.704
<v Speaker 1>you can't see my notes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second thing you might see is that </v>

1316
01:07:56.071 --> 01:07:58.220
<v Speaker 1>you can really see my eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they moved.</v>

1317
01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:04.670
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so weird.</v>

1318
01:08:04.671 --> 01:08:06.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like all of a sudden these eyes </v>
<v Speaker 1>park.</v>

1319
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:09.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll try this too.</v>

1320
01:08:09.951 --> 01:08:10.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so look at my,</v>

1321
01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:15.910
<v Speaker 1>my finger again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can also see teeth.</v>

1322
01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

1323
01:08:18.170 --> 01:08:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Well if you're looking here and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something there with eyes and teeth,</v>

1324
01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:23.090
<v Speaker 1>you should probably be able to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1325
01:08:23.091 --> 01:08:26.570
<v Speaker 1>And so what that basically means is </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got this tiny little phobia,</v>

1326
01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:28.550
<v Speaker 1>which is right in the center of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>retina.</v>

1327
01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:29.533
<v Speaker 1>It's just densely packed with cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then those cells transmit </v>

1328
01:08:33.181 --> 01:08:37.130
<v Speaker 1>information along the optic nerve and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just connected like mad to cells</v>

1329
01:08:37.131 --> 01:08:40.460
<v Speaker 1>in the visual cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you don't have that much room.</v>

1330
01:08:40.461 --> 01:08:44.630
<v Speaker 1>So you can't connect all of the cells in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your retina to 10,000 cells.</v>

1331
01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Like at the first level of connection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to have a brain in this big,</v>

1332
01:08:47.931 --> 01:08:49.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't,</v>

1333
01:08:49.161 --> 01:08:50.110
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1334
01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:51.013
<v Speaker 1>you get by and part of the way you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>by as you're always moving your eyes </v>

1335
01:08:53.721 --> 01:08:54.440
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

1336
01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.420
<v Speaker 1>And so it looks like you can see </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

1337
01:08:56.530 --> 01:09:00.710
<v Speaker 1>but you can't in fact out here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I'm looking at you now,</v>

1338
01:09:00.711 --> 01:09:01.544
<v Speaker 1>I can tell him my hands were there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although if I didn't know they were </v>

1339
01:09:03.951 --> 01:09:05.510
<v Speaker 1>hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably couldn't figure it out.</v>

1340
01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:08.210
<v Speaker 1>They're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of blurry,</v>

1341
01:09:08.211 --> 01:09:10.910
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're in black and white,</v>

1342
01:09:11.450 --> 01:09:13.130
<v Speaker 1>but I can't tell that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1343
01:09:13.670 --> 01:09:16.130
<v Speaker 1>So out here it's like who cares what </v>
<v Speaker 1>color it is?</v>

1344
01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:17.113
<v Speaker 1>So you just don't see the color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know that you don't see </v>

1345
01:09:18.801 --> 01:09:19.634
<v Speaker 1>the color.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course I can have my hands </v>

1346
01:09:21.531 --> 01:09:22.364
<v Speaker 1>here and then I put him here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can hardly see them and then they're </v>

1347
01:09:24.561 --> 01:09:26.300
<v Speaker 1>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are so gone,</v>

1348
01:09:26.301 --> 01:09:28.220
<v Speaker 1>it's like they don't even exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even,</v>

1349
01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:29.173
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you'd think in some sense that </v>

1350
01:09:30.350 --> 01:09:32.780
<v Speaker 1>what was behind your head would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>black.</v>

1351
01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:36.050
<v Speaker 1>Like when you close your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's nothing.</v>

1352
01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:36.913
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1353
01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:40.580
<v Speaker 1>What you can't see behind your head is </v>
<v Speaker 1>so not there that it isn't,</v>

1354
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:42.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's literally,</v>

1355
01:09:44.570 --> 01:09:46.820
<v Speaker 1>it isn't even not there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all gone.</v>

1356
01:09:46.821 --> 01:09:48.230
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1357
01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:49.753
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So part of the way that your eyes work </v>

1358
01:09:50.901 --> 01:09:55.901
<v Speaker 1>is that the periphery is attached to </v>
<v Speaker 1>devices in some sense.</v>

1359
01:09:57.171 --> 01:09:59.930
<v Speaker 1>And some of them detect lines and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them detect movement.</v>

1360
01:10:00.170 --> 01:10:01.003
<v Speaker 1>You remember Jurassic Park don't move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dinosaur can't see you unless you </v>

1361
01:10:04.881 --> 01:10:05.750
<v Speaker 1>move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1362
01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:06.793
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frogs are like that and catch her like </v>

1363
01:10:09.081 --> 01:10:09.914
<v Speaker 1>that to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can really see things move this </v>

1364
01:10:11.751 --> 01:10:13.980
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Partly because their eyes are slid.</v>

1365
01:10:14.010 --> 01:10:17.090
<v Speaker 1>It makes it easier for them to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>things moving like this.</v>

1366
01:10:17.210 --> 01:10:19.130
<v Speaker 1>They're not so good at things moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

1367
01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:22.310
<v Speaker 1>Well it's because they chase mice right </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my smooth most mice,</v>

1368
01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:24.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except for like ones that haul,</v>

1369
01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:25.903
<v Speaker 1>they moved this way.</v>

1370
01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:26.943
<v Speaker 1>And so cats are specialized for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're also specialized to see </v>

1371
01:10:30.411 --> 01:10:31.244
<v Speaker 1>teeth and eyes because you want to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>if something's looking at you and you </v>

1372
01:10:35.091 --> 01:10:35.924
<v Speaker 1>want to know if it has teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means in part is that </v>

1373
01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:40.333
<v Speaker 1>the surrounding tissue in your eyes </v>
<v Speaker 1>reports to some degree to your visual </v>

1374
01:10:44.301 --> 01:10:45.134
<v Speaker 1>Cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what you use to actually have </v>

1375
01:10:47.031 --> 01:10:47.864
<v Speaker 1>conscious vision with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of it just dumps down into </v>

1376
01:10:50.061 --> 01:10:50.894
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the brain areas we haven't </v>

1377
01:10:51.591 --> 01:10:52.424
<v Speaker 1>talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily directly down to the </v>

1378
01:10:54.561 --> 01:10:57.380
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So though I suspect it has inputs there,</v>

1379
01:10:57.710 --> 01:10:58.543
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But your eyes talk to your spinal cord </v>

1380
01:11:01.670 --> 01:11:04.700
<v Speaker 1>directly so that you could see something</v>
<v Speaker 1>snake light.</v>

1381
01:11:04.701 --> 01:11:07.040
<v Speaker 1>For example in jump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like you're,</v>

1382
01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:09.170
<v Speaker 1>you jump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your hand touches a hot stove,</v>

1383
01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:11.590
<v Speaker 1>you don't even see the snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like snake jump.</v>

1384
01:11:12.230 --> 01:11:14.700
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is you waiting </v>
<v Speaker 1>around to see the snake.</v>

1385
01:11:14.701 --> 01:11:16.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's bitten you 15 times and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your dead.</v>

1386
01:11:16.770 --> 01:11:21.770
<v Speaker 1>So you can't wait around and see this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh look a snake and you jump.</v>

1387
01:11:22.141 --> 01:11:22.974
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1388
01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:25.570
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>

1389
01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:30.180
<v Speaker 1>your body has conserved all these layers</v>
<v Speaker 1>of reflex and movement all the way up to</v>

1390
01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:31.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher order,</v>

1391
01:11:31.741 --> 01:11:32.574
<v Speaker 1>voluntary movement because otherwise you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just wouldn't be fast enough when </v>

1392
01:11:35.011 --> 01:11:39.300
<v Speaker 1>something super fast happens and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way your eyes are built so your eyes</v>

1393
01:11:39.301 --> 01:11:42.540
<v Speaker 1>can tell your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body to jump if no vision,</v>

1394
01:11:42.570 --> 01:11:43.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just pattern,</v>

1395
01:11:43.950 --> 01:11:47.040
<v Speaker 1>snake pattern jump pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snake pattern,</v>

1396
01:11:47.041 --> 01:11:48.960
<v Speaker 1>retinal pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>optic nerve pattern,</v>

1397
01:11:48.961 --> 01:11:50.700
<v Speaker 1>brain pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle pattern,</v>

1398
01:11:50.970 --> 01:11:51.803
<v Speaker 1>no vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no seeing cause you don't need to see </v>

1399
01:11:54.211 --> 01:11:55.044
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to do pattern and pattern </v>

1400
01:11:55.861 --> 01:11:57.060
<v Speaker 1>matching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1401
01:11:57.061 --> 01:11:57.894
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird way of thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not much different than the </v>

1402
01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:00.990
<v Speaker 1>touching.</v>

1403
01:12:00.990 --> 01:12:02.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can feel the pattern,</v>

1404
01:12:04.290 --> 01:12:06.480
<v Speaker 1>you can build a three dimensional </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of it.</v>

1405
01:12:06.481 --> 01:12:07.314
<v Speaker 1>You can really see well with your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like the idea of that blind people </v>

1406
01:12:09.361 --> 01:12:10.194
<v Speaker 1>can't see as a really dopey idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't see color and they're not very </v>

1407
01:12:13.291 --> 01:12:15.090
<v Speaker 1>good at detecting things in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>distance,</v>

1408
01:12:15.330 --> 01:12:18.360
<v Speaker 1>but they have a visual world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just built out of things that don't</v>

1409
01:12:18.361 --> 01:12:19.650
<v Speaker 1>have color.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1410
01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:21.353
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know perfectly well that that's the </v>

1411
01:12:22.231 --> 01:12:23.970
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I could hand you an object and you</v>

1412
01:12:23.971 --> 01:12:25.740
<v Speaker 1>could fiddle around with it behind your </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

1413
01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:28.830
<v Speaker 1>And after some fiddling around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know exactly what it looked like.</v>

1414
01:12:29.490 --> 01:12:31.440
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might pull it out here and say,</v>

1415
01:12:31.441 --> 01:12:33.330
<v Speaker 1>well I didn't know it was blue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1416
01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:34.230
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1417
01:12:34.230 --> 01:12:36.090
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know it was blue but you still</v>

1418
01:12:36.091 --> 01:12:39.990
<v Speaker 1>saw it and you can get pretty God damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>good vision with your ears.</v>

1419
01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:43.260
<v Speaker 1>So there are kids who are blind who've </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned to echolocate.</v>

1420
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:45.060
<v Speaker 1>So they go click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

1421
01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.740
<v Speaker 1>click.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't make that noise.</v>

1422
01:12:46.741 --> 01:12:47.574
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they do click and they can detect </v>

1423
01:12:50.251 --> 01:12:53.040
<v Speaker 1>the clicks bouncing off of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they can do that well enough,</v>

1424
01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:53.903
<v Speaker 1>not only to walk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of them can actually ride </v>

1425
01:12:55.111 --> 01:12:56.520
<v Speaker 1>bikes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1426
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:58.430
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's impressive math.</v>

1427
01:12:58.890 --> 01:13:00.600
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what's that?</v>

1428
01:13:01.530 --> 01:13:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one kid,</v>

1429
01:13:02.491 --> 01:13:05.310
<v Speaker 1>I saw a kid on youtube who was blind who</v>
<v Speaker 1>could shoot baskets.</v>

1430
01:13:05.311 --> 01:13:06.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is fine.</v>

1431
01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Hey God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's impressive.</v>

1432
01:13:07.411 --> 01:13:08.690
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1433
01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:09.930
<v Speaker 1>my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

1434
01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the neural tissue is,</v>

1435
01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:15.690
<v Speaker 1>it'll take whatever input it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're born blind,</v>

1436
01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:16.703
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your auditory systems will invade your </v>

1437
01:13:18.961 --> 01:13:22.890
<v Speaker 1>visual system and then you have twice as</v>
<v Speaker 1>much brain devoted to your hearing.</v>

1438
01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:24.390
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>

1439
01:13:24.391 --> 01:13:26.130
<v Speaker 1>you can use that quite effectively.</v>

1440
01:13:26.130 --> 01:13:27.570
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

1441
01:13:27.571 --> 01:13:30.060
<v Speaker 1>So I think we're probably pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

1442
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:31.223
<v Speaker 1>The one thing I want to tell you before </v>
<v Speaker 1>we go on to the next part though is </v>

1443
01:13:33.271 --> 01:13:34.104
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now we've sort of built up the idea </v>

1444
01:13:36.571 --> 01:13:37.404
<v Speaker 1>of these underlying motivational systems</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now you can kind of see how they </v>

1445
01:13:41.221 --> 01:13:43.380
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say to yourself,</v>

1446
01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:48.860
<v Speaker 1>why didn't you see the gorilla?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the curtain and the person leaving.</v>

1447
01:13:49.770 --> 01:13:52.440
<v Speaker 1>It's really complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really complicated.</v>

1448
01:13:53.130 --> 01:13:57.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first answer is you did what I asked</v>

1449
01:13:58.890 --> 01:13:59.760
<v Speaker 1>and then you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1450
01:13:59.761 --> 01:14:01.860
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did you do what I asked?</v>

1451
01:14:01.861 --> 01:14:03.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you miss the damn gorilla,</v>

1452
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:04.103
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1453
01:14:04.230 --> 01:14:06.060
<v Speaker 1>obviously that wasn't a very good </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision.</v>

1454
01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:07.141
<v Speaker 1>So you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1455
01:14:07.141 --> 01:14:10.200
<v Speaker 1>why did you do what I asked?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer would be,</v>

1456
01:14:11.170 --> 01:14:12.003
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like the milgram obedience </v>

1457
01:14:13.421 --> 01:14:14.700
<v Speaker 1>experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except you know,</v>

1458
01:14:14.710 --> 01:14:16.480
<v Speaker 1>why don't we leverage lower level?</v>

1459
01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:19.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like we've got an agreement going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on here.</v>

1460
01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:22.690
<v Speaker 1>You guys are all very sophisticated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex game players.</v>

1461
01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:23.913
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you couldn't sit here </v>

1462
01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:27.790
<v Speaker 1>peacefully for an hour and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>

1463
01:14:27.850 --> 01:14:29.950
<v Speaker 1>you're very well socialized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of you.</v>

1464
01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:31.053
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that you've organized </v>
<v Speaker 1>all your motivations into a hierarchy </v>

1465
01:14:34.510 --> 01:14:35.343
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that hierarchy is guiding your </v>

1466
01:14:37.061 --> 01:14:38.680
<v Speaker 1>behavior here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be something like,</v>

1467
01:14:38.681 --> 01:14:39.910
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to learn something.</v>

1468
01:14:39.911 --> 01:14:40.744
<v Speaker 1>And hypothetically you've come here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn something and so you're </v>

1469
01:14:43.361 --> 01:14:47.260
<v Speaker 1>playing that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then because that's the motivational</v>

1470
01:14:47.261 --> 01:14:50.910
<v Speaker 1>state that you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I asked you to do something,</v>

1471
01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:52.570
<v Speaker 1>you're just going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

1472
01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:53.433
<v Speaker 1>Then what's so cool is that as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you decide to point your attention out </v>

1473
01:14:57.881 --> 01:14:58.714
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is what you see in the </v>

1474
01:15:01.331 --> 01:15:03.580
<v Speaker 1>world radically transforms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1475
01:15:03.581 --> 01:15:05.020
<v Speaker 1>So I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1476
01:15:05.021 --> 01:15:05.854
<v Speaker 1>count the basketballs and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden all you can see or basketballs </v>

1477
01:15:08.051 --> 01:15:08.651
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1478
01:15:08.651 --> 01:15:10.150
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see I'm not blind.</v>

1479
01:15:10.150 --> 01:15:11.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1480
01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:12.273
<v Speaker 1>you're pretty damn blind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's partly how you can </v>

1481
01:15:16.751 --> 01:15:19.300
<v Speaker 1>understand how motivation is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>subpersonality.</v>

1482
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:22.420
<v Speaker 1>Like it has its whole sets of </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptions and values.</v>

1483
01:15:22.421 --> 01:15:26.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like all of a sudden I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you open a little motivated state.</v>

1484
01:15:26.210 --> 01:15:27.730
<v Speaker 1>It was a complicated one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1485
01:15:27.731 --> 01:15:30.070
<v Speaker 1>but it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the task.</v>

1486
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:31.143
<v Speaker 1>And so you're all motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to do the task properly </v>

1487
01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:35.860
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for God only knows how many reasons.</v>

1488
01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:38.920
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden all that exists</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world are basketballs.</v>

1489
01:15:39.670 --> 01:15:41.920
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that,</v>

1490
01:15:41.990 --> 01:15:43.170
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it's,</v>

1491
01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:44.370
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's as if you're,</v>

1492
01:15:44.371 --> 01:15:45.204
<v Speaker 1>your goal directed attention has </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformed the phenomenology of the </v>

1493
01:15:48.191 --> 01:15:49.024
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's something that's really cool </v>

1494
01:15:50.291 --> 01:15:52.210
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that implies </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that</v>

1495
01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:56.080
<v Speaker 1>what you see of the world depends on </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're aiming at.</v>

1496
01:15:57.100 --> 01:15:59.860
<v Speaker 1>And in a real sense that this isn't some</v>
<v Speaker 1>trivial sense.</v>

1497
01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:02.650
<v Speaker 1>It means like literally what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>aiming at,</v>

1498
01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:05.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to count the basketballs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means,</v>

1499
01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:07.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not noticing the gorillas.</v>

1500
01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:10.270
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that you might ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself in this apartment,</v>

1501
01:16:10.271 --> 01:16:15.271
<v Speaker 1>what the phenomenologists were on about </v>
<v Speaker 1>is what he Ayman had and what is it that</v>

1502
01:16:16.871 --> 01:16:17.704
<v Speaker 1>what you're aiming at allows you to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what is it that what you're aiming </v>

1503
01:16:20.801 --> 01:16:21.634
<v Speaker 1>at blinds you to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it blinds you to a lot more than it </v>

1504
01:16:24.671 --> 01:16:25.504
<v Speaker 1>allows you to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so another thing that you can think </v>

1505
01:16:27.551 --> 01:16:28.384
<v Speaker 1>about is like if everything you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you angry and bitter and </v>

1506
01:16:30.251 --> 01:16:33.460
<v Speaker 1>resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you might think,</v>

1507
01:16:33.461 --> 01:16:36.430
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly am I aiming at?</v>

1508
01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:39.820
<v Speaker 1>This making the world organizes itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>around me in that manner.</v>

1509
01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:41.200
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1510
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:42.183
<v Speaker 1>that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be a complex from a union </v>

1511
01:16:44.201 --> 01:16:46.630
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a complex would do that.</v>

1512
01:16:46.631 --> 01:16:47.800
<v Speaker 1>So it's a set of values.</v>

1513
01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:49.930
<v Speaker 1>They're sort of economist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they inhabit you.</v>

1514
01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:52.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a sub personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite complex.</v>

1515
01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:55.090
<v Speaker 1>It's got something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's saving that you might not know even</v>

1516
01:16:55.091 --> 01:16:55.924
<v Speaker 1>what that is because you're acting it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out instead of understanding it and </v>

1517
01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:00.153
<v Speaker 1>because you're inside of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it lays the world out for you in a </v>

1518
01:17:03.221 --> 01:17:04.054
<v Speaker 1>particular way and it makes you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes the world looked like it's </v>

1519
01:17:06.161 --> 01:17:07.900
<v Speaker 1>showing you that what you think is </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1520
01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:10.940
<v Speaker 1>But it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1521
01:17:10.941 --> 01:17:11.774
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did they say to the man with a </v>

1522
01:17:12.591 --> 01:17:14.090
<v Speaker 1>hammer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything looks like a nail.</v>

1523
01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:15.800
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

1524
01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:16.693
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things that's so damn </v>

1525
01:17:18.051 --> 01:17:19.610
<v Speaker 1>cool about that experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1526
01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:22.100
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really that blind.</v>

1527
01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:27.220
<v Speaker 1>I could miss something that radical just</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm involved in some dopey task,</v>

1528
01:17:27.290 --> 01:17:29.630
<v Speaker 1>like counting basketballs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes me so blind to that.</v>

1529
01:17:29.631 --> 01:17:32.360
<v Speaker 1>It's almost beyond comprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1530
01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:34.460
<v Speaker 1>so in some ways you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1531
01:17:34.461 --> 01:17:37.310
<v Speaker 1>you skipped between different states of </v>
<v Speaker 1>blindness,</v>

1532
01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:39.170
<v Speaker 1>lot of them are biologically motivated.</v>

1533
01:17:40.130 --> 01:17:40.963
<v Speaker 1>Then you turn those into a hierarchy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of your higher value system </v>

1534
01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:44.293
<v Speaker 1>and then that thing points you at </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and the whole world lays </v>

1535
01:17:46.701 --> 01:17:47.534
<v Speaker 1>itself out around that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way it does is it divides the </v>

1536
01:17:49.941 --> 01:17:50.774
<v Speaker 1>world and do irrelevant things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those would've been the curtains </v>

1537
01:17:53.691 --> 01:17:54.524
<v Speaker 1>in this particular example or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gorilla or even a player in black lift </v>

1538
01:17:57.651 --> 01:18:01.040
<v Speaker 1>the game irrelevant because it didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>interfere with you counting.</v>

1539
01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:04.190
<v Speaker 1>So what you look at makes most of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world irrelevant.</v>

1540
01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:08.600
<v Speaker 1>It makes some things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that serve you and that makes you</v>

1541
01:18:08.601 --> 01:18:10.970
<v Speaker 1>feel positive emotion and it makes other</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

1542
01:18:10.971 --> 01:18:14.060
<v Speaker 1>things that get in your way and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes negative emotion.</v>

1543
01:18:14.570 --> 01:18:15.403
<v Speaker 1>And so you've got the hypothalamic </v>
<v Speaker 1>system that point you in biological </v>

1544
01:18:17.901 --> 01:18:22.220
<v Speaker 1>directions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you organize those and then it's like as</v>

1545
01:18:22.221 --> 01:18:23.054
<v Speaker 1>you were approaching the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're aiming at the positive emotion </v>

1546
01:18:25.821 --> 01:18:26.654
<v Speaker 1>systems tell you when you're on track </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the negative emotion systems tell </v>

1547
01:18:29.181 --> 01:18:30.410
<v Speaker 1>you when something's interfering.</v>

1548
01:18:30.650 --> 01:18:33.680
<v Speaker 1>And those are actually different </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurological systems.</v>

1549
01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:34.993
<v Speaker 1>So they're not in the hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The positive emotion system is to some </v>

1550
01:18:37.791 --> 01:18:39.980
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the negative emotion system,</v>

1551
01:18:39.981 --> 01:18:42.410
<v Speaker 1>not that evolved later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a couple of them.</v>

1552
01:18:42.450 --> 01:18:45.200
<v Speaker 1>There's one that produces pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk about it more.</v>

1553
01:18:45.201 --> 01:18:49.220
<v Speaker 1>And there's another one that produces </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and so awesome.</v>

1554
01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:50.113
<v Speaker 1>Now you kind of understand the relation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly the relationship between </v>

1555
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:55.400
<v Speaker 1>motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perception,</v>

1556
01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:57.550
<v Speaker 1>and emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1557
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:58.423
<v Speaker 1>they all act together and they're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent in this weird way in on what </v>

1558
01:19:02.871 --> 01:19:03.704
<v Speaker 1>you're after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you can think about that for 50 </v>

1559
01:19:06.141 --> 01:19:07.820
<v Speaker 1>years and you won't get to the bottom of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1560
01:19:07.821 --> 01:19:08.654
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Buddhists say that everything is </v>

1561
01:19:09.591 --> 01:19:10.460
<v Speaker 1>illusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maya.</v>

1562
01:19:10.461 --> 01:19:11.720
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People live in illusion.</v>

1563
01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:14.930
<v Speaker 1>Why is what you're aiming at determines </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you see.</v>

1564
01:19:16.190 --> 01:19:19.440
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worth it.</v>
