00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.500
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>

2
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.000
<v Speaker 1>So the first question that came up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3
00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:21.190
<v Speaker 1>there's something I want to say first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

4
00:00:21.191 --> 00:00:24.070
<v Speaker 1>thank you for tuning into this Q.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And.</v>

5
00:00:24.071 --> 00:00:26.200
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always much appreciated.</v>

6
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.953
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a pleasure to do these and they </v>

7
00:00:29.591 --> 00:00:32.170
<v Speaker 1>seem to be quite popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been a while since I did one,</v>

8
00:00:32.171 --> 00:00:33.004
<v Speaker 1>but I've been on the road a lot and away</v>
<v Speaker 1>from my computer and so that's the </v>

9
00:00:37.511 --> 00:00:42.040
<v Speaker 1>reason or the excuse take your pick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully it's a reason.</v>

10
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to let you know too,</v>

11
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.353
<v Speaker 1>those of you who don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have worked on two programs online </v>

12
00:00:50.771 --> 00:00:53.410
<v Speaker 1>that are hypothetically helpful to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

13
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.720
<v Speaker 1>One is self authoring Dotcom and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>helps you write about your past and your</v>

14
00:00:58.721 --> 00:01:01.230
<v Speaker 1>present and your future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

15
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.133
<v Speaker 1>to catch you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the past authoring program to </v>

16
00:01:03.971 --> 00:01:07.660
<v Speaker 1>identify your faults and virtues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the present authoring program.</v>

17
00:01:07.661 --> 00:01:08.494
<v Speaker 1>And to make a vision and to counter </v>
<v Speaker 1>vision for your future and to make an </v>

18
00:01:11.951 --> 00:01:13.120
<v Speaker 1>implementable plan.</v>

19
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.433
<v Speaker 1>They're writing exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I produced a 20% discount for all you q </v>

20
00:01:17.921 --> 00:01:18.754
<v Speaker 1>and a people today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you use the discount code </v>

21
00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:21.394
<v Speaker 1>august@selfauthoring.com,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can purchase the full set of </v>

22
00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:29.340
<v Speaker 1>programs for 20% off and you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tooth.</v>

23
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:30.174
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a two for one offer so you can </v>

24
00:01:31.181 --> 00:01:33.640
<v Speaker 1>share that with a friend as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

25
00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:34.474
<v Speaker 1>and then understand myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dot Com is a personality test site that </v>

26
00:01:37.511 --> 00:01:38.344
<v Speaker 1>enables you to get a big five readout of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your personality with each of the big </v>

27
00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:43.480
<v Speaker 1>five traits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extroversion,</v>

28
00:01:43.481 --> 00:01:45.040
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>

29
00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:49.150
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness and openness broken </v>
<v Speaker 1>down into their two aspects.</v>

30
00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:49.984
<v Speaker 1>So you can get a pretty comprehensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>view of your personality and that code </v>

31
00:01:52.841 --> 00:01:53.674
<v Speaker 1>is also August and that's in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>description of the video in case you </v>

32
00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:57.574
<v Speaker 1>forget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

33
00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're inclined,</v>

34
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.020
<v Speaker 1>you can use those codes and you can try </v>
<v Speaker 1>out those programs.</v>

35
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.600
<v Speaker 1>We know the future authoring program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

36
00:02:04.601 --> 00:02:07.930
<v Speaker 1>if university students do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the ones that are struggling,</v>

37
00:02:07.931 --> 00:02:08.764
<v Speaker 1>it produces quite a market increase in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their propensity to stay at university </v>

38
00:02:12.821 --> 00:02:13.990
<v Speaker 1>and to get better grades.</v>

39
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.930
<v Speaker 1>So the program seemed very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very effective.</v>

40
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.760
<v Speaker 1>So if you're trying to straighten out </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life,</v>

41
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.760
<v Speaker 1>then I would recommend the self </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoring program.</v>

42
00:02:21.761 --> 00:02:22.594
<v Speaker 1>And if you're trying to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself better or someone that you </v>

43
00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:26.860
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you could try understand myself.</v>

44
00:02:26.861 --> 00:02:30.340
<v Speaker 1>Dot Com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's that.</v>

45
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other announcement I suppose is that</v>

46
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.200
<v Speaker 1>I've done a tour now of about 65 cities </v>
<v Speaker 1>with tammy.</v>

47
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.213
<v Speaker 1>Somebody asked how she manages this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's exceptionally good at traveling </v>

48
00:02:42.071 --> 00:02:42.904
<v Speaker 1>and very low in neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank God for that because it's been a </v>

49
00:02:46.751 --> 00:02:50.260
<v Speaker 1>stressful time with lots of opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

50
00:02:50.261 --> 00:02:54.220
<v Speaker 1>And she likes to travel and so she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>very good at helping me manage this.</v>

51
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to hit about 40 more cities,</v>

52
00:02:57.071 --> 00:03:00.940
<v Speaker 1>40 or 50 more cities between now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of April next year,</v>

53
00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:05.941
<v Speaker 1>which is when I'm going to bring all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this touring to a close in September and</v>

54
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:06.844
<v Speaker 1>early October.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're doing 20 cities on the eastern </v>

55
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 1>seaboard of the United States.</v>

56
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 1>And then in October,</v>
<v Speaker 1>near the end of October,</v>

57
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 1>about 15 cities in the UK and northern </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>

58
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.690
<v Speaker 1>And then in February,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia and New Zealand.</v>

59
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.960
<v Speaker 1>And then in April,</v>
<v Speaker 1>March and April,</v>

60
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:28.460
<v Speaker 1>then the rest of Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

61
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 1>that's the plan anyways in perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be some side trips during those</v>

62
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.023
<v Speaker 1>times to other places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can find out about </v>

63
00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:40.510
<v Speaker 1>that@jordanbpeterson.com forward slash </v>
<v Speaker 1>events.</v>

64
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.490
<v Speaker 1>You're more than welcome to come to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>talks.</v>

65
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.970
<v Speaker 1>They've been very good events in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>estimation.</v>

66
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've really enjoyed them.</v>

67
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.533
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you I enjoy doing those talks</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I find them a lot less stressful </v>

68
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.370
<v Speaker 1>than talking to journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crowds are there,</v>

69
00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.413
<v Speaker 1>the individuals in the crowds are there </v>
<v Speaker 1>to come and listen to a serious </v>

70
00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:06.670
<v Speaker 1>discussion about how life might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>improved and they're very,</v>

71
00:04:06.671 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 1>very positive events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've been very happy to do them.</v>

72
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.700
<v Speaker 1>The Sam Harris Videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did four talks with Sam Harris.</v>

73
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.740
<v Speaker 1>Those are in preparation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We hope we'll have them out in August.</v>

74
00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:18.574
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's trying to come to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreement about how they should be </v>

75
00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:22.750
<v Speaker 1>released.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's rather complicated affair given how</v>

76
00:04:22.751 --> 00:04:26.230
<v Speaker 1>many people are involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think we're close to figuring that</v>

77
00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:27.360
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

78
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 1>there'll be 10 hours of tape talks for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sessions,</v>

79
00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:33.220
<v Speaker 1>two and a half hours each.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the talks were very,</v>

80
00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:35.230
<v Speaker 1>very productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see.</v>

81
00:04:35.231 --> 00:04:37.060
<v Speaker 1>The audiences seem to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

82
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.720
<v Speaker 1>react positively to them and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>very well attended.</v>

83
00:04:40.721 --> 00:04:43.600
<v Speaker 1>We had 8,500 people in Dublin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

84
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.620
<v Speaker 1>and about 6,500 in London.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those were very large crowds.</v>

85
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.873
<v Speaker 1>So that's very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 rules for life has sold about 2 </v>

86
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:53.583
<v Speaker 1>million copies now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for those of you who are </v>

87
00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:59.731
<v Speaker 1>mathematically Geek inclined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's 57 miles of bookshelf.</v>

88
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:01.740
<v Speaker 1>If the books are stacked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

89
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you would put books on a bookshelf.</v>

90
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.020
<v Speaker 1>So that's a lot of books and maps of </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>

91
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.710
<v Speaker 1>I released the Audio version of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>June 12th,</v>

92
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.860
<v Speaker 1>2018 and it hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did it hit the New York Times bestseller</v>

93
00:05:14.861 --> 00:05:19.861
<v Speaker 1>list for audio books in July and August.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was rather comical given that 12</v>

94
00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:24.130
<v Speaker 1>rules for life was never put on the New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York Times bestseller list.</v>

95
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.173
<v Speaker 1>So I thought that was an ironic little </v>
<v Speaker 1>touch of fate and I'm quite pleased to </v>

96
00:05:29.081 --> 00:05:32.680
<v Speaker 1>see how the audio book is doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you like 12 rules for life and you're</v>

97
00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:36.190
<v Speaker 1>looking for something that delves more </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply into the same themes,</v>

98
00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:39.820
<v Speaker 1>then you could try maps of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the audio book,</v>

99
00:05:39.821 --> 00:05:42.550
<v Speaker 1>which I read is more accessible than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>written book.</v>

100
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.843
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people seem to be responding to it that </v>

101
00:05:45.221 --> 00:05:46.054
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm pretty happy about all the </v>

102
00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:50.860
<v Speaker 1>positive things that are happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

103
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.100
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

104
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.290
<v Speaker 1>How am I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the first question.</v>

105
00:05:56.291 --> 00:05:57.770
<v Speaker 1>How am I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

106
00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:59.383
<v Speaker 1>pretty good.</v>

107
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.853
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My health seems to have stabilized </v>

108
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:04.310
<v Speaker 1>substantially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm feeling pretty sharp.</v>

109
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have periods of some negative mood,</v>

110
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.940
<v Speaker 1>although they're short and sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

111
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.310
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm seem to be sharp cognitively and</v>

112
00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:18.860
<v Speaker 1>I can concentrate for long periods of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and get lots done.</v>

113
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.920
<v Speaker 1>I've been able to do quite a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing in the last couple of months,</v>

114
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.350
<v Speaker 1>partly blog posts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly.</v>

115
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:25.184
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the privilege of being asked to </v>

116
00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:32.180
<v Speaker 1>write the introduction to the 50th </v>
<v Speaker 1>anniversary version,</v>

117
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:33.343
<v Speaker 1>single volume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>abridged version of soldier Knutson's </v>

118
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.953
<v Speaker 1>Gulag archipelago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I finished that about a week and a </v>

119
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.760
<v Speaker 1>half ago that took me about two months </v>
<v Speaker 1>to write,</v>

120
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 3,500 words,</v>

121
00:06:43.761 --> 00:06:44.594
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a daunting task to write an </v>

122
00:06:47.601 --> 00:06:52.560
<v Speaker 1>introduction to a book as tremendously </v>
<v Speaker 1>influential and um,</v>

123
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.103
<v Speaker 1>and important and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also have exceedingly high literary </v>

124
00:06:58.641 --> 00:06:59.474
<v Speaker 1>quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was a daunting task to write that </v>

125
00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:02.354
<v Speaker 1>introduction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I really wanted to get it right and </v>

126
00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:04.814
<v Speaker 1>I hope I did.</v>

127
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:10.070
<v Speaker 1>I spoke by email with Solzhenitsyn's </v>
<v Speaker 1>family and they seem pleased with it and</v>

128
00:07:10.071 --> 00:07:14.000
<v Speaker 1>so did the editor and I've had a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>of editors including Gregg Hurwitz,</v>

129
00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:14.834
<v Speaker 1>my novelist friend from</v>
<v Speaker 1>La who's an absolutely vicious editor </v>

130
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:24.320
<v Speaker 1>and extremely good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were happy with the final cut,</v>

131
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.730
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So was I.</v>

132
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.200
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

133
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.320
<v Speaker 1>I seem to be sharp enough to do the work</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's necessary to do.</v>

134
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.260
<v Speaker 1>I've been working hard on the online </v>
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>

135
00:07:33.261 --> 00:07:37.010
<v Speaker 1>I've got three people hired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all very smart young guys.</v>

136
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:38.303
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're about a year ahead of where I </v>

137
00:07:40.431 --> 00:07:41.264
<v Speaker 1>thought we'd be at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We hope to have a minimally viable </v>

138
00:07:43.221 --> 00:07:48.221
<v Speaker 1>product sometime in the late fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm funding that entirely at the moment,</v>

139
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.560
<v Speaker 1>courtesy primarily of my Patriot </v>
<v Speaker 1>support.</v>

140
00:07:51.561 --> 00:07:54.170
<v Speaker 1>So thank you to all my patrion </v>
<v Speaker 1>supporters for that.</v>

141
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:55.063
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully your money's being put to good</v>
<v Speaker 1>use will probably crowdfunded in </v>

142
00:07:57.891 --> 00:07:58.724
<v Speaker 1>November to see if we can set up enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>capital for the next three or four </v>

143
00:08:01.431 --> 00:08:02.264
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

144
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could raise money privately.</v>

145
00:08:04.221 --> 00:08:06.290
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of people are interested in</v>
<v Speaker 1>investing,</v>

146
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.290
<v Speaker 1>but I think that I'm going to try </v>
<v Speaker 1>crowdfunding because,</v>

147
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:11.383
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'd like this to be a public </v>

148
00:08:12.411 --> 00:08:14.130
<v Speaker 1>enterprise from the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan,</v>

149
00:08:14.131 --> 00:08:14.964
<v Speaker 1>to have lots of people involved and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're thinking of all sorts of ways of </v>

150
00:08:17.091 --> 00:08:19.190
<v Speaker 1>getting people involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How am I,</v>

151
00:08:19.191 --> 00:08:24.191
<v Speaker 1>other than that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well nonplussed and still feeling rather</v>

152
00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:26.330
<v Speaker 1>surreal about my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

153
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my family is in good shape.</v>

154
00:08:29.331 --> 00:08:31.760
<v Speaker 1>My daughter who was very ill is doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely,</v>

155
00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:32.594
<v Speaker 1>extremely well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's miraculous as far as I'm </v>

156
00:08:35.391 --> 00:08:37.880
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My son's getting married in September,</v>

157
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:42.020
<v Speaker 1>that's Julian and I like his fiance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank God for that.</v>

158
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.570
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're looking forward to that.</v>

159
00:08:44.571 --> 00:08:47.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm going on a bit of a vacation during </v>
<v Speaker 1>August,</v>

160
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:48.463
<v Speaker 1>which is the first time I've had off for</v>
<v Speaker 1>about two years with the exception of </v>

161
00:08:51.981 --> 00:08:52.814
<v Speaker 1>one week last year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to a family reunion and </v>

162
00:08:55.831 --> 00:08:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Vancouver Island and then to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Saskatchewan to see my family.</v>

163
00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.080
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do two talks in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Saskatchewan while I'm there,</v>

164
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:05.670
<v Speaker 1>one in Saskatoon and one in Regina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I have a lot of family coming to the</v>

165
00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:06.504
<v Speaker 1>one in Saskatoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that and then a little reunion after </v>

166
00:09:09.001 --> 00:09:10.170
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that should be cool.</v>

167
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.360
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

168
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.370
<v Speaker 1>that's how I am and I'm thinking hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the next book.</v>

169
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:21.000
<v Speaker 1>I have a new book contract about to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>finalized,</v>

170
00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:24.660
<v Speaker 1>I think in the next week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping to release the next book,</v>

171
00:09:24.661 --> 00:09:26.960
<v Speaker 1>which will be 12 more rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

172
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:28.913
<v Speaker 1>probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

173
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:29.813
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond mere order is that tentative </v>

174
00:09:31.621 --> 00:09:32.454
<v Speaker 1>subtitle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping that I'll have it done by </v>

175
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.690
<v Speaker 1>spring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early,</v>

176
00:09:36.691 --> 00:09:39.780
<v Speaker 1>early spring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps January of 2020,</v>

177
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.033
<v Speaker 1>if not one year later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to try hard to hit it so </v>

178
00:09:44.161 --> 00:09:44.994
<v Speaker 1>that I'm done by next September.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to write nonstop from May to </v>

179
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.393
<v Speaker 1>September.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I plan to do biblical lectures </v>

180
00:09:51.331 --> 00:09:52.164
<v Speaker 1>from September through December.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the plan is to tour from January </v>

181
00:09:58.350 --> 00:09:59.250
<v Speaker 1>through May,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially</v>

182
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:05.580
<v Speaker 1>then to write for four months then to </v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture to prepare the biblical lectures</v>

183
00:10:05.581 --> 00:10:08.070
<v Speaker 1>and so forth for four months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that should be next year.</v>

184
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.640
<v Speaker 1>So that's an update.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

185
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.090
<v Speaker 1>hopefully that's all useful information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

186
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:20.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm very pleased about all the support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite remarkable.</v>

187
00:10:20.031 --> 00:10:21.340
<v Speaker 1>All this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

188
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:26.030
<v Speaker 1>interest in these complicated matters </v>
<v Speaker 1>and complicated discussions.</v>

189
00:10:26.031 --> 00:10:26.864
<v Speaker 1>And it's so nice to see people </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrating on psychological and </v>

190
00:10:30.051 --> 00:10:35.051
<v Speaker 1>philosophical issues and leaving the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idiot politics as far behind as possible</v>

191
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.370
<v Speaker 1>because it's certainly a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

192
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:38.593
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a distraction and a dangerous one at </v>

193
00:10:41.301 --> 00:10:42.134
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's so funny talking to the </v>

194
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.033
<v Speaker 1>mainstream media types because </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything they talk about has to be </v>

195
00:10:49.401 --> 00:10:52.910
<v Speaker 1>viewed through a political lens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I continue to insist,</v>

196
00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:56.390
<v Speaker 1>I did BBC hard talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was aired today,</v>

197
00:10:56.391 --> 00:10:57.224
<v Speaker 1>and that was a classic example of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interviewer being entirely scripted and </v>

198
00:11:00.801 --> 00:11:03.590
<v Speaker 1>trying to push everything that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening around me,</v>

199
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:04.573
<v Speaker 1>I suppose into a political narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't political as far as I'm </v>

200
00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:08.834
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Everything is political despite the </v>

201
00:11:10.611 --> 00:11:15.050
<v Speaker 1>insistence of people who feel that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal is always political.</v>

202
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.943
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

203
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.340
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's philosophical domain.</v>

204
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.193
<v Speaker 1>A theological domain in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological domain though should be </v>

205
00:11:21.531 --> 00:11:24.440
<v Speaker 1>kept the hell separate from politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

206
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:30.790
<v Speaker 1>What can a too agreeable young woman do </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be more disagreeable and assertive if</v>

207
00:11:31.251 --> 00:11:33.830
<v Speaker 1>that isn't how she is temperamentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>inclined?</v>

208
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

209
00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:36.194
<v Speaker 1>And I would say first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very common question that </v>

210
00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:40.603
<v Speaker 1>people who go into psychotherapy ask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the most common problem that </v>

211
00:11:45.651 --> 00:11:46.484
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapists deal with apart from </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and depression is probably </v>

212
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.010
<v Speaker 1>assertiveness training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

213
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.590
<v Speaker 1>so the thing I would say is you really </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to figure out what you want.</v>

214
00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.113
<v Speaker 1>And I would recommend doing the self </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoring program and the future </v>

215
00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:04.090
<v Speaker 1>authoring program in particular because </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to stand up for yourself,</v>

216
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:09.390
<v Speaker 1>you have to have your goals and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>vision well laid out and well defined.</v>

217
00:12:09.851 --> 00:12:12.550
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to have a strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

218
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:16.270
<v Speaker 1>that that is matched to those goals so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can,</v>

219
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.930
<v Speaker 1>so that you know what you want so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when you're not getting it.</v>

220
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:25.390
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you're left with a vague sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>of dissatisfaction and resentment.</v>

221
00:12:25.391 --> 00:12:27.610
<v Speaker 1>And that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult thing to articulate.</v>

222
00:12:27.611 --> 00:12:30.550
<v Speaker 1>And if you can't articulate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can't negotiate.</v>

223
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.100
<v Speaker 1>If you know what you want and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

224
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:35.440
<v Speaker 1>then you can make a case for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

225
00:12:35.441 --> 00:12:39.370
<v Speaker 1>So let's assume now that you've laid out</v>
<v Speaker 1>a vision and a counter vision,</v>

226
00:12:39.371 --> 00:12:41.590
<v Speaker 1>which the future authoring program also </v>
<v Speaker 1>helps you do.</v>

227
00:12:41.591 --> 00:12:43.750
<v Speaker 1>So you know what kind of hell you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to avoid,</v>

228
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:47.440
<v Speaker 1>that you might drift into if you were to</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeable for the rest of your life.</v>

229
00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:51.280
<v Speaker 1>And that would be a hell that consisted </v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly of people taking advantage of you</v>

230
00:12:51.281 --> 00:12:53.650
<v Speaker 1>all the time and you feeling resentful </v>
<v Speaker 1>and bitter about it.</v>

231
00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.360
<v Speaker 1>Not something I would recommend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

232
00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:00.190
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that women are agreeable because</v>

233
00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.413
<v Speaker 1>it helps them deal with infants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a great temperamental </v>

234
00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:09.630
<v Speaker 1>strategy for dealing with complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations in,</v>

235
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:11.200
<v Speaker 1>in the adult world.</v>

236
00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.970
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's a price that women pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

237
00:13:12.971 --> 00:13:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Also being adapted to have plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 1>patients for very young children.</v>

238
00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:18.663
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to overcome that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree to put yourself forward </v>

239
00:13:22.271 --> 00:13:25.780
<v Speaker 1>properly in more complex hierarchies of </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplishment.</v>

240
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.920
<v Speaker 1>So I would say once you have your vision</v>
<v Speaker 1>established,</v>

241
00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.990
<v Speaker 1>your vision for the future and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>counter vision,</v>

242
00:13:31.991 --> 00:13:34.900
<v Speaker 1>so you're afraid of what will happen if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't stand up for yourself,</v>

243
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:37.990
<v Speaker 1>then you need to consult your resentment</v>
<v Speaker 1>fig.</v>

244
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're resentful about </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

245
00:13:39.851 --> 00:13:42.460
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's generally only two reasons.</v>

246
00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.670
<v Speaker 1>One is you should grow the hell up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>quit whining,</v>

247
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:46.623
<v Speaker 1>so you've got to find out first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're just feeling sorry for </v>

248
00:13:48.371 --> 00:13:52.600
<v Speaker 1>yourself and you can think that through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a pro and con case and you can talk</v>

249
00:13:52.601 --> 00:13:54.310
<v Speaker 1>to somebody that you care about about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

250
00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm not assuming that that's the reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's one potential reason.</v>

251
00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.030
<v Speaker 1>If you're not merely feeling sorry for </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

252
00:14:01.031 --> 00:14:04.900
<v Speaker 1>then you probably have something to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>and something that you need and you need</v>

253
00:14:04.901 --> 00:14:05.734
<v Speaker 1>to figure out what that is and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to develop a strategy to to put </v>

254
00:14:08.501 --> 00:14:09.334
<v Speaker 1>that forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen lots of people in my personal </v>

255
00:14:12.281 --> 00:14:16.180
<v Speaker 1>life and in my private practice not get </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they want because,</v>

256
00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:16.691
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

257
00:14:16.691 --> 00:14:19.480
<v Speaker 1>they don't specify it and B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't ask for it.</v>

258
00:14:19.481 --> 00:14:22.730
<v Speaker 1>And if you're negotiating safe for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>razor,</v>

259
00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:25.630
<v Speaker 1>for a promotion and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to put yourself forward.</v>

260
00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:28.240
<v Speaker 1>You need to tell your the person you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>working for,</v>

261
00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.313
<v Speaker 1>why you should be treated with more </v>
<v Speaker 1>consideration or respect or have more </v>

262
00:14:33.701 --> 00:14:36.100
<v Speaker 1>resources devoted to your more </v>
<v Speaker 1>authority.</v>

263
00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what shifted to you?</v>

264
00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:39.723
<v Speaker 1>And you have to make a case for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a compelling case so that they have a </v>

265
00:14:42.611 --> 00:14:43.960
<v Speaker 1>reason to attend to you.</v>

266
00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:47.650
<v Speaker 1>And that's not going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to notice because most</v>

267
00:14:47.651 --> 00:14:50.860
<v Speaker 1>managerial types are so overloaded with </v>
<v Speaker 1>work that they never,</v>

268
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:52.003
<v Speaker 1>when anything's going right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just notice the things that are </v>

269
00:14:54.531 --> 00:14:57.050
<v Speaker 1>going wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need to make a plan,</v>

270
00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.080
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a strategy that goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>along with that plan.</v>

271
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:01.063
<v Speaker 1>You have to have articulated arguments </v>
<v Speaker 1>for why certain a certain form of </v>

272
00:15:05.361 --> 00:15:09.500
<v Speaker 1>treatment is appropriate to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to have the courage to</v>

273
00:15:09.501 --> 00:15:10.334
<v Speaker 1>put that forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess you have to remember that </v>

274
00:15:13.071 --> 00:15:16.430
<v Speaker 1>you owe yourself as much as you owe </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

275
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:19.920
<v Speaker 1>You have to take care of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you take care of other people and,</v>

276
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:22.880
<v Speaker 1>and that's a moral duty and if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice that,</v>

277
00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:25.370
<v Speaker 1>you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that has a lot of,</v>

278
00:15:25.371 --> 00:15:27.440
<v Speaker 1>that's also associated with telling the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

279
00:15:27.441 --> 00:15:28.274
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a better friend than the </v>

280
00:15:29.181 --> 00:15:30.014
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it can be very harsh in the </v>

281
00:15:30.891 --> 00:15:31.724
<v Speaker 1>short term.</v>

282
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:35.750
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're unhappy at work because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're being taken advantage of,</v>

283
00:15:35.751 --> 00:15:36.584
<v Speaker 1>then you have to strategize yourself out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that and you have to learn to </v>

284
00:15:38.361 --> 00:15:39.194
<v Speaker 1>negotiate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that also means that you </v>

285
00:15:41.271 --> 00:15:44.420
<v Speaker 1>have to overcome your hesitancy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>engage in conflict.</v>

286
00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.190
<v Speaker 1>And you've got to think about it this </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

287
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:48.733
<v Speaker 1>Negotiation and conflict are somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>indistinguishable and it's easy moment </v>

288
00:15:54.561 --> 00:15:55.394
<v Speaker 1>to moment to avoid negotiation conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you pay a terrible price for it in </v>

289
00:15:58.371 --> 00:15:59.204
<v Speaker 1>the medium to long term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better to face the conflict </v>

290
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:06.620
<v Speaker 1>forthrightly in the present and make </v>
<v Speaker 1>peace for the medium to long term.</v>

291
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.300
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's courage in that.</v>

292
00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:12.440
<v Speaker 1>So that's the other thing I would say is</v>
<v Speaker 1>gird up your loins and,</v>

293
00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:13.700
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

294
00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:14.923
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

295
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:18.530
<v Speaker 1>allow yourself to act courageously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>courageously.</v>

296
00:16:18.531 --> 00:16:19.364
<v Speaker 1>And truthfully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth is your best bet if you're too </v>

297
00:16:21.291 --> 00:16:23.060
<v Speaker 1>agreeable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

298
00:16:23.061 --> 00:16:25.700
<v Speaker 1>you also might find that you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty good critical intelligence,</v>

299
00:16:25.701 --> 00:16:28.610
<v Speaker 1>but that you think it's mean and so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you keep it hidden.</v>

300
00:16:28.611 --> 00:16:30.770
<v Speaker 1>Some of the smartest women I knew who </v>
<v Speaker 1>were very,</v>

301
00:16:30.771 --> 00:16:31.604
<v Speaker 1>very agreeable had unbelievably good </v>
<v Speaker 1>instincts with regards to figuring out </v>

302
00:16:35.571 --> 00:16:36.404
<v Speaker 1>what other people's motives were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were ashamed of their </v>

303
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:39.703
<v Speaker 1>suspicions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And really what that meant was they </v>

304
00:16:41.391 --> 00:16:42.224
<v Speaker 1>ended up being ashamed of their critical</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence because they were so </v>

305
00:16:44.481 --> 00:16:45.314
<v Speaker 1>agreeable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it may be that the darker part of </v>

306
00:16:48.051 --> 00:16:50.030
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shadow part of you knows things that</v>

307
00:16:50.031 --> 00:16:52.550
<v Speaker 1>you could know if you are willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>admit that they were true.</v>

308
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.520
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to give some credence to</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

309
00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.310
<v Speaker 1>to your darker element,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

310
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:14.193
<v Speaker 1>How do you know if you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating with the actual person or </v>

311
00:17:16.781 --> 00:17:17.614
<v Speaker 1>a mask?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sometimes wonder if I can ever really </v>

312
00:17:19.511 --> 00:17:21.340
<v Speaker 1>know someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

313
00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:25.660
<v Speaker 1>you can't ever thoroughly know someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>because people are too complicated.</v>

314
00:17:25.661 --> 00:17:26.494
<v Speaker 1>You can't even really know yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you know if you're communicating </v>

315
00:17:29.141 --> 00:17:31.180
<v Speaker 1>with the actual person or a mask?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

316
00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:33.670
<v Speaker 1>if you're communicating with an actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

317
00:17:33.671 --> 00:17:35.590
<v Speaker 1>then you're actually having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

318
00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:36.873
<v Speaker 1>You know when the conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>transforms as a consequence of </v>

319
00:17:39.761 --> 00:17:43.060
<v Speaker 1>participating in it and it tends to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>engaging and meaningful.</v>

320
00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:47.680
<v Speaker 1>If what's happening is an exchange of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological platitudes or,</v>

321
00:17:47.681 --> 00:17:50.340
<v Speaker 1>or just platitudes themselves for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter,</v>

322
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.680
<v Speaker 1>then you're probably engaging with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mask.</v>

323
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:58.020
<v Speaker 1>So if the conversation is compelling and</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful and it transforms as it as it</v>

324
00:17:58.021 --> 00:17:58.854
<v Speaker 1>progresses and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can see that give and take that </v>

325
00:18:01.411 --> 00:18:02.730
<v Speaker 1>dance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like give and take,</v>

326
00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:05.160
<v Speaker 1>then you're communicating with an actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

327
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:06.323
<v Speaker 1>The other thing I would say is that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're communicating with an actual </v>

328
00:18:09.061 --> 00:18:09.894
<v Speaker 1>person rather than a mask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person that you're communicating </v>

329
00:18:12.811 --> 00:18:15.450
<v Speaker 1>with tends to be quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

330
00:18:15.451 --> 00:18:16.284
<v Speaker 1>if people talk about what they know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means you're really communicating </v>

331
00:18:19.201 --> 00:18:20.034
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they talk about their own personal </v>

332
00:18:21.391 --> 00:18:22.224
<v Speaker 1>experience instead of wandering off into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the domain of cliches and ideological </v>

333
00:18:27.241 --> 00:18:28.074
<v Speaker 1>platitudes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then people tend to be extraordinarily </v>

334
00:18:30.001 --> 00:18:30.834
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's another good tactic and a </v>

335
00:18:35.011 --> 00:18:35.844
<v Speaker 1>good hint that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're where you should be when </v>

336
00:18:37.471 --> 00:18:41.160
<v Speaker 1>you're conversing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the rules I had when I was seeing</v>

337
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:42.203
<v Speaker 1>clients actively was that if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation I was having wasn't </v>

338
00:18:45.841 --> 00:18:48.480
<v Speaker 1>interesting and if my attention started </v>
<v Speaker 1>to wonder,</v>

339
00:18:48.481 --> 00:18:49.314
<v Speaker 1>then we weren't discussing issues that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were sufficiently vital because if we </v>

340
00:18:53.221 --> 00:18:58.020
<v Speaker 1>were discussing vital issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the conversation basically flew by.</v>

341
00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:00.870
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that's a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good marker.</v>

342
00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:07.743
<v Speaker 1>What new wisdom have you acquired in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>past few months that you want to share </v>

343
00:19:10.211 --> 00:19:11.200
<v Speaker 1>it with us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

344
00:19:11.201 --> 00:19:12.034
<v Speaker 1>I've got one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I thought thought up a bunch of </v>

345
00:19:14.081 --> 00:19:16.120
<v Speaker 1>new things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this one I'm really happy with.</v>

346
00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.530
<v Speaker 1>I figured out why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

347
00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:21.753
<v Speaker 1>some of you know that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological trope that I discussed </v>

348
00:19:25.441 --> 00:19:26.274
<v Speaker 1>fairly frequently about rescuing your </v>
<v Speaker 1>father from the belly of the dragon or </v>

349
00:19:29.591 --> 00:19:30.424
<v Speaker 1>the belly of the beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a motif that you see when you see </v>

350
00:19:33.461 --> 00:19:35.070
<v Speaker 1>it in the lion king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

351
00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:39.000
<v Speaker 1>you see it when Simba is being initiated</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the baboons.</v>

352
00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:39.853
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember Nephi Fiki I think his </v>

353
00:19:41.621 --> 00:19:42.910
<v Speaker 1>name is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

354
00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:47.530
<v Speaker 1>after Nela humiliates him because he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>still a pathetic adolescent.</v>

355
00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:52.150
<v Speaker 1>He follows the baboons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a mandrill actually,</v>

356
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:55.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>down underground,</v>

357
00:19:55.361 --> 00:19:56.194
<v Speaker 1>essentially through a long tunnel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of kind of scary music in </v>

358
00:19:58.571 --> 00:20:02.770
<v Speaker 1>the background and he ends up </v>
<v Speaker 1>contemplating himself in a dark pool and</v>

359
00:20:02.771 --> 00:20:04.660
<v Speaker 1>then his father appears in the sky.</v>

360
00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:05.733
<v Speaker 1>And so that's one example of the re </v>
<v Speaker 1>construction of the mythology of </v>

361
00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:14.530
<v Speaker 1>encountering your father in the abyss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look into the abyss and you see your</v>

362
00:20:14.531 --> 00:20:16.870
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in the Pinocchio Story,</v>

363
00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:18.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio of course,</v>

364
00:20:18.731 --> 00:20:21.160
<v Speaker 1>when he's trying to become a genuine </v>
<v Speaker 1>human being,</v>

365
00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:26.110
<v Speaker 1>instead of a marionette pulled by other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's strings or a neurotic or a,</v>

366
00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:30.130
<v Speaker 1>or a liar or a jackass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause those are his alternate destinies.</v>

367
00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:31.413
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes down to the darkest place he </v>

368
00:20:33.251 --> 00:20:36.070
<v Speaker 1>could find the bottom of the ocean and </v>
<v Speaker 1>finds the biggest monster.</v>

369
00:20:36.071 --> 00:20:36.904
<v Speaker 1>He can look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And inside he finds his father and in </v>

370
00:20:38.681 --> 00:20:40.270
<v Speaker 1>rescues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

371
00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:41.813
<v Speaker 1>and the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you find your father when you </v>

372
00:20:44.051 --> 00:20:47.020
<v Speaker 1>look into the abyss?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I really did do,</v>

373
00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:49.480
<v Speaker 1>I figured this out and it's quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>exciting to me.</v>

374
00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:51.610
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a brilliant image.</v>

375
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:56.230
<v Speaker 1>So we know as clinicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also I would say a sensible people,</v>

376
00:20:56.231 --> 00:20:59.950
<v Speaker 1>but there's good clinical documentation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this that if you find out,</v>

377
00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.193
<v Speaker 1>imagine someone's pursuing a goal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the things they have to </v>

378
00:21:04.871 --> 00:21:08.410
<v Speaker 1>accomplish or confront on the way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that goal,</v>

379
00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:12.130
<v Speaker 1>frightened them and they start to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they get more afraid.</v>

380
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:12.963
<v Speaker 1>And of course their ability to pursue </v>
<v Speaker 1>their goal or to accomplish their goal </v>

381
00:21:16.721 --> 00:21:17.554
<v Speaker 1>deteriorates because they're avoiding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a psychotherapist or even a </v>

382
00:21:20.921 --> 00:21:22.200
<v Speaker 1>friend or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

383
00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:24.160
<v Speaker 1>or a supportive loved one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

384
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:28.900
<v Speaker 1>you're going to encourage the person to </v>
<v Speaker 1>face the challenges that are making them</v>

385
00:21:28.901 --> 00:21:29.734
<v Speaker 1>afraid to face them voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happens as a consequence of </v>

386
00:21:33.851 --> 00:21:34.684
<v Speaker 1>that is that the person usually is able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to overcome those fears and develop the </v>

387
00:21:38.891 --> 00:21:42.490
<v Speaker 1>necessary skills and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to prevail.</v>

388
00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:46.570
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because not so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they get less afraid,</v>

389
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.780
<v Speaker 1>but because they get more skilled and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more courageous.</v>

390
00:21:49.781 --> 00:21:50.614
<v Speaker 1>And so imagine that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>bite off a little more than you can </v>

391
00:21:54.701 --> 00:21:57.160
<v Speaker 1>chew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get stronger as a consequence.</v>

392
00:21:57.670 --> 00:21:59.620
<v Speaker 1>And you do that in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

393
00:21:59.621 --> 00:22:00.454
<v Speaker 1>when you go lift weights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lift weights that are a little </v>

394
00:22:01.631 --> 00:22:04.000
<v Speaker 1>heavier all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a consequence,</v>

395
00:22:04.001 --> 00:22:07.540
<v Speaker 1>you develop yourself physically and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn into who you could be.</v>

396
00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:10.150
<v Speaker 1>You turned into more than you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

397
00:22:10.151 --> 00:22:13.750
<v Speaker 1>So if you face fears a little bit at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

398
00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:16.090
<v Speaker 1>fears and challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you do that voluntarily,</v>

399
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.600
<v Speaker 1>then you become more than who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

400
00:22:19.601 --> 00:22:20.434
<v Speaker 1>Now let's recast that in architectural </v>
<v Speaker 1>language and make it into a kind of </v>

401
00:22:23.501 --> 00:22:24.850
<v Speaker 1>ultimate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

402
00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:28.330
<v Speaker 1>so if you want to become everything that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be,</v>

403
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:29.463
<v Speaker 1>then you look into the abyss itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the darkest place that you can </v>

404
00:22:32.261 --> 00:22:33.094
<v Speaker 1>possibly contemplate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that would be the terror of more </v>

405
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:36.850
<v Speaker 1>mortality and insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

406
00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.940
<v Speaker 1>and if suffering and end of malevolence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those,</v>

407
00:22:39.941 --> 00:22:42.670
<v Speaker 1>it would be like looking into hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose to some degree.</v>

408
00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:48.420
<v Speaker 1>And then by voluntarily doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you call upon the strongest part of</v>

409
00:22:48.881 --> 00:22:49.714
<v Speaker 1>yourself to respond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the strongest part of yourself is </v>

410
00:22:52.531 --> 00:22:56.170
<v Speaker 1>symbolized as the sleeping farther </v>
<v Speaker 1>nested inside the beast.</v>

411
00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:01.650
<v Speaker 1>And so the fundamental truth when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>look into an abyss is that you don't see</v>

412
00:23:01.721 --> 00:23:02.230
<v Speaker 1>the abyss.</v>

413
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:03.063
<v Speaker 1>If you look long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the answer to niches </v>

414
00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:05.883
<v Speaker 1>conundrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look long enough into a bis and </v>

415
00:23:07.631 --> 00:23:09.790
<v Speaker 1>ambitious than the abyss looks into you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

416
00:23:09.791 --> 00:23:10.624
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look long enough into an abyss </v>

417
00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:17.140
<v Speaker 1>passed when the abyss looks into you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see who you could become in the form</v>

418
00:23:17.141 --> 00:23:17.974
<v Speaker 1>of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the great ancestral figures nested </v>

419
00:23:20.501 --> 00:23:25.501
<v Speaker 1>inside the catastrophe of life and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can join them so to speak.</v>

420
00:23:25.751 --> 00:23:26.584
<v Speaker 1>You can incorporate that and become </v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger and you do that partly by </v>

421
00:23:29.741 --> 00:23:30.574
<v Speaker 1>taking on the challenge voluntarily and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that informs you because you learn when </v>

422
00:23:34.421 --> 00:23:38.410
<v Speaker 1>you take on challenges voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you also do that as a consequence of</v>

423
00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.273
<v Speaker 1>psychophysiological transformation </v>
<v Speaker 1>because when you place yourself in </v>

424
00:23:42.071 --> 00:23:42.904
<v Speaker 1>challenging situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say the abyss is the archetype of </v>

425
00:23:45.591 --> 00:23:46.424
<v Speaker 1>the ultimately challenging situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you turn on new genes in your </v>

426
00:23:50.511 --> 00:23:51.344
<v Speaker 1>nervous system and in your body that </v>
<v Speaker 1>code for new proteins and you build new </v>

427
00:23:54.711 --> 00:23:55.544
<v Speaker 1>structures inside of you and none of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to happen without the </v>

428
00:23:59.031 --> 00:24:03.530
<v Speaker 1>demand that's placed on you by willing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to confront the full terror of life.</v>

429
00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:07.820
<v Speaker 1>And so then I would say the full terror </v>
<v Speaker 1>of life is something like the reality of</v>

430
00:24:07.821 --> 00:24:10.850
<v Speaker 1>suffering and death and the ever present</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

431
00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:12.013
<v Speaker 1>the ever looming presence of malevolence</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your own heart and in the heart of </v>

432
00:24:15.111 --> 00:24:15.944
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's evil and suffering and to </v>

433
00:24:17.721 --> 00:24:22.160
<v Speaker 1>confront that is really well you risk </v>
<v Speaker 1>blindness by confronting that.</v>

434
00:24:22.161 --> 00:24:25.280
<v Speaker 1>That's also a very old story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You risk damaging your vision,</v>

435
00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.473
<v Speaker 1>but if you do it forthrightly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you discover who you could be as a </v>

436
00:24:30.201 --> 00:24:35.201
<v Speaker 1>consequence and who you could be is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution to malevolence and suffering.</v>

437
00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:38.510
<v Speaker 1>And so that just blew me away when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured that out.</v>

438
00:24:38.511 --> 00:24:40.870
<v Speaker 1>It was partly a consequence of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

439
00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:42.223
<v Speaker 1>having lengthy discussions with Sam </v>
<v Speaker 1>Harris and thinking this through more </v>

440
00:24:44.781 --> 00:24:46.460
<v Speaker 1>and more been pushed to think it </v>
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

441
00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.160
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's an absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>staggering.</v>

442
00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

443
00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:57.800
<v Speaker 1>Articulating that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>articulating that image fully for me.</v>

444
00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:00.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I've articulated it </v>
<v Speaker 1>fully,</v>

445
00:25:00.111 --> 00:25:03.350
<v Speaker 1>but articulating it more fully really </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a profound effect on me.</v>

446
00:25:03.351 --> 00:25:04.184
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a brilliant conceptualization </v>

447
00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:07.693
<v Speaker 1>that inside the darkest place is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroic ancestor that whose identity you </v>

448
00:25:13.641 --> 00:25:17.030
<v Speaker 1>could incorporate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

449
00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.770
<v Speaker 1>It's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I really believe it's true.</v>

450
00:25:18.771 --> 00:25:19.604
<v Speaker 1>And what it does is it says that human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being is actually stronger than the </v>

451
00:25:23.541 --> 00:25:26.600
<v Speaker 1>greatest challenge that can be set </v>
<v Speaker 1>before him or her.</v>

452
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.300
<v Speaker 1>And that's really something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also believe it's true.</v>

453
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:30.463
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that's so interesting </v>

454
00:25:32.871 --> 00:25:36.470
<v Speaker 1>about that is that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it transforms pessimism into optimism.</v>

455
00:25:36.471 --> 00:25:36.891
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

456
00:25:36.891 --> 00:25:37.724
<v Speaker 1>the world is a very dark place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's full of suffering and it's full of </v>

457
00:25:39.651 --> 00:25:40.484
<v Speaker 1>malevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it might even be so full of </v>

458
00:25:42.111 --> 00:25:42.944
<v Speaker 1>suffering and malevolence that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable person could question the </v>

459
00:25:46.431 --> 00:25:50.830
<v Speaker 1>justification of its being a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a Ivan Karamozov does in,</v>

460
00:25:50.831 --> 00:25:53.240
<v Speaker 1>in the brothers Karamazov which I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>highly recommend.</v>

461
00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.070
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an absolutely great book,</v>

462
00:25:55.071 --> 00:25:56.780
<v Speaker 1>dusty fce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

463
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:59.900
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth of the matter seems to be that</v>

464
00:25:59.901 --> 00:26:03.410
<v Speaker 1>if you face the pessimism full frontal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

465
00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:07.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you find something in you that can,</v>

466
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.560
<v Speaker 1>that's strong enough to take it on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really says something about,</v>

467
00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:16.100
<v Speaker 1>what would you say the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>between human beings in divinity,</v>

468
00:26:16.101 --> 00:26:16.934
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it takes something transcendent </v>

469
00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:21.893
<v Speaker 1>of transcendent power to be able to rise</v>
<v Speaker 1>above the genuine suffering and </v>

470
00:26:26.571 --> 00:26:27.404
<v Speaker 1>malevolence of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I do think that we have that within </v>

471
00:26:29.151 --> 00:26:31.670
<v Speaker 1>us if we don't shy away from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge.</v>

472
00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:34.710
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's in,</v>

473
00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:37.910
<v Speaker 1>in the story of King Arthur and the holy</v>
<v Speaker 1>grail,</v>

474
00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:43.040
<v Speaker 1>so the holy grail is one of two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a cup that either held the,</v>

475
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:48.240
<v Speaker 1>that Christ drank at the last supper or </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was used to catch his blood when he</v>

476
00:26:48.241 --> 00:26:50.220
<v Speaker 1>was speared on the cross.</v>

477
00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Either one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's the,</v>

478
00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.450
<v Speaker 1>it's the reservoir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

479
00:26:54.451 --> 00:26:58.320
<v Speaker 1>of the fluid that eternally nourishes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

480
00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.770
<v Speaker 1>And when you go to look for the holy </v>
<v Speaker 1>Grail,</v>

481
00:27:01.771 --> 00:27:04.650
<v Speaker 1>you don't know where to look because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know where the holy grail is.</v>

482
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:08.680
<v Speaker 1>And so King Arthur and his knights who </v>
<v Speaker 1>all sit at a round table because they're</v>

483
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:11.970
<v Speaker 1>essentially equals each go off to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>the holy grail.</v>

484
00:27:11.971 --> 00:27:12.804
<v Speaker 1>And each of them enters the forest to </v>
<v Speaker 1>begin the quest at the place that looks </v>

485
00:27:17.101 --> 00:27:17.934
<v Speaker 1>darkest to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's another example of the same </v>

486
00:27:21.391 --> 00:27:23.880
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what you and another,</v>

487
00:27:23.881 --> 00:27:26.730
<v Speaker 1>it's another example of a dictum from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl Young,</v>

488
00:27:26.731 --> 00:27:28.860
<v Speaker 1>which he extracted from the all chemical</v>
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>

489
00:27:28.861 --> 00:27:32.070
<v Speaker 1>which was in stir curliness invented </v>
<v Speaker 1>tour,</v>

490
00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.113
<v Speaker 1>which means roughly speaking in filth </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will be found or more to the point </v>

491
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.070
<v Speaker 1>what you most need will be found where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you least want to look,</v>

492
00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:42.930
<v Speaker 1>but you have to look purposefully.</v>

493
00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:45.540
<v Speaker 1>If it chases you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your prey,</v>

494
00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.080
<v Speaker 1>if you confront it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're the thing that can transcend</v>

495
00:27:49.081 --> 00:27:49.914
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a unbelievably optimistic </v>

496
00:27:52.321 --> 00:27:53.154
<v Speaker 1>message because it suggests that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're willing to take on the burden of </v>

497
00:27:56.221 --> 00:27:58.290
<v Speaker 1>being with it's suffering and </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence,</v>

498
00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:02.910
<v Speaker 1>that you can awaken that with that which</v>
<v Speaker 1>is within you,</v>

499
00:28:02.911 --> 00:28:07.911
<v Speaker 1>that will allow you to prevail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And God only knows how deep an idea that</v>

500
00:28:08.461 --> 00:28:11.040
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be the deepest of ideas because</v>

501
00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:16.340
<v Speaker 1>who knows what the limit of a human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being is so well,</v>

502
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:18.570
<v Speaker 1>that's some of the wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

503
00:28:18.571 --> 00:28:20.160
<v Speaker 1>that have acquired in the last few </v>
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

504
00:28:20.161 --> 00:28:22.070
<v Speaker 1>And there's quite a bit more too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

505
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to write all this down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully publish a bunch of it.</v>

506
00:28:25.441 --> 00:28:26.274
<v Speaker 1>And my next book I figured out a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>about hierarchies to and how they </v>

507
00:28:29.041 --> 00:28:30.630
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a whole,</v>

508
00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:34.620
<v Speaker 1>I've developed a whole new way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizing.</v>

509
00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:35.843
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I was arguing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Sam arguing with about with Sam </v>

510
00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:41.363
<v Speaker 1>Harris was the relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts and values because Sam and he has </v>

511
00:28:45.331 --> 00:28:46.164
<v Speaker 1>his reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd like to propose that we can derive </v>

512
00:28:48.241 --> 00:28:51.240
<v Speaker 1>values directly from facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he wants to do that because he wants</v>

513
00:28:51.241 --> 00:28:55.980
<v Speaker 1>to nail the world of values to something</v>
<v Speaker 1>solid so it doesn't float in air and,</v>

514
00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:56.953
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

515
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.380
<v Speaker 1>and get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

516
00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:01.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

517
00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Hijacked by the fundamentalists or </v>
<v Speaker 1>dissolve into nihilism.</v>

518
00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:09.150
<v Speaker 1>And both of those are terrible ends for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a hierarchy of value.</v>

519
00:29:09.151 --> 00:29:14.151
<v Speaker 1>So he wants to nail it to something more</v>
<v Speaker 1>objective and,</v>

520
00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:15.923
<v Speaker 1>and less relativistic and less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less grounded in revealed truth that </v>

521
00:29:22.921 --> 00:29:24.630
<v Speaker 1>removes it from the domain of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalism.</v>

522
00:29:24.631 --> 00:29:27.960
<v Speaker 1>And so I can understand his point and </v>
<v Speaker 1>why he wants to do that.</v>

523
00:29:27.961 --> 00:29:28.794
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is is that it isn't easy</v>
<v Speaker 1>to drive values from facts because </v>

524
00:29:31.831 --> 00:29:32.664
<v Speaker 1>there's an infinite number of facts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>by necessity a very finite number of </v>

525
00:29:36.841 --> 00:29:37.440
<v Speaker 1>values.</v>

526
00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.273
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time when you're doing </v>

527
00:29:39.361 --> 00:29:41.860
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're reducing the whole world to value</v>

528
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:42.963
<v Speaker 1>and that value is encapsulated in </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever goal you happened to be </v>

529
00:29:45.851 --> 00:29:48.400
<v Speaker 1>pursuing at the moment or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're paying attention to,</v>

530
00:29:48.401 --> 00:29:50.560
<v Speaker 1>which is also a form of goal directed </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuit.</v>

531
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:54.160
<v Speaker 1>And so I've also figured out that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I kind of knew this,</v>

532
00:29:54.161 --> 00:29:54.994
<v Speaker 1>but I could articulate it better now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you look at the world of facts </v>

533
00:29:58.151 --> 00:29:58.984
<v Speaker 1>through a hierarchy of values and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy of values is instantiated in </v>

534
00:30:01.901 --> 00:30:02.734
<v Speaker 1>your nervous system and simultaneously a</v>
<v Speaker 1>social construct because you pay </v>

535
00:30:07.391 --> 00:30:08.224
<v Speaker 1>attention to things of value that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everyone else have established as </v>

536
00:30:12.581 --> 00:30:15.160
<v Speaker 1>valuable through a process of social </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiation.</v>

537
00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.370
<v Speaker 1>And you need to pay attention to what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think that's valuable,</v>

538
00:30:18.371 --> 00:30:19.204
<v Speaker 1>that everyone else thinks is valuable </v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise you wouldn't have any </v>

539
00:30:22.151 --> 00:30:22.984
<v Speaker 1>basis for shared attention and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have any basis for trade with </v>

540
00:30:25.811 --> 00:30:26.644
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

541
00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:29.920
<v Speaker 1>So that's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's really been helpful because,</v>

542
00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:31.023
<v Speaker 1>so now I figured out that you reduce the</v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite world of facts to the finite </v>

543
00:30:35.591 --> 00:30:36.424
<v Speaker 1>world of values by viewing the world of </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts through what's essentially a </v>

544
00:30:40.481 --> 00:30:43.870
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy of value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

545
00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:45.093
<v Speaker 1>and that that exists both out in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>social world and neurologically at the </v>

546
00:30:48.281 --> 00:30:49.114
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's been unbelievably useful </v>

547
00:30:51.311 --> 00:30:52.144
<v Speaker 1>to figure out too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a part of a mystery that I'd been </v>

548
00:30:54.971 --> 00:30:56.860
<v Speaker 1>trying to untangle for about three </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades.</v>

549
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:58.023
<v Speaker 1>So that's extremely helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've also spent some more time </v>

550
00:31:04.001 --> 00:31:07.990
<v Speaker 1>thinking about the proper place of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right and the left wing.</v>

551
00:31:07.991 --> 00:31:10.390
<v Speaker 1>So the right wing basically stands for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

552
00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:12.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call the,</v>

553
00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:19.570
<v Speaker 1>the right wing serves as an advocate for</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

554
00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:25.300
<v Speaker 1>And the left wing serves as a critic of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and the rights says,</v>

555
00:31:25.301 --> 00:31:26.134
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need hierarchies there often </v>

556
00:31:27.161 --> 00:31:30.160
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies of competence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're necessary to organize people and</v>

557
00:31:30.161 --> 00:31:32.290
<v Speaker 1>society and they're necessary to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>things done,</v>

558
00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.870
<v Speaker 1>all of which is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the left says yes,</v>

559
00:31:34.871 --> 00:31:35.704
<v Speaker 1>but hierarchies dispossessed and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to pay attention to the widows and </v>

560
00:31:39.191 --> 00:31:41.140
<v Speaker 1>the orphans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also true.</v>

561
00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:46.620
<v Speaker 1>And so then the political discussion is </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how to ensure that hierarchies are</v>

562
00:31:46.661 --> 00:31:47.494
<v Speaker 1>maintained and are functional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also have sufficient mercy within </v>

563
00:31:51.671 --> 00:31:52.504
<v Speaker 1>them to take care of the people who for </v>
<v Speaker 1>one reason or another are struggling to </v>

564
00:31:56.711 --> 00:31:59.350
<v Speaker 1>find their place even in a hierarchy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>competence.</v>

565
00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:04.740
<v Speaker 1>And then the necessity for free speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerges out of that because the left and</v>

566
00:32:05.381 --> 00:32:07.030
<v Speaker 1>the right have to communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

567
00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:08.490
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

568
00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:11.550
<v Speaker 1>the proper balance between the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

569
00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:16.910
<v Speaker 1>the current structure of the hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's transformation and mercy can be</v>

570
00:32:17.731 --> 00:32:20.280
<v Speaker 1>established on an ongoing basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

571
00:32:20.281 --> 00:32:22.830
<v Speaker 1>there are three things that I've really </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned over the last few months.</v>

572
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:24.750
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those will do for now.</v>

573
00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:26.243
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

574
00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:49.150
<v Speaker 1>if too much masculine masculinity is </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyranny,</v>

575
00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:52.690
<v Speaker 1>but the right amount is order and too </v>
<v Speaker 1>much feminine is chaos,</v>

576
00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:56.620
<v Speaker 1>what's the word for the right amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>femininity?</v>

577
00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:00.010
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read that a bit earlier and I couldn't</v>

578
00:33:00.011 --> 00:33:00.844
<v Speaker 1>come up with something immediate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the only thing I can think of is </v>

579
00:33:04.811 --> 00:33:09.811
<v Speaker 1>that often femininity has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized as wisdom.</v>

580
00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:15.690
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

581
00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:20.700
<v Speaker 1>the wisdom that God in the Judeo </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian tradition that God consults is</v>

582
00:33:21.551 --> 00:33:23.650
<v Speaker 1>feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an old tradition.</v>

583
00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:25.173
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's because order needs to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be leaving with the right amount of </v>

584
00:33:30.041 --> 00:33:33.850
<v Speaker 1>chaos in order for wisdom to emerge the </v>
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>

585
00:33:33.851 --> 00:33:36.520
<v Speaker 1>it can be blinded and tyrannical and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dead.</v>

586
00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:38.103
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the mixture of the right amount of </v>

587
00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:41.853
<v Speaker 1>chaos that turns that order into wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that wisdom is often persona </v>

588
00:33:45.821 --> 00:33:46.600
<v Speaker 1>fired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his feminine.</v>

589
00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:47.433
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't exactly answer your </v>
<v Speaker 1>question because it doesn't make the </v>

590
00:33:50.411 --> 00:33:53.320
<v Speaker 1>right balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You still don't have tyranny order.</v>

591
00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.270
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

592
00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:59.040
<v Speaker 1>You still don't have order tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

593
00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:01.560
<v Speaker 1>You're still missing the proper word </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

594
00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

595
00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.580
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good question.</v>

596
00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:07.230
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the wisdom ideas,</v>

597
00:34:07.231 --> 00:34:08.064
<v Speaker 1>the best I can make of it for now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it better to marry someone with your </v>

598
00:34:11.971 --> 00:34:16.080
<v Speaker 1>temperament or a contracting </v>
<v Speaker 1>complimentary temperament?</v>

599
00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:17.633
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is evidence on this and basically </v>

600
00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:23.070
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to marry someone with </v>
<v Speaker 1>whom you're two mismatched.</v>

601
00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:24.353
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only possible exception to that is </v>

602
00:34:26.131 --> 00:34:26.964
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neuroticism is a good predictor of </v>

603
00:34:30.691 --> 00:34:33.030
<v Speaker 1>marital trouble and it's a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>predictor of trouble,</v>

604
00:34:33.031 --> 00:34:35.370
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or perhaps sensitivity to trouble,</v>

605
00:34:35.371 --> 00:34:39.270
<v Speaker 1>which is in some sense the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

606
00:34:39.450 --> 00:34:43.740
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know of any research </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically pertaining to this.</v>

607
00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:45.241
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

608
00:34:45.241 --> 00:34:48.540
<v Speaker 1>I know that people who are high in </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism are more likely to miss work</v>

609
00:34:48.541 --> 00:34:52.640
<v Speaker 1>and to visit the doctor and to um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

610
00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:54.930
<v Speaker 1>and to be unhappy in their marriages and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so forth.</v>

611
00:34:55.230 --> 00:35:00.230
<v Speaker 1>And that may also account for why 75% of</v>
<v Speaker 1>divorces are initiated by women.</v>

612
00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:01.643
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think women are more sensitive to </v>

613
00:35:03.151 --> 00:35:05.400
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because they have to take care of</v>

614
00:35:05.401 --> 00:35:07.590
<v Speaker 1>infants and need to be more sensitive to</v>
<v Speaker 1>threat.</v>

615
00:35:07.591 --> 00:35:08.424
<v Speaker 1>And perhaps because sexuality is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous to women and perhaps because </v>

616
00:35:13.501 --> 00:35:14.334
<v Speaker 1>women are physically smaller and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this seems to kick in at puberty </v>

617
00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:18.893
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't obvious to me that you want to </v>

618
00:35:20.851 --> 00:35:23.190
<v Speaker 1>match someone with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism.</v>

619
00:35:23.191 --> 00:35:26.220
<v Speaker 1>If you're high in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're high in neuroticism,</v>

620
00:35:26.221 --> 00:35:28.530
<v Speaker 1>you need to find someone who's low in </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism,</v>

621
00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:29.953
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because then you have someone around to </v>

622
00:35:31.501 --> 00:35:34.170
<v Speaker 1>calm you down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now apart from that,</v>

623
00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:39.980
<v Speaker 1>the research literature does indicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>match is better and you can see why it's</v>

624
00:35:40.861 --> 00:35:43.860
<v Speaker 1>hard for extroverts and introverts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get along if they're,</v>

625
00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:44.843
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're extreme extroverts</v>
<v Speaker 1>and extreme introverts because an </v>

626
00:35:46.951 --> 00:35:47.784
<v Speaker 1>extreme extrovert always wants to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>with other people and in groups and an </v>

627
00:35:51.901 --> 00:35:55.650
<v Speaker 1>extreme introvert hardly ever wants that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a very,</v>

628
00:35:55.651 --> 00:35:57.480
<v Speaker 1>very difficult thing to negotiate.</v>

629
00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:00.900
<v Speaker 1>And then with conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

630
00:36:00.901 --> 00:36:01.734
<v Speaker 1>If you're really high in orderliness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to be married to someone </v>

631
00:36:04.171 --> 00:36:05.004
<v Speaker 1>who very low and ordered in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to end up doing all the </v>

632
00:36:06.841 --> 00:36:07.674
<v Speaker 1>cleaning for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will drive you crazy and if you're </v>

633
00:36:09.241 --> 00:36:11.220
<v Speaker 1>high and industriousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing,</v>

634
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:15.060
<v Speaker 1>healthy are super high and </v>
<v Speaker 1>industriousness and orderliness.</v>

635
00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:19.080
<v Speaker 1>You might want someone who's maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>moderate in both to kind of temper you a</v>

636
00:36:19.081 --> 00:36:19.914
<v Speaker 1>bit because one of the problems with </v>
<v Speaker 1>being too high in conscientiousness is </v>

637
00:36:22.351 --> 00:36:23.184
<v Speaker 1>that you can't stop working and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should probably stop working from time </v>

638
00:36:25.921 --> 00:36:27.810
<v Speaker 1>to time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Agreeableness,</v>

639
00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:28.853
<v Speaker 1>same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard for an agreeable and disagreeable </v>

640
00:36:30.661 --> 00:36:32.310
<v Speaker 1>person to get along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

641
00:36:32.311 --> 00:36:37.311
<v Speaker 1>the agreeable person will always be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the disagreeable person</v>

642
00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:40.293
<v Speaker 1>who won't shy away from conflict is </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to dominate the agreeable person </v>

643
00:36:43.691 --> 00:36:47.720
<v Speaker 1>quite badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a tough bridge to two.</v>

644
00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:48.873
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough chasm to bridge as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you look for temperamental </v>

645
00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:57.960
<v Speaker 1>similarity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm at now it's complicated because like</v>

646
00:36:58.061 --> 00:36:58.894
<v Speaker 1>if you're really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really low and industriousness and you </v>

647
00:37:00.101 --> 00:37:02.320
<v Speaker 1>marry someone else who's really low and </v>
<v Speaker 1>industriousness,</v>

648
00:37:02.321 --> 00:37:03.154
<v Speaker 1>well that's going to be trouble for both</v>
<v Speaker 1>of you because there isn't going to be </v>

649
00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:07.210
<v Speaker 1>anyone around who's going to do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

650
00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:08.940
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

651
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:10.023
<v Speaker 1>you might understand each other better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as a longterm strategy it's not a </v>

652
00:37:12.851 --> 00:37:14.350
<v Speaker 1>very good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

653
00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.300
<v Speaker 1>it seems like your message is primarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive masculine,</v>

654
00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:20.913
<v Speaker 1>whereas the positive feminine is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>elaborated with near the same </v>

655
00:37:23.981 --> 00:37:25.900
<v Speaker 1>resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

656
00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really think that's true.</v>

657
00:37:29.261 --> 00:37:30.094
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that might be somewhat true of </v>

658
00:37:31.541 --> 00:37:33.970
<v Speaker 1>12 rules for life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I'm not convinced of that.</v>

659
00:37:33.971 --> 00:37:38.200
<v Speaker 1>That message and 12 rules for life is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>find a balance between order and chaos.</v>

660
00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:39.633
<v Speaker 1>And there's plenty of discussion in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there about the danger of an excess of </v>

661
00:37:43.541 --> 00:37:46.180
<v Speaker 1>both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly maps of meaning is,</v>

662
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:47.463
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elaborated out more with regards to the </v>

663
00:37:51.401 --> 00:37:52.234
<v Speaker 1>positive masculine or with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 1>maps of meaning is elaborated out more </v>

664
00:37:57.821 --> 00:37:58.654
<v Speaker 1>completely than 12 rules with regards to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the positive role of the masculine and </v>

665
00:38:02.291 --> 00:38:03.670
<v Speaker 1>the feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

666
00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.033
<v Speaker 1>I think it's complicated in part because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feminine classically speaking is </v>

667
00:38:10.991 --> 00:38:15.991
<v Speaker 1>associated with smaller scale intimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>familial groupings.</v>

668
00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:18.783
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

669
00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:26.733
<v Speaker 1>in a world that's obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptation to large scale social </v>

670
00:38:29.351 --> 00:38:30.184
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's harder to make a case for the role </v>

671
00:38:34.001 --> 00:38:34.834
<v Speaker 1>of the feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't understand the role of the </v>

672
00:38:36.311 --> 00:38:38.470
<v Speaker 1>feminine in large scale social </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures.</v>

673
00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:40.540
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

674
00:38:40.541 --> 00:38:45.460
<v Speaker 1>we don't have a cultural myth apart from</v>
<v Speaker 1>beauty and the beast,</v>

675
00:38:45.461 --> 00:38:46.294
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that describes the role of an </v>

676
00:38:48.671 --> 00:38:53.671
<v Speaker 1>independent female operating in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally masculine social world.</v>

677
00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.020
<v Speaker 1>And we don't even know what something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that would look like.</v>

678
00:38:59.021 --> 00:38:59.854
<v Speaker 1>And there aren't guiding stories to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree because women haven't been able </v>

679
00:39:05.021 --> 00:39:08.110
<v Speaker 1>to do that except in the last hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

680
00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:10.053
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the positive feminine on a large </v>

681
00:39:14.231 --> 00:39:15.064
<v Speaker 1>scale would look like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we don't have guiding stories for </v>

682
00:39:18.521 --> 00:39:19.354
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is partly to underlined the </v>

683
00:39:22.991 --> 00:39:26.440
<v Speaker 1>absolutely radical nature of the birth </v>
<v Speaker 1>control pill.</v>

684
00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:29.170
<v Speaker 1>And and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the provision of,</v>

685
00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:30.153
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of technological devices that aid women </v>

686
00:39:33.251 --> 00:39:38.251
<v Speaker 1>in dealing practically with their weekly</v>
<v Speaker 1>or their monthly menstrual cycle,</v>

687
00:39:38.861 --> 00:39:43.861
<v Speaker 1>which was also a huge impediment to </v>
<v Speaker 1>women in terms of interacting in the,</v>

688
00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.120
<v Speaker 1>let's say the patriarchal world.</v>

689
00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:50.920
<v Speaker 1>So now women can take their place in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>broader cultural world and we don't know</v>

690
00:39:50.921 --> 00:39:54.160
<v Speaker 1>what the model for that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

691
00:39:54.161 --> 00:39:54.994
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they should adopt the heroin </v>

692
00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:00.100
<v Speaker 1>masculine perspective and certainly to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree that's true,</v>

693
00:40:00.101 --> 00:40:00.934
<v Speaker 1>but that's not a particularly fruitful </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetype when it comes to having a </v>

694
00:40:09.341 --> 00:40:10.174
<v Speaker 1>family and having a family is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily important and it's </v>

695
00:40:13.601 --> 00:40:14.434
<v Speaker 1>certainly the thing that dominates the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts of the majority of women as </v>

696
00:40:17.861 --> 00:40:22.330
<v Speaker 1>they approached their thirties all </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural noise to the contrary.</v>

697
00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:23.883
<v Speaker 1>So it's something we're still puzzling </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and I suppose I'm still puzzling it </v>

698
00:40:27.281 --> 00:40:29.140
<v Speaker 1>out too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean with my daughter,</v>

699
00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:34.800
<v Speaker 1>I tried to encourage her to be as sharp </v>
<v Speaker 1>and is intelligent and critically minded</v>

700
00:40:36.071 --> 00:40:36.904
<v Speaker 1>and ambitious as she could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also let her to let her know that </v>

701
00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:42.790
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she,</v>

702
00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:43.653
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was always interested in having </v>

703
00:40:44.891 --> 00:40:45.724
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

704
00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:46.683
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to also let her know that having a </v>

705
00:40:48.311 --> 00:40:51.260
<v Speaker 1>family as an extremely important thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

706
00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:52.533
<v Speaker 1>how to balance that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that is the modern conundrum isn't </v>

707
00:40:54.551 --> 00:40:55.384
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to figure out how to maximize </v>

708
00:40:57.761 --> 00:40:58.594
<v Speaker 1>our access to the talents of women but </v>
<v Speaker 1>also to set up a situation where it's </v>

709
00:41:02.951 --> 00:41:07.951
<v Speaker 1>possible for talented women and women of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all talents let's say as well,</v>

710
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:09.063
<v Speaker 1>but talented women who have options in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the workplace to also have a family and </v>

711
00:41:12.671 --> 00:41:13.504
<v Speaker 1>this is a tremendously complex problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it isn't clear how it's going to be </v>

712
00:41:17.951 --> 00:41:19.480
<v Speaker 1>solved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

713
00:41:19.481 --> 00:41:20.950
<v Speaker 1>there is data showing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

714
00:41:20.951 --> 00:41:21.784
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well men should pick up more of the </v>

715
00:41:22.601 --> 00:41:25.270
<v Speaker 1>feminine role and I suppose that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

716
00:41:25.271 --> 00:41:27.970
<v Speaker 1>But there is good data showing for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

717
00:41:27.971 --> 00:41:32.971
<v Speaker 1>that if you show women pictures of men </v>
<v Speaker 1>engaged in classically masculine,</v>

718
00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:35.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fixing a roof for fixing the plumbing or</v>

719
00:41:35.901 --> 00:41:37.360
<v Speaker 1>so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

720
00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:40.310
<v Speaker 1>or in feminine endeavors doing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dishes and,</v>

721
00:41:40.311 --> 00:41:41.091
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

722
00:41:41.091 --> 00:41:41.924
<v Speaker 1>and vacuuming that the women raped the </v>
<v Speaker 1>man who are doing the female tasks as </v>

723
00:41:45.261 --> 00:41:46.094
<v Speaker 1>well as less sexually attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not all on the men with </v>

724
00:41:49.881 --> 00:41:53.900
<v Speaker 1>regards to the utility of them picking </v>
<v Speaker 1>up a more feminine role,</v>

725
00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:55.153
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it isn't necessarily the case that </v>

726
00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:01.280
<v Speaker 1>women will find men who are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>domestic,</v>

727
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:02.203
<v Speaker 1>also maximumly sexually attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things don't necessarily go </v>

728
00:42:05.061 --> 00:42:06.260
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is very,</v>

729
00:42:06.261 --> 00:42:08.630
<v Speaker 1>very complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

730
00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:17.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm quite shy and when asked questions </v>
<v Speaker 1>in public,</v>

731
00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.490
<v Speaker 1>I find it hard to articulate a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer,</v>

732
00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:23.120
<v Speaker 1>but we'll come up with a strong response</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours or days later.</v>

733
00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.440
<v Speaker 1>Any advice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

734
00:42:24.441 --> 00:42:26.900
<v Speaker 1>I have some advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is that,</v>

735
00:42:26.901 --> 00:42:27.734
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you're probably introverted a so </v>

736
00:42:29.151 --> 00:42:29.984
<v Speaker 1>you're not as verbally fluent as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>extrovert would be a not quite as fast </v>

737
00:42:32.751 --> 00:42:34.580
<v Speaker 1>on the draw verbally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

738
00:42:34.581 --> 00:42:35.414
<v Speaker 1>that means you need some more time to </v>
<v Speaker 1>contemplate and maybe you're high in </v>

739
00:42:38.091 --> 00:42:40.100
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

740
00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:43.760
<v Speaker 1>because shyness can be a combination of </v>
<v Speaker 1>introversion and high negative emotion.</v>

741
00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:45.950
<v Speaker 1>It can be one or the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

742
00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:49.790
<v Speaker 1>but technically shy is introverted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

743
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:53.390
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I would certainly recommend for you</v>

744
00:42:53.391 --> 00:42:57.380
<v Speaker 1>is that if you're faced with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated question,</v>

745
00:42:57.650 --> 00:43:00.830
<v Speaker 1>especially one that has to do with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>important decision in your life,</v>

746
00:43:00.831 --> 00:43:05.720
<v Speaker 1>that you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to sleep on it or I need a couple</v>

747
00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:08.740
<v Speaker 1>of days and not to answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

748
00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:10.603
<v Speaker 1>on the draw.</v>

749
00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:13.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's true even for extroverts.</v>

750
00:43:13.431 --> 00:43:14.264
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're at called upon to </v>
<v Speaker 1>offer your opinion about something </v>

751
00:43:17.841 --> 00:43:20.270
<v Speaker 1>complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's perfectly reasonable to say,</v>

752
00:43:20.271 --> 00:43:22.310
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really hard question.</v>

753
00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:24.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to give you a casual </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>

754
00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:26.270
<v Speaker 1>I need to think about it for a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

755
00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:30.890
<v Speaker 1>So the advice would be because you find </v>
<v Speaker 1>it hard to articulate a good answer,</v>

756
00:43:30.891 --> 00:43:31.724
<v Speaker 1>don't allow yourself to be rushed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the second is to understand that </v>

757
00:43:34.791 --> 00:43:37.550
<v Speaker 1>this is part of your temperament there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There isn't anything wrong with it.</v>

758
00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:39.320
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

759
00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:41.000
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's how you're wired.</v>

760
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:42.223
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

761
00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:47.320
<v Speaker 1>what causes a person to hoard?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it due to low conscientiousness?</v>

762
00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:49.780
<v Speaker 1>What is generally the best course of </v>
<v Speaker 1>treatment?</v>

763
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:54.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's usually a consequence of relatively</v>

764
00:43:54.641 --> 00:43:56.590
<v Speaker 1>high in neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

765
00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:01.060
<v Speaker 1>and it's tangled in with disgust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity as well.</v>

766
00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:03.003
<v Speaker 1>People who hoard have a hard time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel guilty if they throw things </v>

767
00:44:07.751 --> 00:44:11.350
<v Speaker 1>away because the thing's still have some</v>
<v Speaker 1>residual utility.</v>

768
00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:12.843
<v Speaker 1>The best course of treatment is well </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral therapies probably the best </v>

769
00:44:16.601 --> 00:44:18.170
<v Speaker 1>course of treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

770
00:44:23.810 --> 00:44:24.643
<v Speaker 1>and to plan what needs to be thrown away</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to work with a person that can help </v>

771
00:44:28.951 --> 00:44:33.390
<v Speaker 1>you make the hard decisions that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that need to be made.</v>

772
00:44:33.391 --> 00:44:38.391
<v Speaker 1>If you're hoarding</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that,</v>

773
00:44:39.091 --> 00:44:39.924
<v Speaker 1>all that hoarded material is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's decisions that have been put </v>

774
00:44:44.431 --> 00:44:48.600
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of that is high neuroticism.</v>

775
00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:50.700
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of that can be a consequence of low</v>

776
00:44:50.701 --> 00:44:51.534
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the best course of treatment is to </v>

777
00:44:55.201 --> 00:44:59.130
<v Speaker 1>find someone to help you plan how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach the,</v>

778
00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:01.380
<v Speaker 1>the horde.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very complicated.</v>

779
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:06.950
<v Speaker 1>So all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which hogwarts house would you be in?</v>

780
00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:25.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'd have the same issue as Harry</v>

781
00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:26.013
<v Speaker 1>Potter when the hat was first put on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would think that I might make a </v>

782
00:45:28.361 --> 00:45:31.810
<v Speaker 1>perfectly good dennis in of slitherin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

783
00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:34.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although that probably wouldn't be where</v>

784
00:45:34.211 --> 00:45:36.150
<v Speaker 1>I would end up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

785
00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:48.900
<v Speaker 1>what is your take on an astrological </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis for significant dates in religious</v>

786
00:45:48.901 --> 00:45:50.310
<v Speaker 1>stories?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Example,</v>

787
00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.220
<v Speaker 1>Christian religion is a parody on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worship of the sun.</v>

788
00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly not a parody.</v>

789
00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:57.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>

790
00:45:57.870 --> 00:45:58.703
<v Speaker 1>religious systems as they expand tend to</v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporate everything that's quasi </v>

791
00:46:03.481 --> 00:46:04.314
<v Speaker 1>religious in the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's certainly no shortage of </v>

792
00:46:06.721 --> 00:46:09.780
<v Speaker 1>solar symbolism in Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

793
00:46:09.781 --> 00:46:14.781
<v Speaker 1>it's not fluke that that Christ is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>son and there are 12 disciples just like</v>

794
00:46:15.751 --> 00:46:18.900
<v Speaker 1>there are 12 astrological houses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not fluke that,</v>

795
00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.193
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the birth of Christ takes place </v>

796
00:46:22.381 --> 00:46:24.780
<v Speaker 1>essentially at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time as,</v>

797
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:25.703
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the shortest day of the year and the </v>

798
00:46:27.481 --> 00:46:30.750
<v Speaker 1>rebirth of the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these things line up.</v>

799
00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:31.613
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether that synchronicity or whether </v>

800
00:46:33.211 --> 00:46:34.044
<v Speaker 1>it's the attempt by the collective </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination of human beings to align </v>

801
00:46:39.811 --> 00:46:43.740
<v Speaker 1>everything under a single truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very difficult thing to say.</v>

802
00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:44.723
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe there's a single truth at work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that Christian religion is </v>

803
00:46:48.421 --> 00:46:50.580
<v Speaker 1>a parody on the worship of the sun is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

804
00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:51.473
<v Speaker 1>is definitely not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more like it's incorporated </v>

805
00:46:53.551 --> 00:46:58.050
<v Speaker 1>elements of the worship of the sun over </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands of years.</v>

806
00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:01.950
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very complicated issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're interested in that,</v>

807
00:47:01.951 --> 00:47:05.910
<v Speaker 1>you could read I on Ai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>o n it's booked by Carl Young,</v>

808
00:47:05.911 --> 00:47:08.190
<v Speaker 1>which is like the most terrifying book </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever read.</v>

809
00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:09.353
<v Speaker 1>And so you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a deeper analysis of the </v>

810
00:47:12.031 --> 00:47:14.400
<v Speaker 1>relationship between astrological </v>
<v Speaker 1>speculation,</v>

811
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:15.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

812
00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:18.900
<v Speaker 1>and the emergence of complex religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

813
00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:20.213
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

814
00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:33.360
<v Speaker 1>my brother 29 to sick at home with </v>
<v Speaker 1>burnout.</v>

815
00:47:33.361 --> 00:47:35.100
<v Speaker 1>He's a perfectionist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has anxiety,</v>

816
00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:38.400
<v Speaker 1>has trouble dealing with stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can I help them become stronger?</v>

817
00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:39.413
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could encourage him to go talk to a </v>

818
00:47:40.321 --> 00:47:42.620
<v Speaker 1>therapist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could tell him to go find broadly,</v>

819
00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:43.583
<v Speaker 1>make an appointment with three of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go talk to each one for an hour and if </v>

820
00:47:47.221 --> 00:47:49.440
<v Speaker 1>he likes one of them and he finds one </v>
<v Speaker 1>who listens,</v>

821
00:47:49.441 --> 00:47:50.274
<v Speaker 1>then he can go back a couple more times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it isn't going to hurt him to go </v>

822
00:47:52.231 --> 00:47:54.930
<v Speaker 1>once at least to go talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

823
00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:58.830
<v Speaker 1>it's also possible that he needs someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk to them about medication.</v>

824
00:47:59.190 --> 00:48:00.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants,</v>

825
00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:01.613
<v Speaker 1>if he's written real trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Antidepressants are often very helpful </v>

826
00:48:03.991 --> 00:48:04.890
<v Speaker 1>to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not always,</v>

827
00:48:04.891 --> 00:48:07.410
<v Speaker 1>but often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that is a lot better.</v>

828
00:48:07.411 --> 00:48:08.244
<v Speaker 1>Taking an antidepressant beats the hell </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of being sick at home with burnout </v>

829
00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:15.810
<v Speaker 1>and it's attended dangers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive dangers,</v>

830
00:48:15.811 --> 00:48:19.530
<v Speaker 1>dangers of stress induced illness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangers of suicidal ideation,</v>

831
00:48:19.531 --> 00:48:20.490
<v Speaker 1>all that sort of thing.</v>

832
00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would also recommend that he tried the</v>

833
00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:27.450
<v Speaker 1>self authoring program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he's at home,</v>

834
00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:30.540
<v Speaker 1>he could write about his past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could write about his presence,</v>

835
00:48:30.541 --> 00:48:32.700
<v Speaker 1>he could write about his future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can do a bad job,</v>

836
00:48:32.701 --> 00:48:34.740
<v Speaker 1>he can do it over days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

837
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:35.783
<v Speaker 1>I mean we have evidence that the program</v>
<v Speaker 1>is extremely helpful to people and </v>

838
00:48:38.191 --> 00:48:41.520
<v Speaker 1>there's evidence from other researchers </v>
<v Speaker 1>that such programs really help.</v>

839
00:48:41.521 --> 00:48:42.354
<v Speaker 1>So that would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be something that he could </v>

840
00:48:44.671 --> 00:48:45.001
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

841
00:48:45.001 --> 00:48:47.490
<v Speaker 1>he's sitting at home and it's not going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to hurt him.</v>

842
00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:48.623
<v Speaker 1>I'm going over some of the more complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>material might make them feel slightly </v>

843
00:48:52.261 --> 00:48:54.780
<v Speaker 1>worse in the short term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the long term payoff is very,</v>

844
00:48:54.781 --> 00:48:56.250
<v Speaker 1>very high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

845
00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:57.773
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

846
00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:00.603
<v Speaker 1>that's what I would recommend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Encourage him to go talk to somebody he </v>

847
00:49:03.491 --> 00:49:04.324
<v Speaker 1>knew and he needs to make the planning </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to come to terms with what's </v>

848
00:49:06.131 --> 00:49:08.860
<v Speaker 1>happened to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He needs to make a plan and he might</v>

849
00:49:08.861 --> 00:49:12.190
<v Speaker 1>need to talk to somebody for a long time</v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out what the hell's going on.</v>

850
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:14.820
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we also don't want to rule out,</v>

851
00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:15.673
<v Speaker 1>neither does he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The possibility that there's something </v>

852
00:49:16.871 --> 00:49:18.460
<v Speaker 1>physical wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

853
00:49:18.461 --> 00:49:19.294
<v Speaker 1>because there's increasing evidence that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the depressive disorders and that would </v>

854
00:49:22.610 --> 00:49:25.180
<v Speaker 1>include anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are consequence of,</v>

855
00:49:25.181 --> 00:49:28.180
<v Speaker 1>of such conditions as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as generalized inflammation.</v>

856
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:29.223
<v Speaker 1>And that's really worth looking into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think a lot of the things that we </v>

857
00:49:31.871 --> 00:49:36.100
<v Speaker 1>think are psychological have a more </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronounced physical basis.</v>

858
00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:38.110
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

859
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:43.770
<v Speaker 1>How do you dress so well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any tips?</v>

860
00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

861
00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:47.580
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

862
00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:49.040
<v Speaker 1>I started buying</v>

863
00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:53.480
<v Speaker 1>nice clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say this year.</v>

864
00:49:53.481 --> 00:49:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had some decent suits before that.</v>

865
00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:57.583
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did some research online to find out </v>

866
00:49:59.001 --> 00:50:01.460
<v Speaker 1>who good suit manufacturers where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can look that up.</v>

867
00:50:01.850 --> 00:50:05.930
<v Speaker 1>But in before this tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went and talked to a good tailor,</v>

868
00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:07.053
<v Speaker 1>a expensive place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt terrible spending so much money </v>

869
00:50:09.651 --> 00:50:11.070
<v Speaker 1>on clothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

870
00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:14.180
<v Speaker 1>but I felt that if I was going to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to,</v>

871
00:50:14.181 --> 00:50:17.930
<v Speaker 1>it's been 200,000 people that I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do it right and,</v>

872
00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:20.510
<v Speaker 1>and I was going to invest in some decent</v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes.</v>

873
00:50:20.511 --> 00:50:22.370
<v Speaker 1>And even though it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hurt my,</v>

874
00:50:22.810 --> 00:50:25.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheap northern Alberta soul to do it,</v>

875
00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:28.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was definitely worth it.</v>

876
00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:31.510
<v Speaker 1>So go talk to someone who knows what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>

877
00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Go talk to an actual Taylor and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

878
00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:34.813
<v Speaker 1>and you can do some research online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of resources online that </v>

879
00:50:41.211 --> 00:50:45.080
<v Speaker 1>are devoted towards devoted to helping </v>
<v Speaker 1>men figure out how to dress.</v>

880
00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:46.760
<v Speaker 1>Three piece suits look pretty good.</v>

881
00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:51.580
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got them tailored and fitted,</v>

882
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:55.060
<v Speaker 1>so they're not bespoke suits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're off the rack,</v>

883
00:50:55.061 --> 00:50:57.800
<v Speaker 1>but they've been tailored and that makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big difference.</v>

884
00:50:57.820 --> 00:50:59.770
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this subtle things that Taylor's do,</v>

885
00:50:59.771 --> 00:51:03.040
<v Speaker 1>they tuck it in around the waist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they cut it to your body.</v>

886
00:51:03.041 --> 00:51:03.874
<v Speaker 1>All of those things help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really good to have a good pair of </v>

887
00:51:05.441 --> 00:51:07.450
<v Speaker 1>shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Couple of Nice ties.</v>

888
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:11.130
<v Speaker 1>I learned how to tie off full Windsor </v>
<v Speaker 1>Knot recently and that actually helps.</v>

889
00:51:11.131 --> 00:51:13.120
<v Speaker 1>So you don't want your tire to look too </v>
<v Speaker 1>skinny.</v>

890
00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:14.463
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of people have been dressing up to </v>

891
00:51:15.281 --> 00:51:16.114
<v Speaker 1>come to my talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's nice to see a lot of young men </v>

892
00:51:18.191 --> 00:51:20.710
<v Speaker 1>come well dressed often in three piece </v>
<v Speaker 1>suits,</v>

893
00:51:20.711 --> 00:51:23.050
<v Speaker 1>but not always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's really good to see them dressed</v>

894
00:51:23.051 --> 00:51:25.090
<v Speaker 1>like grown ups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a real plus.</v>

895
00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:26.223
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a rule that I didn't write in 12 </v>

896
00:51:28.961 --> 00:51:29.794
<v Speaker 1>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was dressed like the person you </v>

897
00:51:30.791 --> 00:51:31.624
<v Speaker 1>want to be.</v>

898
00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:34.690
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of took that from Carl from,</v>

899
00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:39.750
<v Speaker 1>from nature because Nisha said every </v>
<v Speaker 1>great man is an actor of his own ideal.</v>

900
00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:41.970
<v Speaker 1>So very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eight for Islam.</v>

901
00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:42.813
<v Speaker 1>And basically what it meant was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you have to act out what you </v>

902
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:49.660
<v Speaker 1>want to be before you become it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to pretend,</v>

903
00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:51.400
<v Speaker 1>and it's not a lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

904
00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:52.293
<v Speaker 1>it's really a pretense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like children pretend to be a father </v>

905
00:51:55.001 --> 00:51:56.740
<v Speaker 1>before they grow up and become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>farther,</v>

906
00:51:56.741 --> 00:52:01.300
<v Speaker 1>it's a form of practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so tip one might be,</v>

907
00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:02.973
<v Speaker 1>I figured out who you want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tip Two might be well then dressed like </v>

908
00:52:05.981 --> 00:52:07.720
<v Speaker 1>that person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good start.</v>

909
00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:10.930
<v Speaker 1>And because I think if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become who you want to be,</v>

910
00:52:10.931 --> 00:52:15.931
<v Speaker 1>then no detail is too small to overlook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And certainly it isn't exactly that.</v>

911
00:52:16.421 --> 00:52:18.790
<v Speaker 1>People judge you by their clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buy your clothes,</v>

912
00:52:18.791 --> 00:52:21.460
<v Speaker 1>although they do to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that</v>

913
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:27.020
<v Speaker 1>if whatever you can have going for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might as well have going for you.</v>

914
00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:27.883
<v Speaker 1>That's how it looks to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And certainly my experience has been </v>

915
00:52:30.381 --> 00:52:31.214
<v Speaker 1>that the response to my improved </v>
<v Speaker 1>wardrobe has indicated that the </v>

916
00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:38.290
<v Speaker 1>investment was clearly worth it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

917
00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.233
<v Speaker 1>indisputably and clearly worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's nice to be dressed sharply to </v>

918
00:52:43.011 --> 00:52:46.340
<v Speaker 1>go in front of an audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a sign of respect to the audience.</v>

919
00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:48.380
<v Speaker 1>There's other ways of showing respect to</v>
<v Speaker 1>an audience,</v>

920
00:52:48.381 --> 00:52:49.214
<v Speaker 1>but that's certainly one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's been extraordinarily </v>

921
00:52:51.471 --> 00:52:52.304
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say if you're going for a job </v>

922
00:52:54.231 --> 00:52:55.064
<v Speaker 1>interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're at any critical point in your </v>

923
00:52:57.321 --> 00:52:58.154
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you should dress the part because </v>

924
00:52:59.721 --> 00:53:02.750
<v Speaker 1>you want to do everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can tip the scales in.</v>

925
00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:03.793
<v Speaker 1>Not In your favor exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in favor of having the right thing </v>

926
00:53:06.081 --> 00:53:07.610
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

927
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:11.300
<v Speaker 1>you have written an article on how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>write.</v>

928
00:53:11.301 --> 00:53:15.160
<v Speaker 1>Can you do the same on how to speak?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

929
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:18.050
<v Speaker 1>I suppose I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could tell you a little bit about it.</v>

930
00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:19.493
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

931
00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:23.840
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to speak about </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

932
00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:25.663
<v Speaker 1>you need to know a lot about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to know three or four times as </v>

933
00:53:28.261 --> 00:53:30.390
<v Speaker 1>much as you're going to speak about at </v>
<v Speaker 1>minimum.</v>

934
00:53:30.391 --> 00:53:32.850
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do your background research.</v>

935
00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:38.540
<v Speaker 1>You have to have multiple stories at </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand that you can use to illustrate your</v>

936
00:53:39.091 --> 00:53:40.680
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to have a point,</v>

937
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:44.460
<v Speaker 1>you have to organize what you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about around a problem.</v>

938
00:53:44.461 --> 00:53:48.990
<v Speaker 1>So before I go on stage to speak on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>tour,</v>

939
00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:50.363
<v Speaker 1>I always sit for half an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of which involves usually about </v>

940
00:53:52.921 --> 00:53:55.380
<v Speaker 1>five minutes of anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

941
00:53:55.381 --> 00:53:57.510
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a problem.</v>

942
00:53:57.511 --> 00:54:00.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to address tonight a central </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem or a theme,</v>

943
00:54:00.991 --> 00:54:02.400
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be courage.</v>

944
00:54:02.401 --> 00:54:04.860
<v Speaker 1>It might be responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be meaning.</v>

945
00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:06.173
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that serves as an organizing </v>

946
00:54:08.641 --> 00:54:10.350
<v Speaker 1>principle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be the point.</v>

947
00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:15.890
<v Speaker 1>And then basically I organize say a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dozen stories around that and I can kind</v>

948
00:54:16.231 --> 00:54:21.231
<v Speaker 1>of arrange them in it as a journey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a journey that circles the main</v>

949
00:54:21.811 --> 00:54:22.644
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm trying to explore it to say </v>

950
00:54:24.991 --> 00:54:27.000
<v Speaker 1>what I think about courage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

951
00:54:27.001 --> 00:54:31.140
<v Speaker 1>but to take what I'm thinking farther </v>
<v Speaker 1>than I've taken it already.</v>

952
00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:33.560
<v Speaker 1>And so then I can plot out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

953
00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:38.370
<v Speaker 1>little five minute stories that I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are associated with courage.</v>

954
00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:43.650
<v Speaker 1>And then I can talk to the audience and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

955
00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:45.420
<v Speaker 1>talk about what you know,</v>

956
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.430
<v Speaker 1>use your personal experience because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

957
00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:51.680
<v Speaker 1>that's something that you're actually a </v>
<v Speaker 1>master of.</v>

958
00:54:51.681 --> 00:54:52.514
<v Speaker 1>You can bring in other material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has to be tied to the real world </v>

959
00:54:56.151 --> 00:54:58.790
<v Speaker 1>through your own experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise it's not real.</v>

960
00:54:59.690 --> 00:55:02.690
<v Speaker 1>It's also very good to speak directly to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the audience,</v>

961
00:55:02.691 --> 00:55:03.524
<v Speaker 1>to the individuals in the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I'm always looking at a single </v>

962
00:55:05.631 --> 00:55:06.464
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one after another and focusing on them </v>

963
00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:12.110
<v Speaker 1>and talking to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like you'd have a conversation with</v>

964
00:55:12.111 --> 00:55:12.944
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that way I can see if they're </v>

965
00:55:14.001 --> 00:55:17.210
<v Speaker 1>following along and I'm always listening</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the audience.</v>

966
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:20.990
<v Speaker 1>What I really like to hear from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience is no noise at all.</v>

967
00:55:20.991 --> 00:55:23.690
<v Speaker 1>Silence because of the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially,</v>

968
00:55:23.691 --> 00:55:24.524
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's a couple of hundred or a couple </v>

969
00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:28.550
<v Speaker 1>of thousand people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the audience is dead silent,</v>

970
00:55:28.850 --> 00:55:33.110
<v Speaker 1>then I know that I'm on the right track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

971
00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:40.890
<v Speaker 1>the other thing I would say is you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling stories.</v>

972
00:55:41.490 --> 00:55:46.440
<v Speaker 1>So every fact that you relate or every </v>
<v Speaker 1>set of facts has to be tied to a story.</v>

973
00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:47.513
<v Speaker 1>There has to be a meaningful output,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something like why is it </v>

974
00:55:52.021 --> 00:55:54.660
<v Speaker 1>important to your life that you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>this fact?</v>

975
00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:58.200
<v Speaker 1>How is it related to how you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>conduct yourself moving forward?</v>

976
00:55:58.201 --> 00:55:59.034
<v Speaker 1>Or how are you going to see the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of the essence of </v>

977
00:56:00.931 --> 00:56:01.764
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does this fact change the way you </v>

978
00:56:03.631 --> 00:56:07.190
<v Speaker 1>perceive the world or act in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the meaning of the fact.</v>

979
00:56:07.191 --> 00:56:10.620
<v Speaker 1>And facts without meaning are dull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need to know that.</v>

980
00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:14.160
<v Speaker 1>You need to tell the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

981
00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:15.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

982
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.870
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mean for me,</v>

983
00:56:18.871 --> 00:56:19.704
<v Speaker 1>my talks are really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're an attempt to explore a set of </v>

984
00:56:22.291 --> 00:56:25.030
<v Speaker 1>ideas in the most truthful way that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can manage.</v>

985
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:25.863
<v Speaker 1>And that's also an adventure because </v>
<v Speaker 1>letting yourself speak freely about a </v>

986
00:56:30.671 --> 00:56:31.504
<v Speaker 1>topic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't always know where it's going </v>

987
00:56:32.011 --> 00:56:32.920
<v Speaker 1>to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

988
00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:35.890
<v Speaker 1>but that also hooks in the audience </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're not,</v>

989
00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:37.840
<v Speaker 1>they're along for the ride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

990
00:56:37.841 --> 00:56:40.540
<v Speaker 1>And there's a risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Risk is you might forget where you are,</v>

991
00:56:40.541 --> 00:56:43.120
<v Speaker 1>you might lose the thread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might say something you regret,</v>

992
00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:46.180
<v Speaker 1>you might get confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's this,</v>

993
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:49.060
<v Speaker 1>the talk should be a process of </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration,</v>

994
00:56:49.061 --> 00:56:51.580
<v Speaker 1>like a journey that you're taking the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience along on.</v>

995
00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:53.470
<v Speaker 1>It's the same when you're reading a </v>
<v Speaker 1>novel,</v>

996
00:56:53.471 --> 00:56:58.471
<v Speaker 1>like a great novel isn't exactly plotted</v>
<v Speaker 1>out from beginning to end to begin with.</v>

997
00:56:59.110 --> 00:56:59.943
<v Speaker 1>The author is taking himself or herself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you on an intellectual adventure </v>

998
00:57:06.191 --> 00:57:07.024
<v Speaker 1>through the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the character development and </v>

999
00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:11.740
<v Speaker 1>the characters have to be allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live and to express themselves.</v>

1000
00:57:11.741 --> 00:57:12.574
<v Speaker 1>And the novel needs to unfold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a color coy between the </v>

1001
00:57:16.031 --> 00:57:19.060
<v Speaker 1>conscious mind and the unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>source of inspiration.</v>

1002
00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:23.350
<v Speaker 1>And the novel is actually a journey </v>
<v Speaker 1>through a character,</v>

1003
00:57:23.351 --> 00:57:27.190
<v Speaker 1>a logical landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the author's shouldn't know where he</v>

1004
00:57:27.191 --> 00:57:29.200
<v Speaker 1>or she is going to end up at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>

1005
00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:32.920
<v Speaker 1>Same with an artist and who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's writing a song or,</v>

1006
00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:35.560
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a piece of music or a piece of visual</v>

1007
00:57:35.561 --> 00:57:36.394
<v Speaker 1>art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There has to be play and exploration </v>

1008
00:57:38.411 --> 00:57:42.370
<v Speaker 1>along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you also don't want to deliver an</v>

1009
00:57:42.371 --> 00:57:46.060
<v Speaker 1>overprepared talk in my estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least that's not how I do it.</v>

1010
00:57:46.061 --> 00:57:46.894
<v Speaker 1>You want to have a theme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to have a body of knowledge </v>

1011
00:57:49.331 --> 00:57:50.164
<v Speaker 1>from which you can draw on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you want to be actively </v>

1012
00:57:51.911 --> 00:57:54.850
<v Speaker 1>exploring the idea in front of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

1013
00:57:55.210 --> 00:57:57.880
<v Speaker 1>And that's very gripping for everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including you.</v>

1014
00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:58.833
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you should learn something from the </v>

1015
00:58:00.011 --> 00:58:00.844
<v Speaker 1>talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an opportunity to think on your </v>

1016
00:58:02.081 --> 00:58:04.030
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And anyways,</v>

1017
00:58:04.031 --> 00:58:05.860
<v Speaker 1>that's my style of lecturing.</v>

1018
00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:07.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1019
00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:11.200
<v Speaker 1>it's a trapeze act without a safety net,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

1020
00:58:11.201 --> 00:58:12.034
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of what makes it </v>
<v Speaker 1>gripping is that there's a high </v>

1021
00:58:15.071 --> 00:58:15.904
<v Speaker 1>probability of failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say with any performance </v>

1022
00:58:19.930 --> 00:58:23.500
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>gripping,</v>

1023
00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:26.043
<v Speaker 1>that on the edge of the seat gripping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there has to be a high probability of </v>

1024
00:58:28.841 --> 00:58:30.970
<v Speaker 1>failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I don't speak with notes.</v>

1025
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:33.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you speak with notes,</v>

1026
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:35.770
<v Speaker 1>which you might have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a beginning speaker,</v>

1027
00:58:36.010 --> 00:58:40.090
<v Speaker 1>then you can not fail because you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>always read the notes.</v>

1028
00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:41.590
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a nap,</v>

1029
00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:43.420
<v Speaker 1>you'll fall in the net,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you won't die,</v>

1030
00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:45.610
<v Speaker 1>but you'll never do anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectacular.</v>

1031
00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:49.420
<v Speaker 1>So that's the thing is if you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do something spectacular,</v>

1032
00:58:49.421 --> 00:58:52.030
<v Speaker 1>you have to take the risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're going to take the risk,</v>

1033
00:58:52.031 --> 00:58:54.790
<v Speaker 1>you have to think on your feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you also have to have something</v>

1034
00:58:54.791 --> 00:58:55.330
<v Speaker 1>to think about.</v>

1035
00:58:55.330 --> 00:58:57.310
<v Speaker 1>You have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been working on this material.</v>

1036
00:58:57.311 --> 00:58:58.144
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been working on this stuff I talk </v>

1037
00:58:59.051 --> 00:59:02.920
<v Speaker 1>about for 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for tens of thousands of hours.</v>

1038
00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:06.910
<v Speaker 1>And so I have that reservoir of </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>

1039
00:59:06.911 --> 00:59:08.080
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1040
00:59:08.081 --> 00:59:08.914
<v Speaker 1>whenever I read something new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm slotting it into the node structure </v>

1041
00:59:11.651 --> 00:59:12.484
<v Speaker 1>that I use to generate my talks and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading all the time and lots of the </v>

1042
00:59:16.391 --> 00:59:17.980
<v Speaker 1>things I read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget.</v>

1043
00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:20.500
<v Speaker 1>They're not relevant to my central </v>
<v Speaker 1>mission,</v>

1044
00:59:20.501 --> 00:59:22.770
<v Speaker 1>whatever that happens to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like some,</v>

1045
00:59:22.850 --> 00:59:23.683
<v Speaker 1>it looks something like the delineation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the relationship between </v>

1046
00:59:27.081 --> 00:59:27.914
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and meaning and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe responsibility meaning and </v>

1047
00:59:31.641 --> 00:59:33.140
<v Speaker 1>perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

1048
00:59:33.141 --> 00:59:37.400
<v Speaker 1>And so I have a central concern or </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeper than that in some sense.</v>

1049
00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:38.853
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my central concern was how do ensure </v>

1050
00:59:42.171 --> 00:59:47.171
<v Speaker 1>personally that if I was tempted in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation like the situations that arose</v>

1051
00:59:48.201 --> 00:59:49.034
<v Speaker 1>in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I wouldn't fall prey to those </v>

1052
00:59:53.901 --> 00:59:57.920
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian systems and act in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible manner that so many people</v>

1053
00:59:57.921 --> 00:59:58.754
<v Speaker 1>act at the end.</v>

1054
00:59:58.910 --> 01:00:01.070
<v Speaker 1>That's really been a driving concern of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mine.</v>

1055
01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:02.233
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's bleeds over into the </v>

1056
01:00:03.621 --> 01:00:06.530
<v Speaker 1>relationship between meaning and </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and perception.</v>

1057
01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:07.603
<v Speaker 1>So there's a core set of problems that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm working on in every talk is an </v>

1058
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:13.880
<v Speaker 1>attempt to further develop those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you also have to have a problem.</v>

1059
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:17.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

1060
01:00:17.181 --> 01:00:18.680
<v Speaker 1>well you don't want to have a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1061
01:00:18.681 --> 01:00:19.281
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do,</v>

1062
01:00:19.281 --> 01:00:20.250
<v Speaker 1>you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to,</v>

1063
01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:23.840
<v Speaker 1>you've got problems anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're alive,</v>

1064
01:00:23.841 --> 01:00:25.670
<v Speaker 1>you've got problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pick one of them.</v>

1065
01:00:25.671 --> 01:00:27.890
<v Speaker 1>It can be your problem and that can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem.</v>

1066
01:00:27.891 --> 01:00:30.380
<v Speaker 1>You try to address whatever that happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>

1067
01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:32.300
<v Speaker 1>And then you have something to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1068
01:00:32.301 --> 01:00:35.480
<v Speaker 1>How am I going to address this problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can this problem be addressed?</v>

1069
01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:37.213
<v Speaker 1>So you need to have a problem too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to talk just like you </v>

1070
01:00:38.781 --> 01:00:39.614
<v Speaker 1>need to have a problem if you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to write because the writing is an </v>

1071
01:00:41.151 --> 01:00:43.940
<v Speaker 1>attempt to solve the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so is there talking.</v>

1072
01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:47.360
<v Speaker 1>If you're not trying to solve a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell are you doing talking?</v>

1073
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:51.290
<v Speaker 1>Why should anyone care?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be a real problem to like,</v>

1074
01:00:51.291 --> 01:00:52.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1075
01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:55.250
<v Speaker 1>a nail biter of a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dragon have a problem.</v>

1076
01:00:55.790 --> 01:00:58.280
<v Speaker 1>And if it's a problem that everyone else</v>
<v Speaker 1>shares so much,</v>

1077
01:00:58.281 --> 01:00:59.930
<v Speaker 1>the better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1078
01:01:00.370 --> 01:01:02.420
<v Speaker 1>and then you grapple with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1079
01:01:10.030 --> 01:01:10.863
<v Speaker 1>thoughts on the eastern idea of moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from excessive thinking into the </v>

1080
01:01:14.171 --> 01:01:18.190
<v Speaker 1>awareness beyond thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>removing it from the driver's seat to be</v>

1081
01:01:18.191 --> 01:01:20.320
<v Speaker 1>used more as a tool?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1082
01:01:20.321 --> 01:01:24.040
<v Speaker 1>well I thought a lot about this in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to</v>

1083
01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:29.470
<v Speaker 1>a couple of ancient ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one Mesopotamia and idea,</v>

1084
01:01:29.770 --> 01:01:34.130
<v Speaker 1>a characterization of Marduk who was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>highest Mesopotamian Daddy.</v>

1085
01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:35.673
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was Marta who carved up the goddess </v>

1086
01:01:38.111 --> 01:01:38.944
<v Speaker 1>of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tie Amat into pieces and made the world </v>

1087
01:01:42.311 --> 01:01:43.144
<v Speaker 1>out of her pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Martech is the force that confronts </v>

1088
01:01:45.281 --> 01:01:49.780
<v Speaker 1>chaos and builds habitable order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the logos in genesis.</v>

1089
01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:53.890
<v Speaker 1>And one of Martex attributes was that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>had eyes all the way around his head and</v>

1090
01:01:53.891 --> 01:01:56.920
<v Speaker 1>that he could speak magic words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those two attributes,</v>

1091
01:01:56.921 --> 01:01:57.754
<v Speaker 1>but it's the eyes they that are of most </v>
<v Speaker 1>crucial importance with regard to this </v>

1092
01:02:01.001 --> 01:02:02.860
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's horus,</v>

1093
01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:06.730
<v Speaker 1>the Egyptian God who's the famous I and </v>
<v Speaker 1>horses,</v>

1094
01:02:06.731 --> 01:02:09.120
<v Speaker 1>really a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1095
01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:12.490
<v Speaker 1>what a day of vacation of attention I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would say.</v>

1096
01:02:12.910 --> 01:02:15.640
<v Speaker 1>And there's a difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention and thinking.</v>

1097
01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:18.310
<v Speaker 1>Like let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me give you an example.</v>

1098
01:02:18.311 --> 01:02:23.311
<v Speaker 1>So thinking to be instrumental mostly so</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your thing,</v>

1099
01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:26.250
<v Speaker 1>but people also often say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what's your,</v>

1100
01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:28.980
<v Speaker 1>what's your strategy when you go into an</v>
<v Speaker 1>interview?</v>

1101
01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:31.190
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1102
01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:34.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a strategy when I go into </v>
<v Speaker 1>an interview because I'm there to have a</v>

1103
01:02:34.621 --> 01:02:35.454
<v Speaker 1>conversation and I'm not sure where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation will go and I'm willing to </v>

1104
01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:41.490
<v Speaker 1>let it go wherever it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not there to sell books,</v>

1105
01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:43.890
<v Speaker 1>although I'm perfectly happy if more </v>
<v Speaker 1>books sell because,</v>

1106
01:02:44.190 --> 01:02:45.023
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because obviously I wrote a book and I </v>

1107
01:02:47.041 --> 01:02:49.890
<v Speaker 1>want people to read it and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole enterprise behind it.</v>

1108
01:02:49.891 --> 01:02:52.950
<v Speaker 1>And so it's also my responsibility to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>the marketing properly.</v>

1109
01:02:52.951 --> 01:02:56.860
<v Speaker 1>But I'm not going to do these interviews</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sell books or to promote myself or,</v>

1110
01:02:57.050 --> 01:02:57.883
<v Speaker 1>or I don't have a strategic goal in mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>except that I'm going to have a </v>

1111
01:03:02.761 --> 01:03:06.360
<v Speaker 1>conversation and I'm going to say what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think and,</v>

1112
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:07.223
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and take the consequences because I </v>

1113
01:03:08.551 --> 01:03:12.420
<v Speaker 1>assumed that if I say something and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it's true,</v>

1114
01:03:12.421 --> 01:03:13.254
<v Speaker 1>then the consequences are as positive as</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can be regardless of how they look </v>

1115
01:03:16.471 --> 01:03:17.304
<v Speaker 1>at the time.</v>

1116
01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:18.503
<v Speaker 1>And that's an issue of faith because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that the habitable order is </v>

1117
01:03:23.191 --> 01:03:26.130
<v Speaker 1>generated by spoken truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that.</v>

1118
01:03:26.131 --> 01:03:28.770
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the truest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the truest thing.</v>

1119
01:03:28.771 --> 01:03:31.170
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1120
01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:34.193
<v Speaker 1>and so I go into the interview and I did</v>
<v Speaker 1>this in my clinical practice and I try </v>

1121
01:03:37.631 --> 01:03:39.300
<v Speaker 1>to do this when I'm talking to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

1122
01:03:39.301 --> 01:03:40.134
<v Speaker 1>is that I'm not thinking about where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation is going or what point I </v>

1123
01:03:43.591 --> 01:03:46.080
<v Speaker 1>want to make or what I want the outcome </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>

1124
01:03:46.081 --> 01:03:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just let that go.</v>

1125
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:49.463
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's within this broader framework of </v>

1126
01:03:50.491 --> 01:03:51.324
<v Speaker 1>assuming that the truth is the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>effective means of progressing and then </v>

1127
01:03:55.501 --> 01:03:56.334
<v Speaker 1>I pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happens when you pay attention </v>

1128
01:03:59.461 --> 01:04:00.294
<v Speaker 1>is that while you're watching a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a great treatment for social </v>

1129
01:04:03.811 --> 01:04:04.680
<v Speaker 1>anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1130
01:04:04.681 --> 01:04:05.514
<v Speaker 1>because if you're socially anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tend not to pay attention to the </v>

1131
01:04:07.261 --> 01:04:07.770
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1132
01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:11.340
<v Speaker 1>Pay attention to who you're talking to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch them like a hawk,</v>

1133
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:12.263
<v Speaker 1>like not paranoid or anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not too intently because you make </v>

1134
01:04:15.031 --> 01:04:15.864
<v Speaker 1>them uncomfortable but intently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pay attention to what they're saying to </v>

1135
01:04:19.441 --> 01:04:23.370
<v Speaker 1>how they look to their facial gestures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that look at their face and watch</v>

1136
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:26.910
<v Speaker 1>and listen and try to understand what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying.</v>

1137
01:04:26.911 --> 01:04:29.910
<v Speaker 1>And what you'll see is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well questions pop into your mind.</v>

1138
01:04:29.911 --> 01:04:30.331
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1139
01:04:30.331 --> 01:04:32.580
<v Speaker 1>I didn't understand what you said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you clarify that?</v>

1140
01:04:32.581 --> 01:04:35.310
<v Speaker 1>And it sounds like you mean this is this</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you mean?</v>

1141
01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:39.090
<v Speaker 1>But not in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll put you on the spot because I think</v>

1142
01:04:39.091 --> 01:04:39.924
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong sort of way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a clarification sort of way and </v>

1143
01:04:42.661 --> 01:04:46.800
<v Speaker 1>all of that attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what I'm doing clinical work with</v>

1144
01:04:46.801 --> 01:04:49.200
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the reason I quit by the way</v>

1145
01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:51.900
<v Speaker 1>about a year ago is because I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to get distracted.</v>

1146
01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:52.733
<v Speaker 1>I had a rule which was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have an hour with me and I do </v>

1147
01:04:54.481 --> 01:04:55.314
<v Speaker 1>nothing but pay attention to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not thinking about what I wanted to </v>

1148
01:04:58.641 --> 01:04:59.474
<v Speaker 1>accomplish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not thinking about the problems in </v>

1149
01:05:01.201 --> 01:05:03.030
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not distracted.</v>

1150
01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:06.450
<v Speaker 1>And I listened to you and I ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions when I don't understand.</v>

1151
01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:08.160
<v Speaker 1>And if a thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1152
01:05:08.161 --> 01:05:10.470
<v Speaker 1>occurs to me while I'm paying attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you,</v>

1153
01:05:10.471 --> 01:05:13.920
<v Speaker 1>then I'll tell you what it is you see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

1154
01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:19.160
<v Speaker 1>that's using awareness primarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking secondarily like I don't think,</v>

1155
01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:22.083
<v Speaker 1>well here's what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how I want to cure this person and I'm </v>

1156
01:05:23.951 --> 01:05:24.784
<v Speaker 1>going to maneuver them into certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>responses by using these communicative </v>

1157
01:05:29.321 --> 01:05:30.154
<v Speaker 1>tools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to pay attention to </v>

1158
01:05:31.331 --> 01:05:34.900
<v Speaker 1>this person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to discuss where we're going</v>

1159
01:05:34.901 --> 01:05:37.360
<v Speaker 1>and why I'm going to listen to what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

1160
01:05:37.361 --> 01:05:41.350
<v Speaker 1>And then when they're talking things are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to occur within me.</v>

1161
01:05:41.350 --> 01:05:42.183
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to see images and thoughts are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to emerge from the background and </v>

1162
01:05:47.831 --> 01:05:48.664
<v Speaker 1>then I'll share them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not always because I usually have more </v>

1163
01:05:52.091 --> 01:05:52.924
<v Speaker 1>thoughts than can be shared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if a thought comes up and it seems </v>

1164
01:05:55.751 --> 01:05:58.960
<v Speaker 1>like an interesting reaction to what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>person just said,</v>

1165
01:05:58.961 --> 01:06:03.010
<v Speaker 1>then I'll just tell them and sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>without commitment to it.</v>

1166
01:06:03.070 --> 01:06:03.903
<v Speaker 1>And it's usually okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just said this and so this question </v>

1167
01:06:07.091 --> 01:06:08.980
<v Speaker 1>emerged so we need to straighten that </v>
<v Speaker 1>out cause I'm,</v>

1168
01:06:08.981 --> 01:06:12.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or You said this and I had this image or</v>

1169
01:06:12.761 --> 01:06:17.761
<v Speaker 1>you said this and this thought came to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind and it seems to be this is this.</v>

1170
01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:20.393
<v Speaker 1>So that's one person's reaction to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that you're conducting yourself at </v>

1171
01:06:23.861 --> 01:06:25.510
<v Speaker 1>the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1172
01:06:27.290 --> 01:06:27.590
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1173
01:06:27.590 --> 01:06:29.870
<v Speaker 1>thinking is instrumental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I outline this in,</v>

1174
01:06:30.110 --> 01:06:33.260
<v Speaker 1>I think it's rule seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do what is meaningful,</v>

1175
01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:36.770
<v Speaker 1>not what is expedient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do what's expedient,</v>

1176
01:06:36.771 --> 01:06:37.604
<v Speaker 1>you have a short term conscious goal in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind and you try to bend everything </v>

1177
01:06:41.061 --> 01:06:41.894
<v Speaker 1>towards that end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're pursuing what's </v>

1178
01:06:44.511 --> 01:06:45.344
<v Speaker 1>meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you just pay attention to what's </v>

1179
01:06:47.391 --> 01:06:52.391
<v Speaker 1>going on and you react with truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's,</v>

1180
01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:55.070
<v Speaker 1>that's a much better way of living as </v>
<v Speaker 1>far as I'm concerned.</v>

1181
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:57.950
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a much more powerful way of living.</v>

1182
01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:02.660
<v Speaker 1>It means you have to confront things </v>
<v Speaker 1>right then in there,</v>

1183
01:07:03.590 --> 01:07:06.830
<v Speaker 1>which is I suppose why so many of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>interviews have been,</v>

1184
01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:12.040
<v Speaker 1>in some sense contra confrontational </v>
<v Speaker 1>because people will impose in,</v>

1185
01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:12.953
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking agenda on the flow of the </v>

1186
01:07:14.481 --> 01:07:15.314
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is especially true in the </v>

1187
01:07:16.371 --> 01:07:17.204
<v Speaker 1>mainstream media happened again recently</v>
<v Speaker 1>with bbcs hard talk that they impose an </v>

1188
01:07:22.431 --> 01:07:25.580
<v Speaker 1>agenda on the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that just doesn't work out very</v>

1189
01:07:25.581 --> 01:07:26.414
<v Speaker 1>well because</v>

1190
01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:32.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm paying attention and I will object </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the agenda.</v>

1191
01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Not because I haven't different agenda </v>
<v Speaker 1>except for what I said,</v>

1192
01:07:38.361 --> 01:07:43.361
<v Speaker 1>which is that I want to say what I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say as truthfully as I can.</v>

1193
01:07:43.461 --> 01:07:44.294
<v Speaker 1>What I actually am thinking in this more</v>
<v Speaker 1>abstracted and detached sense and see </v>

1194
01:07:50.841 --> 01:07:53.920
<v Speaker 1>what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

1195
01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:57.920
<v Speaker 1>it's a hard thing to clarify because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>might say,</v>

1196
01:07:57.921 --> 01:07:58.754
<v Speaker 1>well Dr. Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just said you want to say what </v>

1197
01:08:01.041 --> 01:08:05.090
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not exactly the same thing.</v>

1198
01:08:05.091 --> 01:08:07.610
<v Speaker 1>It's not like I'm thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategically,</v>

1199
01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:13.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thoughts emerge and I say them.</v>

1200
01:08:14.330 --> 01:08:16.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not putting a spin on things.</v>

1201
01:08:16.881 --> 01:08:19.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to manipulate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation any particular way.</v>

1202
01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:23.720
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason for that is because I decided</v>

1203
01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:28.580
<v Speaker 1>a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably 30 years that there was no more</v>

1204
01:08:28.581 --> 01:08:29.414
<v Speaker 1>effective way of dealing with a complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation than to try to say what you </v>

1205
01:08:33.261 --> 01:08:36.470
<v Speaker 1>believe to be true and know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulate it.</v>

1206
01:08:36.530 --> 01:08:37.311
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of that.</v>

1207
01:08:37.311 --> 01:08:38.144
<v Speaker 1>It's just doesn't cause that's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are all lies as far as I'm </v>

1208
01:08:39.921 --> 01:08:42.080
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of manipulation and spin.</v>

1209
01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:43.513
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he was invited to the largest </v>

1210
01:08:53.190 --> 01:08:54.023
<v Speaker 1>possible number of games is also the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person that goes out to conquer the </v>

1211
01:08:56.551 --> 01:08:59.430
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could this lie and reciprocal altruism?</v>

1212
01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:03.480
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it almost certainly does.</v>

1213
01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:10.040
<v Speaker 1>You certainly see the reciprocal </v>
<v Speaker 1>altruism in being invited to the largest</v>

1214
01:09:10.771 --> 01:09:12.750
<v Speaker 1>possible number of games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a little background here,</v>

1215
01:09:12.751 --> 01:09:13.231
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1216
01:09:13.231 --> 01:09:16.050
<v Speaker 1>what's a winner?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or a winner is someone who wins a game.</v>

1217
01:09:16.290 --> 01:09:17.123
<v Speaker 1>It's like no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A winner is someone who gets invited to </v>

1218
01:09:19.411 --> 01:09:21.930
<v Speaker 1>play the largest possible number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>

1219
01:09:22.170 --> 01:09:24.510
<v Speaker 1>And that means that you have to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good sport.</v>

1220
01:09:24.511 --> 01:09:28.200
<v Speaker 1>And so the good sport is the winner in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the broader game in the metagame.</v>

1221
01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:29.453
<v Speaker 1>Now I put forward the proposition that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the winner of the Meta game is also the </v>

1222
01:09:33.901 --> 01:09:36.060
<v Speaker 1>person that goes out to conquer the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>

1223
01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Now let's see if we can take that apart </v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>

1224
01:09:39.181 --> 01:09:40.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>

1225
01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:43.950
<v Speaker 1>one of the attributes of being a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>sport,</v>

1226
01:09:43.951 --> 01:09:44.784
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you're trying to extend your </v>

1227
01:09:46.801 --> 01:09:47.634
<v Speaker 1>skill during the game and so you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>confronting the unknown in the game </v>

1228
01:09:51.061 --> 01:09:53.010
<v Speaker 1>because you're trying to get better at </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing the game.</v>

1229
01:09:53.670 --> 01:09:56.730
<v Speaker 1>And then you're also doing that in a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's of benefit to the team.</v>

1230
01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:00.360
<v Speaker 1>And so then you can imagine that being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>team leader in,</v>

1231
01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:01.383
<v Speaker 1>in the metagame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the game of extending your </v>

1232
01:10:02.941 --> 01:10:03.774
<v Speaker 1>skill across the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the broadest possible set of </v>

1233
01:10:05.821 --> 01:10:09.750
<v Speaker 1>games is analogous to leading a team </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the unknown.</v>

1234
01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:12.450
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going to go confront the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown,</v>

1235
01:10:12.451 --> 01:10:13.980
<v Speaker 1>you're probably not going to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone,</v>

1236
01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:17.340
<v Speaker 1>although you could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to some degree you have to be alone,</v>

1237
01:10:17.341 --> 01:10:21.330
<v Speaker 1>but you're generally going to do it in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperative and competitive way.</v>

1238
01:10:21.331 --> 01:10:25.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's why stories like the Lord </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the rings and the Hobbit for example,</v>

1239
01:10:25.111 --> 01:10:28.800
<v Speaker 1>and even Harry Potter for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of those people are alone.</v>

1240
01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:29.813
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lead or are part of a broader </v>

1241
01:10:32.251 --> 01:10:36.750
<v Speaker 1>social group and they're important and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're team players within that group.</v>

1242
01:10:37.290 --> 01:10:38.123
<v Speaker 1>So the team player element seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's common to conquering </v>

1243
01:10:41.041 --> 01:10:44.280
<v Speaker 1>the unknown and to reciprocal altruism </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1244
01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:46.860
<v Speaker 1>and to being invited to play the largest</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of games.</v>

1245
01:10:47.150 --> 01:10:51.000
<v Speaker 1>And the question then is what makes an </v>
<v Speaker 1>effective leader and an effective leader</v>

1246
01:10:51.001 --> 01:10:55.860
<v Speaker 1>is someone who is able to synthesize the</v>
<v Speaker 1>group and to lead it forward towards the</v>

1247
01:10:55.861 --> 01:10:56.820
<v Speaker 1>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1248
01:10:56.821 --> 01:10:57.840
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1249
01:10:57.841 --> 01:11:01.500
<v Speaker 1>when a game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously the good player is leading the</v>

1250
01:11:01.501 --> 01:11:04.900
<v Speaker 1>team forward to the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same in a quest.</v>

1251
01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:08.820
<v Speaker 1>The good player is the leader who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>leading the team towards the goal.</v>

1252
01:11:09.210 --> 01:11:12.420
<v Speaker 1>So there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a deep analogy there and</v>

1253
01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:16.813
<v Speaker 1>it's not just reciprocal altruism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's quite the right </v>

1254
01:11:21.051 --> 01:11:24.560
<v Speaker 1>terminology though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's an element of pragmatic</v>

1255
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.400
<v Speaker 1>competence that goes along with it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1256
01:11:30.530 --> 01:11:33.960
<v Speaker 1>You are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't merely be willing to engage in</v>

1257
01:11:33.961 --> 01:11:36.300
<v Speaker 1>reciprocal altruism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a good player</v>

1258
01:11:38.230 --> 01:11:39.063
<v Speaker 1>or to conquer the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also have to have skill and </v>

1259
01:11:41.171 --> 01:11:42.004
<v Speaker 1>discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say reciprocal altruism is </v>

1260
01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:48.040
<v Speaker 1>necessary but not sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 1>precondition,</v>

1261
01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:49.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talent,</v>

1262
01:11:49.710 --> 01:11:52.210
<v Speaker 1>scalability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those things,</v>

1263
01:11:52.211 --> 01:11:55.480
<v Speaker 1>our creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those things are also important.</v>

1264
01:11:56.020 --> 01:12:00.180
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a bit of an answer to that,</v>

1265
01:12:00.181 --> 01:12:01.530
<v Speaker 1>but it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good question.</v>

1266
01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:03.113
<v Speaker 1>So please confirm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a Harry Potter patroness </v>

1267
01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:10.260
<v Speaker 1>patronus would in fact be a frog?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need answers,</v>

1268
01:12:10.261 --> 01:12:12.210
<v Speaker 1>doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1269
01:12:12.211 --> 01:12:15.910
<v Speaker 1>you'd certainly think that wouldn't you</v>
<v Speaker 1>frog?</v>

1270
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:17.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's obvious.</v>

1271
01:12:17.681 --> 01:12:22.681
<v Speaker 1>It's gotta be a frog or maybe a lobster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have,</v>

1272
01:12:25.610 --> 01:12:27.350
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have guessed that it would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a frog,</v>

1273
01:12:27.351 --> 01:12:30.200
<v Speaker 1>but that certainly seems to be how </v>
<v Speaker 1>things have developed.</v>

1274
01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:34.450
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1275
01:12:34.451 --> 01:12:38.890
<v Speaker 1>a frog is in home at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on dry land and in the water</v>

1276
01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:42.013
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

1277
01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:44.553
<v Speaker 1>that makes the frog a kind of psychopomp</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've strived to be at home in the </v>

1278
01:12:49.781 --> 01:12:54.730
<v Speaker 1>air and in the water and to bring up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>gold ball from the bottom of the lake.</v>

1279
01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.230
<v Speaker 1>Like the frog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prince.</v>

1280
01:12:58.800 --> 01:12:59.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1281
01:12:59.670 --> 01:13:01.500
<v Speaker 1>definitely frog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1282
01:13:01.501 --> 01:13:02.670
<v Speaker 1>so you've got your answer.</v>

1283
01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:04.533
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

1284
01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:07.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got my answer too.</v>

1285
01:13:07.061 --> 01:13:10.630
<v Speaker 1>I guess</v>
<v Speaker 1>on completing,</v>

1286
01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:14.080
<v Speaker 1>understand myself.com I scored </v>
<v Speaker 1>exceptionally low,</v>

1287
01:13:14.081 --> 01:13:17.170
<v Speaker 1>zero and conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>industriousness and orderliness.</v>

1288
01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:19.960
<v Speaker 1>What can I do for motivation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1289
01:13:19.961 --> 01:13:22.180
<v Speaker 1>Dean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first question is how old are you?</v>

1290
01:13:22.181 --> 01:13:23.470
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1291
01:13:23.950 --> 01:13:26.380
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have an easier life if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still young.</v>

1292
01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:28.840
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're older and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>that score,</v>

1293
01:13:28.841 --> 01:13:31.280
<v Speaker 1>then that's going to be rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1294
01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:33.273
<v Speaker 1>perhaps you're high in openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which case you're going to derive </v>

1295
01:13:36.251 --> 01:13:39.790
<v Speaker 1>your motivation from engaging in </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative endeavors.</v>

1296
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:40.833
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps you're high in agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that you might find meaning </v>

1297
01:13:43.751 --> 01:13:46.630
<v Speaker 1>and caring for other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps extroversion,</v>

1298
01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:50.320
<v Speaker 1>which means you're going to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>engagement in being with other people.</v>

1299
01:13:51.010 --> 01:13:52.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1300
01:13:52.810 --> 01:13:55.180
<v Speaker 1>so those are potential sources of </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation.</v>

1301
01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:58.270
<v Speaker 1>You may have to look elsewhere then </v>
<v Speaker 1>duty,</v>

1302
01:13:58.450 --> 01:13:59.283
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it chievemeet ambition for your </v>

1303
01:14:01.931 --> 01:14:02.764
<v Speaker 1>primary sources of motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing I would caution you though is </v>

1304
01:14:06.311 --> 01:14:09.820
<v Speaker 1>that you likely need to make friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the scheduler.</v>

1305
01:14:09.821 --> 01:14:10.654
<v Speaker 1>Like Google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to design days you want to have and </v>

1306
01:14:14.141 --> 01:14:18.190
<v Speaker 1>to learn to structure your time because</v>

1307
01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:20.120
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1308
01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:23.150
<v Speaker 1>even if you're high in openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which makes you creative,</v>

1309
01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:24.193
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a hell of a time </v>

1310
01:14:25.011 --> 01:14:25.844
<v Speaker 1>sticking to things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe you need to partner with </v>

1311
01:14:30.021 --> 01:14:32.810
<v Speaker 1>someone who's I in conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1312
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:36.410
<v Speaker 1>but I would really recommend trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline yourself.</v>

1313
01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:37.250
<v Speaker 1>You use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1314
01:14:37.250 --> 01:14:38.083
<v Speaker 1>use Google calendar to design the days </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to have and learn to schedule </v>

1315
01:14:43.370 --> 01:14:48.370
<v Speaker 1>and regulate your time use because zero </v>
<v Speaker 1>is very low and my suspicions are you'll</v>

1316
01:14:50.541 --> 01:14:52.790
<v Speaker 1>pay quite a high price for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1317
01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:56.653
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about Ellis Miller and</v>
<v Speaker 1>her thesis that most psychological </v>

1318
01:14:59.031 --> 01:15:02.480
<v Speaker 1>diseases and the parent behavior as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>result of some kind of childhood trauma?</v>

1319
01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:03.613
<v Speaker 1>Some are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some forms of childhood trauma or </v>

1320
01:15:07.121 --> 01:15:10.850
<v Speaker 1>also a consequence of psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases and apparent behavior.</v>

1321
01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:12.890
<v Speaker 1>So this is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complicated.</v>

1322
01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:13.963
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm more on the existentialist front </v>

1323
01:15:16.041 --> 01:15:16.874
<v Speaker 1>with regards to these sorts of theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Ellis Miller's thesis is basically </v>

1324
01:15:19.641 --> 01:15:21.840
<v Speaker 1>Freudian Freud's thesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1325
01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:23.110
<v Speaker 1>Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1326
01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:24.223
<v Speaker 1>certainly posited that many forms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological distress where a </v>

1327
01:15:28.431 --> 01:15:31.790
<v Speaker 1>consequence of childhood trauma of </v>
<v Speaker 1>various sorts.</v>

1328
01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:33.013
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1329
01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:36.810
<v Speaker 1>I think the existentialist take on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is more accurate,</v>

1330
01:15:36.811 --> 01:15:37.644
<v Speaker 1>which is that life in and of itself is </v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently harsh and full of betrayal </v>

1331
01:15:43.561 --> 01:15:48.240
<v Speaker 1>and other forms of malevolence to cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>any number of psychological diseases and</v>

1332
01:15:48.241 --> 01:15:52.980
<v Speaker 1>produce any amount of a barren behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think it has to be,</v>

1333
01:15:53.010 --> 01:15:53.843
<v Speaker 1>it's not as if we all had childhoods </v>
<v Speaker 1>without trauma that we would have grown </v>

1334
01:15:56.551 --> 01:15:58.770
<v Speaker 1>up to be perfect adults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1335
01:15:59.170 --> 01:16:02.880
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also a disguised form of Rousseau</v>

1336
01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:06.480
<v Speaker 1>Indian philosophy and the Russo's </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy is people are basically good,</v>

1337
01:16:06.481 --> 01:16:10.500
<v Speaker 1>but culture makes them evil and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not true.</v>

1338
01:16:10.501 --> 01:16:13.830
<v Speaker 1>People are basically good and evil and </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

1339
01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:15.053
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fortifies the possibility of both add </v>

1340
01:16:17.941 --> 01:16:20.940
<v Speaker 1>strength to the possibility of both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1341
01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:22.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1342
01:16:22.710 --> 01:16:23.543
<v Speaker 1>I th I think that people are sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>damaged in childhood in ways that need </v>

1343
01:16:28.621 --> 01:16:31.770
<v Speaker 1>to be addressed in adulthood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that there are plenty,</v>

1344
01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:36.210
<v Speaker 1>plenty of other reasons for </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological and physical disorder.</v>

1345
01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:38.850
<v Speaker 1>Genetic causes,</v>

1346
01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:41.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1347
01:16:43.610 --> 01:16:46.370
<v Speaker 1>causes related to all sorts of physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases.</v>

1348
01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:48.140
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's way too simple.</v>

1349
01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:49.430
<v Speaker 1>It's way too simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

1350
01:16:49.650 --> 01:16:50.483
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hypothesis and it's caused an awful </v>

1351
01:16:52.041 --> 01:16:56.510
<v Speaker 1>lot of trouble because a lot of simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>minded therapists always assumed that if</v>

1352
01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:59.750
<v Speaker 1>someone is having psychological problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>in adulthood,</v>

1353
01:16:59.751 --> 01:17:00.584
<v Speaker 1>it must be because they had childhood </v>
<v Speaker 1>trauma and everybody has an unhappy </v>

1354
01:17:03.861 --> 01:17:06.380
<v Speaker 1>childhood to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can always find something.</v>

1355
01:17:06.710 --> 01:17:10.250
<v Speaker 1>And often the childhood trauma that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're looking for house to be sexual.</v>

1356
01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:11.233
<v Speaker 1>And so they dig and dig until they find </v>
<v Speaker 1>or invent often invent something that </v>

1357
01:17:17.090 --> 01:17:17.923
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allows a single causal attribution and </v>

1358
01:17:20.330 --> 01:17:22.580
<v Speaker 1>it's just life just isn't that simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1359
01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:23.473
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of reasons to be ill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way more reasons to be old and to be </v>

1360
01:17:26.301 --> 01:17:27.590
<v Speaker 1>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1361
01:17:29.450 --> 01:17:32.450
<v Speaker 1>what if the truth could unravel your </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire life?</v>

1362
01:17:33.230 --> 01:17:36.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well first of all it would and second,</v>

1363
01:17:36.351 --> 01:17:37.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you mean.</v>

1364
01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:38.713
<v Speaker 1>You mean what if I suppose that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cardinal case there would be that you </v>

1365
01:17:42.681 --> 01:17:43.514
<v Speaker 1>did something really terrible and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>if that was revealed it would be a </v>

1366
01:17:46.191 --> 01:17:50.930
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like without knowing the details of</v>

1367
01:17:50.931 --> 01:17:53.300
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't provide a generic answer.</v>

1368
01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:54.493
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there are some sins that </v>

1369
01:17:56.961 --> 01:17:59.930
<v Speaker 1>are so egregious that you don't get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>confess to them.</v>

1370
01:17:59.931 --> 01:18:02.030
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you've done something terrible,</v>

1371
01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:04.970
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not recommending this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just an example.</v>

1372
01:18:04.971 --> 01:18:05.804
<v Speaker 1>If you've done something terrible and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that if you revealed and it </v>

1373
01:18:08.061 --> 01:18:10.970
<v Speaker 1>would blow the lives of many people </v>
<v Speaker 1>around you apart,</v>

1374
01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:12.013
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious to me that you have any</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral justification for confessing just </v>

1375
01:18:17.511 --> 01:18:18.344
<v Speaker 1>to free your miserable soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what if the truth could unravel your </v>

1376
01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:23.264
<v Speaker 1>entire life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you need to go to Catholic </v>

1377
01:18:24.861 --> 01:18:27.320
<v Speaker 1>confession and let someone know exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened.</v>

1378
01:18:27.321 --> 01:18:28.154
<v Speaker 1>So you're clear about it then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then maybe what you need to do is to </v>

1379
01:18:29.961 --> 01:18:33.830
<v Speaker 1>swear to whatever God you worship that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to try to walk the straight</v>

1380
01:18:33.831 --> 01:18:34.664
<v Speaker 1>and narrow from here on in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that'll be sufficient to atone for </v>

1381
01:18:38.210 --> 01:18:40.910
<v Speaker 1>whatever terrible thing that you did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a,</v>

1382
01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:41.893
<v Speaker 1>that's a form of prayer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it sounds like one that you </v>

1383
01:18:44.241 --> 01:18:46.460
<v Speaker 1>desperately need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle.</v>

1384
01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:48.253
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1385
01:18:51.150 --> 01:18:53.760
<v Speaker 1>without knowing the details,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's about the best I can do.</v>

1386
01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:00.473
<v Speaker 1>I think what put you over with so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>of us was the constructive message of </v>

1387
01:19:03.691 --> 01:19:05.110
<v Speaker 1>how to be a good man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1388
01:19:05.130 --> 01:19:08.670
<v Speaker 1>a good person I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's where the media want</v>

1389
01:19:08.671 --> 01:19:10.410
<v Speaker 1>you to go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1390
01:19:10.530 --> 01:19:11.363
<v Speaker 1>Generally not day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned this earlier is that the </v>

1391
01:19:14.881 --> 01:19:15.714
<v Speaker 1>media as it disintegrates and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly is disintegrating at an </v>

1392
01:19:18.271 --> 01:19:20.670
<v Speaker 1>incredibly rapid rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1393
01:19:21.570 --> 01:19:22.403
<v Speaker 1>everything is political there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's as if the philosophical and the </v>

1394
01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:29.070
<v Speaker 1>psychological and the theological don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>

1395
01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:30.233
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly in my interviews I've been </v>

1396
01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:34.103
<v Speaker 1>talking about what's been happening at </v>
<v Speaker 1>my lectures on my tour and describing </v>

1397
01:19:37.351 --> 01:19:38.184
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the vast majority of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience isn't there for political </v>

1398
01:19:41.101 --> 01:19:41.934
<v Speaker 1>reasons at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were there because they want to </v>

1399
01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:46.560
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to have a responsible and</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful life.</v>

1400
01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:49.740
<v Speaker 1>And it's as if that story just doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>

1401
01:19:49.770 --> 01:19:50.410
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1402
01:19:50.410 --> 01:19:53.610
<v Speaker 1>the framework,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is basically a political framework</v>

1403
01:19:53.611 --> 01:19:55.710
<v Speaker 1>and increasingly a politically correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>framework,</v>

1404
01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:59.040
<v Speaker 1>doesn't allow that to exist as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

1405
01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:02.580
<v Speaker 1>And that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1406
01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:03.863
<v Speaker 1>I'm much more comfortable lecturing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the crowds that have been coming to see </v>

1407
01:20:09.031 --> 01:20:11.280
<v Speaker 1>me than I am talking to journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's become,</v>

1408
01:20:11.670 --> 01:20:13.650
<v Speaker 1>I have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have been limiting my,</v>

1409
01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:14.663
<v Speaker 1>my interactions with journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though that might not be self </v>

1410
01:20:17.221 --> 01:20:19.140
<v Speaker 1>evident yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have been trying to do that,</v>

1411
01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:20.573
<v Speaker 1>that the demands have been increasing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the proportion of media invitations </v>

1412
01:20:27.631 --> 01:20:30.090
<v Speaker 1>that I've responding to has fallen </v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatically,</v>

1413
01:20:30.091 --> 01:20:34.260
<v Speaker 1>even though the absolute number hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>declined as precipitously.</v>

1414
01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:36.660
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that while I </v>
<v Speaker 1>find the,</v>

1415
01:20:37.230 --> 01:20:40.380
<v Speaker 1>I find the typical interview very </v>
<v Speaker 1>stressful,</v>

1416
01:20:40.410 --> 01:20:41.640
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very stressful.</v>

1417
01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:42.863
<v Speaker 1>I'm on guard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say also my attitude isn't </v>

1418
01:20:45.661 --> 01:20:48.000
<v Speaker 1>as good as it could be any more because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

1419
01:20:48.990 --> 01:20:50.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm on guard so much,</v>

1420
01:20:50.761 --> 01:20:55.200
<v Speaker 1>it's easier for me to get a bit snappy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and an unpleasant and that's bad.</v>

1421
01:20:55.230 --> 01:20:56.760
<v Speaker 1>That's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do that.</v>

1422
01:20:56.790 --> 01:21:00.060
<v Speaker 1>I want to stay calm and detached and try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1423
01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:01.523
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell the truth and be happy that I'm </v>

1424
01:21:02.491 --> 01:21:06.130
<v Speaker 1>there regardless of the circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1425
01:21:06.210 --> 01:21:11.210
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the mainstream media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say is not very receptive,</v>

1426
01:21:13.710 --> 01:21:14.543
<v Speaker 1>although sometimes there's exceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not very receptive to the idea that I </v>

1427
01:21:18.721 --> 01:21:19.554
<v Speaker 1>could just be going around talking to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who want to get their life </v>

1428
01:21:21.811 --> 01:21:25.800
<v Speaker 1>together is quite saddening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's definitely a commentary</v>

1429
01:21:25.801 --> 01:21:29.790
<v Speaker 1>on the fundamental corruption of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>media apparatus.</v>

1430
01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:30.953
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1431
01:21:36.130 --> 01:21:36.963
<v Speaker 1>I think it's better to talk on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to speak on my podcast to do these </v>

1432
01:21:40.991 --> 01:21:41.824
<v Speaker 1>lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's increasingly better to </v>

1433
01:21:44.261 --> 01:21:45.094
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The long form discussions on youtube </v>

1434
01:21:47.501 --> 01:21:49.850
<v Speaker 1>though with people like Joe Rogan and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave Rubin and,</v>

1435
01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:52.510
<v Speaker 1>and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that works just fine.</v>

1436
01:21:53.050 --> 01:21:53.883
<v Speaker 1>So the new media form is emerging and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's going to be a lot more </v>

1437
01:21:58.391 --> 01:21:59.460
<v Speaker 1>productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1438
01:21:59.590 --> 01:22:02.020
<v Speaker 1>it won't be a scripted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll be much longer forum.</v>

1439
01:22:02.021 --> 01:22:04.450
<v Speaker 1>It'll be allow for much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughtfulness.</v>

1440
01:22:05.130 --> 01:22:06.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

1441
01:22:09.450 --> 01:22:10.283
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1442
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:15.410
<v Speaker 1>but it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like the media exposure,</v>

1443
01:22:15.770 --> 01:22:18.710
<v Speaker 1>although it's been stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like I'm not grateful for it.</v>

1444
01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:20.953
<v Speaker 1>Even people who've put me on the spot </v>
<v Speaker 1>very badly have ended up doing me a </v>

1445
01:22:23.811 --> 01:22:26.510
<v Speaker 1>tremendous favor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is,</v>

1446
01:22:26.511 --> 01:22:27.344
<v Speaker 1>is that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is I'm becoming too much on </v>

1447
01:22:33.651 --> 01:22:36.020
<v Speaker 1>garden and I've noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1448
01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:38.700
<v Speaker 1>developing sense of impatience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1449
01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:43.160
<v Speaker 1>within me and some suspicion and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not good.</v>

1450
01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:46.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be in situations where </v>
<v Speaker 1>those are my fundamental orientation.</v>

1451
01:22:46.910 --> 01:22:47.810
<v Speaker 1>It's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1452
01:22:48.050 --> 01:22:51.050
<v Speaker 1>it's a sign of a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>internal corruption on my part.</v>

1453
01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:52.573
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1454
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:56.900
<v Speaker 1>I want to be in situations where I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking with people,</v>

1455
01:22:57.260 --> 01:22:59.780
<v Speaker 1>speaking honestly to people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly listening.</v>

1456
01:23:00.710 --> 01:23:02.390
<v Speaker 1>That would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good situation.</v>

1457
01:23:02.690 --> 01:23:03.523
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1458
01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:10.630
<v Speaker 1>would you agree with Cs Lewis?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That if you look for truth,</v>

1459
01:23:10.631 --> 01:23:12.700
<v Speaker 1>you may find comfort?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look for comfort,</v>

1460
01:23:12.701 --> 01:23:14.320
<v Speaker 1>you will find despair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

1461
01:23:14.321 --> 01:23:17.680
<v Speaker 1>That's definitely the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite an intelligent phrase because</v>

1462
01:23:17.681 --> 01:23:18.940
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look for truth,</v>

1463
01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:23.440
<v Speaker 1>you may find comfort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't say you will find comfort.</v>

1464
01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:24.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1465
01:23:24.131 --> 01:23:26.920
<v Speaker 1>sometimes if you look for truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't find comfort to begin with.</v>

1466
01:23:26.921 --> 01:23:28.720
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You find a lot of trouble,</v>

1467
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:29.943
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes you have to go through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of trouble to get to set things </v>

1468
01:23:32.501 --> 01:23:34.540
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look for comfort,</v>

1469
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:35.830
<v Speaker 1>despair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1470
01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:39.220
<v Speaker 1>the reason for that is that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>look for comfort in life.</v>

1471
01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:44.050
<v Speaker 1>Life isn't about comfort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life is a deadly game.</v>

1472
01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:47.830
<v Speaker 1>It's a game of life and death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a game of good and evil.</v>

1473
01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:52.510
<v Speaker 1>It's everything's on the line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your sanity's on the line,</v>

1474
01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:57.360
<v Speaker 1>you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>your freedom from pain is on the line.</v>

1475
01:23:57.390 --> 01:23:59.370
<v Speaker 1>Your freedom from despair is on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>

1476
01:23:59.490 --> 01:24:02.190
<v Speaker 1>your family is on the line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no comfort.</v>

1477
01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Life is an adventure and I think the </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest adventure that you can possibly</v>

1478
01:24:06.691 --> 01:24:11.691
<v Speaker 1>have is one is the one that you find if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you look for the truth</v>

1479
01:24:15.890 --> 01:24:20.530
<v Speaker 1>and that's a good place to start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's been 90 minutes and uh,</v>

1480
01:24:22.690 --> 01:24:25.840
<v Speaker 1>I've been reasonably sharp and with it </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the full 90 minutes.</v>

1481
01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:27.693
<v Speaker 1>And so I think I'll bring it to a close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a couple of reminders for those of </v>

1482
01:24:33.581 --> 01:24:34.414
<v Speaker 1>you who tuned in late,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to try out the self </v>

1483
01:24:36.851 --> 01:24:37.684
<v Speaker 1>authoring program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made a code August and that an titles </v>

1484
01:24:41.441 --> 01:24:44.260
<v Speaker 1>you to 20% off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a two for one special so you can</v>

1485
01:24:44.261 --> 01:24:47.830
<v Speaker 1>give it to a friend as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to try to understand myself,</v>

1486
01:24:47.831 --> 01:24:51.790
<v Speaker 1>which is a personality test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it only takes about 15 minutes.</v>

1487
01:24:51.791 --> 01:24:54.220
<v Speaker 1>It's quite a bit easier than the self </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoring suite.</v>

1488
01:24:54.810 --> 01:24:57.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the code for that is also August.</v>

1489
01:24:57.130 --> 01:24:57.963
<v Speaker 1>That also gives you 20% off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Self authoring helps you write about </v>

1490
01:25:00.941 --> 01:25:04.300
<v Speaker 1>your past and present and future and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do a bad job.</v>

1491
01:25:04.301 --> 01:25:08.260
<v Speaker 1>And if you haven't developed a life plan</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't know where you are and you</v>

1492
01:25:08.261 --> 01:25:11.650
<v Speaker 1>don't know where you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I would highly recommend trying the</v>

1493
01:25:11.651 --> 01:25:12.100
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>

1494
01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:16.300
<v Speaker 1>And you're welcome to do a bad job at it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a bad plan is,</v>

1495
01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:17.433
<v Speaker 1>is a lot better than no plan at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And understand myself will help you </v>

1496
01:25:21.131 --> 01:25:23.170
<v Speaker 1>understand who you are for better or </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

1497
01:25:23.171 --> 01:25:24.004
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people have responded quite </v>

1498
01:25:25.271 --> 01:25:26.104
<v Speaker 1>positively to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's worth the 15 minutes in </v>

1499
01:25:28.811 --> 01:25:31.510
<v Speaker 1>the nine 95 that it costs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1500
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:35.260
<v Speaker 1>discounted 20% now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess that's about seven 95,</v>

1501
01:25:35.261 --> 01:25:37.450
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

1502
01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:38.493
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second Iceland lecturer is going to </v>

1503
01:25:40.751 --> 01:25:42.940
<v Speaker 1>come out soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I released the first Iceland lecture,</v>

1504
01:25:42.941 --> 01:25:43.774
<v Speaker 1>which is part of 12 rules for life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a tour coming out through the </v>

1505
01:25:46.721 --> 01:25:47.554
<v Speaker 1>northeastern part of the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting in September and then over to </v>

1506
01:25:51.491 --> 01:25:52.324
<v Speaker 1>the UK and northern Europe in September </v>
<v Speaker 1>and October and then Australia and New </v>

1507
01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:57.400
<v Speaker 1>Zealand in February.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1508
01:25:58.930 --> 01:26:02.920
<v Speaker 1>I've really enjoyed the tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an amazing opportunity.</v>

1509
01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:09.290
<v Speaker 1>It's been extraordinarily heartwarming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1510
01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:12.350
<v Speaker 1>to talk to so many people who are trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put their lives together.</v>

1511
01:26:12.351 --> 01:26:13.184
<v Speaker 1>And if enough people do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they will put their lives together </v>

1512
01:26:15.951 --> 01:26:17.840
<v Speaker 1>and that will help put everything else </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

1513
01:26:18.530 --> 01:26:19.041
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1514
01:26:19.041 --> 01:26:22.160
<v Speaker 1>hopefully these q and a's are a smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>small part of that.</v>

1515
01:26:22.910 --> 01:26:27.910
<v Speaker 1>So thank you very much for listening in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll try to do one in September.</v>

1516
01:26:28.980 --> 01:26:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I don't,</v>

1517
01:26:30.111 --> 01:26:32.210
<v Speaker 1>it's because I'm on the road all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1518
01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:34.550
<v Speaker 1>but I will definitely try to do one in </v>
<v Speaker 1>September.</v>

1519
01:26:35.150 --> 01:26:38.330
<v Speaker 1>So thank you for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to my patrion supporters.</v>

1520
01:26:38.350 --> 01:26:39.183
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned to you guys that I am </v>

1521
01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:42.073
<v Speaker 1>working hard on the online university </v>
<v Speaker 1>and have hired three people to work on </v>

1522
01:26:44.541 --> 01:26:46.610
<v Speaker 1>that and that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're about a year ahead of schedule,</v>

1523
01:26:46.611 --> 01:26:47.444
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I thought I'd be so in three </v>

1524
01:26:48.471 --> 01:26:50.420
<v Speaker 1>months were a year ahead of where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured I'd be.</v>

1525
01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:51.950
<v Speaker 1>We'd be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1526
01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:53.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
