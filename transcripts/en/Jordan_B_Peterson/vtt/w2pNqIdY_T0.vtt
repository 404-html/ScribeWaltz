1
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.840
<v Speaker 1>As I've mentioned to you before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of the three aspects of experience.</v>

2
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:40.404
<v Speaker 1>So the things you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things you don't know and the fact </v>

3
00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:48.630
<v Speaker 1>of yourself have a very ambivalent </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying structure,</v>

4
00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:49.464
<v Speaker 1>both positive and negative so that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things you don't know are interesting </v>

5
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:55.170
<v Speaker 1>and compelling and the sources of new </v>
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>

6
00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:56.004
<v Speaker 1>but also the source of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>undermine you both physically and </v>

7
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:01.560
<v Speaker 1>mentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the things that you know,</v>

8
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:02.394
<v Speaker 1>of course your culture disciplines you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and shapes you into a full person but </v>

9
00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:11.244
<v Speaker 1>also at exactly the same time molds you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and crushes you in a particular </v>

10
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:19.380
<v Speaker 1>direction rather than any of the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>directions you might have gone in.</v>

11
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.530
<v Speaker 1>And then finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with regards to the individual,</v>

12
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.260
<v Speaker 1>we spent a substantial amount of time </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussing the individual's capability,</v>

13
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.710
<v Speaker 1>capacity to make order out of chaos and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes to make chaos out of order</v>

14
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.950
<v Speaker 1>in the service of a higher order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's all to the good.</v>

15
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.400
<v Speaker 1>But just like culture and nature have </v>
<v Speaker 1>there negative aspects.</v>

16
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.263
<v Speaker 1>So did the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think personally this is where </v>

17
00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Christian mythology in particular comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>into its own.</v>

18
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:51.743
<v Speaker 1>I think of all the major religions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity has the most thoroughly </v>

19
00:01:56.461 --> 00:02:01.200
<v Speaker 1>developed what you might describe as </v>
<v Speaker 1>formal model of evil.</v>

20
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.730
<v Speaker 1>And that model isn't part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>canonical writings of Christianity,</v>

21
00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 1>say encapsulated in the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but part of the cloud of sort of natural</v>

22
00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:13.740
<v Speaker 1>mythology and storytelling that </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounds the canonical writings.</v>

23
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.903
<v Speaker 1>So you could say that although </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity and Buddhism have spent a </v>

24
00:02:19.141 --> 00:02:23.730
<v Speaker 1>substantial amount of time developing up</v>
<v Speaker 1>a representation of the hero,</v>

25
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.913
<v Speaker 1>Christianity in particular has also </v>
<v Speaker 1>spent a substantial amount of time </v>

26
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:30.743
<v Speaker 1>developing a formal portrait of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure that stands in opposition to the </v>

27
00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:35.154
<v Speaker 1>hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the most appropriate term </v>

28
00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:41.490
<v Speaker 1>for that figure who takes multiple forms</v>
<v Speaker 1>in mythology is the adversary.</v>

29
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.353
<v Speaker 1>Because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the adversarial spirit is a spirit that </v>

30
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.370
<v Speaker 1>stands in opposition to everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>stands in opposition to nature,</v>

31
00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:53.514
<v Speaker 1>stands in opposition to culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most specifically stands in </v>

32
00:02:56.701 --> 00:02:58.980
<v Speaker 1>opposition to that aspect of the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

33
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.890
<v Speaker 1>That's both exploratory and creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

34
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:03.724
<v Speaker 1>the last time we talked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a chance to describe to you how </v>

35
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:09.394
<v Speaker 1>the figures of the adversarial brothers </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerge naturally at the end of genesis </v>

36
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a Coda to this story.</v>

37
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:16.683
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam and eve developed self </v>

38
00:03:17.851 --> 00:03:18.684
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They develop knowledge of their own </v>

39
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:20.584
<v Speaker 1>mortality and death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as the primordial parents of </v>

40
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.693
<v Speaker 1>humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their first children take the form of </v>

41
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:31.060
<v Speaker 1>the hostile brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that if you're the child</v>

42
00:03:31.061 --> 00:03:35.290
<v Speaker 1>of nature and the child of culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of ultimate parents,</v>

43
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.890
<v Speaker 1>then as an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take two forms,</v>

44
00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:39.724
<v Speaker 1>a positive form in a negative form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the negative form is characterized </v>

45
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.473
<v Speaker 1>in many ways by a kind of absolute </v>
<v Speaker 1>hatred of the good hatred of the </v>

46
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:48.424
<v Speaker 1>positive form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that you can't understand </v>

47
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:53.703
<v Speaker 1>the full human propensity for evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>without considering more than the </v>

48
00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:02.930
<v Speaker 1>territory allity more than the innate </v>
<v Speaker 1>territoriality of human being.</v>

49
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.150
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

50
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:07.960
<v Speaker 1>animals are territorial and they fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>to preserve their territory,</v>

51
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.190
<v Speaker 1>and it's a rational struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fighting for resources and for a</v>

52
00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:15.400
<v Speaker 1>place that they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can operate in,</v>

53
00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:16.234
<v Speaker 1>live in and reproducing inefficiently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But human beings are substantively </v>

54
00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:23.650
<v Speaker 1>different from that in that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>agonistic conflict.</v>

55
00:04:23.651 --> 00:04:24.484
<v Speaker 1>Their aggression often seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated by something more akin to the </v>

56
00:04:28.271 --> 00:04:32.080
<v Speaker 1>pure desire for destruction rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>for any rational land whatsoever.</v>

57
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.470
<v Speaker 1>And so from that perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say as an example,</v>

58
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.383
<v Speaker 1>the fact that Hitler ended up committing</v>
<v Speaker 1>suicide in a bunker beneath Germany's </v>

59
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:47.110
<v Speaker 1>capital at the end of the Second World </v>
<v Speaker 1>War when Berlin was in flames,</v>

60
00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:50.230
<v Speaker 1>when all of Germany was in flames and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when his country was completely defeated</v>

61
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:53.020
<v Speaker 1>after tens of millions of people had </v>
<v Speaker 1>died in the conflict,</v>

62
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.153
<v Speaker 1>including of course the 7 million or so </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that were killed in the </v>

63
00:04:56.711 --> 00:04:57.544
<v Speaker 1>Holocaust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the normal mode of interpretation of </v>

64
00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:03.400
<v Speaker 1>that would be what a terrible defeat for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler,</v>

65
00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:08.401
<v Speaker 1>but an equally valid and I think an </v>
<v Speaker 1>equally valid prime of facie argument.</v>

66
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.663
<v Speaker 1>And one I think that's actually more </v>
<v Speaker 1>valid is that it wasn't a defeat for </v>

67
00:05:12.071 --> 00:05:12.904
<v Speaker 1>Hitler at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was precisely what he was aiming at </v>

68
00:05:15.251 --> 00:05:20.251
<v Speaker 1>right from the beginning because his </v>
<v Speaker 1>mode of being was intensely adversarial.</v>

69
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.933
<v Speaker 1>And I would also say that it's certainly</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible that the full nature of his </v>

70
00:05:24.881 --> 00:05:25.714
<v Speaker 1>motivations weren't even necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear to him as they unfolded across </v>

71
00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:33.970
<v Speaker 1>time during the Second World War.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No more than the full motivations of any</v>

72
00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:37.690
<v Speaker 1>human being are necessarily accessible </v>
<v Speaker 1>to them as they act out,</v>

73
00:05:37.691 --> 00:05:40.090
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is that they act out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Carl Young says,</v>

74
00:05:40.091 --> 00:05:40.980
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we,</v>

75
00:05:40.981 --> 00:05:41.814
<v Speaker 1>we act out great mythological stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't necessarily mean you know </v>

76
00:05:46.421 --> 00:05:48.220
<v Speaker 1>the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just means you act it out.</v>

77
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:49.503
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see people whose lives are </v>

78
00:05:51.071 --> 00:05:55.870
<v Speaker 1>repetitive bouts of tragedy and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're acting out is a tragic story,</v>

79
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.360
<v Speaker 1>and they know it in so far as they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually acting it out,</v>

80
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:00.194
<v Speaker 1>but they don't necessarily have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>explicit model of the relationship </v>

81
00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:04.394
<v Speaker 1>between their patterns of behavior in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the constantly tragic outcomes they </v>

82
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:07.970
<v Speaker 1>produce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

83
00:06:07.971 --> 00:06:08.804
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't even necessarily mean that </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing isn't voluntary </v>

84
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.480
<v Speaker 1>because things can be voluntary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you don't understand them fully.</v>

85
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.430
<v Speaker 1>There's an aspect to the human psyche </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a nest of vipers,</v>

86
00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:22.910
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can't necessarily trust what</v>

87
00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:23.744
<v Speaker 1>you see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means not only when you're </v>

88
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:25.484
<v Speaker 1>looking at someone else say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even when you're looking in the </v>

89
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:27.614
<v Speaker 1>mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't be sure that what you say </v>

90
00:06:28.881 --> 00:06:30.920
<v Speaker 1>you're doing is exactly what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

91
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.370
<v Speaker 1>Your motivations aren't transparent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they may not even be clear.</v>

92
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:40.283
<v Speaker 1>So I suppose the idea that lurks behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>this formalization is that freedom of </v>

93
00:06:44.641 --> 00:06:49.641
<v Speaker 1>choice is such a good that one of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>subsidiary necessities,</v>

94
00:06:50.251 --> 00:06:51.084
<v Speaker 1>which is that there has to be a polar </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction between good and evil is </v>

95
00:06:55.021 --> 00:06:55.854
<v Speaker 1>worth having.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freedom is so important that it </v>

96
00:06:57.661 --> 00:07:00.150
<v Speaker 1>justifies the distinction between good </v>
<v Speaker 1>and evil.</v>

97
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.553
<v Speaker 1>And I think that our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a reasonable way to </v>

98
00:07:03.781 --> 00:07:04.614
<v Speaker 1>presume</v>

99
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:08.813
<v Speaker 1>it's reasonable to presume that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the manner in which experience is </v>

100
00:07:11.161 --> 00:07:13.950
<v Speaker 1>actually structured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's complex reasons for that.</v>

101
00:07:13.951 --> 00:07:17.700
<v Speaker 1>One would be that under the most optimal</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances,</v>

102
00:07:17.701 --> 00:07:21.030
<v Speaker 1>which is something we'll talk about as </v>
<v Speaker 1>this proceeds to a close,</v>

103
00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.820
<v Speaker 1>that means in a sense you can have your </v>
<v Speaker 1>cake and eat it too,</v>

104
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:25.043
<v Speaker 1>which means the potential existence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>good and evil allows for freedom of </v>

105
00:07:28.591 --> 00:07:31.380
<v Speaker 1>choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if the choice is always towards</v>

106
00:07:31.381 --> 00:07:34.260
<v Speaker 1>the good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have the benefits of freedom of</v>

107
00:07:34.261 --> 00:07:35.094
<v Speaker 1>choice plus the benefits of the good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only price you have to pay is the </v>

108
00:07:37.801 --> 00:07:38.634
<v Speaker 1>constant possibility of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very much like the structure of </v>

109
00:07:41.131 --> 00:07:41.964
<v Speaker 1>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have the highest God whose whose </v>

110
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:47.063
<v Speaker 1>highest son is Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have the figure of the Satan </v>

111
00:07:49.651 --> 00:07:50.484
<v Speaker 1>lurking in the background who's also got</v>
<v Speaker 1>a filial relationship with the highest </v>

112
00:07:53.161 --> 00:07:53.994
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes for a confusing kind of </v>

113
00:07:55.801 --> 00:07:58.410
<v Speaker 1>theology because in many situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

114
00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:02.340
<v Speaker 1>Christ is identified specifically with </v>
<v Speaker 1>God the father,</v>

115
00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.920
<v Speaker 1>but Satan always lurks in the background</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his,</v>

116
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:09.780
<v Speaker 1>his existential status is indeterminate </v>
<v Speaker 1>because since God is everything,</v>

117
00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:10.614
<v Speaker 1>then it's very difficult to make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case that the evil spirit isn't a </v>

118
00:08:13.021 --> 00:08:14.100
<v Speaker 1>derivative of God.</v>

119
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.070
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy thing to get straightened </v>
<v Speaker 1>out rationally.</v>

120
00:08:17.071 --> 00:08:20.670
<v Speaker 1>And I think Milton in paradise lost does</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very good attempt,</v>

121
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.080
<v Speaker 1>makes a very good attempt to explain </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what this might mean,</v>

122
00:08:25.081 --> 00:08:27.690
<v Speaker 1>how there could be an overarching </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent power.</v>

123
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.270
<v Speaker 1>And there could be two subordinate </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements to that.</v>

124
00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:31.283
<v Speaker 1>One evil in one good without destroying </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that God as such as good and </v>

125
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:40.170
<v Speaker 1>without eradicating the reality of evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

126
00:08:40.171 --> 00:08:45.171
<v Speaker 1>very complex argument to make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the notion of evil is also very,</v>

127
00:08:45.541 --> 00:08:48.750
<v Speaker 1>very complex idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at our arguments that,</v>

128
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>support atheism,</v>

129
00:08:50.551 --> 00:08:51.384
<v Speaker 1>and I've mentioned some of these like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ivan's argument in the brothers </v>

130
00:08:53.341 --> 00:08:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Karamazov where Ivan says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

131
00:08:55.301 --> 00:08:56.134
<v Speaker 1>the world and as such experiences such </v>
<v Speaker 1>must be evil because it's predicated on </v>

132
00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:02.850
<v Speaker 1>the blood of innocence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the suffering of children.</v>

133
00:09:02.851 --> 00:09:03.684
<v Speaker 1>The fact that there's vast injustices in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is indicative that there's no </v>

134
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:07.584
<v Speaker 1>such thing as a good God or to speak and</v>
<v Speaker 1>less personified terms is evidence that </v>

135
00:09:11.971 --> 00:09:15.630
<v Speaker 1>the structure of experience as such is </v>
<v Speaker 1>an untenable morally.</v>

136
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.900
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be because it's predicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>on suffering.</v>

137
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:23.100
<v Speaker 1>Jeffrey Burton Russell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's written a whole series of books on</v>

138
00:09:23.101 --> 00:09:23.934
<v Speaker 1>the nature of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes a very clear distinction </v>

139
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:29.370
<v Speaker 1>between different categories of terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>events that I hit.</v>

140
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.340
<v Speaker 1>I think help bring this into clarity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so imagine this,</v>

141
00:09:32.341 --> 00:09:36.570
<v Speaker 1>imagine first that it's useful to make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction between tragedy and evil.</v>

142
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:37.531
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

143
00:09:37.531 --> 00:09:42.450
<v Speaker 1>tragedy is when the bad befalls the good</v>
<v Speaker 1>and earthquake is tragic,</v>

144
00:09:42.451 --> 00:09:43.284
<v Speaker 1>so or diseases tragic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's easy to regard a disease or an </v>

145
00:09:46.171 --> 00:09:47.004
<v Speaker 1>earthquake as evil as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem with that is that </v>

146
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:51.630
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem to be any motivation to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's more likely,</v>

147
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.430
<v Speaker 1>it's more reasonable to think something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

148
00:09:53.431 --> 00:09:55.380
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are vulnerable.</v>

149
00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.330
<v Speaker 1>They have to be vulnerable in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>give existence a viewpoint.</v>

150
00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:01.164
<v Speaker 1>One of the consequences of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability is that they're </v>

151
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.000
<v Speaker 1>susceptible to tragedy.</v>

152
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:07.833
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

153
00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.590
<v Speaker 1>If their vulnerability is a precondition</v>
<v Speaker 1>for being,</v>

154
00:10:11.591 --> 00:10:14.770
<v Speaker 1>then the fact that they're susceptible </v>
<v Speaker 1>to tragedy isn't necessarily an evil.</v>

155
00:10:14.771 --> 00:10:17.560
<v Speaker 1>It's just a consequence of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>limitation.</v>

156
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:20.421
<v Speaker 1>Then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

157
00:10:20.421 --> 00:10:21.254
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes evil if you can't put </v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquakes and diseases and so forth </v>

158
00:10:24.081 --> 00:10:25.640
<v Speaker 1>into that category?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

159
00:10:25.641 --> 00:10:28.910
<v Speaker 1>there didn't seem to be something more </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent on choice,</v>

160
00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:31.070
<v Speaker 1>which is the argument that Elliot is </v>
<v Speaker 1>making.</v>

161
00:10:31.071 --> 00:10:31.904
<v Speaker 1>Say</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rural does all sorts of terrible </v>

162
00:10:34.521 --> 00:10:36.230
<v Speaker 1>things to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are frequent,</v>

163
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.823
<v Speaker 1>it's frequently the case that people act</v>
<v Speaker 1>in such a way to make things worse </v>

164
00:10:41.471 --> 00:10:42.790
<v Speaker 1>rather than better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

165
00:10:42.791 --> 00:10:47.791
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rise to power of the Nazis,</v>

166
00:10:48.311 --> 00:10:49.144
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem reasonable to put the </v>

167
00:10:50.231 --> 00:10:51.064
<v Speaker 1>Nazi concentration camp in the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>category from an ethical perspective as </v>

168
00:10:54.581 --> 00:10:56.680
<v Speaker 1>the earthquake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

169
00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:57.873
<v Speaker 1>Because the earthquake is an emergent </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the rules that govern </v>

170
00:11:02.861 --> 00:11:06.130
<v Speaker 1>physical existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the Nazi death camp is something</v>

171
00:11:06.131 --> 00:11:08.770
<v Speaker 1>that was planned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't have to be.</v>

172
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:09.633
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be an aspect of choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this seems to be the idea that's </v>

173
00:11:13.841 --> 00:11:17.290
<v Speaker 1>lurking underneath both this mythology </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Eliade addys comment on it.</v>

174
00:11:17.291 --> 00:11:18.124
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

175
00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.530
<v Speaker 1>the mere fact that the world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>

176
00:11:20.531 --> 00:11:21.364
<v Speaker 1>does not mean that it's evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then when you look at specifically </v>

177
00:11:23.501 --> 00:11:24.334
<v Speaker 1>human actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this aspect of twisted choice </v>

178
00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:28.060
<v Speaker 1>that fry also makes much of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

179
00:11:28.061 --> 00:11:28.894
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the structure of human </v>

180
00:11:29.801 --> 00:11:34.801
<v Speaker 1>history and you try to explain why it </v>
<v Speaker 1>has such a bloody and terrible course,</v>

181
00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:36.903
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem sufficient just to </v>
<v Speaker 1>attribute it say to the conditions of </v>

182
00:11:40.241 --> 00:11:43.060
<v Speaker 1>existence or to ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems more like there's,</v>

183
00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a force behind it,</v>

184
00:11:45.671 --> 00:11:46.900
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest,</v>

185
00:11:46.901 --> 00:11:47.734
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and every individual that's actually </v>

186
00:11:48.881 --> 00:11:49.714
<v Speaker 1>aiming at the suffering instead of just </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing it to happen or instead of not </v>

187
00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:56.020
<v Speaker 1>stepping in to stop it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually aiming at it.</v>

188
00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:00.563
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

189
00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.780
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's take a look at the story.</v>

190
00:12:02.781 --> 00:12:03.810
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

191
00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.810
<v Speaker 1>and let's take a look at the leading </v>
<v Speaker 1>figures.</v>

192
00:12:05.811 --> 00:12:06.890
<v Speaker 1>So we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

193
00:12:06.891 --> 00:12:10.520
<v Speaker 1>that the figure of Satan and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity is associated with a number</v>

194
00:12:10.521 --> 00:12:11.960
<v Speaker 1>of strange forms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

195
00:12:11.961 --> 00:12:16.280
<v Speaker 1>The first association we know of is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's associated with the,</v>

196
00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.120
<v Speaker 1>with the dragon and in the garden of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Eden,</v>

197
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:21.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

198
00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:22.673
<v Speaker 1>and so that there's a profound </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambivalence and Christianity about the </v>

199
00:12:24.621 --> 00:12:28.070
<v Speaker 1>meaning of the opening act of genesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because on the one hand you have,</v>

200
00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.680
<v Speaker 1>when Adam and eve are still profoundly </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious,</v>

201
00:12:30.681 --> 00:12:34.610
<v Speaker 1>they don't suffer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're profoundly unconscious,</v>

202
00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:35.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not self conscious,</v>

203
00:12:35.841 --> 00:12:38.600
<v Speaker 1>they're not aware of themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in many ways there's still animals.</v>

204
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.840
<v Speaker 1>So there's a gnostic line of </v>
<v Speaker 1>speculation.</v>

205
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:42.763
<v Speaker 1>The gnostics were a Christian sect that </v>
<v Speaker 1>believed that a redemption could at </v>

206
00:12:46.911 --> 00:12:50.660
<v Speaker 1>least partly be attained by </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding rather than just faith.</v>

207
00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:51.673
<v Speaker 1>The gnostics believed that the the </v>
<v Speaker 1>serpent tempted Adam and eve towards </v>

208
00:12:55.391 --> 00:12:56.224
<v Speaker 1>self consciousness was a more developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect of God then the God that had </v>

209
00:13:00.591 --> 00:13:01.424
<v Speaker 1>created Adam and eve to begin with </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the unconsciousness that </v>

210
00:13:03.591 --> 00:13:07.580
<v Speaker 1>characterized Adam and eve was to </v>
<v Speaker 1>underdeveloped to be perfect.</v>

211
00:13:07.581 --> 00:13:08.414
<v Speaker 1>And so they had to be tempted forward </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a more fully developed </v>

212
00:13:11.121 --> 00:13:11.954
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so although classical Christianity </v>

213
00:13:13.791 --> 00:13:16.790
<v Speaker 1>associated the serpent in the tree with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucifer,</v>

214
00:13:16.791 --> 00:13:18.530
<v Speaker 1>who's the bringer of light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who Satan,</v>

215
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:21.950
<v Speaker 1>the gnostic thread of reasoning said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

216
00:13:21.951 --> 00:13:23.930
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that simple because yeah,</v>

217
00:13:23.931 --> 00:13:24.764
<v Speaker 1>self consciousness makes you aware of </v>
<v Speaker 1>death and vulnerability and and knocks </v>

218
00:13:28.101 --> 00:13:30.800
<v Speaker 1>you out into the profane world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's an aspect of it,</v>

219
00:13:30.801 --> 00:13:31.634
<v Speaker 1>the kind of looks like enlightenment and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know this already in your own lives </v>

220
00:13:34.401 --> 00:13:35.234
<v Speaker 1>because often when you believe something</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're unconsciously convinced of </v>

221
00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:42.680
<v Speaker 1>the adequacy of that model and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>find that it's not sufficient,</v>

222
00:13:42.681 --> 00:13:43.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

223
00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:44.023
<v Speaker 1>And so you crumble in in disappointment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put your trust in someone and you </v>

224
00:13:46.911 --> 00:13:49.400
<v Speaker 1>find out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say they're not worthy of that trust.</v>

225
00:13:49.401 --> 00:13:50.234
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the evidence that enlightens you </v>

226
00:13:53.271 --> 00:13:56.060
<v Speaker 1>breaks that frame of reference and makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>you collapse.</v>

227
00:13:56.061 --> 00:13:56.894
<v Speaker 1>You think that's a terrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't help but feel that as a real </v>

228
00:14:00.021 --> 00:14:03.380
<v Speaker 1>betrayal and as an act even of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then a year later,</v>

229
00:14:03.381 --> 00:14:05.060
<v Speaker 1>two years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might look back and think,</v>

230
00:14:05.061 --> 00:14:05.870
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

231
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:09.440
<v Speaker 1>I really needed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really needed that lesson because as a</v>

232
00:14:09.441 --> 00:14:10.274
<v Speaker 1>consequence of learning that I'm much </v>
<v Speaker 1>more mature and much more likely to </v>

233
00:14:13.281 --> 00:14:14.114
<v Speaker 1>establish stable relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's easy to see that from one </v>

234
00:14:17.841 --> 00:14:20.800
<v Speaker 1>perspective something can be terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then from another,</v>

235
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:24.170
<v Speaker 1>it might not be terrible at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even in classic Christianity,</v>

236
00:14:24.171 --> 00:14:25.004
<v Speaker 1>you get this strange ambivalence about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the events in genesis that runs </v>

237
00:14:27.921 --> 00:14:29.030
<v Speaker 1>something like this.</v>

238
00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:30.531
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

239
00:14:30.531 --> 00:14:33.830
<v Speaker 1>it was an act of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the most evil spirit,</v>

240
00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:36.470
<v Speaker 1>the spirit of enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spirit of rationality,</v>

241
00:14:36.471 --> 00:14:37.304
<v Speaker 1>or the bringer of light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucifer to knock Adam and eve out of </v>

242
00:14:39.861 --> 00:14:43.520
<v Speaker 1>their transcendental unconsciousness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to start history,</v>

243
00:14:43.521 --> 00:14:46.610
<v Speaker 1>it was an evil act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand,</v>

244
00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:50.690
<v Speaker 1>it was also the precondition for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>later emergence of Christ.</v>

245
00:14:50.691 --> 00:14:52.370
<v Speaker 1>And as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the Christians are concerned,</v>

246
00:14:52.371 --> 00:14:56.510
<v Speaker 1>that's the greatest event in history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So without this initial opening act,</v>

247
00:14:56.511 --> 00:14:57.980
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this tragic opening act,</v>

248
00:14:58.190 --> 00:14:59.023
<v Speaker 1>there'd be no reason for the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>redemptive story and therefore </v>

249
00:15:02.241 --> 00:15:05.270
<v Speaker 1>considered from the perspective of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>total story.</v>

250
00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:09.830
<v Speaker 1>The opening tragedy cannot purely be </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered evil.</v>

251
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complicated line of reasoning.</v>

252
00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.193
<v Speaker 1>Now the other thing you see here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think this relates back to our </v>

253
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:20.060
<v Speaker 1>initial map,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

254
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:22.970
<v Speaker 1>and this also helps you understand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way people think.</v>

255
00:15:22.971 --> 00:15:23.804
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said already that it's real easy to </v>

256
00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.700
<v Speaker 1>confuse tragedy and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

257
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:29.563
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is that it's real </v>

258
00:15:30.861 --> 00:15:33.680
<v Speaker 1>easy to confuse the negative aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the unknown.</v>

259
00:15:33.681 --> 00:15:35.150
<v Speaker 1>With evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And likewise,</v>

260
00:15:35.151 --> 00:15:38.360
<v Speaker 1>it's very easy to confuse the negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect of culture with evil,</v>

261
00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:41.180
<v Speaker 1>your own culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tear radical aspect of it,</v>

262
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.390
<v Speaker 1>or the culture of other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very easy for,</v>

263
00:15:44.391 --> 00:15:46.820
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for us to demonize the foreigner.</v>

264
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:47.833
<v Speaker 1>And that's basically because there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of our mind that presumes that all </v>

265
00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:55.450
<v Speaker 1>things that strike us negatively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all things that produce negative emotion</v>

266
00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.670
<v Speaker 1>on our part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fear are the same thing.</v>

267
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:04.030
<v Speaker 1>So there's a blurry category of evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all terrible natural things,</v>

268
00:16:04.371 --> 00:16:05.204
<v Speaker 1>all terrible social things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then whatever nastiness the </v>

269
00:16:07.971 --> 00:16:10.880
<v Speaker 1>individual can generate among </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

270
00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:12.973
<v Speaker 1>it's much more useful to draw a clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction between these different </v>

271
00:16:17.061 --> 00:16:21.770
<v Speaker 1>categories because that clarity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought can help you,</v>

272
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:23.443
<v Speaker 1>can help you focus in most specifically </v>
<v Speaker 1>on those things that the individual is </v>

273
00:16:27.231 --> 00:16:30.860
<v Speaker 1>responsible for in terms of turning the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world to waste.</v>

274
00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:35.660
<v Speaker 1>So Milton says this figure of Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucifer,</v>

275
00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:37.190
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the light bringer,</v>

276
00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:38.113
<v Speaker 1>always associated with rationality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milton presents him as a remarkable </v>

277
00:16:41.331 --> 00:16:42.051
<v Speaker 1>creature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

278
00:16:42.051 --> 00:16:45.740
<v Speaker 1>He's the head highest angel in God's </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavenly hierarchy.</v>

279
00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.840
<v Speaker 1>He is Christ elder brother in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

280
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:49.003
<v Speaker 1>in a similar mythological vein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the most powerful angel that ever </v>

281
00:16:52.371 --> 00:16:53.204
<v Speaker 1>lived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at least in the opening stages of </v>

282
00:16:54.951 --> 00:16:55.784
<v Speaker 1>this act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Satan is presented as something </v>

283
00:16:57.351 --> 00:16:59.390
<v Speaker 1>absolutely remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

284
00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:00.283
<v Speaker 1>the problem is here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his very remarkable Nis starts to work </v>

285
00:17:03.321 --> 00:17:04.154
<v Speaker 1>against him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is that as he grows in </v>

286
00:17:07.401 --> 00:17:08.234
<v Speaker 1>power and strength in this heavenly </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy starts to become convinced </v>

287
00:17:11.601 --> 00:17:16.601
<v Speaker 1>that the omniscient himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that transcendent figure is,</v>

288
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:19.063
<v Speaker 1>is unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is that whatever Satan </v>

289
00:17:22.011 --> 00:17:26.630
<v Speaker 1>represents decides because of his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>pride,</v>

290
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:27.703
<v Speaker 1>his own belief in his own sufficiency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the transcendent can be eradicated </v>

291
00:17:32.841 --> 00:17:35.120
<v Speaker 1>from consideration the way Milton </v>
<v Speaker 1>presents.</v>

292
00:17:35.121 --> 00:17:38.420
<v Speaker 1>That is as a revolution in heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>

293
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:42.620
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that the story is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

294
00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Kelley,</v>

295
00:17:45.351 --> 00:17:46.184
<v Speaker 1>way back in like 1955 noted that what </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings like more than anything </v>

296
00:17:50.401 --> 00:17:51.234
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really when you get right down to it is </v>

297
00:17:52.711 --> 00:17:55.020
<v Speaker 1>to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

298
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a pain to be wrong,</v>

299
00:17:57.391 --> 00:17:58.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're wrong,</v>

300
00:17:58.861 --> 00:17:59.694
<v Speaker 1>then the little structure that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>using to conjure up the world has to </v>

301
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.493
<v Speaker 1>dissolve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to do a lot of really </v>

302
00:18:06.481 --> 00:18:09.210
<v Speaker 1>aggravating work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploratory work and creative work.</v>

303
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.150
<v Speaker 1>To put it back together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And during the time,</v>

304
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:13.103
<v Speaker 1>before you put it back together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're flooded with negative </v>

305
00:18:15.631 --> 00:18:16.920
<v Speaker 1>motivational states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

306
00:18:16.921 --> 00:18:19.890
<v Speaker 1>You don't know which way is up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphorically speaking.</v>

307
00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:23.100
<v Speaker 1>So we don't like to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't like not to be,</v>

308
00:18:23.101 --> 00:18:23.730
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

309
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:25.200
<v Speaker 1>and so what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

310
00:18:25.201 --> 00:18:29.010
<v Speaker 1>psychologists know that people have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very strong confirmatory bias,</v>

311
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:29.993
<v Speaker 1>which basically means that if you bring </v>
<v Speaker 1>a frame of reference to bear on the </v>

312
00:18:32.431 --> 00:18:35.010
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability is very high,</v>

313
00:18:35.011 --> 00:18:35.844
<v Speaker 1>that you will look for confirming </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence and you will discount </v>

314
00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:40.973
<v Speaker 1>disconfirming evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the other thing that is </v>

315
00:18:43.651 --> 00:18:47.610
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of great figures of evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Satan is their tendency to lie,</v>

316
00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:49.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Satan is prince of the lie.</v>

317
00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.000
<v Speaker 1>Now what does that mean exactly?</v>

318
00:18:56.060 --> 00:19:01.060
<v Speaker 1>So Tsl Eliot wrote this poem called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cocktail hour.</v>

319
00:19:01.421 --> 00:19:03.690
<v Speaker 1>He talks about this woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes in for psychiatric treatment.</v>

320
00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:06.130
<v Speaker 1>The woman says to the psychiatrist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling Ya,</v>

321
00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:08.590
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really hope there's something wrong with</v>

322
00:19:08.591 --> 00:19:11.050
<v Speaker 1>me because I'm having a miserable time </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

323
00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.840
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only two options here.</v>

324
00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:14.883
<v Speaker 1>Either I'm okay and I'm having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>miserable time because the world is </v>

325
00:19:17.381 --> 00:19:18.214
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which case there's nothing I can do </v>

326
00:19:20.501 --> 00:19:21.334
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or there's something wrong with me at </v>

327
00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:23.973
<v Speaker 1>some level of analysis that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really comprehend and although that's a </v>

328
00:19:27.401 --> 00:19:28.234
<v Speaker 1>painful option,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really hoping it's true because if </v>

329
00:19:30.701 --> 00:19:33.100
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly I can fix it.</v>

330
00:19:33.101 --> 00:19:35.350
<v Speaker 1>And if there's something wrong with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of the world,</v>

331
00:19:35.351 --> 00:19:37.900
<v Speaker 1>well what's there to do about that?</v>

332
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:41.993
<v Speaker 1>Often what you see in psychotherapy is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>battle between those two perspectives </v>

333
00:19:44.611 --> 00:19:45.444
<v Speaker 1>going on in the minds of the client that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the client is in a situation where </v>

334
00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:54.320
<v Speaker 1>they're repetitively facing tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a specific viewpoint about the</v>

335
00:19:54.961 --> 00:19:56.190
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like their viewpoint might be,</v>

336
00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes right down to it,</v>

337
00:19:57.961 --> 00:19:58.794
<v Speaker 1>you really can't trust other people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have all sorts of reasons for </v>

338
00:20:01.081 --> 00:20:01.914
<v Speaker 1>believing that maybe they were abused as</v>
<v Speaker 1>children or they've had a bad </v>

339
00:20:03.721 --> 00:20:04.554
<v Speaker 1>developmental history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a number of relationships that haven't </v>

340
00:20:06.361 --> 00:20:07.194
<v Speaker 1>gone well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have all the facts at their </v>

341
00:20:08.791 --> 00:20:11.160
<v Speaker 1>disposal to justify that particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

342
00:20:11.161 --> 00:20:11.994
<v Speaker 1>But the truth of the matter is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that as long as they hold on to that </v>

343
00:20:14.431 --> 00:20:17.880
<v Speaker 1>belief and won't let it go and no wonder</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't,</v>

344
00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.313
<v Speaker 1>they're going to continue to suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of what you're always doing to </v>

345
00:20:21.511 --> 00:20:22.740
<v Speaker 1>someone in therapy saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

346
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:23.783
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to a pretty coherent view of the </v>

347
00:20:24.871 --> 00:20:25.704
<v Speaker 1>world and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can understand why you'd like to </v>

348
00:20:27.781 --> 00:20:30.720
<v Speaker 1>cram the whole world into that coherent </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

349
00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:31.733
<v Speaker 1>But the truth of the matter is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as you hold onto that and won't </v>

350
00:20:33.601 --> 00:20:34.770
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

351
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:37.410
<v Speaker 1>we'll go through this terrible period of</v>
<v Speaker 1>disillusion.</v>

352
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:41.970
<v Speaker 1>It's always going to produce the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>tragic consequences.</v>

353
00:20:41.971 --> 00:20:44.400
<v Speaker 1>So as long as you hold onto your belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>rigidly,</v>

354
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:47.350
<v Speaker 1>everything around you is going to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>from bad to works.</v>

355
00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.550
<v Speaker 1>Fry says with regards to state's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

356
00:20:51.551 --> 00:20:52.384
<v Speaker 1>a demonic fall as Milton presents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It involves defining southern rivalry </v>

357
00:20:56.351 --> 00:20:58.930
<v Speaker 1>with god rather than simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>disobedience.</v>

358
00:20:59.140 --> 00:20:59.973
<v Speaker 1>And hence the demonic society is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sustained and systematic parody of the </v>

359
00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:03.694
<v Speaker 1>divine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One associated with devils are fallen </v>

360
00:21:05.531 --> 00:21:07.510
<v Speaker 1>angels because it seems far beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal,</v>

361
00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:08.373
<v Speaker 1>normal human capacity in its powers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We read avast ending and descending </v>

362
00:21:12.881 --> 00:21:13.714
<v Speaker 1>angels on Jacobs and play those ladders </v>
<v Speaker 1>and and similar that there seem to be </v>

363
00:21:16.721 --> 00:21:17.554
<v Speaker 1>demonic reinforcements in heathen life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That account for the almost superhuman </v>

364
00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:26.130
<v Speaker 1>grandier of heathen empires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially just before they fall too.</v>

365
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.153
<v Speaker 1>Particular notable passages in the old </v>
<v Speaker 1>testament prophets linked to this theme </v>

366
00:21:29.961 --> 00:21:30.794
<v Speaker 1>are the denunciation of Babylon in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Isaiah 14 and attire and is equal 28 </v>

367
00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:40.300
<v Speaker 1>Babylon is associated with Lucifer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The morning star who said to himself,</v>

368
00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.790
<v Speaker 1>I will be like the most high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

369
00:21:42.791 --> 00:21:46.300
<v Speaker 1>so let's translate that into modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>language and forget about Babylon.</v>

370
00:21:46.301 --> 00:21:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Let's take the Soviet Union for example </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead,</v>

371
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:53.620
<v Speaker 1>and let's say something like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will be like the most high.</v>

372
00:21:53.621 --> 00:21:54.221
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

373
00:21:54.221 --> 00:21:57.820
<v Speaker 1>it's not difficult to read Stellan into </v>
<v Speaker 1>that from a personal perspective,</v>

374
00:21:57.821 --> 00:22:01.780
<v Speaker 1>but then it's more complicated than that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can't blame the Soviet Union</v>

375
00:22:01.781 --> 00:22:02.614
<v Speaker 1>on Stallon when the wall fell down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that one third of east Germans </v>

376
00:22:06.221 --> 00:22:09.130
<v Speaker 1>were KGB informers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't blame that on Stellan.</v>

377
00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:10.173
<v Speaker 1>You have to blame that on the one third </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the East Germans who were KGB </v>

378
00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:14.430
<v Speaker 1>informers right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this,</v>

379
00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:15.383
<v Speaker 1>this totalitarian presupposition </v>
<v Speaker 1>presumption is distributed through the </v>

380
00:22:18.461 --> 00:22:21.340
<v Speaker 1>whole society and there's a leader in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and all that,</v>

381
00:22:21.341 --> 00:22:22.174
<v Speaker 1>but they're not the people to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>identified with the fact of the </v>

382
00:22:25.871 --> 00:22:26.704
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's distributed through the whole </v>

383
00:22:28.301 --> 00:22:32.860
<v Speaker 1>society and it's precisely this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what I don't know.</v>

384
00:22:32.861 --> 00:22:34.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need what?</v>

385
00:22:34.991 --> 00:22:35.824
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

386
00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:44.340
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I really liked about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of Christian metaphysical take</v>

387
00:22:44.341 --> 00:22:45.174
<v Speaker 1>on the problem of evil is that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it adopts strange first principles like </v>

388
00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:52.620
<v Speaker 1>if you're an a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're an empirical scientist,</v>

389
00:22:52.621 --> 00:22:55.530
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to come to terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the notion of free choice,</v>

390
00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:56.693
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we don't have deterministic </v>

391
00:22:57.271 --> 00:22:58.380
<v Speaker 1>models of free choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't,</v>

392
00:22:58.381 --> 00:22:59.214
<v Speaker 1>we don't know how that might occur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although it seems to be a reasonable </v>

393
00:23:02.011 --> 00:23:06.090
<v Speaker 1>phenomenological observation that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's anything true about existence,</v>

394
00:23:06.091 --> 00:23:09.510
<v Speaker 1>about the facts of existence as it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjectively construed,</v>

395
00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.553
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you seem to have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>faculty of choice seems paramount or </v>

396
00:23:13.441 --> 00:23:15.690
<v Speaker 1>primary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now one might say,</v>

397
00:23:15.691 --> 00:23:16.524
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just a delusion and we know that </v>

398
00:23:17.611 --> 00:23:21.450
<v Speaker 1>because our deterministic models have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been so powerful.</v>

399
00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.100
<v Speaker 1>Or One might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

400
00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:23.963
<v Speaker 1>alternatively we're going to presume the</v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective experience to be true and </v>

401
00:23:27.091 --> 00:23:27.481
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

402
00:23:27.481 --> 00:23:29.860
<v Speaker 1>are deterministic models just aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated enough?</v>

403
00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:30.693
<v Speaker 1>And there's no real reason to choose </v>
<v Speaker 1>between either of those on a priori </v>

404
00:23:33.211 --> 00:23:35.700
<v Speaker 1>basis right there perhaps equally </v>
<v Speaker 1>plausible.</v>

405
00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:39.240
<v Speaker 1>And we also might note from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>deterministic perspective of course,</v>

406
00:23:39.241 --> 00:23:40.074
<v Speaker 1>that if you go down far enough in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis of physical structures down to </v>

407
00:23:43.981 --> 00:23:46.850
<v Speaker 1>the quantum level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say then deterministic models don't hold</v>

408
00:23:46.851 --> 00:23:47.684
<v Speaker 1>it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So determinism has its limits at the </v>

409
00:23:49.401 --> 00:23:52.130
<v Speaker 1>lower end or high resolution into </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical inquiry.</v>

410
00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.620
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea what that might mean for </v>
<v Speaker 1>free choice.</v>

411
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:55.843
<v Speaker 1>It just means that there are levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis that deterministic models do </v>

412
00:23:58.701 --> 00:23:59.534
<v Speaker 1>not describe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity takes the stance that the </v>

413
00:24:04.311 --> 00:24:05.144
<v Speaker 1>subjective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the subjective sense of freedom is </v>

414
00:24:09.471 --> 00:24:12.950
<v Speaker 1>accurate and then tries to build the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world from that point.</v>

415
00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:14.503
<v Speaker 1>It presumes that see an axiomatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>principle and so you have God in </v>

416
00:24:17.541 --> 00:24:20.630
<v Speaker 1>Milton's paradise lost saying with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards both to Lucifer,</v>

417
00:24:20.631 --> 00:24:23.300
<v Speaker 1>n two human beings who are fallen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

418
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:25.430
<v Speaker 1>so will fall.</v>

419
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:29.870
<v Speaker 1>He and his faithless progeny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking of human beings whose fault,</v>

420
00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.950
<v Speaker 1>whose but his own engrade he had of me </v>
<v Speaker 1>all he could have.</v>

421
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:35.630
<v Speaker 1>I made him justin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

422
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:39.080
<v Speaker 1>sufficient to have stood though free to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall.</v>

423
00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:40.813
<v Speaker 1>And I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that makes a fair bit of sense </v>

424
00:24:42.291 --> 00:24:43.124
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started to understand this most </v>

425
00:24:45.141 --> 00:24:45.974
<v Speaker 1>particularly as a consequence of reading</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl Young because you has this really </v>

426
00:24:48.561 --> 00:24:49.394
<v Speaker 1>interesting notion and I think it's tied</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the idea in genesis that as soon as </v>

427
00:24:53.331 --> 00:24:55.910
<v Speaker 1>adam become self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hides from God.</v>

428
00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:57.103
<v Speaker 1>So what if it was this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we can take an evolutionary tack on </v>

429
00:24:59.301 --> 00:25:01.040
<v Speaker 1>this too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if it was this?</v>

430
00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.903
<v Speaker 1>What if it was the case that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>never turned away from any phenomenal </v>

431
00:25:06.891 --> 00:25:07.724
<v Speaker 1>logical evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you build a personality that would </v>

432
00:25:10.401 --> 00:25:13.490
<v Speaker 1>be strong enough to withstand tragedy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if that was the case?</v>

433
00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:14.323
<v Speaker 1>So the idea here being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you are the person who notes </v>

434
00:25:17.061 --> 00:25:19.970
<v Speaker 1>that his or her friends don't exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>trust,</v>

435
00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.700
<v Speaker 1>trust him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

436
00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:25.010
<v Speaker 1>Well to hide away?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just walk away.</v>

437
00:25:25.011 --> 00:25:26.750
<v Speaker 1>And then of course you never learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

438
00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.610
<v Speaker 1>But let's say by contrast you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

439
00:25:28.611 --> 00:25:29.300
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

440
00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.420
<v Speaker 1>The first time you get any evidence that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not 100% trusted,</v>

441
00:25:32.421 --> 00:25:33.110
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

442
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.943
<v Speaker 1>I got this Pang in my heart saying the </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication between you and I is not </v>

443
00:25:38.271 --> 00:25:41.600
<v Speaker 1>exactly straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now something's going on here.</v>

444
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:45.140
<v Speaker 1>Either you haven't got your frame of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reference with regards to me,</v>

445
00:25:45.141 --> 00:25:45.974
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or there's something wrong with the way </v>

446
00:25:46.971 --> 00:25:49.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the options.</v>

447
00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.870
<v Speaker 1>So let's have it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got this attitude and it's doing,</v>

448
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.520
<v Speaker 1>it's hurting me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me what you have to say.</v>

449
00:25:55.521 --> 00:25:57.050
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you what I have to say.</v>

450
00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:59.690
<v Speaker 1>And we'll exchange this pattern </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

451
00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.140
<v Speaker 1>And as a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gold.</v>

452
00:26:01.141 --> 00:26:02.810
<v Speaker 1>Both going to walk away a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

453
00:26:02.811 --> 00:26:05.090
<v Speaker 1>Well put together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So God says,</v>

454
00:26:05.091 --> 00:26:05.750
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

455
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:06.583
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people get distorted and twisted and </v>

456
00:26:08.931 --> 00:26:09.764
<v Speaker 1>bent and warped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's their own problem </v>

457
00:26:11.931 --> 00:26:12.764
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause they have this capacity just to </v>

458
00:26:14.061 --> 00:26:15.680
<v Speaker 1>turn away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as they turned away,</v>

459
00:26:15.681 --> 00:26:18.650
<v Speaker 1>they get weaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as they get weaker,</v>

460
00:26:18.651 --> 00:26:21.350
<v Speaker 1>the world gets worse around them because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't deal with it.</v>

461
00:26:21.351 --> 00:26:23.030
<v Speaker 1>And they keep making mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And well,</v>

462
00:26:23.031 --> 00:26:24.890
<v Speaker 1>that's a terrible consequence and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

463
00:26:24.891 --> 00:26:28.010
<v Speaker 1>But if they just wouldn't turn away to </v>
<v Speaker 1>begin with,</v>

464
00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:32.000
<v Speaker 1>then there'd be no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there wouldn't be no problem because</v>

465
00:26:32.001 --> 00:26:35.120
<v Speaker 1>the world would stop being tragic </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the world's tragic,</v>

466
00:26:35.121 --> 00:26:35.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

467
00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.000
<v Speaker 1>there you are little and vulnerable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

468
00:26:38.001 --> 00:26:42.290
<v Speaker 1>things can roll right over you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world would never lose its tragedy.</v>

469
00:26:42.291 --> 00:26:47.100
<v Speaker 1>But the idea be instead that you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>handle it without becoming corrupted and</v>

470
00:26:47.101 --> 00:26:49.980
<v Speaker 1>that would be sufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea would be,</v>

471
00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:55.170
<v Speaker 1>it's a tough situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all things considered,</v>

472
00:26:55.171 --> 00:26:58.410
<v Speaker 1>but it's also an interesting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>compelling and beautiful one.</v>

473
00:26:58.590 --> 00:26:59.423
<v Speaker 1>And it may be that if you didn't turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>away the interesting and beautiful and </v>

474
00:27:02.521 --> 00:27:06.830
<v Speaker 1>compelling aspect would overwhelm the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tragic aspect and that would be fine.</v>
