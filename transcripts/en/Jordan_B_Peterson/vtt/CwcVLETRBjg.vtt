1
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.760
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to be nice.</v>

2
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.510
<v Speaker 1>So my name is Tammy Jordan and I known </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other</v>

3
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.140
<v Speaker 1>for nearly 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nearly 50 years.</v>

4
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.653
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's better.</v>

5
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.410
<v Speaker 1>We come from northern Alberta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lived up the street from me.</v>

6
00:00:29.411 --> 00:00:32.320
<v Speaker 1>I always knew he would be a fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

7
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.933
<v Speaker 1>So in my late twenties he moved east.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in Montreal and I thought it's </v>

8
00:00:40.781 --> 00:00:41.614
<v Speaker 1>probably time to marry them because if I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't marry him I won't know what </v>

9
00:00:43.781 --> 00:00:48.640
<v Speaker 1>happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now we're seeing what's happening.</v>

10
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:50.643
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's been talking about these </v>

11
00:00:52.091 --> 00:00:52.924
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been talking about what's going on </v>

12
00:00:53.981 --> 00:00:58.981
<v Speaker 1>in our society and how it's moving left </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how things are destabilizing for the</v>

13
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.330
<v Speaker 1>last 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when in September he said he came</v>

14
00:01:07.331 --> 00:01:09.760
<v Speaker 1>down one morning and he was quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>disturbed and he said,</v>

15
00:01:09.761 --> 00:01:14.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a couple of emails that I can't</v>

16
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.220
<v Speaker 1>deal with.</v>

17
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.450
<v Speaker 1>I can't deal with quietly and I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have to say something.</v>

18
00:01:19.451 --> 00:01:20.770
<v Speaker 1>What do you think can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

19
00:01:20.771 --> 00:01:21.604
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been speaking to me and my son </v>

20
00:01:23.891 --> 00:01:27.550
<v Speaker 1>who was there to for for a very long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

21
00:01:27.551 --> 00:01:29.920
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it is time for you to tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone</v>

22
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.740
<v Speaker 1>what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he didn't know.</v>

23
00:01:34.741 --> 00:01:36.400
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know what would happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:36.401 --> 00:01:37.234
<v Speaker 1>we didn't have any idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just went up and made a video except </v>

25
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.670
<v Speaker 1>what he's said and what he's always </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought and what he sees coming down the</v>

26
00:01:45.221 --> 00:01:46.054
<v Speaker 1>pipes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it resonated with tremendous </v>

27
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.950
<v Speaker 1>response and mostly almost 95 percent or</v>
<v Speaker 1>more positive response.</v>

28
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.650
<v Speaker 1>So although it was destabilizing and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>found beginning though,</v>

29
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.700
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

30
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.610
<v Speaker 1>it's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we've worked a lot with myself.</v>

31
00:02:06.611 --> 00:02:07.444
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't as learned that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I sure liked a lot and I know you </v>

32
00:02:10.691 --> 00:02:14.320
<v Speaker 1>guys have to and you're going to learn a</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole bunch of more today.</v>

33
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.530
<v Speaker 1>So welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

34
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.850
<v Speaker 2>So who's your filming this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I walk around?</v>

35
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.430
<v Speaker 2>Can you hear me without the microphone</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I will be able to walk around.</v>

36
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.970
<v Speaker 2>So I want to tell you a story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

37
00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 2>not be as good if you're</v>

38
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 1>not on the mic is going to be broadcast.</v>

39
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.420
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

40
00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.363
<v Speaker 2>so</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started studying the things that I </v>

41
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.253
<v Speaker 2>have been talking about in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well really as long back as I can </v>

42
00:03:23.901 --> 00:03:25.910
<v Speaker 2>remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's true.</v>

43
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.470
<v Speaker 2>I wrote an essay when I was about 13 on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

44
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.390
<v Speaker 2>on Auschwitz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't very good essay but I was only</v>

45
00:03:35.391 --> 00:03:36.224
<v Speaker 2>13 so it's not that surprising but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know exactly why it was a </v>

46
00:03:41.371 --> 00:03:42.204
<v Speaker 2>particular concern to me except that of </v>
<v Speaker 2>course it's the sort of thing that </v>

47
00:03:44.631 --> 00:03:46.100
<v Speaker 2>should be of concern to everyone.</v>

48
00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.320
<v Speaker 2>How about if I speak a little louder?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

49
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.260
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I'll,</v>

50
00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.780
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it this way.</v>

51
00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:02.390
<v Speaker 2>I think if you have any trouble at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>

52
00:04:02.391 --> 00:04:04.310
<v Speaker 2>let me know what I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll make sure that I'm,</v>

53
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm projecting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I said when I was about 13,</v>

54
00:04:08.151 --> 00:04:12.020
<v Speaker 2>I wrote an essay on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on our sweats and I,</v>

55
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.190
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

56
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.033
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe I tried to understand it </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way that was somewhat different </v>

57
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.233
<v Speaker 2>than most people who examined historical</v>
<v Speaker 2>events because I was trying to </v>

58
00:04:25.041 --> 00:04:30.041
<v Speaker 2>understand how human beings could do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that knowing full well that I was one of</v>

59
00:04:32.541 --> 00:04:33.374
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then that's the critical thing because </v>

60
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:37.663
<v Speaker 2>generally when people examine especially</v>
<v Speaker 2>something horrifying that's done by </v>

61
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.430
<v Speaker 2>humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make the assumption that it's other</v>

62
00:04:46.431 --> 00:04:47.264
<v Speaker 2>people doing it and that's a big mistake</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my estimation because if a lot of </v>

63
00:04:55.191 --> 00:04:57.860
<v Speaker 2>human beings have done something </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible,</v>

64
00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:59.383
<v Speaker 2>you can be sure that</v>
<v Speaker 2>being a human being that you're capable </v>

65
00:05:04.101 --> 00:05:04.934
<v Speaker 2>of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know one of the things that </v>

66
00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:09.224
<v Speaker 2>we've been asked repeatedly to do as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of what happened in World </v>

67
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.233
<v Speaker 2>War Two is to not forget it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's always been my contention that </v>

68
00:05:21.831 --> 00:05:25.250
<v Speaker 2>you can't remember something you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand</v>

69
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.173
<v Speaker 2>and you don't understand what happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Nazi Germany or in the Soviet Union </v>

70
00:05:32.031 --> 00:05:32.864
<v Speaker 2>for that matter.</v>

71
00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.990
<v Speaker 2>Until you understand that had you been </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

72
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:37.543
<v Speaker 2>the probability that you would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>played a role and that wouldn't have </v>

73
00:05:39.861 --> 00:05:42.500
<v Speaker 2>been a positive one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is extraordinarily high.</v>

74
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.680
<v Speaker 2>When people do think about themselves as</v>
<v Speaker 2>actors in situations like that,</v>

75
00:05:47.721 --> 00:05:51.320
<v Speaker 2>they have a proclivity to cast </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves in their heroic role.</v>

76
00:05:51.321 --> 00:05:52.154
<v Speaker 2>Assuming that had they been say in Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany in the 19 thirties that they </v>

77
00:05:56.841 --> 00:06:01.841
<v Speaker 2>would taken on the burden of</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting against the Nazis and defending</v>

78
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.630
<v Speaker 2>the things that should have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>defended,</v>

79
00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:08.210
<v Speaker 2>but that's a very foolish </v>
<v Speaker 2>presupposition.</v>

80
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.583
<v Speaker 2>Especially because it's more or less </v>
<v Speaker 2>self evident from the historical </v>

81
00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:17.150
<v Speaker 2>perspective that that isn't what people </v>
<v Speaker 2>did and in order for us to come to terms</v>

82
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:22.151
<v Speaker 2>with that it means that we have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand how it happened,</v>

83
00:06:22.941 --> 00:06:27.890
<v Speaker 2>but more importantly what role we still </v>
<v Speaker 2>play as individuals in</v>

84
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.080
<v Speaker 2>acting in such a way that such things </v>
<v Speaker 2>are not only likely but desired.</v>

85
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:43.243
<v Speaker 2>When I was older and in university,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was plagued by nightmares mostly </v>

86
00:06:50.481 --> 00:06:53.390
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were apocalyptic nightmares,</v>

87
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.253
<v Speaker 2>mostly about the Third World War and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had very large long series of dreams </v>

88
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:00.283
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

89
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.190
<v Speaker 2>about nuclear bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember one of them,</v>

90
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.840
<v Speaker 2>I was living in Edmonton at the time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the</v>

91
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:13.563
<v Speaker 2>on the south side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I can remember watching out through </v>

92
00:07:17.441 --> 00:07:18.274
<v Speaker 2>my window in the dream and seeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>mushroom cloud form over the main core </v>

93
00:07:22.091 --> 00:07:22.924
<v Speaker 2>of the city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the dream shifted locales and </v>

94
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.780
<v Speaker 2>there were a bunch of people in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wreckage and they started to fight and I</v>

95
00:07:31.781 --> 00:07:32.614
<v Speaker 2>thought that's just exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was exactly what my nightmares </v>

96
00:07:36.881 --> 00:07:37.714
<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that no matter how tremendous the </v>

97
00:07:39.881 --> 00:07:40.714
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't seem able to derive the proper </v>

98
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:49.860
<v Speaker 2>conclusions from it and start to act in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a way that makes such things less rather</v>

99
00:07:50.291 --> 00:07:51.130
<v Speaker 2>than more likely.</v>

100
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.890
<v Speaker 2>When I was in graduate school at Mcgill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would have been after that,</v>

101
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.060
<v Speaker 2>I was studying political science before </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

102
00:08:01.061 --> 00:08:02.530
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back when I was in Edmonton.</v>

103
00:08:02.531 --> 00:08:05.230
<v Speaker 2>And before that I had even thought about</v>
<v Speaker 2>going into,</v>

104
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:09.160
<v Speaker 2>into law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as I studied political science,</v>

105
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:10.503
<v Speaker 2>I got increasingly disenchanted with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>explanations that were being offered to </v>

106
00:08:13.391 --> 00:08:17.530
<v Speaker 2>me about motivations for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for human conflict,</v>

107
00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:22.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that especially in the upper years of my</v>

108
00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:23.613
<v Speaker 2>undergraduate education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the lower years were pretty good </v>

109
00:08:25.601 --> 00:08:28.600
<v Speaker 2>because mostly what I studied was </v>
<v Speaker 2>political philosophy and literature.</v>

110
00:08:28.601 --> 00:08:31.270
<v Speaker 2>And I found that very helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in the upper gears,</v>

111
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:36.310
<v Speaker 2>the contention of the professors was </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people primarily</v>

112
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:39.870
<v Speaker 2>engaged in conflict for economic </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>

113
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:40.733
<v Speaker 2>That never struck me as a very deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep explanation because it didn't get </v>

114
00:08:44.351 --> 00:08:45.790
<v Speaker 2>up the core of the issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>

115
00:08:45.791 --> 00:08:47.020
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

116
00:08:47.021 --> 00:08:50.590
<v Speaker 2>people fight about things of material </v>
<v Speaker 2>value,</v>

117
00:08:50.591 --> 00:08:52.300
<v Speaker 2>but why do they value those things?</v>

118
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.133
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of self evident if you think </v>

119
00:08:53.981 --> 00:08:57.510
<v Speaker 2>about food and shelter and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but generally speaking,</v>

120
00:08:57.511 --> 00:08:58.344
<v Speaker 2>especially in the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't necessarily about the basics </v>

121
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:04.230
<v Speaker 2>of food and shelter that people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>engaging in conflict about.</v>

122
00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:05.064
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was something much more subtle than </v>

123
00:09:06.121 --> 00:09:06.954
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it had more to do with national </v>

124
00:09:08.101 --> 00:09:09.690
<v Speaker 2>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with identity,</v>

125
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.140
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there was a psychological element</v>

126
00:09:13.141 --> 00:09:16.650
<v Speaker 2>missing in the analysis of the human </v>
<v Speaker 2>propensity for conflict.</v>

127
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:17.933
<v Speaker 2>That to me bloomed larger and larger and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I decided at least in part for that </v>

128
00:09:23.071 --> 00:09:23.904
<v Speaker 2>reason to pursue a graduate degree in </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology and in clinical psychology </v>

129
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:32.750
<v Speaker 2>and I went to mcgill and that's when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>started to read very much more broadly I</v>

130
00:09:33.241 --> 00:09:35.670
<v Speaker 2>suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I spent a lot of time reading.</v>

131
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:36.653
<v Speaker 2>I read a lot of Freud and a lot of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the classic clinical psychologists who </v>

132
00:09:40.921 --> 00:09:44.700
<v Speaker 2>were extraordinarily useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carl Rogers and Sigmund Freud,</v>

133
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.313
<v Speaker 2>Alfred Adler and a whole host of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the classic thinkers I could get my </v>

134
00:09:51.031 --> 00:09:56.031
<v Speaker 2>hands on and also most particularly the </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche,</v>

135
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:57.953
<v Speaker 2>most of whose major works I read at that</v>
<v Speaker 2>point and Theodore Dostoevsky who was </v>

136
00:10:02.821 --> 00:10:05.490
<v Speaker 2>writing very similar things to it very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

137
00:10:05.491 --> 00:10:07.230
<v Speaker 2>Nisha was quite influenced by </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dostoevsky.</v>

138
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.700
<v Speaker 2>Dostoevsky was a like a master in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>literary genre,</v>

139
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.620
<v Speaker 2>has five great books</v>

140
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.213
<v Speaker 2>focused on the most difficult questions </v>
<v Speaker 2>that face humanity both socially and </v>

141
00:10:20.301 --> 00:10:21.134
<v Speaker 2>individually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found those books overwhelmingly </v>

142
00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:27.610
<v Speaker 2>powerful and also extraordinarily useful</v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond good or a credit punishment,</v>

143
00:10:28.761 --> 00:10:31.160
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a brilliant,</v>

144
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.713
<v Speaker 2>brilliant piece of work outlining the </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivation of someone who regards </v>

145
00:10:35.991 --> 00:10:36.824
<v Speaker 2>himself as above all law and who decides</v>
<v Speaker 2>that to not kill when necessary is an </v>

146
00:10:43.041 --> 00:10:43.874
<v Speaker 2>act of cowardice and so Dostoevsky walks</v>
<v Speaker 2>through his rationalization and and the </v>

147
00:10:49.851 --> 00:10:53.420
<v Speaker 2>murder and the aftermath of it in a way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's extraordinarily</v>

148
00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:56.723
<v Speaker 2>enlightening and painful simultaneously </v>
<v Speaker 2>and at the same time niche and Germany </v>

149
00:11:00.721 --> 00:11:05.721
<v Speaker 2>was writing philosophical tracts on </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly the same themes there.</v>

150
00:11:05.961 --> 00:11:08.970
<v Speaker 2>Their lives ran in in unbelievably close</v>
<v Speaker 2>parallel.</v>

151
00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.080
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Nisha finally went insane,</v>

152
00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:16.410
<v Speaker 2>he had some illness that has been very </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult to diagnose.</v>

153
00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.113
<v Speaker 2>He had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd seen someone beating a horse in a </v>

154
00:11:20.461 --> 00:11:25.260
<v Speaker 2>street and embraced it out of compassion</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a scene exactly like that in</v>

155
00:11:25.261 --> 00:11:29.490
<v Speaker 2>one of Dostoyevsky's stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's the parallels are really uncanny</v>

156
00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.473
<v Speaker 2>and I also read a lot of neuroscience </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I did my thesis on the </v>

157
00:11:36.061 --> 00:11:40.260
<v Speaker 2>biological predisposition to alcoholism </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that required a lot of investigation</v>

158
00:11:40.261 --> 00:11:41.094
<v Speaker 2>into more hardcore science investigation</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the structure and function of the </v>

159
00:11:44.461 --> 00:11:45.294
<v Speaker 2>brain and I tried to weave all of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>together in a book that I published in </v>

160
00:11:48.571 --> 00:11:51.000
<v Speaker 2>1999.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took me about 15 years to write.</v>

161
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:56.300
<v Speaker 2>I was writing three hours a day every </v>
<v Speaker 2>day and thinking about it all the time,</v>

162
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.330
<v Speaker 2>like I was absolutely 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>obsessed by</v>

163
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.710
<v Speaker 2>by the sorts of issues that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussing with you today.</v>

164
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:09.270
<v Speaker 2>It took me deep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read the Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,</v>

165
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:12.190
<v Speaker 2>much of what he wrote at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then of course I,</v>

166
00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:13.243
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

167
00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.070
<v Speaker 2>I studied Carl young in great depth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>

168
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.983
<v Speaker 2>when I finally started to crack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he was talking about was </v>

169
00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:19.654
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily difficult material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read volume nine of his collected </v>

170
00:12:23.441 --> 00:12:24.274
<v Speaker 2>works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is called archetypes of the </v>

171
00:12:24.941 --> 00:12:27.700
<v Speaker 2>collective unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At first time I read it,</v>

172
00:12:27.701 --> 00:12:28.534
<v Speaker 2>I didn't understand a word he was saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's very common </v>

173
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:36.370
<v Speaker 2>experience for people reading young </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's certainly persona non grata in the</v>

174
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.210
<v Speaker 2>modern ECAP academy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the reason for that is that</v>

175
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:46.780
<v Speaker 2>while I think when you first encountered</v>
<v Speaker 2>union attended,</v>

176
00:12:46.781 --> 00:12:47.614
<v Speaker 2>bounce off of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the next thing that happens is </v>

177
00:12:50.351 --> 00:12:53.350
<v Speaker 2>you get very frightened and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just leave it the hell alone.</v>

178
00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.810
<v Speaker 2>And it's no wonder as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned,</v>

179
00:12:55.811 --> 00:12:58.490
<v Speaker 2>because I don't think I've ever read </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone including me.</v>

180
00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.640
<v Speaker 2>Chip that was more terrifying than </v>
<v Speaker 2>young.</v>

181
00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:03.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neat.</v>

182
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.230
<v Speaker 2>Young was a student of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

183
00:13:05.231 --> 00:13:08.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean technically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although Nisha was everywhere.</v>

184
00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.750
<v Speaker 2>Niches thinking was everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When human was maturing.</v>

185
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:14.770
<v Speaker 2>People know Carl young primarily as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a disciple,</v>

186
00:13:14.771 --> 00:13:15.604
<v Speaker 2>let's say a Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is true in part because Freud of </v>

187
00:13:18.491 --> 00:13:20.730
<v Speaker 2>course did the initial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might call,</v>

188
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.070
<v Speaker 2>might describe it as initial excavating </v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

189
00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:25.083
<v Speaker 2>Outlining the fact that there was more </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on in the human psyche then that </v>

190
00:13:28.331 --> 00:13:29.164
<v Speaker 2>met the conscious I and his greatest </v>
<v Speaker 2>work likely was the interpretation of </v>

191
00:13:32.951 --> 00:13:33.784
<v Speaker 2>dreams where he started to perform an </v>
<v Speaker 2>archeology of the of the symbolic </v>

192
00:13:40.091 --> 00:13:45.091
<v Speaker 2>unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm showing that much of our mental life</v>

193
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:50.230
<v Speaker 2>went on in some sense underneath our </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious awareness,</v>

194
00:13:50.231 --> 00:13:52.880
<v Speaker 2>which is of course regarded as a truism </v>
<v Speaker 2>now by psychologists,</v>

195
00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:57.130
<v Speaker 2>but was quite revolutionary at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't Freud's.</v>

196
00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.190
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't entirely an original idea with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freud.</v>

197
00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.293
<v Speaker 2>Few things are entirely original ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he went farther than anyone else </v>

198
00:14:06.251 --> 00:14:07.084
<v Speaker 2>synthesizing it and also publicizing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>promoting it and also basing a </v>

199
00:14:10.121 --> 00:14:13.630
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapeutic theory on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really remarkable set of accomplishments</v>

200
00:14:13.631 --> 00:14:14.464
<v Speaker 2>and young was very much influenced by </v>
<v Speaker 2>Freud but also by niche and the reason </v>

201
00:14:18.941 --> 00:14:19.774
<v Speaker 2>he was influenced by nature most </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly was that niches </v>

202
00:14:24.581 --> 00:14:25.414
<v Speaker 2>announcement of the death of God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the late 19 hundreds was was a very </v>

203
00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:31.940
<v Speaker 2>striking philosophical event and and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

204
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.823
<v Speaker 2>I'll return to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Nicha believed that because God was </v>

205
00:14:36.491 --> 00:14:37.780
<v Speaker 2>dead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

206
00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:43.450
<v Speaker 2>and the value structure upon which </v>
<v Speaker 2>Western civilization was constructed,</v>

207
00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.493
<v Speaker 2>had God at its foundation that that will</v>
<v Speaker 2>all crumble and that people would have </v>

208
00:14:48.731 --> 00:14:49.564
<v Speaker 2>to become their own daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is in a sense they would have to </v>

209
00:14:52.551 --> 00:14:57.551
<v Speaker 2>discover or create furniture to create </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own values and before nature could</v>

210
00:14:58.761 --> 00:15:00.170
<v Speaker 2>outline how that might happen.</v>

211
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:05.260
<v Speaker 2>He suffered the unfortunate descent into</v>
<v Speaker 2>madness and then died,</v>

212
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:06.613
<v Speaker 2>and so we left this major,</v>
<v Speaker 2>major problem behind which is if it's </v>

213
00:15:09.531 --> 00:15:10.364
<v Speaker 2>the case that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideational foundation of Western </v>

214
00:15:16.551 --> 00:15:21.440
<v Speaker 2>civilization</v>
<v Speaker 2>was predicated on an illusion,</v>

215
00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.330
<v Speaker 2>on an illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

216
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.350
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

217
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:28.040
<v Speaker 2>What would we do next?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he just said,</v>

218
00:15:28.041 --> 00:15:28.874
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that what we will certainly do next is </v>

219
00:15:31.761 --> 00:15:36.761
<v Speaker 2>descend into an unholy combination of </v>
<v Speaker 2>nihilism and totalitarianism.</v>

220
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:42.910
<v Speaker 2>Because those will be the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>will back in most clearly in the chaotic</v>

221
00:15:43.341 --> 00:15:44.174
<v Speaker 2>aftermath of the disillusion of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>value structure upon which our society </v>

222
00:15:47.661 --> 00:15:48.494
<v Speaker 2>has been predicated and nature in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>book will to power prophesied very </v>

223
00:15:53.451 --> 00:15:54.284
<v Speaker 2>directly that millions of people would </v>
<v Speaker 2>die in the 20th century specifically </v>

224
00:15:58.581 --> 00:16:03.581
<v Speaker 2>because of Communist revolutions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was 40 years roughly speaking 30 to</v>

225
00:16:03.591 --> 00:16:07.280
<v Speaker 2>40 years before the communist revolution</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Soviet Union.</v>

226
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:12.670
<v Speaker 2>So that's an act of prophetic vision </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's absolutely incomprehensible to.</v>

227
00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:17.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean in the West.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know that the Soviet Union was</v>

228
00:16:17.001 --> 00:16:17.834
<v Speaker 2>going to fall until the day it fell and </v>
<v Speaker 2>niche and knew what was going to happen </v>

229
00:16:20.661 --> 00:16:24.890
<v Speaker 2>in the 20th century in like night in </v>
<v Speaker 2>like 1880.</v>

230
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:26.143
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Young was very interested in the </v>

231
00:16:28.971 --> 00:16:31.940
<v Speaker 2>Nietzschean problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More interested in it than anything else</v>

232
00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:33.343
<v Speaker 2>because he knew that the question of </v>
<v Speaker 2>where we would derive our values from </v>

233
00:16:37.101 --> 00:16:37.934
<v Speaker 2>and how we would ground them in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of underlying solid underwrite </v>

234
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:41.593
<v Speaker 2>lying reality would become was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>paramount psychological question of the </v>

235
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:46.543
<v Speaker 2>of the age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he spent his entire life his entire </v>

236
00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:49.424
<v Speaker 2>life attempting to address that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Young's idea was that we weren't </v>

237
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:54.553
<v Speaker 2>going to be able to create our own </v>
<v Speaker 2>values because human beings cannot </v>

238
00:16:56.541 --> 00:16:59.990
<v Speaker 2>create their own values and you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if,</v>

239
00:16:59.991 --> 00:17:03.650
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you observe your own action,</v>

240
00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.770
<v Speaker 2>if you observe your own being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can make resolutions.</v>

241
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:10.430
<v Speaker 2>You can try to act in a particular way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a way that you regard as better,</v>

242
00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.473
<v Speaker 2>but you'll find out very rapidly that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't enslave yourself and tell </v>

243
00:17:14.841 --> 00:17:15.674
<v Speaker 2>yourself what to do so easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even when you're motivated to do good </v>

244
00:17:18.021 --> 00:17:18.854
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know when you make your New Year's </v>

245
00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:23.510
<v Speaker 2>resolutions and say that you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat properly and go to the gym.</v>

246
00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:27.850
<v Speaker 2>That generally lasts about a week and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't boss yourself around.</v>

247
00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:28.693
<v Speaker 2>As it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no more than you can really boss other </v>

248
00:17:30.051 --> 00:17:32.540
<v Speaker 2>people around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's because you do have a nature.</v>

249
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:36.020
<v Speaker 2>You have a nature and you can't just </v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitrarily,</v>

250
00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:40.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mold and shape that nature because you,</v>

251
00:17:40.071 --> 00:17:42.980
<v Speaker 2>like other people will rebel against </v>
<v Speaker 2>your own will.</v>

252
00:17:42.981 --> 00:17:46.910
<v Speaker 2>And so and so young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His contention was that we would have to</v>

253
00:17:46.911 --> 00:17:49.740
<v Speaker 2>go inside ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's how he looked at it,</v>

254
00:17:49.741 --> 00:17:50.574
<v Speaker 2>into the symbolic background of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological structure and rediscover </v>

255
00:17:55.861 --> 00:17:58.260
<v Speaker 2>what we had lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so</v>

256
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:01.823
<v Speaker 2>I found that's the ancient mythological </v>
<v Speaker 2>motif of voyaging to the depths and </v>

257
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:08.970
<v Speaker 2>rescuing your father from the belly of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the beast,</v>

258
00:18:08.971 --> 00:18:13.971
<v Speaker 2>and you see that idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>reflected often in popular culture.</v>

259
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:23.220
<v Speaker 2>A very well developed example of that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Movie Pinocchio,</v>

260
00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.860
<v Speaker 2>which I'm sure how many of you have seen</v>
<v Speaker 2>that movie.</v>

261
00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:27.751
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

262
00:18:27.751 --> 00:18:29.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that speaks for itself,</v>

263
00:18:29.131 --> 00:18:29.661
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

264
00:18:29.661 --> 00:18:31.240
<v Speaker 2>there's a why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

265
00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.133
<v Speaker 2>Why are you watching a puppet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an animated puppet rescue his father </v>

266
00:18:36.331 --> 00:18:39.150
<v Speaker 2>from the belly of a whale?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes absolutely no sense,</v>

267
00:18:39.151 --> 00:18:40.560
<v Speaker 2>but you don't care when you're watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

268
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:41.423
<v Speaker 2>You think this is quite interesting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason it's interesting is because </v>

269
00:18:44.101 --> 00:18:46.890
<v Speaker 2>it speaks to you at a level that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>

270
00:18:46.891 --> 00:18:49.380
<v Speaker 2>but that you do not understand how you </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>

271
00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.670
<v Speaker 2>and of course any good work of art does </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly that to you.</v>

272
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:58.870
<v Speaker 2>It speaks to you about things that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost know but don't yet know,</v>

273
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.110
<v Speaker 2>and that's what makes it profound.</v>

274
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:03.143
<v Speaker 2>And you knew that it would be necessary </v>
<v Speaker 2>for modern people to journey to the </v>

275
00:19:07.471 --> 00:19:11.160
<v Speaker 2>chaotic depths and rescue they're dead </v>
<v Speaker 2>father from the underworld,</v>

276
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:12.023
<v Speaker 2>which is a very interesting symbolic </v>
<v Speaker 2>realization in the aftermath of </v>

277
00:19:16.051 --> 00:19:19.230
<v Speaker 2>Nietzsche statement that God had died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what you did.</v>

278
00:19:19.231 --> 00:19:20.910
<v Speaker 2>That's what he spent his entire life </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

279
00:19:20.911 --> 00:19:24.940
<v Speaker 2>And he detailed that out in a very long </v>
<v Speaker 2>series of very difficult and,</v>

280
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:27.710
<v Speaker 2>and very unsettling books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

281
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:31.050
<v Speaker 2>which people tend not to read and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

282
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:32.820
<v Speaker 2>and no wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no wonder.</v>

283
00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:34.163
<v Speaker 2>And so I read everything I could get my </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands on that young had published at </v>

284
00:19:36.721 --> 00:19:37.554
<v Speaker 2>that point and a lot of work by various </v>
<v Speaker 2>historians of religion and like Murcia </v>

285
00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:42.990
<v Speaker 2>Eliana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>

286
00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:46.560
<v Speaker 2>who's out of favor because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodernists don't like him.</v>

287
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:47.933
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

288
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:50.363
<v Speaker 2>and I put this altogether in this book </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I published in 1999 called maps of </v>

289
00:19:53.491 --> 00:19:55.920
<v Speaker 2>meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's also a very difficult book.</v>

290
00:19:55.921 --> 00:20:00.510
<v Speaker 2>And that was some somewhat purposeful </v>
<v Speaker 2>and somewhat inevitable.</v>

291
00:20:00.511 --> 00:20:04.260
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was purposeful because I knew that if</v>

292
00:20:04.261 --> 00:20:09.150
<v Speaker 2>I was going to discuss such things and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't make it ridiculously rigorous,</v>

293
00:20:09.151 --> 00:20:11.430
<v Speaker 2>at least to the degree that I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>capable of doing that,</v>

294
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:16.700
<v Speaker 2>that it would be easily dismissed and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems counterproductive,</v>

295
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:18.503
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was also because I was trying to </v>

296
00:20:20.191 --> 00:20:22.620
<v Speaker 2>figure out rather than trying to write a</v>
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>

297
00:20:22.621 --> 00:20:23.454
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to figure something out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was doing that by writing because </v>

298
00:20:26.131 --> 00:20:26.964
<v Speaker 2>writing is a very good way of figuring </v>
<v Speaker 2>things out and I was trying to make it </v>

299
00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:33.480
<v Speaker 2>as clear as I could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that wasn't all that clear.</v>

300
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:38.210
<v Speaker 2>It's about 500 pages long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this book and it's and I,</v>

301
00:20:38.211 --> 00:20:41.520
<v Speaker 2>I think I rewrote every sentence in it </v>
<v Speaker 2>at least 50 times,</v>

302
00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:43.960
<v Speaker 2>probably too many times because by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>end it got.</v>

303
00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:46.800
<v Speaker 2>I think I over edited it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was,</v>

304
00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:50.840
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in some sense too tight to it.</v>

305
00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:51.923
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's like an overworked piece </v>
<v Speaker 2>of art that that might be one way of </v>

306
00:20:54.041 --> 00:20:54.970
<v Speaker 2>thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

307
00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.213
<v Speaker 2>And then it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's taken me decades of speaking about </v>

308
00:20:57.761 --> 00:21:01.930
<v Speaker 2>it to continue to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you call it?</v>

309
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:02.913
<v Speaker 2>Purify and refine it so that I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>discuss it without having to go through </v>

310
00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:07.893
<v Speaker 2>dozens of hours of explanation and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>condense it down into something that's </v>

311
00:21:11.381 --> 00:21:12.214
<v Speaker 2>more easily comprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what I'm going to try to do </v>

312
00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:16.773
<v Speaker 2>this afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to tell you why I think we're in </v>

313
00:21:19.631 --> 00:21:22.840
<v Speaker 2>the position that we're in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what that position is,</v>

314
00:21:22.841 --> 00:21:23.674
<v Speaker 2>and also potentially what can be done </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it and those seams because also I </v>

315
00:21:28.241 --> 00:21:32.050
<v Speaker 2>believed and still do believe that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually understand the problem,</v>

316
00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.640
<v Speaker 2>you can solve it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but but you have.</v>

317
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:36.910
<v Speaker 2>That's actually an indication of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding.</v>

318
00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:37.930
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

319
00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:39.910
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you haven't solved it,</v>

320
00:21:39.911 --> 00:21:40.744
<v Speaker 2>you actually don't understand that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's things about it that you still </v>

321
00:21:42.371 --> 00:21:43.204
<v Speaker 2>don't grasp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when I was writing maps of </v>

322
00:21:45.251 --> 00:21:46.084
<v Speaker 2>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't so much trying to only figure </v>

323
00:21:48.191 --> 00:21:49.024
<v Speaker 2>out why it was that people were capable </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the terribly barbaric things that </v>

324
00:21:51.881 --> 00:21:52.714
<v Speaker 2>they so happily did at Auschwitz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also to figure out what could be </v>

325
00:21:55.931 --> 00:21:57.640
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if anything,</v>

326
00:21:58.150 --> 00:21:58.983
<v Speaker 2>to stop that from happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it was also by no means self </v>

327
00:22:01.261 --> 00:22:05.110
<v Speaker 2>evident that anything in fact could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>done about it because that might just be</v>

328
00:22:05.111 --> 00:22:05.944
<v Speaker 2>an expression of that central human </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature that I was talking about earlier </v>

329
00:22:08.681 --> 00:22:11.320
<v Speaker 2>and the fundamentally irreparable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's.</v>

330
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:12.183
<v Speaker 2>There's been no shortage of writers </v>
<v Speaker 2>who've proposed that human beings are </v>

331
00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:16.923
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally flawed in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>cannot be rectified and that are and we </v>

332
00:22:21.521 --> 00:22:23.860
<v Speaker 2>have a catastrophic destiny waiting for </v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

333
00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:24.873
<v Speaker 2>As a consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean in some sense that's built right </v>

334
00:22:26.741 --> 00:22:27.574
<v Speaker 2>into the fabric of Christianity itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of course at least certain </v>

335
00:22:30.311 --> 00:22:31.144
<v Speaker 2>variants of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm speaking about Christianity </v>

336
00:22:32.681 --> 00:22:33.514
<v Speaker 2>because in many ways it's at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>foundation of Western Society because </v>

337
00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:37.563
<v Speaker 2>certain elements of Christianity at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least regard people as irretrievably or </v>

338
00:22:41.471 --> 00:22:42.304
<v Speaker 2>irreparably tainted with original sin </v>
<v Speaker 2>which emerged right at the birth of our </v>

339
00:22:47.411 --> 00:22:48.244
<v Speaker 2>species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's something extraordinarily </v>

340
00:22:49.511 --> 00:22:52.930
<v Speaker 2>powerful about that idea because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>course everybody in this room knows that</v>

341
00:22:52.931 --> 00:22:53.764
<v Speaker 2>they're seriously flawed and also knows </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they do things that make those </v>

342
00:22:57.161 --> 00:22:57.994
<v Speaker 2>flaws more rather than less likely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everyone has that sense about </v>

343
00:23:01.091 --> 00:23:01.924
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless they're narcissistic beyond </v>

344
00:23:05.201 --> 00:23:07.900
<v Speaker 2>belief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In which case they also suspected.</v>

345
00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:08.763
<v Speaker 2>But only at an unconscious level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we do carry this sense of ourselves </v>

346
00:23:12.371 --> 00:23:15.140
<v Speaker 2>as deeply flawed and imperfect and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

347
00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:19.270
<v Speaker 2>and maybe fatally so and that seems to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be built right into us.</v>

348
00:23:19.271 --> 00:23:23.650
<v Speaker 2>And so maybe there is no solution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that seemed like a dismal hypothesis</v>

349
00:23:23.651 --> 00:23:24.484
<v Speaker 2>to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I wanted to do as in I wanted to </v>

350
00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.313
<v Speaker 2>investigate as deeply as I possibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>could to see if I could conjure up </v>

351
00:23:32.531 --> 00:23:35.290
<v Speaker 2>something that vaguely rick represented </v>
<v Speaker 2>the solution</v>

352
00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.350
<v Speaker 2>for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

353
00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:45.590
<v Speaker 2>there were months when I was writing</v>
<v Speaker 2>where really felt quite mad</v>

354
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:48.223
<v Speaker 3>and what the one of the most intense </v>
<v Speaker 3>periods of time where that occurred was </v>

355
00:23:52.761 --> 00:23:53.594
<v Speaker 3>when I think I was kind of on the cusp </v>
<v Speaker 3>of figuring out what I needed to figure </v>

356
00:23:57.711 --> 00:23:59.300
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd figured out two things.</v>

357
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:02.780
<v Speaker 3>One was that I kind of understood </v>
<v Speaker 3>finally,</v>

358
00:24:02.781 --> 00:24:05.390
<v Speaker 3>white people had belief systems and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't</v>

359
00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:08.403
<v Speaker 3>the belief system was there because we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to deal with an infinitely complex </v>

360
00:24:12.081 --> 00:24:12.914
<v Speaker 3>world and we have to simplify it down to</v>
<v Speaker 3>proportions that we can manage because </v>

361
00:24:15.591 --> 00:24:16.424
<v Speaker 3>we don't have infinite cognitive or </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotional or physiological resources </v>

362
00:24:19.311 --> 00:24:23.510
<v Speaker 3>were very bounded creatures living in an</v>
<v Speaker 3>unbounded environment.</v>

363
00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:24.493
<v Speaker 3>Roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's too much for us and so we have to </v>

364
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:30.820
<v Speaker 3>impose structures of simplification on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world or or we we,</v>

365
00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:35.090
<v Speaker 3>we get so stressed we die that that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly the bottom line.</v>

366
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:37.423
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you develop posttraumatic stress </v>

367
00:24:38.511 --> 00:24:39.344
<v Speaker 3>disorder which occurs when you encounter</v>
<v Speaker 3>something in your life that you cannot </v>

368
00:24:41.601 --> 00:24:43.790
<v Speaker 3>compute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>

369
00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:46.670
<v Speaker 3>your body goes into emergency </v>
<v Speaker 3>preparation mode,</v>

370
00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:47.913
<v Speaker 3>which which makes it hyper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hyper responsive to threat and ready to </v>

371
00:24:51.771 --> 00:24:52.604
<v Speaker 3>do anything which is emergency </v>
<v Speaker 3>preparation and that's so </v>

372
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:55.423
<v Speaker 3>physiologically demanding that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>demolishes your health is not merely </v>

373
00:24:58.551 --> 00:24:59.300
<v Speaker 3>psychological.</v>

374
00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:00.860
<v Speaker 3>It damages your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it,</v>

375
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:04.640
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just can't stay in high gear running</v>

376
00:25:04.641 --> 00:25:09.641
<v Speaker 3>flat out continually u dot and so people</v>
<v Speaker 3>need to simplify the world.</v>

377
00:25:10.611 --> 00:25:14.240
<v Speaker 3>They need to live within structures of </v>
<v Speaker 3>simplification because that's how they.</v>

378
00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:18.110
<v Speaker 3>That's how they protect themselves from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the terrible onslaught of complexity,</v>

379
00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:21.530
<v Speaker 3>but by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we organize ourselves into these,</v>

380
00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:25.430
<v Speaker 3>these structures of simplification.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what our cultures are.</v>

381
00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:28.580
<v Speaker 3>We negotiate them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we inhabit them jointly,</v>

382
00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:30.013
<v Speaker 3>and because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we run into people who do that </v>

383
00:25:31.641 --> 00:25:32.474
<v Speaker 3>differently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the probability that we'll engage in </v>

384
00:25:34.161 --> 00:25:34.994
<v Speaker 3>conflict is extraordinarily high because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't give up my beliefs just because </v>

385
00:25:37.851 --> 00:25:41.270
<v Speaker 3>you have different beliefs and if we </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have the same beliefs,</v>

386
00:25:41.271 --> 00:25:43.580
<v Speaker 3>then we can't peacefully occupied the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same territory,</v>

387
00:25:43.581 --> 00:25:46.970
<v Speaker 3>so there's seems to be nothing for that </v>
<v Speaker 3>except conflict.</v>

388
00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:49.820
<v Speaker 3>If we can't negotiate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we have to fight.</v>

389
00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:52.430
<v Speaker 3>So then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's,</v>

390
00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:53.930
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's that.</v>

391
00:25:53.931 --> 00:25:55.040
<v Speaker 3>Then on the one hand,</v>

392
00:25:57.190 --> 00:26:02.190
<v Speaker 2>the cat and our belief systems because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they structure our realities and protect</v>

393
00:26:02.801 --> 00:26:03.634
<v Speaker 2>us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

394
00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:08.100
<v Speaker 2>and we can't fight because now we're so </v>
<v Speaker 2>technologically powerful that if we do,</v>

395
00:26:08.101 --> 00:26:09.600
<v Speaker 2>we're going to destroy everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

396
00:26:09.601 --> 00:26:10.420
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's that.</v>

397
00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:14.460
<v Speaker 2>There's option one and its opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That completely exhausts the options.</v>

398
00:26:14.461 --> 00:26:15.294
<v Speaker 2>And so that was a horrible realization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely dreadful realization because </v>

399
00:26:19.231 --> 00:26:20.064
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly possible if you think </v>

400
00:26:20.971 --> 00:26:24.410
<v Speaker 2>about this from a biological or an </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary viewpoint,</v>

401
00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:25.253
<v Speaker 2>is that we're kind of a peculiar species</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we've developed these terrible </v>

402
00:26:28.141 --> 00:26:28.974
<v Speaker 2>technologies of war and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely no reason to assume that we </v>

403
00:26:31.351 --> 00:26:33.600
<v Speaker 2>won't just use them to wipe ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and you know,</v>

404
00:26:33.601 --> 00:26:34.434
<v Speaker 2>maybe 30 percent of us as individuals </v>
<v Speaker 2>and in our own psyches would be happy </v>

405
00:26:38.761 --> 00:26:39.594
<v Speaker 2>about that because life is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>dreadful and it's full of suffering and </v>

406
00:26:42.301 --> 00:26:43.134
<v Speaker 2>there's lots of that are harsh about </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence and so maybe we should just </v>

407
00:26:45.871 --> 00:26:50.340
<v Speaker 2>let the whole thing go and believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are plenty motivated to do that.</v>

408
00:26:50.341 --> 00:26:54.810
<v Speaker 2>If you haven't observed that motivation </v>
<v Speaker 2>in yourself at some point in your life,</v>

409
00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:59.040
<v Speaker 2>either you're not paying attention or </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to pay attention or something</v>

410
00:26:59.041 --> 00:27:01.710
<v Speaker 2>sufficiently dreadful has not yet </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to you,</v>

411
00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.930
<v Speaker 2>but it will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will,</v>

412
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:09.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because everyone encounters catastrophic</v>

413
00:27:09.271 --> 00:27:10.104
<v Speaker 2>crisis in their life and it drops the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom out of them and makes them </v>

414
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:15.570
<v Speaker 2>desperate and angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

415
00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:18.180
<v Speaker 2>and that's also part of the human </v>
<v Speaker 2>condition.</v>

416
00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:23.530
<v Speaker 2>Luckily after about three months of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about that,</v>

417
00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:28.420
<v Speaker 2>I had a series of dreams that helped me </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort out a third alternative,</v>

418
00:27:28.421 --> 00:27:30.520
<v Speaker 2>and that was of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in part</v>

419
00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.360
<v Speaker 2>emerged as a consequence of all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that I was reading,</v>

420
00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:35.413
<v Speaker 2>so</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want recert return to the Nietzschean </v>

421
00:27:42.131 --> 00:27:44.410
<v Speaker 2>conundrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

422
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:51.800
<v Speaker 2>Nisha was an extraordinarily astute </v>
<v Speaker 2>critic of the Judeo Christian tradition.</v>

423
00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:56.713
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>

424
00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:59.720
<v Speaker 2>He wrote a book called the antichrist in</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact,</v>

425
00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:01.243
<v Speaker 2>and he also said that he philosophizes </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a hammer and what he meant by that </v>

426
00:28:04.821 --> 00:28:09.470
<v Speaker 2>was that he was taking the hardest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heaviest object he could and smashing up</v>

427
00:28:09.471 --> 00:28:10.304
<v Speaker 2>everything he possibly could with as </v>
<v Speaker 2>much intellectual rigor as he could </v>

428
00:28:13.071 --> 00:28:15.740
<v Speaker 2>manage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was plenty because he was truly</v>

429
00:28:15.741 --> 00:28:17.720
<v Speaker 2>a genius,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was.</v>

430
00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:20.710
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't a nihilistic person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quite the contrary,</v>

431
00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.120
<v Speaker 2>had a very good reputation among those </v>
<v Speaker 2>who knew him,</v>

432
00:28:23.121 --> 00:28:24.710
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a very kind man,</v>

433
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:28.220
<v Speaker 2>but he was in part looking for something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he couldn't destroy.</v>

434
00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:29.293
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's partly how you find out </v>

435
00:28:30.891 --> 00:28:33.470
<v Speaker 2>what's real you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You hit things so to speak.</v>

436
00:28:33.471 --> 00:28:35.450
<v Speaker 2>You push against the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your children do that to you.</v>

437
00:28:35.451 --> 00:28:36.284
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they push against you to see where you </v>

438
00:28:38.271 --> 00:28:39.820
<v Speaker 2>won't yield and then they think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

439
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:41.930
<v Speaker 2>there's reality there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a wall there.</v>

440
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.823
<v Speaker 2>I can't go beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what Nisha was searching for </v>

441
00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:48.110
<v Speaker 2>and he was doing it all out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally,</v>

442
00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:54.040
<v Speaker 2>how his contention was that what had </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened in the West was that there that</v>

443
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:55.303
<v Speaker 2>the Judeo Christian tradition and even </v>
<v Speaker 2>the precursors of that tradition upon </v>

444
00:28:58.571 --> 00:28:59.404
<v Speaker 2>which from which that tradition he </v>
<v Speaker 2>merged had insisted for millennia that </v>

445
00:29:04.761 --> 00:29:05.594
<v Speaker 2>the pursuit of truth was the highest </v>
<v Speaker 2>moral value and that one of the </v>

446
00:29:07.971 --> 00:29:09.800
<v Speaker 2>consequences of that was that</v>

447
00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:13.323
<v Speaker 2>the west developed science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was part of that pursuit of the </v>

448
00:29:15.491 --> 00:29:16.324
<v Speaker 2>truth and then and then the tools of </v>
<v Speaker 2>science once successfully grasped and </v>

449
00:29:23.441 --> 00:29:27.310
<v Speaker 2>universalized were then turned against </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dogmatic structure of the church.</v>

450
00:29:27.311 --> 00:29:30.520
<v Speaker 2>When everyone woke up as scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak and thought,</v>

451
00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:32.363
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're living by a set of superstitions </v>

452
00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:40.850
<v Speaker 2>and and they're not true</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we have to with them.</v>

453
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:44.050
<v Speaker 2>And so that was copernicus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Darwin,</v>

454
00:29:44.051 --> 00:29:44.884
<v Speaker 2>and that was Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was these repeated blows that </v>

455
00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:51.220
<v Speaker 2>that are symbolic culture took at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands of something that had fostered and</v>

456
00:29:51.221 --> 00:29:52.180
<v Speaker 2>created and</v>

457
00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:05.483
<v Speaker 2>Nisha said something as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the same time when you remarked on </v>

458
00:30:08.491 --> 00:30:11.100
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on this consequences,</v>

459
00:30:11.101 --> 00:30:13.860
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the most terrible things about</v>

460
00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:16.253
<v Speaker 2>discovering</v>
<v Speaker 2>that assist them you believed in no </v>

461
00:30:19.861 --> 00:30:24.861
<v Speaker 2>longer functions is no longer sufficient</v>
<v Speaker 2>or can be undermined,</v>

462
00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:31.080
<v Speaker 2>is that it raises the specter that all </v>
<v Speaker 2>such systems have the same flaws.</v>

463
00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:32.623
<v Speaker 2>You know sometimes you can jump from</v>
<v Speaker 2>atheism to Christianity and from </v>

464
00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:40.710
<v Speaker 2>Christianity to socialism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say in success of leaps,</v>

465
00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:41.963
<v Speaker 2>and then you're someone who's faithless </v>
<v Speaker 2>from within the perspective of a given </v>

466
00:30:45.271 --> 00:30:46.104
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're faithful to the idea that </v>

467
00:30:47.641 --> 00:30:49.860
<v Speaker 2>there are in fact systems that will </v>
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>

468
00:30:49.861 --> 00:30:54.000
<v Speaker 2>but if your system fails enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can end up in a situation where</v>

469
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:55.133
<v Speaker 2>you don't even have any faith in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that systems as such can work and </v>

470
00:31:00.361 --> 00:31:03.780
<v Speaker 2>that makes you nihilistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Nisha saw that as,</v>

471
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:05.063
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

472
00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.860
<v Speaker 2>as the origin of the specter of </v>
<v Speaker 2>nihilism,</v>

473
00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:09.600
<v Speaker 2>hopelessness.</v>

474
00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.433
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's more complicated than that </v>

475
00:31:12.451 --> 00:31:14.970
<v Speaker 2>because there are underground reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

476
00:31:14.971 --> 00:31:15.804
<v Speaker 2>for being nihilistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have nothing to do with the mirror </v>

477
00:31:17.411 --> 00:31:22.020
<v Speaker 2>collapse of irrational belief system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we'll talk about those too,</v>

478
00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:27.000
<v Speaker 2>and he also talked about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

479
00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.193
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the inevitable rise of totalitarianism </v>

480
00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:36.060
<v Speaker 2>as a medication for the loss of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning.</v>

481
00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:37.950
<v Speaker 2>In some sense you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

482
00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:41.130
<v Speaker 2>if you're in a chaotic state because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>no longer know what to believe,</v>

483
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:42.263
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and someone offers you a set of </v>

484
00:31:44.431 --> 00:31:45.264
<v Speaker 2>certainties to guide your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By then it's very attractive for you to </v>

485
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:54.060
<v Speaker 2>reach out and grip onto those with all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of your soul,</v>

486
00:31:54.061 --> 00:31:57.870
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that stops you from merely being</v>

487
00:31:57.890 --> 00:32:00.750
<v Speaker 2>adrift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's underground reasons for</v>

488
00:32:00.751 --> 00:32:02.850
<v Speaker 2>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That all also returned to.</v>

489
00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:11.930
<v Speaker 2>So the first question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it necessary</v>

490
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:14.333
<v Speaker 2>for the sense of truth that needs you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>described as developed by the Judeo </v>

491
00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.073
<v Speaker 2>Christian tradition that then manifested</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself in the scientific methodology to </v>

492
00:32:24.241 --> 00:32:29.190
<v Speaker 2>turn against the symbolic foundation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that structure and demolish it?</v>

493
00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:34.550
<v Speaker 2>Was that inevitable and wasn't correct?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the first question.</v>

494
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.353
<v Speaker 2>And so the answer to that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conflict between science and </v>

495
00:32:47.421 --> 00:32:48.254
<v Speaker 2>religion is a consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>immature state of both of those domains </v>

496
00:32:54.051 --> 00:32:54.884
<v Speaker 2>of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not built into the structure per </v>

497
00:32:57.261 --> 00:32:58.094
<v Speaker 2>se,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just that we aren't good enough at </v>

498
00:32:59.841 --> 00:33:00.674
<v Speaker 2>being religious or good enough about at </v>
<v Speaker 2>being scientific in order to see how </v>

499
00:33:04.041 --> 00:33:06.780
<v Speaker 2>they might be reconciled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that's a,</v>

500
00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.360
<v Speaker 2>that's a hell of a claim</v>

501
00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:10.863
<v Speaker 2>mean it's a frightening claim because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this speaks to some degree to the </v>

502
00:33:13.731 --> 00:33:15.860
<v Speaker 2>underground reasons for being </v>
<v Speaker 2>nihilistic.</v>

503
00:33:15.861 --> 00:33:16.694
<v Speaker 2>So the terrible thing about being </v>
<v Speaker 2>nihilistic is that nothing you do has </v>

504
00:33:19.521 --> 00:33:20.354
<v Speaker 2>any meaning.</v>

505
00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.823
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

506
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:23.683
<v Speaker 2>and that's not so good because actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually untrue because there are </v>

507
00:33:28.551 --> 00:33:32.180
<v Speaker 2>forms of meaning in life that nihilism </v>
<v Speaker 2>will protect you from or,</v>

508
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:34.063
<v Speaker 2>or even increase your exposure to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those are the tragic meanings of </v>

509
00:33:37.341 --> 00:33:39.440
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care how nihilistic you are,</v>

510
00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.513
<v Speaker 2>what you don't believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to believe in your own </v>

511
00:33:42.711 --> 00:33:43.544
<v Speaker 2>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to believe in your own </v>

512
00:33:44.421 --> 00:33:45.254
<v Speaker 2>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to believe in the fact of </v>

513
00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:50.210
<v Speaker 2>pain and anxiety for everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to believe in tragedy.</v>

514
00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.193
<v Speaker 2>You can't think yourself out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe of the world by being </v>

515
00:33:54.321 --> 00:33:57.830
<v Speaker 2>nihilistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the negative meanings remain.</v>

516
00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:00.920
<v Speaker 2>You can dispense with the positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>meetings,</v>

517
00:34:00.921 --> 00:34:01.754
<v Speaker 2>which seems to be a bad bargain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the upside of doing that is quite </v>

518
00:34:04.041 --> 00:34:06.230
<v Speaker 2>straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I said to you,</v>

519
00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:08.570
<v Speaker 2>here's your alternatives,</v>

520
00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:12.880
<v Speaker 2>nothing you do matters or has any </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning.</v>

521
00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:14.673
<v Speaker 2>Alternative one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything you do matters and has </v>

522
00:34:18.011 --> 00:34:20.590
<v Speaker 2>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which one would you pick?</v>

523
00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:21.910
<v Speaker 2>And you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

524
00:34:21.911 --> 00:34:22.744
<v Speaker 2>of course I would go for the second </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative because the first one is so </v>

525
00:34:25.451 --> 00:34:26.284
<v Speaker 2>horrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the truth of the matter is the </v>

526
00:34:28.271 --> 00:34:29.104
<v Speaker 2>second one is even more horrifying </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it means that the things that </v>

527
00:34:32.321 --> 00:34:33.154
<v Speaker 2>you do for better or worse actually do </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter and in some sense you're </v>

528
00:34:37.751 --> 00:34:38.584
<v Speaker 2>responsible for them not only for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>effect that they have on you in the </v>

529
00:34:41.291 --> 00:34:42.124
<v Speaker 2>immediate circumstances of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for the effect that they have </v>

530
00:34:44.651 --> 00:34:45.484
<v Speaker 2>radiating out from you to others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other people that your network too </v>

531
00:34:49.211 --> 00:34:52.060
<v Speaker 2>and also as they read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as they,</v>

532
00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:53.013
<v Speaker 2>as they make waves through time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It couldn't be that everything you do </v>

533
00:34:56.051 --> 00:34:58.480
<v Speaker 2>does matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That every choice that you make matters,</v>

534
00:34:58.481 --> 00:34:59.314
<v Speaker 2>and I do believe that that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're constantly making choices </v>

535
00:35:02.261 --> 00:35:03.094
<v Speaker 2>between good and evil and that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>determines the destiny of being and it </v>

536
00:35:07.211 --> 00:35:08.044
<v Speaker 2>isn't obvious to me at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's something that you would </v>

537
00:35:09.581 --> 00:35:10.414
<v Speaker 2>wish upon yourself and so one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>advantages to be nihilistic is it </v>

538
00:35:13.691 --> 00:35:14.524
<v Speaker 2>enables you to be totally irresponsible </v>
<v Speaker 2>even though the price you pay for that </v>

539
00:35:17.771 --> 00:35:19.750
<v Speaker 2>is the sacrifice of all positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning.</v>

540
00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:21.423
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much for the intellectual purity of </v>

541
00:35:22.571 --> 00:35:23.720
<v Speaker 2>nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

542
00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:25.053
<v Speaker 2>And so those sorts of things have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>considered very deeply because when </v>

543
00:35:28.421 --> 00:35:29.260
<v Speaker 2>someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

544
00:35:29.261 --> 00:35:31.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm hopeless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it's because they're suffering</v>

545
00:35:31.451 --> 00:35:33.280
<v Speaker 2>and people can suffer terribly because </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that,</v>

546
00:35:33.281 --> 00:35:37.800
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes it's because they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to be responsible for anything.</v>

547
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:43.670
<v Speaker 2>And no wonder</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to your point,</v>

548
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:49.960
<v Speaker 2>young started to examine</v>

549
00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:56.850
<v Speaker 2>religious idiation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say symbolically,</v>

550
00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:02.940
<v Speaker 2>but it's more complicated than that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you might think that the attempt</v>

551
00:36:02.941 --> 00:36:03.774
<v Speaker 2>to analyze religious thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>symbolically would reduce it to nothing </v>

552
00:36:07.381 --> 00:36:08.214
<v Speaker 2>about psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that isn't what happens precisely </v>

553
00:36:11.641 --> 00:36:14.910
<v Speaker 2>because it's as you reduce the religious</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas to psychology,</v>

554
00:36:14.911 --> 00:36:15.744
<v Speaker 2>you elevate the psyche and so they meet </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the middle and this is something you </v>

555
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:20.670
<v Speaker 2>understood very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very well.</v>

556
00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:24.900
<v Speaker 2>It was for that reason that he believed </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Christ was a symbol of the self,</v>

557
00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:25.763
<v Speaker 2>the self being your full totality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That might be one way of thinking about </v>

558
00:36:29.041 --> 00:36:31.170
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything that you could conceivably be</v>

559
00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.180
<v Speaker 2>if you were everything that you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

560
00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:34.433
<v Speaker 2>and that's that potential,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that risks inside you that everyone </v>

561
00:36:36.181 --> 00:36:36.931
<v Speaker 2>knows about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

562
00:36:36.931 --> 00:36:37.764
<v Speaker 2>we also even speak about it because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>take people to task when we say you're </v>

563
00:36:40.951 --> 00:36:44.460
<v Speaker 2>not living up to your potential and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone knows what that means,</v>

564
00:36:44.461 --> 00:36:47.460
<v Speaker 2>but no one knows what it means because </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell is that potential?</v>

565
00:36:47.461 --> 00:36:49.980
<v Speaker 2>It's not something that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By definition,</v>

566
00:36:49.981 --> 00:36:53.730
<v Speaker 2>it's something that's virtual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something that is yet to be and may</v>

567
00:36:53.731 --> 00:36:54.564
<v Speaker 2>never be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we still treat it as if it's real </v>

568
00:36:56.521 --> 00:37:00.420
<v Speaker 2>and we also treat the entire world as if</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's made out of potential and I believe</v>

569
00:37:00.421 --> 00:37:02.220
<v Speaker 2>that that is the correct way of viewing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

570
00:37:02.221 --> 00:37:07.221
<v Speaker 2>It's not the dead matter of the 18th </v>
<v Speaker 2>century,</v>

571
00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:13.160
<v Speaker 2>rationalist or empiricists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the living domain of potential that</v>

572
00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:18.540
<v Speaker 2>we interact with on a regular basis from</v>
<v Speaker 2>which at least to some degree,</v>

573
00:37:18.541 --> 00:37:20.040
<v Speaker 2>we extract our own potential.</v>

574
00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:24.093
<v Speaker 2>Here's a rough outline of the story that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that young told that I've been working </v>

575
00:37:29.001 --> 00:37:29.834
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to tell it as I understand </v>

576
00:37:31.461 --> 00:37:32.294
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

577
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:37.120
<v Speaker 2>according to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

578
00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:39.550
<v Speaker 2>the selection of stories that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>encapsulated in,</v>

579
00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:44.300
<v Speaker 2>in the biblical tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world is roughly 6,000 years old.</v>

580
00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:48.290
<v Speaker 2>And of course at one level of analysis </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's palpably absurd.</v>

581
00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:49.700
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

582
00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:50.953
<v Speaker 2>and also narrow because I think to </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptualize the world has 15 billion </v>

583
00:37:55.281 --> 00:37:56.114
<v Speaker 2>years old with a developmental history </v>
<v Speaker 2>that extends across that massive amount </v>

584
00:37:59.631 --> 00:38:00.464
<v Speaker 2>of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to note that it extends </v>

585
00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:07.600
<v Speaker 2>incomprehensibly vastly outward is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>much more magnificent view of the cosmos</v>

586
00:38:08.421 --> 00:38:13.421
<v Speaker 2>than the rather constrained cosmos that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we inherited from thinkers in the Middle</v>

587
00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:17.570
<v Speaker 2>East,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say 10,000 years ago.</v>

588
00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:23.500
<v Speaker 2>But there's something about it that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>true and the truth in it seems to be its</v>

589
00:38:23.901 --> 00:38:27.830
<v Speaker 2>relationship to the origin of </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization because it is the case that</v>

590
00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:33.100
<v Speaker 2>civilization everywhere in the world of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sort that we would regard as complex</v>

591
00:38:33.711 --> 00:38:34.544
<v Speaker 2>and technologically is about 6,000 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>old and why that is is not so self </v>

592
00:38:38.651 --> 00:38:39.070
<v Speaker 2>evident.</v>

593
00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:39.903
<v Speaker 2>Although I suspect it has something to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do with how long it took us to </v>

594
00:38:42.161 --> 00:38:44.320
<v Speaker 2>reformulate ourselves after the last ice</v>
<v Speaker 2>age,</v>

595
00:38:44.321 --> 00:38:47.770
<v Speaker 2>which of course was only roughly 15,000 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

596
00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:51.850
<v Speaker 2>It's not really that far away in time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the first thing.</v>

597
00:38:51.851 --> 00:38:56.851
<v Speaker 2>But the second thing is what the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the creation stories in genesis,</v>

598
00:38:57.371 --> 00:38:59.410
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually mean because they actually mean</v>

599
00:38:59.411 --> 00:39:00.244
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what they mean is absolutely </v>

600
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:02.463
<v Speaker 2>remarkable in my estimation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm going to tell you a little </v>

601
00:39:04.661 --> 00:39:05.494
<v Speaker 2>bit about that story</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's necessary to understand </v>

602
00:39:09.671 --> 00:39:10.504
<v Speaker 2>what the story means to determine if </v>
<v Speaker 2>what Nisha said about the inevitable </v>

603
00:39:13.271 --> 00:39:18.271
<v Speaker 2>destruction of our symbolic religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures by science was inevitable and</v>

604
00:39:19.031 --> 00:39:21.640
<v Speaker 2>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the answer to that is no,</v>

605
00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:22.713
<v Speaker 2>we just didn't understand what the hell </v>
<v Speaker 2>we were doing any more than we really </v>

606
00:39:25.301 --> 00:39:27.760
<v Speaker 2>understand why we put up Christmas trees</v>
<v Speaker 2>at Christmas.</v>

607
00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:29.823
<v Speaker 2>So we do that in part because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christmas tree is a symbol of life </v>

608
00:39:32.591 --> 00:39:33.424
<v Speaker 2>because the tree is a symbol of life </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we inhabited trees for untold </v>

609
00:39:36.491 --> 00:39:37.324
<v Speaker 2>millions of years and we put lights on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the trees to symbolize the coming back </v>

610
00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:44.680
<v Speaker 2>into the darkness of Midwinter of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sun and the light.</v>

611
00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:45.993
<v Speaker 2>And so we play this symbolic game that </v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrates both life and the emergence </v>

612
00:39:49.811 --> 00:39:50.644
<v Speaker 2>of light and consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we associate that with the birth of </v>

613
00:39:52.451 --> 00:39:54.820
<v Speaker 2>the savior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we don't know that we're doing that,</v>

614
00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:56.370
<v Speaker 2>but we do it anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

615
00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:59.920
<v Speaker 2>and we do that sort of thing all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time because we're smarter than we know.</v>

616
00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.680
<v Speaker 2>And that has to be the case because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know ourselves.</v>

617
00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:06.220
<v Speaker 2>We would need a psychology or sociology </v>
<v Speaker 2>and anthropology or any of those things.</v>

618
00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:09.930
<v Speaker 2>If we were transparent to ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're machines,</v>

619
00:40:09.931 --> 00:40:13.270
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are far more intelligent and wise.</v>

620
00:40:13.271 --> 00:40:17.980
<v Speaker 2>Then the machines themselves can </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand and we've reveal ourselves to</v>

621
00:40:17.981 --> 00:40:18.741
<v Speaker 2>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

622
00:40:18.741 --> 00:40:21.460
<v Speaker 2>our action and our symbolic gestures </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly.</v>

623
00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:22.473
<v Speaker 2>And then have to reflect on that to try </v>
<v Speaker 2>to understand what it is that we're up </v>

624
00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:26.313
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's the idea that looks at the </v>

625
00:40:31.581 --> 00:40:33.830
<v Speaker 2>beginning of Genesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

626
00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:38.510
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's three elements that are involved</v>

627
00:40:38.511 --> 00:40:41.030
<v Speaker 2>in the creation of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of habitable,</v>

628
00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:46.650
<v Speaker 2>the creation of habitable order from </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos at the beginning of time.</v>

629
00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:50.160
<v Speaker 2>One of them is whatever is represented </v>
<v Speaker 2>by God,</v>

630
00:40:50.161 --> 00:40:50.994
<v Speaker 2>the father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of them is whatever is </v>

631
00:40:52.051 --> 00:40:55.950
<v Speaker 2>represented by the chaos that exists at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same time.</v>

632
00:40:56.070 --> 00:41:00.030
<v Speaker 2>And the other is whatever is represented</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the idea of God's word.</v>

633
00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:02.220
<v Speaker 2>That's the logos from a Christian </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

634
00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:03.750
<v Speaker 2>which is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very strange idea.</v>

635
00:41:03.751 --> 00:41:04.584
<v Speaker 2>So there's this idea that was developed </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the course of thousands of years </v>

636
00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:12.970
<v Speaker 2>that a redeeming savior was also the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that God used to extract habitable</v>

637
00:41:14.041 --> 00:41:16.080
<v Speaker 2>order out of chaos at the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

638
00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:17.333
<v Speaker 2>It's a very strange idea and and to to </v>
<v Speaker 2>assimilate an idea of that </v>

639
00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:22.553
<v Speaker 2>preposterousness and magnitude to mirror</v>
<v Speaker 2>pre irrational superstition is foolish </v>

640
00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.190
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we don't even understand what it</v>

641
00:41:29.191 --> 00:41:30.024
<v Speaker 2>means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it means something outwardly </v>

642
00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 2>profound and it means something</v>

643
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.740
<v Speaker 4>that we cannot forget.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We forget that at our peril.</v>

644
00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:44.500
<v Speaker 4>The story at the beginning of Genesis </v>
<v Speaker 4>means that structure,</v>

645
00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:47.510
<v Speaker 4>that's the father,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the patriarchy,</v>

646
00:41:47.511 --> 00:41:51.050
<v Speaker 4>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>structure extracts habitable,</v>

647
00:41:51.051 --> 00:41:51.884
<v Speaker 4>order from chaos through speech.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what we do is says in genesis as </v>

648
00:41:59.211 --> 00:42:00.044
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that human beings are made in the image </v>

649
00:42:00.951 --> 00:42:05.951
<v Speaker 4>of God and that's why because we've </v>
<v Speaker 4>observed these are ancient ideas,</v>

650
00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:08.990
<v Speaker 4>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were created with so much blood and</v>

651
00:42:08.991 --> 00:42:12.500
<v Speaker 4>effort that it's incalculable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You cannot contemplate it.</v>

652
00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:15.590
<v Speaker 4>Now idea is that there's something about</v>
<v Speaker 4>the human being,</v>

653
00:42:15.591 --> 00:42:16.424
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is that makes us conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that interacts with the chaotic </v>

654
00:42:19.491 --> 00:42:20.324
<v Speaker 4>potential that constitutes reality and </v>
<v Speaker 4>extracts out from that the order within </v>

655
00:42:24.351 --> 00:42:25.184
<v Speaker 4>which we live and that there's something</v>
<v Speaker 4>divine about that and that's the value </v>

656
00:42:29.241 --> 00:42:30.320
<v Speaker 4>of the human being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

657
00:42:30.321 --> 00:42:31.154
<v Speaker 4>That's the ineradicable value of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>human being and the idea that each </v>

658
00:42:34.731 --> 00:42:36.320
<v Speaker 4>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even criminals,</v>

659
00:42:36.321 --> 00:42:37.154
<v Speaker 4>even murderers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the worst and most reprehensible people </v>

660
00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:40.693
<v Speaker 4>have to be treated with the respect due </v>
<v Speaker 4>a divinity because we partake in the </v>

661
00:42:45.081 --> 00:42:49.580
<v Speaker 4>capacity to extract habitable order from</v>
<v Speaker 4>chaos with our consciousness,</v>

662
00:42:49.581 --> 00:42:50.414
<v Speaker 4>with our speech and with our capacity to</v>
<v Speaker 4>communicate and we recognize insofar as </v>

663
00:42:54.141 --> 00:42:57.020
<v Speaker 4>we each recognize the other as valuable.</v>

664
00:42:58.010 --> 00:42:58.843
<v Speaker 4>It's predicated on that observation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We each have something to offer each </v>

665
00:43:01.881 --> 00:43:02.714
<v Speaker 4>other and something vital and you know </v>
<v Speaker 4>that if you engage in a real </v>

666
00:43:05.061 --> 00:43:05.894
<v Speaker 4>conversation with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a meaningful conversation that suspends </v>

667
00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:12.200
<v Speaker 4>your sense of fragile mortality for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment.</v>

668
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:16.070
<v Speaker 4>You understand that in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>communication between paypal,</v>

669
00:43:16.071 --> 00:43:16.904
<v Speaker 4>something of inestimable value emerges </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you have to pursue and you live </v>

670
00:43:21.021 --> 00:43:21.800
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

671
00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.780
<v Speaker 4>You live for that relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>

672
00:43:23.781 --> 00:43:27.050
<v Speaker 4>You live for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That discovery of that relationship,</v>

673
00:43:27.051 --> 00:43:29.030
<v Speaker 4>when you're engaged in an artistic </v>
<v Speaker 4>pursuit,</v>

674
00:43:29.031 --> 00:43:33.020
<v Speaker 4>it's the core of meaning in life and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not an illusion,</v>

675
00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:34.123
<v Speaker 4>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a manifestation of the highest </v>

676
00:43:35.961 --> 00:43:36.794
<v Speaker 4>functions of your nervous system because</v>
<v Speaker 4>what your nervous system does is </v>

677
00:43:40.341 --> 00:43:45.341
<v Speaker 4>signaled to you that you're in a place </v>
<v Speaker 4>and time that you cannot see when you're</v>

678
00:43:45.921 --> 00:43:50.540
<v Speaker 4>engaged in something meaningful you need</v>
<v Speaker 4>comes upon you and it's the cure for the</v>

679
00:43:50.541 --> 00:43:53.480
<v Speaker 4>catastrophes of tragic mortality.</v>

680
00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:57.140
<v Speaker 4>That wonderful engagement in what's </v>
<v Speaker 4>meaningful that you do,</v>

681
00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:58.033
<v Speaker 4>you can undo experience and that you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>get better at experiencing if you </v>

682
00:44:01.281 --> 00:44:02.114
<v Speaker 4>practice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's because your nervous system </v>

683
00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:08.450
<v Speaker 4>which has evolved over billions of </v>
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>

684
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:13.990
<v Speaker 4>has learned to tell you when you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>standing on the border between chaos and</v>

685
00:44:15.081 --> 00:44:15.914
<v Speaker 4>order and keeping them in balance and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what manifests itself as </v>

686
00:44:20.241 --> 00:44:21.074
<v Speaker 4>meaningful and that's the same phenomena</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's referred to in the creation </v>

687
00:44:25.161 --> 00:44:25.994
<v Speaker 4>stories in genesis and it's the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea that's reflected in this strange </v>

688
00:44:29.781 --> 00:44:30.614
<v Speaker 4>Christian insistence that the thing that</v>
<v Speaker 4>saves mankind is the same thing that </v>

689
00:44:34.261 --> 00:44:36.750
<v Speaker 4>draws order from chaos at the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 4>of time.</v>

690
00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:37.943
<v Speaker 4>It's unbelievably brilliant and we've </v>
<v Speaker 4>been trying to figure it out for who </v>

691
00:44:42.841 --> 00:44:47.700
<v Speaker 4>knows how long forever and have never </v>
<v Speaker 4>been able to fully articulate it because</v>

692
00:44:47.701 --> 00:44:50.850
<v Speaker 4>it's so complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's such a complicated idea,</v>

693
00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:53.820
<v Speaker 4>but there's nothing in the lease that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>illusory about it.</v>

694
00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:02.520
<v Speaker 4>The habitable order that is created at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the beginning of time.</v>

695
00:45:02.521 --> 00:45:03.630
<v Speaker 4>That's paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

696
00:45:03.631 --> 00:45:05.250
<v Speaker 4>Paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a walled garden.</v>

697
00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:06.893
<v Speaker 4>It's a well watered place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what he did means Paradise Means </v>

698
00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:12.870
<v Speaker 4>Paradise is a walled garden and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>where Adam and Eve are first put.</v>

699
00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:14.520
<v Speaker 4>And why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

700
00:45:14.521 --> 00:45:18.030
<v Speaker 4>it's because we do comment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>male and female form.</v>

701
00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:19.980
<v Speaker 4>That's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's part of our,</v>

702
00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:23.160
<v Speaker 4>our eternal landscape that that's how </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can think about it,</v>

703
00:45:23.161 --> 00:45:26.040
<v Speaker 4>is it's the landscape that transcends </v>
<v Speaker 4>all landscapes.</v>

704
00:45:26.041 --> 00:45:30.090
<v Speaker 4>It's the landscape that is what all </v>
<v Speaker 4>landscapes have in common.</v>

705
00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:32.190
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what makes it an archetype.</v>

706
00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:34.320
<v Speaker 4>It's a walled garden.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

707
00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:35.393
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the walls are structure and culture and </v>

708
00:45:37.021 --> 00:45:37.854
<v Speaker 4>the garden is nature and all that says </v>
<v Speaker 4>is that people live in an amalgam of </v>

709
00:45:41.071 --> 00:45:41.904
<v Speaker 4>nature and culture and of course that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>precisely the case and that's another </v>

710
00:45:45.391 --> 00:45:47.190
<v Speaker 4>variant of the order.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chaos,</v>

711
00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:49.623
<v Speaker 4>juxtaposition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>order being culture and chaos being </v>

712
00:45:51.521 --> 00:45:52.354
<v Speaker 4>nature and so we live eternally in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>balance between nature and culture and </v>

713
00:45:57.611 --> 00:46:00.730
<v Speaker 4>if it's properly balanced,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's as close to paradise as it can get,</v>

714
00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:04.000
<v Speaker 4>but paradise is flawed and why is it </v>
<v Speaker 4>flawed?</v>

715
00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:05.793
<v Speaker 4>Because there's always something lurking</v>
<v Speaker 4>in it that can turn it upside down and </v>

716
00:46:09.191 --> 00:46:10.024
<v Speaker 4>that's the snake and the reason it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>snake is because the circuits that we </v>

717
00:46:13.601 --> 00:46:14.434
<v Speaker 4>use to process the things that turn our </v>
<v Speaker 4>lives upside down is the same circuit </v>

718
00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:24.090
<v Speaker 4>that are tree dwelling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ancestors used to identify predators $60</v>

719
00:46:24.641 --> 00:46:25.474
<v Speaker 4>million years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so the symbolic structure has </v>

720
00:46:28.091 --> 00:46:28.924
<v Speaker 4>remained exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That which lies outside what you </v>

721
00:46:31.901 --> 00:46:35.350
<v Speaker 4>understand is predatory and dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

722
00:46:35.351 --> 00:46:39.640
<v Speaker 4>that's why you demonize others.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The foreign others because they do stand</v>

723
00:46:39.641 --> 00:46:40.474
<v Speaker 4>in that relationship to you and you use </v>
<v Speaker 4>extraordinarily deep circuitry to do </v>

724
00:46:43.511 --> 00:46:44.344
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but human beings being slightly smarter </v>

725
00:46:46.001 --> 00:46:46.834
<v Speaker 4>than your average chimpanzee also have </v>
<v Speaker 4>noted that the terrible Predator that </v>

726
00:46:50.411 --> 00:46:51.244
<v Speaker 4>lurks outside the domains of what you </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand is also the thing that bears </v>

727
00:46:54.461 --> 00:46:55.180
<v Speaker 4>gold.</v>

728
00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:57.610
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the Classic Dragon Myth.</v>

729
00:46:57.730 --> 00:46:58.563
<v Speaker 4>The hero goes out beyond the confines of</v>
<v Speaker 4>order and culture into the chaotic </v>

730
00:47:02.141 --> 00:47:02.974
<v Speaker 4>unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to confront the ultimate Predator who </v>

731
00:47:05.471 --> 00:47:09.310
<v Speaker 4>simultaneously offers the best that can </v>
<v Speaker 4>be possibly gathered,</v>

732
00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:12.220
<v Speaker 4>and that's what human beings are like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Predator,</v>

733
00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:13.173
<v Speaker 4>animals and prey animals simultaneously </v>
<v Speaker 4>we've learned to represent the unknown </v>

734
00:47:17.291 --> 00:47:21.880
<v Speaker 4>is that thing that threatens us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hideously with a multitude of paralyzing</v>

735
00:47:21.881 --> 00:47:26.830
<v Speaker 4>snakes in the head of Medusa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but continually also offers us precisely</v>

736
00:47:26.831 --> 00:47:27.664
<v Speaker 4>what we need to continue our movement </v>
<v Speaker 4>and everyone knows that which is why we </v>

737
00:47:31.151 --> 00:47:31.984
<v Speaker 4>go to movies that tell us that over and </v>
<v Speaker 4>over and over and over and over trying </v>

738
00:47:36.311 --> 00:47:37.144
<v Speaker 4>to learn what it means and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 4>it means and that's what it means to </v>

739
00:47:40.271 --> 00:47:45.271
<v Speaker 4>partake in the logos and the logos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason that I made the videos that I</v>

740
00:47:46.401 --> 00:47:47.234
<v Speaker 4>made in September in relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 4>free speech is because I know that </v>

741
00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:51.813
<v Speaker 4>respect for the logos and respect for </v>
<v Speaker 4>free speech are the same thing and that </v>

742
00:47:55.721 --> 00:47:56.554
<v Speaker 4>without that respect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our societies cannot maintain their </v>

743
00:47:59.111 --> 00:48:01.870
<v Speaker 4>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>differentiate and progress.</v>

744
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:02.823
<v Speaker 4>They cannot do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We use our free speech to face the </v>

745
00:48:07.451 --> 00:48:11.320
<v Speaker 4>chaotic potential of the world and its </v>
<v Speaker 4>horrors to structure it,</v>

746
00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:13.750
<v Speaker 4>to understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to communicate about it,</v>

747
00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:17.590
<v Speaker 4>and to reach consensus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the mechanism by which we adapt.</v>

748
00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:18.573
<v Speaker 4>There can be no restrictions put upon </v>
<v Speaker 4>that unless you want to sacrifice </v>

749
00:48:22.091 --> 00:48:25.960
<v Speaker 4>adaptations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I wouldn't recommend that things get</v>

750
00:48:25.961 --> 00:48:28.300
<v Speaker 4>stale,</v>
<v Speaker 4>old decay,</v>

751
00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:33.570
<v Speaker 4>dad and dangerous with extraordinary </v>
<v Speaker 4>rapidity if living people don't maintain</v>

752
00:48:34.121 --> 00:48:34.954
<v Speaker 4>their responsibility to update the state</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's no difference between that </v>

753
00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:40.173
<v Speaker 4>and diving down into the chaotic depths </v>
<v Speaker 4>and rescuing your father from the belly </v>

754
00:48:45.071 --> 00:48:47.680
<v Speaker 4>of the whale.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's exactly the same idea.</v>

755
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:48.743
<v Speaker 4>It's an ancient,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ancient idea and the reason that we </v>

756
00:48:52.211 --> 00:48:57.010
<v Speaker 4>haven't forgotten it was because </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone who forgot it died.</v>

757
00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:02.710
<v Speaker 4>So unless that's where we want to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we better stop forgetting about it.</v>

758
00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:13.843
<v Speaker 4>Nature said that after God had died,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there would be two things that would </v>

759
00:49:16.551 --> 00:49:17.384
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One would be the emergence of nihilism </v>

760
00:49:20.241 --> 00:49:22.610
<v Speaker 4>as a temptation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we already discussed nihilism.</v>

761
00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:26.300
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's a logical consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the collapse of value systems,</v>

762
00:49:26.301 --> 00:49:27.134
<v Speaker 4>but it's also a place for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>irresponsible to hide fine nihilism </v>

763
00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:33.950
<v Speaker 4>totalitarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

764
00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:36.243
<v Speaker 4>we need you to believe that once you had</v>
<v Speaker 4>experienced the collapse of one value </v>

765
00:49:39.801 --> 00:49:40.634
<v Speaker 4>system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are unlikely to put your faith in </v>

766
00:49:42.231 --> 00:49:47.231
<v Speaker 4>any value systems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then why totalitarianism particularly</v>

767
00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:48.123
<v Speaker 4>say it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's nationalistic and communitarian </v>

768
00:49:50.931 --> 00:49:53.510
<v Speaker 4>forums,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which are the two forms that we saw,</v>

769
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:58.400
<v Speaker 4>act as immense devils in the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 4>century,</v>

770
00:49:58.460 --> 00:49:59.293
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>With nationalism being pushed most </v>

771
00:50:01.221 --> 00:50:02.054
<v Speaker 4>forcefully forward by the sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>political creeds that were exemplified </v>

772
00:50:05.181 --> 00:50:06.014
<v Speaker 4>by the Nazis and with communitarianism </v>
<v Speaker 4>being put forth by the sorts of creams </v>

773
00:50:09.321 --> 00:50:11.000
<v Speaker 4>that were exemplified by the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 4>Union.</v>

774
00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:15.890
<v Speaker 4>Both absolutely catastrophic </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary dead ends.</v>

775
00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:21.430
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nationalism is easier to understand,</v>

776
00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:22.570
<v Speaker 4>I think because</v>

777
00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:25.003
<v Speaker 4>you need an identity and it has to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>collective because human beings live </v>

778
00:50:28.551 --> 00:50:29.760
<v Speaker 4>collectively.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

779
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:30.703
<v Speaker 4>it's the fact that we share an identity </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we can all sit here in this room </v>

780
00:50:34.551 --> 00:50:38.720
<v Speaker 4>peacefully because the identity is </v>
<v Speaker 4>partly who you think you are,</v>

781
00:50:38.721 --> 00:50:39.554
<v Speaker 4>but it's also partly what you expect </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the world and from others and </v>

782
00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:46.160
<v Speaker 4>because you have an identity that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>similar to you,</v>

783
00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:47.143
<v Speaker 4>you can sit together peacefully because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you expect and desire something and so </v>

784
00:50:51.321 --> 00:50:52.154
<v Speaker 4>to you and it's the same thing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what it means to have a shared </v>

785
00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:55.484
<v Speaker 4>culture and so you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to defend that culture and it </v>

786
00:50:58.191 --> 00:51:02.900
<v Speaker 4>has to be of sufficient,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say tightness or magnitude so that</v>

787
00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:03.973
<v Speaker 4>it makes sense for you to belong to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not so diverse and chaotic that it </v>

788
00:51:08.331 --> 00:51:09.164
<v Speaker 4>means nothing and I think that part of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the reason why we're seeing a return to </v>

789
00:51:13.251 --> 00:51:16.040
<v Speaker 4>nationalism in places like Europe is </v>
<v Speaker 4>because</v>

790
00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:18.523
<v Speaker 4>the European identity is so amorphous </v>
<v Speaker 4>that people can't establish a </v>

791
00:51:22.041 --> 00:51:22.874
<v Speaker 4>relationship with it and that's not a </v>
<v Speaker 4>good thing because identity is actually </v>

792
00:51:25.821 --> 00:51:27.710
<v Speaker 4>something you have to have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship with.</v>

793
00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:29.370
<v Speaker 4>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the identity,</v>

794
00:51:29.410 --> 00:51:30.243
<v Speaker 4>your identity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the identity of you within your </v>

795
00:51:31.461 --> 00:51:32.294
<v Speaker 4>family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the identity of your family within </v>

796
00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:35.473
<v Speaker 4>the small community of friends that </v>
<v Speaker 4>surround you and then the broader </v>

797
00:51:38.061 --> 00:51:38.894
<v Speaker 4>community of the town and a somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 4>broader community of the province and </v>

798
00:51:41.631 --> 00:51:44.030
<v Speaker 4>the state and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as it expands,</v>

799
00:51:44.031 --> 00:51:49.031
<v Speaker 4>it gets vague and it disperses and at </v>
<v Speaker 4>some point the identity that's universal</v>

800
00:51:49.251 --> 00:51:50.084
<v Speaker 4>is so all encompassing that it means </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing at all and leaves people </v>

801
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:55.970
<v Speaker 4>chaotic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so that's what's happening,</v>

802
00:51:55.971 --> 00:51:56.804
<v Speaker 4>at least in part in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's happening to some degree in the </v>

803
00:51:58.970 --> 00:51:59.803
<v Speaker 4>United States as well because we've been</v>
<v Speaker 4>pushed so quickly forward into adopting </v>

804
00:52:03.471 --> 00:52:08.330
<v Speaker 4>a global identity that people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>shaking because that's too amorphous for</v>

805
00:52:08.331 --> 00:52:10.070
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we pulled back and say,</v>

806
00:52:10.071 --> 00:52:10.904
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need to be around people who we </v>

807
00:52:12.261 --> 00:52:15.800
<v Speaker 4>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which is of course absolutely true.</v>

808
00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:17.173
<v Speaker 4>Now the downside of the nationalist </v>
<v Speaker 4>endeavor is that you also need to be </v>

809
00:52:20.841 --> 00:52:24.560
<v Speaker 4>around people that you aren't alike and </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't understand,</v>

810
00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:27.530
<v Speaker 4>partly because they exist and if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't take them into account,</v>

811
00:52:27.531 --> 00:52:28.850
<v Speaker 4>then you're going to have a war with </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

812
00:52:28.851 --> 00:52:29.684
<v Speaker 4>Which is a very bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But also because they have something to </v>

813
00:52:31.851 --> 00:52:32.684
<v Speaker 4>offer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we're trying to sort out the </v>

814
00:52:34.191 --> 00:52:37.730
<v Speaker 4>proper balance between differentiated </v>
<v Speaker 4>identity,</v>

815
00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:39.373
<v Speaker 4>say at the nation state level and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>global identity that seems to be </v>

816
00:52:42.081 --> 00:52:45.980
<v Speaker 4>manifesting itself partly because of our</v>
<v Speaker 4>widespread electronic communication.</v>

817
00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:47.203
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

818
00:52:47.570 --> 00:52:50.300
<v Speaker 4>nationalism beckons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're in a chaotic state,</v>

819
00:52:50.301 --> 00:52:52.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I heard the Gallup people that pollsters</v>

820
00:52:52.761 --> 00:52:55.370
<v Speaker 4>at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had never seen this made public,</v>

821
00:52:55.371 --> 00:52:58.790
<v Speaker 4>but I remember it very well said that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

822
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:01.303
<v Speaker 4>this was back when Quebec was still a </v>
<v Speaker 4>large proportion of the Quebecois </v>

823
00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:07.270
<v Speaker 4>population was still agitating for </v>
<v Speaker 4>separatism.</v>

824
00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:09.120
<v Speaker 4>I'd always looked at that and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

825
00:53:09.121 --> 00:53:14.121
<v Speaker 4>it made perfect sense because you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if cal Catholicism collapses,</v>

826
00:53:14.241 --> 00:53:15.074
<v Speaker 4>it leaves a void.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you going to fill the void </v>

827
00:53:16.431 --> 00:53:17.330
<v Speaker 4>with?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

828
00:53:17.331 --> 00:53:20.460
<v Speaker 4>it's either nihilism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which we've already discussed or well,</v>

829
00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:21.560
<v Speaker 4>or what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

830
00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:22.603
<v Speaker 4>nationalism obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the Gallup people said that if you </v>

831
00:53:24.891 --> 00:53:25.724
<v Speaker 4>are a lapsed Catholic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are 10 times more likely to be a </v>

832
00:53:27.391 --> 00:53:28.890
<v Speaker 4>separate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's perfect.</v>

833
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:31.950
<v Speaker 4>It's exactly what you'd expect because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to have an identity.</v>

834
00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:36.600
<v Speaker 4>So you turn from church to state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's fine if you believe that the</v>

835
00:53:36.601 --> 00:53:37.434
<v Speaker 4>state is the ultimate identity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's really this story that is </v>

836
00:53:41.311 --> 00:53:43.890
<v Speaker 4>being sold to people who are sold a </v>
<v Speaker 4>nationalist story.</v>

837
00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:46.990
<v Speaker 4>The state is the ultimate identity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

838
00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:50.220
<v Speaker 4>well actually that's technically wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why.</v>

839
00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:51.143
<v Speaker 4>That's why it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not wrong because it's </v>

840
00:53:52.621 --> 00:53:55.700
<v Speaker 4>ideologically wrong or morally wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Precisely it's,</v>

841
00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:57.690
<v Speaker 4>it's wrong because it's technically </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>

842
00:53:57.900 --> 00:53:58.733
<v Speaker 4>Because the problem with the state is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the state is what's uniform across </v>

843
00:54:01.531 --> 00:54:02.364
<v Speaker 4>people</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the thing is is that we need what's </v>

844
00:54:06.031 --> 00:54:06.864
<v Speaker 4>actually diverse across people in order </v>
<v Speaker 4>to rejuvenate the state and to keep it </v>

845
00:54:10.561 --> 00:54:11.394
<v Speaker 4>awake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so if you reduce individuals to </v>

846
00:54:13.621 --> 00:54:16.710
<v Speaker 4>what's homogenous about them across all </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

847
00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:21.210
<v Speaker 4>you eradicate the very variability that </v>
<v Speaker 4>allows people to adapt to new things.</v>

848
00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:24.120
<v Speaker 4>And because we're constantly being </v>
<v Speaker 4>presented with new things,</v>

849
00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:27.360
<v Speaker 4>we need to keep that individual </v>
<v Speaker 4>variability</v>

850
00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:29.173
<v Speaker 4>paramount because it's upon that </v>
<v Speaker 4>variability that the very state depends </v>

851
00:54:32.961 --> 00:54:33.794
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's actually what the West </v>

852
00:54:34.281 --> 00:54:35.114
<v Speaker 4>discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why we have always subordinated </v>

853
00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:40.010
<v Speaker 4>the state to the divinity of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual.</v>

854
00:54:40.550 --> 00:54:43.070
<v Speaker 4>And that's expressed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I already said in our,</v>

855
00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:44.593
<v Speaker 4>in our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the primacy of free speech in our </v>

856
00:54:46.731 --> 00:54:49.160
<v Speaker 4>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the cornerstone,</v>

857
00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:50.293
<v Speaker 4>the primacy of free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's because the individual has </v>

858
00:54:53.121 --> 00:54:53.954
<v Speaker 4>something to offer the state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so state identity is something that </v>

859
00:54:57.201 --> 00:54:59.930
<v Speaker 4>can only it constructure and it can </v>
<v Speaker 4>reassure,</v>

860
00:54:59.931 --> 00:55:02.930
<v Speaker 4>but it also constrains to too great a </v>
<v Speaker 4>degree,</v>

861
00:55:03.110 --> 00:55:08.110
<v Speaker 4>and so societies that become only state </v>
<v Speaker 4>immediately become old and blind,</v>

862
00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:14.060
<v Speaker 4>malevolent and collapse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's an ancient story.</v>

863
00:55:14.061 --> 00:55:14.894
<v Speaker 4>The Egyptians had this figured out 3000 </v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago in their fundamental </v>

864
00:55:17.841 --> 00:55:18.674
<v Speaker 4>mythologies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had a daddy named Cyrus who was </v>

865
00:55:20.721 --> 00:55:25.280
<v Speaker 4>threatened by his evil brothers set who </v>
<v Speaker 4>later became the Christian Satan.</v>

866
00:55:25.281 --> 00:55:26.114
<v Speaker 4>The words are related.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Etymologically and set was like scar in </v>

867
00:55:30.261 --> 00:55:31.094
<v Speaker 4>the lion king.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was waiting in the wings to for the </v>

868
00:55:34.851 --> 00:55:35.684
<v Speaker 4>old king to turn a blind eye so that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>could chop them into pieces and rule in </v>

869
00:55:41.061 --> 00:55:43.640
<v Speaker 4>a malevolent way across the entire </v>
<v Speaker 4>state.</v>

870
00:55:43.641 --> 00:55:44.474
<v Speaker 4>The Egyptians had another day at a </v>
<v Speaker 4>horace who was the son of Cyrus and the </v>

871
00:55:47.481 --> 00:55:49.040
<v Speaker 4>queen of the underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isis,</v>

872
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:50.263
<v Speaker 4>who is the eye,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Egyptian I who was the fall can </v>

873
00:55:51.981 --> 00:55:54.950
<v Speaker 4>because falcons can see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and horace was different than,</v>

874
00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:57.770
<v Speaker 4>oh cyrus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he could see what set was up to.</v>

875
00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:01.780
<v Speaker 4>He grew up outside the kingdom like King</v>
<v Speaker 4>Arthur and came back and try and find,</v>

876
00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:02.850
<v Speaker 4>overcame,</v>
<v Speaker 4>set,</v>

877
00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:04.640
<v Speaker 4>losing an eye in the process</v>

878
00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:10.210
<v Speaker 4>you overcame as evil uncle and banished </v>
<v Speaker 4>him to the corners of the world and then</v>

879
00:56:10.211 --> 00:56:11.044
<v Speaker 4>he took his eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>went into the underworld where his </v>

880
00:56:12.341 --> 00:56:12.831
<v Speaker 4>father,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

881
00:56:12.831 --> 00:56:17.350
<v Speaker 4>cyrus was living a life of a of a dead </v>
<v Speaker 4>ghosts.</v>

882
00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:21.810
<v Speaker 4>That's one way of thinking about it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he gave him his eye and that revivify to</v>

883
00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:22.653
<v Speaker 4>cyrus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cyrus and horus went back up to the </v>

884
00:56:24.281 --> 00:56:25.114
<v Speaker 4>surface from the chaotic underworld and </v>
<v Speaker 4>their union was the symbol of what the </v>

885
00:56:29.231 --> 00:56:32.860
<v Speaker 4>Pharaoh had to manifest in order to rule</v>
<v Speaker 4>Egypt properly.</v>

886
00:56:33.310 --> 00:56:36.330
<v Speaker 4>The Egyptians figured that out 3000 </v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago in their.</v>

887
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:37.303
<v Speaker 4>In their great story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's very difficult to make </v>

888
00:56:39.911 --> 00:56:41.950
<v Speaker 4>something like that and articulated </v>
<v Speaker 4>reality,</v>

889
00:56:41.951 --> 00:56:42.784
<v Speaker 4>but that's the relationship that has to </v>
<v Speaker 4>obtain between the individual and the </v>

890
00:56:45.011 --> 00:56:46.930
<v Speaker 4>state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The state is a corpse.</v>

891
00:56:47.050 --> 00:56:50.680
<v Speaker 4>The state is dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a gift that the dead have given</v>

892
00:56:50.681 --> 00:56:55.681
<v Speaker 4>to you and you have to provide it with </v>
<v Speaker 4>vision and with speech because otherwise</v>

893
00:56:56.290 --> 00:56:58.720
<v Speaker 4>it can only blunder around like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Zombie.</v>

894
00:57:01.450 --> 00:57:02.283
<v Speaker 4>You go to university,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you become educated so that you can </v>

895
00:57:04.271 --> 00:57:07.870
<v Speaker 4>serve as the eye and the mouth of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>rejuvenated state.</v>

896
00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:08.733
<v Speaker 4>That's the purpose of developing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say had an education in the humanities </v>

897
00:57:11.711 --> 00:57:16.180
<v Speaker 4>when there was still such a thing left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's the purpose of that education</v>

898
00:57:16.181 --> 00:57:17.014
<v Speaker 4>is to turn you into the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>ensures that the entire ship doesn't </v>

899
00:57:20.471 --> 00:57:24.540
<v Speaker 4>founder in sync and that's your </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsibility and if you're looking for</v>

900
00:57:24.541 --> 00:57:27.340
<v Speaker 4>a meaning in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the meaning.</v>

901
00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:30.310
<v Speaker 4>Keep the state afloat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

902
00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:31.173
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's better for us all to be in </v>

903
00:57:32.381 --> 00:57:36.160
<v Speaker 4>a ship than drowning in the icy water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's the alternative.</v>

904
00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:37.353
<v Speaker 4>No one if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you find that the tragedy of life is </v>

905
00:57:40.151 --> 00:57:40.984
<v Speaker 4>too much for you to bear without </v>
<v Speaker 4>becoming resentful and bitter and </v>

906
00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:44.853
<v Speaker 4>murderous and even genocidal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it means that you haven't picked up </v>

907
00:57:47.381 --> 00:57:48.214
<v Speaker 4>enough responsibility because if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>picked up enough responsibility for the </v>

908
00:57:51.290 --> 00:57:55.420
<v Speaker 4>rejuvenation of the state and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>eradication of unnecessary suffering,</v>

909
00:57:55.570 --> 00:57:56.403
<v Speaker 4>you find enough meaning in that so the </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea of meaninglessness would vanish in </v>

910
00:57:59.951 --> 00:58:00.784
<v Speaker 4>an instant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd have more meaning than you knew </v>

911
00:58:02.441 --> 00:58:05.110
<v Speaker 4>what to do with and that's a terrifying </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing as well,</v>

912
00:58:05.111 --> 00:58:05.944
<v Speaker 4>but to fight off one terrifying thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the specter of mortality and insanity </v>

913
00:58:10.690 --> 00:58:11.523
<v Speaker 4>and finitude and death,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need another monster of equivalent </v>

914
00:58:14.651 --> 00:58:15.484
<v Speaker 4>size and that's one that you can find </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's one that you can bear up and </v>

915
00:58:19.871 --> 00:58:20.704
<v Speaker 4>it's one that you can live and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>what we need to do because if we don't </v>

916
00:58:24.491 --> 00:58:29.470
<v Speaker 4>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then all hell breaks loose really,</v>

917
00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:33.640
<v Speaker 4>really eternally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what those stories mean.</v>

918
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:45.180
<v Speaker 4>Viewed in this light.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can understand postmodernism because</v>

919
00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:46.253
<v Speaker 4>postmodernism managers has a response.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a response to the NIETZSCHEAN </v>

920
00:58:49.561 --> 00:58:50.910
<v Speaker 4>dilemma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

921
00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:52.433
<v Speaker 4>The cornerstone of civilization has been</v>
<v Speaker 4>demolished by rational critique and no </v>

922
00:58:56.401 --> 00:58:57.234
<v Speaker 4>wonder it needed to be criticized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it needed to be more deeply </v>

923
00:58:59.281 --> 00:59:00.114
<v Speaker 4>understood and criticism and deep </v>
<v Speaker 4>understanding are the same thing unless </v>

924
00:59:03.631 --> 00:59:07.290
<v Speaker 4>the criticism is only destruction </v>
<v Speaker 4>because if you criticize something,</v>

925
00:59:07.291 --> 00:59:09.510
<v Speaker 4>what you're doing is separating the </v>
<v Speaker 4>wheat from the chaff.</v>

926
00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:11.460
<v Speaker 4>You're not burning all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're saying,</v>

927
00:59:11.461 --> 00:59:12.181
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not this,</v>

928
00:59:12.181 --> 00:59:14.010
<v Speaker 4>not this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but definitely this.</v>

929
00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:17.010
<v Speaker 4>Definitely this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's what education should provide</v>

930
00:59:17.011 --> 00:59:17.844
<v Speaker 4>you with the opportunity to do as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What should we conserve and what should </v>

931
00:59:20.551 --> 00:59:23.300
<v Speaker 4>we dispense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we can serve,</v>

932
00:59:23.301 --> 00:59:25.670
<v Speaker 4>what centrally true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and now we need to understand it.</v>

933
00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:26.533
<v Speaker 4>We have to conserve the idea that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual has an infinite </v>

934
00:59:29.271 --> 00:59:30.104
<v Speaker 4>responsibility to the direction of being</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we know that you know perfectly </v>

935
00:59:34.101 --> 00:59:34.934
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you live in a relationship with </v>

936
00:59:35.601 --> 00:59:38.660
<v Speaker 4>your own conscience and when you violate</v>
<v Speaker 4>the moral order,</v>

937
00:59:38.661 --> 00:59:40.910
<v Speaker 4>that's part and parcel of your soul.</v>

938
00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:44.810
<v Speaker 4>You're ashamed and hide and bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you get angry.</v>

939
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:46.700
<v Speaker 4>You can't show your face to other </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

940
00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:49.940
<v Speaker 4>You can't even look at yourself in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mirror and you know perfectly well.</v>

941
00:59:49.941 --> 00:59:50.774
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even though you may not know what to do </v>

942
00:59:52.431 --> 00:59:53.264
<v Speaker 4>about it or how to get out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's there's a moral order built into </v>

943
00:59:56.901 --> 00:59:59.570
<v Speaker 4>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there wasn't,</v>

944
00:59:59.571 --> 01:00:00.404
<v Speaker 4>there was no way we could even </v>
<v Speaker 4>communicate with one another because </v>

945
01:00:01.881 --> 01:00:02.714
<v Speaker 4>there'd be no rules of communication.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There'd be nothing that we mutually </v>

946
01:00:05.151 --> 01:00:07.370
<v Speaker 4>wanted or expected from each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

947
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:08.263
<v Speaker 4>one of the things I figured out is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're all appalled when we run into </v>

948
01:00:11.961 --> 01:00:15.290
<v Speaker 4>another person who is not yet the </v>
<v Speaker 4>redeemer.</v>

949
01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:17.293
<v Speaker 4>Every person you ever meet your you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>dissatisfied with because they're not </v>

950
01:00:20.631 --> 01:00:21.464
<v Speaker 4>who they could be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're broadcasting that message at </v>

951
01:00:23.121 --> 01:00:25.280
<v Speaker 4>everyone all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not who you could be.</v>

952
01:00:25.281 --> 01:00:27.650
<v Speaker 4>You're not who you could be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not who you could be.</v>

953
01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:28.573
<v Speaker 4>I'm not who I could be and we're all </v>
<v Speaker 4>facing each other with our emotional </v>

954
01:00:32.781 --> 01:00:33.614
<v Speaker 4>displays,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pleading with each other to become that </v>

955
01:00:36.591 --> 01:00:40.960
<v Speaker 4>which we could become</v>
<v Speaker 4>and everyone knows it,</v>

956
01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:44.470
<v Speaker 4>but we won't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's no wonder</v>

957
01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:51.310
<v Speaker 4>the postmodernists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're the.</v>

958
01:00:51.490 --> 01:00:54.400
<v Speaker 4>They're the logical conclusion of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Nietzschean dilemma.</v>

959
01:00:55.690 --> 01:00:59.560
<v Speaker 4>God is dead value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The value structure collapsed.</v>

960
01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:04.090
<v Speaker 4>The specter of rises of all value </v>
<v Speaker 4>structures collapsing.</v>

961
01:01:04.930 --> 01:01:08.830
<v Speaker 4>That's the postmodernists dogma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All value structures have collapsed.</v>

962
01:01:09.250 --> 01:01:11.980
<v Speaker 4>They're only there for the purposes of </v>
<v Speaker 4>exclusion.</v>

963
01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:15.040
<v Speaker 4>They have no intrinsic value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very,</v>

964
01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:15.933
<v Speaker 4>very powerful argument.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why it dominates the </v>

965
01:01:18.881 --> 01:01:19.714
<v Speaker 4>universities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That and the fact that it allows people </v>

966
01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:24.640
<v Speaker 4>to dispense with their moral </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsibility,</v>

967
01:01:24.790 --> 01:01:27.670
<v Speaker 4>which is something that's never </v>
<v Speaker 4>discussed by the postmodernist,</v>

968
01:01:28.030 --> 01:01:30.100
<v Speaker 4>but you have to give the devil his due.</v>

969
01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:36.320
<v Speaker 4>What's the problem with postmodernism?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

970
01:01:36.321 --> 01:01:37.154
<v Speaker 4>if all value structures have collapsed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then there's nothing to do because in </v>

971
01:01:41.571 --> 01:01:42.404
<v Speaker 4>order to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one thing has to be better than another </v>

972
01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.433
<v Speaker 4>because otherwise why do it and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>people who are ensconced in the </v>

973
01:01:49.011 --> 01:01:53.420
<v Speaker 4>postmodern tradition are undermined by </v>
<v Speaker 4>their own philosophy.</v>

974
01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:56.930
<v Speaker 4>They can deconstruct their own </v>
<v Speaker 4>deconstruction,</v>

975
01:01:57.170 --> 01:01:58.003
<v Speaker 4>in which case they might as well just </v>
<v Speaker 4>sit there and do nothing which would </v>

976
01:02:00.651 --> 01:02:02.660
<v Speaker 4>actually be preferable to what they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing now.</v>

977
01:02:06.330 --> 01:02:09.560
<v Speaker 4>So how do they extract themselves from </v>
<v Speaker 4>that dilemma?</v>

978
01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:11.673
<v Speaker 4>They do ideologically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they don't care because the </v>

979
01:02:14.421 --> 01:02:17.450
<v Speaker 4>postmodernists first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't believe in logic.</v>

980
01:02:17.451 --> 01:02:21.720
<v Speaker 4>That's a reflection of the logos they've</v>
<v Speaker 4>dispensed with dialogue.</v>

981
01:02:21.721 --> 01:02:22.554
<v Speaker 4>They don't believe that because that's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>reflection of the logos which they've </v>

982
01:02:24.781 --> 01:02:28.200
<v Speaker 4>dispensed with logic and dialogue are </v>
<v Speaker 4>irrelevant.</v>

983
01:02:28.590 --> 01:02:29.423
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that does bring up the problem of what </v>

984
01:02:30.601 --> 01:02:31.710
<v Speaker 4>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

985
01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:32.553
<v Speaker 4>there's postmodernist finesse that by </v>
<v Speaker 4>reverting to the Marxist doctrines from </v>

986
01:02:36.421 --> 01:02:39.300
<v Speaker 4>which postmodernism emerged,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so they say,</v>

987
01:02:39.301 --> 01:02:40.230
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

988
01:02:40.231 --> 01:02:42.630
<v Speaker 4>you can't get any direction from </v>
<v Speaker 4>postmodernism,</v>

989
01:02:42.631 --> 01:02:43.590
<v Speaker 4>but we don't.</v>

990
01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:44.873
<v Speaker 4>We're not going to worry about that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we don't worry about such </v>

991
01:02:46.171 --> 01:02:49.770
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What we'll do is just use slight of hand</v>

992
01:02:49.771 --> 01:02:50.604
<v Speaker 4>to push forward the communitarian </v>
<v Speaker 4>doctrines out of which our original </v>

993
01:02:54.211 --> 01:02:57.030
<v Speaker 4>hypothesis emerged and everyone says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

994
01:02:57.031 --> 01:03:01.380
<v Speaker 4>we'll turn a blind eye to the paradox </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we actually need something to do</v>

995
01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:03.960
<v Speaker 4>and plus to the degree that we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>communitarian,</v>

996
01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:04.943
<v Speaker 4>we can take out our nihilistic </v>
<v Speaker 4>resentment and arrogance and in </v>

997
01:03:08.341 --> 01:03:09.174
<v Speaker 4>gratitude on every single person we </v>
<v Speaker 4>deemed to have something more than we </v>

998
01:03:12.781 --> 01:03:13.614
<v Speaker 4>have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so if you're wondering why certain </v>

999
01:03:17.281 --> 01:03:20.850
<v Speaker 4>values can exist in the absence of any </v>
<v Speaker 4>value,</v>

1000
01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:25.530
<v Speaker 4>you have to look no farther than to </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand that people who are desperate</v>

1001
01:03:25.531 --> 01:03:26.364
<v Speaker 4>and chaotic will still be angry and </v>
<v Speaker 4>destructive and they can manifest that </v>

1002
01:03:30.721 --> 01:03:33.600
<v Speaker 4>perfectly with the moral mask that says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1003
01:03:33.601 --> 01:03:37.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm not really after what you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you have a little more than me.</v>

1004
01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:40.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm speaking on behalf of these people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who have even less.</v>

1005
01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:41.993
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's absolute nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so funny watching Yale students </v>

1006
01:03:46.441 --> 01:03:50.100
<v Speaker 4>complain about the privileged.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're in the top,</v>

1007
01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:55.110
<v Speaker 4>one 10th of 100th of a percent of people</v>
<v Speaker 4>who've lived in in the entire history of</v>

1008
01:03:55.111 --> 01:03:55.944
<v Speaker 4>the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>much less just the people that are on </v>

1009
01:03:57.631 --> 01:03:58.464
<v Speaker 4>the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now they're dominating patriarchs in </v>

1010
01:04:01.441 --> 01:04:03.150
<v Speaker 4>training,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right there,</v>

1011
01:04:03.151 --> 01:04:03.984
<v Speaker 4>baby representatives of the Patriarchy </v>
<v Speaker 4>and all they do is complain about that </v>

1012
01:04:07.891 --> 01:04:08.970
<v Speaker 4>tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tiny,</v>

1013
01:04:08.971 --> 01:04:13.800
<v Speaker 4>infinitesimal fraction of people who </v>
<v Speaker 4>have slightly more than they have now.</v>

1014
01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:19.290
<v Speaker 4>It's appalling and their idiot </v>
<v Speaker 4>professors pat them on the back and send</v>

1015
01:04:19.291 --> 01:04:23.550
<v Speaker 4>them out the world to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Instead of teaching them how to live,</v>

1016
01:04:24.090 --> 01:04:26.450
<v Speaker 4>they damaged their mental health.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They they,</v>

1017
01:04:26.550 --> 01:04:27.383
<v Speaker 4>they heard our society,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're bringing things down and that's </v>

1018
01:04:30.721 --> 01:04:31.554
<v Speaker 4>what they're aiming at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The postmodernist managed to be </v>

1019
01:04:36.930 --> 01:04:41.460
<v Speaker 4>nihilistic and totalitarian at the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>

1020
01:04:41.790 --> 01:04:42.623
<v Speaker 4>which is something that not even need </v>
<v Speaker 4>should dreamed about despite the fact </v>

1021
01:04:45.391 --> 01:04:50.040
<v Speaker 4>that he had the greatest imagination for</v>
<v Speaker 4>pathology that perhaps ever existed.</v>

1022
01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:51.323
<v Speaker 4>In addition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they combine the nihilism and </v>

1023
01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:54.473
<v Speaker 4>totalitarianism with the worst aspects </v>
<v Speaker 4>of dogmatic religion because what </v>

1024
01:04:58.621 --> 01:04:59.454
<v Speaker 4>they've essentially established is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>cult into which children who attend </v>

1025
01:05:03.361 --> 01:05:07.020
<v Speaker 4>university are now indoctrinated at </v>
<v Speaker 4>great cost,</v>

1026
01:05:07.021 --> 01:05:10.110
<v Speaker 4>I might add and with very little </v>
<v Speaker 4>practical outcome,</v>

1027
01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:18.350
<v Speaker 4>what's the alternative given that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a point as far as I can tell,</v>

1028
01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:22.660
<v Speaker 4>the alternative is a proper return to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the past,</v>

1029
01:05:22.661 --> 01:05:25.720
<v Speaker 4>and that is precisely to journey into </v>
<v Speaker 4>the chaos,</v>

1030
01:05:25.721 --> 01:05:26.554
<v Speaker 4>to look at the worst possible thing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>to pull the dead father up from the </v>

1031
01:05:29.921 --> 01:05:33.190
<v Speaker 4>chaotic depths.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how you stop being a puppet.</v>

1032
01:05:34.270 --> 01:05:35.103
<v Speaker 4>Someone whose strings are being pulled </v>
<v Speaker 4>by forces they do not understand behind </v>

1033
01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:39.334
<v Speaker 4>the scenes,</v>

1034
01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:45.600
<v Speaker 4>you find out what's great about your </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture is thing that's provided us with</v>

1035
01:05:45.601 --> 01:05:46.434
<v Speaker 4>everything that we see in this room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this amazing warmth that we're </v>

1036
01:05:49.051 --> 01:05:53.160
<v Speaker 4>experiencing when it's 30 bloody below </v>
<v Speaker 4>outside the fact that the electricity or</v>

1037
01:05:53.161 --> 01:05:55.860
<v Speaker 4>the heart and the computational </v>
<v Speaker 4>resources are working in that we can all</v>

1038
01:05:55.861 --> 01:05:58.230
<v Speaker 4>sit here peacefully and then no one is </v>
<v Speaker 4>hungry.</v>

1039
01:05:58.410 --> 01:05:59.730
<v Speaker 4>Fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're too fat.</v>

1040
01:05:59.910 --> 01:06:02.100
<v Speaker 4>That's our big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh No,</v>

1041
01:06:02.730 --> 01:06:05.040
<v Speaker 4>we have so much stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're getting fat.</v>

1042
01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:07.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's a good problem to have.</v>

1043
01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:12.300
<v Speaker 4>We should have some gratitude for what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>being produced that's brought us to this</v>

1044
01:06:12.301 --> 01:06:15.720
<v Speaker 4>point and we need to wake up and </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand what we're doing.</v>

1045
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.823
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what.</v>

1046
01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:17.753
<v Speaker 4>That's what people like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what the psychoanalysts were </v>

1047
01:06:19.651 --> 01:06:20.484
<v Speaker 4>trying to do in the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what all the great clinicians </v>

1048
01:06:22.471 --> 01:06:23.304
<v Speaker 4>we're trying to do and I would say above</v>
<v Speaker 4>all else that was what Carl young was </v>

1049
01:06:26.191 --> 01:06:27.024
<v Speaker 4>trying to do.</v>

1050
01:06:27.330 --> 01:06:28.163
<v Speaker 4>He believed firmly that the idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>divine spark within the individual was </v>

1051
01:06:32.311 --> 01:06:33.144
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was a metaphysical reality by which he </v>

1052
01:06:35.161 --> 01:06:35.994
<v Speaker 4>meant a reality that actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>transcended and existed super to the </v>

1053
01:06:41.041 --> 01:06:41.874
<v Speaker 4>physical reality of more real reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's whatever consciousness is </v>

1054
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:48.600
<v Speaker 4>something we understand from a </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientific perspective,</v>

1055
01:06:48.690 --> 01:06:49.523
<v Speaker 4>not at all that's been represented in </v>
<v Speaker 4>our mythologies as far back as we can </v>

1056
01:06:54.301 --> 01:06:57.750
<v Speaker 4>push them as an independent agent in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>

1057
01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:01.890
<v Speaker 4>giving rise to form.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how we treat each other.</v>

1058
01:07:01.891 --> 01:07:06.270
<v Speaker 4>That's how we recognize ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how we judge each other.</v>

1059
01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:11.640
<v Speaker 4>You make your bed and then you lie in it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and everyone knows it,</v>

1060
01:07:11.641 --> 01:07:12.474
<v Speaker 4>and that's not to say that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>subject to random and chaotic </v>

1061
01:07:14.971 --> 01:07:15.804
<v Speaker 4>circumstances and the tragedy of life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just because you can do some things </v>

1062
01:07:19.201 --> 01:07:20.034
<v Speaker 4>doesn't mean you can do everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can do some things and if you </v>

1063
01:07:23.641 --> 01:07:24.474
<v Speaker 4>don't do them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then things fall apart and the problem </v>

1064
01:07:27.571 --> 01:07:28.404
<v Speaker 4>with things falling apart is that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>will be happy about it to the degree </v>

1065
01:07:31.111 --> 01:07:31.944
<v Speaker 4>that you're not trying to repair them </v>
<v Speaker 4>because to the degree that you do not </v>

1066
01:07:34.891 --> 01:07:35.724
<v Speaker 4>manifest what's within you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then your life falls apart around you </v>

1067
01:07:39.330 --> 01:07:40.163
<v Speaker 4>and everything that could make you </v>
<v Speaker 4>bitter multiplies until you're in a </v>

1068
01:07:42.631 --> 01:07:44.790
<v Speaker 4>situation where you want the </v>
<v Speaker 4>destruction.</v>

1069
01:07:44.790 --> 01:07:47.940
<v Speaker 4>You want to bring it on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's not surprising</v>

1070
01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:50.523
<v Speaker 4>because life can be so terrible that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>question of whether or not it should </v>

1071
01:07:52.721 --> 01:07:53.554
<v Speaker 4>exist at all can be a real question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the answer to that is his life so </v>

1072
01:07:58.541 --> 01:08:01.390
<v Speaker 4>terrible that it shouldn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1073
01:08:01.391 --> 01:08:02.224
<v Speaker 4>the answer is it depends on how you live</v>
<v Speaker 4>it and if your life is so terrible that </v>

1074
01:08:07.121 --> 01:08:07.954
<v Speaker 4>you can't bear it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it raises the question of whether </v>

1075
01:08:09.851 --> 01:08:10.684
<v Speaker 4>or not you're living it properly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's not to say that people don't </v>

1076
01:08:13.810 --> 01:08:17.630
<v Speaker 4>suffer under burdens that are too great </v>
<v Speaker 4>for them to bear.</v>

1077
01:08:17.631 --> 01:08:18.464
<v Speaker 4>They certainly do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter because if you let </v>

1078
01:08:21.681 --> 01:08:22.514
<v Speaker 4>that embitter you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you let that destroy your allegiance </v>

1079
01:08:25.341 --> 01:08:26.174
<v Speaker 4>to the proper path,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all it does is make that worse and </v>

1080
01:08:28.611 --> 01:08:31.040
<v Speaker 4>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's no out.</v>

1081
01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:44.453
<v Speaker 4>So what did I learn from studying</v>
<v Speaker 4>from studying the terrible situation </v>

1082
01:08:50.131 --> 01:08:50.964
<v Speaker 4>that obtained in the mid 19 eighties </v>
<v Speaker 4>when the Soviets and the West had tens </v>

1083
01:08:57.330 --> 01:09:01.050
<v Speaker 4>of thousands of hydrogen bombs pointed </v>
<v Speaker 4>at each other,</v>

1084
01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:05.280
<v Speaker 4>ready to go at a moment's notice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why did that happen?</v>

1085
01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:07.470
<v Speaker 4>What did I learn?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was simple.</v>

1086
01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:13.760
<v Speaker 4>The reason that that situation existed </v>
<v Speaker 4>was because I was not good enough.</v>

1087
01:09:15.690 --> 01:09:16.523
<v Speaker 4>I was not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason that the terrible situations </v>

1088
01:09:19.261 --> 01:09:22.230
<v Speaker 4>in the world exists now is because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not good enough.</v>

1089
01:09:22.290 --> 01:09:24.840
<v Speaker 4>You're not good enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not good enough.</v>

1090
01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:29.070
<v Speaker 4>We could solve any problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can solve any problem.</v>

1091
01:09:29.071 --> 01:09:31.500
<v Speaker 4>If we used all the resources that were </v>
<v Speaker 4>available to us,</v>

1092
01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:34.590
<v Speaker 4>if we live properly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have no idea what we could turn,</v>

1093
01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:39.300
<v Speaker 4>what were in into,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I would say</v>

1094
01:09:42.490 --> 01:09:43.323
<v Speaker 4>you support free speech because it's the</v>
<v Speaker 4>mechanism that maintains the sanity of </v>

1095
01:09:49.241 --> 01:09:54.241
<v Speaker 4>the individual and society and you live </v>
<v Speaker 4>in relationship with the spoken truth to</v>

1096
01:09:56.951 --> 01:10:00.700
<v Speaker 4>the best of your ability because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>alternative is hell,</v>

1097
01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:02.373
<v Speaker 4>and if hell is what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can remain arrogant and </v>

1098
01:10:06.131 --> 01:10:06.964
<v Speaker 4>resentful and deceitful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you want to work to better the </v>

1099
01:10:09.311 --> 01:10:11.500
<v Speaker 4>world to bring it up to what it might </v>
<v Speaker 4>be,</v>

1100
01:10:12.490 --> 01:10:13.323
<v Speaker 4>then you speak forthrightly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You clarify yourself and you act </v>

1101
01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:21.910
<v Speaker 4>properly in the world and then you see </v>
<v Speaker 4>what happens,</v>

1102
01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:23.253
<v Speaker 4>and this is the final thing I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I spent a long time studying the sermon </v>

1103
01:10:26.741 --> 01:10:29.080
<v Speaker 4>on the mount.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a key document.</v>

1104
01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:33.880
<v Speaker 4>It's Christ's commentary on the Ten </v>
<v Speaker 4>Commandments.</v>

1105
01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:36.400
<v Speaker 4>In a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the question being,</v>

1106
01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:40.060
<v Speaker 4>if you codify the rules by which a </v>
<v Speaker 4>society might function,</v>

1107
01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:41.103
<v Speaker 4>is there something within the structure </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the rules that rises above them that </v>

1108
01:10:44.561 --> 01:10:47.830
<v Speaker 4>acts as the fundamental principle from </v>
<v Speaker 4>which they're all derived?</v>

1109
01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:50.470
<v Speaker 4>It's the ultimate question of human </v>
<v Speaker 4>ethics.</v>

1110
01:10:50.710 --> 01:10:55.000
<v Speaker 4>What is the highest principle and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>answer that's put forth in the sermon on</v>

1111
01:10:55.001 --> 01:10:55.834
<v Speaker 4>the mount is quite straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Aim at the highest possible good that </v>

1112
01:10:59.441 --> 01:11:00.274
<v Speaker 4>you can conceive of whatever that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can conceive of that serves as </v>

1113
01:11:04.001 --> 01:11:06.460
<v Speaker 4>your God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For all intents and purposes,</v>

1114
01:11:07.330 --> 01:11:12.330
<v Speaker 4>having aligned yourself with that good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>speak the truth and see what happens.</v>

1115
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:15.623
<v Speaker 4>That's the act of faith.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The act of faith is whatever the truth </v>

1116
01:11:20.131 --> 01:11:22.560
<v Speaker 4>reveals is the best of all possible </v>
<v Speaker 4>worlds.</v>

1117
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:27.000
<v Speaker 4>Regardless of how it appears to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now it's a guess,</v>

1118
01:11:27.001 --> 01:11:27.480
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a.</v>

1119
01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:30.450
<v Speaker 4>it's something you stake a bat on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1120
01:11:30.451 --> 01:11:34.290
<v Speaker 4>what do you think the best of all </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible worlds will be brought into?</v>

1121
01:11:34.291 --> 01:11:37.380
<v Speaker 4>Being by deceit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems unlikely.</v>

1122
01:11:37.381 --> 01:11:39.060
<v Speaker 4>You know that doesn't work in your own </v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

1123
01:11:39.061 --> 01:11:41.490
<v Speaker 4>You Tangle yourself up in your own lies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1124
01:11:41.490 --> 01:11:42.323
<v Speaker 4>One lie breeds Tandon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 breeds a hundred and maybe you put </v>

1125
01:11:45.031 --> 01:11:45.864
<v Speaker 4>the consequences on down the road and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't fall into the pit for five or </v>

1126
01:11:48.391 --> 01:11:50.820
<v Speaker 4>six years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you've even forgotten why you fell</v>

1127
01:11:50.821 --> 01:11:53.700
<v Speaker 4>in when you finally do fall in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but everyone knows that.</v>

1128
01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:58.820
<v Speaker 4>Everyone knows that you don't get away </v>
<v Speaker 4>with anything and so the issue is,</v>

1129
01:11:59.191 --> 01:12:00.024
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would happen if you just said what </v>

01:12:01.891 --> 01:12:05.040
<v Speaker 4>you thought stupid as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>inaccurate as it is,</v>

1131
01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:05.993
<v Speaker 4>and listen to people criticize you in </v>
<v Speaker 4>response to shape you and make you more </v>

1132
01:12:09.301 --> 01:12:10.134
<v Speaker 4>articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would your life be like and </v>

1133
01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:12.423

<v Speaker 4>That is,</v>

1134
01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:15.270

<v Speaker 4>I've worked with many,</v>

1136
01:12:20.311 --> 01:12:21.144
<v Speaker 4>better and richer and deeper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that comes with a heavier and </v>

1137
01:12:25.261 --> 01:12:27.870
<v Speaker 4>heavier burden of responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

01:12:27.871 --> 01:12:28.704
<v Speaker 4>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You use the observation of your own </v>

1139
01:12:31.111 --> 01:12:36.111
<v Speaker 4>capability to bear responsibility to </v>
<v Speaker 4>buttress yourself against the terrorists</v>

1140
01:12:36.601 --> 01:12:38.820
<v Speaker 4>of being finite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You say,</v>

1141
01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:40.943
<v Speaker 4>we can miserable as I am.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can still stand up to the terrible </v>

<v Speaker 4>tragedy of life and prevail and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>good enough.</v>
