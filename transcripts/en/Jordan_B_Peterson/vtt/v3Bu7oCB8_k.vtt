10
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go there.</v>

11
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alright.</v>

12
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.600
<v Speaker 1>I should welcome my extension school</v>

13
00:01:31.601 --> 00:01:34.200
<v Speaker 1>We'll be looking at this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

14
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.180
<v Speaker 1>If you turn to the back of the syllabus</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it says two calendar of events,</v>

15
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.020
<v Speaker 1>the titles that are listed on the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand side are all chapters from the</v>

16
00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:44.850
<v Speaker 1>coursebook that sap?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No moon coffee.</v>

17
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:45.743
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

18
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.520
<v Speaker 1>And then if you look at reading list and</v>
<v Speaker 1>due dates,</v>

19
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.880
<v Speaker 1>so is it agile readings?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are all books that are responsive</v>

20
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.350
<v Speaker 1>to this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is for weeks one to three or books</v>

21
00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:01.460
<v Speaker 1>that are available at the coop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

22
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.670
<v Speaker 1>And the address for noman coffee is 13</v>
<v Speaker 1>olds for Massachusetts Avenue.</v>

23
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:07.800
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as I said,</v>

24
00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:12.801
<v Speaker 1>there's a mixture of</v>
<v Speaker 1>analytical psychology texts that's</v>

25
00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:16.950
<v Speaker 1>basically young in psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some philosophy,</v>

26
00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:21.090
<v Speaker 1>some literature and some more</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychology and not basically covers</v>

27
00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:25.860
<v Speaker 1>the domain of the course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll start the introduction here.</v>

28
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a course about</v>

29
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.940
<v Speaker 1>the causes of social conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

30
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested in social conflict</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the perspective of a political</v>

31
00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:46.080
<v Speaker 1>scientist or a sociologist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested in intergroup conflict,</v>

32
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.560
<v Speaker 1>but not at the level of group analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested in what role social</v>

33
00:02:51.601 --> 00:02:56.340
<v Speaker 1>identity or group identity plays in</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual psychology and why it is that</v>

34
00:02:56.341 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>individuals are motivated to participate</v>
<v Speaker 1>in acts of conflict.</v>

35
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you using for an example here,</v>

36
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:07.210
<v Speaker 2>the Holocaust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking last week reading part of</v>

37
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 2>the preface to the book that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to read about the Holocaust museum</v>

38
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:13.600
<v Speaker 2>in Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of heads up,</v>

39
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:18.040
<v Speaker 2>obviously this is a museum to hope to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Jews primarily who were killed by</v>

40
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 2>the Nazis in World War Two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a number of museums like</v>

41
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:25.630
<v Speaker 2>this throughout the world and their</v>
<v Speaker 2>central model is never forget,</v>

42
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.870
<v Speaker 2>and this has always been confusing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

43
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 2>It's notion of never forgetting because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you can remember something</v>

44
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Speaker 2>that you don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think we understand why the</v>

45
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:41.170
<v Speaker 2>Holocaust happened in World War II.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

46
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.920
<v Speaker 2>I think you might regard the Holocaust</v>
<v Speaker 2>as none learned lesson and I don't think</v>

47
00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:51.420
<v Speaker 2>that you can process information you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't comprehend,</v>

48
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.660
<v Speaker 2>so we'll just say never forget things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is what is it that you're</v>

49
00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:57.230
<v Speaker 2>supposed to remember and use it?</v>

50
00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.200
<v Speaker 2>The fact that 6 million people were</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed,</v>

51
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.350
<v Speaker 2>does it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it the fact of that particular event</v>

52
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:06.250
<v Speaker 2>or are you supposed to be giving some</v>
<v Speaker 2>consideration to holocaust like events</v>

53
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:09.520
<v Speaker 2>that have occurred through history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are people who think that what</v>

54
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:12.220
<v Speaker 2>happened in World War II was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively unique event of something</v>

55
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:16.300
<v Speaker 2>unparalleled in history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not a position that I adopt.</v>

56
00:04:16.301 --> 00:04:19.420
<v Speaker 2>I think actually it's a very common sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of event.</v>

57
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.970
<v Speaker 2>It was perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the event of that sort that has</v>

58
00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:29.890
<v Speaker 2>proved most shocking to the European</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscience,</v>

59
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.980
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's hardly strikes me as unique and</v>

60
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.360
<v Speaker 2>people often talk about the Holocaust in</v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of the relationship between the</v>

61
00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:42.580
<v Speaker 2>Jews and the Germans are between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jews and the Nazis.</v>

62
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.200
<v Speaker 2>The Jews obviously playing the part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>victims and the Nazis often for always</v>

63
00:04:47.201 --> 00:04:49.570
<v Speaker 2>playing the part of the perpetrators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course this has absolutely</v>

64
00:04:49.571 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Speaker 2>comprehensible from the historical point</v>
<v Speaker 2>of view,</v>

65
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 2>but it also strikes me that if what we</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember is that the Nazis killed the</v>

66
00:04:56.141 --> 00:04:59.710
<v Speaker 2>Jews that were already on the road to</v>
<v Speaker 2>making a mistake that similar to the</v>

67
00:04:59.711 --> 00:05:04.120
<v Speaker 2>mistake that was made that led to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holocaust to begin with,</v>

68
00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:08.560
<v Speaker 2>which is to identify characteristics</v>
<v Speaker 2>that lead to patterns of action of that</v>

69
00:05:08.561 --> 00:05:12.970
<v Speaker 2>sort as characteristics of groups</v>
<v Speaker 2>identifiable groups.</v>

70
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.600
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm not trying to equate the role</v>

71
00:05:16.601 --> 00:05:19.390
<v Speaker 2>of the Jews and the Nazis and producing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Holocaust that would obviously be</v>

72
00:05:19.391 --> 00:05:22.240
<v Speaker 2>observed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm trying to say is that the</v>

73
00:05:22.241 --> 00:05:23.830
<v Speaker 2>last one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me to be,</v>

74
00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:28.831
<v Speaker 2>especially when you consider that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>propensity for home costs like events is</v>

75
00:05:29.561 --> 00:05:34.390
<v Speaker 2>deeply rooted in human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The lesson to draw from the events of</v>

76
00:05:34.391 --> 00:05:36.970
<v Speaker 2>World War II with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what human beings are like,</v>

77
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.650
<v Speaker 2>not what the Nazis were like because</v>
<v Speaker 2>these sorts of events happen all the</v>

78
00:05:41.651 --> 00:05:42.131
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

79
00:05:42.131 --> 00:05:46.480
<v Speaker 2>it's obviously the case that there are</v>
<v Speaker 2>well in the 20th century alone,</v>

80
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.550
<v Speaker 2>English and bent at the concentration</v>
<v Speaker 2>camp in South Africa,</v>

81
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.300
<v Speaker 2>Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her fact that Chinese used it to great</v>

82
00:05:55.301 --> 00:05:57.220
<v Speaker 2>advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Solzhenitsyn estimated,</v>

83
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.460
<v Speaker 2>I'll show this on the next slide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>66 million people in the Soviet Union</v>

84
00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:03.770
<v Speaker 2>were killed as a consequence of internal</v>
<v Speaker 2>repression,</v>

85
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.150
<v Speaker 2>many of whom went through camp like</v>
<v Speaker 2>procedures on their road to their</v>

86
00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:08.984
<v Speaker 2>demise.</v>

87
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.030
<v Speaker 2>See ethnic cleansing occurring in places</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Rwanda and even once again in</v>

88
00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Europe and the Balkans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was that we were supposed to</v>

89
00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.950
<v Speaker 2>learn from the events of the Second</v>
<v Speaker 2>World War hasn't been learned nor being</v>

90
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:24.740
<v Speaker 2>remembered because you can't remember</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you don't understand.</v>

91
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.010
<v Speaker 2>That's what this course is about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

92
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:33.250
<v Speaker 2>I've been working for since 1985 I guess</v>
<v Speaker 2>on trying to figure out what it is</v>

93
00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:34.730
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People</v>

94
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.720
<v Speaker 2>remember how to read that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you know this,</v>

95
00:06:38.721 --> 00:06:41.840
<v Speaker 2>maybe don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a famous political scientists.</v>

96
00:06:41.841 --> 00:06:44.870
<v Speaker 2>She was a student of Martin heidegger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wrote a book called the banality of</v>

97
00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:47.690
<v Speaker 2>evil and one of her points was that</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people,</v>

98
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.390
<v Speaker 2>she was talking about the Nazis in</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular,</v>

99
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.940
<v Speaker 2>people who perpetrate events like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you meet them,</v>

100
00:06:53.941 --> 00:06:56.360
<v Speaker 2>if you talk to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have encounter with them,</v>

101
00:06:56.361 --> 00:07:00.470
<v Speaker 2>the thing that's often striking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>them is not their striking abnormality</v>

102
00:07:00.471 --> 00:07:03.380
<v Speaker 2>or their evidence to eval,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that they're very much like</v>

103
00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:07.590
<v Speaker 2>other people that you might've met,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was suppose putting be surprises.</v>

104
00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.620
<v Speaker 2>So surprising when you think about how</v>
<v Speaker 2>thoroughly,</v>

105
00:07:09.621 --> 00:07:12.410
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Nazi movement dominated the German</v>

106
00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:15.650
<v Speaker 2>punches and sort of likewise with</v>
<v Speaker 2>communism in the Soviet Union.</v>

107
00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:18.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean those ideological movements</v>
<v Speaker 2>characterize people.</v>

108
00:07:18.741 --> 00:07:23.741
<v Speaker 2>They didn't characterize some strange</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of misfits whose consciousness was</v>

109
00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:28.730
<v Speaker 2>characterized by something in</v>
<v Speaker 2>comprehensible that led them to perform</v>

110
00:07:28.731 --> 00:07:31.220
<v Speaker 2>the kind of actions that we are</v>
<v Speaker 2>theoretically supposed to remember.</v>

111
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:37.060
<v Speaker 2>My perspective on all of the assistants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that people are capable of</v>

112
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:43.700
<v Speaker 2>perpetrating atrocities like those that</v>
<v Speaker 2>characterized the Holocaust.</v>

113
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.820
<v Speaker 2>It says something about what people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

114
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.320
<v Speaker 2>what everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's strikes me that that kind</v>

115
00:07:51.321 --> 00:07:54.740
<v Speaker 2>of tendency is something that's deeply</v>
<v Speaker 2>rooted in human nature and then to say</v>

116
00:07:54.741 --> 00:07:56.960
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what was it about the Nazis or what</v>

117
00:07:56.961 --> 00:08:00.890
<v Speaker 2>was it about the Soviet communists that</v>
<v Speaker 2>led them to participate in this sort of</v>

118
00:08:00.891 --> 00:08:03.950
<v Speaker 2>behavior is completely decided to point</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a sense.</v>

119
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.980
<v Speaker 2>All that does is you're looking for some</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of group characteristic.</v>

120
00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.550
<v Speaker 2>It's devoid and you don't have any</v>
<v Speaker 2>personal relationship with that group.</v>

121
00:08:10.551 --> 00:08:13.580
<v Speaker 2>The problem is instantly made abstract</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as far as I'm concerned,</v>

122
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.860
<v Speaker 2>if it's abstract,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then once again,</v>

123
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:20.720
<v Speaker 2>nothing is remembered and what I want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do is to try to,</v>

124
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:25.500
<v Speaker 2>I want to outline the reasons why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like the whole,</v>

125
00:08:25.501 --> 00:08:29.540
<v Speaker 2>the costs incurred,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it is about us that make us so</v>

126
00:08:29.541 --> 00:08:31.760
<v Speaker 2>concerned with protecting our group</v>
<v Speaker 2>identities,</v>

127
00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:35.990
<v Speaker 2>what those identities mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what role they play in the regulation of</v>

128
00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:37.970
<v Speaker 2>emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the critical thing right there</v>

129
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.150
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>idiot ologies are,</v>

130
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.700
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are the expression in a sense,</v>

131
00:08:43.701 --> 00:08:48.350
<v Speaker 2>the verbal expression of the internal</v>
<v Speaker 2>structures that regulate our emotions.</v>

132
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.480
<v Speaker 2>When you mess around with someone's</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideologies.</v>

133
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.300
<v Speaker 2>Therefore as a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're messing around with the</v>

134
00:08:53.301 --> 00:08:56.760
<v Speaker 2>inhibitory structure that regulates the</v>
<v Speaker 2>interplay between their emotions.</v>

135
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:01.110
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to study in part in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>course of what emotions are and how</v>

136
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:04.380
<v Speaker 2>they're rooted in neuropsychology and</v>
<v Speaker 2>neurophysiology and how they manifest</v>

137
00:09:04.381 --> 00:09:07.440
<v Speaker 2>themselves and behavior and how they</v>
<v Speaker 2>might be controlled and how that might</v>

138
00:09:07.441 --> 00:09:11.190
<v Speaker 2>tie into something as abstract as social</v>
<v Speaker 2>identity.</v>

139
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:16.370
<v Speaker 2>Usually there's no question that a link</v>
<v Speaker 2>made between the concept of sociological</v>

140
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.000
<v Speaker 2>processes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

141
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.390
<v Speaker 2>and inter psychic processes or</v>
<v Speaker 2>neuropsychological structures,</v>

142
00:09:21.391 --> 00:09:23.820
<v Speaker 2>but it's obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think about it for a moment that</v>

143
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:29.030
<v Speaker 2>whatever your identity is plays some</v>
<v Speaker 2>role in regulating your emotional nature</v>

144
00:09:30.181 --> 00:09:33.960
<v Speaker 2>and your of your physiology because your</v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts are embodied.</v>

145
00:09:33.961 --> 00:09:35.960
<v Speaker 2>They're part of your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're part of your brain.</v>

146
00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:40.500
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to get right down to it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have belief systems and they'll</v>

147
00:09:40.501 --> 00:09:45.330
<v Speaker 2>do anything to protect and I find that</v>
<v Speaker 2>peculiar is what is it that's so</v>

148
00:09:45.331 --> 00:09:48.180
<v Speaker 2>important about belief system that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>lead people to do things.</v>

149
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:52.560
<v Speaker 2>Normal people as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to commit acts that under normal</v>

150
00:09:52.561 --> 00:09:57.561
<v Speaker 2>circumstances would would be conceived</v>
<v Speaker 2>of as incomprehensible even by those</v>

151
00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:02.310
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I also hope to make,</v>

152
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:06.360
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to make the lessons here</v>

153
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:10.290
<v Speaker 2>personal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not interested in discussing the</v>

154
00:10:10.291 --> 00:10:14.300
<v Speaker 2>issue from the abstract perspective</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't think that an issue,</v>

155
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.760
<v Speaker 2>an issue of this magnitude deserves to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be discussed.</v>

156
00:10:17.761 --> 00:10:22.560
<v Speaker 2>Data at an abstract level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not an abstract problem.</v>

157
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:26.340
<v Speaker 2>It's something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something peculiar about us that</v>

158
00:10:26.341 --> 00:10:29.370
<v Speaker 2>we have to learn to control because as</v>
<v Speaker 2>far as I'm concerned,</v>

159
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:34.020
<v Speaker 2>we're to the technologically powerful to</v>
<v Speaker 2>remain at the whims of the</v>

160
00:10:34.021 --> 00:10:39.021
<v Speaker 2>uncomprehending aspects of our nature</v>
<v Speaker 2>piece,</v>

161
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:43.020
<v Speaker 2>predictability and the delusion of self</v>
<v Speaker 2>representation.</v>

162
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.430
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

163
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.670
<v Speaker 2>if you can predict something as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>general rule,</v>

164
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:56.030
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to determine why it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you think you understand something</v>

165
00:10:57.751 --> 00:10:58.800
<v Speaker 2>when you think you do.</v>

166
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.190
<v Speaker 2>If you think about it for a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets complicated because you're</v>

167
00:11:02.191 --> 00:11:05.850
<v Speaker 2>surrounded by things that at some level</v>
<v Speaker 2>of analysis,</v>

168
00:11:05.851 --> 00:11:09.180
<v Speaker 2>you cease to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter what what phenomenon</v>

169
00:11:09.181 --> 00:11:12.810
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even even the most mundane objects</v>

170
00:11:12.811 --> 00:11:15.120
<v Speaker 2>become mysterious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look into them foreign,</v>

171
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.450
<v Speaker 2>take something as simple as a chairs</v>
<v Speaker 2>made out of wood.</v>

172
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:22.440
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing remarkable about that.</v>

173
00:11:22.441 --> 00:11:24.650
<v Speaker 2>But if you start to look into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>structure that wouldn't count.</v>

174
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:28.470
<v Speaker 2>Organism Mitre produced it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of the chemical reactions that go</v>

175
00:11:28.471 --> 00:11:31.770
<v Speaker 2>about bringing that about and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>developmental history that led to the,</v>

176
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:37.020
<v Speaker 2>to the emergence of plants and trees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it can see that even in something</v>

177
00:11:37.021 --> 00:11:39.060
<v Speaker 2>mundane or and banded all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>mysteries.</v>

178
00:11:39.061 --> 00:11:41.820
<v Speaker 2>But for the large part we traded show</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

179
00:11:41.821 --> 00:11:45.420
<v Speaker 2>We understand well that's in part</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're only concerned with it</v>

180
00:11:45.421 --> 00:11:48.060
<v Speaker 2>with regards to its function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it serves the function of being</v>

181
00:11:48.061 --> 00:11:50.820
<v Speaker 2>able to be sat upon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we don't pay any more attention to</v>

182
00:11:50.821 --> 00:11:54.250
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we think that if we can predict the</v>

183
00:11:54.251 --> 00:11:55.930
<v Speaker 2>behavior or something that we understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

184
00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:59.860
<v Speaker 2>So in peace when we observe ourselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>acting peacefully,</v>

185
00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:02.410
<v Speaker 2>we presume that we'd got ourselves under</v>
<v Speaker 2>control,</v>

186
00:12:02.411 --> 00:12:06.070
<v Speaker 2>that we actually do understand about</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other because we can predict the</v>

187
00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:08.100
<v Speaker 2>behavior of others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we can predict their own behavior.</v>

188
00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.770
<v Speaker 2>Now deludes us into thinking best</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore our models of ourselves or</v>

189
00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:15.850
<v Speaker 2>actual actually accurate representations</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what we're like,</v>

190
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:17.830
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

191
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:21.490
<v Speaker 2>the problem is in wartime we don't act</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we do in times of peace,</v>

192
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:25.920
<v Speaker 2>but then of course during war time when</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are committing violent or</v>

193
00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.850
<v Speaker 2>socially aggressive acts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't really have all that much</v>

194
00:12:27.851 --> 00:12:31.240
<v Speaker 2>time to sit around and self reflect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not a time to be to be building</v>

195
00:12:31.241 --> 00:12:34.990
<v Speaker 2>models about who it is that you are and</v>
<v Speaker 2>why it is that you're that way you're</v>

196
00:12:34.991 --> 00:12:38.410
<v Speaker 2>too busy doing whatever it is that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen to be involved in to protect your</v>

197
00:12:38.411 --> 00:12:41.830
<v Speaker 2>territory or to take someone else's</v>
<v Speaker 2>territory or two to expand your</v>

198
00:12:41.831 --> 00:12:46.420
<v Speaker 2>ecological dominion or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peaceful Times.</v>

199
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:49.520
<v Speaker 2>We look at ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we see ourselves being peacefully</v>

200
00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:52.720
<v Speaker 2>they bleed and nice name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who make the precept position that as a</v>

201
00:12:52.721 --> 00:12:54.730
<v Speaker 2>consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we're like and that we also</v>

202
00:12:54.731 --> 00:12:58.480
<v Speaker 2>understand herself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a big mistake because if you put</v>

203
00:12:58.481 --> 00:13:02.290
<v Speaker 2>someone under extreme circumstances then</v>
<v Speaker 2>there will be things about them that</v>

204
00:13:02.291 --> 00:13:05.740
<v Speaker 2>will be revealed to them that can only</v>
<v Speaker 2>be revealed under extreme circumstances</v>

205
00:13:05.741 --> 00:13:10.741
<v Speaker 2>and it's extreme circumstances that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned about in the course of this</v>

206
00:13:12.311 --> 00:13:12.820
<v Speaker 2>course.</v>

207
00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:16.780
<v Speaker 2>I want to find out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that one of the things that</v>

208
00:13:16.781 --> 00:13:19.090
<v Speaker 2>ideology does a group identity for that</v>
<v Speaker 2>matters,</v>

209
00:13:19.091 --> 00:13:23.140
<v Speaker 2>regulating our emotions and if you're a</v>
<v Speaker 2>member of a community that has a</v>

210
00:13:23.141 --> 00:13:27.250
<v Speaker 2>successful ideology and so the social</v>
<v Speaker 2>structure is basically stable and</v>

211
00:13:27.251 --> 00:13:30.490
<v Speaker 2>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then your emotions are regulated so well</v>

212
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:32.470
<v Speaker 2>that you don't even know that they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

213
00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:36.700
<v Speaker 2>Just to say that you're protected by</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that you don't understand from</v>

214
00:13:36.701 --> 00:13:40.270
<v Speaker 2>something that you don't comprehend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I want to do is open the gates</v>

215
00:13:40.271 --> 00:13:44.560
<v Speaker 2>a little bit and let you see what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath your comfortable social</v>

216
00:13:44.561 --> 00:13:49.120
<v Speaker 2>identities and what it is that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>protected from by the weight of your</v>

217
00:13:49.121 --> 00:13:49.954
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

218
00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:55.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the central question I guess.</v>

219
00:13:55.581 --> 00:13:59.540
<v Speaker 2>Then like first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think social aggression is a primary</v>

220
00:13:59.541 --> 00:14:02.600
<v Speaker 2>Cuban characteristics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you even have a cursory knowledge of</v>

221
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:05.210
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's obviously the case work or plays in</v>

222
00:14:05.211 --> 00:14:08.870
<v Speaker 2>the man's role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to be the case that this is</v>

223
00:14:08.871 --> 00:14:11.180
<v Speaker 2>also true down the find a genetic</v>
<v Speaker 2>lottery.</v>

224
00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean for a long time it was thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

225
00:14:12.861 --> 00:14:17.390
<v Speaker 2>the chimpanzees live peaceably and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>appears to be the case as long as you</v>

226
00:14:17.391 --> 00:14:22.391
<v Speaker 2>studied chimpanzee's within their own</v>
<v Speaker 2>family or kin unit or I suppose roughly</v>

227
00:14:22.401 --> 00:14:25.280
<v Speaker 2>speaking tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a piece of lead to each other</v>

228
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:27.430
<v Speaker 2>even in their dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance dispute.</v>

229
00:14:27.431 --> 00:14:30.330
<v Speaker 2>So usually settled more or less</v>
<v Speaker 2>peacefully good.</v>

230
00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:34.820
<v Speaker 2>All discovered not so long ago that</v>
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzees conduct wars and clan wars</v>

231
00:14:34.821 --> 00:14:39.230
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by all occurrences when a chimp group is</v>

232
00:14:39.231 --> 00:14:43.100
<v Speaker 2>faced with an interloper from another</v>
<v Speaker 2>group or with another group that they're</v>

233
00:14:43.101 --> 00:14:45.110
<v Speaker 2>capable of engaging in the same sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>

234
00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:48.590
<v Speaker 2>have much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much more fundamental level in the sense</v>

235
00:14:48.591 --> 00:14:52.640
<v Speaker 2>that we are and also seems to be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>case as we'll see a little bit later in</v>

236
00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:54.530
<v Speaker 2>this discussion that similar things are</v>
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

237
00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:58.150
<v Speaker 2>Even animals is as simple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak is wrapped,</v>

238
00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:01.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like the capacity for.</v>

239
00:15:01.011 --> 00:15:03.740
<v Speaker 2>So it's strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's strange because it's obvious that</v>

240
00:15:03.741 --> 00:15:06.680
<v Speaker 2>people have a tremendous capacity for</v>
<v Speaker 2>social affiliation.</v>

241
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:08.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we made groups in the West.</v>

242
00:15:08.181 --> 00:15:10.940
<v Speaker 2>People are usually considered as rugged</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual,</v>

243
00:15:10.941 --> 00:15:12.110
<v Speaker 2>less so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's all,</v>

244
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.240
<v Speaker 2>it's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even in the most individualistic of</v>

245
00:15:14.241 --> 00:15:17.570
<v Speaker 2>societies that were constantly in</v>
<v Speaker 2>contact with other people.</v>

246
00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Almost all our environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's other people,</v>

247
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:23.270
<v Speaker 2>we're all members of literally often</v>
<v Speaker 2>dozens of groups,</v>

248
00:15:23.271 --> 00:15:27.500
<v Speaker 2>families and in groups devoted towards</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain tasks and and so on and so</v>

249
00:15:27.501 --> 00:15:28.251
<v Speaker 2>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're very,</v>

250
00:15:28.251 --> 00:15:31.040
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very social thrive in a social</v>

251
00:15:31.041 --> 00:15:33.050
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it looks like the flip side of that</v>

252
00:15:33.051 --> 00:15:36.950
<v Speaker 2>is the fact that we're so capable of</v>
<v Speaker 2>making social groups also makes us very</v>

253
00:15:36.951 --> 00:15:40.370
<v Speaker 2>capable of organized aggression against</v>
<v Speaker 2>other social groups.</v>

254
00:15:40.371 --> 00:15:42.890
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the strange phenomena that it's our</v>

255
00:15:42.891 --> 00:15:47.891
<v Speaker 2>very capacity for social organization</v>
<v Speaker 2>that also gives us this terrible</v>

256
00:15:47.991 --> 00:15:49.520
<v Speaker 2>capacity for social aggression.</v>

257
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.550
<v Speaker 2>So that's another thing that I want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a look at it of course,</v>

258
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:55.160
<v Speaker 2>like I really want to get at the core of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this too.</v>

259
00:15:55.161 --> 00:15:56.950
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said ago,</v>

260
00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:00.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm not interested in messing around</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a question on an abstract level.</v>

261
00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:05.650
<v Speaker 2>I want to end the course with concrete</v>
<v Speaker 2>answers about why it is that people are</v>

262
00:16:07.371 --> 00:16:10.800
<v Speaker 2>capable of doing the sorts of things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that characterize not to behavior say</v>

263
00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:14.060
<v Speaker 2>during the Holocaust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to make that so crystal clear</v>

264
00:16:14.061 --> 00:16:19.061
<v Speaker 2>that you can map out the argument from</v>
<v Speaker 2>precept position a tick to conclusion d</v>

265
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:22.100
<v Speaker 2>so that it's socially and personally</v>
<v Speaker 2>approved,</v>

266
00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.640
<v Speaker 2>clickable and so that you also get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>glimpse perhaps of what might be</v>

267
00:16:28.641 --> 00:16:33.641
<v Speaker 2>necessary from the perspective of</v>
<v Speaker 2>personal and interpersonal conduct to</v>

268
00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:38.540
<v Speaker 2>alleviate the likelihood that you'll get</v>
<v Speaker 2>trapped into doing something like that.</v>

269
00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:42.380
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the things you pointed out</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause he was very concerned with events.</v>

270
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:45.130
<v Speaker 2>The second reward and social aggression</v>
<v Speaker 2>in general,</v>

271
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:50.170
<v Speaker 2>he said you have to understand is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>these great evils tend to take place one</v>

272
00:16:50.751 --> 00:16:54.130
<v Speaker 2>small step at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do people get tracked into them over a</v>

273
00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:58.490
<v Speaker 2>long period of time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You make a small bad error but it</v>

274
00:16:58.491 --> 00:17:02.240
<v Speaker 2>doesn't look so big at the time at least</v>
<v Speaker 2>to another type of error.</v>

275
00:17:02.241 --> 00:17:05.000
<v Speaker 2>That snot so baby as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that leads to a third era and he</v>

276
00:17:05.001 --> 00:17:07.160
<v Speaker 2>spoke so big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you've put together 40 of those</v>

277
00:17:07.161 --> 00:17:10.340
<v Speaker 2>areas or 50 of those errors and all of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sudden you see that someone's traveling</v>

278
00:17:10.341 --> 00:17:13.940
<v Speaker 2>down a road to a place where they might</v>
<v Speaker 2>not want it to have gone in the</v>

279
00:17:13.941 --> 00:17:15.710
<v Speaker 2>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have they been conscious of it?</v>

280
00:17:15.711 --> 00:17:20.330
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things about never</v>
<v Speaker 2>forgetting is to understand</v>

281
00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:24.590
<v Speaker 2>is to engage in primary prevention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

282
00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:28.700
<v Speaker 2>which is to understand how the sweetness</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the second half of,</v>

283
00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:33.720
<v Speaker 2>of course has to do with that issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly personal relationship to</v>

284
00:17:34.521 --> 00:17:37.050
<v Speaker 2>group identity and group fostered</v>
<v Speaker 2>action.</v>

285
00:17:37.051 --> 00:17:40.220
<v Speaker 2>So the first part of the course</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically deals with why it is that</v>

286
00:17:40.221 --> 00:17:45.221
<v Speaker 2>we're susceptible to social aggression</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a consequence of our biological</v>

287
00:17:46.491 --> 00:17:49.230
<v Speaker 2>makeup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it is about us that makes us like</v>

288
00:17:49.231 --> 00:17:51.510
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the second part of the course is</v>

289
00:17:51.511 --> 00:17:56.511
<v Speaker 2>about how certain patterns of personal</v>
<v Speaker 2>calm down heighten the possibility is</v>

290
00:17:58.291 --> 00:18:02.880
<v Speaker 2>socially aggressive acts will take place</v>
<v Speaker 2>and about how it is that you might avoid</v>

291
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.890
<v Speaker 2>engaging in all sorts of that.</v>

292
00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:11.680
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>
<v Speaker 3>an overhead</v>

293
00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:18.730
<v Speaker 2>detail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of the things I've already</v>

294
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:20.540
<v Speaker 2>discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So good home here.</v>

295
00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell you a story from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Soviet Union.</v>

296
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:28.570
<v Speaker 2>It's soldier knit some total.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He introduces it with the home from the</v>

297
00:18:28.571 --> 00:18:33.571
<v Speaker 2>Russian poet Mayakovsky</v>
<v Speaker 2>with cohesion,</v>

298
00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:37.270
<v Speaker 2>construction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grit and repression.</v>

299
00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:41.590
<v Speaker 2>Bring the neck of this gang run riot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nice.</v>

300
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:44.920
<v Speaker 2>Pole social knits and wondering who was</v>
<v Speaker 2>the game.</v>

301
00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.510
<v Speaker 2>That's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As I said,</v>

302
00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:51.540
<v Speaker 2>he has to make 66 million people died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Soviet Union between 1917 to 1959</v>

303
00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:55.260
<v Speaker 2>Solzhenitsyn also estimated that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>substantially larger number of parish in</v>

304
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:58.330
<v Speaker 2>Communist China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one really knows the staffs on that.</v>

305
00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:02.560
<v Speaker 2>Now this is a debatable statistic as</v>
<v Speaker 2>Social Nixon points out in this book,</v>

306
00:19:02.561 --> 00:19:05.470
<v Speaker 2>this is from the Gulag archipelago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As he said,</v>

307
00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:10.390
<v Speaker 2>as soon as the official statistics are</v>
<v Speaker 2>released to revise his estimates.</v>

308
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:13.720
<v Speaker 2>This includes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

309
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:18.990
<v Speaker 2>several millions million hasn't pushed</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the Tundra and forced relocation in</v>

310
00:19:19.181 --> 00:19:21.510
<v Speaker 2>your early twenties 6 million</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ukrainians,</v>

311
00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:25.180
<v Speaker 2>we six months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have even the famines in the 1930s</v>

312
00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.260
<v Speaker 3>pretty good a story.</v>

313
00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:41.660
<v Speaker 2>So this is the situation.</v>

314
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.680
<v Speaker 2>So what did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did she tell you a little bit about his</v>

315
00:19:46.681 --> 00:19:49.410
<v Speaker 2>life story?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go like archipelago is a three</v>

316
00:19:49.411 --> 00:19:53.640
<v Speaker 2>volume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second volume of which you will read</v>

317
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.100
<v Speaker 2>is his story about the blue light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good light.</v>

318
00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:03.120
<v Speaker 2>It was a system of forced labor camps</v>
<v Speaker 2>set up in the Soviet Union soon after</v>

319
00:20:04.381 --> 00:20:05.800
<v Speaker 2>late and die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

320
00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.220
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them were set up before he died</v>

321
00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:11.670
<v Speaker 2>and upon which the Soviet economy duty</v>
<v Speaker 2>ran for much of,</v>

322
00:20:11.671 --> 00:20:14.760
<v Speaker 2>it's for much of what constituted its</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

323
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:19.230
<v Speaker 2>Soldier Solzhenitsyn's started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has traveled through the ghoulag</v>

324
00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:22.530
<v Speaker 2>originally as a Russian is frontline</v>
<v Speaker 2>soldier.</v>

325
00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:27.650
<v Speaker 2>So neat story and Sam's got thrown into</v>
<v Speaker 2>a German prisoner of war camp and when</v>

326
00:20:28.741 --> 00:20:33.741
<v Speaker 2>he was repatriated to the Soviet Union</v>
<v Speaker 2>stabling through Beta in a concentration</v>

327
00:20:34.021 --> 00:20:36.530
<v Speaker 2>camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason was as he did with all</v>

328
00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:40.740
<v Speaker 2>the return Russian prisoners of war who</v>
<v Speaker 2>are treated by the way terribly and the</v>

329
00:20:40.741 --> 00:20:45.060
<v Speaker 2>German prisoners of war camps because</v>
<v Speaker 2>stellman refused to sign the Geneva</v>

330
00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:46.290
<v Speaker 2>Convention on the treatment of</v>
<v Speaker 2>prisoners.</v>

331
00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.700
<v Speaker 2>So not only were they in prisoners of</v>
<v Speaker 2>war camps,</v>

332
00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:53.860
<v Speaker 2>which was miserable enough that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were starved to the degree that the</v>

333
00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.710
<v Speaker 2>other allied prisoners used to give them</v>
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>

334
00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:00.460
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have much food themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he was a front line soldier.</v>

335
00:21:00.461 --> 00:21:03.610
<v Speaker 2>Then he got thrown in a German prisoner</v>
<v Speaker 2>of war camp and then when he finally</v>

336
00:21:03.611 --> 00:21:06.430
<v Speaker 2>returned to Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stellan through and the concentration</v>

337
00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:10.390
<v Speaker 2>camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason for that was that the</v>

338
00:21:10.391 --> 00:21:15.391
<v Speaker 2>Russians who were in German prisoners of</v>
<v Speaker 2>war camp had been contaminated by their</v>

339
00:21:15.431 --> 00:21:18.820
<v Speaker 2>exposure to western ideas and that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>his rationale.</v>

340
00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:22.690
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then he spent a decade and a half or</v>

341
00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:25.930
<v Speaker 2>thereabouts and concentration camps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when he got out he developed stomach</v>

342
00:21:25.931 --> 00:21:29.980
<v Speaker 2>cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a brief summary of some of the</v>

343
00:21:29.981 --> 00:21:31.990
<v Speaker 2>highlights of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

344
00:21:31.991 --> 00:21:35.410
<v Speaker 2>In this scene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's being transported from one camp to</v>

345
00:21:35.411 --> 00:21:36.950
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

346
00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:40.850
<v Speaker 2>a railway car that's being roughly</v>
<v Speaker 2>outfitted for transporting human beings.</v>

347
00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:43.510
<v Speaker 2>He's sitting with the friend that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>calls panic.</v>

348
00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:48.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to read you this story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend pattern and I are lying on the</v>

349
00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:49.900
<v Speaker 2>Middle Shelf of a stall up in</v>
<v Speaker 2>compartment.</v>

350
00:21:49.901 --> 00:21:52.420
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cattle cars basically to refit it for</v>

351
00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:55.330
<v Speaker 2>human transport and have set ourselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>up comfortably,</v>

352
00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:59.290
<v Speaker 2>talk to our salt carrying in our pocket</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we don't need water and can go to</v>

353
00:21:59.291 --> 00:22:02.740
<v Speaker 2>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at some station or other,</v>

354
00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:06.700
<v Speaker 2>they shoved into our compartment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Marxist scholar.</v>

355
00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.390
<v Speaker 2>We can tell this from his goatee and</v>
<v Speaker 2>spectacles.</v>

356
00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:13.000
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't hide the fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So He's been arrested.</v>

357
00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.420
<v Speaker 2>He's a devout communist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being arrested by the communists.</v>

358
00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.060
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't hide the fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a former professor of the</v>

359
00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:22.570
<v Speaker 2>guardianist academy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We hang head down in the square,</v>

360
00:22:22.571 --> 00:22:27.220
<v Speaker 2>cut out from his very first words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We see that he is impenetrable,</v>

361
00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:32.760
<v Speaker 2>but we have been serving time for a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>long time and have a long time left to</v>

362
00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:34.990
<v Speaker 2>serve and we value of Mary joke.</v>

363
00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:37.780
<v Speaker 2>We'd was pointing down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have fun.</v>

364
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.350
<v Speaker 2>There's ample space left in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>compartment.</v>

365
00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:44.020
<v Speaker 2>So we exchanged places with someone and</v>
<v Speaker 2>crowd in.</v>

366
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:46.540
<v Speaker 2>Hello?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hello?</v>

367
00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.270
<v Speaker 2>You don't too crowded?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

368
00:22:49.271 --> 00:22:52.480
<v Speaker 2>it's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you been in the jug a long time?</v>

369
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:56.260
<v Speaker 2>Long enough or you past the halfway</v>
<v Speaker 2>mark?</v>

370
00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:00.280
<v Speaker 2>Just</v>
<v Speaker 2>look over there.</v>

371
00:23:00.281 --> 00:23:03.520
<v Speaker 2>How poverty stricken her villages are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Straw thatch,</v>

372
00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:08.230
<v Speaker 2>crooked hugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an inheritance heritance from the</v>

373
00:23:08.231 --> 00:23:13.120
<v Speaker 2>czarist regime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we've already had 30 Soviet years.</v>

374
00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:15.940
<v Speaker 2>That's an insignificant period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Historic.</v>

375
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:20.560
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible that the collective</v>
<v Speaker 2>farmers are starving,</v>

376
00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:27.220
<v Speaker 2>but have you look in all the wrappings</v>
<v Speaker 2>just ask any collective farber in</v>

377
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:28.800
<v Speaker 2>apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

378
00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:31.180
<v Speaker 2>everyone in jail is embittered and</v>
<v Speaker 2>prejudice,</v>

379
00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:37.080
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen collective farms myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means they were uncharacteristic.</v>

380
00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.930
<v Speaker 2>The goatee had never been in any of them</v>
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>

381
00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:41.923
<v Speaker 2>Simpler.</v>

382
00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:48.260
<v Speaker 2>Just ask the old folks and bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were well fed,</v>

383
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:52.100
<v Speaker 2>well clothed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they used to have many holidays.</v>

384
00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:56.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even going to ask.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a subjective trait of human memory</v>

385
00:23:56.601 --> 00:24:00.770
<v Speaker 2>to praise everything in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cow or the died is the one that gave</v>

386
00:24:00.771 --> 00:24:05.290
<v Speaker 2>twice the milk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes even certain problems and</v>

387
00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:08.420
<v Speaker 2>there are people don't like holidays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like to work.</v>

388
00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:14.630
<v Speaker 2>Why is there a shortage of brandon?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many cities when right before the war,</v>

389
00:24:14.631 --> 00:24:17.960
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not true before the war,</v>

390
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:23.060
<v Speaker 2>everything in fact and be more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen at that time in all the cities on</v>

391
00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:25.610
<v Speaker 2>the pool guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were accused of thousands of</v>

392
00:24:25.611 --> 00:24:28.730
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a local failure and supply.</v>

393
00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:33.350
<v Speaker 2>More likely your memory's failing you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there this shortage.</v>

394
00:24:33.351 --> 00:24:38.351
<v Speaker 2>Now old wives tales we have from seven</v>
<v Speaker 2>to 8 billion bushels of grain.</v>

395
00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:44.570
<v Speaker 2>The grain is rotten,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not so we've been very successful in</v>

396
00:24:44.571 --> 00:24:46.310
<v Speaker 2>developing new species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great</v>

397
00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:48.793
<v Speaker 2>and so forth.</v>

398
00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.430
<v Speaker 2>He's going to perturb level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He speaks in the language between</v>

399
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:55.250
<v Speaker 2>quarters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no effort of the mind and arguing with</v>

400
00:24:55.251 --> 00:24:59.510
<v Speaker 2>him is like walking through a desert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about people like that,</v>

401
00:24:59.511 --> 00:25:03.290
<v Speaker 2>but they say he made the rounds of all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the blocks smiths and came home on Shawn</v>

402
00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:09.630
<v Speaker 2>and when they write in their obituaries</v>
<v Speaker 2>perished tragically during the period of</v>

403
00:25:09.631 --> 00:25:13.460
<v Speaker 2>the stone in this cult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should be corrected to read perished</v>

404
00:25:13.461 --> 00:25:16.880
<v Speaker 2>comically benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Faith had worked out differently.</v>

405
00:25:16.881 --> 00:25:20.270
<v Speaker 2>We would have never learned what a dry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>insignificant little man he really was.</v>

406
00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.700
<v Speaker 2>We would have respectfully read his name</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the newspaper.</v>

407
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:24.920
<v Speaker 2>We would have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would have become a people's</v>

408
00:25:24.921 --> 00:25:28.220
<v Speaker 2>commissar or even ventured to represent</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole Russia abroad.</v>

409
00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.430
<v Speaker 2>To argue with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was useless.</v>

410
00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.620
<v Speaker 2>It was much more interesting to play</v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

411
00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:38.360
<v Speaker 2>It don't a chess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the game of comrades already is</v>

412
00:25:38.361 --> 00:25:39.194
<v Speaker 2>such a game.</v>

413
00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:43.940
<v Speaker 2>It's very simple game play up to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A couple of times or so,</v>

414
00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:46.370
<v Speaker 2>you used some of his own pet words and</v>
<v Speaker 2>phrases.</v>

415
00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:50.180
<v Speaker 2>He'll like that phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grown accustomed to find it all around</v>

416
00:25:50.181 --> 00:25:53.650
<v Speaker 2>him are enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's become weary of snarling and</v>

417
00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:57.230
<v Speaker 2>doesn't like to tell his stories because</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of them will be twisted and thrown</v>

418
00:25:57.231 --> 00:26:00.560
<v Speaker 2>right back into space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if he takes you for one of his own,</v>

419
00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.510
<v Speaker 2>he will quite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keven only disclosed to you.</v>

420
00:26:02.511 --> 00:26:06.380
<v Speaker 2>What have you seen at the station?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are passing by talking,</v>

421
00:26:06.381 --> 00:26:08.000
<v Speaker 2>laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Life goes on.</v>

422
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:12.530
<v Speaker 2>The party is providing leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are being moved from job to job.</v>

423
00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.290
<v Speaker 2>If you and I are languishing here in</v>
<v Speaker 2>prison,</v>

424
00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:19.760
<v Speaker 2>there are only a handful of us and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>must write and write petitions,</v>

425
00:26:19.761 --> 00:26:22.460
<v Speaker 2>begging a review of our cases for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pardon</v>

426
00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:26.360
<v Speaker 2>or he will tell you something</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

427
00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:32.540
<v Speaker 2>In the Communist Academy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they decided to devour one program and</v>

428
00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:36.970
<v Speaker 2>he decided he wasn't quite genuine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of our own and somehow they couldn't</v>

429
00:26:36.971 --> 00:26:39.980
<v Speaker 2>manage it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were no errors in his assets and</v>

430
00:26:39.981 --> 00:26:43.950
<v Speaker 2>his biography was clean and all of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sudden going through the archives,</v>

431
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.580
<v Speaker 1>what a fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ran across an old brochure written</v>

432
00:26:47.581 --> 00:26:51.750
<v Speaker 1>by his comrade in which Vladimir Ilyich</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lenin himself had held in his hands.</v>

433
00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:54.600
<v Speaker 1>And in the margin of which he had</v>
<v Speaker 1>written in his own handwriting.</v>

434
00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:57.930
<v Speaker 1>The notation has it in the economist is</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

435
00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:03.080
<v Speaker 1>well now you understand or smile</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially,</v>

436
00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:06.840
<v Speaker 1>but after that it's no trouble at all to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make short work of that model.</v>

437
00:27:06.841 --> 00:27:10.680
<v Speaker 1>Hadn't paused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was expelled from the academy and</v>

438
00:27:10.681 --> 00:27:15.681
<v Speaker 1>deprived of the scholar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This story.</v>

439
00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:32.180
<v Speaker 1>That's a perfect example of the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena that I'm interested in trying</v>

440
00:27:32.791 --> 00:27:36.960
<v Speaker 1>to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The communist professor,</v>

441
00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:38.790
<v Speaker 1>this exchange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't think,</v>

442
00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.060
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have to think because he has</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ideological system that time it</v>

443
00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:43.913
<v Speaker 1>worked out.</v>

444
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:50.750
<v Speaker 1>He won't admit</v>
<v Speaker 1>any evidence whatsoever exists to</v>

445
00:27:50.971 --> 00:27:53.490
<v Speaker 1>suggest that some of his presuppositions</v>
<v Speaker 1>are wrong.</v>

446
00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:58.680
<v Speaker 1>For every bit of evidence that exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a counter argument that</v>

447
00:27:58.681 --> 00:28:02.820
<v Speaker 1>justifies it or excuse it or makes it</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappear in some way.</v>

448
00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:07.800
<v Speaker 1>That's the first part of this story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second part of the story is that</v>

449
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:13.310
<v Speaker 1>being like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's also extraordinarily clannish in a</v>

450
00:28:13.411 --> 00:28:15.780
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you tell us a brief story about</v>

451
00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:21.630
<v Speaker 1>being in the Communist Academy where</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone shares in urology and finding</v>

452
00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:26.640
<v Speaker 1>outside yourself essentially destroyed</v>
<v Speaker 1>there specific reasons why the two</v>

453
00:28:30.031 --> 00:28:33.210
<v Speaker 1>halves of that narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're stuck together because the first</v>

454
00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:37.320
<v Speaker 1>attitude leads in absorb link to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>second attitude,</v>

455
00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:41.670
<v Speaker 1>which is to say the adoption and</v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian etiology,</v>

456
00:28:41.671 --> 00:28:44.720
<v Speaker 1>which is basically the presumption of</v>
<v Speaker 1>omniscience in a sense.</v>

457
00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:48.000
<v Speaker 1>If you're an idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think that what you think is the</v>

458
00:28:48.001 --> 00:28:50.640
<v Speaker 1>right thing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There isn't anything else that needs to</v>

459
00:28:50.641 --> 00:28:51.300
<v Speaker 1>be thought.</v>

460
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:53.310
<v Speaker 1>It's you that has the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might know,</v>

461
00:28:53.311 --> 00:28:55.170
<v Speaker 1>thank it's you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might even think that it's your</v>

462
00:28:55.171 --> 00:28:58.950
<v Speaker 1>leader or the ideology in and of itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point is you're the one that's</v>

463
00:28:58.951 --> 00:29:03.951
<v Speaker 1>in possession of the absolute truth in</v>
<v Speaker 1>every fact that might exist to dispute</v>

464
00:29:04.561 --> 00:29:08.580
<v Speaker 1>that is eliminated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a problem with the limited facts is</v>

465
00:29:08.581 --> 00:29:10.650
<v Speaker 1>that sometimes they come in and body</v>
<v Speaker 1>form,</v>

466
00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:14.250
<v Speaker 1>which is to say we tend to think of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas as disembodied abstract and</v>

467
00:29:14.251 --> 00:29:16.250
<v Speaker 1>entities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the truth of the matter is that</v>

468
00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:21.000
<v Speaker 1>ideas are representations of human</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns of action and sometimes the</v>

469
00:29:21.001 --> 00:29:26.001
<v Speaker 1>enemy idea is actually the enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's very little difference from</v>

470
00:29:26.011 --> 00:29:31.011
<v Speaker 1>the practical perspective between</v>
<v Speaker 1>repressing facts that are uncomfortable</v>

471
00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:37.400
<v Speaker 1>and repressing people whose viewpoints</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even styles of existence are equal in</v>

472
00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:41.250
<v Speaker 1>long term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is another example,</v>

473
00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.160
<v Speaker 1>this sort of thinking that I want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>explain,</v>

474
00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:45.190
<v Speaker 1>I want to spend the motivation for that.</v>

475
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:50.430
<v Speaker 1>Why is it that someone would adopt a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rigid ideological position and then</v>

476
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:56.190
<v Speaker 1>defend it sometimes to their own debt</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more frequently to the death of</v>

477
00:29:56.351 --> 00:29:59.440
<v Speaker 1>others and to feel that not only is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that</v>

478
00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:04.000
<v Speaker 1>acceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd often even morally justifiable.</v>

479
00:30:04.001 --> 00:30:07.760
<v Speaker 1>It's is the thing that should be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a good Patriot so just</v>

480
00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:20.270
<v Speaker 1>so</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the quick thesis.</v>

481
00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:22.180
<v Speaker 1>This is what I want to address and of</v>
<v Speaker 1>course</v>

482
00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:29.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to use this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said I don't want to take a stab at</v>

483
00:30:29.801 --> 00:30:34.220
<v Speaker 1>the question so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to beat around the Bush on</v>

484
00:30:34.221 --> 00:30:37.630
<v Speaker 1>an answer these so that when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>finished of course you will.</v>

485
00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.640
<v Speaker 1>What purpose group identification</v>
<v Speaker 1>serves,</v>

486
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:43.450
<v Speaker 1>why it's so important to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it developed,</v>

487
00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:48.820
<v Speaker 1>what it means to have a belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have beliefs.</v>

488
00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:52.600
<v Speaker 1>We never really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a question we get is what it means</v>

489
00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.420
<v Speaker 1>when you say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

490
00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:59.890
<v Speaker 1>I think the world is in a particular way</v>
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to some other particular way.</v>

491
00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Why do we feel threatened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were in groups.</v>

492
00:31:03.131 --> 00:31:08.131
<v Speaker 1>We identify with our challenged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does challenge me as aggressive and</v>

493
00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:13.150
<v Speaker 1>righteously and sort of the core.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess those are the core questions of</v>

494
00:31:13.151 --> 00:31:14.110
<v Speaker 1>course centers around.</v>

495
00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:19.900
<v Speaker 1>There's more I can describe the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

496
00:31:19.901 --> 00:31:24.901
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it's the first lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is about half the half the story.</v>

497
00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:31.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm also interested in how our own</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal behaviors make our group</v>

498
00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:36.840
<v Speaker 1>identification more or less dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what can be done about that as well.</v>

499
00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:48.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

500
00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:58.470
<v Speaker 1>do you understand why we are capable of</v>
<v Speaker 1>atrocious behavior?</v>

501
00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:07.150
<v Speaker 1>You have to understand how we think and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to approach that from a variety</v>

502
00:32:07.151 --> 00:32:10.700
<v Speaker 1>of different perspectives giving you</v>
<v Speaker 1>initially he grounding and mortar neuro</v>

503
00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:15.400
<v Speaker 1>psychology or psychology and emotion and</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional regulation because that puts</v>

504
00:32:15.401 --> 00:32:18.660
<v Speaker 1>the discussion on what I think is a firm</v>
<v Speaker 1>foundation.</v>

505
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.480
<v Speaker 1>He said I bring in 10 political ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ideas from literature and philosophy</v>

506
00:32:22.481 --> 00:32:24.820
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's nice to also have reference to</v>

507
00:32:24.821 --> 00:32:29.821
<v Speaker 1>some facts that are acceptable as facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when you start,</v>

508
00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:32.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology well,</v>

509
00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:37.380
<v Speaker 1>how do we think this is half the store?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll discuss the other half as we go</v>

510
00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:38.223
<v Speaker 1>through the course.</v>

511
00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:49.120
<v Speaker 2>The course is</v>
<v Speaker 2>predicated on a theory of knowledge.</v>

512
00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:57.300
<v Speaker 2>Let's suggest that we classify objects</v>
<v Speaker 2>in situations according to two separate</v>

513
00:33:00.111 --> 00:33:03.740
<v Speaker 2>types of schemes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the first type of scheme is one that</v>

514
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:06.990
<v Speaker 2>everyone was essentially familiar with</v>
<v Speaker 2>apps.</v>

515
00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:11.690
<v Speaker 2>The scientific scheme that makes the</v>
<v Speaker 2>presupposition that there's an objective</v>

516
00:33:11.691 --> 00:33:16.330
<v Speaker 2>world that's apprehensible to the census</v>
<v Speaker 2>make,</v>

517
00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:20.960
<v Speaker 2>can be collectively describe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is only to say that the thing is</v>

518
00:33:20.961 --> 00:33:22.910
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can sense it,</v>

519
00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:27.290
<v Speaker 2>choose me means if you can touch it or</v>
<v Speaker 2>see it or in some other way detected.</v>

520
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:31.400
<v Speaker 2>If you can describe the price procedures</v>
<v Speaker 2>by which now detection.</v>

521
00:33:31.401 --> 00:33:34.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh Curd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if someone else duplicating those</v>

522
00:33:34.401 --> 00:33:39.130
<v Speaker 2>procedures comes up with this same</v>
<v Speaker 2>observations and that's a real thing and</v>

523
00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:42.740
<v Speaker 2>that's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a scientific fact and we've been</v>

524
00:33:42.741 --> 00:33:47.741
<v Speaker 2>able to codify a methodology for</v>
<v Speaker 2>determining what is from the objective</v>

525
00:33:49.101 --> 00:33:53.300
<v Speaker 2>perspective and I don't think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no real reason to dispute that</v>

526
00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:55.100
<v Speaker 2>seems more or less self evident.</v>

527
00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:59.330
<v Speaker 2>It's a relatively new procedure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've only been really good at it for</v>

528
00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:03.470
<v Speaker 2>500 years at the most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be in that long since the</v>

529
00:34:03.471 --> 00:34:07.190
<v Speaker 2>scientific enterprise is being</v>
<v Speaker 2>transformed into something that was</v>

530
00:34:07.191 --> 00:34:09.770
<v Speaker 2>actually codify.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's obviously an extraordinary</v>

531
00:34:09.771 --> 00:34:14.600
<v Speaker 2>efficient way to proceed and there's no</v>
<v Speaker 2>point in a sense,</v>

532
00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:20.360
<v Speaker 2>been debating is utility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one type of</v>

533
00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.430
<v Speaker 2>knowledge scheme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's another type</v>

534
00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:32.430
<v Speaker 2>that people have spent much less time</v>
<v Speaker 2>formalize it partly because it's more</v>

535
00:34:32.751 --> 00:34:35.930
<v Speaker 2>difficult before we want to say with</v>
<v Speaker 2>regards to the scientific method,</v>

536
00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:39.410
<v Speaker 2>we more or less have a set of agreed</v>
<v Speaker 2>upon rules by which the endeavor should</v>

537
00:34:39.411 --> 00:34:44.030
<v Speaker 2>proceed and also by which to judge the</v>
<v Speaker 2>validity of the outcomes of the</v>

538
00:34:44.031 --> 00:34:45.980
<v Speaker 2>procedures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can write them down.</v>

539
00:34:45.981 --> 00:34:48.860
<v Speaker 2>They're very much formalized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why almost anybody can do</v>

540
00:34:48.861 --> 00:34:51.770
<v Speaker 2>scientific research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the type of scientific</v>

541
00:34:51.771 --> 00:34:53.720
<v Speaker 2>research that Tom is tuned described as</v>
<v Speaker 2>normal,</v>

542
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:56.690
<v Speaker 2>which basically means that you have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>set theory what's you're not trying to</v>

543
00:34:56.691 --> 00:34:59.900
<v Speaker 2>challenge and working with him to theory</v>
<v Speaker 2>to more or less flesh it out,</v>

544
00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:05.320
<v Speaker 2>so a technician putting into work potent</v>
<v Speaker 2>technical tools that you can virtually</v>

545
00:35:07.581 --> 00:35:08.414
<v Speaker 2>do by rote.</v>

546
00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:10.880
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we figured out how to formalize that.</v>

547
00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.460
<v Speaker 2>That's an answer to the question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>

548
00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:17.270
<v Speaker 2>how to control things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second type of inflammation.</v>

549
00:35:17.271 --> 00:35:21.440
<v Speaker 2>That's the type of that I am concerned</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this course and that is not what a</v>

550
00:35:21.441 --> 00:35:26.441
<v Speaker 2>thing is from the objective perspective</v>
<v Speaker 2>but about what it is from the</v>

551
00:35:26.721 --> 00:35:31.400
<v Speaker 2>perspective of determining its</v>
<v Speaker 2>implications for behavior and to say,</v>

552
00:35:31.401 --> 00:35:35.900
<v Speaker 2>well there are things and there is also</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge about how to behave in your</v>

553
00:35:35.901 --> 00:35:39.540
<v Speaker 2>presence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First kind of information you might</v>

554
00:35:39.541 --> 00:35:42.780
<v Speaker 2>consider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second kind of inflammation is more</v>

555
00:35:42.781 --> 00:35:46.470
<v Speaker 2>akin to what has been traditionally</v>
<v Speaker 2>described as wisdom because wisdom is</v>

556
00:35:46.471 --> 00:35:48.480
<v Speaker 2>the knowledge of how to conduct</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

557
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:54.190
<v Speaker 2>Things exist and the fact that their</v>
<v Speaker 2>existence has implications for behavior</v>

558
00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:59.640
<v Speaker 2>and what's the implications of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>existence of things for behavior that I</v>

559
00:35:59.641 --> 00:36:04.641
<v Speaker 2>want to focus on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because in our social command it's we</v>

560
00:36:04.951 --> 00:36:09.951
<v Speaker 2>come to agreements over vast stretches</v>
<v Speaker 2>of time about what sorts of behaviors</v>

561
00:36:10.801 --> 00:36:14.910
<v Speaker 2>are to be considered appropriate in</v>
<v Speaker 2>which situations and under which</v>

562
00:36:14.911 --> 00:36:18.300
<v Speaker 2>conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's this agreement Atlantans</v>

563
00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.670
<v Speaker 2>predictability to our interpersonal</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships.</v>

564
00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:25.380
<v Speaker 2>It can take an example just of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>course we all share map,</v>

565
00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:30.510
<v Speaker 2>so to speak of what behaviors are</v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriate in a situation like this.</v>

566
00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:34.170
<v Speaker 2>And essentially what that means is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can come in here and conduct our</v>

567
00:36:34.171 --> 00:36:37.380
<v Speaker 2>business and we all know what that</v>
<v Speaker 2>business is going to be.</v>

568
00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.910
<v Speaker 2>There's no dispute about that and we all</v>
<v Speaker 2>know more or less what our respective</v>

569
00:36:41.911 --> 00:36:44.700
<v Speaker 2>roles are going to be in conducting that</v>
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>

570
00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.890
<v Speaker 2>There's no real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no space for disputed at all,</v>

571
00:36:46.891 --> 00:36:51.090
<v Speaker 2>which basically means that our shared</v>
<v Speaker 2>map of the significance of the events</v>

572
00:36:51.091 --> 00:36:53.790
<v Speaker 2>that are occurring in this room</v>
<v Speaker 2>eliminates the need for conflict.</v>

573
00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:56.250
<v Speaker 2>We don't even have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have fight about what's going</v>

574
00:36:56.251 --> 00:36:57.990
<v Speaker 2>to happen here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have to fight about who owns</v>

575
00:36:57.991 --> 00:37:01.770
<v Speaker 2>that sunkist orange juice or who's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to take control of the pens or who owns</v>

576
00:37:01.771 --> 00:37:03.960
<v Speaker 2>that particular computer or who's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

577
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.500
<v Speaker 2>or how the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the discussion is going to proceed.</v>

578
00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:12.030
<v Speaker 2>That's all mapped out for us in some</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways and that means that we've rendered</v>

579
00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:15.360
<v Speaker 2>ourselves in this particular situation</v>
<v Speaker 2>predictable,</v>

580
00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:20.930
<v Speaker 2>which means that there's no reason for</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of us to regard any of the other</v>

581
00:37:21.031 --> 00:37:23.940
<v Speaker 2>people in the room with any sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>apprehension whatsoever.</v>

582
00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:28.320
<v Speaker 2>So in a sense you could say that for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a fixed object in terms of your</v>

583
00:37:28.321 --> 00:37:31.440
<v Speaker 2>significance in this environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is because we're</v>

584
00:37:31.441 --> 00:37:34.530
<v Speaker 2>engaging in a culturally determined</v>
<v Speaker 2>process,</v>

585
00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.900
<v Speaker 2>none of which were questioning or at</v>
<v Speaker 2>least that we've,</v>

586
00:37:36.901 --> 00:37:41.010
<v Speaker 2>we've accepted implicitly or explicitly</v>
<v Speaker 2>and implicitly you're out of university.</v>

587
00:37:41.011 --> 00:37:42.780
<v Speaker 2>This is what happens at a university,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

588
00:37:42.781 --> 00:37:45.760
<v Speaker 2>that I know of that we don't have to set</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of the ground.</v>

589
00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:51.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's our shared apprehensions about the</v>

590
00:37:53.101 --> 00:37:57.930
<v Speaker 2>implications of situations for behaviors</v>
<v Speaker 2>that constitute our cultures.</v>

591
00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:02.100
<v Speaker 2>And it's those shared maps that bring</v>
<v Speaker 2>predictability to our interpersonal</v>

592
00:38:02.101 --> 00:38:02.740
<v Speaker 2>relationships.</v>

593
00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:07.740
<v Speaker 2>And what that essentially you can only</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that if you understand what</v>

594
00:38:08.041 --> 00:38:09.840
<v Speaker 2>the world is like when it's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>predictable.</v>

595
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:14.280
<v Speaker 2>And it's difficult to understand that</v>
<v Speaker 2>for water and people who live in</v>

596
00:38:14.281 --> 00:38:18.270
<v Speaker 2>peaceful times because our culture is so</v>
<v Speaker 2>successful at regulating our</v>

597
00:38:18.271 --> 00:38:21.000
<v Speaker 2>interpersonal behavior and even the</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment for that matter.</v>

598
00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:25.290
<v Speaker 2>But we hardly ever encounter a situation</v>
<v Speaker 2>where anything remotely unpredictable</v>

599
00:38:25.291 --> 00:38:27.600
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't tell what it's like to be</v>

600
00:38:27.601 --> 00:38:29.220
<v Speaker 2>faced with something that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>unpredictable.</v>

601
00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:32.460
<v Speaker 2>So you don't know what it's like when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in an environment where culture</v>

602
00:38:32.461 --> 00:38:35.290
<v Speaker 2>doesn't rain because you're part of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>successful community in your</v>

603
00:38:35.291 --> 00:38:37.570
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily well protected it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

604
00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:40.510
<v Speaker 2>you're like a boy that lives inside the</v>
<v Speaker 2>castle.</v>

605
00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.360
<v Speaker 2>You can't see over the walls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even know that they're there</v>

606
00:38:43.361 --> 00:38:45.460
<v Speaker 2>and just all sorts of terrible things</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside the castle.</v>

607
00:38:45.461 --> 00:38:49.690
<v Speaker 2>But everything inside is peaceful and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the world and the boy has no idea</v>

608
00:38:49.691 --> 00:38:52.660
<v Speaker 2>what he would be like if he went outside</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the real world where things were</v>

609
00:38:52.661 --> 00:38:55.330
<v Speaker 2>actually not predictable because he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>only had a chance to observe his</v>

610
00:38:55.331 --> 00:38:59.410
<v Speaker 2>behavior under stable conditions where</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's predictable and acceptable.</v>

611
00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:03.250
<v Speaker 2>It's even worse now in a sense it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>better than waiting too.</v>

612
00:39:03.251 --> 00:39:08.251
<v Speaker 2>I mean he is peaceful now in many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean even compared to 15 years ago,</v>

613
00:39:09.401 --> 00:39:13.640
<v Speaker 2>there's much less ideological dispute in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world about how to conduct affairs.</v>

614
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:17.650
<v Speaker 2>Then there was staying in the mid</v>
<v Speaker 2>seventies and people are more or less,</v>

615
00:39:17.651 --> 00:39:19.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know there's exceptions to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

616
00:39:19.031 --> 00:39:22.210
<v Speaker 2>but people in the world over have more</v>
<v Speaker 2>or less accepted in this basket.</v>

617
00:39:22.211 --> 00:39:23.950
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a market and economy,</v>

618
00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:27.790
<v Speaker 2>there aren't very many ideologies that</v>
<v Speaker 2>appear attractive even in the</v>

619
00:39:27.791 --> 00:39:32.080
<v Speaker 2>imagination in contrast to two western</v>
<v Speaker 2>style democracies and I mean not so</v>

620
00:39:32.081 --> 00:39:35.200
<v Speaker 2>pretty recent occurrence and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlikely to last for any great length of</v>

621
00:39:35.201 --> 00:39:35.801
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

622
00:39:35.801 --> 00:39:40.801
<v Speaker 2>but it is peaceful now</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the fact that that piece makes it</v>

623
00:39:41.831 --> 00:39:44.770
<v Speaker 2>even more difficult for us to either to</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand ourselves or to be</v>

624
00:39:44.771 --> 00:39:48.280
<v Speaker 2>sufficiently motivated to understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself because when things are going</v>

625
00:39:48.281 --> 00:39:50.050
<v Speaker 2>really well and everything's</v>
<v Speaker 2>predictable,</v>

626
00:39:50.051 --> 00:39:52.060
<v Speaker 2>then you presume that you know what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing.</v>

627
00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:54.600
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the basis on which you,</v>

628
00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:57.910
<v Speaker 2>you base your judgments about whether</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what you're doing,</v>

629
00:39:57.911 --> 00:40:00.430
<v Speaker 2>if you perform a procedure and what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>predicted,</v>

630
00:40:00.431 --> 00:40:01.180
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>occurs.</v>

631
00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:03.430
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that doesn't mean you know</v>

632
00:40:03.431 --> 00:40:04.900
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as far as you're concerned,</v>

633
00:40:04.901 --> 00:40:05.734
<v Speaker 2>that's sufficient.</v>

634
00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:11.210
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental point is this.</v>

635
00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:17.410
<v Speaker 2>We share a map of the significance of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things and situations including other</v>

636
00:40:17.751 --> 00:40:20.440
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including ourselves and not maps or</v>

637
00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.720
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the lines of arguments that I</v>

638
00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:27.560
<v Speaker 2>want to develop throughout the course of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this course is that that shared culture</v>

639
00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:29.630
<v Speaker 2>takes the form of a story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

640
00:40:29.631 --> 00:40:34.130
<v Speaker 2>that's what his story is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A story is a description of the</v>

641
00:40:34.131 --> 00:40:39.131
<v Speaker 2>significance of situations or events for</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior and the stories.</v>

642
00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:45.190
<v Speaker 2>The kind of inflammation story is a form</v>
<v Speaker 2>of information that transmits abstract</v>

643
00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:51.140
<v Speaker 2>knowledge about how to add.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have on the one hand,</v>

644
00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:54.170
<v Speaker 2>scientific descriptions are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>descriptions of facts,</v>

645
00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:58.340
<v Speaker 2>things that are sensory apprehensible to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a collected and you had another form of</v>

646
00:40:58.341 --> 00:41:02.000
<v Speaker 2>information that's narrative and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative contains information,</v>

647
00:41:02.001 --> 00:41:05.360
<v Speaker 2>but how you should conduct yourself</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally how you should propel your</v>

648
00:41:05.361 --> 00:41:09.020
<v Speaker 2>body through space under which</v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances and the shared narrative</v>

649
00:41:09.021 --> 00:41:10.040
<v Speaker 2>post due to culture.</v>

650
00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:16.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me show you,</v>

651
00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:21.000
<v Speaker 2>but I think the basic structure of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>

652
00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:24.013
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

653
00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:27.540
<v Speaker 2>Scientific description is concerned with</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>

654
00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:31.290
<v Speaker 2>can we do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have rules for determining a story is</v>

655
00:41:31.291 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 2>concerned with what is known from the</v>

656
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.490
<v Speaker 1>perspective of the census.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But from the perspective of the</v>

657
00:41:36.491 --> 00:41:41.210
<v Speaker 1>implications for behave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the main essential things have</v>

658
00:41:41.211 --> 00:41:42.850
<v Speaker 1>an existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a meaning and the story is</v>

659
00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:47.860
<v Speaker 1>concerned with the meaning and</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning is a description of the current</v>

660
00:41:48.981 --> 00:41:53.981
<v Speaker 1>state description of the ideal future</v>
<v Speaker 1>state and the description of means of</v>

661
00:41:55.521 --> 00:41:56.390
<v Speaker 1>transformation.</v>

662
00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:16.780
<v Speaker 1>You run a fantasy of the sort of three</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have a plan,</v>

663
00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:21.270
<v Speaker 1>a plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's relevant to something you</v>

664
00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:24.640
<v Speaker 1>termination of action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just want to go down to the corner</v>

665
00:42:24.641 --> 00:42:26.230
<v Speaker 1>store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a loaf of bread.</v>

666
00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:31.870
<v Speaker 1>You can see above yourself here as</v>
<v Speaker 1>lacking something necessary,</v>

667
00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:36.460
<v Speaker 1>apprehended in the abstract and an ideal</v>
<v Speaker 1>goal,</v>

668
00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:41.200
<v Speaker 1>which is your trip down to the store and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you also formulating plans of how to get</v>

669
00:42:41.201 --> 00:42:43.090
<v Speaker 1>there and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

670
00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:48.110
<v Speaker 1>you valuate oh occurrences on the way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this store in relationship to two year</v>

671
00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:52.990
<v Speaker 1>idealized future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to say that anything that gets in</v>

672
00:42:52.991 --> 00:42:54.950
<v Speaker 1>your way basically on the way to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>store,</v>

673
00:42:54.951 --> 00:42:58.270
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a hurry for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's regarded as an inconvenience.</v>

674
00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.770
<v Speaker 1>Anything that hurries you along?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

675
00:42:59.771 --> 00:43:03.850
<v Speaker 1>regarded it as something positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just basically to say that you use your</v>

676
00:43:03.851 --> 00:43:07.390
<v Speaker 1>apprehension of the ideal future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is always construed in</v>

677
00:43:07.391 --> 00:43:12.391
<v Speaker 1>relationship to your present conditions</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the Schema by which you determine the</v>

678
00:43:12.611 --> 00:43:17.200
<v Speaker 1>significance of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're always construing the</v>

679
00:43:17.201 --> 00:43:21.010
<v Speaker 1>meaning of things in relationship to</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want to do in relationship to</v>

680
00:43:21.011 --> 00:43:24.040
<v Speaker 1>this function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this basically constitutes the</v>

681
00:43:24.041 --> 00:43:26.940
<v Speaker 1>whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole story in a sense,</v>

682
00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:29.110
<v Speaker 1>at least the simple version of it.</v>

683
00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:43.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me just stop there for a second.</v>

684
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:47.570
<v Speaker 1>Ask people questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then next thing I want to do is give</v>

685
00:43:47.571 --> 00:43:52.571
<v Speaker 1>you a really brief overview of how your</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain determines how things should be</v>

686
00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:57.770
<v Speaker 1>evaluated in terms of their emotional</v>
<v Speaker 1>relevance.</v>

687
00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:00.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does anybody have any questions so far</v>

688
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:05.260
<v Speaker 1>on the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quality,</v>

689
00:44:05.261 --> 00:44:07.190
<v Speaker 1>you put up a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the,</v>

690
00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:08.990
<v Speaker 1>the ring then the Naccho though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

691
00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:09.980
<v Speaker 1>the gang run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

692
00:44:09.981 --> 00:44:12.380
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the bring the neck of the right or</v>

693
00:44:12.381 --> 00:44:14.150
<v Speaker 1>wring the neck of the people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>under the,</v>

694
00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:15.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under the federation.</v>

695
00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:18.680
<v Speaker 1>It was the cup like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that poem was it.</v>

696
00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:24.130
<v Speaker 1>It's by a poet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think his name was [inaudible] sst of</v>

697
00:44:24.131 --> 00:44:27.550
<v Speaker 1>eliminating descent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like there's this,</v>

698
00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:29.760
<v Speaker 1>you could think the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

699
00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:31.860
<v Speaker 1>ran on a number of five year plans,</v>

700
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:34.620
<v Speaker 2>five year plans where we're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are here,</v>

701
00:44:34.621 --> 00:44:38.130
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get to here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here are the means by which that's going</v>

702
00:44:38.131 --> 00:44:41.770
<v Speaker 2>to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then anybody who was viewed as deviated</v>

703
00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:42.900
<v Speaker 2>from that plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

704
00:44:42.901 --> 00:44:46.800
<v Speaker 2>was instantly regarded as a threat and</v>
<v Speaker 2>my costs in the same luck,</v>

705
00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:48.200
<v Speaker 2>those are the gang run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

706
00:44:48.201 --> 00:44:51.660
<v Speaker 2>And fundamentally anybody who doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>agree with the forward portion of the</v>

707
00:44:51.661 --> 00:44:54.950
<v Speaker 2>current society instantly regarded well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're instantly regardless,</v>

708
00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:59.040
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally hasn't it normally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more pragmatically as a threat.</v>

709
00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:01.740
<v Speaker 2>And my costco was making the point that</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people,</v>

710
00:45:01.741 --> 00:45:04.730
<v Speaker 2>they should be eliminated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They deserve to be eliminated,</v>

711
00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:05.461
<v Speaker 2>which is even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

712
00:45:05.461 --> 00:45:10.461
<v Speaker 2>even a further step in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they constitute the class of things that</v>

713
00:45:11.071 --> 00:45:15.840
<v Speaker 2>deserves to be annihilated because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>construed in relationship to some ideal.</v>

714
00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:18.360
<v Speaker 2>At the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might be wondering,</v>

715
00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:21.360
<v Speaker 2>why the hell was this a story?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does this have to do with the</v>

716
00:45:21.361 --> 00:45:22.920
<v Speaker 2>story?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While I can give you the most,</v>

717
00:45:22.921 --> 00:45:25.080
<v Speaker 2>the most fundamental example of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>census.</v>

718
00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:29.790
<v Speaker 2>I want to tell you what stories are and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I want to take a look at their</v>

719
00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:30.840
<v Speaker 2>substructure.</v>

720
00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:33.243
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

721
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:37.190
<v Speaker 2>the fact that there's a substructure to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stories as evidence in the number of</v>

722
00:45:37.191 --> 00:45:39.500
<v Speaker 2>subtle ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's part of the epidemic because</v>

723
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:44.720
<v Speaker 2>myths that have been collected</v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout the world have a remarkably</v>

724
00:45:44.721 --> 00:45:47.040
<v Speaker 2>similar nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one,</v>

725
00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:50.900
<v Speaker 2>one bit of information that's relatively</v>
<v Speaker 2>curious.</v>

726
00:45:50.901 --> 00:45:53.450
<v Speaker 2>It's also very strange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the people like stories.</v>

727
00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:57.620
<v Speaker 2>Children will listen to stories and come</v>
<v Speaker 2>to any external reinforcement.</v>

728
00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:02.240
<v Speaker 2>They're intrinsically rewarding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People Watch tv all the time because TV</v>

729
00:46:02.241 --> 00:46:05.270
<v Speaker 2>is full of stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We pay to go see movies more by normals,</v>

730
00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:08.330
<v Speaker 2>but something about stories that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>intrinsically attractive to the point</v>

731
00:46:08.331 --> 00:46:11.020
<v Speaker 2>that will actually work to be allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming,</v>

732
00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:13.610
<v Speaker 2>to be in contact with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which should beg the question.</v>

733
00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:16.010
<v Speaker 2>Since we're willing to go to all that</v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble,</v>

734
00:46:16.011 --> 00:46:18.800
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to look at stories and to receive them,</v>

735
00:46:18.801 --> 00:46:21.020
<v Speaker 2>perhaps they're actually serving some</v>
<v Speaker 2>function.</v>

736
00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:24.500
<v Speaker 2>It seemed at least at least reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the function.</v>

737
00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:29.510
<v Speaker 2>There's certainly</v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

738
00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Good story is what regulates your</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions.</v>

739
00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:34.370
<v Speaker 2>And if you share a story with someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>

740
00:46:34.371 --> 00:46:37.940
<v Speaker 2>then you can predict them and both your</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions are making a group of you share</v>

741
00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:40.200
<v Speaker 2>the store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have the culture and you're all</v>

742
00:46:40.201 --> 00:46:43.280
<v Speaker 2>more or less predictable to one another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very useful because then you can</v>

743
00:46:43.281 --> 00:46:46.190
<v Speaker 2>be organized and you could move forward</v>
<v Speaker 2>in one direction and so on.</v>

744
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:49.800
<v Speaker 2>But most of your predictable tomorrow</v>
<v Speaker 2>say</v>

745
00:46:52.570 --> 00:46:55.580
<v Speaker 2>shoe to make the story aspect of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>more comprehensible.</v>

746
00:46:56.450 --> 00:46:58.850
<v Speaker 2>You might think of this as political</v>
<v Speaker 2>utopia.</v>

747
00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:02.600
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of doing it or as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>vision of paradise.</v>

748
00:47:02.810 --> 00:47:07.810
<v Speaker 2>And then that's the archetypical aspect</v>
<v Speaker 2>of underlies the notion that the future</v>

749
00:47:08.031 --> 00:47:09.920
<v Speaker 2>could in fact be better than the</v>
<v Speaker 2>present.</v>

750
00:47:10.310 --> 00:47:12.230
<v Speaker 2>Even in trivial waste.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're doing this all the time.</v>

751
00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:16.940
<v Speaker 2>We're always moving from a state that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>can see them as not entirely ideal</v>

752
00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:19.100
<v Speaker 2>towards a state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we can see them even in the</v>

753
00:47:19.101 --> 00:47:21.860
<v Speaker 2>smallest ways as somehow better than</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we work.</v>

754
00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:25.470
<v Speaker 2>And that's the sort of thing in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gives us the impetus to move forward in</v>

755
00:47:25.471 --> 00:47:26.600
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a literal sense.</v>

756
00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:31.900
<v Speaker 2>But underlying that is the notion way</v>
<v Speaker 2>under so to speak is the notion that the</v>

757
00:47:32.051 --> 00:47:36.970
<v Speaker 2>world as it is presently constructed is</v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow we needed redemption and there</v>

758
00:47:36.971 --> 00:47:40.930
<v Speaker 2>is a state hypothetical state that</v>
<v Speaker 2>exists somewhere in the future,</v>

759
00:47:40.931 --> 00:47:43.630
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or somewhere at least towards which the</v>

760
00:47:43.631 --> 00:47:46.360
<v Speaker 2>world could move in all religious</v>
<v Speaker 2>stories,</v>

761
00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:49.720
<v Speaker 2>all religious systems share that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>notion of clinical that you told use as</v>

762
00:47:49.721 --> 00:47:49.900
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

763
00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:52.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's really evident in the case</v>
<v Speaker 2>of something like,</v>

764
00:47:52.361 --> 00:47:53.400
<v Speaker 2>Connie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is call me.</v>

765
00:47:53.401 --> 00:47:58.401
<v Speaker 2>This was always trying to establish</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Kingdom of God on earth,</v>

766
00:47:58.481 --> 00:48:01.090
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although of course without theoretically</v>

767
00:48:01.091 --> 00:48:06.010
<v Speaker 2>without the religious overtones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it of course we've just made implicit</v>

768
00:48:06.011 --> 00:48:08.380
<v Speaker 2>instead of instead of being allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

769
00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:12.850
<v Speaker 2>to be explicit because Stellan was as</v>
<v Speaker 2>close to a god and a pretty miserable</v>

770
00:48:12.851 --> 00:48:17.470
<v Speaker 2>one is any religion hasn't managed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>construct.</v>

771
00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:21.190
<v Speaker 2>This isn't a simple story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically stories have a slightly more</v>

772
00:48:21.191 --> 00:48:23.560
<v Speaker 2>complicated structure than this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we'll discuss later.</v>

773
00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:28.470
<v Speaker 2>How would you distinguish or how do you</v>
<v Speaker 2>distinguish between the strategy and the</v>

774
00:48:28.471 --> 00:48:32.260
<v Speaker 2>story?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This would be a strategy in here.</v>

775
00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:34.930
<v Speaker 2>A strategy is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>

776
00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:39.280
<v Speaker 2>This is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is somewhat simpler then the real</v>

777
00:48:39.281 --> 00:48:44.260
<v Speaker 2>structure because in a sense each of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these strategies is this whole structure</v>

778
00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:47.380
<v Speaker 2>in a smaller sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could say this structure is</v>

779
00:48:47.381 --> 00:48:51.250
<v Speaker 2>composed of smaller units like this all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way down and I don't know how far</v>

780
00:48:51.251 --> 00:48:55.090
<v Speaker 2>down I'm being able to figure that out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like because every goal can be</v>

781
00:48:55.091 --> 00:48:59.800
<v Speaker 2>conceptualized as viewed of sub goals</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have the same notion for for the</v>

782
00:48:59.801 --> 00:49:01.390
<v Speaker 2>purposes of the present discussion.</v>

783
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:04.360
<v Speaker 2>This is a sufficient sufficient</v>
<v Speaker 2>representation,</v>

784
00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:09.160
<v Speaker 2>but that's something will that specific</v>
<v Speaker 2>issue we'll talk about more in the</v>

785
00:49:09.161 --> 00:49:14.161
<v Speaker 2>latter part of the latter part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>course because the fact that a story is</v>

786
00:49:14.891 --> 00:49:19.030
<v Speaker 2>made up of sub stories right down to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>lowest level of resolution has</v>

787
00:49:19.031 --> 00:49:23.230
<v Speaker 2>implications for all for certain forms</v>
<v Speaker 2>of mythological representations,</v>

788
00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:28.060
<v Speaker 2>representations of trees actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing and want to get into that at the</v>

789
00:49:28.061 --> 00:49:30.870
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

790
00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:33.240
<v Speaker 2>that's the story you said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put up there the domain and</v>

791
00:49:33.241 --> 00:49:35.580
<v Speaker 2>constituent elements of the known what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pay for,</v>

792
00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:37.270
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want a title for our diagram</v>

793
00:49:37.271 --> 00:49:38.950
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would say that from the</v>

794
00:49:38.951 --> 00:49:41.170
<v Speaker 2>perspective of the regulation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion,</v>

795
00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:44.670
<v Speaker 2>a story about where you are and where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd like to get to and how are you</v>

796
00:49:44.671 --> 00:49:46.660
<v Speaker 2>going to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is what you know,</v>

797
00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:49.330
<v Speaker 2>just remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not in the domain of facts here</v>

798
00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:51.910
<v Speaker 2>construed from the scientific</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>

799
00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:55.600
<v Speaker 2>We're in the domain of wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavioral knowledge and what you know</v>

800
00:49:55.601 --> 00:49:58.150
<v Speaker 2>is where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you want to be,</v>

801
00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.710
<v Speaker 2>and theoretically how to get there.</v>

802
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:05.530
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll explain this in some more detail</v>

803
00:50:05.531 --> 00:50:09.430
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

804
00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:12.513
<v Speaker 1>Oh sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

805
00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:17.880
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

806
00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:20.200
<v Speaker 1>So I said the first thing we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

807
00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:29.400
<v Speaker 2>it's described in some detail how the</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain works and I want to do that</v>

808
00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:33.710
<v Speaker 2>because I want to give you some insight</v>
<v Speaker 2>into how it is that we processed the</v>

809
00:50:33.711 --> 00:50:36.620
<v Speaker 2>multiple information and you need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

810
00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:39.920
<v Speaker 2>and we think in stories before you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually understand how it is that we</v>

811
00:50:39.921 --> 00:50:44.240
<v Speaker 2>processing emotional information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to put up a somewhat</v>

812
00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:48.350
<v Speaker 2>complicated diagram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your number basically that it will take</v>

813
00:50:48.351 --> 00:50:51.610
<v Speaker 2>three weeks to discuss this case</v>
<v Speaker 2>briefing,</v>

814
00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.370
<v Speaker 2>but here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the ideal.</v>

815
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:57.630
<v Speaker 2>It's not as complicated as it looks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

816
00:50:57.650 --> 00:51:01.940
<v Speaker 2>At the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this is a circle but and you can</v>

817
00:51:01.941 --> 00:51:04.850
<v Speaker 2>start anywhere in a circle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we'll start at the top is how you</v>

818
00:51:04.851 --> 00:51:08.900
<v Speaker 2>process information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously the bottom line is if you have</v>

819
00:51:08.901 --> 00:51:09.810
<v Speaker 2>a certain road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spencer,</v>

820
00:51:09.811 --> 00:51:10.644
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

821
00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:12.083
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

822
00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:21.010
<v Speaker 2>That seems where you input is</v>
<v Speaker 2>interpreted with regards to a</v>

823
00:51:21.011 --> 00:51:26.011
<v Speaker 2>significance as a consequence of its</v>
<v Speaker 2>interaction with what you already know,</v>

824
00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:29.270
<v Speaker 2>which is basically to say that your</v>
<v Speaker 2>presence,</v>

825
00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:33.680
<v Speaker 2>which is which constitutes the sensory</v>
<v Speaker 2>information you ready for you to Tim</v>

826
00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:38.700
<v Speaker 2>pinching on you at this moment is not a</v>
<v Speaker 2>vertical picture of the external world,</v>

827
00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:41.740
<v Speaker 2>but your interpretation of reality as</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's unfolding.</v>

828
00:51:42.070 --> 00:51:45.370
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not saying I'm not trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make a point that there no such thing as</v>

829
00:51:45.371 --> 00:51:48.760
<v Speaker 2>an external reality or that you living</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a delusion or any of those things,</v>

830
00:51:48.761 --> 00:51:52.870
<v Speaker 2>just that you're always interpreting</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on in relationship to its</v>

831
00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:56.810
<v Speaker 2>significance to you and you have models,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some models.</v>

832
00:51:56.830 --> 00:51:59.440
<v Speaker 2>Then you're doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have theories about what someone's</v>

833
00:51:59.441 --> 00:52:01.390
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're like and what the situation</v>

834
00:52:01.391 --> 00:52:03.150
<v Speaker 2>consists of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you should be doing next.</v>

835
00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:05.500
<v Speaker 2>If all of the input did you have with</v>
<v Speaker 2>prostitutes,</v>

836
00:52:05.501 --> 00:52:08.280
<v Speaker 2>your online experience is a function of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your interpretation.</v>

837
00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:11.260
<v Speaker 2>It's based on actual information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's still a function of</v>

838
00:52:11.261 --> 00:52:12.940
<v Speaker 2>interpretations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

839
00:52:13.090 --> 00:52:14.650
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll use your declarative memory.</v>

840
00:52:14.651 --> 00:52:18.280
<v Speaker 2>That's one form of memory storage to</v>
<v Speaker 2>construct your version of the present.</v>

841
00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:22.990
<v Speaker 2>That's the significance of things as</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're unfolding at the present time,</v>

842
00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:28.060
<v Speaker 2>and you can only really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can only really make judgments about</v>

843
00:52:28.061 --> 00:52:32.440
<v Speaker 2>the significance of things by contrast</v>
<v Speaker 2>with what you would like to happen.</v>

844
00:52:33.490 --> 00:52:36.040
<v Speaker 2>That's your image of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have the desired future.</v>

845
00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:37.930
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>

846
00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:41.530
<v Speaker 2>if you're doing something this evening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very simple,</v>

847
00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:46.720
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me give you an example.</v>

848
00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:53.220
<v Speaker 2>There are experiments where people's</v>
<v Speaker 2>task is to pick up an object and you</v>

849
00:52:54.551 --> 00:52:56.860
<v Speaker 2>could see the object in front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

850
00:52:56.890 --> 00:52:59.140
<v Speaker 2>so you're giving the tasks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the basic story.</v>

851
00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:04.560
<v Speaker 2>The story is what you're required to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to transform yourself from the person</v>

852
00:53:05.171 --> 00:53:09.910
<v Speaker 2>you are now into the person who has</v>
<v Speaker 2>possession of the watch.</v>

853
00:53:09.970 --> 00:53:11.890
<v Speaker 2>It's just the standard laboratory</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment,</v>

854
00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:17.140
<v Speaker 2>but the watch is actually there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an image that's generated by</v>

855
00:53:17.141 --> 00:53:19.810
<v Speaker 2>mirrors and when you move towards the</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch,</v>

856
00:53:19.811 --> 00:53:21.850
<v Speaker 2>you find that it's not where it appears</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be.</v>

857
00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:26.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact of object not being where it</v>

858
00:53:26.821 --> 00:53:31.821
<v Speaker 2>appears to be is an anomaly with regards</v>
<v Speaker 2>to your current plan and you'll react to</v>

859
00:53:32.671 --> 00:53:35.070
<v Speaker 2>that emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first thing that'll happen is that</v>

860
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:37.710
<v Speaker 2>obviously you're going to be surprised,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

861
00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:40.650
<v Speaker 2>You think this is pretty easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to pick that up and you find</v>

862
00:53:40.651 --> 00:53:42.960
<v Speaker 2>out that the thing that you see is no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually there.</v>

863
00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:47.850
<v Speaker 2>That's an anomaly you contrast and your</v>
<v Speaker 2>desired future,</v>

864
00:53:47.851 --> 00:53:52.350
<v Speaker 2>which was your aim when you moved your</v>
<v Speaker 2>arm with the actual outcome of your</v>

865
00:53:52.351 --> 00:53:53.184
<v Speaker 2>actions.</v>

866
00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:57.720
<v Speaker 2>That's a mismatch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So part of your brain called the</v>

867
00:53:57.721 --> 00:54:02.721
<v Speaker 2>hippocampus that seems to be responsible</v>
<v Speaker 2>for comparing what's actually going on</v>

868
00:54:03.961 --> 00:54:08.160
<v Speaker 2>in so far as you can interpret that with</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you want to happen and if,</v>

869
00:54:08.490 --> 00:54:12.810
<v Speaker 2>if a mismatch occurs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sets up a whole sequence of related</v>

870
00:54:12.811 --> 00:54:17.790
<v Speaker 2>events and those events manifest</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves in emotion and in thought and</v>

871
00:54:17.791 --> 00:54:22.140
<v Speaker 2>in behavior most evidently and emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to do something,</v>

872
00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:25.710
<v Speaker 2>you've done it before and it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>work out the way you expected it to.</v>

873
00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:30.240
<v Speaker 2>The events that constitute the anomaly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the unexpected occurrence there are</v>

874
00:54:30.250 --> 00:54:32.970
<v Speaker 2>surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the question then is what does</v>

875
00:54:32.971 --> 00:54:34.680
<v Speaker 2>surprising me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

876
00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:40.280
<v Speaker 2>it basically means that</v>
<v Speaker 2>something threatening as occurred and</v>

877
00:54:40.681 --> 00:54:44.680
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that moon is taking place.</v>

878
00:54:44.681 --> 00:54:46.350
<v Speaker 2>And what does the unknown mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

879
00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:48.900
<v Speaker 2>the thing about the unknown is that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know what it means.</v>

880
00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:51.660
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a pretty straightforward statement,</v>

881
00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:53.850
<v Speaker 2>but you see that immediately.</v>

882
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.920
<v Speaker 2>That immediately introduces this strange</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of paradox because you lacked</v>

883
00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:02.190
<v Speaker 2>infinite information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously people don't know what they're</v>

884
00:55:02.191 --> 00:55:04.710
<v Speaker 2>doing all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means that you come into contact</v>

885
00:55:04.711 --> 00:55:06.450
<v Speaker 2>with things that you'd want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the law.</v>

886
00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:11.520
<v Speaker 2>And that means in the sense that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to know what to do when you don't</v>

887
00:55:11.521 --> 00:55:15.990
<v Speaker 2>know what to do because you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>what to do a lot and that just doesn't</v>

888
00:55:15.991 --> 00:55:20.130
<v Speaker 2>just bring into a hall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the case that your nervous</v>

889
00:55:20.131 --> 00:55:25.131
<v Speaker 2>system is hardwired to move to a sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>default position when the plans that the</v>

890
00:55:25.650 --> 00:55:28.410
<v Speaker 2>explicit plan is that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're carrying out fail.</v>

891
00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:31.830
<v Speaker 2>So as long as you could say in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as you know what you're doing,</v>

892
00:55:31.890 --> 00:55:35.280
<v Speaker 2>which means that you have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>representation of where you are and</v>

893
00:55:35.281 --> 00:55:38.040
<v Speaker 2>where you'd like to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're carrying out your plans to make</v>

894
00:55:38.041 --> 00:55:40.680
<v Speaker 2>the move and things are going according</v>
<v Speaker 2>to plan.</v>

895
00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:44.640
<v Speaker 2>As long as you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the higher centers in your,</v>

896
00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:47.460
<v Speaker 2>of your brain and the cortex basically</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's under control.</v>

897
00:55:48.330 --> 00:55:51.240
<v Speaker 2>You know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you feel comfortable and secure as</v>

898
00:55:51.241 --> 00:55:55.830
<v Speaker 2>soon as something unexpected happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the control shifts and this is something</v>

899
00:55:55.831 --> 00:55:58.960
<v Speaker 2>that basically beyond your capacity to</v>
<v Speaker 2>control,</v>

900
00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:03.360
<v Speaker 2>well you can interfere with the process</v>
<v Speaker 2>control shifts from the cortical centers</v>

901
00:56:03.570 --> 00:56:05.250
<v Speaker 2>to the more fundamental areas of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>

902
00:56:05.251 --> 00:56:08.430
<v Speaker 2>To the limbic system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When something unexpected happens,</v>

903
00:56:08.431 --> 00:56:09.870
<v Speaker 2>two things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bowker,</v>

904
00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:13.110
<v Speaker 2>you stop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll feel a little bit of anxiety and</v>

905
00:56:13.111 --> 00:56:16.290
<v Speaker 2>it's not unexpected you occurrences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really unexpected.</v>

906
00:56:16.291 --> 00:56:18.780
<v Speaker 2>You will be very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very frightened because just minor</v>

907
00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:20.310
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>minor league,</v>

908
00:56:20.311 --> 00:56:22.020
<v Speaker 2>unexpected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll just stop.</v>

909
00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:27.160
<v Speaker 2>Your sensory processing will heighten,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll gather more information and</v>

910
00:56:27.161 --> 00:56:30.940
<v Speaker 2>you'll explore and as you explore the</v>
<v Speaker 2>generate information and the information</v>

911
00:56:30.941 --> 00:56:32.890
<v Speaker 2>is supposed to bring me back on course</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>

912
00:56:32.890 --> 00:56:37.890
<v Speaker 2>So you'll say</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you'll do if you're trying to reach</v>

913
00:56:37.931 --> 00:56:40.680
<v Speaker 2>for the watch and you can find out that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't where you taking this call,</v>

914
00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:44.230
<v Speaker 2>you'll start making different sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>approach sequences until you end up</v>

915
00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:46.210
<v Speaker 2>producing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now tell me that you intended</v>

916
00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:51.230
<v Speaker 2>when something unexpected occurs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two sets of circuitry,</v>

917
00:56:51.231 --> 00:56:53.770
<v Speaker 2>you're activated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One looks like it's dominated by the</v>

918
00:56:53.771 --> 00:56:56.320
<v Speaker 2>right hand to secure the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like it's dominated by the left</v>

919
00:56:56.321 --> 00:57:00.760
<v Speaker 2>hemisphere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unexpected things make you anxious and</v>

920
00:57:00.761 --> 00:57:04.810
<v Speaker 2>curious and you've been localize those</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions in the body,</v>

921
00:57:04.811 --> 00:57:08.590
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anxiety is the emotion that a company is</v>

922
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:13.570
<v Speaker 2>the cessation of your body's plan</v>
<v Speaker 2>directed activities.</v>

923
00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:16.750
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's you could say that anxiety is</v>

924
00:57:16.751 --> 00:57:18.670
<v Speaker 2>what you feel when you slipped into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>motive.</v>

925
00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:21.040
<v Speaker 2>Pause,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pause for further analysis.</v>

926
00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:23.890
<v Speaker 2>What do you expect it to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give you a copy so you have to stop.</v>

927
00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:28.960
<v Speaker 2>Curiosity is what you feel when it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary for you to explore further,</v>

928
00:57:28.961 --> 00:57:33.040
<v Speaker 2>to gather new information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to update your plans and exploration is</v>

929
00:57:33.041 --> 00:57:36.180
<v Speaker 2>basically governed by the interplay of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the circuitry brain circuitry that</v>

930
00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:39.220
<v Speaker 2>mediates anxiety and curiosity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Curiosity,</v>

931
00:57:39.221 --> 00:57:41.020
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now it's associated with positive</v>

932
00:57:41.021 --> 00:57:43.450
<v Speaker 2>emotions and anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you all know.</v>

933
00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:46.630
<v Speaker 2>Those associated with to negative people</v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting people would rather do I</v>

934
00:57:46.631 --> 00:57:48.670
<v Speaker 2>experience it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Curiosity of course.</v>

935
00:57:48.671 --> 00:57:53.200
<v Speaker 2>Surprise is basically a juxtaposition of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those two sets of emotions which work</v>

936
00:57:53.201 --> 00:57:56.590
<v Speaker 2>antagonistically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The unknown produces coin flipped all by</v>

937
00:57:56.591 --> 00:57:57.650
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's thick.</v>

938
00:57:57.750 --> 00:58:01.420
<v Speaker 2>It's in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of early to introduce this,</v>

939
00:58:01.421 --> 00:58:06.421
<v Speaker 2>but that's the central theme in a way of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole course is that you have a hard</v>

940
00:58:07.721 --> 00:58:11.130
<v Speaker 2>wired response to the emergence of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>unexpected.</v>

941
00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:13.730
<v Speaker 2>You have to because they have to know</v>
<v Speaker 2>what to do with something unexpected</v>

942
00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:15.310
<v Speaker 2>trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's instinct.</v>

943
00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:17.830
<v Speaker 2>Your instinct of response to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown.</v>

944
00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:22.990
<v Speaker 2>Anxiety plus curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to say cessation of ongoing</v>

945
00:58:22.991 --> 00:58:27.220
<v Speaker 2>motor activity plus a drive to move</v>
<v Speaker 2>forward and explore and your exploratory</v>

946
00:58:27.221 --> 00:58:29.950
<v Speaker 2>activities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually the sum total of the activation</v>

947
00:58:30.220 --> 00:58:34.510
<v Speaker 2>of the two sets of circuitry that</v>
<v Speaker 2>mediate that response and when you</v>

948
00:58:34.511 --> 00:58:36.070
<v Speaker 2>explore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you explore,</v>

949
00:58:36.290 --> 00:58:38.380
<v Speaker 2>if something unexpected happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to explore,</v>

950
00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:40.420
<v Speaker 2>you can note it and get the hell out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

951
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:43.240
<v Speaker 2>It's safe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't get them any new</v>

952
00:58:43.241 --> 00:58:45.460
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good short term strategy.</v>

953
00:58:45.461 --> 00:58:47.410
<v Speaker 2>It's not a good long term strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyways,</v>

954
00:58:47.411 --> 00:58:49.720
<v Speaker 2>the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that surprise,</v>

955
00:58:50.550 --> 00:58:53.860
<v Speaker 2>it's curiosity and it tells you 40</v>
<v Speaker 2>generate new information,</v>

956
00:58:53.861 --> 00:58:56.070
<v Speaker 2>you update your plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as soon you can get to her,</v>

957
00:58:56.090 --> 00:59:01.090
<v Speaker 2>you want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point is the mismatch between what</v>

958
00:59:01.331 --> 00:59:03.460
<v Speaker 2>you expect to happen and what actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>

959
00:59:03.810 --> 00:59:05.370
<v Speaker 2>That disc inhibits thing side.</v>

960
00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:07.453
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

961
00:59:12.670 --> 00:59:16.340
<v Speaker 2>If mismatch occurs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a little sub organ in your brain</v>

962
00:59:16.341 --> 00:59:20.390
<v Speaker 2>called the Amygdala and you made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like it's responsible for the</v>

963
00:59:20.810 --> 00:59:23.720
<v Speaker 2>addition of emotion to sensory</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

964
00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:27.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Behavioral psychologists have presumed</v>

965
00:59:27.561 --> 00:59:31.850
<v Speaker 2>in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most psychologists presume particularly</v>

966
00:59:31.851 --> 00:59:36.851
<v Speaker 2>behaviors that you learned to be afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Newer models of the neuropsychology of</v>

967
00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:42.770
<v Speaker 2>volition reversed that precept position</v>
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>

968
00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:46.010
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know how to be afraid.</v>

969
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:49.730
<v Speaker 2>Anything that you don't expect makes you</v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid.</v>

970
00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:54.410
<v Speaker 2>That's your default position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you have to learn is how to be</v>

971
00:59:54.411 --> 00:59:56.100
<v Speaker 2>secure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

972
00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:59.120
<v Speaker 2>by the time you're an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've learned how to be secure so well</v>

973
00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:02.630
<v Speaker 2>under most circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>under secure circumstances,</v>

974
01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:06.110
<v Speaker 2>you've learned how to be secure so well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you don't realize that you're a</v>

975
01:00:06.111 --> 01:00:09.320
<v Speaker 2>priority or default position is fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're coming,</v>

976
01:00:09.321 --> 01:00:12.620
<v Speaker 2>you're so well inculturated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>assuming you're successful.</v>

977
01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:18.290
<v Speaker 2>That's the true nature of your emotional</v>
<v Speaker 2>responses in is in a sense hidden from</v>

978
01:00:18.291 --> 01:00:20.840
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is precisely as it's supposed to</v>

979
01:00:20.841 --> 01:00:22.910
<v Speaker 2>be because the whole purpose of</v>
<v Speaker 2>socialization,</v>

980
01:00:22.911 --> 01:00:27.680
<v Speaker 2>the whole purpose of learning is in fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>to shut off the circuitry that says</v>

981
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:31.040
<v Speaker 2>something of indeterminant significance</v>
<v Speaker 2>is occurring now.</v>

982
01:00:31.310 --> 01:00:32.570
<v Speaker 2>People do not like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will not.</v>

983
01:00:32.571 --> 01:00:34.390
<v Speaker 2>Certain three is accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't not,</v>

984
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:39.430
<v Speaker 2>not it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a fit in the air because people</v>

985
01:00:39.771 --> 01:00:42.500
<v Speaker 2>like to explore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like novelty in small doses,</v>

986
01:00:42.501 --> 01:00:45.290
<v Speaker 2>small controllable doses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like food.</v>

987
01:00:45.830 --> 01:00:49.760
<v Speaker 2>It's when something truly unexpected</v>
<v Speaker 2>occurs that up roots or upsets your</v>

988
01:00:49.761 --> 01:00:51.950
<v Speaker 2>plans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that anxiety really becomes</v>

989
01:00:51.951 --> 01:00:54.080
<v Speaker 2>disinhibited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People like that less than anything</v>

990
01:00:54.081 --> 01:00:54.914
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

991
01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:00.530
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Amygdala labels things that are</v>

992
01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:03.950
<v Speaker 2>unexpected as simultaneous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that threatening and promised,</v>

993
01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:05.690
<v Speaker 2>that basically puts you into an</v>
<v Speaker 2>approach.</v>

994
01:01:05.691 --> 01:01:10.691
<v Speaker 2>Avoidance conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what does that mean?</v>

995
01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:16.910
<v Speaker 2>It means that anything unpredictable is</v>
<v Speaker 2>not neutral.</v>

996
01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:22.870
<v Speaker 2>Anything unpredictable was frightened</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that in and of itself immediately</v>

997
01:01:23.751 --> 01:01:28.751
<v Speaker 2>she has a certain amount of life of why</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that we're somewhat low to accept</v>

998
01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:35.170
<v Speaker 2>people whose behaviors we can't predict</v>
<v Speaker 2>it as one of us people who are from a</v>

999
01:01:35.271 --> 01:01:37.400
<v Speaker 2>culture that's different from ours for</v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

1000
01:01:37.401 --> 01:01:41.270
<v Speaker 2>who have a story about how things should</v>
<v Speaker 2>go that runs differently from ours.</v>

1001
01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:44.900
<v Speaker 2>Their behavior cannot be predicted with</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainty and you,</v>

1002
01:01:45.210 --> 01:01:48.020
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are instinctively wired so to speak,</v>

1003
01:01:48.021 --> 01:01:51.250
<v Speaker 2>to label unpredictable behavior as</v>
<v Speaker 2>threatened.</v>

1004
01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:54.770
<v Speaker 2>And I think you can think about this in</v>
<v Speaker 2>really concrete terms and you can</v>

1005
01:01:54.771 --> 01:01:57.590
<v Speaker 2>experience this sort of thing regularly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

1006
01:01:57.591 --> 01:02:01.150
<v Speaker 2>on a stroll through Harvard Yard in</v>
<v Speaker 2>north.</v>

1007
01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:05.000
<v Speaker 2>Like if you look around you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're all decked out in symbols.</v>

1008
01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:09.380
<v Speaker 2>So does that indicate here a particular</v>
<v Speaker 2>status?</v>

1009
01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:12.950
<v Speaker 2>And Gold direct nature in a community</v>
<v Speaker 2>such as this,</v>

1010
01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:16.280
<v Speaker 2>you're all relatively well dressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're all relatively,</v>

1011
01:02:16.750 --> 01:02:17.451
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1012
01:02:17.451 --> 01:02:19.210
<v Speaker 2>it's all it's intended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1013
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:23.400
<v Speaker 2>you're all weld grew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a tentative and your behavior is</v>

1014
01:02:23.401 --> 01:02:25.590
<v Speaker 2>very much indistinguishable from one</v>
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

1015
01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:27.930
<v Speaker 2>They're all participating in the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of ritual.</v>

1016
01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:30.480
<v Speaker 2>And then there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason for you to view your</v>

1017
01:02:30.481 --> 01:02:33.780
<v Speaker 2>neighbor's sitting beside you with any</v>
<v Speaker 2>degree of suspicion because you're</v>

1018
01:02:33.781 --> 01:02:36.510
<v Speaker 2>convinced that you can predict them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you take a walk through somewhere</v>

1019
01:02:36.511 --> 01:02:38.730
<v Speaker 2>like Harvard Square,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where there are people who in a sense</v>

1020
01:02:38.731 --> 01:02:41.550
<v Speaker 2>fallen out of the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are people there who were</v>

1021
01:02:41.551 --> 01:02:43.290
<v Speaker 2>mentally ill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them are schizophrenia,</v>

1022
01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:46.080
<v Speaker 2>many other miracle holic or homeless for</v>
<v Speaker 2>one reason or another.</v>

1023
01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:47.940
<v Speaker 2>They're hard on your guilt if nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>

1024
01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.590
<v Speaker 2>but they're also unpredictable.</v>

1025
01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:53.160
<v Speaker 2>And you find that people do standard</v>
<v Speaker 2>things in the face of unpredictable.</v>

1026
01:02:53.161 --> 01:02:54.720
<v Speaker 2>Others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tend to avoid them,</v>

1027
01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:57.420
<v Speaker 2>walk around them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or at least to feel very uncomfortable</v>

1028
01:02:57.421 --> 01:03:00.030
<v Speaker 2>in your presence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's because you do not know what</v>

1029
01:03:00.031 --> 01:03:04.980
<v Speaker 2>to do in the face of someone who's story</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cannot easily determine.</v>

1030
01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:07.170
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what they're like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know if they're going to hurt</v>

1031
01:03:07.171 --> 01:03:07.951
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know if they're,</v>

1032
01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:08.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're,</v>

1033
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.440
<v Speaker 2>if they're dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In some regards,</v>

1034
01:03:10.441 --> 01:03:12.900
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what your obligations are</v>
<v Speaker 2>with regards to them.</v>

1035
01:03:13.110 --> 01:03:15.720
<v Speaker 2>They're already labeled as part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown,</v>

1036
01:03:15.721 --> 01:03:18.210
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you'll give them a relatively wide</v>

1037
01:03:18.211 --> 01:03:19.044
<v Speaker 2>berth.</v>

1038
01:03:24.570 --> 01:03:25.403
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

1039
01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:31.390
<v Speaker 2>The only message that that's really</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary from this particular slide,</v>

1040
01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:37.220
<v Speaker 2>you're always contrast what you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen with what you think is that</v>

1041
01:03:37.650 --> 01:03:40.980
<v Speaker 2>they're both more and wherever there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>deviation,</v>

1042
01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:45.090
<v Speaker 2>wherever what you want to happen isn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on,</v>

1043
01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:49.080
<v Speaker 2>then you feel anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>curiosity as well here impelled to</v>

1044
01:03:49.081 --> 01:03:51.540
<v Speaker 2>explore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anxiety is the thing that comes up</v>

1045
01:03:51.541 --> 01:03:52.860
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the larger,</v>

1046
01:03:52.861 --> 01:03:55.410
<v Speaker 2>the magnitude of the unexpected</v>
<v Speaker 2>occurrence,</v>

1047
01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:58.530
<v Speaker 2>the greater the amount of anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things we're going to try to</v>

1048
01:03:58.531 --> 01:04:02.670
<v Speaker 2>determine in the courses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you can understand how large a</v>

1049
01:04:02.671 --> 01:04:06.270
<v Speaker 2>disruption a given unexpected event is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>

1050
01:04:06.271 --> 01:04:07.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>minor thing,</v>

1051
01:04:08.370 --> 01:04:10.220
<v Speaker 2>let's go back to the southern diner for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a second.</v>

1052
01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.680
<v Speaker 2>Here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a way of looking at it.</v>

1053
01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:15.810
<v Speaker 2>So let's say you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1054
01:04:15.811 --> 01:04:20.400
<v Speaker 2>you're going somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have three plans to get there and</v>

1055
01:04:20.730 --> 01:04:23.370
<v Speaker 2>this one doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that means it produces an outcome</v>

1056
01:04:23.371 --> 01:04:26.400
<v Speaker 2>that isn't what you envisioned and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>plan doesn't work.</v>

1057
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:29.880
<v Speaker 2>It produces a anomalous outcomes as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1058
01:04:29.881 --> 01:04:31.890
<v Speaker 2>but that plan doesn't work well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's no problem.</v>

1059
01:04:31.891 --> 01:04:33.660
<v Speaker 2>And he knows are pretty minor league</v>
<v Speaker 2>disruptions.</v>

1060
01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:38.340
<v Speaker 2>All you do is you keep the same vision</v>
<v Speaker 2>of yourself and the same vision of the</v>

1061
01:04:38.341 --> 01:04:40.740
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just switched between plants and</v>

1062
01:04:40.741 --> 01:04:45.741
<v Speaker 2>you're really in trouble if none of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>plans work or if someone messes around</v>

1063
01:04:47.191 --> 01:04:50.490
<v Speaker 2>with your representation of this or</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1064
01:04:51.690 --> 01:04:56.690
<v Speaker 2>So you can say for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to get into medical school and</v>

1065
01:04:57.001 --> 01:05:01.230
<v Speaker 2>you need 30 courses to get into medical</v>
<v Speaker 2>school and you should have a's on all of</v>

1066
01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:06.090
<v Speaker 2>them and you get a b plus on one course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1067
01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:07.680
<v Speaker 2>well you still have all these other</v>
<v Speaker 2>courses.</v>

1068
01:05:07.681 --> 01:05:10.170
<v Speaker 2>That's not such a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a minor league disruption that</v>

1069
01:05:10.171 --> 01:05:13.350
<v Speaker 2>causes you a certain amount of anxiety</v>
<v Speaker 2>and produces a certain amount of</v>

1070
01:05:13.351 --> 01:05:15.570
<v Speaker 2>exploratory behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps might go to the professor and</v>

1071
01:05:15.571 --> 01:05:17.810
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is it that I got this last one?</v>

1072
01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:20.550
<v Speaker 2>I was expecting a name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you know what that's going to do</v>

1073
01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:24.070
<v Speaker 2>that by positioning of the ideal future</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so on and so forth.</v>

1074
01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:26.440
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one sort of disruption.</v>

1075
01:05:26.441 --> 01:05:27.520
<v Speaker 2>You're a bit anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but hey,</v>

1076
01:05:27.521 --> 01:05:29.830
<v Speaker 2>you have 29 other courses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not such a big deal.</v>

1077
01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:35.040
<v Speaker 2>Now instead write damn cap and You score</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the 50th percentile.</v>

1078
01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:39.670
<v Speaker 2>Well now you're in trouble because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a vision of yourself.</v>

1079
01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:42.160
<v Speaker 2>You think this is your version of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbearable present.</v>

1080
01:05:42.370 --> 01:05:44.410
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a doctor that's a pain in the neck,</v>

1081
01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:47.740
<v Speaker 2>but you're a potential doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have the intellectual resources at</v>

1082
01:05:47.741 --> 01:05:50.710
<v Speaker 2>your disposal and the educational</v>
<v Speaker 2>background and,</v>

1083
01:05:50.711 --> 01:05:52.450
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the familial,</v>

1084
01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:57.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>push perhaps to make you into a doctor.</v>

1085
01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:00.490
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what you've conceived</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself as.</v>

1086
01:06:00.491 --> 01:06:02.050
<v Speaker 2>That's your story about yourself cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the,</v>

1087
01:06:02.110 --> 01:06:04.570
<v Speaker 2>this person with this set number of</v>
<v Speaker 2>potentials.</v>

1088
01:06:04.810 --> 01:06:07.030
<v Speaker 2>And you also have the visual of where it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you're going,</v>

1089
01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:08.920
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am cat score comes back and you're in</v>

1090
01:06:08.921 --> 01:06:09.970
<v Speaker 2>the 15th percentile.</v>

1091
01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:13.960
<v Speaker 2>Well your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your ideal future is gone.</v>

1092
01:06:14.890 --> 01:06:19.890
<v Speaker 2>That's a big problem because that means</v>
<v Speaker 2>that all of the events that have</v>

1093
01:06:19.961 --> 01:06:24.961
<v Speaker 2>surrounded you and surround you now and</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far back as you can remember that</v>

1094
01:06:25.271 --> 01:06:30.271
<v Speaker 2>were given determinant significance by</v>
<v Speaker 2>this particular plan have all been cast</v>

1095
01:06:30.281 --> 01:06:33.580
<v Speaker 2>into chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything that you've done up to that</v>

1096
01:06:33.581 --> 01:06:36.490
<v Speaker 2>point has been predicated on the notion</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is where you were going and</v>

1097
01:06:36.491 --> 01:06:40.240
<v Speaker 2>that means that the significance that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you attributed to everything was</v>

1098
01:06:40.241 --> 01:06:43.420
<v Speaker 2>attributed to everything in relationship</v>
<v Speaker 2>to that goal.</v>

1099
01:06:43.570 --> 01:06:47.290
<v Speaker 2>You blow out the goal and all those</v>
<v Speaker 2>significance or backup in the air.</v>

1100
01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:49.460
<v Speaker 2>We have to modify your version of</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

1101
01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:52.840
<v Speaker 2>Why the hell are you going to do now</v>
<v Speaker 2>they going to be a doctor,</v>

1102
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:55.960
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of work into this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus it's your whole self conception.</v>

1103
01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:57.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is gone.</v>

1104
01:06:58.330 --> 01:07:00.460
<v Speaker 2>This is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is irrelevant,</v>

1105
01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:02.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the other 29 courses,</v>

1106
01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:04.120
<v Speaker 2>why the hell are you even here now?</v>

1107
01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:11.250
<v Speaker 2>That's one example of the levels at</v>
<v Speaker 2>which anomalies can incur minor league</v>

1108
01:07:11.681 --> 01:07:12.700
<v Speaker 2>anomalies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No problem.</v>

1109
01:07:12.701 --> 01:07:14.710
<v Speaker 2>You just scoot around them and you go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same place,</v>

1110
01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:19.180
<v Speaker 2>major league anomalies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a new ideal future.</v>

1111
01:07:19.450 --> 01:07:22.810
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the reason that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are so prone to ideological conflicts.</v>

1112
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:28.190
<v Speaker 2>It's like this is an ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could say it has a particular</v>

1113
01:07:28.481 --> 01:07:30.780
<v Speaker 2>version of the way things are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Knowing a little bit communist ideology</v>

1114
01:07:30.781 --> 01:07:32.950
<v Speaker 2>is pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty explicit.</v>

1115
01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:35.440
<v Speaker 2>What's the unbearable present,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak?</v>

1116
01:07:35.441 --> 01:07:37.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know this is a bit dated,</v>

1117
01:07:37.751 --> 01:07:40.610
<v Speaker 2>but we're running out of the hardline</v>
<v Speaker 2>etiologies to co fund,</v>

1118
01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:43.030
<v Speaker 2>so I have to use an old one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1119
01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:47.380
<v Speaker 2>the unbearable present is the class</v>
<v Speaker 2>struggle and we have reasons for that.</v>

1120
01:07:47.381 --> 01:07:50.110
<v Speaker 2>It's basically the fault of the rich who</v>
<v Speaker 2>are exploiting the poor.</v>

1121
01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:55.560
<v Speaker 2>The ideal future is the point at which</v>
<v Speaker 2>those unfair divisions of capital are</v>

1122
01:07:55.751 --> 01:07:56.530
<v Speaker 2>eliminated them.</v>

1123
01:07:56.530 --> 01:07:58.120
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole bunch of means to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>

1124
01:07:58.300 --> 01:07:59.830
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an ideology.</v>

1125
01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:01.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone else has a different ideology,</v>

1126
01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:04.690
<v Speaker 2>different version of the significance of</v>
<v Speaker 2>current events,</v>

1127
01:08:04.810 --> 01:08:09.310
<v Speaker 2>a different version of the significance</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the nature of the ideal future and</v>

1128
01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:12.130
<v Speaker 2>they completely different apprehension</v>
<v Speaker 2>of how to transform one or the other.</v>

1129
01:08:12.131 --> 01:08:14.740
<v Speaker 2>When those two cultures come into</v>
<v Speaker 2>contact,</v>

1130
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:15.860
<v Speaker 2>we'll how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1131
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:19.580
<v Speaker 2>they made each other anxious because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not convinced.</v>

1132
01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:22.370
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to answer and goals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if this is the structure that</v>

1133
01:08:22.371 --> 01:08:24.770
<v Speaker 2>regulates emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what's going to happen?</v>

1134
01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:28.580
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you can't just give up your</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn plans because then your emotions</v>

1135
01:08:28.581 --> 01:08:30.350
<v Speaker 2>are dysregulated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fall into chaos,</v>

1136
01:08:30.351 --> 01:08:31.990
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know where you are and you</v>

1137
01:08:31.991 --> 01:08:34.760
<v Speaker 2>don't know who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what to do and you don't</v>

1138
01:08:34.761 --> 01:08:37.250
<v Speaker 2>know where you're going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes you anxious.</v>

1139
01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:38.780
<v Speaker 2>Neither side is going to give up.</v>

1140
01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:41.520
<v Speaker 2>Give up their certainty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1141
01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:44.990
<v Speaker 2>the only thing left and under what</v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances is conflict and you see</v>

1142
01:08:44.991 --> 01:08:46.580
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean look how do,</v>

1143
01:08:46.690 --> 01:08:50.360
<v Speaker 2>how do arguments escalate and argue?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Argument with someone that you love.</v>

1144
01:08:50.361 --> 01:08:52.910
<v Speaker 2>Even if they want one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want another,</v>

1145
01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:56.460
<v Speaker 2>you discuss it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not getting anywhere you're</v>

1146
01:08:56.461 --> 01:09:01.030
<v Speaker 2>tempers raise because the abstract</v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion isn't helping find that you'd</v>

1147
01:09:01.031 --> 01:09:04.550
<v Speaker 2>give up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you move to to violence to solve</v>

1148
01:09:04.551 --> 01:09:06.410
<v Speaker 2>your problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hammer out the story,</v>

1149
01:09:06.411 --> 01:09:07.550
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do that,</v>

1150
01:09:07.551 --> 01:09:11.420
<v Speaker 2>but still oppressing the person who has</v>
<v Speaker 2>the different,</v>

1151
01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:13.230
<v Speaker 2>a different import.</v>

1152
01:09:15.770 --> 01:09:20.770
<v Speaker 2>So your brain is set up to contrast a</v>
<v Speaker 2>vision of what you would like with a</v>

1153
01:09:21.231 --> 01:09:25.520
<v Speaker 2>vision of what's occurring and when</v>
<v Speaker 2>something unexpected occurs and there's</v>

1154
01:09:25.521 --> 01:09:28.730
<v Speaker 2>a whole sequence that emotional</v>
<v Speaker 2>processes that are disinhibited,</v>

1155
01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:31.670
<v Speaker 2>the May deal with the governors governs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then by all appearances.</v>

1156
01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:36.230
<v Speaker 2>It's an extraordinarily ancient Oregon</v>
<v Speaker 2>works in concert with the hippocampus.</v>

1157
01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:39.570
<v Speaker 2>They hit the campus by the way evolved</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the course of five.</v>

1158
01:09:39.571 --> 01:09:42.200
<v Speaker 2>The genesis basically what amphibians</v>
<v Speaker 2>left the ocean.</v>

1159
01:09:42.201 --> 01:09:45.050
<v Speaker 2>So we had this circuitry has been around</v>
<v Speaker 2>a long time,</v>

1160
01:09:45.290 --> 01:09:47.300
<v Speaker 2>a lot longer than your higher cortical</v>
<v Speaker 2>centers.</v>

1161
01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:51.150
<v Speaker 2>It's very sophisticated and it's very</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful and I think you could say that</v>

1162
01:09:51.390 --> 01:09:56.390
<v Speaker 2>we spend our whole lives trying to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure that the Amygdala is shut off so we</v>

1163
01:09:57.021 --> 01:09:58.100
<v Speaker 2>don't like it when it's on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1164
01:09:58.101 --> 01:09:59.450
<v Speaker 2>maybe you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's again,</v>

1165
01:09:59.451 --> 01:10:03.530
<v Speaker 2>that's not exactly true because I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tiny bit of activation under</v>

1166
01:10:03.531 --> 01:10:05.840
<v Speaker 2>controlled circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's optimal,</v>

1167
01:10:06.170 --> 01:10:09.620
<v Speaker 2>but there's a threshold and if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if differs to some degree from</v>

1168
01:10:09.621 --> 01:10:11.930
<v Speaker 2>person to person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you exceed that threshold,</v>

1169
01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:17.560
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing that you dislike more</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause the [inaudible] to the thing that</v>

1170
01:10:17.991 --> 01:10:21.200
<v Speaker 2>says everything that you are is in</v>
<v Speaker 2>danger.</v>

1171
01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:25.860
<v Speaker 2>We'd like to keep it shut off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time it shut off as long as</v>

1172
01:10:25.861 --> 01:10:28.130
<v Speaker 2>we associate with people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>predictable to us,</v>

1173
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:31.670
<v Speaker 2>as long as we know where we're going and</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that we predict our own current,</v>

1174
01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:35.480
<v Speaker 2>it shuts up and the cortical centers are</v>
<v Speaker 2>in control and you know,</v>

1175
01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:37.010
<v Speaker 2>we go down the path that we've chosen.</v>

1176
01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:43.560
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now</v>

1177
01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:52.610
<v Speaker 3>the other thing I'm interested in is</v>

1178
01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:18.010
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say It as far as your brain's concerned.</v>

1179
01:11:19.690 --> 01:11:20.523
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1180
01:11:20.590 --> 01:11:23.020
<v Speaker 2>Let me step one step back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the emotion?</v>

1181
01:11:24.610 --> 01:11:29.610
<v Speaker 2>Emotion is the subjective sensation that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel when you encounter a situation</v>

1182
01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:35.400
<v Speaker 2>that has implications for action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So emotion occupies the space between</v>

1183
01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:41.650
<v Speaker 2>sensory input and motor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you encounter something that has</v>

1184
01:11:41.651 --> 01:11:44.860
<v Speaker 2>significance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel an emotion and an emotion is</v>

1185
01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:48.880
<v Speaker 2>the subjective sense that it companies</v>
<v Speaker 2>the activation or the preoccupation of</v>

1186
01:11:48.881 --> 01:11:51.250
<v Speaker 2>motor output systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's basically how it occurred.</v>

1187
01:11:51.310 --> 01:11:53.140
<v Speaker 2>How it appears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say Well,</v>

1188
01:11:55.770 --> 01:11:56.603
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1189
01:11:57.070 --> 01:12:01.150
<v Speaker 2>you can think of the world the way that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we normally think of it as something</v>

1190
01:12:01.151 --> 01:12:05.860
<v Speaker 2>that exists objectively have something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's amenable to scientific</v>

1191
01:12:05.861 --> 01:12:10.030
<v Speaker 2>description or you can also think of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a place that's full of things that</v>

1192
01:12:10.031 --> 01:12:12.140
<v Speaker 2>have implications for rashes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

1193
01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:19.260
<v Speaker 2>as far as stories are concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the university is a place that's full of</v>

1194
01:12:19.301 --> 01:12:20.950
<v Speaker 2>things that have implications for</v>
<v Speaker 2>action.</v>

1195
01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:24.160
<v Speaker 2>That's the environment from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative perspective.</v>

1196
01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:30.970
<v Speaker 2>The most fundamental substructure of</v>
<v Speaker 2>narratives can be phoning myths and the</v>

1197
01:12:30.971 --> 01:12:35.590
<v Speaker 2>next thing I want to show you is how</v>
<v Speaker 2>miss fundamentally represent the world</v>

1198
01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:38.830
<v Speaker 2>in so far as it's conceived of it as</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that has implication for</v>

1199
01:12:38.831 --> 01:12:41.230
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something with emotional significance.</v>

1200
01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:43.750
<v Speaker 2>So you decided the world of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific object,</v>

1201
01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:46.600
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is devoid of emotional significance</v>

1202
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:50.470
<v Speaker 2>really by design.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of what you do in the scientific</v>

1203
01:12:50.471 --> 01:12:53.620
<v Speaker 2>procedure is eradicate anything that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>purely subjective,</v>

1204
01:12:53.621 --> 01:12:54.454
<v Speaker 2>like emotion.</v>

1205
01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:59.130
<v Speaker 2>If you think a theory is true because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you liked the theory that snoring</v>

1206
01:12:59.150 --> 01:13:02.320
<v Speaker 2>sufficient grounds for considering a</v>
<v Speaker 2>true from the scientific perspective,</v>

1207
01:13:02.321 --> 01:13:04.600
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to make yourself on</v>
<v Speaker 2>objective,</v>

1208
01:13:04.601 --> 01:13:09.040
<v Speaker 2>which basically means to eradicate your</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional assessment of the,</v>

1209
01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:11.170
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a given situation.</v>

1210
01:13:11.410 --> 01:13:14.260
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is we're always assessing</v>
<v Speaker 2>situations for their athletic.</v>

1211
01:13:14.261 --> 01:13:17.380
<v Speaker 2>That significance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to do that because emotion</v>

1212
01:13:17.410 --> 01:13:20.170
<v Speaker 2>around affect needs how to act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you always have to figure out how to</v>

1213
01:13:20.171 --> 01:13:23.500
<v Speaker 2>act in every situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's reasonable to construe the</v>

1214
01:13:23.501 --> 01:13:25.870
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something that has meaning as a</v>

1215
01:13:25.871 --> 01:13:30.871
<v Speaker 2>place where that meaning exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how the world is conceived of</v>

1216
01:13:33.470 --> 01:13:35.110
<v Speaker 2>from the mythological perspective.</v>

1217
01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:38.253
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1218
01:13:42.490 --> 01:13:46.330
<v Speaker 2>It's quite straight forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to talk much about this.</v>

1219
01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:54.520
<v Speaker 2>Mythological representation of chaos is</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the attempt to represent the place</v>

1220
01:13:54.521 --> 01:13:57.280
<v Speaker 2>that everything comes from before</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's any divisions between any,</v>

1221
01:13:58.020 --> 01:14:02.050
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to get into that right now</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the mythological perspective.</v>

1222
01:14:02.770 --> 01:14:04.430
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how the world,</v>

1223
01:14:06.490 --> 01:14:11.490
<v Speaker 2>this is a creation myth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically you're Rachel things into two</v>

1224
01:14:11.921 --> 01:14:15.940
<v Speaker 2>components,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of which is the unknown and the</v>

1225
01:14:15.941 --> 01:14:18.250
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the known.</v>

1226
01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:22.990
<v Speaker 2>Now the no one has this structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a story is if you know something,</v>

1227
01:14:22.991 --> 01:14:25.730
<v Speaker 2>you know the story that goes along with</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means that if you know,</v>

1228
01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.460
<v Speaker 2>if you know a territory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you explore the territory,</v>

1229
01:14:29.461 --> 01:14:31.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean as you know how to act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that's all.</v>

1230
01:14:31.181 --> 01:14:35.620
<v Speaker 2>That's all that I'm trying to emphasize</v>
<v Speaker 2>here and myth.</v>

1231
01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:40.780
<v Speaker 2>From the mythological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world is constructed of three</v>

1232
01:14:40.781 --> 01:14:43.930
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is all those things that you don't</v>

1233
01:14:43.931 --> 01:14:48.280
<v Speaker 2>know as the domain of that unpredictable</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it has a primary motivational</v>

1234
01:14:48.281 --> 01:14:49.114
<v Speaker 2>significance.</v>

1235
01:14:49.210 --> 01:14:50.410
<v Speaker 2>It's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means that Oh,</v>

1236
01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:52.750
<v Speaker 2>first dawn attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it scares the hell out of you and then</v>

1237
01:14:52.751 --> 01:14:54.760
<v Speaker 2>it makes you curious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you stick around long enough.</v>

1238
01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:58.540
<v Speaker 2>First face it reveals is the one that</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes you anxious.</v>

1239
01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:03.040
<v Speaker 2>That's unexplored territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the the dark forest,</v>

1240
01:15:03.050 --> 01:15:04.870
<v Speaker 2>barbarian lands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark water,</v>

1241
01:15:04.871 --> 01:15:09.871
<v Speaker 2>the land of the dead tie math as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] the dragon from Mesopotamian</v>

1242
01:15:10.210 --> 01:15:12.130
<v Speaker 2>creation myth from which everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes.</v>

1243
01:15:12.131 --> 01:15:15.160
<v Speaker 2>Basically</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything frankly,</v>

1244
01:15:15.670 --> 01:15:18.310
<v Speaker 2>anything threatening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that makes you run away,</v>

1245
01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:22.060
<v Speaker 2>anything that's in the dark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that's unfamiliar,</v>

1246
01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:24.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what constitutes the</v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown from the mythological</v>

1247
01:15:24.881 --> 01:15:26.410
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's half the world.</v>

1248
01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:30.040
<v Speaker 2>It's a division between chaos and order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically from the mythological</v>

1249
01:15:30.041 --> 01:15:31.930
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what the universe is composed of.</v>

1250
01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:36.160
<v Speaker 2>Chaos is divided for mortar and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world you live in order.</v>

1251
01:15:36.161 --> 01:15:40.240
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully chaos surrounds you like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the ocean surrounds an island.</v>

1252
01:15:40.241 --> 01:15:42.670
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what this diagram is basically</v>

1253
01:15:42.671 --> 01:15:47.110
<v Speaker 2>trying to represent the known a great</v>
<v Speaker 2>father.</v>

1254
01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:50.110
<v Speaker 2>That's culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the village,</v>

1255
01:15:50.111 --> 01:15:52.450
<v Speaker 2>the nation explored territory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the city,</v>

1256
01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:54.250
<v Speaker 2>the family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the king,</v>

1257
01:15:54.910 --> 01:15:56.860
<v Speaker 2>the predictable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where you live.</v>

1258
01:15:57.100 --> 01:16:00.370
<v Speaker 2>That's where everything is being</v>
<v Speaker 2>transformed from chaos into order where</v>

1259
01:16:00.371 --> 01:16:04.300
<v Speaker 2>everything can be predicted and it sits</v>
<v Speaker 2>on top of the unknown.</v>

1260
01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:21.880
<v Speaker 2>Psychoanalytic interpretations of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rationale for social conflict,</v>

1261
01:16:22.970 --> 01:16:27.970
<v Speaker 2>often positive that what you see in</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who you are willing to persecute</v>

1262
01:16:29.421 --> 01:16:31.010
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your own dark side.</v>

1263
01:16:31.011 --> 01:16:33.590
<v Speaker 2>Those things above you that you're most</v>
<v Speaker 2>unwilling to admit.</v>

1264
01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:37.520
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>truth in that,</v>

1265
01:16:37.521 --> 01:16:41.720
<v Speaker 2>but what's more accurate and more</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental and much less difficult to</v>

1266
01:16:41.721 --> 01:16:46.721
<v Speaker 2>understand in a sense is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone is not familiar to you,</v>

1267
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:54.110
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to presume anything about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mere fact of their existence as</v>

1268
01:16:54.111 --> 01:16:57.830
<v Speaker 2>something unfamiliar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's already sufficient to give them a</v>

1269
01:16:57.831 --> 01:17:01.420
<v Speaker 2>certain emotional valence and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional valence,</v>

1270
01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:06.140
<v Speaker 2>at least on initial contact is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>promotion of anxiety.</v>

1271
01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:10.010
<v Speaker 3>Don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't</v>

1272
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:15.010
<v Speaker 2>have to think in some ways about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessity of projection or your unreal</v>

1273
01:17:15.790 --> 01:17:16.800
<v Speaker 2>are you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1274
01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:20.810
<v Speaker 2>you're only incomprehensibility to</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself or your propensity did until we</v>

1275
01:17:20.811 --> 01:17:25.040
<v Speaker 2>see the evil and others is the mere fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>of unpredictabilities enough to render</v>

1276
01:17:25.041 --> 01:17:29.360
<v Speaker 2>someone associated with this domain that</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes the thing</v>

1277
01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:35.050
<v Speaker 2>I said we classify things in two</v>
<v Speaker 2>different plays in a sense what caused</v>

1278
01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:37.130
<v Speaker 2>to buy things from the scientific</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

1279
01:17:37.131 --> 01:17:40.850
<v Speaker 2>but we also classify them from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective of their significance for</v>

1280
01:17:40.851 --> 01:17:45.851
<v Speaker 2>action and you could say that a natural</v>
<v Speaker 2>category is the class of all things that</v>

1281
01:17:46.491 --> 01:17:50.510
<v Speaker 2>you should run away from and from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective of that sort of</v>

1282
01:17:50.511 --> 01:17:53.930
<v Speaker 2>classification,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that is the sort of thing</v>

1283
01:17:53.931 --> 01:17:56.180
<v Speaker 2>that you should run away from is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>

1284
01:17:56.780 --> 01:17:59.750
<v Speaker 2>So that means anytime you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you encounter something that's</v>

1285
01:17:59.751 --> 01:18:04.280
<v Speaker 2>unpredictable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that thing is instantly thrown into</v>

1286
01:18:04.281 --> 01:18:06.470
<v Speaker 2>the category of all the things that I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever frightened you,</v>

1287
01:18:06.471 --> 01:18:10.520
<v Speaker 2>all the things in your life that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't been able to control because the</v>

1288
01:18:10.521 --> 01:18:14.390
<v Speaker 2>idea of the thing that you should run</v>
<v Speaker 2>away from is one of the most fundamental</v>

1289
01:18:14.391 --> 01:18:15.740
<v Speaker 2>types of classification.</v>

1290
01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:18.830
<v Speaker 2>The ribs just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're always classifying things in terms</v>

1291
01:18:18.831 --> 01:18:20.990
<v Speaker 2>of fundamental significance for</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>

1292
01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:25.070
<v Speaker 2>I found out for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd thought about that,</v>

1293
01:18:25.130 --> 01:18:28.420
<v Speaker 2>I guess about six or seven years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was reading missy Elliot.</v>

1294
01:18:28.650 --> 01:18:30.260
<v Speaker 2>There are many creative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many creation.</v>

1295
01:18:30.261 --> 01:18:33.170
<v Speaker 2>There's the world comes out of the body</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a drag.</v>

1296
01:18:33.230 --> 01:18:35.150
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Mesopotamian creation myth,</v>

1297
01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:39.380
<v Speaker 2>marvel versus timeout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Timeout is a dragon who lives at the</v>

1298
01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:43.070
<v Speaker 2>bottom of the ocean and she's the mother</v>
<v Speaker 2>of all the gods,</v>

1299
01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:45.950
<v Speaker 2>but they make a lot of noise and</v>
<v Speaker 2>irritate your and it also killed her</v>

1300
01:18:45.951 --> 01:18:47.610
<v Speaker 2>husband.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This makes it quite mad,</v>

1301
01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:51.860
<v Speaker 2>so she decided she's going to eat them</v>
<v Speaker 2>all and one of the medicine it can go up</v>

1302
01:18:51.861 --> 01:18:56.120
<v Speaker 2>to the Martech</v>
<v Speaker 2>is elected by.</v>

1303
01:18:56.121 --> 01:18:58.070
<v Speaker 2>The other goal is to go and fight with</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1304
01:18:58.071 --> 01:19:02.160
<v Speaker 2>Map him down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He encloses her in a Gnat and cuts or</v>

1305
01:19:02.161 --> 01:19:02.750
<v Speaker 2>into pieces.</v>

1306
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:06.470
<v Speaker 2>None of the pieces he makes the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He creates</v>

1307
01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:11.600
<v Speaker 2>order from chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the third feature of the</v>

1308
01:19:11.601 --> 01:19:15.770
<v Speaker 2>mythological world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the unknown and there's the no,</v>

1309
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:19.190
<v Speaker 2>and there's process that mediates</v>
<v Speaker 2>between turns.</v>

1310
01:19:19.191 --> 01:19:21.620
<v Speaker 2>One backs the hero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hero.</v>

1311
01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:26.540
<v Speaker 2>He turns up the dragon and makes the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world so he's assimilated to a creator.</v>

1312
01:19:26.541 --> 01:19:27.374
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>

1313
01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:30.440
<v Speaker 2>The reason I'm telling you the story now</v>
<v Speaker 2>of always because I found out from</v>

1314
01:19:30.450 --> 01:19:32.680
<v Speaker 2>Iliad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but many archaic cultures,</v>

1315
01:19:32.690 --> 01:19:35.630
<v Speaker 2>the Iranians and the Egyptians were</v>
<v Speaker 2>three others whose names I don't</v>

1316
01:19:35.631 --> 01:19:39.500
<v Speaker 2>remember a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The symbol that they used for the</v>

1317
01:19:39.501 --> 01:19:42.610
<v Speaker 2>stranger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the barbarian was the same symbol used</v>

1318
01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:46.010
<v Speaker 2>to represent the chaos that predated the</v>
<v Speaker 2>construction of the world.</v>

1319
01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:48.080
<v Speaker 2>So you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is so interesting.</v>

1320
01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:51.890
<v Speaker 2>If you'd grab the Chris Grasp the</v>
<v Speaker 2>significance of that because it meant</v>

1321
01:19:51.891 --> 01:19:53.570
<v Speaker 2>that Egyptian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ancient Egyptians,</v>

1322
01:19:53.571 --> 01:19:55.190
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who never let a foreigner into one of</v>

1323
01:19:55.191 --> 01:19:58.790
<v Speaker 2>their temples because the foreigner</v>
<v Speaker 2>would bring chaos into order.</v>

1324
01:19:59.030 --> 01:20:02.030
<v Speaker 2>The forerunner was chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing for the Egyptian</v>

1325
01:20:02.810 --> 01:20:05.210
<v Speaker 2>foreigner was chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They use the same symbol.</v>

1326
01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:09.150
<v Speaker 2>That's how people think that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We think it's like if you're not from</v>

1327
01:20:09.151 --> 01:20:10.290
<v Speaker 2>the same tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>

1328
01:20:10.291 --> 01:20:12.270
<v Speaker 2>that's defined most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most fundamentally,</v>

1329
01:20:12.271 --> 01:20:15.120
<v Speaker 2>it would be the family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but obviously we've abstracted that up</v>

1330
01:20:15.121 --> 01:20:17.220
<v Speaker 2>into the nation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're into an ideological unit or</v>

1331
01:20:17.221 --> 01:20:18.900
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're not us,</v>

1332
01:20:18.930 --> 01:20:23.790
<v Speaker 2>then you are chaos and all by yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Under those circumstances.</v>

1333
01:20:23.791 --> 01:20:26.400
<v Speaker 2>If you're an agent of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have emotional significance.</v>

1334
01:20:26.730 --> 01:20:29.610
<v Speaker 2>Here's something I know I can't predict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid of things I can't predict.</v>

1335
01:20:29.790 --> 01:20:32.730
<v Speaker 2>You're a threat to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Along the path from that to to</v>

1336
01:20:32.731 --> 01:20:34.470
<v Speaker 2>oppressing you is not very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

1337
01:20:35.230 --> 01:20:36.450
<v Speaker 2>it's a very short one.</v>

1338
01:20:40.250 --> 01:20:41.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things we're going to study</v>

1339
01:20:41.661 --> 01:20:45.720
<v Speaker 2>to a fair degree is mythological</v>
<v Speaker 2>representations of the world hits.</v>

1340
01:20:45.890 --> 01:20:49.880
<v Speaker 2>I find this extremely interesting and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason for this is because as soon</v>

1341
01:20:49.881 --> 01:20:53.450
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you know that we use stories</v>

1342
01:20:53.451 --> 01:20:57.110
<v Speaker 2>to regulate our emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as soon as you know that there are</v>

1343
01:20:57.111 --> 01:20:59.120
<v Speaker 2>two types of information that we need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>gather,</v>

1344
01:20:59.121 --> 01:21:04.121
<v Speaker 2>one be factual information and the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>information about how we should behave,</v>

1345
01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:10.120
<v Speaker 2>then you have the possibility of reading</v>
<v Speaker 2>mythological accounts or stories in</v>

1346
01:21:10.671 --> 01:21:13.820
<v Speaker 2>general from a completely different</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective because you don't have to</v>

1347
01:21:13.821 --> 01:21:15.200
<v Speaker 2>think anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1348
01:21:15.890 --> 01:21:17.660
<v Speaker 2>this mythological account,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1349
01:21:17.661 --> 01:21:21.230
<v Speaker 2>with the creation of the world has no</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship whatsoever to evolutionary</v>

1350
01:21:21.231 --> 01:21:23.510
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know evolutionary theories more</v>

1351
01:21:23.511 --> 01:21:26.130
<v Speaker 2>accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore this whole sequence,</v>

1352
01:21:26.131 --> 01:21:28.970
<v Speaker 2>but accounts has to be cast into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>realm like pseudoscience of</v>

1353
01:21:28.971 --> 01:21:31.340
<v Speaker 2>superstition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then you lose all the information</v>

1354
01:21:31.341 --> 01:21:32.210
<v Speaker 2>that's in those stories.</v>

1355
01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:35.360
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you know that those stories</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't concerned in the least with the</v>

1356
01:21:35.361 --> 01:21:39.950
<v Speaker 2>construction of the objective world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but our concern with the world as it as</v>

1357
01:21:39.951 --> 01:21:43.280
<v Speaker 2>it has significance women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a whole new way of approaching</v>

1358
01:21:43.281 --> 01:21:47.060
<v Speaker 2>the whole new mode of interpreting them</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can start to understand the</v>

1359
01:21:47.061 --> 01:21:51.290
<v Speaker 2>nature of the stories that actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>underlie our culture and believe me,</v>

1360
01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:52.730
<v Speaker 2>that's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's so useful.</v>

1361
01:21:53.210 --> 01:21:54.710
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so useful.</v>

1362
01:21:54.711 --> 01:21:56.570
<v Speaker 2>You can hardly believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>

1363
01:21:56.571 --> 01:22:00.350
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden there's all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>stories that you've heard since the</v>

1364
01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:02.930
<v Speaker 2>earliest days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stories that are basically rationally</v>

1365
01:22:02.931 --> 01:22:05.090
<v Speaker 2>and comprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you twist your</v>

1366
01:22:05.091 --> 01:22:09.020
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions about their origins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just 45 degrees,</v>

1367
01:22:09.021 --> 01:22:11.930
<v Speaker 2>then you can see the order in the mini</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly what it is that they're trying</v>

1368
01:22:11.931 --> 01:22:15.680
<v Speaker 2>to turn to put forth and they all of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sudden made sense.</v>

1369
01:22:16.210 --> 01:22:18.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think knowing,</v>

1370
01:22:18.201 --> 01:22:21.020
<v Speaker 2>just regardless of its implications for</v>
<v Speaker 2>Social Poncelet,</v>

1371
01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:26.270
<v Speaker 2>knowing that getting a key to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning of the stories that's worth</v>

1372
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:30.290
<v Speaker 2>having to plow your way through all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>information that you have to read in</v>

1373
01:22:30.291 --> 01:22:35.291
<v Speaker 2>this course because you all Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll go see if they can see movies and</v>

1374
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:38.290
<v Speaker 2>read novels and look at myths and we'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

1375
01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:39.590
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what that means now,</v>

1376
01:22:39.591 --> 01:22:39.950
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

1377
01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:41.990
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it so interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that's what it means,</v>

1378
01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:45.680
<v Speaker 2>you can immediately see that</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between the story and your</v>

1379
01:22:45.681 --> 01:22:49.580
<v Speaker 2>own and the position that you occupy in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the midst of things.</v>

1380
01:22:49.970 --> 01:22:54.970
<v Speaker 2>It's very fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're interested in representation,</v>

1381
01:22:56.741 --> 01:22:58.540
<v Speaker 2>but right here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to read you a bit of a story</v>

1382
01:22:58.541 --> 01:22:59.374
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1383
01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 2>So the unknown is the great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible mother.</v>

1384
01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:07.360
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1385
01:23:07.361 --> 01:23:09.550
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to accept that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my word for that at the moment.</v>

1386
01:23:09.551 --> 01:23:12.520
<v Speaker 2>But the basic notion is a feminine</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagery.</v>

1387
01:23:12.521 --> 01:23:15.460
<v Speaker 2>10 is tends to be used to represent the</v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown.</v>

1388
01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:19.130
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown is the mother of all things.</v>

1389
01:23:19.131 --> 01:23:22.690
<v Speaker 2>So that's obviously their mystical way</v>
<v Speaker 2>of thinking about it.</v>

1390
01:23:22.691 --> 01:23:27.250
<v Speaker 2>But all I've seen is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every bit of as far as math is</v>

1391
01:23:27.251 --> 01:23:29.890
<v Speaker 2>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>information is the world.</v>

1392
01:23:31.670 --> 01:23:34.990
<v Speaker 2>That's the note.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the information that you generate,</v>

1393
01:23:35.170 --> 01:23:38.440
<v Speaker 2>you generate in contact as a consequence</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your contact with something you</v>

1394
01:23:38.441 --> 01:23:40.690
<v Speaker 2>didn't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is only to say that you generate</v>

1395
01:23:40.691 --> 01:23:42.790
<v Speaker 2>information by exploring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not hurting.</v>

1396
01:23:43.810 --> 01:23:48.460
<v Speaker 2>That's obvious then it's not much of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>step from there to the construing the</v>

1397
01:23:48.461 --> 01:23:52.450
<v Speaker 2>thing that you're investigating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the unknown as the source of</v>

1398
01:23:52.451 --> 01:23:53.284
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

1399
01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:57.820
<v Speaker 2>Perfectly reasonable presupposition and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not such a difficult leap to make,</v>

1400
01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.110
<v Speaker 2>to construe the source of everything as</v>
<v Speaker 2>something feminine thing,</v>

1401
01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:05.050
<v Speaker 2>something that gives birth to things</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways.</v>

1402
01:24:05.490 --> 01:24:09.540
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter if you follow that</v>
<v Speaker 2>train of logic or north or if you accept</v>

1403
01:24:09.541 --> 01:24:12.640
<v Speaker 2>that that isn't the case and that is how</v>
<v Speaker 2>miss tend to represent them.</v>

1404
01:24:12.641 --> 01:24:13.740
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So uh,</v>

1405
01:24:14.110 --> 01:24:16.570
<v Speaker 2>one of the books that you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>read is called the great mother and</v>

1406
01:24:16.571 --> 01:24:18.640
<v Speaker 2>that's how work by your new one and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

1407
01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:23.230
<v Speaker 2>It's 300 pages of description of</v>
<v Speaker 2>mythological representations of the</v>

1408
01:24:23.231 --> 01:24:24.820
<v Speaker 2>feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

1409
01:24:25.390 --> 01:24:28.240
<v Speaker 2>that's the mythological aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to read you a good story about</v>

1410
01:24:28.241 --> 01:24:32.500
<v Speaker 2>rats because I want to show you how</v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply grown with these sorts of notions</v>

1411
01:24:32.501 --> 01:24:35.290
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to tell you a little story first</v>

1412
01:24:35.291 --> 01:24:38.410
<v Speaker 2>before I read this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was watching a bugs bunny cartoon the</v>

1413
01:24:38.410 --> 01:24:39.243
<v Speaker 2>other day with my kids.</v>

1414
01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:42.550
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're probably more or less familiar</v>

1415
01:24:42.551 --> 01:24:46.960
<v Speaker 2>with the bugs bunny cartoon characters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a sheep dog and a wolf and they</v>

1416
01:24:46.961 --> 01:24:51.010
<v Speaker 2>go to work in the morning and sheepdogs</v>
<v Speaker 2>job is to guard the sheep and the wolves</v>

1417
01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:52.660
<v Speaker 2>job is to eat them and they punch the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

1418
01:24:52.661 --> 01:24:55.300
<v Speaker 2>clock in and then they go into their</v>
<v Speaker 2>respective roles.</v>

1419
01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:57.430
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sheep dog is always beating,</v>

1420
01:24:57.890 --> 01:25:00.220
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flop baggy and he gets the real rough</v>

1421
01:25:00.221 --> 01:25:02.350
<v Speaker 2>end of the stick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there's one scene there,</v>

1422
01:25:03.390 --> 01:25:05.740
<v Speaker 2>cause she'd be August,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting on a cliff watching the sheep</v>

1423
01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:07.540
<v Speaker 2>and it's raining and the wolf gets a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bright idea,</v>

1424
01:25:07.541 --> 01:25:10.180
<v Speaker 2>is going to put hair tonic on the sheet</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>

1425
01:25:10.181 --> 01:25:11.290
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1426
01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:13.610
<v Speaker 2>And it's raining so that the sheep dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well not as sweet,</v>

1427
01:25:13.611 --> 01:25:18.611
<v Speaker 2>sneaks up and the sheep Harriton and</v>
<v Speaker 2>hair grows down over his eyes right now.</v>

1428
01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:24.370
<v Speaker 2>So the sheep dog sitting here and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're wolf climbs up the cliff and the</v>

1429
01:25:24.371 --> 01:25:28.270
<v Speaker 2>first thing he does is he has a hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the glove on the stick.</v>

1430
01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:31.920
<v Speaker 2>So he's hiding behind the cliff and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>puts the hand on his dick and he raised</v>

1431
01:25:31.921 --> 01:25:35.020
<v Speaker 2>it in front of the sheep dog space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one response.</v>

1432
01:25:35.290 --> 01:25:40.290
<v Speaker 2>Now that wolf is exploring unexplored</v>
<v Speaker 2>territory and it does.</v>

1433
01:25:40.691 --> 01:25:43.430
<v Speaker 2>It cautiously sticks a stick on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing happens.</v>

1434
01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:46.510
<v Speaker 2>And so then the next thing it has is</v>
<v Speaker 2>just pokes his head up and goes right</v>

1435
01:25:46.511 --> 01:25:48.470
<v Speaker 2>down and it looks nothing terrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>

1436
01:25:48.471 --> 01:25:52.290
<v Speaker 2>And then it climbs up on top of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cliff and it weighs this hand in hand.</v>

1437
01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:53.750
<v Speaker 2>The sheep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are you starting to smile now?</v>

1438
01:25:53.751 --> 01:25:56.030
<v Speaker 2>I thinks it's pretty smart now it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>jumping up and down.</v>

1439
01:25:57.220 --> 01:25:58.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's explored the territory.</v>

1440
01:25:58.831 --> 01:26:03.831
<v Speaker 2>It's mapped it originally the unexplored</v>
<v Speaker 2>territory was anxiety provoking the wolf</v>

1441
01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:06.800
<v Speaker 2>on your way to a whole sequence of</v>
<v Speaker 2>exploratory activities.</v>

1442
01:26:06.890 --> 01:26:08.390
<v Speaker 2>Map The territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's safe.</v>

1443
01:26:08.391 --> 01:26:10.410
<v Speaker 2>So then it's off to steal a sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1444
01:26:10.670 --> 01:26:11.450
<v Speaker 2>that's funny.</v>

1445
01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:15.350
<v Speaker 2>That was funny because animators are</v>
<v Speaker 2>great at picking out what we do and</v>

1446
01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:17.030
<v Speaker 2>exaggerating them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're comical.</v>

1447
01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:19.460
<v Speaker 2>That's exploring unknown territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1448
01:26:20.210 --> 01:26:23.300
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time when behavioral</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologist teach a rat to be afraid</v>

1449
01:26:23.450 --> 01:26:24.650
<v Speaker 2>and that's what they think they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

1450
01:26:24.770 --> 01:26:28.670
<v Speaker 2>they take a route that's secure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they presumed that the natural state</v>

1451
01:26:28.671 --> 01:26:31.150
<v Speaker 2>of the rat is secure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the only bloody reason the rats</v>

1452
01:26:31.151 --> 01:26:33.260
<v Speaker 2>secure is because it's already explored</v>
<v Speaker 2>his cage.</v>

1453
01:26:33.650 --> 01:26:36.980
<v Speaker 2>So you put a rat in a cage and they will</v>
<v Speaker 2>freeze because it's scared.</v>

1454
01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:41.300
<v Speaker 2>And then if nothing terrible happens</v>
<v Speaker 2>soon it unfreezes and then it slowly</v>

1455
01:26:41.301 --> 01:26:43.700
<v Speaker 2>starts to explore it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might just move his eyes first and</v>

1456
01:26:43.701 --> 01:26:46.900
<v Speaker 2>sniff and then if not in terrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens and starts to move and as soon</v>

1457
01:26:46.901 --> 01:26:49.880
<v Speaker 2>and checks out the whole cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if nothing is in there that it's</v>

1458
01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:52.400
<v Speaker 2>going to kill it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has a nap or whatever.</v>

1459
01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:55.820
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it looks for some food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it asked to explore before it's</v>

1460
01:26:55.821 --> 01:26:59.590
<v Speaker 2>secure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now more modern animal psychologist need</v>

1461
01:26:59.630 --> 01:27:01.010
<v Speaker 2>fallen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just sort of starting to study the</v>

1462
01:27:01.011 --> 01:27:03.260
<v Speaker 2>reactions of things like rats in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>natural habitat.</v>

1463
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:05.990
<v Speaker 2>And that's what this story is about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So take a rabbit,</v>

1464
01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:08.900
<v Speaker 2>wraps their social,</v>
<v Speaker 2>set them up in a Burl,</v>

1465
01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:12.260
<v Speaker 2>and they let them set up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were only map out their territory</v>

1466
01:27:12.261 --> 01:27:15.560
<v Speaker 2>by exploring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have this whole burl system set</v>

1467
01:27:15.561 --> 01:27:17.010
<v Speaker 2>up and the rats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1468
01:27:17.011 --> 01:27:18.470
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing's dangerous there,</v>

1469
01:27:18.530 --> 01:27:21.200
<v Speaker 2>that's home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a caffeine,</v>

1470
01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:23.450
<v Speaker 2>one section of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the story.</v>

1471
01:27:23.870 --> 01:27:26.810
<v Speaker 2>When a cat is presented to an</v>
<v Speaker 2>established mixed sex group of</v>

1472
01:27:26.811 --> 01:27:30.440
<v Speaker 2>laboratory rats living in visible girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the behaviors of the subjects changed</v>

1473
01:27:30.441 --> 01:27:33.470
<v Speaker 2>dramatically in many cases for 24 hours</v>
<v Speaker 2>or more.</v>

1474
01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:38.270
<v Speaker 2>The initial act of defensive behavior</v>
<v Speaker 2>flight to the tunnel chamber system.</v>

1475
01:27:38.271 --> 01:27:42.470
<v Speaker 2>So the rats are cruising alone where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think it's safe and there's a cat.</v>

1476
01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:45.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like home into the borough</v>

1477
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:50.450
<v Speaker 2>is followed by a period of immobility</v>
<v Speaker 2>during which the rats make 22 kilohertz,</v>

1478
01:27:50.451 --> 01:27:53.730
<v Speaker 2>ultrasonic vocalization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which apparently served as lawyer cries</v>

1479
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:56.270
<v Speaker 2>that I rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there to put it,</v>

1480
01:27:56.370 --> 01:28:00.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're freaked out and they brought it</v>

1481
01:28:00.261 --> 01:28:04.370
<v Speaker 2>home and screen the frozen and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>screen like they must be screaming</v>

1482
01:28:04.371 --> 01:28:05.570
<v Speaker 2>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

1483
01:28:05.571 --> 01:28:07.820
<v Speaker 2>there's a cat and all the other grads</v>
<v Speaker 2>here this,</v>

1484
01:28:07.821 --> 01:28:09.440
<v Speaker 2>and they're all in their girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're terrifying.</v>

1485
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:14.330
<v Speaker 2>They're frozen into your mobility by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>appearance of this unexpected thing as</v>

1486
01:28:14.331 --> 01:28:16.300
<v Speaker 2>freezing breaks up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>

1487
01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:18.890
<v Speaker 2>Think of a good myth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This persons in the Gorgon</v>

1488
01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:22.640
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the face of the Gorgon was this female</v>

1489
01:28:22.641 --> 01:28:23.720
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This covered the snakes.</v>

1490
01:28:23.721 --> 01:28:27.830
<v Speaker 2>That's a new image of the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That thing turns you to stone anyways,</v>

1491
01:28:28.410 --> 01:28:31.700
<v Speaker 2>as freezing breaks up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Proxemic avoidance of the open area,</v>

1492
01:28:31.701 --> 01:28:34.520
<v Speaker 2>gravity diddly gives way to a pattern of</v>
<v Speaker 2>risk assessment of the area where the</v>

1493
01:28:34.521 --> 01:28:35.354
<v Speaker 2>cat was encountered.</v>

1494
01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:38.030
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the rats are frozen and they think</v>

1495
01:28:38.150 --> 01:28:38.871
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

1496
01:28:38.871 --> 01:28:41.600
<v Speaker 2>death is around the corner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't precisely think that,</v>

1497
01:28:41.601 --> 01:28:44.330
<v Speaker 2>but that's how they act and if nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>

1498
01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:47.000
<v Speaker 2>it's also terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1499
01:28:47.090 --> 01:28:51.670
<v Speaker 2>they start to relax a little bit and as</v>
<v Speaker 2>soon as they start to relax the circuit,</v>

1500
01:28:51.671 --> 01:28:53.090
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very curious about this</v>

1501
01:28:53.091 --> 01:28:55.430
<v Speaker 2>unexpected occurrence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're overwhelmed by anxiety.</v>

1502
01:28:55.431 --> 01:28:58.070
<v Speaker 2>They don't do any exploring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They run back and make sure that nothing</v>

1503
01:28:58.071 --> 01:29:01.010
<v Speaker 2>terrible happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like that movie she could dog may</v>

1504
01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:03.680
<v Speaker 2>run back and how's their anxiety?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Receipts.</v>

1505
01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:05.640
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Curiosity starts to predominate.</v>

1506
01:29:06.420 --> 01:29:09.690
<v Speaker 2>So they go back to the open area subject</v>
<v Speaker 2>to poke their heads out of the tunnel,</v>

1507
01:29:09.691 --> 01:29:13.500
<v Speaker 2>openings to scan the open area where the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cat was presented for minutes or hours</v>

1508
01:29:13.501 --> 01:29:16.410
<v Speaker 2>before emerging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're like watching this is new</v>

1509
01:29:16.411 --> 01:29:18.880
<v Speaker 2>territory now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was not supposed to be a cap</v>

1510
01:29:18.881 --> 01:29:20.400
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's just see what happens.</v>

1511
01:29:20.401 --> 01:29:24.030
<v Speaker 2>So they're watching in Washington</v>
<v Speaker 2>remapping the territory when they do</v>

1512
01:29:24.031 --> 01:29:27.010
<v Speaker 2>emerge there locomotory patents or</v>
<v Speaker 2>characterize while they couldn't have</v>

1513
01:29:27.011 --> 01:29:30.120
<v Speaker 2>run flat so they can't be seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing that's really neat is they</v>

1514
01:29:30.121 --> 01:29:33.330
<v Speaker 2>do short corner runs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is so interesting.</v>

1515
01:29:33.331 --> 01:29:36.630
<v Speaker 2>So you think here's the area the calf</v>
<v Speaker 2>was seen.</v>

1516
01:29:36.631 --> 01:29:37.240
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1517
01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:41.560
<v Speaker 3>so it's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>cat</v>

1518
01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:45.280
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rats on the cat there.</v>

1519
01:29:45.281 --> 01:29:47.800
<v Speaker 2>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is all of a sudden being reading</v>

1520
01:29:47.801 --> 01:29:51.120
<v Speaker 2>novelized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This area was once map and made secure.</v>

1521
01:29:51.121 --> 01:29:53.620
<v Speaker 2>But the appearance of the cap there is</v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing their plans for a loop.</v>

1522
01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:55.990
<v Speaker 2>So one of the routes do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the catch disappeared,</v>

1523
01:29:55.991 --> 01:29:59.650
<v Speaker 2>but they don't trust this area anymore</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was associated with the cat.</v>

1524
01:29:59.860 --> 01:30:04.450
<v Speaker 2>So they do corner rugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bravest of rats leaps out of his</v>

1525
01:30:04.451 --> 01:30:06.440
<v Speaker 2>title.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Bratton was right across a small</v>

1526
01:30:06.441 --> 01:30:09.190
<v Speaker 2>area and if if he doesn't get killed,</v>

1527
01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:13.073
<v Speaker 3>that's safe,</v>

1528
01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:17.930
<v Speaker 2>so then it grows back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes not choke up safe.</v>

1529
01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:22.430
<v Speaker 2>Other rats are in the same place soon if</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no cat.</v>

1530
01:30:22.710 --> 01:30:23.900
<v Speaker 2>Hilarious mapped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1531
01:30:27.070 --> 01:30:30.410
<v Speaker 2>these risk assessment areas appear to</v>
<v Speaker 2>involve active gathering information</v>

1532
01:30:30.411 --> 01:30:33.740
<v Speaker 2>about possible dangerous sources</v>
<v Speaker 2>providing a basis for a gradual return</v>

1533
01:30:33.741 --> 01:30:38.741
<v Speaker 2>to non defensive bt active risk</v>
<v Speaker 2>assessment has not seen during early</v>

1534
01:30:38.811 --> 01:30:42.290
<v Speaker 2>post cat exposure but rises to a peak</v>
<v Speaker 2>about 10 hours later.</v>

1535
01:30:42.530 --> 01:30:46.430
<v Speaker 2>These rats are scared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Non Defensive behaviors such as eating,</v>

1536
01:30:46.431 --> 01:30:49.370
<v Speaker 2>drinking sexually aggressive activity</v>
<v Speaker 2>tend to be reduced over the same period.</v>

1537
01:30:50.410 --> 01:30:52.500
<v Speaker 2>That's because of the anxiety system</v>
<v Speaker 2>just predominance.</v>

1538
01:30:52.670 --> 01:30:54.900
<v Speaker 2>You don't think about anything else when</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a cab around,</v>

1539
01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:58.340
<v Speaker 2>so it's such a great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a great story because you get</v>

1540
01:30:58.341 --> 01:31:02.690
<v Speaker 2>an idea of how their Massey University</v>
<v Speaker 2>is set up like there was known territory</v>

1541
01:31:02.810 --> 01:31:05.870
<v Speaker 2>and then there's on unknown territory</v>
<v Speaker 2>and well known and known territory can</v>

1542
01:31:05.871 --> 01:31:08.960
<v Speaker 2>turn into unknown territory as soon as</v>
<v Speaker 2>something unpredictable happens and when</v>

1543
01:31:08.961 --> 01:31:12.650
<v Speaker 2>something unpredictable happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That hilarious is made novel again and</v>

1544
01:31:12.651 --> 01:31:16.490
<v Speaker 2>the rats have to undergo is very complex</v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern of exploratory activity to make</v>

1545
01:31:16.491 --> 01:31:19.010
<v Speaker 2>their territory secure again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

1546
01:31:19.130 --> 01:31:21.770
<v Speaker 2>that's quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was also the case.</v>

1547
01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:27.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I gave you here a representation of</v>

1548
01:31:27.771 --> 01:31:32.590
<v Speaker 2>novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what normal people,</v>

1549
01:31:32.830 --> 01:31:37.830
<v Speaker 2>it's half threat to me produces anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taft promise and impels exploratory</v>

1550
01:31:38.831 --> 01:31:40.630
<v Speaker 2>activity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anxiety comes up first.</v>

1551
01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:44.080
<v Speaker 2>This has be known among behavioral</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologists for about five decades.</v>

1552
01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:48.610
<v Speaker 2>It's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the exploratory and anxiety circuitry</v>

1553
01:31:48.611 --> 01:31:51.370
<v Speaker 2>are mutually inhibitory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the anxiety circuitry has the upper</v>

1554
01:31:51.371 --> 01:31:55.750
<v Speaker 2>edge in terms of potency and rapidity of</v>
<v Speaker 2>rise and fundamental</v>

1555
01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:59.350
<v Speaker 3>so long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1556
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:04.250
<v Speaker 2>so let me show you something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1557
01:32:04.450 --> 01:32:08.620
<v Speaker 2>it's also the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So racks,</v>

1558
01:32:08.621 --> 01:32:12.490
<v Speaker 2>they identify each other by smell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you smell like you should smell,</v>

1559
01:32:12.491 --> 01:32:14.790
<v Speaker 2>then you're familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not contaminated with the</v>

1560
01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:16.900
<v Speaker 2>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your behavior is predictable,</v>

1561
01:32:16.901 --> 01:32:20.110
<v Speaker 2>which basically means that I know your</v>
<v Speaker 2>place in the dominance hierarchy.</v>

1562
01:32:20.350 --> 01:32:23.350
<v Speaker 2>I know what role you play with all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other animals,</v>

1563
01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:26.290
<v Speaker 2>and I know how to behave in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>presence.</v>

1564
01:32:26.410 --> 01:32:27.720
<v Speaker 2>You're familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're Ken.</v>

1565
01:32:27.730 --> 01:32:30.220
<v Speaker 2>And I can tell that if I'm a rat bite of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that you spell,</v>

1566
01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:33.190
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you take a rat that everyone loves</v>

1567
01:32:33.310 --> 01:32:37.390
<v Speaker 2>and you pull it out of its cage and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>wash it off and you throw it back in</v>

1568
01:32:37.391 --> 01:32:42.391
<v Speaker 2>with the rats would kill it because that</v>
<v Speaker 2>rat is now contaminated with the unknown</v>

1569
01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:47.770
<v Speaker 2>and we don't like to have the unknown</v>
<v Speaker 2>around because it upsets our</v>

1570
01:32:47.771 --> 01:32:50.260
<v Speaker 2>predictability and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Predictability gets upset that our</v>

1571
01:32:50.261 --> 01:32:54.790
<v Speaker 2>anxiety levels rise and all hell breaks</v>
<v Speaker 2>loose and literally all hell breaks</v>

1572
01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:57.310
<v Speaker 2>loose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's actually pam is a mythological</v>

1573
01:32:57.311 --> 01:33:01.600
<v Speaker 2>representations of the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These fats in part,</v>

1574
01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:04.903
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1575
01:33:06.250 --> 01:33:09.610
<v Speaker 2>from the mythological perspective of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world has three constituent elements,</v>

1576
01:33:09.790 --> 01:33:12.280
<v Speaker 2>the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is everywhere,</v>

1577
01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:15.760
<v Speaker 2>the known and the process by which one</v>
<v Speaker 2>has turned into the other,</v>

1578
01:33:15.761 --> 01:33:20.761
<v Speaker 2>which is basically exploration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the knower is the archetypical</v>

1579
01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:26.230
<v Speaker 2>archetipal pattern of expiration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing that mediates between the</v>

1580
01:33:26.231 --> 01:33:29.050
<v Speaker 2>unknown and the known and from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mythological perspective part of the</v>

1581
01:33:29.051 --> 01:33:32.380
<v Speaker 2>process creates the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See that's the,</v>

1582
01:33:32.381 --> 01:33:35.620
<v Speaker 2>that's absolutely fascinating too if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about it from him because he can</v>

1583
01:33:35.621 --> 01:33:37.800
<v Speaker 2>think about something like the fact of</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1584
01:33:37.801 --> 01:33:41.620
<v Speaker 2>a our democratic system now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our democratic system is deeply rooted</v>

1585
01:33:41.621 --> 01:33:44.050
<v Speaker 2>in religious presuppositions bidding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we forget now,</v>

1586
01:33:44.051 --> 01:33:46.540
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're still there.</v>

1587
01:33:46.630 --> 01:33:48.010
<v Speaker 2>They're implicit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're there.</v>

1588
01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:50.080
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the implicit presumptions is that</v>

1589
01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:54.190
<v Speaker 2>every individual in our society is</v>
<v Speaker 2>worthy of respect.</v>

1590
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:57.190
<v Speaker 2>That's the core aspect of your natural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1591
01:33:57.191 --> 01:33:58.930
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you're a criminal,</v>

1592
01:33:58.931 --> 01:34:02.710
<v Speaker 2>like even if you've broken rules that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you admit you broken in this society and</v>

1593
01:34:02.711 --> 01:34:04.450
<v Speaker 2>others that have the same preset</v>
<v Speaker 2>positions,</v>

1594
01:34:04.750 --> 01:34:06.280
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still have a whole sequence of</v>

1595
01:34:06.281 --> 01:34:11.281
<v Speaker 2>rights that cannot be violated because</v>
<v Speaker 2>in principle there's something about you</v>

1596
01:34:12.370 --> 01:34:15.790
<v Speaker 2>that's worthy of respect regardless of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your behavior.</v>

1597
01:34:16.650 --> 01:34:19.330
<v Speaker 2>The question is what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>

1598
01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:22.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think even see this in simpler social</v>

1599
01:34:22.031 --> 01:34:23.050
<v Speaker 2>animals like wolves.</v>

1600
01:34:23.470 --> 01:34:24.303
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1601
01:34:25.210 --> 01:34:26.260
<v Speaker 2>Oops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1602
01:34:26.261 --> 01:34:27.640
<v Speaker 2>they live in social groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have dominance.</v>

1603
01:34:27.641 --> 01:34:30.310
<v Speaker 2>Hierarchies and wolves are always trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to climb up the dominance hierarchy,</v>

1604
01:34:30.311 --> 01:34:32.470
<v Speaker 2>which is good for the wolf pack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause the strongest animal,</v>

1605
01:34:32.580 --> 01:34:34.150
<v Speaker 2>more or less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most competent animal.</v>

1606
01:34:34.151 --> 01:34:36.100
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't be at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyways,</v>

1607
01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:40.900
<v Speaker 2>if one will fight with another wolf and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they very seldom injure each other if</v>

1608
01:34:40.901 --> 01:34:43.450
<v Speaker 2>they're in the same group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is good because you don't want the</v>

1609
01:34:43.451 --> 01:34:47.140
<v Speaker 2>group diminished by constant intergroup</v>
<v Speaker 2>intergroup conflict.</v>

1610
01:34:48.070 --> 01:34:49.780
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the talk wolf,</v>

1611
01:34:50.150 --> 01:34:53.090
<v Speaker 2>the wolf who wins the conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is usually more of threat</v>

1612
01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:55.060
<v Speaker 2>posturing than actual physical</v>
<v Speaker 2>engagement,</v>

1613
01:34:55.061 --> 01:34:59.000
<v Speaker 2>although sometimes a real fight breaks</v>
<v Speaker 2>out if wolf that loses the dominance</v>

1614
01:34:59.001 --> 01:35:02.930
<v Speaker 2>dispute benefits submissive behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which basically means it rolls over and</v>

1615
01:35:02.931 --> 01:35:05.690
<v Speaker 2>shows its throat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means you can kill me now if you</v>

1616
01:35:05.691 --> 01:35:07.760
<v Speaker 2>want to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll stops and you can say,</v>

1617
01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:12.440
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stronger wolf packs as if it's</v>

1618
01:35:12.441 --> 01:35:17.270
<v Speaker 2>constrained by knowledge that even the</v>
<v Speaker 2>weaker members of the group still can</v>

1619
01:35:17.271 --> 01:35:19.760
<v Speaker 2>conceivably contribute something of</v>
<v Speaker 2>value to the group.</v>

1620
01:35:20.090 --> 01:35:21.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we're like to in our</v>

1621
01:35:21.470 --> 01:35:25.280
<v Speaker 2>organizations except we've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got that principal up almost to</v>

1622
01:35:25.281 --> 01:35:30.170
<v Speaker 2>the point where we understand that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the individual who in contact with the</v>

1623
01:35:30.171 --> 01:35:34.670
<v Speaker 2>unknown generates inflammation and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation constitutes the group and</v>

1624
01:35:34.671 --> 01:35:38.380
<v Speaker 2>the individual is valuable because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>are in fact assimilated to the</v>

1625
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:41.240
<v Speaker 2>mythological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the force that creates the world,</v>

1626
01:35:41.241 --> 01:35:45.550
<v Speaker 2>which is basically the forest that</v>
<v Speaker 2>renders the unknown,</v>

1627
01:35:45.551 --> 01:35:49.550
<v Speaker 2>predictable or that creates order out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos and say the aspect of people</v>

1628
01:35:49.551 --> 01:35:53.540
<v Speaker 2>that's divine theoretically is the part</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stands on the border between the</v>

1629
01:35:53.541 --> 01:35:57.590
<v Speaker 2>unknown and the known and the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>information from unexplored territory in</v>

1630
01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:01.280
<v Speaker 2>two explored territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Expanding the dog to the dominion of the</v>

1631
01:36:01.281 --> 01:36:02.300
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's</v>

1632
01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:05.780
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's this?</v>

1633
01:36:07.030 --> 01:36:09.710
<v Speaker 2>I says Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the devour.</v>

1634
01:36:10.190 --> 01:36:12.850
<v Speaker 2>She's a negative mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

1635
01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:15.160
<v Speaker 2>from a mythological perspective and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>find very,</v>

1636
01:36:15.161 --> 01:36:15.950
<v Speaker 2>very interesting.</v>

1637
01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:18.470
<v Speaker 2>She's the best representation of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of thing that I've ever seen.</v>

1638
01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:22.520
<v Speaker 2>If the myth that you think maths,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they last a long time,</v>

1639
01:36:22.521 --> 01:36:25.000
<v Speaker 2>sometimes tens of thousands of years and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1640
01:36:25.010 --> 01:36:28.740
<v Speaker 2>they often even last across cultures and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

1641
01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:29.630
<v Speaker 2>who are they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is it?</v>

1642
01:36:29.631 --> 01:36:34.631
<v Speaker 2>What could the story actually be telling</v>
<v Speaker 2>you that could be useful given that much</v>

1643
01:36:35.631 --> 01:36:38.010
<v Speaker 2>change?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1644
01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:42.980
<v Speaker 2>the mythological world that stories are</v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned with is composed of three</v>

1645
01:36:42.981 --> 01:36:44.150
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The unknown,</v>

1646
01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:46.900
<v Speaker 2>but it's always there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter when you live or where</v>

1647
01:36:46.901 --> 01:36:48.980
<v Speaker 2>you live or who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of your experience.</v>

1648
01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:50.540
<v Speaker 2>It's always going to be part of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

1649
01:36:50.541 --> 01:36:53.160
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter how much you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always things that you can</v>

1650
01:36:53.161 --> 01:36:55.610
<v Speaker 2>predict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more you know what the more</v>

1651
01:36:55.611 --> 01:36:58.580
<v Speaker 2>potential problems there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because knowledge in itself even breeds</v>

1652
01:36:58.581 --> 01:37:00.140
<v Speaker 2>new problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's always there.</v>

1653
01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:02.270
<v Speaker 2>The fact of culture is always there.</v>

1654
01:37:03.420 --> 01:37:07.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean the cultures may change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that there's culture and</v>

1655
01:37:07.041 --> 01:37:09.830
<v Speaker 2>that you're a product of culture and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have to add to it or at least</v>

1656
01:37:09.980 --> 01:37:13.970
<v Speaker 2>establish some relationship to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it protects you and creates you and</v>

1657
01:37:13.971 --> 01:37:16.070
<v Speaker 2>that you contribute to it and that never</v>
<v Speaker 2>changes.</v>

1658
01:37:16.340 --> 01:37:19.130
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that you're the</v>
<v Speaker 2>intermediary between those two forces,</v>

1659
01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:22.430
<v Speaker 2>that never changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what describes those three</v>

1660
01:37:22.431 --> 01:37:26.210
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a representation of the unknown.</v>

1661
01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:30.950
<v Speaker 2>The unknown is also as well as being the</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that gives rise to everything.</v>

1662
01:37:30.951 --> 01:37:35.450
<v Speaker 2>It's also the thing that destroys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything gets on the things that we</v>

1663
01:37:35.451 --> 01:37:39.560
<v Speaker 2>cannot control it in the final analysis</v>
<v Speaker 2>lead to our demise.</v>

1664
01:37:39.710 --> 01:37:42.020
<v Speaker 2>It's our ignorance that causes our death</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a sense.</v>

1665
01:37:42.021 --> 01:37:45.620
<v Speaker 2>We just can't stop something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can't stop aging disease.</v>

1666
01:37:46.010 --> 01:37:48.680
<v Speaker 2>We can't stop starvation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's are all things that we haven't</v>

1667
01:37:48.681 --> 01:37:50.990
<v Speaker 2>got a grip on there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All things that are still unknown,</v>

1668
01:37:51.020 --> 01:37:52.970
<v Speaker 2>unpredictable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sooner or later they get us.</v>

1669
01:37:55.110 --> 01:37:57.750
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at Kelly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1670
01:37:57.751 --> 01:38:00.090
<v Speaker 2>the first thing I'd like to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1671
01:38:00.091 --> 01:38:03.270
<v Speaker 2>the unknown automatically frightened to</v>
<v Speaker 2>us or other things that automatically</v>

1672
01:38:03.271 --> 01:38:05.670
<v Speaker 2>frightened us more or less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some dispute about this and the</v>

1673
01:38:05.671 --> 01:38:08.010
<v Speaker 2>behavioral insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are things that you can learn to</v>

1674
01:38:08.011 --> 01:38:10.770
<v Speaker 2>become afraid of very easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spiders,</v>

1675
01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:14.160
<v Speaker 2>snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fire alarm skeletons,</v>

1676
01:38:14.161 --> 01:38:18.590
<v Speaker 2>disembodied bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are all elements of horror movies.</v>

1677
01:38:18.591 --> 01:38:20.490
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty obvious that people are more</v>
<v Speaker 2>and less afraid of them.</v>

1678
01:38:20.491 --> 01:38:22.110
<v Speaker 2>It's not that difficult to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 2>why.</v>

1679
01:38:22.260 --> 01:38:25.530
<v Speaker 2>The only debate in them in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the psychological literature is</v>

1680
01:38:25.531 --> 01:38:29.760
<v Speaker 2>whether those fears are actually nate or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you have to acquire them through</v>

1681
01:38:29.761 --> 01:38:32.490
<v Speaker 2>very brief exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter as far as I'm</v>

1682
01:38:32.491 --> 01:38:34.710
<v Speaker 2>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point is is that those things might</v>

1683
01:38:34.711 --> 01:38:39.090
<v Speaker 2>be regarded as</v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily appropriate.</v>

1684
01:38:39.091 --> 01:38:42.780
<v Speaker 2>Representatives of the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's myth trying to do?</v>

1685
01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:48.090
<v Speaker 2>It's trying to encapsulate behavioral</v>
<v Speaker 2>wisdom under what circumstances and what</v>

1686
01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:48.930
<v Speaker 2>world?</v>

1687
01:38:48.930 --> 01:38:50.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the answer to that is in the world</v>

1688
01:38:50.401 --> 01:38:55.050
<v Speaker 2>that's composed of the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the known and the mediating force say if</v>

1689
01:38:55.051 --> 01:38:57.750
<v Speaker 2>you have to adapt to the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you have to do.</v>

1690
01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:01.620
<v Speaker 2>The thing to do logically say you'd have</v>
<v Speaker 2>an infinite amount of time at your</v>

1691
01:39:01.621 --> 01:39:05.880
<v Speaker 2>disposal is to come up with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>representation of what the unknown is a</v>

1692
01:39:05.881 --> 01:39:07.860
<v Speaker 2>strange thing to do because you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know what it is.</v>

1693
01:39:07.861 --> 01:39:09.930
<v Speaker 2>So the question is how the hell can you</v>
<v Speaker 2>represent it?</v>

1694
01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:12.870
<v Speaker 2>But the one thing you do know about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always the case is that it makes</v>

1695
01:39:12.871 --> 01:39:16.920
<v Speaker 2>you afraid and it makes you curious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you want to make a representation</v>

1696
01:39:16.921 --> 01:39:19.830
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you use those things that you do</v>

1697
01:39:19.831 --> 01:39:21.600
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something about that either make you</v>

1698
01:39:21.601 --> 01:39:25.470
<v Speaker 2>afraid or curious and let's look at this</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure figure to who,</v>

1699
01:39:25.530 --> 01:39:27.930
<v Speaker 2>whom at some point in history and not so</v>
<v Speaker 2>long ago,</v>

1700
01:39:27.931 --> 01:39:30.040
<v Speaker 2>human sacrifices pro actually offered</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1701
01:39:30.380 --> 01:39:31.830
<v Speaker 2>We're on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to look a little bit at the</v>

1702
01:39:31.831 --> 01:39:33.570
<v Speaker 2>reasons for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is Kelly.</v>

1703
01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:37.080
<v Speaker 2>She is the thing that everything goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to she's a representative of the</v>

1704
01:39:37.081 --> 01:39:38.060
<v Speaker 2>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1705
01:39:38.061 --> 01:39:41.490
<v Speaker 2>let's look at her now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's something that produces religious</v>

1706
01:39:41.970 --> 01:39:45.030
<v Speaker 2>devotion in those who apprehend her</v>
<v Speaker 2>presence.</v>

1707
01:39:46.230 --> 01:39:49.280
<v Speaker 2>Seizure of meaning fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you could assimilate to and</v>

1708
01:39:49.290 --> 01:39:53.790
<v Speaker 2>religious experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She has eight legs like a spider.</v>

1709
01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:57.630
<v Speaker 2>She spins the web of faith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the reason the web has made a</v>

1710
01:39:57.631 --> 01:40:00.320
<v Speaker 2>fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her hair's on fire too by the way.</v>

1711
01:40:02.010 --> 01:40:07.010
<v Speaker 2>She sits in the middle of that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She has a head dress of skulls and</v>

1712
01:40:07.441 --> 01:40:12.441
<v Speaker 2>usually has a snake around her waist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A snake's a symbol of transformation</v>

1713
01:40:12.721 --> 01:40:15.390
<v Speaker 2>because it sheds its skin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so theoretically did something that's</v>

1714
01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:17.370
<v Speaker 2>reborn anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1715
01:40:18.090 --> 01:40:23.090
<v Speaker 2>she often has staring eyes protruding</v>
<v Speaker 2>teeth to something else that people are</v>

1716
01:40:23.491 --> 01:40:28.491
<v Speaker 2>pretty much in a predisposed to respond</v>
<v Speaker 2>to and she is so in her hands are tools</v>

1717
01:40:29.851 --> 01:40:34.710
<v Speaker 2>of creation and destruction and she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously giving birth to this</v>

1718
01:40:34.740 --> 01:40:39.270
<v Speaker 2>gentleman and eating here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That</v>

1719
01:40:41.010 --> 01:40:44.760
<v Speaker 2>symbol that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would say,</v>

1720
01:40:44.820 --> 01:40:46.160
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1721
01:40:46.830 --> 01:40:49.860
<v Speaker 2>now you understand two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You understand that you have an innate</v>

1722
01:40:49.861 --> 01:40:51.690
<v Speaker 2>response for the unknown and the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>APP,</v>

1723
01:40:51.930 --> 01:40:55.000
<v Speaker 2>permanent constituent elements of</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience from the perspective of</v>

1724
01:40:55.001 --> 01:40:55.834
<v Speaker 2>emotion.</v>

1725
01:40:58.810 --> 01:41:02.170
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at figure like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can get some comprehension of</v>

1726
01:41:03.250 --> 01:41:07.810
<v Speaker 2>what it is that people are trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>avoid contacting the attempt to maintain</v>

1727
01:41:07.811 --> 01:41:08.790
<v Speaker 2>things predictable.</v>

1728
01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:24.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to close this,</v>

1729
01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:26.640
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1730
01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:31.640
<v Speaker 2>this is a hint about the second part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the course.</v>

1731
01:41:31.641 --> 01:41:33.890
<v Speaker 2>So the first part of the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while it's going to,</v>

1732
01:41:34.130 --> 01:41:36.830
<v Speaker 2>there's one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot more detail to the story</v>

1733
01:41:36.831 --> 01:41:40.580
<v Speaker 2>than I brand across today and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>some complicating factors that make the</v>

1734
01:41:40.581 --> 01:41:43.090
<v Speaker 2>whole story much more interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1735
01:41:43.170 --> 01:41:45.620
<v Speaker 2>this is interesting already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is the most,</v>

1736
01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.980
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has something to do with hope.</v>

1737
01:41:49.170 --> 01:41:52.400
<v Speaker 2>When let's say you're a natively</v>
<v Speaker 2>predisposed to respond to the</v>

1738
01:41:52.401 --> 01:41:55.190
<v Speaker 2>unpredictable with anxiety and perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 2>to eliminate it.</v>

1739
01:41:55.191 --> 01:41:57.320
<v Speaker 2>If you care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can understand why that is,</v>

1740
01:41:57.321 --> 01:41:59.660
<v Speaker 2>but you need to be able to predict your</v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances.</v>

1741
01:41:59.930 --> 01:42:02.930
<v Speaker 2>You have to be able,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of just give up your story or</v>

1742
01:42:02.931 --> 01:42:06.260
<v Speaker 2>your culture because that throws you</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely emptied chaos and that's</v>

1743
01:42:06.350 --> 01:42:08.720
<v Speaker 2>unpleasant because unpleasant does</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything you could imagine</v>

1744
01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:13.930
<v Speaker 2>what other people believe different</v>
<v Speaker 2>things and obviously when you come into</v>

1745
01:42:13.931 --> 01:42:16.840
<v Speaker 2>contact with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while there's a high likelihood of</v>

1746
01:42:16.841 --> 01:42:19.810
<v Speaker 2>depression and aggression of such</v>
<v Speaker 2>magnitude that there's a good</v>

1747
01:42:19.811 --> 01:42:22.930
<v Speaker 2>probability that you'll be destroyed and</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the person that you're</v>

1748
01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:25.550
<v Speaker 2>aggressing against that just really</v>
<v Speaker 2>striking as you know,</v>

1749
01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:29.080
<v Speaker 2>all that greatest solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the one hand you give up your ideas</v>

1750
01:42:29.081 --> 01:42:30.770
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you are subject to half active</v>

1751
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:33.190
<v Speaker 2>dysregulation of the most intolerable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

1752
01:42:33.430 --> 01:42:36.430
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you pursue your particular ideas in</v>

1753
01:42:36.431 --> 01:42:39.490
<v Speaker 2>the face of opposition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you might run into a circumstance</v>

1754
01:42:39.491 --> 01:42:41.970
<v Speaker 2>where aggression is inevitable and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be the end of the year.</v>

1755
01:42:42.850 --> 01:42:45.690
<v Speaker 2>This is a bad sort of paradox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1756
01:42:46.930 --> 01:42:49.360
<v Speaker 2>so what can be done about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that has,</v>

1757
01:42:49.690 --> 01:42:52.630
<v Speaker 2>I guess you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to give you the answer in the tiniest</v>

1758
01:42:52.650 --> 01:42:56.030
<v Speaker 2>sort of the shelves and has something to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do with your attitude towards anomalous</v>

1759
01:42:56.170 --> 01:42:59.890
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the highest likelihood of not</v>

1760
01:42:59.891 --> 01:43:04.060
<v Speaker 2>falling into this sort of trap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If when something unexpected happens to</v>

1761
01:43:04.780 --> 01:43:08.590
<v Speaker 2>you register and you explore it to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>why it was that you were wrong,</v>

1762
01:43:08.650 --> 01:43:11.950
<v Speaker 2>to accept the fact of the anomalous</v>
<v Speaker 2>information and to explore it.</v>

1763
01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:17.710
<v Speaker 2>This is a nice figure and I'll close</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a discussion with just a brief</v>

1764
01:43:17.711 --> 01:43:19.290
<v Speaker 2>discussion of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a bonus.</v>

1765
01:43:19.291 --> 01:43:22.120
<v Speaker 2>Sound Fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an eastern image.</v>

1766
01:43:22.750 --> 01:43:26.350
<v Speaker 2>Then I suppose you could assimilate to</v>
<v Speaker 2>some degree to Christ in the West.</v>

1767
01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:32.400
<v Speaker 2>It's an image of the hero and the hero</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the intermediary between the known</v>

1768
01:43:33.281 --> 01:43:34.730
<v Speaker 2>and the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tierra.</v>

1769
01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:37.050
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first one goes out where it's</v>

1770
01:43:37.090 --> 01:43:39.490
<v Speaker 2>frightening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See this little dragon stories should</v>

1771
01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:43.090
<v Speaker 2>have mentioned that dragon dragons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they live in the bottom of the mountain</v>

1772
01:43:43.091 --> 01:43:46.100
<v Speaker 2>and they sit on a treasure and if he</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to treasure you,</v>

1773
01:43:46.150 --> 01:43:48.760
<v Speaker 2>go out of your community is threatened</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the Dragon.</v>

1774
01:43:49.030 --> 01:43:51.860
<v Speaker 2>If you weren't the church you go to and</v>
<v Speaker 2>slayer overcome with drag.</v>

1775
01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:54.080
<v Speaker 2>Bringing back the treasure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you come back,</v>

1776
01:43:54.081 --> 01:43:57.370
<v Speaker 2>then your communities transform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last of the story about explorations</v>

1777
01:43:57.410 --> 01:44:00.320
<v Speaker 2>is the dragon isn't the thing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously threatened in the</v>

1778
01:44:00.321 --> 01:44:03.530
<v Speaker 2>promising as well as archaic and ancient</v>
<v Speaker 2>and our full,</v>

1779
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:07.520
<v Speaker 2>the hero is the person leaves in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>community to encounter that</v>

1780
01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:15.220
<v Speaker 2>arc in temple phenomena to overcome it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get the tragedy to bring it back to</v>

1781
01:44:15.651 --> 01:44:17.720
<v Speaker 2>the community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is therefore you rich.</v>

1782
01:44:17.930 --> 01:44:20.030
<v Speaker 2>That's the path of the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

1783
01:44:20.820 --> 01:44:25.820
<v Speaker 2>this is a very interesting image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That finger see the attempt by the</v>

1784
01:44:25.851 --> 01:44:28.760
<v Speaker 2>author to make it recurring ready and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1785
01:44:28.761 --> 01:44:32.360
<v Speaker 2>this is the sky by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this might be conceived of as a</v>

1786
01:44:32.361 --> 01:44:36.640
<v Speaker 2>tunnel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a tunnel into time and into</v>

1787
01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:38.510
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the most,</v>

1788
01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:41.780
<v Speaker 2>this is the present and this is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>past.</v>

1789
01:44:41.820 --> 01:44:45.110
<v Speaker 2>Does it extends back as far as can</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly be imagined.</v>

1790
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:49.760
<v Speaker 2>This finger sits on me or I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's kind of blurry and that's</v>

1791
01:44:49.761 --> 01:44:52.430
<v Speaker 2>unfortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let me see here.</v>

1792
01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:57.080
<v Speaker 2>See these fingers at the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are figures that are very much</v>

1793
01:44:57.081 --> 01:45:00.590
<v Speaker 2>like Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same sort of thing.</v>

1794
01:45:01.550 --> 01:45:06.550
<v Speaker 2>This representation is this figure of</v>
<v Speaker 2>triumphing in a sense over this speaker,</v>

1795
01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:11.750
<v Speaker 2>this</v>
<v Speaker 2>swelling by fire as well,</v>

1796
01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:16.840
<v Speaker 2>and it's a symbol of transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is an attempt to portray the fact</v>

1797
01:45:17.630 --> 01:45:22.630
<v Speaker 2>that the pattern of behavior that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristic of the hero is something</v>

1798
01:45:23.001 --> 01:45:25.640
<v Speaker 2>that constantly recurs through time.</v>

1799
01:45:25.730 --> 01:45:27.710
<v Speaker 2>That's an architect from the union</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

1800
01:45:28.300 --> 01:45:32.330
<v Speaker 2>just the fact of exploration and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>tendency for us,</v>

1801
01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:36.080
<v Speaker 2>that's an ending bill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the human psyche biologically</v>

1802
01:45:36.081 --> 01:45:38.660
<v Speaker 2>predicate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's part of the,</v>

1803
01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:40.700
<v Speaker 2>it's part of the apparatus that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>inherit,</v>

1804
01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:41.593
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>

1805
01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:43.940
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing to do with inherited</v>
<v Speaker 2>memories or anything,</v>

1806
01:45:44.210 --> 01:45:44.780
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1807
01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:47.210
<v Speaker 2>I'll just try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just has to do with the fact that</v>

1808
01:45:47.211 --> 01:45:50.060
<v Speaker 2>that's the sort of creature you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're always,</v>

1809
01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:53.690
<v Speaker 2>you always serve as the intermediary</v>
<v Speaker 2>between unexplored territory,</v>

1810
01:45:53.691 --> 01:45:55.040
<v Speaker 2>unexplored territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

1811
01:45:55.041 --> 01:45:57.110
<v Speaker 2>No matter where you live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a finger then,</v>

1812
