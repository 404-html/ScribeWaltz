WEBVTT

1
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.190
<v Speaker 1>We've had written history for 5,000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

2
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.560
<v Speaker 1>People have been generally literate for </v>
<v Speaker 1>less than 500 years,</v>

3
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.740
<v Speaker 1>but we've had culture for 150,000 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>identifiable culture for at least 25,000</v>

4
00:00:51.071 --> 00:00:56.071
<v Speaker 1>so the vast period of our enculturation </v>
<v Speaker 1>was preliterate in culturation before we</v>

5
00:00:56.411 --> 00:00:59.380
<v Speaker 1>could write down the rules and transmit </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

6
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.410
<v Speaker 1>How were they transmitted?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assuming we had culture?</v>

7
00:01:02.411 --> 00:01:05.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a variety of mechanisms.</v>

8
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.633
<v Speaker 1>We have a tendency to see elements of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world in personified form because </v>

9
00:01:10.631 --> 00:01:11.464
<v Speaker 1>most of the interrelationships we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the world are actually social or </v>

10
00:01:14.711 --> 00:01:15.544
<v Speaker 1>interpersonal relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's basically how our brain is </v>

11
00:01:17.201 --> 00:01:18.760
<v Speaker 1>structured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as we evolved,</v>

12
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.983
<v Speaker 1>we develop the capacity to extend our </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive ability beyond the merely </v>

13
00:01:22.511 --> 00:01:23.344
<v Speaker 1>social to take in the world as such.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the categories that we use to do </v>

14
00:01:27.251 --> 00:01:29.020
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're still fundamentally social.</v>

15
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.123
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason the unknown per se is </v>

16
00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:36.340
<v Speaker 1>symbolized his feminine is because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>critical feature of the feminine,</v>

17
00:01:36.341 --> 00:01:40.300
<v Speaker 1>and I don't mean the female individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the feminine as a category is its</v>

18
00:01:40.301 --> 00:01:42.490
<v Speaker 1>capacity to generate new forms.</v>

19
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.593
<v Speaker 1>And the unknown is such as as logically </v>
<v Speaker 1>and appropriately symbolized by the </v>

20
00:01:48.521 --> 00:01:52.420
<v Speaker 1>feminine because it's the bringer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fourth of all things,</v>

21
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.270
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that the background of </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence,</v>

22
00:01:55.271 --> 00:01:56.104
<v Speaker 1>the unknowable background of existence </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the thing that generates everything </v>

23
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.880
<v Speaker 1>paired with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

24
00:02:00.881 --> 00:02:02.830
<v Speaker 1>according to the Schema that we've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>working with,</v>

25
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the archetype of the great father.</v>

26
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.880
<v Speaker 1>And the archetype of the great father is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the archetype of tradition.</v>

27
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally the great weight of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

28
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.500
<v Speaker 1>Because as you incorporate your past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the past of your culture,</v>

29
00:02:17.501 --> 00:02:19.540
<v Speaker 1>through the intermediation of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents,</v>

30
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.560
<v Speaker 1>you learn routines and rituals for </v>
<v Speaker 1>structuring the unknown.</v>

31
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.423
<v Speaker 1>Now those are routines and rituals are </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns of action that you use in the </v>

32
00:02:27.851 --> 00:02:31.990
<v Speaker 1>world as such.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also complex patterns of action that</v>

33
00:02:31.991 --> 00:02:32.824
<v Speaker 1>you use to structure your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretations and your own motor </v>

34
00:02:35.561 --> 00:02:38.920
<v Speaker 1>output and your own conceptualizations </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're dealing with other people.</v>

35
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.753
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be the absorption fund</v>
<v Speaker 1>most fundamentally of your cultural </v>

36
00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:43.834
<v Speaker 1>rules and the fact of those cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules and their incarnation in you </v>

37
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.070
<v Speaker 1>essentially keeps chaos at bay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which means if two of you share the same</v>

38
00:02:53.411 --> 00:02:56.320
<v Speaker 1>cultural structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming you're playing the same game,</v>

39
00:02:56.321 --> 00:02:57.154
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means that you can each predict </v>

40
00:02:58.751 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 1>each responses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very,</v>

41
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:01.324
<v Speaker 1>very useful because that way you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be sure that you can trust the </v>

42
00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:04.894
<v Speaker 1>other person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can more or less in further goals </v>

43
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.193
<v Speaker 1>because after all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their value structure of similar to </v>

44
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:10.384
<v Speaker 1>yours and if you can infer their goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means you can embody their </v>

45
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:13.624
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the benevolent aspect of </v>

46
00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:16.451
<v Speaker 1>tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

47
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:18.670
<v Speaker 1>The part that protects and shelters you </v>
<v Speaker 1>instructors,</v>

48
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.030
<v Speaker 1>the nature of your being in the face of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of existential terror and doubts,</v>

49
00:03:23.031 --> 00:03:23.864
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also an aspect of tradition </v>

50
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:29.590
<v Speaker 1>that's terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tyrannical,</v>

51
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:33.990
<v Speaker 1>it's the part that marches young men off</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards say in defense of the structures</v>

52
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 1>that it's protecting.</v>

53
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.063
<v Speaker 1>It's the part that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're a teenager where this and </v>

54
00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:39.154
<v Speaker 1>not this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you'll be the target of mockery for </v>

55
00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:41.854
<v Speaker 1>all your peers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the part of the structure that </v>

56
00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:44.554
<v Speaker 1>crushes the creative life out of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the tyrannical aspect of social </v>

57
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:51.250
<v Speaker 1>order doesn't want your creative light </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

58
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.113
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it wants is your obedience because </v>

59
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.490
<v Speaker 1>you're a bds is what makes the machine </v>
<v Speaker 1>run smooth.</v>

60
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.550
<v Speaker 1>And so you're always in an ambivalent </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with regards to security to</v>

61
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:04.294
<v Speaker 1>authority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand it provides you shelter </v>

62
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:07.294
<v Speaker 1>and what you need and allows you to gain</v>
<v Speaker 1>the benefits of literally thousands and </v>

63
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.670
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years of cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>

64
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:13.743
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the thing that makes you obey or </v>

65
00:04:15.911 --> 00:04:19.150
<v Speaker 1>face the painful consequences thereof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which can range from,</v>

66
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.223
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mere social exclusion and consequent </v>

67
00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:23.730
<v Speaker 1>re-exposure to the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

68
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:24.743
<v Speaker 1>to truly oppressive practices designed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make you be exactly like everyone </v>

69
00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:30.304
<v Speaker 1>else or else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say most particularly </v>

70
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:35.703
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's a standard existential </v>

71
00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:40.870
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a problem that's faced by people in</v>

72
00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:42.520
<v Speaker 1>every place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in every culture,</v>

73
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.640
<v Speaker 1>balancing the appropriate attitude </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards culture.</v>

74
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:51.623
<v Speaker 1>So the most fundamental representation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of culture can be portrayed essentially </v>

75
00:04:55.921 --> 00:04:57.210
<v Speaker 1>in this manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

76
00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:58.643
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you see here is the dragon of </v>

77
00:05:00.751 --> 00:05:01.590
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

78
00:05:01.591 --> 00:05:02.424
<v Speaker 1>lurking in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that all forms </v>

79
00:05:04.591 --> 00:05:09.390
<v Speaker 1>come from the formless and that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>farther itself is a primary form,</v>

80
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.840
<v Speaker 1>a representation of God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The father and God,</v>

81
00:05:12.841 --> 00:05:17.490
<v Speaker 1>the father in the Christian Trinity is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the representation of the positive end,</v>

82
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.533
<v Speaker 1>the security inducing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the tyrannical aspect of social </v>

83
00:05:21.391 --> 00:05:21.931
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

84
00:05:21.931 --> 00:05:22.764
<v Speaker 1>God has a set of rules for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You bloody well better listen to those </v>

85
00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:28.170
<v Speaker 1>rules if you don't all hell's gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>break loose.</v>

86
00:05:28.171 --> 00:05:29.004
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty reasonable summary of </v>

87
00:05:30.301 --> 00:05:34.320
<v Speaker 1>how things work unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on the one hand God offers security.</v>

88
00:05:34.321 --> 00:05:35.154
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he offers tyranny and in total that </v>

89
00:05:37.411 --> 00:05:38.244
<v Speaker 1>basically represents orders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can see this representation is </v>

90
00:05:40.891 --> 00:05:41.760
<v Speaker 1>quite useful.</v>

91
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.020
<v Speaker 1>Chose God's standing over this city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of course is a city,</v>

92
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

93
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.323
<v Speaker 1>committed to him fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it operates under the moral </v>

94
00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:51.954
<v Speaker 1>principles that he represents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And behind him is a representation of </v>

95
00:05:54.391 --> 00:05:55.224
<v Speaker 1>the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is partly a representation of the </v>

96
00:05:57.861 --> 00:06:01.850
<v Speaker 1>source of all life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly a representation of the source of</v>

97
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:03.580
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and illumination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

98
00:06:03.581 --> 00:06:06.200
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're conscious during the day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and partly,</v>

99
00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:06.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

100
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.430
<v Speaker 1>Halo representing the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent nature of the,</v>

101
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.760
<v Speaker 1>of the social order that structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>structures existence.</v>

102
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.120
<v Speaker 1>So it's a primary phenomenon and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>only to say that in all human experience</v>

103
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:20.624
<v Speaker 1>there's a cultural aspect and a natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect and the funny thing is the </v>

104
00:06:24.331 --> 00:06:25.164
<v Speaker 1>cultural aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some ways this as natural as the </v>

105
00:06:26.751 --> 00:06:27.890
<v Speaker 1>natural aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

106
00:06:27.891 --> 00:06:31.550
<v Speaker 1>Because we're social beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't exist without society.</v>

107
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.670
<v Speaker 1>Society structures are very nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ben and were beneficiaries and victims</v>

108
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.870
<v Speaker 1>and so then just as the case just as is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the case with the</v>

109
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.203
<v Speaker 1>feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a two aspects that can be </v>

110
00:06:51.101 --> 00:06:54.310
<v Speaker 1>represented metaphorically with regards </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the masculine.</v>

111
00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:55.390
<v Speaker 1>You can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

112
00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:00.600
<v Speaker 1>the security aspect of social order is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wise king and you could see medieval</v>

113
00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:01.443
<v Speaker 1>representation of a mirror sitting on </v>
<v Speaker 1>his throne calmly in a relatively open </v>

114
00:07:04.781 --> 00:07:05.614
<v Speaker 1>posture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means he's ready to listen to sub </v>

115
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.340
<v Speaker 1>to supplicants to people who are coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk to him.</v>

116
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.460
<v Speaker 1>He's holding an orb with a cross on top </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>

117
00:07:12.461 --> 00:07:13.294
<v Speaker 1>which means essentially that he's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>control of the world and the world is </v>

118
00:07:15.971 --> 00:07:18.790
<v Speaker 1>subordinated to something else that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>represented by the cross,</v>

119
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.913
<v Speaker 1>a wise and just ruler and then his </v>
<v Speaker 1>mirror image here is the sun devouring </v>

120
00:07:24.551 --> 00:07:27.550
<v Speaker 1>king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A very common mythological theme.</v>

121
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.533
<v Speaker 1>The father who wants to destroy his son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's shades of the eatable </v>

122
00:07:31.631 --> 00:07:34.090
<v Speaker 1>conflict in that of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you remember your Freud.</v>

123
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:35.163
<v Speaker 1>But basically what it means is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that despite the fact that every </v>

124
00:07:38.141 --> 00:07:41.380
<v Speaker 1>human being is an offspring of culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>by nature,</v>

125
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:42.723
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every human being is also in the </v>

126
00:07:45.281 --> 00:07:46.114
<v Speaker 1>terrible position of facing the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're very individuality is </v>

127
00:07:48.761 --> 00:07:52.660
<v Speaker 1>likely to be crushed out of them during,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the socialization process.</v>

128
00:07:52.661 --> 00:07:54.480
<v Speaker 1>And that in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really not an,</v>

129
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.470
<v Speaker 1>that's really not avoidable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

130
00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.500
<v Speaker 1>if you're subject to really tear radical</v>
<v Speaker 1>socialization,</v>

131
00:07:59.501 --> 00:08:02.380
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously a much more cardinal </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

132
00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:03.214
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even if you're subject to </v>

133
00:08:04.121 --> 00:08:06.340
<v Speaker 1>socialization under normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances,</v>

134
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.353
<v Speaker 1>you are still what you are rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the manifold things that you could have </v>

135
00:08:11.141 --> 00:08:12.100
<v Speaker 1>otherwise been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

136
00:08:12.101 --> 00:08:12.934
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just to give you some sense of how </v>

137
00:08:14.231 --> 00:08:15.064
<v Speaker 1>dramatic a process this really is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you should know is </v>

138
00:08:19.331 --> 00:08:20.164
<v Speaker 1>that you actually die into your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things you might wonder </v>

139
00:08:24.371 --> 00:08:25.270
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is,</v>

140
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.010
<v Speaker 1>why is it the death evolved?</v>

141
00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:27.843
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really make that much sense </v>

142
00:08:28.511 --> 00:08:29.950
<v Speaker 1>from a Darwinian perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

143
00:08:29.951 --> 00:08:30.784
<v Speaker 1>Because you'd make the presupposition </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you could just stick around and </v>

144
00:08:33.371 --> 00:08:37.390
<v Speaker 1>farther children safe for 250 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be doing a lot better job than the</v>

145
00:08:37.391 --> 00:08:38.224
<v Speaker 1>poor sap who only live to be 30 so why </v>
<v Speaker 1>is it that you only live to be 70 and </v>

146
00:08:42.131 --> 00:08:43.030
<v Speaker 1>really your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

147
00:08:43.031 --> 00:08:46.990
<v Speaker 1>your period of fertility is say by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time you're 40 why would that be?</v>

148
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.200
<v Speaker 1>What's the utility of death?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you remember,</v>

149
00:08:50.201 --> 00:08:53.140
<v Speaker 1>well the environment's always changing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

150
00:08:53.141 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>In this chaotic manner that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>represented the great mother,</v>

151
00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:01.200
<v Speaker 1>can you change with it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is yes,</v>

152
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:05.130
<v Speaker 1>but only to a certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why as people age,</v>

153
00:09:05.131 --> 00:09:08.700
<v Speaker 1>they stay tend to become more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>alienated from the current culture,</v>

154
00:09:08.701 --> 00:09:09.534
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've,</v>

155
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.870
<v Speaker 1>they've adopted their position of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

156
00:09:12.871 --> 00:09:15.870
<v Speaker 1>which is a word more or less fixed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time they're 25 or so.</v>

157
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:17.363
<v Speaker 1>Once their prefrontal cortex matures and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then after that the world gets away </v>

158
00:09:20.071 --> 00:09:20.904
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have enough biological </v>

159
00:09:21.721 --> 00:09:26.721
<v Speaker 1>resources left to constantly undergo new</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary neurological processes.</v>

160
00:09:26.761 --> 00:09:31.740
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have more neural connections in your</v>

161
00:09:31.741 --> 00:09:33.810
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're first born,</v>

162
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.110
<v Speaker 1>then you do for the rest of your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>any other time in your life.</v>

163
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.280
<v Speaker 1>And as you learn when you're an infant </v>
<v Speaker 1>and as you learn,</v>

164
00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.133
<v Speaker 1>say over the first two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that there's a </v>

165
00:09:43.441 --> 00:09:44.274
<v Speaker 1>plentitude of circuits and they die off </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaving only those circuits that have a </v>

166
00:09:48.211 --> 00:09:49.710
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think about that,</v>

167
00:09:49.711 --> 00:09:50.544
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a quasi Darwinian process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that as you </v>

168
00:09:53.431 --> 00:09:56.370
<v Speaker 1>mature and become fixed in your form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

169
00:09:56.371 --> 00:09:59.400
<v Speaker 1>to adopt your personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it becomes,</v>

170
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:00.803
<v Speaker 1>what's happening is that the excess </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility in some sense is being </v>

171
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.080
<v Speaker 1>demolished by experience.</v>

172
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.153
<v Speaker 1>So the [inaudible] aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>enculturation is something that's real </v>

173
00:10:12.001 --> 00:10:15.150
<v Speaker 1>because it makes you in large part what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

174
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:16.223
<v Speaker 1>And you have to understand as well that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's necessary because it's better to </v>

175
00:10:19.531 --> 00:10:20.364
<v Speaker 1>be something in the final analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better to be something than to be </v>

176
00:10:24.811 --> 00:10:27.060
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

177
00:10:27.061 --> 00:10:31.240
<v Speaker 1>we still have residual dreams like those</v>
<v Speaker 1>expressed by Peter Pan,</v>

178
00:10:31.241 --> 00:10:32.074
<v Speaker 1>say who's the boy that never wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>grow up because he doesn't want to </v>

179
00:10:34.111 --> 00:10:34.944
<v Speaker 1>attain any final and fixed form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's interesting because in one </v>

180
00:10:39.421 --> 00:10:41.490
<v Speaker 1>respect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you progress through your life,</v>

181
00:10:41.491 --> 00:10:43.710
<v Speaker 1>you're climbing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming things are going well,</v>

182
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:47.010
<v Speaker 1>you're climbing to ever new heights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But on the other hand,</v>

183
00:10:47.011 --> 00:10:47.844
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the direction that you're going in </v>

184
00:10:49.201 --> 00:10:53.130
<v Speaker 1>constantly narrows as you age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a real trade off there.</v>

185
00:10:53.131 --> 00:10:53.570
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

186
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:54.403
<v Speaker 1>and I think the existential angst that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>caused as a consequence of that trade </v>

187
00:10:57.631 --> 00:10:59.190
<v Speaker 1>off is often real.</v>

188
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:03.360
<v Speaker 1>And I also think that adolescents in </v>
<v Speaker 1>early adults feel this most intently,</v>

189
00:11:03.361 --> 00:11:04.194
<v Speaker 1>which is part of the reason why they </v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to rebel against social structures </v>

190
00:11:07.471 --> 00:11:08.460
<v Speaker 1>in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

191
00:11:08.461 --> 00:11:09.294
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the military industrial </v>

192
00:11:10.231 --> 00:11:13.860
<v Speaker 1>complex or the corporate world or </v>
<v Speaker 1>globalization or what have you,</v>

193
00:11:13.861 --> 00:11:14.694
<v Speaker 1>is that you have these large structures </v>
<v Speaker 1>that represent the tier radical aspect </v>

194
00:11:18.061 --> 00:11:19.110
<v Speaker 1>of social being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

195
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:24.350
<v Speaker 1>and it's no wonder that the fact of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those structures in genders rebellion,</v>

196
00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:26.400
<v Speaker 1>it should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

197
00:11:26.401 --> 00:11:28.710
<v Speaker 1>it's also no wonder that structures like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that exist.</v>

198
00:11:28.711 --> 00:11:29.544
<v Speaker 1>Because if they didn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then people would have no way of </v>

199
00:11:31.921 --> 00:11:34.410
<v Speaker 1>interrelating there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their social being.</v>

200
00:11:34.411 --> 00:11:35.244
<v Speaker 1>And we would revert back to the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hobbsy and state of war where </v>

201
00:11:38.491 --> 00:11:41.160
<v Speaker 1>everybody's arms are around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody else's throat.</v>

202
00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:43.560
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean the payoff is always </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

203
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.130
<v Speaker 1>So for the Floridians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

204
00:11:47.131 --> 00:11:48.760
<v Speaker 1>had a real field day with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

205
00:11:48.761 --> 00:11:49.594
<v Speaker 1>and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're most fundamentally concerned by </v>

206
00:11:51.301 --> 00:11:52.134
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

207
00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.003
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason that Friday and </v>

208
00:11:53.591 --> 00:11:54.424
<v Speaker 1>psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's had such an immense impact on </v>

209
00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:00.310
<v Speaker 1>western and world cultures because Freud</v>
<v Speaker 1>came along just when classical,</v>

210
00:12:00.311 --> 00:12:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Judeo Christian mythological structures </v>
<v Speaker 1>were on the,</v>

211
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:07.000
<v Speaker 1>on a serious decline in the west.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Freud stepped in with a secularized,</v>

212
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:11.110
<v Speaker 1>mythological version version of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which said,</v>

213
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nature knocks the Ed,</v>

214
00:12:13.631 --> 00:12:14.464
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the wild and untamed impulses </v>

215
00:12:15.881 --> 00:12:18.310
<v Speaker 1>that spring up from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the animal mind.</v>

216
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.060
<v Speaker 1>And there's the ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the individual who's,</v>

217
00:12:22.061 --> 00:12:24.910
<v Speaker 1>who's in many ways a pawn of these ed </v>
<v Speaker 1>like forces.</v>

218
00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:28.540
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of the ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crushing it down into the Ed,</v>

219
00:12:28.541 --> 00:12:30.020
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the Superego,</v>

220
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.200
<v Speaker 1>which is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

221
00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:35.110
<v Speaker 1>internal and external embodiment of </v>
<v Speaker 1>social order and morality.</v>

222
00:12:35.111 --> 00:12:38.980
<v Speaker 1>So you can see the mythological </v>
<v Speaker 1>substructure underlying Freud.</v>

223
00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:39.843
<v Speaker 1>Freud said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

224
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.100
<v Speaker 1>the ego is always being shaped by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>superego.</v>

225
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.270
<v Speaker 1>And it's always compulsion.</v>

226
00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.800
<v Speaker 1>It's don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

227
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.060
<v Speaker 1>it's always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

228
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:47.890
<v Speaker 1>it's like Old Testament morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

229
00:12:47.891 --> 00:12:50.320
<v Speaker 1>And the incarnation of the 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>Commandments,</v>

230
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.150
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it feels good,</v>

231
00:12:52.151 --> 00:12:52.984
<v Speaker 1>the probability is high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's immoral from the perspective </v>

232
00:12:55.061 --> 00:12:55.894
<v Speaker 1>of the social world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can really see this with </v>

233
00:12:57.521 --> 00:12:58.360
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

234
00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:02.350
<v Speaker 1>it's really remarkable to watch them </v>
<v Speaker 1>because my sense is,</v>

235
00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:06.010
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think this is just because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a particularly tyrannical farther,</v>

236
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:07.143
<v Speaker 1>is that children often get in more </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble for having fun and they do for </v>

237
00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:11.164
<v Speaker 1>any other reason because their capacity </v>
<v Speaker 1>for unbridled enjoyment is so unbridled </v>

238
00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.250
<v Speaker 1>that it actually poses a threat to </v>
<v Speaker 1>orderly structure.</v>

239
00:13:18.251 --> 00:13:19.084
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a child really gets into inactive </v>

240
00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:23.020
<v Speaker 1>mood and is playing a very active game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

241
00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.600
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're are somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>between say three and five,</v>

242
00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.910
<v Speaker 1>they can tear your house to shreds and </v>
<v Speaker 1>no times,</v>

243
00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:28.870
<v Speaker 1>no time flat.</v>

244
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:30.240
<v Speaker 1>And you're always following them around </v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

245
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.173
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

246
00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.200
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quiet down.</v>

247
00:13:32.201 --> 00:13:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

248
00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:34.354
<v Speaker 1>they're smiling away and they're happier</v>
<v Speaker 1>than any adult you're ever going to see </v>

249
00:13:36.611 --> 00:13:37.444
<v Speaker 1>in your entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're doing everything you can to </v>

250
00:13:39.011 --> 00:13:39.844
<v Speaker 1>push them down so that they can sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>quietly and read a book or whatever it </v>

251
00:13:42.731 --> 00:13:45.700
<v Speaker 1>is you think they should be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really nasty and horrible.</v>

252
00:13:45.701 --> 00:13:46.534
<v Speaker 1>But by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely necessary because if </v>

253
00:13:48.941 --> 00:13:50.830
<v Speaker 1>they don't learn to bring their </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulses,</v>

254
00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.110
<v Speaker 1>even their impulses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're ludic impulses,</v>

255
00:13:53.111 --> 00:13:55.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their impulses to play under control,</v>

256
00:13:55.511 --> 00:13:56.344
<v Speaker 1>then nobody else can stand them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they don't get access to the </v>

257
00:13:58.691 --> 00:14:00.910
<v Speaker 1>resources that are in the social world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

258
00:14:00.911 --> 00:14:02.980
<v Speaker 1>they have one dismal life laid out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of them.</v>

259
00:14:02.981 --> 00:14:03.814
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's an early description of the </v>

260
00:14:06.401 --> 00:14:09.640
<v Speaker 1>genesis of the conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say between the ego and the superego.</v>

261
00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.910
<v Speaker 1>And I just wanted to point that out </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not just sex and aggression</v>

262
00:14:12.911 --> 00:14:14.290
<v Speaker 1>that gets regulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

263
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:16.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can understand why that might happen,</v>

264
00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:17.553
<v Speaker 1>but it's also playfulness and creativity</v>
<v Speaker 1>and spontaneity and all the things that </v>

265
00:14:20.531 --> 00:14:25.531
<v Speaker 1>we associated with the joy of being that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the terrible tyrannical social structure</v>

266
00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:29.320
<v Speaker 1>puts a clamp on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Jaak Panksepp for example,</v>

267
00:14:29.321 --> 00:14:32.350
<v Speaker 1>has recently demonstrated that children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boys,</v>

268
00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:36.220
<v Speaker 1>because it's usually boys who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention deficit disorder,</v>

269
00:14:36.221 --> 00:14:39.190
<v Speaker 1>which is generally diagnosed in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>schoolroom,</v>

270
00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.680
<v Speaker 1>do much better if they're placed on </v>
<v Speaker 1>methylphenidate,</v>

271
00:14:41.681 --> 00:14:44.470
<v Speaker 1>which is a kind of a amphetamine </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>

272
00:14:44.471 --> 00:14:47.080
<v Speaker 1>But normal kids do better on </v>
<v Speaker 1>amphetamines too.</v>

273
00:14:47.081 --> 00:14:48.700
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can focus better,</v>

274
00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.980
<v Speaker 1>they can focus more and they can pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention more.</v>

275
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:54.380
<v Speaker 1>Mostly what methylphenidate does is </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppress play.</v>

276
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.990
<v Speaker 1>So panksepp's notion is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

277
00:14:56.991 --> 00:15:00.020
<v Speaker 1>what's happening with these adhd kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hyperactive kids,</v>

278
00:15:00.021 --> 00:15:02.270
<v Speaker 1>is they're more playful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

279
00:15:02.271 --> 00:15:03.104
<v Speaker 1>more boisterously playful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is tends to be a masculine </v>

280
00:15:05.481 --> 00:15:05.990
<v Speaker 1>attribute.</v>

281
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:08.450
<v Speaker 1>And in the juvenile forms of many </v>
<v Speaker 1>mammals,</v>

282
00:15:08.451 --> 00:15:09.284
<v Speaker 1>they're boisterously playful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give them a little meth methylphenidate </v>

283
00:15:11.601 --> 00:15:15.080
<v Speaker 1>that shuts down their play behavior and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can sit down and focus,</v>

284
00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:16.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and well,</v>

285
00:15:16.221 --> 00:15:19.430
<v Speaker 1>you can understand how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you might think that's necessary</v>

286
00:15:19.431 --> 00:15:20.264
<v Speaker 1>because apparently many people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can also still understand that by </v>

287
00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:24.494
<v Speaker 1>the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that probably represents some kind of </v>

288
00:15:26.241 --> 00:15:27.110
<v Speaker 1>loss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

289
00:15:27.111 --> 00:15:30.290
<v Speaker 1>Because we like to see kids play and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good for them besides,</v>

290
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.190
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud says the ego pops up.</v>

291
00:15:34.191 --> 00:15:35.780
<v Speaker 1>It's all thrilled to death with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

292
00:15:35.781 --> 00:15:36.614
<v Speaker 1>The superego comes along and shuts it </v>
<v Speaker 1>down and now it's a faith that befalls </v>

293
00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.093
<v Speaker 1>all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only that because Freud's a </v>

294
00:15:41.451 --> 00:15:43.400
<v Speaker 1>pretty wise man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all things considered,</v>

295
00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:45.410
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't say that's a whole to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

296
00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:47.910
<v Speaker 1>He says that's the price we pay for </v>
<v Speaker 1>social being.</v>

297
00:15:47.911 --> 00:15:49.040
<v Speaker 1>And Fair enough,</v>

298
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:54.743
<v Speaker 1>you see this happening in children all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time where part of what they do as </v>

299
00:15:57.951 --> 00:15:58.784
<v Speaker 1>they mature as to adopt rules so they'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>play being a father or being a mother </v>

300
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:02.863
<v Speaker 1>say and what they're doing is pulling in</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they see as as the world view that </v>

301
00:16:06.651 --> 00:16:10.280
<v Speaker 1>characterizes parenthood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>embodying the farther,</v>

302
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:11.143
<v Speaker 1>playing out the role and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>organize their motivational structures </v>

303
00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:15.074
<v Speaker 1>within the observed framework say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the father provides and that's an </v>

304
00:16:18.111 --> 00:16:18.944
<v Speaker 1>introjection of social wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can imagine that the role of </v>

305
00:16:21.681 --> 00:16:26.000
<v Speaker 1>fathers say has a structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one structure would be,</v>

306
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.060
<v Speaker 1>well if you're a father and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>around to model,</v>

307
00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.580
<v Speaker 1>then you have to be taken care of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

308
00:16:31.581 --> 00:16:32.414
<v Speaker 1>Or at least you have to be there often </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough so that you can be a target of </v>

309
00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:36.223
<v Speaker 1>modeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can imagine that the spirit </v>

310
00:16:38.451 --> 00:16:42.200
<v Speaker 1>of the father that's modeled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in the optimal circumstances is</v>

311
00:16:42.201 --> 00:16:43.034
<v Speaker 1>one that deals out rules in order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that also provides nurturing care </v>

312
00:16:46.941 --> 00:16:47.630
<v Speaker 1>and support.</v>

313
00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:51.860
<v Speaker 1>And that's a kind of story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know fathers who aren't like that and</v>

314
00:16:51.861 --> 00:16:54.050
<v Speaker 1>maybe we know fathers who are too much </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

315
00:16:54.051 --> 00:16:56.570
<v Speaker 1>but all things considered on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>average,</v>

316
00:16:56.571 --> 00:16:57.404
<v Speaker 1>you have a father role and children </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt to interject that and that's </v>

317
00:17:01.431 --> 00:17:02.264
<v Speaker 1>part of the way that they learn to </v>
<v Speaker 1>modulate their own motivation and </v>

318
00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:05.540
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

319
00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.890
<v Speaker 1>if the child observes the father and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother sharing,</v>

320
00:17:09.891 --> 00:17:13.250
<v Speaker 1>which means taking each other's </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational states into account,</v>

321
00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.730
<v Speaker 1>then they can act out the game of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sharing with a doll,</v>

322
00:17:16.731 --> 00:17:17.564
<v Speaker 1>say representing a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what they're doing is trying to </v>

323
00:17:19.791 --> 00:17:23.030
<v Speaker 1>imagine what it's like inside that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doll's head.</v>

324
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:23.923
<v Speaker 1>Treating it like a person by embodying </v>
<v Speaker 1>the potential motivations and emotional </v>

325
00:17:27.861 --> 00:17:30.410
<v Speaker 1>states of that pretend to object in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own body.</v>

326
00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.560
<v Speaker 1>And then by trying to organize a higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>order structure,</v>

327
00:17:33.561 --> 00:17:34.394
<v Speaker 1>which would be like the tea party where </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tia shared a higher order structure </v>

328
00:17:37.791 --> 00:17:38.624
<v Speaker 1>where you have a turn because you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to turn because you're thirsty like me </v>

329
00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:42.733
<v Speaker 1>and then I have a turn and we both get </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we want and we can exchange </v>

330
00:17:45.081 --> 00:17:45.914
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

331
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:51.400
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a little bit more optimistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the tyranny of social order than pure</v>

332
00:17:51.541 --> 00:17:52.590
<v Speaker 1>compulsion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

333
00:17:52.591 --> 00:17:53.424
<v Speaker 1>Because what it suggests is there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that you can organize the way you </v>

334
00:17:56.761 --> 00:17:57.594
<v Speaker 1>are genuinely and the way I am genuinely</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that we both are genuine yet we get </v>

335
00:18:03.481 --> 00:18:07.290
<v Speaker 1>something more than we would get if we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were just by ourselves.</v>

336
00:18:07.291 --> 00:18:08.124
<v Speaker 1>And so you think that with kids they </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to play by themselves but by the </v>

337
00:18:11.521 --> 00:18:13.890
<v Speaker 1>time they were about three and a half or</v>
<v Speaker 1>four boy,</v>

338
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:14.783
<v Speaker 1>like they have a hunger for other </v>
<v Speaker 1>children and they will do anything in </v>

339
00:18:17.641 --> 00:18:19.650
<v Speaker 1>order to go out and play with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

340
00:18:19.651 --> 00:18:21.450
<v Speaker 1>So you can say to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if you,</v>

341
00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.990
<v Speaker 1>if you take all the toys off your bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go let you play with your friend.</v>

342
00:18:24.991 --> 00:18:25.824
<v Speaker 1>And like the toys are off there in two </v>
<v Speaker 1>tenths of a second and they're out the </v>

343
00:18:27.661 --> 00:18:31.980
<v Speaker 1>door because they have this primary need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go out and experiment with the social</v>

344
00:18:31.981 --> 00:18:36.300
<v Speaker 1>world and in large way in large part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how they build the complex higher</v>

345
00:18:36.301 --> 00:18:37.134
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more abstract structures that enabled </v>

346
00:18:39.031 --> 00:18:41.040
<v Speaker 1>them to regulate their motivated.</v>

347
00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:44.880
<v Speaker 1>They're motivational states and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional states without just,</v>

348
00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.360
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

349
00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.810
<v Speaker 1>it's a more sophisticated way of doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

350
00:18:48.811 --> 00:18:49.644
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better to play a game with someone </v>

351
00:18:50.911 --> 00:18:55.260
<v Speaker 1>then to engage in a battle of wills with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them because then there's no compulsion.</v>

352
00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:56.363
<v Speaker 1>There's just mutual participation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's critical because one of the </v>

353
00:18:59.701 --> 00:19:04.701
<v Speaker 1>things that the notion of the tyranny of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the social order brings up as a question</v>

354
00:19:05.101 --> 00:19:05.611
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

355
00:19:05.611 --> 00:19:08.400
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to take part in society,</v>

356
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:09.623
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have take your part in the social </v>

357
00:19:10.381 --> 00:19:13.590
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet the social world wants it's pound of</v>

358
00:19:13.591 --> 00:19:18.591
<v Speaker 1>flesh or it's 60 pounds of flesh </v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on where you live on the one.</v>

359
00:19:19.231 --> 00:19:22.680
<v Speaker 1>So you're damned if you do so to speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're damned if you don't.</v>

360
00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.520
<v Speaker 1>What do you do as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>facing that challenge?</v>

361
00:19:26.521 --> 00:19:30.690
<v Speaker 1>And so you remember with the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother with chaos and the unknown,</v>

362
00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:31.883
<v Speaker 1>the way you meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the challenges to understand that the </v>

363
00:19:33.901 --> 00:19:36.810
<v Speaker 1>things you don't understand are </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous and frightening,</v>

364
00:19:36.811 --> 00:19:40.320
<v Speaker 1>and that if you encounter them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can hurt you and that this is real,</v>

365
00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.990
<v Speaker 1>but you don't run away all the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

366
00:19:42.991 --> 00:19:46.190
<v Speaker 1>If you're trying to get somewhere and </v>
<v Speaker 1>things you don't understand happen,</v>

367
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.033
<v Speaker 1>you can't shut yourself down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to explore cautiously and try </v>

368
00:19:49.561 --> 00:19:51.390
<v Speaker 1>to gain new knowledge.</v>

369
00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:59.140
<v Speaker 1>How do you organize your social being?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

370
00:19:59.141 --> 00:19:59.974
<v Speaker 1>let's make the presupposition that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got half a dozen or so </v>

371
00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.410
<v Speaker 1>fundamental motivational states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

372
00:20:05.411 --> 00:20:10.240
<v Speaker 1>So what they are is your subjugation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>a world of a priori.</v>

373
00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:13.900
<v Speaker 1>Daddy's right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see in children rage,</v>

374
00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.850
<v Speaker 1>fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunger,</v>

375
00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.250
<v Speaker 1>anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>affiliation,</v>

376
00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:22.780
<v Speaker 1>love the capacity to play all value </v>
<v Speaker 1>sets,</v>

377
00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:27.640
<v Speaker 1>which have their own goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like behavioral patterns,</v>

378
00:20:27.641 --> 00:20:30.340
<v Speaker 1>their own worldview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own way of manifesting themselves.</v>

379
00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.780
<v Speaker 1>All those are innate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

380
00:20:31.781 --> 00:20:36.610
<v Speaker 1>They're all dependent on prewired neural</v>
<v Speaker 1>architectural systems.</v>

381
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.690
<v Speaker 1>They have to unfold inexperienced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're there,</v>

382
00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:40.683
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so let's say that's what you come </v>

383
00:20:41.321 --> 00:20:44.140
<v Speaker 1>into the world with and that's what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>come into the world with and that's what</v>

384
00:20:44.141 --> 00:20:44.974
<v Speaker 1>you come into the world with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the fact that you're in the </v>

385
00:20:46.661 --> 00:20:50.470
<v Speaker 1>world poses a more complex problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

386
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:51.543
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got one motivational state </v>

387
00:20:53.531 --> 00:20:54.640
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're angry,</v>

388
00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:57.010
<v Speaker 1>but then you've got another one you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to worry about,</v>

389
00:20:57.011 --> 00:21:00.400
<v Speaker 1>which is you'd like to be affiliated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with someone like your sibling.</v>

390
00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.440
<v Speaker 1>So you've got a real conflict with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>sibling.</v>

391
00:21:02.441 --> 00:21:03.274
<v Speaker 1>It's like you really hate them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you really liked them too and you </v>

392
00:21:05.891 --> 00:21:08.170
<v Speaker 1>want to play with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do about that?</v>

393
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:09.303
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd say a behaviorally dysregulated </v>

394
00:21:11.501 --> 00:21:14.080
<v Speaker 1>child who isn't well socialized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say they're impulsive,</v>

395
00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:15.453
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't act as if they take the </v>

396
00:21:17.741 --> 00:21:20.110
<v Speaker 1>future into account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they heavily future discount.</v>

397
00:21:20.111 --> 00:21:21.700
<v Speaker 1>They're impulsive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

398
00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.100
<v Speaker 1>Do you watch a child have a temper </v>
<v Speaker 1>tantrum?</v>

399
00:21:24.101 --> 00:21:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Which around too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really prone to.</v>

400
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

401
00:21:28.541 --> 00:21:33.430
<v Speaker 1>it's like a tornado on a real small </v>
<v Speaker 1>scale in the child's just flipped out.</v>

402
00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.100
<v Speaker 1>If you saw an adult do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd run away screaming,</v>

403
00:21:36.101 --> 00:21:40.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're completely dominated by this</v>

404
00:21:40.061 --> 00:21:40.894
<v Speaker 1>emotional state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my sense watching that has always </v>

405
00:21:43.811 --> 00:21:44.644
<v Speaker 1>been to kind of try to help the kid not </v>
<v Speaker 1>have that happen to them because it </v>

406
00:21:46.901 --> 00:21:49.750
<v Speaker 1>looks like a terrible catastrophe for </v>
<v Speaker 1>their emerging eagle,</v>

407
00:21:49.751 --> 00:21:49.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

408
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.823
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to get their world </v>

409
00:21:51.731 --> 00:21:52.564
<v Speaker 1>together and something frustrates them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and womp up come these like a Mig delek </v>

410
00:21:56.051 --> 00:21:56.884
<v Speaker 1>projections that are governing anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamic even more primitive and </v>

411
00:22:00.191 --> 00:22:04.240
<v Speaker 1>just like bull them over and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're on the floor and they're holding</v>

412
00:22:04.241 --> 00:22:06.190
<v Speaker 1>their breath and they're turning blue </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're having a fit.</v>

413
00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.590
<v Speaker 1>And then it takes him like 15 minutes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>recover.</v>

414
00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:13.840
<v Speaker 1>So they have to take themselves into </v>
<v Speaker 1>account as total as complete beings.</v>

415
00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:16.090
<v Speaker 1>And that's the emergence of a higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>order morality.</v>

416
00:22:16.091 --> 00:22:16.924
<v Speaker 1>But it's more complicated than that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because not only do they have the </v>

417
00:22:19.211 --> 00:22:21.550
<v Speaker 1>problem of themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a bad enough problem,</v>

418
00:22:21.551 --> 00:22:23.860
<v Speaker 1>but then they have the problem of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other person.</v>

419
00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:25.563
<v Speaker 1>So what's the proper response of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual given that he or she is </v>

420
00:22:29.711 --> 00:22:30.544
<v Speaker 1>threatened by the natural world and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown on the left hand and threatened </v>

421
00:22:34.241 --> 00:22:37.480
<v Speaker 1>by the social order and it's tyranny on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right hand,</v>

422
00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:38.853
<v Speaker 1>but also dependent on the natural world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and chaos for all good things and all </v>

423
00:22:42.611 --> 00:22:46.780
<v Speaker 1>new information and dependent on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>social order for their very motive being</v>

424
00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:50.890
<v Speaker 1>caught between four paradox is all at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>

425
00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.270
<v Speaker 1>How can that route b property </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiated?</v>

426
00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.433
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can look at hero mythology </v>

427
00:22:57.730 --> 00:22:58.563
<v Speaker 1>and the most tarman plot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would say in some ways the only </v>

428
00:23:04.631 --> 00:23:05.464
<v Speaker 1>plot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although there are variations of this </v>

429
00:23:06.851 --> 00:23:11.851
<v Speaker 1>that are endless romantic variations or </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventure story variations or variations</v>

430
00:23:12.341 --> 00:23:13.174
<v Speaker 1>of failed heroic endeavor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still the only plot goes something like </v>

431
00:23:16.781 --> 00:23:17.614
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a current state of being now </v>

432
00:23:20.271 --> 00:23:23.230
<v Speaker 1>that can be represented by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological state,</v>

433
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:26.770
<v Speaker 1>your current personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be represented by your family.</v>

434
00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:30.070
<v Speaker 1>It can be re represented by your </v>
<v Speaker 1>extended social group,</v>

435
00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:31.690
<v Speaker 1>your city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your town,</v>

436
00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.210
<v Speaker 1>your country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your ecosystem.</v>

437
00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:35.470
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

438
00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:39.730
<v Speaker 1>you're in science fiction frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The entire global community,</v>

439
00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A structure is threatened by what?</v>

440
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you name it,</v>

441
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.440
<v Speaker 1>if it's dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can threaten the structure.</v>

442
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Now it can be one of various forms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>barbarian,</v>

443
00:23:51.921 --> 00:23:52.754
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any person from another culture and </v>

444
00:23:54.501 --> 00:23:56.060
<v Speaker 1>alien in science fiction.</v>

445
00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:57.163
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a terrible monster that lives in the </v>

446
00:23:58.341 --> 00:23:59.174
<v Speaker 1>deep that had been dominated and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>press before but has come back for more </v>

447
00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:04.213
<v Speaker 1>an agent of horror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a common theme in modern horror </v>

448
00:24:06.621 --> 00:24:07.454
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

449
00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:12.230
<v Speaker 1>And object that moves the ghosts in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>basement because the dad were improperly</v>

450
00:24:12.231 --> 00:24:13.680
<v Speaker 1>buried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

451
00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:14.930
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

452
00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.390
<v Speaker 1>Anything uncanny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything fear,</v>

453
00:24:17.391 --> 00:24:19.610
<v Speaker 1>inspiring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything Reptilian,</v>

454
00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:21.123
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that smothers or in trances or </v>

455
00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.113
<v Speaker 1>seduces or you name it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's change or some metaphoric </v>

456
00:24:30.771 --> 00:24:33.350
<v Speaker 1>representation of anything that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>

457
00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:34.573
<v Speaker 1>then it's this the dragon of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing that always </v>

458
00:24:37.371 --> 00:24:38.204
<v Speaker 1>threatens the stable state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's multiple potential manifest </v>

459
00:24:42.651 --> 00:24:44.690
<v Speaker 1>forums.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what does that mean?</v>

460
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:47.660
<v Speaker 1>It means the apocalypse is always </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>

461
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:48.583
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The end of the world is always before </v>

462
00:24:50.571 --> 00:24:51.404
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why you see apocalyptic </v>

463
00:24:52.971 --> 00:24:54.140
<v Speaker 1>imagery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

464
00:24:54.141 --> 00:24:54.974
<v Speaker 1>throughout the New Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ says the world is coming to an </v>

465
00:24:57.591 --> 00:24:59.810
<v Speaker 1>end and people are waiting around for it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to happen.</v>

466
00:24:59.811 --> 00:25:04.160
<v Speaker 1>But what they don't precisely understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the world is always coming to an</v>

467
00:25:04.161 --> 00:25:08.390
<v Speaker 1>end always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because what you think now is</v>

468
00:25:08.391 --> 00:25:10.790
<v Speaker 1>not good enough for the next second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

469
00:25:10.791 --> 00:25:13.100
<v Speaker 1>You have to change because change is </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming.</v>

470
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:16.250
<v Speaker 1>And what change means is you have to let</v>
<v Speaker 1>go of what you know.</v>

471
00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:18.800
<v Speaker 1>That's the apocalypse and it's always on</v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

472
00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.710
<v Speaker 1>The structure is threatened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

473
00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.950
<v Speaker 1>what do you do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

474
00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:26.480
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

475
00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.700
<v Speaker 1>you can run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't hide,</v>

476
00:25:28.701 --> 00:25:30.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the theory.</v>

477
00:25:30.591 --> 00:25:31.424
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that even if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are unwilling to face the threat </v>

478
00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:39.020
<v Speaker 1>that's right in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter where you run to,</v>

479
00:25:39.021 --> 00:25:39.854
<v Speaker 1>that threat is going to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'll see in the case of an </v>

480
00:25:41.721 --> 00:25:42.554
<v Speaker 1>agoraphobic woman who starts to run away</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the shopping mall when she has </v>

481
00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:46.393
<v Speaker 1>heart palpitations that then she runs </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from the subway and then she runs </v>

482
00:25:49.341 --> 00:25:51.830
<v Speaker 1>away from taxis and buses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then other people.</v>

483
00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:53.990
<v Speaker 1>Then finally she's at home and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>nowhere to run,</v>

484
00:25:53.991 --> 00:25:57.800
<v Speaker 1>but her heart's palpitating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fear of death is still honor and</v>

485
00:25:57.801 --> 00:26:02.000
<v Speaker 1>there's no place to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So hiding isn't much of a help.</v>

486
00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:05.780
<v Speaker 1>Or you can pretend that the chaotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing isn't there and refuse to change,</v>

487
00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:09.590
<v Speaker 1>but all that does is make the threat </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.</v>

488
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:10.423
<v Speaker 1>So just like simply put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say you only have $100 in the bank </v>

489
00:26:14.661 --> 00:26:17.600
<v Speaker 1>and you have $110 telephone bill and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

490
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:18.583
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like that $100 I'm not going to pay </v>

491
00:26:20.181 --> 00:26:22.610
<v Speaker 1>that telephone bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a little threat,</v>

492
00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you don't pay it,</v>

493
00:26:24.261 --> 00:26:25.094
<v Speaker 1>and the next month it's $125 telephone </v>
<v Speaker 1>bill and then they slap a $50 charge on </v>

494
00:26:29.001 --> 00:26:31.820
<v Speaker 1>you and then they cut off your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you don't have a phone.</v>

495
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.670
<v Speaker 1>Then you miss a job appointment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not so good.</v>

496
00:26:34.671 --> 00:26:35.504
<v Speaker 1>And then it's $250 to pay your phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>bill and another 200 to get it hooked </v>

497
00:26:39.081 --> 00:26:39.914
<v Speaker 1>back up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then your credit record goes all to </v>

498
00:26:41.421 --> 00:26:43.230
<v Speaker 1>hell because you haven't paid any of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

499
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:47.040
<v Speaker 1>Then you can't buy a house when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>25 and you think kind of weird.</v>

500
00:26:47.041 --> 00:26:50.490
<v Speaker 1>A little bitty chaos turns into a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>big monster.</v>

501
00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:55.500
<v Speaker 1>And partly that's because everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that looks separate from everything else</v>

502
00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.780
<v Speaker 1>isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just looks that way.</v>

503
00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:58.793
<v Speaker 1>And when you ignore anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's impeding your </v>

504
00:27:02.341 --> 00:27:04.500
<v Speaker 1>progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it's impeding your progress.</v>

505
00:27:04.501 --> 00:27:06.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to deal with it,</v>

506
00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.750
<v Speaker 1>step away from it and see what its true </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature really is.</v>

507
00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:10.793
<v Speaker 1>So you can hide and you can not change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or You could pretend that the threat </v>

508
00:27:13.681 --> 00:27:14.514
<v Speaker 1>doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in the final analysis that just </v>

509
00:27:17.581 --> 00:27:19.740
<v Speaker 1>stores up the catastrophe for later.</v>
