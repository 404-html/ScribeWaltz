1
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.220
<v Speaker 1>Come to the end of the year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to talk to you a little bit</v>

2
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:12.720
<v Speaker 1>about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole course today,</v>

3
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.230
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and trying to sum up what</v>

4
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.090
<v Speaker 1>might be most useful to remember about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it</v>

5
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.083
<v Speaker 1>and when we started at the beginning I </v>
<v Speaker 1>made the case to you that people have </v>

6
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:32.064
<v Speaker 1>been studying personality and its </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformations for a very long period </v>

7
00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:37.164
<v Speaker 1>of time and that the earliest</v>
<v Speaker 1>forms of knowledge that we have about </v>

8
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.140
<v Speaker 1>what people are liking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they change</v>

9
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.450
<v Speaker 1>come to us from stories and from very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very old stories</v>

10
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.933
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

11
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.893
<v Speaker 1>it was stories represent how people act </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world fundamentally rather than </v>

12
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.483
<v Speaker 1>what the world is made of</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that people are confused </v>

13
00:01:13.511 --> 00:01:18.511
<v Speaker 1>about that is part of the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still tremendous confusion about</v>

14
00:01:18.581 --> 00:01:22.390
<v Speaker 1>the proper relationship between science </v>
<v Speaker 1>and religion or science and ethics.</v>

15
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.490
<v Speaker 1>Almost all of the</v>

16
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.823
<v Speaker 1>forms of information transfer that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>regard as engaging our narrative in </v>

17
00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:33.884
<v Speaker 1>their format.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We love stories and the reason for that </v>

18
00:01:37.431 --> 00:01:41.630
<v Speaker 1>is that stories tell us how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what people are like and how they behave</v>

19
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.140
<v Speaker 1>and they present the world as a place in</v>
<v Speaker 1>which people behave.</v>

20
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.920
<v Speaker 1>And so the stories help us understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>how people behave,</v>

21
00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:59.081
<v Speaker 1>but they also help us understand how </v>
<v Speaker 1>people must and should behave given that</v>

22
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.903
<v Speaker 1>they have a certain nature and that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to organize their behavior with </v>

23
00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:06.584
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that puts a set of very serious </v>

24
00:02:09.351 --> 00:02:14.351
<v Speaker 1>constraints on how it is that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>can exist in the world.</v>

25
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.563
<v Speaker 1>The story's basically take two forms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One form is the description of people </v>

26
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.530
<v Speaker 1>acting in motivated states of one form </v>
<v Speaker 1>or another,</v>

27
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.570
<v Speaker 1>and those are usually motivated states </v>
<v Speaker 1>that everyone is familiar with.</v>

28
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.310
<v Speaker 1>Most stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they're archaic or modern,</v>

29
00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:44.460
<v Speaker 1>have to do with exploration and </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventure or romance,</v>

30
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.680
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is that</v>

31
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.130
<v Speaker 2>we're.</v>

32
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.130
<v Speaker 1>We're biologically constructed so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were adventuresome,</v>

33
00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.970
<v Speaker 1>exploratory and interested in intimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships and so the stories reflect</v>

34
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:07.750
<v Speaker 1>that and they help us understand</v>

35
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.423
<v Speaker 3>how</v>

36
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.363
<v Speaker 1>those fundamental motivations could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifested in behavior in a manner </v>

37
00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:16.174
<v Speaker 1>that's productive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly for each individual and then </v>

38
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:26.971
<v Speaker 1>partly for the individuals in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to other individuals and to</v>

39
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:32.461
<v Speaker 1>families and to broader communities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other form of story that seems to be</v>

40
00:03:36.751 --> 00:03:37.584
<v Speaker 1>of critical importance from a historical</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective is stories that describe </v>

41
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.830
<v Speaker 1>transformation and transformation tends </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be represented as I'm</v>

42
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:50.693
<v Speaker 1>using symbolism that's associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>death and rebirth and the reason for </v>

43
00:03:55.141 --> 00:03:56.520
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be that</v>

44
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.990
<v Speaker 1>almost inevitably when you learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>something new,</v>

45
00:04:03.991 --> 00:04:04.824
<v Speaker 1>you learn it because something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing or something that you're </v>

46
00:04:06.901 --> 00:04:09.750
<v Speaker 1>using to structure your perceptions no </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer works,</v>

47
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.590
<v Speaker 1>so pursuit produces a result that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't intend.</v>

48
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.150
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before you can learn to restructure your</v>

49
00:04:18.151 --> 00:04:18.984
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to allow yourself to let go of </v>

50
00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:23.910
<v Speaker 1>the things that you're doing that are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>error.</v>

51
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:30.000
<v Speaker 1>And those can be small things in </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations where only a small correction</v>

52
00:04:30.001 --> 00:04:30.834
<v Speaker 1>is required.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes they can be very large </v>

53
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:33.334
<v Speaker 1>space and if they're very large things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's as if there's a large element </v>

54
00:04:38.731 --> 00:04:39.564
<v Speaker 1>of your personality or yourself that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>to degenerate and transform itself into </v>

55
00:04:44.281 --> 00:04:48.030
<v Speaker 1>chaos and then reemerge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully restructured</v>

56
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.943
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

57
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.843
<v Speaker 1>the archaic stories about death and </v>
<v Speaker 1>rebirth and the transfiguration of the </v>

58
00:04:55.031 --> 00:05:00.031
<v Speaker 1>soul are stories about the necessity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>disillusion and disintegration preceding</v>

59
00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:03.694
<v Speaker 1>asset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a very useful thing to know </v>

60
00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:07.240
<v Speaker 1>because it means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

61
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:08.074
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to be resistant to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning things as you progress through </v>

62
00:05:13.121 --> 00:05:15.610
<v Speaker 1>life because every time you learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

63
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:16.444
<v Speaker 1>you have to let go of something that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold dear before you can reconstruct </v>

64
00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:20.044
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that accounts for people's </v>

65
00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:25.990
<v Speaker 1>unwillingness to learn things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unwillingness to face facts that don't,</v>

66
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.290
<v Speaker 1>that aren't in accordance with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>current view of the world.</v>

67
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.123
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

68
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:33.663
<v Speaker 1>but it also helps you understand that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be worth letting go of the things </v>

69
00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:37.624
<v Speaker 1>that you're doing that aren't productive</v>
<v Speaker 1>because even if it's painful in the </v>

70
00:05:39.641 --> 00:05:40.474
<v Speaker 1>short term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the consequence might be the kind of </v>

71
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.660
<v Speaker 1>personality transfer information that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stops you from having to suffer stupidly</v>

72
00:05:46.661 --> 00:05:49.040
<v Speaker 1>as you move through life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In.</v>

73
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.103
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>titled This Course Personality and its </v>

74
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:55.114
<v Speaker 1>transformations is because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation part of the study of </v>

75
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:00.074
<v Speaker 1>personality is probably more important </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the study of personality traits </v>

76
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:05.060
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is part of the reason why,</v>

77
00:06:05.061 --> 00:06:05.894
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Piaget thought it was much more </v>

78
00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:11.030
<v Speaker 1>important to learn how it was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people learn things,</v>

79
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.400
<v Speaker 1>that it was to learn what they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning.</v>

80
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.893
<v Speaker 1>So he was more concerned about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process by which people generate </v>

81
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:20.420
<v Speaker 1>information and transform their </v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities.</v>

82
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:21.254
<v Speaker 1>Then he was in determining the nature of</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever theory it was that people </v>

83
00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:26.024
<v Speaker 1>happen to be using to interact with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world at a particular historical stage </v>

84
00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:32.300
<v Speaker 1>or at a particular developmental stage.</v>

85
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.823
<v Speaker 1>And I think one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>most important to learn from our CAC </v>

86
00:06:36.651 --> 00:06:38.300
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is where we started this,</v>

87
00:06:38.301 --> 00:06:39.900
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

88
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.383
<v Speaker 1>it's much more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's much more useful to envision </v>

89
00:06:43.731 --> 00:06:44.564
<v Speaker 1>yourself as something that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>continually transform in response to </v>

90
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:49.184
<v Speaker 1>challenge than it is to view yourself as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the static embodiment of any particular </v>

91
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.100
<v Speaker 1>strategy of knowledge or perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

92
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.230
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you'll see quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequently,</v>

93
00:07:00.231 --> 00:07:02.150
<v Speaker 1>and you certainly see this in </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities now,</v>

94
00:07:02.151 --> 00:07:02.984
<v Speaker 1>I think perhaps you see that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university is more than you see it </v>

95
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.500
<v Speaker 1>anywhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that people adopt astatic ideological</v>

96
00:07:09.501 --> 00:07:12.740
<v Speaker 1>stance on the world and they try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpret everything that happens in the</v>

97
00:07:12.741 --> 00:07:15.260
<v Speaker 1>world through the lens of that static </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology.</v>

98
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:16.423
<v Speaker 1>They try to compress the entire world </v>
<v Speaker 1>into that particular theoretical </v>

99
00:07:19.161 --> 00:07:19.994
<v Speaker 1>framework and become extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>upset when the phenomena that confront </v>

100
00:07:24.021 --> 00:07:24.854
<v Speaker 1>them don't fit in accordance with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology and the reason that people do </v>

101
00:07:28.431 --> 00:07:29.264
<v Speaker 1>that is because they identify themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their ideological beliefs and </v>

102
00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:34.460
<v Speaker 1>they're static ideological beliefs.</v>

103
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:35.443
<v Speaker 1>Instead of identifying themselves with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the part of their personality that's </v>

104
00:07:38.331 --> 00:07:39.164
<v Speaker 1>capable of continually assimilating new </v>
<v Speaker 1>information and accommodating to it or </v>

105
00:07:43.161 --> 00:07:47.120
<v Speaker 1>transforming and you're much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful person.</v>

106
00:07:47.121 --> 00:07:47.954
<v Speaker 1>If you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can understand that what's most </v>

107
00:07:51.561 --> 00:07:52.394
<v Speaker 1>essential to you as your capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>transmute and transform as challenges </v>

108
00:07:56.931 --> 00:08:01.931
<v Speaker 1>come towards you rather than your </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to to develop a coherent and all</v>

109
00:08:02.751 --> 00:08:06.710
<v Speaker 1>encompassing totalitarian theory and </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt to impose it on the world.</v>

110
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:12.440
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the most tragic</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakes that modern universities make,</v>

111
00:08:15.201 --> 00:08:17.900
<v Speaker 1>especially on the humanities ends of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>

112
00:08:17.901 --> 00:08:22.280
<v Speaker 1>is that people come to university </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for orientation in the world,</v>

113
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.143
<v Speaker 1>looking for ways of understanding it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and essentially they're taught two </v>

114
00:08:25.461 --> 00:08:26.294
<v Speaker 1>things and one is that there is no </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental meaning to things and so </v>

115
00:08:29.271 --> 00:08:33.500
<v Speaker 1>that if your rationalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're rational and intelligent,</v>

116
00:08:33.501 --> 00:08:36.740
<v Speaker 1>being that you're only reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>outlook is nihilistic,</v>

117
00:08:36.741 --> 00:08:40.940
<v Speaker 1>and then what seems to go along with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is some insistence that you adopt a</v>

118
00:08:40.941 --> 00:08:44.630
<v Speaker 1>particular ideological stance as some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of counter position to that.</v>

119
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:48.230
<v Speaker 1>And to me that has nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>education at all.</v>

120
00:08:48.231 --> 00:08:49.290
<v Speaker 1>That's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>

121
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.193
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's corruption from both directions </v>

122
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:56.370
<v Speaker 1>because there was no real utility and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilism and there's no reason to assume</v>

123
00:08:56.371 --> 00:08:58.230
<v Speaker 1>that it's the appropriate stance on </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

124
00:08:58.231 --> 00:08:59.064
<v Speaker 1>And everything we've learned from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>20th century indicates that there's </v>

125
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:02.483
<v Speaker 1>virtually nothing that you can do that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>more dangerous personally and socially </v>

126
00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:06.144
<v Speaker 1>than to grasp an ideology and to attempt</v>
<v Speaker 1>to apply it to everything that comes </v>

127
00:09:09.781 --> 00:09:10.614
<v Speaker 1>your way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the fact that universities teach </v>

128
00:09:12.661 --> 00:09:14.590
<v Speaker 1>people how to do that in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable.</v>

129
00:09:14.591 --> 00:09:15.424
<v Speaker 1>Rick reasonably rigorous way is I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing short of appalling and I think </v>

130
00:09:20.221 --> 00:09:21.054
<v Speaker 1>the only way that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can transcend that is to </v>

131
00:09:23.731 --> 00:09:28.731
<v Speaker 1>understand that what you know is not as </v>
<v Speaker 1>important as what you yet,</v>

132
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:33.890
<v Speaker 1>what you have yet to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what that means is that you can.</v>

133
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:39.650
<v Speaker 1>People often find strength in regarding </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves as the sort of being that can</v>

134
00:09:40.351 --> 00:09:44.130
<v Speaker 1>comprehend everything and that's that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of being that's competent.</v>

135
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.880
<v Speaker 1>And and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what would you say,</v>

136
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:48.923
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently well developed at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>current point so that they have the </v>

137
00:09:51.301 --> 00:09:53.400
<v Speaker 1>appropriate answers to the appropriate </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

138
00:09:53.401 --> 00:09:54.234
<v Speaker 1>But the thing about that that's wrong is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't have the answers and </v>

139
00:09:57.241 --> 00:09:58.074
<v Speaker 1>often you don't even have the questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you can identify it with your </v>

140
00:10:01.171 --> 00:10:02.004
<v Speaker 1>capacity to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means that you don't have to be </v>

141
00:10:03.751 --> 00:10:05.610
<v Speaker 1>afraid of the things that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

142
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:06.713
<v Speaker 1>And that means that you can listen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and you can discover new things </v>

143
00:10:09.211 --> 00:10:13.200
<v Speaker 1>and that you can continually make your </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality expand and transform.</v>

144
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.580
<v Speaker 1>And we have no idea what the limits are </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the human capacity to transfer,</v>

145
00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:21.020
<v Speaker 1>to expand and transform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're,</v>

146
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:21.913
<v Speaker 1>you're much more powerful from an </v>
<v Speaker 1>existential perspective if you regard </v>

147
00:10:24.751 --> 00:10:25.584
<v Speaker 1>yourself as the sort of person who can </v>
<v Speaker 1>surf on change rather than someone who </v>

148
00:10:30.391 --> 00:10:34.020
<v Speaker 1>has to make everything static and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unchangeable just so that they can adapt</v>

149
00:10:34.021 --> 00:10:34.854
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>

150
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:40.580
<v Speaker 1>So I learned a lot of that from reading </v>
<v Speaker 1>archaic stories and trying to understand</v>

151
00:10:41.011 --> 00:10:43.020
<v Speaker 1>exactly what it was that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to,</v>

152
00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:44.363
<v Speaker 1>to communicate to people and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental communication is that it's </v>

153
00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:53.610
<v Speaker 1>reasonable to conceptualize the world as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a place of action rather than a place of</v>

154
00:10:54.151 --> 00:10:54.984
<v Speaker 1>objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then to regard the central problem </v>

155
00:10:57.301 --> 00:10:58.134
<v Speaker 1>of human life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the existential problem as how is it </v>

156
00:11:01.351 --> 00:11:04.980
<v Speaker 1>that you should look in the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the world and act on it,</v>

157
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:06.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

158
00:11:06.811 --> 00:11:09.210
<v Speaker 1>and from a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a scientific perspective,</v>

159
00:11:09.211 --> 00:11:10.044
<v Speaker 1>that's generally regarded as something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's at the phenomenal because </v>

160
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:17.930
<v Speaker 1>behavioral analysis of appropriate </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior falls into the domain of ethics</v>

161
00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:19.284
<v Speaker 1>and philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's foolish for people because </v>

162
00:11:21.301 --> 00:11:22.134
<v Speaker 1>everything we do revolves around how we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to look at the world and how we </v>

163
00:11:24.871 --> 00:11:29.430
<v Speaker 1>have to act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is part of the reason that I talked</v>

164
00:11:29.431 --> 00:11:30.264
<v Speaker 1>to you about piaget because I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>piaget had had had cottoned onto </v>

165
00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:35.694
<v Speaker 1>something that was unbelievably profound</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's an element of getting and </v>

166
00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.240
<v Speaker 1>thinking that generally you don't hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>much about.</v>

167
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.073
<v Speaker 1>If you take courses on piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in relationship to </v>

168
00:11:46.141 --> 00:11:46.974
<v Speaker 1>developmental psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially North Americans like to </v>

169
00:11:49.141 --> 00:11:54.141
<v Speaker 1>reduce piaget to a list of developmental</v>
<v Speaker 1>stages and that is something that piaget</v>

170
00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:55.714
<v Speaker 1>really wasn't all that concerned about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was interested in how the processes </v>

171
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:00.303
<v Speaker 1>that people use or how the structures </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people use to interpret the world </v>

172
00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:07.150
<v Speaker 1>transform across time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't particularly interested in</v>

173
00:12:07.151 --> 00:12:10.630
<v Speaker 1>exactly what those stages were and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>they see actually followed.</v>

174
00:12:10.631 --> 00:12:15.400
<v Speaker 1>One another and piaget is a fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea was that</v>

175
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:17.763
<v Speaker 1>there were ways of organizing complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems that could sustain themselves </v>

176
00:12:22.691 --> 00:12:27.310
<v Speaker 1>with very little input of energy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>effort and resources</v>

177
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:29.643
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that those forms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization exists meant that some </v>

178
00:12:32.831 --> 00:12:35.440
<v Speaker 1>forms of organization were better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

179
00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.250
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that that's so important </v>
<v Speaker 1>is because piaget,</v>

180
00:12:39.251 --> 00:12:40.084
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is one of the only thing that I've ever </v>

181
00:12:41.231 --> 00:12:42.064
<v Speaker 1>come across that managed to transform </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you might think about as a </v>

182
00:12:45.851 --> 00:12:48.430
<v Speaker 1>qualitative evaluation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so an evaluation,</v>

183
00:12:48.431 --> 00:12:51.880
<v Speaker 1>say of the appropriateness of a solution</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a problem,</v>

184
00:12:51.881 --> 00:12:52.960
<v Speaker 1>like a moral problem.</v>

185
00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:54.243
<v Speaker 1>He managed to transform the discussion </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that into something that was </v>

186
00:12:56.591 --> 00:12:57.424
<v Speaker 1>virtually quantitative and so piaget's </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of the equivalent rated state was </v>

187
00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:07.180
<v Speaker 1>the notion that you could set up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated system so that all the parts</v>

188
00:13:07.181 --> 00:13:08.014
<v Speaker 1>of the system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're operating in some kind of </v>

189
00:13:09.011 --> 00:13:09.844
<v Speaker 1>harmonious balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the system wasn't continually </v>

190
00:13:12.371 --> 00:13:17.371
<v Speaker 1>fighting itself either at any given </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment in time or in multiple situations</v>

191
00:13:17.801 --> 00:13:18.634
<v Speaker 1>across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for Piaget and celebrated state </v>

192
00:13:21.131 --> 00:13:26.131
<v Speaker 1>was the state was a state that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively free of conflict and so it's,</v>

193
00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:27.183
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started with piaget instead of Freud </v>

194
00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.420
<v Speaker 1>because because people often start </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality courses with Freud.</v>

195
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:37.210
<v Speaker 1>Piaget actually had the model for how </v>
<v Speaker 1>people organize themselves.</v>

196
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:38.583
<v Speaker 1>I think he had a more accurate </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of the model of how </v>

197
00:13:40.781 --> 00:13:42.760
<v Speaker 1>people organize themselves than Freud </v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

198
00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:46.900
<v Speaker 1>Now you know that Freud conceptualize </v>
<v Speaker 1>people as an ego,</v>

199
00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.113
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>With tremendous id like forces </v>

200
00:13:50.171 --> 00:13:51.004
<v Speaker 1>underneath pushing the ego around and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>would think about those as classical </v>

201
00:13:54.581 --> 00:13:55.414
<v Speaker 1>biologically motivated or biologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicated motivations like aggression </v>

202
00:13:59.561 --> 00:14:00.394
<v Speaker 1>and sexuality and all of the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of our motivated behavior that </v>

203
00:14:03.881 --> 00:14:05.890
<v Speaker 1>make us animal like Freud thought.</v>

204
00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:09.940
<v Speaker 1>If the ego is trapped between those and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the demands of the social world.</v>

205
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.073
<v Speaker 1>And so he thought of that as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intrinsically conflict laden process </v>

206
00:14:15.161 --> 00:14:17.830
<v Speaker 1>where you know you're trying to manifest</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

207
00:14:17.831 --> 00:14:22.420
<v Speaker 1>You have your animal instincts as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an animalistic individual and society</v>

208
00:14:22.421 --> 00:14:26.860
<v Speaker 1>is attempting to him that in and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>repress it and and inhibited.</v>

209
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:31.890
<v Speaker 1>Because as a pure manifestation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological and melody,</v>

210
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.790
<v Speaker 1>you're dangerous and not properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

211
00:14:35.791 --> 00:14:36.624
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't fit into a social environment </v>

212
00:14:38.321 --> 00:14:39.154
<v Speaker 1>without inhibiting that are sublimating </v>
<v Speaker 1>it or transforming it at some in some </v>

213
00:14:43.061 --> 00:14:45.830
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the Piagetian perspective is,</v>

214
00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.060
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

215
00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:51.830
<v Speaker 1>is more something that's predicated on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of a game.</v>

216
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:53.593
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's a more sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of looking at it because when you </v>

217
00:14:57.171 --> 00:14:59.510
<v Speaker 1>look at how children organized their </v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities,</v>

218
00:14:59.511 --> 00:15:01.910
<v Speaker 1>especially between the ages of two and </v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

219
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:04.490
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly the case that to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>

220
00:15:04.491 --> 00:15:08.960
<v Speaker 1>they learned to inhibit their impulses </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of social pressure.</v>

221
00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:09.793
<v Speaker 1>But it's much more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's much more appropriate and accurate </v>

222
00:15:14.001 --> 00:15:14.834
<v Speaker 1>to notice that actually what they mostly</v>
<v Speaker 1>learned to do between the ages of two </v>

223
00:15:18.591 --> 00:15:22.820
<v Speaker 1>and four is get along with themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>and get along with others.</v>

224
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.710
<v Speaker 1>And so what's happening is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

225
00:15:24.711 --> 00:15:25.544
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they burst onto the world with a set of </v>

226
00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:32.390
<v Speaker 1>sub personalities that are predicated in</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological reality.</v>

227
00:15:32.391 --> 00:15:33.224
<v Speaker 1>So they're hungry and they're thirsty </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have to maintain their body </v>

228
00:15:35.331 --> 00:15:36.164
<v Speaker 1>temperature to a certain level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they have to learn how to cope with </v>

229
00:15:39.321 --> 00:15:42.250
<v Speaker 1>all of the demands of being a biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>entity like,</v>

230
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.840
<v Speaker 1>like toilet training and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

231
00:15:44.841 --> 00:15:45.674
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning how to share and learning how </v>

232
00:15:47.001 --> 00:15:47.834
<v Speaker 1>to play with siblings and establishing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with parents and so forth </v>

233
00:15:50.511 --> 00:15:51.344
<v Speaker 1>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the way they seem to do that is by </v>

234
00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:58.130
<v Speaker 1>organizing their behavior into more and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more complicated and sophisticated games</v>

235
00:15:58.131 --> 00:16:00.820
<v Speaker 1>that stack on top of one another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

236
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:05.830
<v Speaker 1>so the child learns how to regulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>their biological rhythms and go to sleep</v>

237
00:16:06.231 --> 00:16:07.064
<v Speaker 1>at the appropriate time and wake up at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the appropriate time and if the parents </v>

238
00:16:09.921 --> 00:16:10.754
<v Speaker 1>scaffold them properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they learned to eat at the proper </v>

239
00:16:12.771 --> 00:16:15.020
<v Speaker 1>time so that so that the.</v>

240
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:16.340
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

241
00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.970
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not dysregulated by,</v>

242
00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.193
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by starvation or hunger or thirst and </v>

243
00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:24.223
<v Speaker 1>they're not dysregulated by temperature </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremes and they learned how to </v>

244
00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:28.933
<v Speaker 1>incorporate their aggression into </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperative games rather than how to </v>

245
00:16:33.081 --> 00:16:33.914
<v Speaker 1>inhibit it and they make their </v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities more and more </v>

246
00:16:36.261 --> 00:16:37.094
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated as they're doing that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they learn how to play a larger and </v>

247
00:16:39.561 --> 00:16:40.394
<v Speaker 1>larger number of more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated games with more and more </v>

248
00:16:43.431 --> 00:16:44.264
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a kind of hierarchical </v>

249
00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:46.964
<v Speaker 1>organization that extends inside the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person in so far as they're organizing </v>

250
00:16:51.681 --> 00:16:52.514
<v Speaker 1>their fundamental biological motivations</v>
<v Speaker 1>and their emotions and then starts to </v>

251
00:16:55.881 --> 00:16:56.714
<v Speaker 1>extend beyond the individual as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to organize their fundamental </v>

252
00:17:00.531 --> 00:17:02.600
<v Speaker 1>motivations and their emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

253
00:17:02.601 --> 00:17:07.601
<v Speaker 1>other people are doing the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's out of that continual interplay</v>

254
00:17:07.731 --> 00:17:08.564
<v Speaker 1>of game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like cooperation and competition that </v>

255
00:17:10.731 --> 00:17:11.564
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that society itself emerges and that's </v>

256
00:17:13.401 --> 00:17:18.200
<v Speaker 1>not on an inhibitory or conflict laden </v>
<v Speaker 1>model.</v>

257
00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.273
<v Speaker 1>The conflict between society and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual in the Piagetian model only </v>

258
00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:23.533
<v Speaker 1>occurs when the when the game like </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of the personality is not </v>

259
00:17:27.951 --> 00:17:28.784
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated enough to interact </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly with the environment at that </v>

260
00:17:31.521 --> 00:17:32.354
<v Speaker 1>point and so you can see that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the idea of a pig and equilibrated </v>

261
00:17:37.041 --> 00:17:37.874
<v Speaker 1>state is that you could imagine an </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual at all of the levels of </v>

262
00:17:41.181 --> 00:17:44.300
<v Speaker 1>existence that the individual exists at </v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

263
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:45.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the micro caused them the micro world </v>

264
00:17:47.721 --> 00:17:50.670
<v Speaker 1>way down at the Subatomic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the atomic level,</v>

265
00:17:50.671 --> 00:17:51.504
<v Speaker 1>stacked up on top of each other all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way up to the societal level so that </v>

266
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.273
<v Speaker 1>everything in that hierarchical </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization organization is working to </v>

267
00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:04.320
<v Speaker 1>make every level work properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

268
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.680
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a really good model for,</v>

269
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:11.040
<v Speaker 1>for what you might conceptualize as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

270
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.470
<v Speaker 1>as mental health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Broadly speaking.</v>

271
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.903
<v Speaker 1>Because your mental health is of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent on the appropriate </v>

272
00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:20.340
<v Speaker 1>organization of your psychophysiology.</v>

273
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.173
<v Speaker 1>But it's also dependent on the earth and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the integration of that organized </v>

274
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:25.013
<v Speaker 1>psychophysiology into an intimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship and then into a familial </v>

275
00:18:28.801 --> 00:18:29.634
<v Speaker 1>relationship and into a relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the community and then into a </v>

276
00:18:32.491 --> 00:18:35.820
<v Speaker 1>relationship with the structures that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are beyond the community.</v>

277
00:18:35.821 --> 00:18:38.450
<v Speaker 1>And you know the fact that many of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>concern,</v>

278
00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:41.640
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with environmental issues means that you</v>

279
00:18:41.641 --> 00:18:45.960
<v Speaker 1>understand at some level that in order </v>
<v Speaker 1>for your being to be optimized,</v>

280
00:18:45.961 --> 00:18:46.794
<v Speaker 1>you also have to exist in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively harmonious manner inside </v>

281
00:18:50.581 --> 00:18:51.414
<v Speaker 1>large biological ecosystems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So economic ecosystems and political </v>

282
00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:56.363
<v Speaker 1>ecosystems and social ecosystems and </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological ecosystems and all of those </v>

283
00:19:00.781 --> 00:19:03.000
<v Speaker 1>levels have to be stacked on top of one </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

284
00:19:03.001 --> 00:19:06.390
<v Speaker 1>So each level supports and fosters all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other levels.</v>

285
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:07.703
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very complicated thing to </v>

286
00:19:10.081 --> 00:19:10.914
<v Speaker 1>attain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also something that has to be </v>

287
00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:17.820
<v Speaker 1>continually negotiate it and transformed</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of course you're trying to stack</v>

288
00:19:17.821 --> 00:19:20.580
<v Speaker 1>all these processes in a hierarchical </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner,</v>

289
00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:25.500
<v Speaker 1>in a self sustaining hierarchical manner</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an environment that also continues to</v>

290
00:19:25.501 --> 00:19:26.670
<v Speaker 1>shift and move.</v>

291
00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:31.850
<v Speaker 1>So not only do you have to stack up this</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure to begin with and and organize</v>

292
00:19:32.071 --> 00:19:34.410
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to transform it at whatever</v>

293
00:19:34.411 --> 00:19:39.030
<v Speaker 1>level needs to be transformed as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>move throughout the dynamic environment.</v>

294
00:19:39.031 --> 00:19:42.720
<v Speaker 1>That changes from day to day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very complicated process.</v>

295
00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:48.290
<v Speaker 1>Now it seems to me that that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you can come to understand,</v>

296
00:19:48.901 --> 00:19:51.150
<v Speaker 1>and this is something that I took at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least in part from,</v>

297
00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:56.540
<v Speaker 1>from reading you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that that the process that you engage</v>

298
00:19:56.611 --> 00:19:57.444
<v Speaker 1>in when you're organizing your </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality in this hierarchical </v>

299
00:20:00.571 --> 00:20:03.450
<v Speaker 1>structure and the process that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>engage in,</v>

300
00:20:03.451 --> 00:20:04.284
<v Speaker 1>well you're updating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It actually manifests itself as </v>

301
00:20:06.781 --> 00:20:09.870
<v Speaker 1>intrinsically meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's.</v>

302
00:20:09.871 --> 00:20:10.704
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an element of your off your </v>

303
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.673
<v Speaker 1>intrinsic being that's actually devoted </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards fostering that process and when </v>

304
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.790
<v Speaker 1>people talk about the idea that life </v>
<v Speaker 1>might have some meaning,</v>

305
00:20:23.791 --> 00:20:24.624
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that you can actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience that meeting when you're </v>

306
00:20:27.631 --> 00:20:28.464
<v Speaker 1>engaged in the process of producing this</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchically organized structure and </v>

307
00:20:31.621 --> 00:20:33.750
<v Speaker 1>balancing and maintaining it across </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

308
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:36.090
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is and idea too,</v>

309
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.193
<v Speaker 1>I think that what you experienced that </v>
<v Speaker 1>as his engagement when you're very much </v>

310
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:44.023
<v Speaker 1>interested in something that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing and you're sunk right into it so </v>

311
00:20:46.651 --> 00:20:47.484
<v Speaker 1>that you're not even self conscious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that time itself isn't ticking away </v>

312
00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:52.750
<v Speaker 1>in a painful manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

313
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:55.930
<v Speaker 1>but something that you're not even </v>
<v Speaker 1>really aware of.</v>

314
00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.793
<v Speaker 1>You're not even aware of time </v>
<v Speaker 1>progressing when you're in that sort of </v>

315
00:20:58.811 --> 00:21:01.360
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then that's a signal from your,</v>

316
00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.910
<v Speaker 1>from your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say from your nervous system,</v>

317
00:21:03.911 --> 00:21:04.744
<v Speaker 1>but from being itself that you're in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>position where all the levels of being </v>

318
00:21:08.831 --> 00:21:12.400
<v Speaker 1>are properly organized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that people experienced that</v>

319
00:21:12.401 --> 00:21:16.300
<v Speaker 1>as a deeply meaningful state of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that that has anything</v>

320
00:21:16.301 --> 00:21:18.340
<v Speaker 1>to do with rationality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

321
00:21:18.341 --> 00:21:19.174
<v Speaker 1>because you can as nature pointed out </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we talked about the </v>

322
00:21:21.491 --> 00:21:22.930
<v Speaker 1>existentialists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

323
00:21:22.931 --> 00:21:27.931
<v Speaker 1>you can make a very strong case that </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a rational perspective that life is</v>

324
00:21:28.991 --> 00:21:30.130
<v Speaker 1>devoid of meaning.</v>

325
00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:30.963
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with that is that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts out with the presupposition that </v>

326
00:21:34.541 --> 00:21:39.130
<v Speaker 1>the rational analysis of the situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>that brings that question to life is the</v>

327
00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:39.964
<v Speaker 1>proper level of analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think there's any evidence </v>

328
00:21:42.341 --> 00:21:44.050
<v Speaker 1>for that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

329
00:21:44.051 --> 00:21:44.884
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that Carl Rogers </v>
<v Speaker 1>continually pointed out in his </v>

330
00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:48.753
<v Speaker 1>phenomenological approach was that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>evaluate how you're progressing through </v>

331
00:21:53.981 --> 00:21:54.814
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cannot only rely on your </v>

332
00:21:56.681 --> 00:21:57.514
<v Speaker 1>rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a mistake because you're an </v>

333
00:21:58.901 --> 00:22:03.760
<v Speaker 1>embodied creature and you're constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>being informed by all sorts of processes</v>

334
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.790
<v Speaker 1>that can't be reduced to straightforward</v>
<v Speaker 1>rationality.</v>

335
00:22:06.791 --> 00:22:07.624
<v Speaker 1>And that it's a mistake to assume that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rational mode of interpretation of </v>

336
00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:13.683
<v Speaker 1>experience from moment to moment is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>one that should actually be super </v>

337
00:22:15.931 --> 00:22:17.640
<v Speaker 1>superordinate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

338
00:22:17.641 --> 00:22:21.370
<v Speaker 1>it's a mistake partly because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>more complicated than your rationality.</v>

339
00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:25.540
<v Speaker 1>And so is existence itself is being </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>

340
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:26.410
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

341
00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:27.243
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for the existentialists and the </v>

342
00:22:28.841 --> 00:22:31.240
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially following heidegger,</v>

343
00:22:31.241 --> 00:22:32.074
<v Speaker 1>the question was the nature of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's the proper question </v>

344
00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:37.203
<v Speaker 1>to pose to yourself when you're trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to assess exactly what constitutes the </v>

345
00:22:40.451 --> 00:22:44.950
<v Speaker 1>human personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when these things to me as part</v>

346
00:22:44.951 --> 00:22:45.784
<v Speaker 1>of the reason that I was so interested </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the existential approach because the </v>

347
00:22:48.131 --> 00:22:48.964
<v Speaker 1>existentialist take the idea one step </v>
<v Speaker 1>further and it's in a very complicated </v>

348
00:22:52.301 --> 00:22:53.134
<v Speaker 1>and sophisticated way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they they make the case that you </v>

349
00:22:57.521 --> 00:23:02.521
<v Speaker 1>have an ethical responsibility to being </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that would be to your being,</v>

350
00:23:02.741 --> 00:23:03.574
<v Speaker 1>but to being a general in the ethical </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities that you have to </v>

351
00:23:06.611 --> 00:23:07.444
<v Speaker 1>confront it straightforwardly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly and the way that the 19th and </v>

352
00:23:12.041 --> 00:23:15.670
<v Speaker 1>20th century existentialists came to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was really twofold.</v>

353
00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:18.250
<v Speaker 1>It was mostly from the negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction,</v>

354
00:23:18.251 --> 00:23:19.084
<v Speaker 1>so people like frank girl and social </v>
<v Speaker 1>units and when they were pushing the </v>

355
00:23:22.361 --> 00:23:25.930
<v Speaker 1>idea that it was necessary to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>truthful relationship with being.</v>

356
00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:26.763
<v Speaker 1>The reason they came up with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusion was by observing those </v>

357
00:23:29.891 --> 00:23:33.580
<v Speaker 1>circumstances where people clearly did </v>
<v Speaker 1>not do that.</v>

358
00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:36.130
<v Speaker 1>And so for Frankel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was basically.</v>

359
00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:37.893
<v Speaker 1>That was basically his observations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened in Nazi Germany and for </v>

360
00:23:41.531 --> 00:23:44.380
<v Speaker 1>soldier an incident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was his observations of what happened</v>

361
00:23:44.381 --> 00:23:45.214
<v Speaker 1>in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In establishing the Soviet Union and in </v>

362
00:23:47.391 --> 00:23:48.224
<v Speaker 1>other places that were directly </v>
<v Speaker 1>committed to a comprehensive </v>

363
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.903
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian view of reality and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>observations were that as soon as that </v>

364
00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:58.693
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian viewpoint was imposed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone acted as if every problem had </v>

365
00:24:04.761 --> 00:24:05.594
<v Speaker 1>been finally solved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the immediate consequence of that was </v>

366
00:24:07.791 --> 00:24:08.624
<v Speaker 1>that everyone had to lie about </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything they did in order to support </v>

367
00:24:12.111 --> 00:24:14.480
<v Speaker 1>the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the next consequence of that was the</v>

368
00:24:14.481 --> 00:24:15.314
<v Speaker 1>system became radically genocidal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>murderous and so for Franklin soldier </v>

369
00:24:19.971 --> 00:24:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Nitsa and their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their.</v>

370
00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Their diagnosis of that was that it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary for individual people to adopt</v>

371
00:24:27.321 --> 00:24:28.154
<v Speaker 1>a truthful relationship with being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the consequence of not doing </v>

372
00:24:31.911 --> 00:24:32.744
<v Speaker 1>that was the degeneration of everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>into something that basically resembled </v>

373
00:24:35.571 --> 00:24:36.404
<v Speaker 1>hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can align that idea with the </v>

374
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:40.783
<v Speaker 1>Piagetian idea of the game like </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and you can say something </v>

375
00:24:44.031 --> 00:24:48.180
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is also drawing on the idea,</v>

376
00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:53.190
<v Speaker 1>say of Rogers and the ideas of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of he described it as authentic being is</v>

377
00:24:53.211 --> 00:24:54.044
<v Speaker 1>that the pathway to the appropriate </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical organization of the </v>

378
00:24:57.621 --> 00:25:02.060
<v Speaker 1>personality from the microcosm up to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>macrocosm is actually</v>

379
00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:05.710
<v Speaker 1>fostered by your relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

380
00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:08.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for for Rogers,</v>

381
00:25:08.321 --> 00:25:09.154
<v Speaker 1>he talked about the physiological </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychophysiological manifestations of </v>

382
00:25:12.161 --> 00:25:17.050
<v Speaker 1>that for rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was partly the willingness to</v>

383
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:18.663
<v Speaker 1>enter into a dialogue with your physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>being which which is also a notion that </v>

384
00:25:22.781 --> 00:25:23.614
<v Speaker 1>the psychoanalysts push in a slightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>different direction because people like </v>

385
00:25:27.221 --> 00:25:28.054
<v Speaker 1>Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of the fact that his notion </v>

386
00:25:30.971 --> 00:25:33.300
<v Speaker 1>of what constitutes socialization was </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

387
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:34.343
<v Speaker 1>was to predicated on conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that fried certainly </v>

388
00:25:37.541 --> 00:25:38.374
<v Speaker 1>continually pointed out was that it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary for you to bring all of the </v>

389
00:25:42.101 --> 00:25:46.600
<v Speaker 1>diverse elements of your personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>into into the game,</v>

390
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:48.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you work to repress things?</v>

391
00:25:48.521 --> 00:25:51.070
<v Speaker 1>You weren't to forget things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You weren't supposed to leave.</v>

392
00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:52.083
<v Speaker 1>Elements of your being that were that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were troublesome and difficult to </v>

393
00:25:55.601 --> 00:25:56.434
<v Speaker 1>integrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You weren't supposed to leave those </v>

394
00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:01.930
<v Speaker 1>lying out where nothing could be done </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them and because the consequence of</v>

395
00:26:01.931 --> 00:26:06.931
<v Speaker 1>that would be that those</v>
<v Speaker 1>dissociated parts of you would become</v>

396
00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:15.700
<v Speaker 1>would become pathological and dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they would pose a threat to you,</v>

397
00:26:17.201 --> 00:26:19.990
<v Speaker 1>but also because if you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporate</v>

398
00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:21.903
<v Speaker 1>those cast off elements of being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your personality would be too weak </v>

399
00:26:24.641 --> 00:26:26.890
<v Speaker 1>to prevail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Freud,</v>

400
00:26:26.891 --> 00:26:30.430
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those that the probability was very high</v>

401
00:26:30.431 --> 00:26:31.264
<v Speaker 1>that the cast off elements of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be those that were associated </v>

402
00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:34.653
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally with aggression and with </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality because you might think that </v>

403
00:26:37.511 --> 00:26:38.344
<v Speaker 1>those are the two most dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational forces that people have at </v>

404
00:26:42.551 --> 00:26:43.384
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know you're a pretty hollow in </v>

405
00:26:45.001 --> 00:26:47.610
<v Speaker 1>thin person if you're not capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression,</v>

406
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:52.880
<v Speaker 1>and if your sexual morality is </v>
<v Speaker 1>continually as as only predicated on,</v>

407
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.353
<v Speaker 1>well your inability to engage in sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity because no one wants you or </v>

408
00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:02.820
<v Speaker 1>because you're repressing it and very </v>
<v Speaker 1>awkward and unskilled out.</v>

409
00:27:02.821 --> 00:27:05.400
<v Speaker 1>It's in so that the question never even </v>
<v Speaker 1>arises.</v>

410
00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:07.230
<v Speaker 1>You know that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the.</v>

411
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:08.303
<v Speaker 1>That's the approach people take when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they try to make their children's so </v>

412
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:12.563
<v Speaker 1>naive about sexuality and so protected </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're terrified to have anything </v>

413
00:27:16.081 --> 00:27:19.260
<v Speaker 1>to do with it whatsoever and that might </v>
<v Speaker 1>work very well.</v>

414
00:27:19.261 --> 00:27:22.590
<v Speaker 1>As long as they're in a situation where </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are so</v>

415
00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.753
<v Speaker 1>underdeveloped and repressed that no one</v>
<v Speaker 1>has wants to have anything to do with </v>

416
00:27:28.701 --> 00:27:29.534
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as they get out into the </v>

417
00:27:30.261 --> 00:27:32.990
<v Speaker 1>world where sexual behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

418
00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:33.843
<v Speaker 1>starts to become a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that does is leave them completely </v>

419
00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:38.053
<v Speaker 1>open to their own pathologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the predatory behavior of other </v>

420
00:27:41.091 --> 00:27:43.520
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not much of a solution.</v>

421
00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:45.863
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

422
00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:47.713
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the existentialist idea and that's the </v>

423
00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.473
<v Speaker 1>idea of authentic being is that the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate way to interact with being </v>

424
00:27:57.651 --> 00:28:02.651
<v Speaker 1>as an emergency is is by maintaining </v>
<v Speaker 1>some relationship with truth.</v>

425
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.943
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a very difficult concept to to </v>
<v Speaker 1>really come to grips with because it's </v>

426
00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.150
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as as is famously known.</v>

427
00:28:11.151 --> 00:28:15.470
<v Speaker 1>It's not that easy to identify exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes truth.</v>

428
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:18.890
<v Speaker 1>I think that's part of the reason why </v>
<v Speaker 1>Franklin Solzhenitsyn,</v>

429
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:22.190
<v Speaker 1>when they were talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>existential approach to being.</v>

430
00:28:22.191 --> 00:28:23.024
<v Speaker 1>We're more likely to concentrate on </v>
<v Speaker 1>false hood rather than on truth per se </v>

431
00:28:26.691 --> 00:28:29.780
<v Speaker 1>because I think it's easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think about this yourself,</v>

432
00:28:29.781 --> 00:28:30.614
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's easier for each of us </v>
<v Speaker 1>to identify when we're doing something </v>

433
00:28:34.371 --> 00:28:35.204
<v Speaker 1>wrong than it is for us to determine </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not we happen to be on the </v>

434
00:28:39.051 --> 00:28:44.051
<v Speaker 1>right path because the the issue of </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether right now you're doing something</v>

435
00:28:44.901 --> 00:28:46.940
<v Speaker 1>wrong is simpler in some sense.</v>

436
00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:47.863
<v Speaker 1>Then the question then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then trying to understand whether the </v>

437
00:28:50.781 --> 00:28:51.614
<v Speaker 1>sum total of all your actions right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>are those that will put you into the </v>

438
00:28:54.861 --> 00:28:55.694
<v Speaker 1>appropriate place into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that as you establish a </v>

439
00:28:58.671 --> 00:29:02.090
<v Speaker 1>relationship with truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that you try to do is to</v>

440
00:29:02.091 --> 00:29:02.924
<v Speaker 1>start lying and that's not exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing as telling the truth because </v>

441
00:29:06.921 --> 00:29:10.730
<v Speaker 1>I would say you can't actually tell the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth because you don't know what it is,</v>

442
00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:15.480
<v Speaker 1>but you can certainly strive not to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk,</v>

443
00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:19.430
<v Speaker 1>not to speak or act in ways that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know to be false.</v>

444
00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:23.540
<v Speaker 1>And I think that by doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of how you,</v>

445
00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:24.793
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you integrate your personality and you </v>

446
00:29:26.931 --> 00:29:27.764
<v Speaker 1>strengthen your personality across time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and also how you learn to understand </v>

447
00:29:31.881 --> 00:29:36.550
<v Speaker 1>larger and larger sections of what might</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually be true rather than what</v>

448
00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:37.513
<v Speaker 3>that</v>

449
00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:43.150
<v Speaker 1>instead of only being able to identify </v>
<v Speaker 1>from moment to moment what's false.</v>

450
00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:47.790
<v Speaker 1>No one character guard would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

451
00:29:47.791 --> 00:29:48.624
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an element of faith in a </v>

452
00:29:50.131 --> 00:29:50.964
<v Speaker 1>decision like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell you a little bit about </v>

453
00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:53.993
<v Speaker 1>what he meant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we know when we were talking about </v>

454
00:29:55.681 --> 00:29:56.514
<v Speaker 1>Carl Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about instrumental use of </v>

455
00:29:58.171 --> 00:29:59.040
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

456
00:29:59.041 --> 00:29:59.874
<v Speaker 1>So the idea there would be that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>using language constantly to get what I </v>

457
00:30:04.411 --> 00:30:07.080
<v Speaker 1>want from the world in any given </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

458
00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:08.343
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that instrumental use is predicated on </v>

459
00:30:09.961 --> 00:30:14.220
<v Speaker 1>the idea that I know what I want and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I know what's good for me.</v>

460
00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:16.230
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that's a very,</v>

461
00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:17.803
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very unlikely that that's true </v>

462
00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:25.200
<v Speaker 1>because you don't know what's good for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you in the final analysis because you're</v>

463
00:30:25.201 --> 00:30:26.034
<v Speaker 1>too ignorant to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're using language to </v>

464
00:30:28.501 --> 00:30:33.090
<v Speaker 1>manipulate the world to ensure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>things turn out the way you want them to</v>

465
00:30:33.091 --> 00:30:33.924
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're acting as if your knowledge </v>

466
00:30:37.351 --> 00:30:41.250
<v Speaker 1>about what constitutes the good is </v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently well developed and final so</v>

467
00:30:41.251 --> 00:30:44.880
<v Speaker 1>that you can rely on it as a guide to </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're going to say and do.</v>

468
00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:47.520
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alternative to that is something.</v>

469
00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:51.030
<v Speaker 1>There is an alternative to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a very complicated alternative.</v>

470
00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:54.630
<v Speaker 1>And the alternative to that is something</v>
<v Speaker 1>more like,</v>

471
00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:00.080
<v Speaker 1>it has more to do with reliance on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity to transform.</v>

472
00:31:00.081 --> 00:31:00.914
<v Speaker 1>Because here's an alternative to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of rigid and manipulative approach </v>

473
00:31:04.851 --> 00:31:08.630
<v Speaker 1>to life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the alternative is to try to act out</v>

474
00:31:08.631 --> 00:31:13.631
<v Speaker 1>what you think is appropriate and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>save what you think is true as carefully</v>

475
00:31:13.941 --> 00:31:17.330
<v Speaker 1>as you possibly can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then to see what happens</v>

476
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:22.290
<v Speaker 1>and that's a completely different way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>approaching the situation and it's a lot</v>

477
00:31:22.291 --> 00:31:24.550
<v Speaker 1>more interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

478
00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:25.453
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I've been thinking </v>

479
00:31:26.851 --> 00:31:27.684
<v Speaker 1>about is I truly believe that the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that people speak potential into </v>

480
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:35.543
<v Speaker 1>being is accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that what we face as we move </v>

481
00:31:38.611 --> 00:31:39.444
<v Speaker 1>through life is a realm of potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's in front of us that we can </v>

482
00:31:42.361 --> 00:31:46.740
<v Speaker 1>continually interact with and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's actually helped people think</v>

483
00:31:46.741 --> 00:31:48.510
<v Speaker 1>about the world when they think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

484
00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:49.673
<v Speaker 1>because we think of the future as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>place of diverse possibilities and we </v>

485
00:31:53.191 --> 00:31:54.024
<v Speaker 1>think of the future as something we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>maneuver through and turning into </v>

486
00:31:57.571 --> 00:31:59.630
<v Speaker 1>actuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

487
00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:00.573
<v Speaker 1>That's what we think about when we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we think about potential and and </v>

488
00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.313
<v Speaker 1>about realizing the potential in things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the potential in ourselves and the </v>

489
00:32:07.531 --> 00:32:10.470
<v Speaker 1>potential in other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then you ask yourself,</v>

490
00:32:10.471 --> 00:32:12.510
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think?</v>

491
00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.553
<v Speaker 1>What's the best technology that you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>at your disposal for transforming </v>

492
00:32:19.411 --> 00:32:20.244
<v Speaker 1>potential into the kind of actuality </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you would actually want to see </v>

493
00:32:22.951 --> 00:32:24.780
<v Speaker 1>around you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might ask yourself,</v>

494
00:32:24.781 --> 00:32:25.614
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it more likely that you're going to </v>

495
00:32:27.301 --> 00:32:28.134
<v Speaker 1>get the actuality that you want by </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to trying to grapple with </v>

496
00:32:33.031 --> 00:32:33.864
<v Speaker 1>potential in a truthful manner?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is it more likely that you're going </v>

497
00:32:37.111 --> 00:32:39.060
<v Speaker 1>to get the kind of actuality that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want?</v>

498
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:40.003
<v Speaker 1>You grappled with reality in a manner </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's rife with falsehood and I would </v>

499
00:32:43.761 --> 00:32:45.830
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if,</v>

500
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:49.580
<v Speaker 1>if framing potential into actuality is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like building a house,</v>

501
00:32:49.581 --> 00:32:52.550
<v Speaker 1>then I would say if you build a house </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the proper materials,</v>

502
00:32:52.551 --> 00:32:55.370
<v Speaker 1>then it might stand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you build a house out of cap rate</v>

503
00:32:55.371 --> 00:32:56.204
<v Speaker 1>materials and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take shortcuts wherever you can and </v>

504
00:32:58.911 --> 00:33:01.910
<v Speaker 1>you pretend things are other than what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>

505
00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Then as soon as the ground shakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your house is going to fall.</v>

506
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:09.170
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to me to be something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fundamentally undeniable.</v>

507
00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.353
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you mix too much sand in your </v>

508
00:33:11.541 --> 00:33:12.374
<v Speaker 1>Samantha and your foundation is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be weak and you can do that merely by </v>

509
00:33:16.701 --> 00:33:17.534
<v Speaker 1>ignoring what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I think that the root out of </v>

510
00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:25.580
<v Speaker 1>inauthentic being in the root out of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>proclivity to identify with,</v>

511
00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:26.893
<v Speaker 1>with ultimately genocidal ideologies is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to attempt to establish a relationship </v>

512
00:33:32.031 --> 00:33:35.990
<v Speaker 1>with being that's predicated on at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>not on falsehood,</v>

513
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:40.460
<v Speaker 1>at least that you know in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things Rogers would say,</v>

514
00:33:40.461 --> 00:33:41.294
<v Speaker 1>and I think he's right about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you consult the totality of </v>

515
00:33:45.051 --> 00:33:47.450
<v Speaker 1>your being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're acting and you're speaking,</v>

516
00:33:47.451 --> 00:33:48.284
<v Speaker 1>you can tell by paying attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that you're responding to your </v>

517
00:33:52.521 --> 00:33:53.690
<v Speaker 1>actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enter your.</v>

518
00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:54.733
<v Speaker 1>Enter your words whether or not what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing and saying is pulling you </v>

519
00:33:57.921 --> 00:33:58.754
<v Speaker 1>together and making you integrate it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>making you strong or whether it's </v>

520
00:34:01.791 --> 00:34:06.791
<v Speaker 1>pulling you apart and disintegrate you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and making you weak and roll.</v>

521
00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:07.803
<v Speaker 1>One of Roger's claims was that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a psychophysiological </v>

522
00:34:10.491 --> 00:34:12.230
<v Speaker 1>sensations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He called that.</v>

523
00:34:12.231 --> 00:34:13.064
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he described that in association with </v>

524
00:34:14.181 --> 00:34:17.390
<v Speaker 1>the wisdom of the body and are you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really believe that to be true?</v>

525
00:34:17.391 --> 00:34:18.224
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see this when I'm talking to </v>

526
00:34:19.671 --> 00:34:23.480
<v Speaker 1>people when I'm talking to my clients or</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm talking to other people,</v>

527
00:34:23.481 --> 00:34:27.890
<v Speaker 1>I can see as soon as they start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>misuse their words are start to use them</v>

528
00:34:27.891 --> 00:34:28.724
<v Speaker 1>in an instrumental manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the strength goes out of them </v>

529
00:34:30.951 --> 00:34:31.784
<v Speaker 1>completely and you can detect that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something shallow and false </v>

530
00:34:35.301 --> 00:34:36.134
<v Speaker 1>going on and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you call people's attention to that </v>

531
00:34:38.901 --> 00:34:39.734
<v Speaker 1>fact when it's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're often rather resistant to </v>

532
00:34:41.901 --> 00:34:42.734
<v Speaker 1>noticing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if they do open their eyes and pay </v>

533
00:34:44.961 --> 00:34:45.794
<v Speaker 1>attention to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can see right away that that's </v>

534
00:34:47.601 --> 00:34:48.434
<v Speaker 1>what's occurring</v>

535
00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.340
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we moved into it,</v>

536
00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:01.730
<v Speaker 1>when we move towards Freud in Yom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

537
00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:02.623
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was extremely interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>young and I have been extremely </v>

538
00:35:05.091 --> 00:35:05.924
<v Speaker 1>interested in young because he's one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the few things that I've ever </v>

539
00:35:08.061 --> 00:35:08.894
<v Speaker 1>encountered who takes culture seriously </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he believes that it's necessary </v>

540
00:35:14.361 --> 00:35:17.000
<v Speaker 1>because we're historical creatures and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're.</v>

541
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:18.223
<v Speaker 1>We're shaped by historical facts that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's necessary for us to understand our </v>

542
00:35:22.071 --> 00:35:22.904
<v Speaker 1>culture and our past because we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>embodying it because we're historically </v>

543
00:35:26.661 --> 00:35:27.494
<v Speaker 1>constructed creatures and so the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>to study history is because history is </v>

544
00:35:30.771 --> 00:35:31.604
<v Speaker 1>you and if you don't understand history </v>
<v Speaker 1>than history is gonna have it's gonna </v>

545
00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:36.123
<v Speaker 1>have you in its clutches and it's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be moving you from place to place </v>

546
00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:41.940
<v Speaker 1>because it was young who formulated the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>

547
00:35:41.941 --> 00:35:44.760
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people don't have ideas.</v>

548
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:49.860
<v Speaker 1>That ideas have people and I think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take that notion seriously,</v>

549
00:35:49.861 --> 00:35:52.370
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the most frightening things </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can ever realized.</v>

550
00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:56.610
<v Speaker 1>Because of course everyone thinks that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have ideas.</v>

551
00:35:56.611 --> 00:35:58.470
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

552
00:35:58.471 --> 00:35:59.304
<v Speaker 1>who are possessed by an ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously the idea has them because you </v>

553
00:36:03.781 --> 00:36:06.360
<v Speaker 1>can predict exactly what they're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say and do.</v>

554
00:36:06.361 --> 00:36:07.194
<v Speaker 1>In every situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can predict exactly what solution </v>

555
00:36:10.141 --> 00:36:10.974
<v Speaker 1>they're going to bring to the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you discuss any problem and if </v>

556
00:36:14.941 --> 00:36:15.774
<v Speaker 1>you come up with an idea about a problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you come up with an idea about the </v>

557
00:36:19.111 --> 00:36:19.944
<v Speaker 1>problem and it's the same idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that it's you coming up </v>

558
00:36:23.311 --> 00:36:25.440
<v Speaker 1>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you coming up with it is zero.</v>

559
00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:26.633
<v Speaker 1>It's whatever it is that's coming up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the same idea is the thing that's </v>

560
00:36:29.731 --> 00:36:30.564
<v Speaker 1>got control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you see this with people </v>

561
00:36:32.731 --> 00:36:35.340
<v Speaker 1>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they arbitrarily divide the world,</v>

562
00:36:35.341 --> 00:36:36.174
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>up into those things that are good and </v>

563
00:36:38.101 --> 00:36:39.870
<v Speaker 1>acceptable in those things that aren't.</v>

564
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:41.063
<v Speaker 1>You see this with right wingers and use </v>
<v Speaker 1>it with left-wingers because the right </v>

565
00:36:43.501 --> 00:36:44.334
<v Speaker 1>wingers make the claim that government </v>
<v Speaker 1>is evil and the left wing makes the </v>

566
00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:51.150
<v Speaker 1>claim that corporations are evil and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you take five left wingers,</v>

567
00:36:51.151 --> 00:36:54.300
<v Speaker 1>you can tell exactly what they're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say about any given problem.</v>

568
00:36:54.301 --> 00:36:57.180
<v Speaker 1>And if you take five right wingers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's exactly the same thing.</v>

569
00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:02.130
<v Speaker 1>So then that brings up the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who exactly is doing the talking and the</v>

570
00:37:02.131 --> 00:37:03.810
<v Speaker 1>thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

571
00:37:03.811 --> 00:37:07.380
<v Speaker 1>the people who are spouting those ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that they're doing the thinking,</v>

572
00:37:07.381 --> 00:37:08.214
<v Speaker 1>but there's no reason to assume that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the case at all and I can tell </v>

573
00:37:10.891 --> 00:37:13.290
<v Speaker 1>you something else that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>determine right away.</v>

574
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:17.070
<v Speaker 1>People are dead boring when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>spouting etiological clap trap.</v>

575
00:37:17.071 --> 00:37:17.904
<v Speaker 1>You could hardly even listened to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can take virtually anyone </v>

576
00:37:20.551 --> 00:37:21.384
<v Speaker 1>educated or uneducated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if they start to tell you the truth </v>

577
00:37:23.791 --> 00:37:27.690
<v Speaker 1>about their own experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they do that in a stumbling way,</v>

578
00:37:27.691 --> 00:37:28.524
<v Speaker 1>in a halting way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they become fascinating instantly </v>

579
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:35.220
<v Speaker 1>because they're the only people who have</v>
<v Speaker 1>access to that information and it's rich</v>

580
00:37:35.221 --> 00:37:38.640
<v Speaker 1>and deep information and you know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's personal.</v>

581
00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.270
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

582
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:40.103
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

583
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:43.800
<v Speaker 1>it's material that they have a right to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

584
00:37:43.801 --> 00:37:44.634
<v Speaker 1>and they can intermingle that with ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the culture has produced even in </v>

585
00:37:48.001 --> 00:37:48.834
<v Speaker 1>theological ideas and come up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's richer and more </v>

586
00:37:52.231 --> 00:37:53.064
<v Speaker 1>brilliant as a consequence of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if they're not speaking their own </v>

587
00:37:55.801 --> 00:37:56.850
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

588
00:37:56.851 --> 00:37:57.684
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something else that's speaking </v>

589
00:37:59.251 --> 00:38:00.420
<v Speaker 1>through them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And second,</v>

590
00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.370
<v Speaker 1>there's something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dead.</v>

591
00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:07.880
<v Speaker 1>So I don't remember if I told you the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the origin of the word slogan,</v>

592
00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:14.430
<v Speaker 1>so slogan comes from to Welsh words and </v>
<v Speaker 1>one is slew egg,</v>

593
00:38:14.431 --> 00:38:15.950
<v Speaker 1>which is Slu a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>g,</v>

594
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.210
<v Speaker 1>H,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other is Gary,</v>

595
00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:19.890
<v Speaker 1>g,</v>
<v Speaker 1>h a I r m.</v>

596
00:38:19.891 --> 00:38:24.870
<v Speaker 1>So it's slew a Garren.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Garren means gerome means the battle cry</v>

597
00:38:24.871 --> 00:38:29.640
<v Speaker 1>of the data and that to me is a perfect </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

598
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:30.503
<v Speaker 1>Often it's a perfectly example of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating the process by which he </v>

599
00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:38.470
<v Speaker 1>words emerge actually is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a dead accurate</v>

600
00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.193
<v Speaker 1>description of what's speaking through a</v>
<v Speaker 1>person when their languages being </v>

601
00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:46.623
<v Speaker 1>reduced to slogan and they're not paying</v>
<v Speaker 1>any attention to their own </v>

602
00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:51.723
<v Speaker 1>individualized being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what it is is that it's the army of </v>

603
00:38:55.151 --> 00:38:57.400
<v Speaker 1>the dead in some sense speaking through </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

604
00:38:57.610 --> 00:39:01.180
<v Speaker 1>There's no spirit there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing that's alive.</v>

605
00:39:01.181 --> 00:39:02.014
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that being possessed </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the army of the dead is a very good </v>

606
00:39:06.161 --> 00:39:07.870
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

607
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:10.983
<v Speaker 1>that's all wisdom that was useful for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the past and that's lost its ability to </v>

608
00:39:14.201 --> 00:39:15.670
<v Speaker 1>be applicable to the president.</v>

609
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:18.833
<v Speaker 1>One of the other things that seems to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happen to people in university is </v>

610
00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:25.560
<v Speaker 1>they don't really get educated about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>important what they do actually is,</v>

611
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.823
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that goes along with the </v>

612
00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:32.670
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic cast of modern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of modern people.</v>

613
00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:35.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to view yourself as one little</v>

614
00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:39.400
<v Speaker 1>dust mote floating around in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

615
00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:42.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a stadium full of dust motes and air.</v>

616
00:39:42.301 --> 00:39:43.134
<v Speaker 1>So you're all disconnected with each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other and none of you have any causal </v>

617
00:39:45.931 --> 00:39:46.764
<v Speaker 1>impact on anyone else around the hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think there's any reason to </v>

618
00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:54.420
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize yourself using that model </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

619
00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:55.283
<v Speaker 1>Because the first thing that is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>easy to notice is that you're very much </v>

620
00:39:58.291 --> 00:39:59.850
<v Speaker 1>networked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

621
00:39:59.851 --> 00:40:00.684
<v Speaker 1>And so over the course of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have direct and </v>

622
00:40:03.451 --> 00:40:06.660
<v Speaker 1>relatively profound influence on several</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand people.</v>

623
00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:09.270
<v Speaker 1>And some of you may be more and some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you less,</v>

624
00:40:09.271 --> 00:40:11.940
<v Speaker 1>but we could certainly say a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

625
00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:13.283
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in each of those thousand people will </v>

626
00:40:14.171 --> 00:40:15.150
<v Speaker 1>know a thousand people.</v>

627
00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:18.000
<v Speaker 1>And that's a million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one step past that is a billion.</v>

628
00:40:18.001 --> 00:40:18.834
<v Speaker 1>And so you basically sit in the center </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a network that with very limited </v>

629
00:40:23.251 --> 00:40:25.980
<v Speaker 1>extension covers virtually everyone on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the planet,</v>

630
00:40:25.981 --> 00:40:26.814
<v Speaker 1>and that's becoming more and more true </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than less and less true as </v>

631
00:40:29.881 --> 00:40:33.000
<v Speaker 1>everyone becomes increasingly networked </v>
<v Speaker 1>and connected.</v>

632
00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:34.313
<v Speaker 1>And so what that implies is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you do that you choose to </v>

633
00:40:37.081 --> 00:40:38.970
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the things that you choose not to do,</v>

634
00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.073
<v Speaker 1>are going to have effects that ripple </v>
<v Speaker 1>far beyond your particular individual </v>

635
00:40:44.281 --> 00:40:45.114
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so part of what that means is that </v>

636
00:40:47.251 --> 00:40:48.084
<v Speaker 1>all of the choices that you make as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're confronting that unstructured </v>

637
00:40:51.241 --> 00:40:52.074
<v Speaker 1>future as you move through your life are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to alter the structure of being </v>

638
00:40:55.051 --> 00:40:57.060
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

639
00:40:57.061 --> 00:41:01.890
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've showed you guys repeatedly,</v>

640
00:41:01.891 --> 00:41:02.724
<v Speaker 1>that hierarchy of action right there </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a highest resolution level being </v>

641
00:41:06.811 --> 00:41:09.210
<v Speaker 1>the things that you actually do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body,</v>

642
00:41:09.211 --> 00:41:11.940
<v Speaker 1>the muscle movements that you manifest </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world and,</v>

643
00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:16.170
<v Speaker 1>and showed you how those are </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchically organized into higher and</v>

644
00:41:16.171 --> 00:41:18.150
<v Speaker 1>higher systems of value.</v>

645
00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:21.420
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I showed you that hierarchy,</v>

646
00:41:21.421 --> 00:41:24.420
<v Speaker 1>the thing I put at the top was be a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

647
00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:25.913
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that can be elaborated out </v>

648
00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:30.443
<v Speaker 1>in a reasonable manner so that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible to understand more and more </v>

649
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:34.123
<v Speaker 1>being a good person is about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of it is that you have to have </v>

650
00:41:37.641 --> 00:41:38.474
<v Speaker 1>organized yourself into something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>well structured and useful and I think </v>

651
00:41:41.751 --> 00:41:42.584
<v Speaker 1>you do that by disciplining yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>by adopting some role in the world </v>

652
00:41:46.971 --> 00:41:51.971
<v Speaker 1>that's that's meaningful and profound so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have to so that the so that the</v>

653
00:41:53.961 --> 00:41:54.794
<v Speaker 1>stress and demands of of that organized </v>
<v Speaker 1>you into something that's that's strong </v>

654
00:42:00.411 --> 00:42:03.680
<v Speaker 1>and flexible and productive and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one element of it.</v>

655
00:42:03.681 --> 00:42:04.514
<v Speaker 1>I think of that as a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>apprenticeship element and I think I </v>

656
00:42:06.951 --> 00:42:10.730
<v Speaker 1>learned that mostly from nature because </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of nature's claims was that in order</v>

657
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.760
<v Speaker 1>to become properly developed as a human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

658
00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:15.410
<v Speaker 1>you had to undergo a position.</v>

659
00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:16.303
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had to undergo a process of </v>

660
00:42:19.131 --> 00:42:21.350
<v Speaker 1>voluntary slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some sense.</v>

661
00:42:21.351 --> 00:42:22.184
<v Speaker 1>You had to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had to give yourself over to some </v>

662
00:42:25.641 --> 00:42:28.790
<v Speaker 1>sort of role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps it doesn't even matter what role</v>

663
00:42:28.791 --> 00:42:29.624
<v Speaker 1>so that you became an expert at that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was going to cost you in that </v>

664
00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:35.420
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be bent and twisted into</v>
<v Speaker 1>that role,</v>

665
00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:36.523
<v Speaker 1>but it's also going to discipline and </v>
<v Speaker 1>organize you and the alternative is to </v>

666
00:42:39.861 --> 00:42:43.610
<v Speaker 1>become nothing you know and that's not a</v>
<v Speaker 1>useful alternative.</v>

667
00:42:43.611 --> 00:42:46.730
<v Speaker 1>So you want to become something and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you become something,</v>

668
00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:50.240
<v Speaker 1>well then you want to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>transform that something into,</v>

669
00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:53.420
<v Speaker 1>into whatever is necessary at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular point.</v>

670
00:42:53.421 --> 00:42:54.254
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's where the ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are associated with heroin </v>

671
00:42:57.321 --> 00:42:58.154
<v Speaker 1>mythology start to become particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant to considerations of higher </v>

672
00:43:02.151 --> 00:43:03.980
<v Speaker 1>order ethics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the hero,</v>

673
00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:09.980
<v Speaker 1>the hero in mythology is the hero in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythology,</v>

674
00:43:09.981 --> 00:43:14.981
<v Speaker 1>is the representation of the human being</v>
<v Speaker 1>in so far as mankind understands what it</v>

675
00:43:15.291 --> 00:43:16.124
<v Speaker 1>is to be human and what the hero does is</v>
<v Speaker 1>confront the things that he or she does </v>

676
00:43:20.091 --> 00:43:20.924
<v Speaker 1>not understand and take what's valuable </v>
<v Speaker 1>from that confrontation and then </v>

677
00:43:25.131 --> 00:43:28.370
<v Speaker 1>reintegrated into the personality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the society.</v>

678
00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:29.203
<v Speaker 1>That's why the hero goes out to where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dragon is and takes the gold and </v>

679
00:43:32.601 --> 00:43:36.020
<v Speaker 1>then brings the gold back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>community and distributes it,</v>

680
00:43:36.021 --> 00:43:37.970
<v Speaker 1>and so I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

681
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:42.470
<v Speaker 1>part of being a good person is being </v>
<v Speaker 1>good for something and then another part</v>

682
00:43:42.471 --> 00:43:43.304
<v Speaker 1>of being a good person is being better </v>
<v Speaker 1>than being good for something because </v>

683
00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:48.140
<v Speaker 1>you want to be not only good for </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

684
00:43:48.141 --> 00:43:51.650
<v Speaker 1>but you want to be able to be good for </v>
<v Speaker 1>something in a way that keeps making you</v>

685
00:43:51.651 --> 00:43:53.780
<v Speaker 1>better and better at being good for </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

686
00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:56.180
<v Speaker 1>And that means you can't just be </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

687
00:43:56.181 --> 00:43:58.730
<v Speaker 1>It means that you have to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>something constantly.</v>

688
00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:00.193
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that the tremendous amount </v>

689
00:44:02.721 --> 00:44:03.554
<v Speaker 1>of what constitutes the intrinsic </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning of life can be found in that </v>

690
00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:10.610
<v Speaker 1>attempt to continually expand and </v>
<v Speaker 1>reorganize as you're expanding.</v>

691
00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:13.970
<v Speaker 1>Because this is a union idea.</v>

692
00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:14.803
<v Speaker 1>I mean human beings are cognitively </v>
<v Speaker 1>dynamic creatures and we find intrinsic </v>

693
00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:24.500
<v Speaker 1>worth in participating in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitively dynamic process.</v>

694
00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:27.110
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I think outside of that,</v>

695
00:44:27.111 --> 00:44:28.910
<v Speaker 1>there's another question which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

696
00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:32.100
<v Speaker 1>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it exactly you're aiming at?</v>

697
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:36.540
<v Speaker 1>And My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my experience has taught me,</v>

698
00:44:36.541 --> 00:44:37.374
<v Speaker 1>and this is partly a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>studying archetypes for a very long </v>

699
00:44:40.531 --> 00:44:41.364
<v Speaker 1>period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the fundamental question that's </v>

700
00:44:44.281 --> 00:44:45.114
<v Speaker 1>on the very outer reaches of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy that's associated with ethics </v>

701
00:44:48.961 --> 00:44:49.794
<v Speaker 1>and morality is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you trying to make the world a </v>

702
00:44:51.361 --> 00:44:55.440
<v Speaker 1>better place or a worse place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I believe that every time you make a</v>

703
00:44:55.441 --> 00:44:58.380
<v Speaker 1>decision when you could go one way or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could go another,</v>

704
00:44:58.381 --> 00:44:59.214
<v Speaker 1>that in some sense you're acting out </v>
<v Speaker 1>your conviction in relationship to that </v>

705
00:45:03.271 --> 00:45:06.120
<v Speaker 1>highest order question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one you say,</v>

706
00:45:06.121 --> 00:45:06.954
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would people really work to make the </v>

707
00:45:08.071 --> 00:45:10.740
<v Speaker 1>world a worse place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>

708
00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:12.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have to ask that question,</v>

709
00:45:12.391 --> 00:45:15.180
<v Speaker 1>then you should open your eyes because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we know the answer to that.</v>

710
00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:19.860
<v Speaker 1>The old 20th century was full of have </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades and decades.</v>

711
00:45:19.861 --> 00:45:21.000
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the primary,</v>

712
00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:24.420
<v Speaker 1>I think the primary,</v>

713
00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:28.573
<v Speaker 1>the most important information that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can derive from an analysis of the 20th </v>

714
00:45:31.431 --> 00:45:32.264
<v Speaker 1>centuries that is pretty damn certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people are willing to work to make </v>

715
00:45:34.881 --> 00:45:36.980
<v Speaker 1>everything as terrible as they possibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

716
00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:42.140
<v Speaker 1>And that's definitely worth considering </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if people are willing to do that</v>

717
00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:43.093
<v Speaker 1>and motivated to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that probably means that you're willing </v>

718
00:45:45.411 --> 00:45:46.244
<v Speaker 1>to do that motivated to do it too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's fairly easy to </v>

719
00:45:49.101 --> 00:45:49.934
<v Speaker 1>understand why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the reason that people are </v>

720
00:45:51.951 --> 00:45:52.784
<v Speaker 1>motivated to do that sort of thing is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do terrible things is because they're </v>

721
00:45:56.361 --> 00:46:00.230
<v Speaker 1>angry at the conditions of their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're angry at the conditions of being</v>

722
00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:05.500
<v Speaker 1>because being is is composed of </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering and vulnerability and people.</v>

723
00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:07.243
<v Speaker 1>People lose and they suffer and they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful and angry about that and they </v>

724
00:46:10.161 --> 00:46:10.994
<v Speaker 1>feel hard done by and that the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of the world is aimed against </v>

725
00:46:14.481 --> 00:46:15.314
<v Speaker 1>them in some unfair manner and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>get resentful and corrupt and feel that </v>

726
00:46:20.211 --> 00:46:22.100
<v Speaker 1>everything that they do is justifiable.</v>

727
00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:25.820
<v Speaker 1>Given how much torment and suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been living through and from.</v>

728
00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Once you make the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you move into that particular realm</v>

729
00:46:28.911 --> 00:46:29.744
<v Speaker 1>of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your ability to start to make things </v>

730
00:46:32.061 --> 00:46:34.580
<v Speaker 1>worse starts to accelerate </v>
<v Speaker 1>exponentially.</v>

731
00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:35.743
<v Speaker 1>And I don't believe there's a single </v>
<v Speaker 1>person on the planet who hasn't been in </v>

732
00:46:38.061 --> 00:46:38.894
<v Speaker 1>a situation where something has happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>to them that sufficiently disappointing </v>

733
00:46:42.381 --> 00:46:46.460
<v Speaker 1>and tragic so that their thoughts turned</v>
<v Speaker 1>to revenge and destruction.</v>

734
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:50.570
<v Speaker 1>Think that harms to people all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's understandable,</v>

735
00:46:50.571 --> 00:46:51.404
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is it seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily counterproductive and </v>

736
00:46:54.411 --> 00:46:55.244
<v Speaker 1>all it does is make the situation that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's complaining about worse </v>

737
00:46:57.951 --> 00:46:58.784
<v Speaker 1>instead of better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what seems to be the cases that </v>

738
00:47:01.881 --> 00:47:05.300
<v Speaker 1>you have to bear the fact that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>incomplete and,</v>

739
00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:06.493
<v Speaker 1>and I'm vulnerable and underdeveloped in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and weak in many ways without becoming </v>

740
00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:15.610
<v Speaker 1>vengeful and corrupted by your knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that and,</v>

741
00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:18.830
<v Speaker 1>and well still trying to do everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can to make the,</v>

742
00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:21.230
<v Speaker 1>to make being better rather than worse.</v>

743
00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:23.433
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

744
00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:28.660
<v Speaker 1>I think the upside of that mode of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking is I don't believe that there's</v>

745
00:47:28.661 --> 00:47:29.494
<v Speaker 1>anything more engaging and interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>then continued attempts to make things </v>

746
00:47:33.161 --> 00:47:36.280
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A problem is it requires the adoption of</v>

747
00:47:36.281 --> 00:47:38.320
<v Speaker 1>a tremendous amount of responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

748
00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:39.203
<v Speaker 1>And I think that it's the unwillingness </v>
<v Speaker 1>to accept responsibility that stops </v>

749
00:47:43.001 --> 00:47:45.340
<v Speaker 1>people from waking up and becoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightened.</v>

750
00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:47.113
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if if you want to make the world a </v>

751
00:47:48.131 --> 00:47:50.530
<v Speaker 1>better place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to take responsibility for</v>

752
00:47:50.531 --> 00:47:51.364
<v Speaker 1>all of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of the ways that you look at the </v>

753
00:47:52.571 --> 00:47:53.404
<v Speaker 1>world and everything that you act out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the things that you say and it </v>

754
00:47:58.151 --> 00:48:01.090
<v Speaker 1>means you have to pay a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of attention to what you're doing</v>

755
00:48:01.091 --> 00:48:02.500
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

756
00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:03.753
<v Speaker 1>that's very difficult and it's also </v>
<v Speaker 1>frightening because it means that you </v>

757
00:48:06.671 --> 00:48:07.504
<v Speaker 1>have to entertain the hypothesis that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that you're doing are </v>

758
00:48:10.271 --> 00:48:11.104
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

759
00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:12.523
<v Speaker 1>Am I think part of the reason why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why our culture has taken such a </v>

760
00:48:15.761 --> 00:48:16.594
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic Bantus because people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually decided that life would be a </v>

761
00:48:19.691 --> 00:48:21.640
<v Speaker 1>lot easier if it didn't have any </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>

762
00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:23.403
<v Speaker 1>People run around and complain about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that life is meaninglessness or </v>

763
00:48:27.131 --> 00:48:29.850
<v Speaker 1>that life is meaningless and we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

764
00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:30.693
<v Speaker 1>we've drawn that conclusion from both a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rational and empirical perspective and </v>

765
00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:34.563
<v Speaker 1>people will tell you that they came to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that conclusion purely logically and </v>

766
00:48:37.781 --> 00:48:39.880
<v Speaker 1>scientifically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I looked at that claim,</v>

767
00:48:39.881 --> 00:48:40.570
<v Speaker 1>might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

768
00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:43.540
<v Speaker 1>maybe you want life to be beating list </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it lets you off the hook.</v>

769
00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:46.150
<v Speaker 1>If everything you do hasn't gotten any </v>
<v Speaker 1>value,</v>

770
00:48:46.151 --> 00:48:47.980
<v Speaker 1>then why do you have to pay any </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to it?</v>

771
00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:52.030
<v Speaker 1>You can do whatever you want and if it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opposite,</v>

772
00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:54.370
<v Speaker 1>if everything you do has meaning and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important,</v>

773
00:48:54.371 --> 00:48:58.570
<v Speaker 1>well then you better be awake because </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do matters and then you get all</v>

774
00:48:58.571 --> 00:49:00.700
<v Speaker 1>the meaning you want at the price you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to pay for.</v>

775
00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:01.533
<v Speaker 1>That is that you have to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility now and if you start to </v>

776
00:49:04.811 --> 00:49:08.140
<v Speaker 1>seriously entertain the idea that with </v>
<v Speaker 1>every decision you take,</v>

777
00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:11.440
<v Speaker 1>you're tilting the world either towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>heaven or towards hell.</v>

778
00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Then that can instantly start making you</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot more serious about what you choose</v>

779
00:49:16.031 --> 00:49:18.610
<v Speaker 1>to do and not do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And My.</v>

780
00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:19.893
<v Speaker 1>My understanding of personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>development and personality development </v>

781
00:49:22.661 --> 00:49:26.620
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to history is that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is exactly what is the case.</v>

782
00:49:26.621 --> 00:49:28.330
<v Speaker 1>When you're making decisions in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

783
00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:29.523
<v Speaker 1>you face a a field of infinite potential</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you use your will for good or evil </v>

784
00:49:35.021 --> 00:49:37.360
<v Speaker 1>in order to shape it into what it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be.</v>

785
00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:39.153
<v Speaker 1>And that's really what a human being is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A human being is the sort of creature </v>

786
00:49:41.531 --> 00:49:43.960
<v Speaker 1>that can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

787
00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:48.370
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I've found,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's extremely interesting is that there</v>

788
00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:52.660
<v Speaker 1>is an idea at the very core of most </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern legal systems.</v>

789
00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:54.640
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly the case for English </v>
<v Speaker 1>common law,</v>

790
00:49:54.641 --> 00:49:57.970
<v Speaker 1>which I think is the most sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 1>legal system that's ever been developed.</v>

791
00:49:57.971 --> 00:50:02.800
<v Speaker 1>And it's predicated on an idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>every single person has intrinsic worth,</v>

792
00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:04.113
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of the ground of the idea of </v>

793
00:50:05.141 --> 00:50:05.974
<v Speaker 1>natural rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I spend a lot of time looking </v>

794
00:50:08.051 --> 00:50:13.051
<v Speaker 1>into that idea is why is it that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it that the idea that each person</v>

795
00:50:13.481 --> 00:50:14.314
<v Speaker 1>has intrinsic worth ever developed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you look at the </v>

796
00:50:17.111 --> 00:50:19.180
<v Speaker 1>situation and you see that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

797
00:50:19.181 --> 00:50:20.014
<v Speaker 1>some people are clearly doing everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can to make the world as an </v>

798
00:50:23.171 --> 00:50:25.600
<v Speaker 1>absolutely terrible place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

799
00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:26.613
<v Speaker 1>under English common law for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're a serial killer and </v>

800
00:50:29.241 --> 00:50:32.330
<v Speaker 1>everyone knows it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still have rights before the law.</v>

801
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:35.390
<v Speaker 1>And there's an idea there that no matter</v>
<v Speaker 1>how corrupt you've become,</v>

802
00:50:35.391 --> 00:50:38.150
<v Speaker 1>there's still something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>intrinsically valuable about you.</v>

803
00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:39.433
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the modern world claim that </v>

804
00:50:41.871 --> 00:50:43.910
<v Speaker 1>they don't have any metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs.</v>

805
00:50:43.911 --> 00:50:48.911
<v Speaker 1>But in so far as you're an advocate of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the legal system that claims that people</v>

806
00:50:49.521 --> 00:50:50.354
<v Speaker 1>have intrinsic worth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're acting out the idea that </v>

807
00:50:52.641 --> 00:50:57.350
<v Speaker 1>there's something of value about every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single person and then you might ask,</v>

808
00:50:57.351 --> 00:50:58.184
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it that might be a value of </v>

809
00:50:59.661 --> 00:51:04.661
<v Speaker 1>every single person and if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might easily be that it's the faculty</v>

810
00:51:04.761 --> 00:51:07.880
<v Speaker 1>that each person has to turn potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>into actuality.</v>

811
00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:09.153
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that if you do an </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis of the fundamental basis of </v>

812
00:51:13.011 --> 00:51:13.844
<v Speaker 1>modern law then and you and you and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>go down into the understructure of the </v>

813
00:51:19.701 --> 00:51:22.520
<v Speaker 1>ideas that gave rise to that entire body</v>
<v Speaker 1>of law.</v>

814
00:51:22.521 --> 00:51:25.520
<v Speaker 1>What you find is that is the idea at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of it.</v>

815
00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:26.973
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the idea in some sense that </v>

816
00:51:27.891 --> 00:51:28.724
<v Speaker 1>people are made in the image of God and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's God who makes order out of chaos </v>

817
00:51:32.661 --> 00:51:33.494
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes turns chaos into and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes turns order into chaos when </v>

818
00:51:37.311 --> 00:51:40.160
<v Speaker 1>that becomes necessary and people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of doing that.</v>

819
00:51:40.161 --> 00:51:40.994
<v Speaker 1>So I think that we're continually </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in the cocreation of reality </v>

820
00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:48.860
<v Speaker 1>and that we can choose what sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality we want to bring into existence.</v>

821
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.983
<v Speaker 1>So when you can do that in a resentful </v>
<v Speaker 1>and murderous way and you have every </v>

822
00:51:53.631 --> 00:51:54.464
<v Speaker 1>reason to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me to be the wrong </v>

823
00:51:56.511 --> 00:51:59.460
<v Speaker 1>choice and you'll pay a big price for </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>

824
00:51:59.490 --> 00:52:02.060
<v Speaker 1>You pay a big price for doing that every</v>
<v Speaker 1>second of your life.</v>

825
00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:23.500
<v Speaker 1>The things that I've been talking to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>about for the entire course,</v>

826
00:52:23.501 --> 00:52:24.334
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are things that I've tried to put </v>

827
00:52:25.031 --> 00:52:27.760
<v Speaker 1>into practice in one way or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

828
00:52:27.761 --> 00:52:31.420
<v Speaker 1>when I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm engaged in therapy with people,</v>

829
00:52:31.810 --> 00:52:34.960
<v Speaker 1>what I'm really trying to do is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to what they have to say.</v>

830
00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:36.303
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

831
00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:39.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't really want to give them advice </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the advice isn't that helpful.</v>

832
00:52:39.761 --> 00:52:44.290
<v Speaker 1>But usually what we try to do is we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to lay out what the problem is.</v>

833
00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:45.153
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a consequence of mutual </v>

834
00:52:46.811 --> 00:52:50.020
<v Speaker 1>discussion because often people don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really know why they're troubled.</v>

835
00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:51.153
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have some ideas about it and they </v>

836
00:52:52.781 --> 00:52:53.614
<v Speaker 1>can talk about the situation in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>family and the fact that their </v>

837
00:52:55.541 --> 00:52:57.400
<v Speaker 1>relationships aren't going well and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth,</v>

838
00:52:57.401 --> 00:52:58.234
<v Speaker 1>but it's no easy matter to actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>specify the problem because if things </v>

839
00:53:01.301 --> 00:53:02.134
<v Speaker 1>aren't going well for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not necessarily the case that you </v>

840
00:53:04.541 --> 00:53:07.180
<v Speaker 1>know why you might know some of it.</v>

841
00:53:07.810 --> 00:53:10.810
<v Speaker 1>You might even know that there's some </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you're doing that you should</v>

842
00:53:10.811 --> 00:53:13.180
<v Speaker 1>stop doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't stop doing them.</v>

843
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:18.130
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of the initial discussion is </v>
<v Speaker 1>mirrored delineation of what the problem</v>

844
00:53:18.131 --> 00:53:21.340
<v Speaker 1>constitutes and then the next part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the discussion as well.</v>

845
00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:24.790
<v Speaker 1>If that's the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would a solution look like?</v>

846
00:53:24.850 --> 00:53:27.480
<v Speaker 1>Which be how could things be better than</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are now?</v>

847
00:53:27.481 --> 00:53:29.910
<v Speaker 1>What would that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would that actually look like?</v>

848
00:53:29.911 --> 00:53:31.500
<v Speaker 1>And then the next issue is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

849
00:53:31.650 --> 00:53:35.340
<v Speaker 1>what steps could you put into place to </v>
<v Speaker 1>start moving towards that goal?</v>

850
00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:39.370
<v Speaker 1>And that's all an exploratory process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

851
00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:40.213
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's a process that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically grounded in a search for the </v>

852
00:53:42.541 --> 00:53:43.374
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I found in my psychotherapy </v>

853
00:53:46.351 --> 00:53:51.150
<v Speaker 1>practice is that in so far as that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening during the discussions,</v>

854
00:53:51.151 --> 00:53:53.940
<v Speaker 1>then the process itself is </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily gripping.</v>

855
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:55.101
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

856
00:53:55.101 --> 00:53:55.581
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

857
00:53:55.581 --> 00:53:56.414
<v Speaker 1>I think you also experienced that </v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever you sit down with someone and </v>

858
00:53:59.131 --> 00:53:59.964
<v Speaker 1>have a conversation that serious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful conversation like that grips </v>

859
00:54:03.961 --> 00:54:04.650
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

860
00:54:04.650 --> 00:54:05.483
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason for that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you are in the right place at </v>

861
00:54:08.971 --> 00:54:10.380
<v Speaker 1>the right time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

862
00:54:10.381 --> 00:54:12.450
<v Speaker 1>And what you're doing is important and </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful.</v>

863
00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:16.140
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult though because you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to face up to what the problems actually</v>

864
00:54:16.141 --> 00:54:16.974
<v Speaker 1>are and you have to pay careful </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention and you have to run through </v>

865
00:54:19.261 --> 00:54:23.220
<v Speaker 1>all the options and you have to plan </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategically and you have to be careful</v>

866
00:54:23.221 --> 00:54:26.730
<v Speaker 1>about what you said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't get too self aggrandizing,</v>

867
00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:27.583
<v Speaker 1>Redo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>egotistical and you can't offer simple </v>

868
00:54:29.701 --> 00:54:33.870
<v Speaker 1>solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's an incredibly engaging process.</v>

869
00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:34.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

870
00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:38.070
<v Speaker 1>it's like reading the highest quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction in some sense.</v>

871
00:54:38.550 --> 00:54:41.910
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of conversations between </v>
<v Speaker 1>people can be like that.</v>

872
00:54:41.911 --> 00:54:42.744
<v Speaker 1>If both people who are engaged in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation and this is something </v>

873
00:54:46.471 --> 00:54:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Rogers pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

874
00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:52.980
<v Speaker 1>are willing to admit that there is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact the problem and then to do whatever</v>

875
00:54:52.981 --> 00:54:57.780
<v Speaker 1>is necessary to lay out the structure of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that broad meant to solve it and that's,</v>

876
00:54:58.110 --> 00:55:02.040
<v Speaker 1>that's admission of vulnerability too to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a large degree.</v>

877
00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:05.100
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me that that process </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually works,</v>

878
00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:07.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it facilitates trust,</v>

879
00:55:07.531 --> 00:55:09.450
<v Speaker 1>which is extraordinarily useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

880
00:55:09.451 --> 00:55:10.284
<v Speaker 1>with some of my clients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's taken me years before we can </v>

881
00:55:12.151 --> 00:55:17.010
<v Speaker 1>actually have a genuine conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're so afraid of engaging in</v>

882
00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:21.900
<v Speaker 1>a discussion that's actually real and </v>
<v Speaker 1>genuine and exposing their,</v>

883
00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:24.460
<v Speaker 1>their actual problems that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

884
00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:25.333
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hide often behind the sorts of </v>

885
00:55:27.091 --> 00:55:31.590
<v Speaker 1>things that you described as a persona.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't get to the real person because</v>

886
00:55:31.591 --> 00:55:32.424
<v Speaker 1>there's so covered up by a shell that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can't have a genuine </v>

887
00:55:37.171 --> 00:55:38.004
<v Speaker 1>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that's the case is </v>

888
00:55:39.531 --> 00:55:40.480
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

889
00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:44.250
<v Speaker 1>they've attempted to engage in genuine </v>
<v Speaker 1>interactions with people in the past and</v>

890
00:55:44.251 --> 00:55:46.770
<v Speaker 1>they've been betrayed or hurt or </v>
<v Speaker 1>undermined in some way.</v>

891
00:55:46.771 --> 00:55:47.604
<v Speaker 1>That's really profound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they learned that that's very </v>

892
00:55:49.741 --> 00:55:52.020
<v Speaker 1>dangerous to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly true,</v>

893
00:55:52.021 --> 00:55:54.510
<v Speaker 1>but it's a lot more dangerous not to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

894
00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:57.013
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

895
00:56:05.590 --> 00:56:06.423
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I hope for when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>teach this class and the other classes </v>

896
00:56:09.131 --> 00:56:09.964
<v Speaker 1>that I teach too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that people can come out of the </v>

897
00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:12.933
<v Speaker 1>classes with a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualization of what they might </v>

898
00:56:15.371 --> 00:56:17.930
<v Speaker 1>actually be like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

899
00:56:17.931 --> 00:56:21.040
<v Speaker 1>And I really do believe that people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>remarkable creatures,</v>

900
00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:24.520
<v Speaker 1>know the extent of our capacity by no </v>
<v Speaker 1>means known.</v>

901
00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:27.370
<v Speaker 1>And there's so much about what we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that we don't understand.</v>

902
00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:31.720
<v Speaker 1>We have no idea what it means that each </v>
<v Speaker 1>of us is a locus of consciousness.</v>

903
00:56:33.110 --> 00:56:34.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and obviously,</v>

904
00:56:34.690 --> 00:56:36.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know this,</v>

905
00:56:36.550 --> 00:56:40.180
<v Speaker 1>but the word genie is the root word of </v>
<v Speaker 1>genius.</v>

906
00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:43.510
<v Speaker 1>And the idea of the GE is a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting idea,</v>

907
00:56:43.511 --> 00:56:44.344
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because with a genie you have this </v>

908
00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:50.110
<v Speaker 1>incredible capacity for magical power in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense,</v>

909
00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:53.290
<v Speaker 1>all collapsed into this incredibly tiny </v>
<v Speaker 1>container.</v>

910
00:56:53.490 --> 00:56:54.323
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this weird constraint </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the divine possibility of the </v>

911
00:56:57.431 --> 00:56:58.264
<v Speaker 1>genie and the fact that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>encapsulated into this unbearably tiny </v>

912
00:57:01.571 --> 00:57:02.140
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

913
00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:02.973
<v Speaker 1>And in some senses trapped inside that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reason that genie is the root </v>

914
00:57:06.671 --> 00:57:09.670
<v Speaker 1>word of genius is because that's exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>what people are like,</v>

915
00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:10.973
<v Speaker 1>that we have this incredible capacity </v>
<v Speaker 1>for imagination and for speaking things </v>

916
00:57:14.081 --> 00:57:16.450
<v Speaker 1>into being and for acting things into </v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

917
00:57:16.451 --> 00:57:17.284
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're limited by our frame in time and </v>

918
00:57:21.011 --> 00:57:22.270
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It limits us,</v>

919
00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:26.500
<v Speaker 1>but it also allows us potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very strange set of limitations.</v>

920
00:57:27.250 --> 00:57:31.310
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I've wondered very </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply over the last 20 years is,</v>

921
00:57:31.311 --> 00:57:32.144
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people are often upset about the </v>

922
00:57:34.991 --> 00:57:35.824
<v Speaker 1>structure of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a good argument in the brothers </v>

923
00:57:38.501 --> 00:57:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Karamazov,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

924
00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:44.640
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brothers Karamazov features a very,</v>

925
00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:45.503
<v Speaker 1>a very large number of characters that </v>
<v Speaker 1>has a very Friday and eat a whole </v>

926
00:57:48.641 --> 00:57:50.740
<v Speaker 1>subplot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the,</v>

927
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:52.023
<v Speaker 1>one of the continual battles between </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters in the brothers Karamazov is </v>

928
00:57:55.151 --> 00:57:55.984
<v Speaker 1>a battle between a young man named </v>
<v Speaker 1>Elisha who is going to be a monk in a </v>

929
00:57:59.651 --> 00:58:03.730
<v Speaker 1>monastery and he's trying to live a </v>
<v Speaker 1>classically good life.</v>

930
00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:04.031
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

931
00:58:04.031 --> 00:58:07.710
<v Speaker 1>traditionally good life as it might've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been conceived of in 18,</v>

932
00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:10.930
<v Speaker 1>18 and 18 seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his brother Ivan,</v>

933
00:58:10.931 --> 00:58:13.180
<v Speaker 1>who is an older brother who's extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>

934
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:14.023
<v Speaker 1>charismatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and very rationalistic and arrogant and </v>

935
00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:19.173
<v Speaker 1>and creative and intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he likes nothing better than to go </v>

936
00:58:23.591 --> 00:58:24.424
<v Speaker 1>after her lowest share with all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories about the horrors of the world </v>

937
00:58:27.250 --> 00:58:28.083
<v Speaker 1>to try to undermine his faith in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>divinity that he's attempting to </v>

938
00:58:31.091 --> 00:58:31.924
<v Speaker 1>establish a relationship with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we tell stories like this is a story </v>

939
00:58:34.871 --> 00:58:35.704
<v Speaker 1>that does DSD took out of the newspaper </v>
<v Speaker 1>in approximately the time when he was </v>

940
00:58:40.241 --> 00:58:42.700
<v Speaker 1>reading the brothers Karamazov.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a story about this.</v>

941
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:44.343
<v Speaker 1>This family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this father and mother locked there are </v>

942
00:58:46.331 --> 00:58:49.660
<v Speaker 1>three or four year old daughter and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>freezing out house overnight.</v>

943
00:58:50.050 --> 00:58:50.883
<v Speaker 1>And she was screaming the entire time to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have someone let her out and they let </v>

944
00:58:54.401 --> 00:58:56.020
<v Speaker 1>her freeze to death and the outhouse.</v>

945
00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:58.330
<v Speaker 1>And of course that produced a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>scandal.</v>

946
00:58:58.331 --> 00:59:00.940
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that Ivan Ivan </v>
<v Speaker 1>uses,</v>

947
00:59:00.941 --> 00:59:01.774
<v Speaker 1>that story or Dostoevsky uses that story</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the brothers Karamazov so that Ivan </v>

948
00:59:05.591 --> 00:59:06.424
<v Speaker 1>can torture Lee Osha about the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know there's no way that you could </v>

949
00:59:09.551 --> 00:59:10.384
<v Speaker 1>possibly envision that being itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be good or that God could be good </v>

950
00:59:13.631 --> 00:59:14.464
<v Speaker 1>if you want to put it a different way </v>
<v Speaker 1>when that sort of thing can happen in </v>

951
00:59:16.961 --> 00:59:20.920
<v Speaker 1>the world and that it happens over and </v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over all the time,</v>

952
00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:21.763
<v Speaker 1>everywhere you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and and Dostoevsky because he's no </v>

953
00:59:24.891 --> 00:59:25.724
<v Speaker 1>piker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he sets up an argument between two </v>

954
00:59:27.291 --> 00:59:29.660
<v Speaker 1>positions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sets up the argument as powerfully as</v>

955
00:59:29.661 --> 00:59:30.494
<v Speaker 1>he possibly can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he has already been tell Osha </v>

956
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:33.463
<v Speaker 1>endless stories like that and make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>claim that as far as revenue is </v>

957
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:37.543
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the mere fact that any of those </v>

958
00:59:38.841 --> 00:59:40.190
<v Speaker 1>things could have ever happened.</v>

959
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:42.410
<v Speaker 1>Even once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A sufficient reason to never,</v>

960
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:46.070
<v Speaker 1>never allow yourself to conceptualize </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea.</v>

961
00:59:46.071 --> 00:59:46.904
<v Speaker 1>That being itself might be good fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ivan's presupposition is that it's evil </v>

962
00:59:51.861 --> 00:59:54.740
<v Speaker 1>enough so that it should be eradicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>in one.</v>

963
00:59:54.830 --> 00:59:55.663
<v Speaker 1>Any</v>
<v Speaker 1>any game that has that element of play </v>

964
00:59:59.901 --> 01:00:01.850
<v Speaker 1>and it is a game that should never be </v>
<v Speaker 1>played.</v>

965
01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:05.150
<v Speaker 1>That's basically Ivan stance and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a very.</v>

966
01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:08.150
<v Speaker 1>That's a very archetipal stance by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

967
01:00:08.151 --> 01:00:10.980
<v Speaker 1>It's the same stance that Mephistopheles</v>
<v Speaker 1>adoption group,</v>

968
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:11.833
<v Speaker 1>this faust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's the same stance that Lucifer </v>

969
01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:20.170
<v Speaker 1>adopts in paradise lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the rational opposition to be a and</v>

970
01:00:20.730 --> 01:00:21.563
<v Speaker 1>and it's a very powerful idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's something wrong about it </v>

971
01:00:24.801 --> 01:00:29.570
<v Speaker 1>because if you pursue that and you act </v>
<v Speaker 1>it out rigorously and consistently,</v>

972
01:00:29.571 --> 01:00:30.404
<v Speaker 1>then all that happens is you turn into </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who adds to the misery rather </v>

973
01:00:33.771 --> 01:00:37.520
<v Speaker 1>than putting an end to it and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things I've wondered is,</v>

974
01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:39.770
<v Speaker 1>and this is something that's worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about.</v>

975
01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:41.083
<v Speaker 1>If everybody abandoned their </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological nihilism and despair and </v>

976
01:00:44.211 --> 01:00:45.950
<v Speaker 1>did what they could to make things </v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

977
01:00:45.951 --> 01:00:46.784
<v Speaker 1>wherever they could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe we could turn the world into </v>

978
01:00:48.501 --> 01:00:52.220
<v Speaker 1>a place where that sort of thing didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen and then what?</v>

979
01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:54.260
<v Speaker 1>Then what would that be like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

980
01:00:54.261 --> 01:00:55.094
<v Speaker 1>because you ask yourself why have you </v>
<v Speaker 1>done everything you possibly can to put </v>

981
01:00:58.221 --> 01:01:01.190
<v Speaker 1>your life in order?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if the answer to that is no,</v>

982
01:01:01.191 --> 01:01:02.024
<v Speaker 1>then what makes you think you have any </v>
<v Speaker 1>right to complain about the conditions </v>

983
01:01:04.281 --> 01:01:08.420
<v Speaker 1>of your existence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a story in Tsl.</v>

984
01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:09.273
<v Speaker 1>Iots play the cocktail hour and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story involves a woman who's thinking </v>

985
01:01:13.281 --> 01:01:14.114
<v Speaker 1>about seeking psychiatric treatment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she approaches a psychiatrist and she </v>

986
01:01:17.931 --> 01:01:18.764
<v Speaker 1>basically says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really hope there's something wrong </v>

987
01:01:20.901 --> 01:01:23.360
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the psychiatrist says,</v>

988
01:01:23.361 --> 01:01:24.194
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you hope that there's something </v>

989
01:01:24.891 --> 01:01:26.450
<v Speaker 1>wrong with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she says,</v>

990
01:01:26.451 --> 01:01:27.284
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm having a really miserable time of </v>

991
01:01:28.491 --> 01:01:29.150
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

992
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:29.983
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means that there's only two </v>

993
01:01:31.641 --> 01:01:32.474
<v Speaker 1>options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either I'm doing something wrong and </v>

994
01:01:34.311 --> 01:01:35.144
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong with me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the reason that all this </v>

995
01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:39.200
<v Speaker 1>pointless suffering seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurring.</v>

996
01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Or there's something wrong with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of being per se that makes all</v>

997
01:01:43.431 --> 01:01:45.200
<v Speaker 1>of this inevitable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

998
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:48.710
<v Speaker 1>And that's a perfectly reasonable laying</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of two options.</v>

999
01:01:48.711 --> 01:01:49.670
<v Speaker 1>And so she says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1000
01:01:49.671 --> 01:01:50.504
<v Speaker 1>I hope that we can start to discover </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is that I'm doing wrong because </v>

1001
01:01:53.541 --> 01:01:57.590
<v Speaker 1>it would be a lot better if the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>things weren't so good was because I was</v>

1002
01:01:57.591 --> 01:01:58.424
<v Speaker 1>doing something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it would be if the reason that </v>

1003
01:02:00.531 --> 01:02:01.364
<v Speaker 1>things are wrong is because they're just</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong and there's nothing you can do </v>

1004
01:02:03.711 --> 01:02:05.300
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1005
01:02:05.301 --> 01:02:08.450
<v Speaker 1>it's an easy question to answer because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an existential question.</v>

1006
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:09.303
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the sort of thing that you can </v>

1007
01:02:09.921 --> 01:02:10.754
<v Speaker 1>only answer over the course of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire life and it's the sort of </v>

1008
01:02:13.701 --> 01:02:16.400
<v Speaker 1>question that no one else can answer for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1009
01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:17.563
<v Speaker 1>but one thing you can find out is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>what your life would be like if you </v>

1010
01:02:20.731 --> 01:02:23.130
<v Speaker 1>stopped making it unnecessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>miserable.</v>

1011
01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:24.593
<v Speaker 1>You know when to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to abandon your </v>

1012
01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:27.473
<v Speaker 1>dissatisfaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your vengefulness and your resentment </v>

1013
01:02:29.671 --> 01:02:33.600
<v Speaker 1>and your arrogance and your willful </v>
<v Speaker 1>blindness and all those things that stop</v>

1014
01:02:33.601 --> 01:02:34.434
<v Speaker 1>you from seeing what's right in front of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your face and try to make things as </v>

1015
01:02:36.871 --> 01:02:40.470
<v Speaker 1>straight as you possibly can in those </v>
<v Speaker 1>places that you can make them.</v>

1016
01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:42.053
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I can tell if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's what I teach my clients to </v>

1017
01:02:46.951 --> 01:02:49.530
<v Speaker 1>do in psychotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they do that,</v>

1018
01:02:49.531 --> 01:02:50.364
<v Speaker 1>their lives get a lot better and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know exactly how good your life could </v>

1019
01:02:54.181 --> 01:02:55.014
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that there's any </v>

1020
01:02:55.951 --> 01:03:00.951
<v Speaker 1>necessary upper limit so people can </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to set things right.</v>

1021
01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:02.101
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1022
01:03:02.101 --> 01:03:06.360
<v Speaker 1>the more you practice that in the places</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can actually practice it,</v>

1023
01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:09.630
<v Speaker 1>the better and better you get at that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more things that you can set.</v>

1024
01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:11.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1025
01:03:11.101 --> 01:03:13.200
<v Speaker 1>and then you're also not setting other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1026
01:03:13.201 --> 01:03:14.034
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which I also think there's something </v>

1027
01:03:15.361 --> 01:03:16.194
<v Speaker 1>extremely useful because my suspicions </v>
<v Speaker 1>are that you have enough to do just </v>

1028
01:03:19.261 --> 01:03:20.094
<v Speaker 1>setting yourself right without having to</v>
<v Speaker 1>worry about all the other people that </v>

1029
01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:24.570
<v Speaker 1>are running around mocking up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>

1030
01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:26.273
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't know what to do with them </v>

1031
01:03:27.161 --> 01:03:27.994
<v Speaker 1>many ways or what they should be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's just as well to start with </v>

1032
01:03:30.961 --> 01:03:31.794
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an extremely useful adventure and </v>

1033
01:03:34.861 --> 01:03:39.630
<v Speaker 1>it's something that will never allow you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to become board even for a moment.</v>

1034
01:03:40.410 --> 01:03:42.120
<v Speaker 1>And that's worth something to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1035
01:03:42.121 --> 01:03:42.954
<v Speaker 1>because even if life is fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering and there's nothing that can </v>

1036
01:03:46.201 --> 01:03:48.270
<v Speaker 1>be done about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a possibility,</v>

1037
01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:49.433
<v Speaker 1>there's always the possibility that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could learn to live in a manner so that </v>

1038
01:03:52.411 --> 01:03:56.310
<v Speaker 1>that suffering was actually justifiable </v>
<v Speaker 1>even to you because you might say,</v>

1039
01:03:56.311 --> 01:03:57.144
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm doing is so much worthwhile </v>

1040
01:03:58.321 --> 01:03:59.154
<v Speaker 1>that even if I have to suffer to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worth it and I would say that's </v>

1041
01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:02.693
<v Speaker 1>actually the ethical imperative for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life is that you're obliged to find </v>

1042
01:04:07.741 --> 01:04:11.550
<v Speaker 1>something to do and some way of doing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so deeply meaningful,</v>

1043
01:04:11.551 --> 01:04:12.384
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that you have to carry </v>
<v Speaker 1>around your mortal vulnerability is </v>

1044
01:04:15.721 --> 01:04:18.690
<v Speaker 1>something that you can accept and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>be happy about.</v>

1045
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Because the alternative is gloomy and DM</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's worse than that.</v>

1046
01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:26.103
<v Speaker 1>It's not just gloomy and DMD.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gloomy and dam and then it's </v>

1047
01:04:28.751 --> 01:04:30.880
<v Speaker 1>beneficial and then it's murderous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Ben,</v>

1048
01:04:30.881 --> 01:04:31.714
<v Speaker 1>it's genocidal and that seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that we could really do </v>

1049
01:04:35.261 --> 01:04:36.094
<v Speaker 1>without.</v>

1050
01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:41.040
<v Speaker 1>So I'm hoping that as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>having taken this course,</v>

1051
01:04:41.041 --> 01:04:41.874
<v Speaker 1>that you have some expanded idea of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might mean to be a human being and </v>

1052
01:04:45.631 --> 01:04:46.464
<v Speaker 1>that you can carry that with you as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>move forward in your life and find out </v>

1053
01:04:49.921 --> 01:04:50.754
<v Speaker 1>what you really liked and find out what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do if you put your mind to it </v>

1054
01:04:53.581 --> 01:04:57.000
<v Speaker 1>because God only knows what you could do</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you put your mind to it,</v>

1055
01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:59.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the more people who are doing that,</v>

1056
01:04:59.881 --> 01:05:00.714
<v Speaker 1>the better things are going to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that would be a good thing because </v>

1057
01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:06.180
<v Speaker 1>things aren't so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they could be a lot better.</v>

1058
01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:10.410
<v Speaker 1>And it's hard to say just exactly how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much you could contribute to that.</v>

1059
01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:14.070
<v Speaker 1>If you decided that that's what it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could do,</v>

1060
01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.620
<v Speaker 1>and I do believe that is what you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1061
01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:17.663
<v Speaker 1>I also believe that you are doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're shaping the world for better or </v>

1062
01:05:22.211 --> 01:05:23.044
<v Speaker 1>for worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of whether or not you decide </v>

1063
01:05:25.061 --> 01:05:29.620
<v Speaker 1>to do it and take on the responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're basically destined to do that.</v>

1064
01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:31.293
<v Speaker 1>So it seems to me that you should make </v>
<v Speaker 1>that conscious and decide if you're </v>

1065
01:05:34.181 --> 01:05:37.360
<v Speaker 1>going to do it properly or if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to make things worse.</v>

1066
01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:39.653
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1067
01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:49.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the other thing I have to say is</v>

1068
01:05:49.801 --> 01:05:54.150
<v Speaker 1>that I wish you luck as you proceed </v>
<v Speaker 1>through your university career.</v>

1069
01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:57.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is an awkward institution in</v>
<v Speaker 1>many ways and your,</v>

1070
01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:01.740
<v Speaker 1>your faceless and numbered while you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

1071
01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:03.053
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a place where it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that you're engaged in this </v>

1072
01:06:06.961 --> 01:06:07.794
<v Speaker 1>university means that the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>community has given you an identity </v>

1073
01:06:10.621 --> 01:06:14.160
<v Speaker 1>that's acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a student and that's an honorable</v>

1074
01:06:14.161 --> 01:06:14.994
<v Speaker 1>thing to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means that you can spend a few </v>

1075
01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:18.233
<v Speaker 1>years trying to learn the most important</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you have to learn and that </v>

1076
01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:21.653
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're granted a role that makes that </v>

1077
01:06:24.421 --> 01:06:26.880
<v Speaker 1>acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unjustifiable and I would say,</v>

1078
01:06:26.881 --> 01:06:28.680
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a couple of years here,</v>

1079
01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:31.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the wisdom of the world is collected</v>

1080
01:06:31.951 --> 01:06:32.784
<v Speaker 1>at the University of Toronto and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be discussed and displayed </v>

1081
01:06:36.361 --> 01:06:37.194
<v Speaker 1>awkwardly by your professors because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're incomplete incarnations of </v>

1082
01:06:41.461 --> 01:06:42.600
<v Speaker 1>historical wisdom.</v>

1083
01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:47.310
<v Speaker 1>But you should forgive them for that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to do everything you possibly can to</v>

1084
01:06:47.311 --> 01:06:51.300
<v Speaker 1>extract everything you possibly can out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this place while you're here.</v>

1085
01:06:51.301 --> 01:06:52.134
<v Speaker 1>Because if you do it properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's going to make your life a lot </v>

1086
01:06:54.931 --> 01:06:57.360
<v Speaker 1>richer and more productive than it could</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise be.</v>

1087
01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:58.650
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1088
01:06:58.651 --> 01:07:01.470
<v Speaker 1>what about getting a job?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>

1089
01:07:01.471 --> 01:07:02.304
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you learn to think and you learn to </v>

1090
01:07:03.661 --> 01:07:04.494
<v Speaker 1>speak and you learn to act properly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn how to be articulate and you </v>

1091
01:07:08.251 --> 01:07:11.040
<v Speaker 1>conduct yourself with a certain amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of wisdom and grace,</v>

1092
01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:12.053
<v Speaker 1>you'll never have to worry for one </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute in your life about what you're </v>

1093
01:07:14.311 --> 01:07:17.100
<v Speaker 1>going to do that will sustain you and be</v>
<v Speaker 1>productive.</v>

1094
01:07:17.101 --> 01:07:17.934
<v Speaker 1>Because people like that are an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably short supply and all the </v>

1095
01:07:21.721 --> 01:07:22.554
<v Speaker 1>people out there in the world who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense and there's quite a few </v>

1096
01:07:25.021 --> 01:07:28.860
<v Speaker 1>people like that are desperately looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>for people like that.</v>

1097
01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:32.370
<v Speaker 1>And if you happen to be one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will have more opportunities in your</v>

1098
01:07:32.371 --> 01:07:34.590
<v Speaker 1>life than you possibly know what to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

1099
01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:36.113
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think you have to worry too </v>
<v Speaker 1>much about exactly what you're going to </v>

1100
01:07:39.001 --> 01:07:41.250
<v Speaker 1>be or what role you're going to play </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you come out.</v>

1101
01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:42.323
<v Speaker 1>If you prepare yourself and you turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself into an articulate and honest </v>

1102
01:07:45.331 --> 01:07:46.164
<v Speaker 1>and educated person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like that are incredibly </v>

1103
01:07:48.751 --> 01:07:51.510
<v Speaker 1>valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as I said already,</v>

1104
01:07:51.511 --> 01:07:54.510
<v Speaker 1>if you transform yourself into someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's like that,</v>

1105
01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:57.960
<v Speaker 1>the world will open doors for you in </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways you can't possibly imagine.</v>

1106
01:07:58.290 --> 01:08:00.570
<v Speaker 1>It will happen in ways you don't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

1107
01:08:00.571 --> 01:08:01.404
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see this with students who do the </v>

1108
01:08:03.031 --> 01:08:04.920
<v Speaker 1>opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1109
01:08:05.130 --> 01:08:08.940
<v Speaker 1>so with my graduate students and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes with undergraduates as well,</v>

1110
01:08:08.941 --> 01:08:11.390
<v Speaker 1>I'll give one of them a job to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1111
01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:12.503
<v Speaker 1>and they'll either do it and do it well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are there come back and tell me why it </v>

1112
01:08:15.891 --> 01:08:16.724
<v Speaker 1>was impossible for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for them to do it and how many things </v>

1113
01:08:18.621 --> 01:08:19.460
<v Speaker 1>got in the way.</v>

1114
01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:20.713
<v Speaker 1>And the consequences of that is that for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person who comes and tells me that </v>

1115
01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:25.273
<v Speaker 1>they don't get another opportunity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the person who comes and does and </v>

1116
01:08:28.341 --> 01:08:32.420
<v Speaker 1>has done what I asked them to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe going over and above the,</v>

1117
01:08:32.790 --> 01:08:34.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the call of duty,</v>

1118
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.863
<v Speaker 1>then I have six more opportunities for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them or maybe 20 more opportunities for </v>

1119
01:08:39.231 --> 01:08:40.064
<v Speaker 1>them or maybe 50 more opportunities for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them because I have more opportunities </v>

1120
01:08:42.711 --> 01:08:43.544
<v Speaker 1>that I know what to do with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it turns out that if you're the </v>

1121
01:08:46.101 --> 01:08:48.770
<v Speaker 1>sort of person who is useful and direct </v>
<v Speaker 1>and honest,</v>

1122
01:08:49.070 --> 01:08:51.770
<v Speaker 1>then invisible doors will open for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

1123
01:08:51.771 --> 01:08:52.604
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then invisible doors will shut until no </v>

1124
01:08:55.641 --> 01:08:56.474
<v Speaker 1>doors are open and you'll think you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>curse fate for that and complaint about </v>

1125
01:09:00.051 --> 01:09:02.810
<v Speaker 1>the structure of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the reason it's like that is because</v>

1126
01:09:03.170 --> 01:09:04.003
<v Speaker 1>you didn't take the opportunities when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were offered to you and you didn't </v>

1127
01:09:07.011 --> 01:09:08.090
<v Speaker 1>do things properly.</v>

1128
01:09:09.170 --> 01:09:10.003
<v Speaker 1>So you can learn how to do things </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly at university and you can turn </v>

1129
01:09:14.331 --> 01:09:18.050
<v Speaker 1>yourself into someone who's a lot wiser </v>
<v Speaker 1>than you were when you first came here.</v>

1130
01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:21.230
<v Speaker 1>And there isn't anything that's more </v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable than wisdom and truth,</v>

1131
01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:24.770
<v Speaker 1>and so I would say you take the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of years while you're here.</v>

1132
01:09:25.010 --> 01:09:25.843
<v Speaker 1>See if you can turn yourself into </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's useful and honest and </v>

1133
01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:30.920
<v Speaker 1>you'll be so prepared for life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't be able to believe it,</v>

1134
01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:32.083
<v Speaker 1>and there's absolutely no reason to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>cynical about that because I seen how </v>

1135
01:09:35.361 --> 01:09:37.490
<v Speaker 1>the world works and that is how it </v>
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

1136
01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:39.013
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I wish you well while you attempt to </v>

1137
01:09:43.551 --> 01:09:45.290
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I hope that you've learned something</v>

1138
01:09:45.291 --> 01:09:46.124
<v Speaker 1>in this course that enables you to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in a manner that's more powerful </v>

1139
01:09:50.131 --> 01:09:50.964
<v Speaker 1>than richer and more worthwhile and less</v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic and less cynical and more </v>

1140
01:09:55.281 --> 01:09:58.280
<v Speaker 1>meaningful because that would be a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing if it happened.</v>

1141
01:09:58.880 --> 01:09:59.713
<v Speaker 1>And so it was a pleasure to teach you </v>
<v Speaker 1>this year and I wish you the best of </v>

1142
01:10:02.871 --> 01:10:04.850
<v Speaker 1>luck as you proceed through your </v>
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>

1143
01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:11.100
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
